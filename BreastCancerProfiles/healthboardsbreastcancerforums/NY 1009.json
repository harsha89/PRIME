      "Content": "Rapsodia, AGAIN! I'm late in wanting to catch up with you to find out how you've been doing and I can see by your reply that you are in need of a hug and some friendship. Forget him! I know it's easier said than done, but right now you have enough on your plate to worry about. He's really not a friend if he's going to be so insensitive to your feelings. don't let him destroy what little peace you may have. IF your biopsy winds up being malignant, you're going to need all the positive energy you can muster. Some people are just not worth it! Family is...... Friends are...... There's nothing you can do to make him pull away from this other person and make him come to you. HE has to want to do that. I don't waste time withe people anymore like I used to. I understand the pain you're feeling right now. A broken heart is hard to mend. try to ask yourself if this is what you want to deal with in your life??? Is it worth it for one person to make you unhappy? or would you rather be happy and enjoy your life? choose positive over negative. make a point of staying away from people who are going to make you feel sad or jealous. all these thoughts and feelings are negative and can make your health poor and your body acidic. It's true. it really can. our minds are connected with our health and body. did you ever notice how you can walk into a room and feel it polluted by someones bad mood, or bad attitude or feel their saddness? we can actually feel it. well the same feelings can course through your veins and through your connective tissues and cause havoc in the body. it causes illness. I wish we were close in distance because I'd be there right now girl knocking on your door to take you out for a long walk in nature, or taking you to a little restaurant where we can sit and talk and order one of your favorite meals. You don't need this man to make you happy, You need a \"friend\". Now.... to change the subject. You happened to mention that your breast hurts. the one that they took the biopsy out of. I was anxious to know what I'd be going through on the 4th, and now I know. due to you sharing what you went through. did you put ice on it for a certain length of time afterwards? I was told that I can drive myself home. which I was supposed to be driving my older sister to the airport the same morning I have my bilateral biopsies but now I can't. so my significant other is taking her instead. I wanted HIM to come with me, but I guess there's no need for him to. My 19 yr. old daughter may come with me just in case i\"m too sore to drive home. She just recently got her learners permit but I don't know how comfortable I'd be with her driving home. I am not a good candidate to sit in a passengers seat to someone learning how to drive. I make her nervous and she makes me MORE nervous!!!! I didnt' tell my sister yet that I won't be driving her, but as long as she has a ride, i\"m sure she won't care. I'm sure your mind is running rampant on you right now waiting to get the results. or did you already get it in? I know my mind is going nuts with thoughts and questions and what if it's cancer and if it is, what's going to happen next? it's all a process. my daughter asked me why can't the doctor test mine right away? I had to explain to her that there's other surgeries that were set up before I came into the picture and that I had to wait for a slot to open where they can put me in for a bilateral. So I might be going by myself. all the woman in the waiting area where the lockers and chairs are, which is a separate area than the waiting room you come into when you open the door to the office. I still have visions of us sharing small nervous smiles at one another, wondering what each one is going through. We're all wearing the stark white robes that one puts on for the examination or biopsy. it's so quite there you can hear a pin drop, even though the t.v. is on to distract ourselves from thinking too much, it's almost impossible to really understand what's being said on the t.v. forget about reading one of the many magazines that lay there in a messy pile, that I tried to organize one early morning the day of my utlra sound. I go into a cleaning frenzy when I\"m nervous. I call it \"nervous energy\" which I used to have all the time. Now I have to PUSH myself to clean at times or wait till I have a good day where i\"m not suffering some sort of joint pain and swelling. I deal with chronic pain almost on a daily basis. I see a rheumy dr. who's trying to find the culprit. then to be hit with the news of having a potential case of b.c. only adds to the annoying problems in my already painful life. Mentally and physically. so you see? I know what you're going through, pain wise, broken heart wise, etc. I just want you to know that if you ever need a shoulder to lean on, or need to talk about it, I'm here for you. PLEASE let me know if you got the results back. hang in there. God may bring you to it, but he will get you through it. sincerely, Linda",

      "Content": "Hi Kitty, My reply is a little late. I wish I had ck'd my mail sooner so I can keep up with replies to me. Are you going this coming Thursday to the surgeon for the results? or did I miss it? I'm so confused lately with numbers and dates and doctors, etc. I feel like my mind is having a melt down and it's really beginning to frighten me. I pray to God that there isn't something malignant in the results. I'd be extremely worried too just by what you told me is in there. and the fact that the first doctor had only come across one case of a phyllodes turmor. I vagually remember seeing that name in one of my readings but I didnt pay close attention to it, and now I wish I had so I'd know more about what it is you have. I'll do a search on it when I\"m done writing this to you. we as woman HAVE to be concerned with the possibility of lumps or lesions being possibly malignant. we have to be our own advocates and from now on I do not trust all doctors like I used to. more and more I\"m hearing of mis-diagnosis. I am happy to see you went to a different doctor. that first one really scared me after what he said to you and only watching it all these years instead of pursuing further testing and even a biopsy. I think in the five years of your initial findings, breast problems have risen significantly and more doctors are becoming aware not to wait or fool around with any thing that looks suspicious in a breast. they've come a long way in such a short amount of time. look at all the different types of biopsies and different types of treatment now if one has a cancer? Not even just ten or more years ago, if one had been told they have breast cancer, it was death sentance. there was a very respectible woman who lived in my hamlet who was well loved and recognized for her devotion for the committies in the school's for all children. plus she had four children all young. when I found out she had a reaccurance at the ten year point after her inital dx with bc, she died. It broke my heart and freaked me out till this day. If it had been NOW, 2009, I'll bet you we wouldn't have lost her. sorry to go on about this subject, but as you can see, it really traumatized me. I don't want this happening to you or to any other woman because of someone else's negligence. that's why if we as woman have a feeling something is wrong and a doctor just pooh pooh's it away, I say go with your gut instinct and find a doctor that WILL listen. and you have. which is a great thing. you're never going to believe what happened to me the day I had my ultra sound apptn. when I woke up that morning, I had a feeling something was going to go wrong and I even CALLED the hospital in advance to try and confirm the apptn that was set for 8 a.m. I thought that was kind of early, and no one would answer the phone in the office, so I spoke w/the hospt. operator and she told me that they open at 7 a.m. so I decided I'll just go anyway. I was so excited that finally it was the day to get an answer. I get there and the secretary says', your not in the system for today and it's for the 7th of May. I somehow miraculously was able to remember the girls name that booked the apptn. and she did work there but wasn't there at the moment. I raised my voice a little because I was angry and hurt and the girl told me they had a 9:30 cancellation and would I like to hang around till then? I opted to wait. wait is what I did. it was a long wait too. I finally go back to the office, get dressed in the pretty white robe they give every woman, get into the exam room on the table, and this wonderful technician told me that the dr. was performing 2 biopsies and me in betweeen them from room to room and that it could be anywhere like 2 hours for me to be seen and do I want to wait? now why on earth didn't the secretary first tell me this? I told her I want to make sure that the dr. is not rushed when she's examining me and opted to reschedule. I got redressed, while the tech was apologizing and they both tried to fit me into a slot the day the dr. wasn't perorming a biopsy around my apptin. so NOW i have to wait till May 11th to do this exam. I am asking myself why on earth does this radiolgist want me to have anotehr ultra sound when I JUST had one last month but in a different facility and read by a different doctor? Is she conceited and thinks that she's the best? I don't understand why the hold up? I just want to get his over with so I can either have a yes or no answer? this makes me more stressed out more than anything! and this so called facility is purposely set up with all the types of dr's one needs if they have a dx of b.c. this way they're all in one spot up the hall way from one another so they can all consult together instead of being in separate towns and which makes the woman or man the most comfortable and not to have to suffer any undo stress. like having to wait for a biopsy result or a reading result of an MRI or ct scan or mammo, etc. this radiolgist tells the patient right then and there what she sees'. but the say I had my MRI, she wasn't there. so I never got an answer till I saw my breast surgeon. the surgeon apolgozied for that happening. all I heard was sometimes MRI\"S read false positive's and that she wants me to get a MRI guided or ultra sound guided biopsy on a lesion they see AFTER the radiologist performs this ultra sound we're waiting to get done. so you can see why I'm aggitated? I found a radiology info sight that explains in detail what exactly the words mean on MRI findings. It really really helped me understand what the words meant on my reading. I book marked it and if you're interested in reading it, I'll give you the place to go to. it's just 1 page of information. I don't know if I'm permitted to do this here? I wanted to know what ovoid enhancing foci meant, and what did segmental pattern mean? plus what is rapid enhancement vs slow enhancement mean? these are the questions I was seeking answers for. just to help ease my imagination of what they might mean? this was a long winded reply and I hope I didn't bore any of you. I hope you get this reply Kitty, please let us know how you made out. I'll be praying for you sweetie. Sincerely, Linda",

      "Content": "Rapsodia, sorry it took me so long to get back to you. I initially wrote you a long reply and then had to delete it all because I had an emergency to tend to the other day and didn't think of saving it and then coming back to it another time. what type of biopsy was performed? a fine needle? or a core needle biopsy guided by Ultra sound? or mammo? from reading I do know there about four different types depending on the size and location of the tumor or if it's a cyst or solid. I agree with you about reading too much. it can put more fear into our already nervous minds. the waiting is the worst thing of all. I did go for the ultra sound on Friday and the radiologist confirmed that I do need to have a biopsy. a bilateral biopsy because she see's something in the left breast as well. but feels the one in the left may be just benign because of the shape of it, just like you mentioned about your shape. whether it be taller vs wider, etc. I wound up making an apptn for the biopsy wtih the radiologist because she performs them in this womans breast facility. not realizing, all I was supposed to do was get the ultra sound performed by her, get her opinion on whether it matched up with the MRI and then go see my breast surgeon. well did I cause problems between the two doctors. leave it up to me to cause chaos.... such drama. now my breast surgeon thinks the radiologist was trying to take her patient away. but it's all been fixed and the surgeons nurse called me to reschedule the apptn., WITH the breast surgeon who went onto explain in detail how she is going to numb the breasts, then make a small incision where she will perform the core biopsy and then put in two titanium markers that won't effect me or hurt me. I was told I wont' need any type of sedative so I can drive myself home and return to normal activities the same day. it's so different than it used to be compared to when my sisters had their diagnosis of breast carcinoma and the biopsy that she went through. times are changing swiftly and if we were ever going to get a dx of BC, now would be the time to have it rather than the past because they're able to catch it earlier and earlier now which means better and quicker treatment while in the beginning stages rather than later when it's harder to treat. my date is set up for June 4th at 9am. I\"m not nervous about it. and like you said, it's a 50/50 chance. doctors are taught not to show their emotions. and I find that most of them always say \"they feel it's nothing\" and or \"not to worry\". that's what was said to my 1st sister dx'd with BC. her dr. told her he thought everything looked good when he did the biopsy so she left there thinking she didn't have cancer. was she ever shocked when she got the news. so it's better to go in with the attitude it may be cancer, this way you can at least handle the news if it winds up being malignant. Did you get your results back yet? Hope you get this reply and hope you are doing well. best wishes, Linda",

      "Content": "Hi Kitty, I find it to be one of the hardest things to do is to \"not go crazy\" over a lump or cyst or what ever a growth they want to call is in our breasts. Kitty, Are these cysts, or cluster,perhaps \"lymph nodes\"???? because lymph nodes can appear fluid filled in an ultra sound, right? so it would make sense to me that maybe the surgeon couldn't aspirate it at the time because maybe a more extensive biopsy needs to be performed? it's just a thought. Maybe a lymph node needs to be biopsied with a different tool than the one he used and maybe that's why it didn't pull out any fluid? They say it's such a very small % that lymphoma ever winds up being in the breast. but there are certain forms out of the 30 different sub-types of lymphomas that grow and go back down. The less dangerous forms do that. they call it \"wax and wane\" when it enlarges and goes back down from time to time. you also asked that if the cyst went down, does that mean the lump also went down? I would think that if the fluid is what enlarged the capsule that the fluid is inside of, it would go down. to an extent or maybe all together. I\"m not sure how to answer this question? but I can totally understand you wanting to ask questions when you're going through something as serious as this. you don't want to take this lightly. That's why we have these boards to come to. to come and talk and share our concerns and fears. so please don't feel awkward asking questions or just wanting to come and talk about it. I am relieved to hear that you're going for a follow up ultra sound this Friday. Please let us know what happens. I am also relieved to hear you're going back to the dr the following week. Will the dr. call you and let you know the results the same day or next day of the U/S? You can call him the next day if he doesn't call you the same day. depending on the doctor and how busy he is. May I ask what other type of breast problems you had? did you have any fibroadenomas? and if you did, what did they recommend you do? did you ever consider asking your surgeon if he'd refer you to have an MRI of your breast? Just to be on the safe side? I find that the MRI would be able to see more than the ultra sound would. and it seems that more and more doctors are using this choice of modality on woman who have breast problems. I do NOT trust the mammo's and ultra sound by themselves anymore. There are certain forms of cancer that dont' show up on them. but they do on the MRI's. so I think anyone with a history of problems should also have the MRI performed as well. but then again, I'm not a doctor and doctors don't like when the patient tells them what to do. I\"m going tomorrow for my 2nd ultra sound but by a different radiologist than the previous place I went to a few weeks ago. The radiologist wants to perform it herself and then wants me to get a biopsy performed because the MRI w/contrast showed a 2cm, growth, besides both breasts also having what they think may be fibroademas and or a benign proliferative condition, plus enlarged lymph nodes in the breast. I have such a long story to share about what happened but I think i\"d have to start my own separate post on it. You and I both have our apptns' a day apart. I\"m here for you kitty if you want to talk about it. that's what this forum is for. so don't feel funny. I did at first when I first joined them here, but I don't feel that way anymore. Hang in there... Friday will be here before you know it. Good Luck hon. Sincerely, Linda",

      "Content": "This is EXCELLENT news Rhapsodia!!! Thank GOD it's benign. but you have to be extra careful when you get fibroadomas because of your age now. Is this why your surgeon put in the titanium markers? a very small percentage of them have the potential risk of turning malignant, that's why they have to really watch it. What exactly did your report read from the radiologist that wound up having to make you have the biopsy? was it an MRI? or an Ultra sound? or the mammo? I'm sorry I forget which modality it was and i\"m too lazy to go back and read your first post on it. you know.... I never asked the radiologist OR the surgeon what exactly they see. Isn't that insane? she didn't mention the right breast which is the one we intially wanted to exam more thouraghly, so when i was on the table having the test performed by the radiologist herself, she did say that she sees something in the left breast too and wants to biopsy to be on the safe side and feels it's just a normal fibroadoma because of the shape of it. she didn't say that about the thing they see in my right breast. I do have the measurements of it on the reading from the MRI. I still didn't have a chance yet to retrieve the written report of the 2nd ultra sound that I just had. I want that sheet. I can call the office to ask them to fax it to me, but I just can't get myself to do it today. This sheet may explain in more detail to me. I do know they wanted the 2nd ultra sound in their facility to see if it's matching up with the MRI they gave me, which is what signaled them to do a biopsy. this is what the MRI report said: FINDINGS: Scattered islands of fibroglandular tissue are present. In the lower aspect of the right breast at approx. 5 to 6:00 there are ovoid enhancing foci in a segmental pattern on images 30 to 34 with the most anterior component on image 32 measuring 9 x 4 x 9 mm with rapid initial enhancement and plateau delayed phase. In combined dimension this area measures approx. 2.5 x 1.8 x 2.8 cm In the remainder of the breasts bilaterally there are scattered enhancing round and ovoid foci in a stippled type pattern that are likely due to areas of benign proliferative condition and/or fibroadenomas. The largest of these on the left are located at 8 to 9:00 on images 32 to 38 in the central breast measuring approx. 6 mm each of progressive kinetics and linear nonenhancing septa. IMRESSION: Segmental enhancement at 5 to 6:00 in the mid to posterior third of the right breast. The largest component of this is oivid with plateau delayed phase. This could represent an area of fibroadenomatoid change. In the remainder of the breasts bilaterally there are enhancing foci present as above that are likely due to areas of benign proliferative condition and/ or fibroadenomas. A second look bilateral breast ultrasound is recommended for further evaluation. ( which I had) If there is no ultra sound correlative, MRI guided biopsy of the anterior of segtmental enhancement at 5 to 6:00 in the right breast is recommended and if this is benign, 6 month follow up breast MRI is recommended. My surgeon was happy we can do it by ultra sound rather than the MRI guided which makes it easier for her and me. I'm not worried about this too much because it sounds more benign than cancerous. they're just being super good in wanting to biopsy the left breast too. I feel I am in very competant hands, rather than the idiot breast specialtist I saw years ago for four yrs in a row. he never mentioned ONCE to me to get an ultrsound or an MRI because of both of my sisters having had breast cancer. I even found 3 enlarged lymph nodes and asked him if this was ok. he told me they were just part of the breast tissue. but I dont' have them on my left and the one in the middle is getting larger. I had the radiologist at the new place go over them too and she agreed that they are indeed lymph nodes. I became a little concerned when they popped out and even more concerned they stayed. this was BEFORE I was sent for an Ultra sound and an MRI and now a biopsy. why did they enlarge? why only on the right breast only? it can't be seen on a mammography because it's too far along the edge of the breast to be put on the plate. but the ultra sound did pick it up. not the MRI though which is a good thing I guess. the surgeon and I previously discussed when I went for a visit to get the results of the MRI weeks ago that she'd also biopsy these nodes for me being it bothered me. she didn't seem to be too concerned but said she'd do if for me. that made me feel good that she actually listened to me or cares enough to listen to me. I have so much to say for a person who's not overly concerned i need a bilat biopsy, huh? I am so happy for you. but what did your doctor say to do next? have a follow up MRI on it in six months? oh, did they leave the titanium markers in your breast or take them out? and if they leave them in, how long do they leave them in? Is this standard procedure for ALL breast biopsies? I haven't had a chance to even ask the surgeon this. I thought maybe you might know being it happened to you also? I sent you a message, so don't forget to go to the very top of this page at the right hand corner, where it says\" PRIVATE MESSAGES:\" and it's underlined in black. it will tell you how many you have there and if theyr'e read or not. To send a message to someone you first have to invite them to be a friend first I think. you add them as a contact and as a friend. there's both options. You personally have to go to your \"settings\" and put in a check mark that you want to receive private messages. because when I tried to send you a message, it stated that \"Rhapsody\" has it marked where you don't want to recieve them. so go to your settings and edit it. let me know if you ever recieved my message so I know to go back and write another one once you edit your settings. the \"settings\" info is in a box on the left hand side of your screen, along with other options. thank you SO much for letting me know what happened. Now you can take a deep breathe and relax, for the moment anyway. who knows when it will happen again when you have lumpy breasts. I never had them before either, not until now at age 48. but I'm also on estrogen patches which makes me have to be extra careful on my exams and follow ups. I can't live comfortably with out my estrogen replacement therapy. I was falling apart phsycially and mentally. I was so sick now that I look back. I am afraid to come off of them. the surgeon said she wants me to try to and if we find that I STILL am getting horrible symptoms due to menopausal symptoms caused by the total hysterectomy back in 2005, then she'll let me get back on them. we'll see. everything is about \"waiting\"..... boy am I learning patience, more so now than I ever did in my entire life!

      "Content": "Anag, I have the same exact thing going on too. I'm just starting to look through the forums to see if anyone else has had the same experience. can you feel yours? where exactly on the breast are they situated? I have multiple ones, but all under 1cm and mine are situated on the far edge of the breast. along the edge of the right breast, but along the ribs kind of. hard to explain, but mine couldn't be picked up on the yearly mammos' because it would be impossible to get that part of the body onto the mammo plates. I even specifically told the technician two years ago that I felt them and they couldn't get them to rest on the mammo plate. Someone should've requested an ultra sound then. Now it's two years later and I went for an annual ck up at my gyno and told her my right breast is feeling some changes in it. it's denser and alot more bumpier than it's ever been. I'm on straight estrogen because of a total hysterectomy I had to have four yrs ago. BOTH of my sisters have had breast cancer and one had to have both breasts removed. the other sister had to go on tamoxifen for years which eventually made her cyst dissapear. she had the pre malignancy type of cancer thing going on. A cyst kept coming back on one of her breasts. they at first watched it, then they biopsied it, and that's when the surgeon sent her to an oncologist. she had horrible sweats from that medication but it saved her life so far. I got off the subject, sorry....... I'm just trying to give you an outline of my family history, so I dont' want to take any lump lightly that grows on my breast. NO one should. how large is your lymph node? I was shocked to see they want to do a fine needle biopsy because I thought that I didnt have to really worry because it's just lymph nodes enlarged and not a mass. but as i'm seeing, you have an excellent doctor who really investigates things. what date do you have set up for the biopsy of the lymph node? do you get mammo's every year? have you had a problem before in your past? Please keep us informed of your progress if you have the time. it would be greatly appreciated to find out how it all went. I wish you the best outcome of your situation. sincerely, Linda",

      "Content": "No Kitty, I never heard this before. when was the time inbetween the pictures were taken of the cysts from the time you went to the dr.. to have it aspirated? maybe they can go down within a day or so? especially being it was there one day and gone the next? it might fluctuate with your cycle. I dont' know how old you are and if you're still cycling? I DO know that sometimes cysts turn out to be malignant. I know for a fact because it happened to one of my older sisters. My sister had this cyst that would keep coming back after the dr. had aspirated it and then he biopsied it and it turned out there were malignant cells in it. she was sent to an oncologist and was put on tamoxafin for YEARS and finally is finished with the regimine. it made the cyst go away and she still has to go for follow ups to the oncologist. My other sister,who's ten years old than I am wound up having breast cancer also. but her case was different. she had missed her mammo two years in a row and finally went for it. she recieved a call that they found calcifications and that she needed a biopsy. the surgeon told her at the time of the biopsy that it all looked fine and that she didn't have to worry about a thing. so she was shaken up when she recieved a phone call from the dr. telling her the biopsy was positive for cancer. she wound up having both breasts removed because they couldn't perform a lumpectomy because there was no lump. she was in and out of the hospital so quickly. I was shocked that they sent her home the next day or two after the surgery. she never opted for the breast reconstruction which also surprised me. both sisters each had different forms of breast cancer. Plus I just found out one of my Aunts in Slovakia died of breast cancer many years ago too. my dad died of colon cancer from complications post opt and brother number 3 had hodgkins lymphoma. we have a very lumpy, bumpy family history for sure. I wish you the best Kitty. Please come back to let us know how you made out. sincerely, Linda",

      "Content": "it's good to hear back from you so quickly Annamarie, I wasn't sure if you'd get my reply. You don't feel a thing huh? they really said \"bug bite\"? what on earth does a bug bite have to do with an enlarged node in your underarm? where would the bug have bitten you? By the way, I didn't think at all that you're an alarmist. You have every reason in the world to do as much research as you possibly can at this point. especially being they want to do a needle biopsy of the node. I am very anxious to find out how large the node is since they feel a biopsy is warranted. I read somewhere yesterday along my research that a node anything above 2cm is cause for a biopsy. But at another site another time, I read anything above 1cm. So I dont' know now how large they consider it to be a red flag? I really wish you the best. I'm sure you're shocked at the sudden news. Did you have former mammo's? and if so, are they going to compare it to last years and the one before that? the reason I ask is because when I made my apptn with the breast surgeon's office, the secretary told me I must bring the most recent mammo and the one before that, plus the image of the ultra sound with reports. so I went yesterday to the hospital file dept. to get my copies. they put all 3 on a cd , plus gave me written reports. I read the 2007 and 2008 reports and compared them. After I have my mammo's, they send a letter stating the mammo was all clear. they don't send the orgininal letter that is sent from the radiologist to the ordering dr. so I was surprised when I read one of the mammo's results that said: \"dense breast parenchymal pattern\" which limits resolution. patients in this category should adhere to ACR guidelines of regular mammography, breast self palpation and regular clinical breast examination by health professionals. PLUS they saw ovoid densities projected over the pectoralis muscles which are compatible with lymph nodes\" My doctor said NOTHING to me about the lymph nodes that were seen. the radiologist was not concerned, obviously since they didn't tell me anything about it. But at the end of the sonogram report, it states that \"further assessment of palpable abnormality should be determined on clinical grounds\". WHAT DOES THIS TERMINOLOGY MEAN? specifically \" CLINICAL GROUNDS\"? do they think I should definetly get it checked out? or does it mean only if the dr warrants it? am I being an alarmist? I'll be thinking of you on Thursday and if you need to talk, just fire away, I'm here for you. I won't tell you to try and relax, because I know I wouldn't be able to relax. But I will say, try to think positive and before you know it, Thursday will be here and you'll finally get the results. I wish you the best. What time do you have to go in? sincerely, Linda",

      "Content": "Hi rapsodia, I wish you peace and that the time goes by fast for your upcoming biopsy. I pray that it's benign. have you ever had to go through this before? what is the difference between the two biopsies? why do some have an MRI guided biopsy and other's have an ultra sound guided biopsy? how long did you have your fibroadoman before they saw that it may be changing? and how did they find it? did a mammogram pick it up too? or just the ultra sound? Did you ever have an MRI of the fibroadoma? I have SO many questions because I too have something that needs further investigation and I'm trying to jsut forget about it, till I get the 2nd U/S from a different radiologist who happens to be the director of this new breast imaging center that I was referred to by my gyno. my gyno initially sent me for an ultrasound of my dense right breast. they saw something, she referred me to a breast surgeon who sent me for an MRI, and now the radiologist usually tells the patient the same day of the MRI the results. but she wasn't there at that time. so I had to wait a few days for my results. breast surgeon then told me this radiologist wants to do her own ultra sound on it than go by the 1st set I had done at a different facility. the 2nd U/S is coming up this friday and I'll get an answer as to whether she thinks I should get it biopsied. my family wants me to get the biopsy anyway. My breast surgeon spoke to me as if we were going to do it soon but after the ultra sound. so I don't know who to listen to? the radiologist who's not treating my breast issue? or my breast surgeon who I was initially referred to? I'm very confused and just want to get this over with and know for sure if i have a malignancy or NOT! so I can understand totally what you're going through, nerve wise. I'm here for you. PLEASE come back and give us an update. i'll be looking for a reply from you. OK? I wish you the best. sincerely, Linda",

      "Content": "FVF, Can you get a copy of the report that was sent to your doctor? this way you can see exactly what the radiologist is seeing and why they feel it's ok for you to watch it and wait. waiting is the most difficult thing to do, I know, because I too was told that the ultrasound I had initially because I complained my right breast felt abnormal when I examined it and didn't feel the same as it usually does. so my gyno sent me for an u/s and told me they they feel I could either wait for 6 months to do a repeat or to see a breast surgeon to get their opinion on it. I chose to see the breast surgeon. she told me she felt that the breast felt normal and that there was really nothing abnormal looking from the nodes they saw enlarged and told me if I wanted to, I could have her look at my mammo that won't be performed till this coming Fall which I told her no, that's ok. if she's not worried, then I won't be either. I left her office, thinking I was in the clear, went home, about an hour later the phone rang and it was the surgeon explaining to me she had the time to go over the questionere they have you fill out of your personal and family hisotry and that I'm at high risk for breast cancer, being both my sisters had it and grandmother died of ovarian cancer and dad died of colon cancer, and told me she wanted me to go for an MRI. went for the MRI, MRI showed things in both breasts, had to have another ultra sound but at their facility so their radiologist who deals specifically with breasts can do the test herself. she did it, it correlated with the MRI and then I was told they wanted me to have a bilatarall breast biopsy, ultra sound guided, instead of the MRI guided, which is easier out of the two, not only for me, but for the dr as well. I just had it yesterday, both of my breasts are very sore today, plus two titanium markers were put in for future referrence to where both abnormalities are, being their only 2cm large, which is small to them and was difficult to locate on the ultra sound. I have to go next thurs for post op and dr. told me they said the pathology report won't be in till then. IF she gets an answer before that day, she promised to call me. so this all came out of having an ultra sound. I always knew I was considered high risk, but the breast specialtist I was seeing for years and then stopped going to him because i had so many clear mammo's, when my 3 lymph nodes popped up on the side of my breast, he told me , 'oh it's normal' it's just part of the breast\" and he NEVER ever sent me for an ultra sound even though I'm high risk. I was never told that mammo's dont' always pick up certain cancers. I always thought they did! this new breast surgeon I'm seeing said I have to have ultra sounds along with mammo's every year. I don't know what my results are going to be, but I do know that MRI\"S have ALOT of false positives. this is why I'm not nervous that they think they see something. the radiologist did look at the 3 nodes along the side of the breast with ultra sound and is not worried about them. she said they dont' look malignant. I want to know too why they came out. the other breast doesnt have them there! PLUS there's enlarged nodes in the breast itself. inflammatory reasons can make nodes enlarged. If I were you, I'd suggest your dr get authorization for an MRI if you dont' want to wait 6 months. it's your body and you're the one that hires the doctor. if this dr won't do anything about it for you, then maybe another will. worrying is not going to help you in the least. it only causes more stress. so to put your mind at ease, your dr should respect how you feel. please let us know what you're going to do next. I'm curious to know as to why they're enlarged myself. good luck to you and good luck on your studies too. there is so much helpful information out there on the web. I did some and it really helped me out alot. that's why I'm not nervous about my biopsies. I'd rather have a biopsy and have it be benign instead of not haveing the biopsy and have to worry whether it's malignant or not or to have to worry and wait six months to have a folllow up. the biopsy was a breeze. there's nothing to it. just soreness. that's all. and I am not good at tolerating pain. so believe when I tell you, it's nothing. sincerely, linda",

      "Content": "Looksee1, what were the results? I hope everything went well for you and that you won't need a biopsy. but then again, I'd rather wind up having a biopsy either way. I want to know for sure without a doubt that it is not malignant. yeah, insurance companies. they usually want the patient to go for other testing FIRST, then they'll pay for you to have the MRI if an ultra sound was peformed first. I used to work in a doctors office and I was the one that had to call to get authorization for our patients. thank Goodness they permitted you to have it. now we're waiting to see what happened. hope you get this reply. Shisslak, thank you for explaining the negatives positives and how common it is. it's all getting twisted and confused to me. the false positives, the negative positive, etc. its' all mind boggling. I finally went for the ultra sound. I had to wait soooo long for the radilogist to come in a do the exam herself after her technician had already done it. that's what she does with every single patient of hers. I just found out too that my breast surgeon always orders an ultra sound before a biopsy too. the technician couldn't see what the MRI picked up so I thought I was going to be home free from having the biopsy. so when the radiologist doctor did the exam herself, she found it right away. the technician watched her perform the exam as well. this way she learns more. the doctor said that if I hadn't had the MRI, that anyone could have missed the lesion what the MRI picked up. Plus she has a well trained eye being she's also the director of this facility and her years experience doing this. she also found something in the left breast as well. but stated that she thinks the one in the left breast looks like it might just be benign because of the shape it but wants to make absolutely sure and will biopsy that too. so I'm going to have the needle core biopsy, not the fine one, and it will be bilaterall. I thought I had to make the apptn. with the radiologist doctor for the biopsy so when I went to the front office to book the apptn. the girl asked me what type of biopsy. I was surprised the dr. hadn't gone to HER first so I didnt' have to tell her. now I know why. I made a mistake. I was supposed to just have the ultra sound and then call my breast surgeon to let her know I had the exam and then we'd go from there. so I'd already made the apptn. w/the radiologist and the girl told me to call my brst surgeons office to tell them about a script that will be needed. so you can imagine my confusion when my breast surgeon wound up calling me two hours later after I got home stating that the radiolgist and her spoke and both of them agreed that I need a biopsy and she said lets make an appointment. that's when I told her I already did and it was for June9th. they couldnt' fit me in earlier because a bilaterral takes 1 1/2 hour slot. the girl didn't want me to wait this long but I told her it's ok. I had no other choice and that if someone cancelled to call me. anway, the dr. said she couldnt' believe the radiologist was trying to steal her patient away from her. I was SO embarrassed that I caused all this ruckus. it was MY fault. not the other doctor. I finally got a chance to explain this to the surgeons office this morning when they called me to set up another date becasue we cancelled the biopsy w/the radiologist. so NOW it's going to be peformed on June 4th at 9:00 a.m. finally. a set time. the surgeon explained to me in detail what will take place. how they're going to put in a needle to numb my breasts, which will be guided by ultra sound biospy. they'll make a small incision, take out the samples, then put in titanium markers for future use if more surgery will be needed. this way she'll know where the exact spot is, being it's difficult to see it, they'll put a bandaide on each incison and then I can go home. easy isnt' it? then comes having to wait for the pathologist to read it. did you have any instincts or feelings that yours was going to be benign? I wonder if woman have instincts? I just read somewhere that there are no symptoms if it's caught early. that's the whole purpose of doing more extensive imaging so that it can be caught in an early stage which means a better course of treatment and a successfull rate of recovery. I'm a little nervous about this I have to admit. after all, I grew up fearing the word breast cancer. because it used to be that breast cancer was a death sentance. but now with all the new technology and new treatments and early detection, we dont' have to feel that it's the end of our lives if we wind up getting it, right? I'm right on this, correct? oh well, at least I finally got the ultra sound performed and now know whether I needed the biopsy or not. that part was really getting to me. I'll be back to let you know what happened. till then, take care of yourselves. sincerely, Linda",

      "Content": "Looksee1, You are not being paranoid in the LEAST! I was just told by my new breast surgeon two weeks ago upon 1st visit that just being a WOMAN puts me at risk for getting breast cancer. both of my sisters have had breast cancer and one of my aunts. Plus my dad had colon cancer and brother hodgkins lymphoma. I am at higher risk than others, but that does't necessarily mean i will wind up getting breast cancer. just being a woman these days puts us at risk and younger woman are getting it too. it's nothing to put lightly. what happened to me is I had to go to see my gyno for an annul exam when really all I was supposed to get was a refill on my estrogen patches. I dont' have any ovaries or uterus or tubes anymore due to a total hystectomy when i was 45. I\"m now going to be 49 this June. I happened to mention to her my right breast feels dense and painful to some areas of the breast. I had my mammo last fall and it was all clear. my gyno didn't want to take any chances being I'm high risk and sent me for an ultra sound at my local hospital. I never thought I'd get a phone call from my dr.telling me I have the choice of either waiting, or go to see a breast surgeon for an evaluation just to make sure I'm safe. I chose to see the breast surgeon. she sent me for an MRI, Now the radiologist in that hospt. wants to perform another ultra sound herself because something suspicious is showing up on the MRI on my right breast and my dr. said that MRI's can cause false positives and they just want to see if I need to get a biopsy performed. I have a choice as to which dr. will do the biopsy. either the radiologist doctor or my breast surgeon who both perfrom them different. one does it with an MRI guided biopsy, and the other one with an ultra sound guided biopsy. so I\"m pretty confused at this point as to who is my breast dr at this point. I thought i was only seeing one dr. but they must be working together? anyway, my point to you is, any woman is at risk. I felt a change in my breast. it feels thicker and more dense when I examined it. actually I've BEEN feeling that longer than a year now. I jsut never said anything about it being my mammo came out clear. IF I never said anything to my gyno at the time she ck'd me, no one would have ever referred me for an ultra sound which led to the MRi which may lead to having a biopsy and maybe finding a malignancy. it's all freakish how it happened. IF I have a malignancy, the mammor and the ultra sound never saw it. only the MRI did. the report of the MRI says that if the thing winds up being benign, I must have a follow up MRI in 6 months. so it must be something they're very suspicious of. they're not making a big deal out of it and are just matter of factly about it. so I\"m not worried about it. the thing that bothers me the most is waiting for his ultra sound to find out if these two drs want to perform a biopsy. and IF they do, they're also going to test one of the 3 nodes that enlarged also in my breast and along the side of the breast. the things measures 2.5 x 2.8 cm. and in the left breast they say they think are what fibroadenoma's and that the largest one measures 6mm I think I had to have the ultra sound first before I was able to get the MRI. it goes in steps. otherwise the insurance companies give a hard time paying for it. even with family history. it's just the process. I say go through the steps it takes to get an MRI and keep going to a dr. you find who will do it. good luck to you, sincerely, LInda",

      "Content": "I just want to thank you all for sharing your personal story of how your diagnosis was found. It's very important for woman to know this, because otherwise some might not KNOW to do further testing such as an MRI. If I wasn't referred for my MRI, I wouldn't be possibly getting a biopsy because my mammo and ultra sound didn't show anything. I feel something there, but like you said shyloe, some times these modalities don't show certain types of malignancies and not the exact size and shape of it either. NOT till you have the biopsy can they absolutely tell how large it is. I am learning SO MUCH MORE on the health of the breast in this past month than I've ever learned in my entire 48 yrs of life. Thanks to the fine woman like you who are willing to come and share their valued information. It's unfortunate that you have a diagnosis of breast carcinoma and i\"m very sorry for your misfortune. That's why I find it so special of you to come and share your wealth of information with us. I think I\"m better able to learn MORE by hearing what woman and men go through with their own personal experiences than I would learn just by doing a search on breast health. the information you shared with us can save peoples lives. I think an MRI is the best thing they could have come up with to use for seeing changes in the breast. I'd rather have a false positive and wind up getting a breast biopsy than not having the MRI and missing a cancerous lesion, thinking that just a mammo and ultra sound is effective enough. well it's not. Not for high risk woman. thank you. sincerely, Linda",

      "Content": "HI Julie, I just had my 2nd biopsy within a 7 month period and both biopsied are negative for malignancy. the first biopsy was bilateral with ultra sound guided biopsy. an MRI with contrast found the abnormalities. Not a mammogram. not all lesions can be picked up by a mammo which I just learned. this is very scary to me because that's all I used to get before. the only reason I started having ultra sounds with my mammo's and MRI's is becuase i complained to my gyno that my right breast didn't feel normal. it felt swollen. so she sent me to a breast specialtist and the rest follows. I am so greatful they have all these other tests besides mammo's. what birad number did the radiologist give you? I read somewhere that when lesions have blood flow through them can be a sign of malignancy. because this then means that the lesion has vessels running through it. irregular boarders are not good either. In my experience, woman I've talked to seem to think that cysts aren't to be concerned about. My older sister had a cyst that kept getting aspirated by a breast surgeon and eventually it showed up with cancerous cells in it. so they put her on tamoxifen for five years and it has since disappeared thank God. My other sister wasnt' so lucky. she had missed her yearly mammo one year. so when she did go, the mammo came out suspicious. she wound up having a core biopsy ultra sound and it turned out to be a malignancy. she had it in both breasts. they had to do mastectomy rather than lumpectomy because there were no lumps.. it twas something in the ducts. so now I\"M considered high risk, which is why I've been through 2 biopsies in a mattter of 7 months. the fibrosystic thing in my right breast changed, that's why the radiologist upped the birad to 4b SUSPICIOUS FOR MALIGNANCY which was alittle more than the last report 7 months ago. I did NOT expect to get a report like this again so you could imagine my shock. I am SO tired of having these darm, scary biopsies. but I know they're necessary. only a biopsy can tell for sure if it's malignant. I am STILL In pain after a week of having it. this time it was performed with a vuccume type thing and I had to lay face down in an MRI. I dont' know how to make my breast heal any quicker and wonder if all woman have pain still after a week? I pray to God that all goes well with your report. when is your biopsy? Please keep us informed.",

      "Content": "Dear Shisslak, so what they mean by a false positive with MRI's is that it will show something is there? when it's really nothing there? or is it showing a possible malignancy and it winds up being benign? you felt something there when the MRI stated something was there. I feel something there and the MRI is stating something is there too. so what i really have find out now is whether it is a malignancy vs. benign. right? what exactly do they mean by \"false positive\" that there's a malignancy? I was so upset the other day when I went for my follow up ultra sound. I got there at 8 am on the nose. I even had a premoniton that something was going to happen apptn. wise. I even CALLED the hospt. to make SURE I was booked, but no one would pick up the phone in the imaging facility. the operator at the hospt. told me they open at 7 am. but no one picked up. I was going to confirm the apptn. I did find out that I hadn't preregistered, so I wound up doing that when I got there. so when I walked into the dr's office and stood there to give them my name, they said I wasn't on the schedule. my heart dropped to hear that. I FINALLY was going to have the darn test to find out whether we were going to pursue the biopsy. I asked them if an angie was there and they said \"yes\" but that she's not there right now. I told them she was the one that booked the apptn. I KNOW I wouldn't have booked the 7th of May becuase i have a colonscopy booked for the next day. it would be too close for me to book two apptn.'s together. I even highlighted and wrote down the exact time when I initially spoke with angie when we booked the apptn. the secretary went on to tell me that someone cancelled their 9:30 apptn and could I wait an hour and half? I decided to wait and stayed on the grounds and had coffee and read. etc. I went back, got into the robe, went to sit down on the exam table only to have the nice technician tell me the dr. had a biopsy going on and another one right after me, which meant I'd be seen in between patients and that I'd wind up having to wait anywhere between 2 hours or more. I was so upset. I asked her what she thought I shoudl do, becasue I want to maek sure I get the best treatemtn and not have it rushed. so we opted to post pone my apptn and they fit me in at a time where there are no biopsies going to be performed around my time slot which winds up now having me to wait till May 11th. I am very upset about this. I finally was going to have my mind put at ease only to have it blown away again. this waiting is effecting my mental health. I'm finding myself wanting to do research on breast cancer and what other breast cancer patients went through before and after diagnosis. i shouldn't be doing this to myself. but I can't help it. If it's cancer, then I will deal wtih it. All I know is that I'm losing weight quickly, my health has been declining the past year at a fast rate and no one knows what to do about it. My breast surgeon said I must find a doctor to see because I dont' like the one Ive been going to for years. all he does he refer me to specialtists who do nothing for me. I have bone pain all over. a new spot each day, I have no appetite and when I finally do, nothing tastes good to me. I feel weak, can't even walk up a flight of steps and I look terrible. losing too much weight on a woman looks horrible. I am not happy about it in the least. I went through a similar incident before I had my hysteectomy back in 2005. now it's happening again! and this time i\"m worst. the bone pain and aches and pains are horrible. I\"m on pain medicine that my rheumy dr gave me but we have no reason as to why all these sytmptoms are going on. so I'm at the point of a break down. I'm tired of seeing dr.s and just want it done! I am ready for any diagnosis, as long as I get one. thank you for listening to my griping and moping around, but it's hard not to become frustrated at this point. thank you for your reply. good luck with everything too. I only have to go for another MRI if it winds up being benign. it's the ultra sound and biopsy i\"m waiting for. everything is wait, wait, waiting..... sincerely, LInda",

      "Content": "gv2, you say you have a lump by the \"side\" of your breast. I do too. multiple ones. I've had them for about two years now. I even had a breast specialtist surgeon look at it and he said it's just part of the breast tissue. BUT..... my gyno who I had a yearly exam with told me to get an ultra sound performed on my right breast because I mentioned to her it feels strange, dense and painful at times. I'm not cycling anymore because i'm in surgical menopause and on estrogen patches. the older we become, the breast tissue changes. anyway, while i was on the exam table getting the ultra sound performed, she said there was nothing in the breast she could see, then I told her along the far edge of the breast, almost ontop of the ribcage, where a mammorgram would be impossible to scoop up that part of the flesh between the plates on the machine, she finally saw what I was feeling. she then proceeded to take multiple pictures. I recieved a phone call from my gyno two days later and she told me JUST to make sure, I should go and see a surgeon, a breast specialtist surgeon to get an evaluation to see if it should be biopsied. mine are small, less than 1cm. They are lymph nodes, not masses, which is a difference I guess. BUT, enlarged lymph nodes can be enlarged for many reasons. Mostly because of benign reasons. they're only doing their job of filtering out bad stuff. how long have you had the lump there? what does it feel like? is it rubbery and movable? how large is it approx.? do you have a family history of breast and colon cancer in your family which would make you a risk. even though people who've been diagnosed with breast cancer have never had a family history, they still ask if you have any close members with it. I do. both of my sisters have had breast cancer, plus my father died of colon cancer. we have a lumpy, bumpy family history, LOL nothing to joke around about, but I'm trying to make you less nervous. anytime you feel a lump in the breast, they say you should get it examined by your doctor. If I were you, I'd call your gyno to give you an exam. Do you get yearly mammo's? how old are you if I may ask? I really gave a lengthy reply to your message. Hope you get it. sincerely, Linda",

      "Content": "Dear Worried, I am sorry that no one was able to answer your question yet. Maybe someone will able to answer it soon. I myself have no understanding of your diagnosis and would have to do some research on it. They have some outstanding radiology places that explain in detail what all the medical terms are from readings of ultra sounds, mammo's and MRI's. I read what benign lesions, to calcifications to masses and the differences they have. also, avoid, spiculated, and so on. I have two sisters who had breast cancer and I myself had a ultrasound guided biopsy last fall of 2009. It came back negative, but I was told to have a 6 month follow up MRI plus when I have my mammo later it's to be followed up with an ultrasound. I had to have ANOTHER biopsy performed yesterday, but this one was different. It was guided by an MRI and the suspicious lesion biopsied with the vacuume device. when they stuck the needle in to numb it, it hurt and burned. but once it took effect, I felt nothing. Not until a few hours later when the anasthetic wore off did I go through suffering and agony. when the nurse gave me instructions on what to do after I go home and it said no strenuous work for 48 hours following biopsy, like running, or lifting, I remembered her saying this to me when I was writhing in my bed with the ice pack on my swollen breast that felt like a balling ball, compared to my normal b size cup. how on earth would a woman be able to go running after a breast biopsy???? is beyond my understanding. LOL Did you get your results yet or get any answers yet regarding your results? I really wish the best for you and hope that you remain as calm as you can during this very stressfull time. I know. I've been there and can't believe I'm going through this the 2nd time!!! I thought that when I had the biopsy six months ago and when it came back negative that I wouldn't have to worry about this problem again. Boy was I wrong. Please keep us informed.",

      "Content": "My sister had calcifications show up on her mammo and she had to have a biopsy and when she was ready to see her dr after the procedure, he told her everything looked fine and that it didn't look malignant, so you could imagine her shock when she got the phone call at home telling her it was cancer. they found abnormality in the other breast too, the beginning of cancer, so she opted to have both breasts removed. she couldn't have a lumpectomy because there were no lumps, only the calcifications. I would get another opinion if I were your mom. just to be on the safe side. I wish you the best outcome. sincerely, Linda",

      "Content": "Stonebonner, Do you always get ultra sounds yearly rather than an actual mammogram? I'm thinking that maybe they want you to get the mammo beause you have't had your yearly one performed yet? because you had the ultra sound first. usually it's the other way around. the mammo 1st, THEN the ultrasound and even further testing if you're at high risk. the 3rd test they'd order is an MRI with contrast of the breasts to get a clearer picture of the breasts. its' much clearer than a regular mammogram and ultra sound. it can take many many pictures, more than the standard few pictures like a mammo or ultra sound does. did you initially have the ultra sound performed to find out what the 2 lumps are? Aren't they telling you what the 2 lumps are? whether they're masses, or cysts, or lymph nodes???? why isn't your dr. talking to you instead of the nurse? You have questions that aren't being answered and you deserve to have answers given to you. If i were you, I'd give the office a call so that you can rest your anxiety. answers are the best thing to an anxious mind. let us know what happens. good luck sincerely, Linda",

      "Content": "Helenitta, get it ck'd out by your doctor. you dont' always have to have a lump for an abnormality to be there. certain types of abnormalities dont' show up on a mammogram or ultra sound. an MRI is the best modality. Usually the insurance companies make it where you have to have tests done in order. like the cheapest first to see if it picks up something. THEN if that doesn't show something and you're still having pain, then the MRI can be ordered. but keep in mind that an MRI shows lots of false positives. which then puts a woman in a state of fear because the MRI may be showing something that is perfectly harmless and which winds up making a woman have to have a breast biopsy and putting through all that stress when it really winds up being benign. I'd rather have to go through a breast biopsy and find out it's negative than finding out later that you have a malignancy, right? AND you're not too young to get breast cancer. especially if it runs in your family. like mother, sister, grandmother or aunts. now they're finding out that even woman who DONT' have a family history are getting it. My breast surgeon told me on the first visit I had with her that just being a WOMAN puts us at risk these days and they don't really know why? she feels it's the enviroment and the foods we eat that cause it. make an appointment with your gynocolgist for a breast exam. I had pain in my breast too, thought it was nothing and now I have an appointment for both breasts to be biopsied next Thursday. I've never had problems with my breasts before and I'm age 48. But I have a strong family hx of breast ca. both my sisters have had it, so has my aunt and my grandmother died of ovarian cancer, which is another cancer that if runs in the family can put another woman at risk for breast cancer. it's striking now striking woman younger and younger. I dont' mean to scare you and may be absolutely nothing with you, plus the fact you're young and still cycling, which I'm not due to having a total hysterectomy, but the breast changes from cycle to cycle. I remember right before my periods, I'd get pain in my breast. Plus with my first pregnancy, I had severe pain on the sides of my breasts. the cancer society says that breast pain should not be ignored and should be examined. let us know what you decide to do. good luck to you. sincerely, Linda",

      "Content": "Hi JM, There are certain areas on the body where we can feel our lymph nodes. the armpit happens to be one of them, 2nd is the groin area, and the neck, I think. especially if a person is thin. that's what I was told by a doctor anyway. IF you've never felt this lump before, I would see a doctor just to make sure all is ok. If it's a lymph node, it can be enlarged due to inflammatory reasons. you could've nicked yourself while shaving under your arms, etc. Lymph nodes filter out the bad things that enter our body. that's their job. being you have a family history, they'll probably start sending you for mammograms at an earlier age too, like they did to me because of both of my sisters having had breast cancer. It's frightening, I know. You'll have to be diligent in giving yourself monthly breast exams and having your gyno give you breasts exams annually too. This is the best thing you can do to watch for any changes if anything should start to happen. you have to become used to your breasts so that if any changes start to happen in your breast, you'll be right ontop of it. IF you're concerned, I think you should call your doctor and have them give you an exam just to make sure. let us know what happens,. try not to worry hon. it's normal to be able to feel your lymph nodes under your arm pits. to a certain extent that is.

      "Content": "JM, this is fantastic news! I bet you are so relieved it went away. it could've been maybe from shaving? or just the gland itself doing a clean up job like it's supposed to do. I think getting the blood test is a good idea especially being your last one was so long ago. they recommend that when a person reaches a certain age, to have full physicals, which would include the blood work. I hope your testing comes out all clear. good luck and thanks for the update. Linda",

      "Content": "I just had a 2nd breast biopsy within a matter of 7 months apart. 1st one was performed needle biopsy guided with ultra sound, bilat. negative for cancer, but the need to have MRI and ultra sound follow up with closer mammo's was recommened by radiologist at special breast facility. went for my 6 month follow up MRI and got the call that day that I need to set up an apptn for another breast biopsy. My birad went from last time being a 3 to this time a 4B and written right under it, \" SUSPICIOUS FOR MALIGNANCY\". THIS TIME an MRI guided biopsy performed with a vacuum assisted device was used only on the right breast this time. This lesion thing keeps changing. That's why they're keeping a close eye on it. because it changed, the radiologist felt it would be safer to biopsy it. oh, and because of my high risk situaiton being both of my sisters had breast cancer. one was in her 30's at the time, and the other in her late 50's or early 60's. I had the biopsy performed on the 3rd of this month. which it's now the 18th and my breast is STILL Hurting!!! I looked at my breast but didn't touch it after the biopsy. when I did, I was shocked that I felt a rock hard lump the size of a plum. plus the bruise was black, bluish, no yellow or green and the pain and swelling was still there. the nurse told me to come in so the dr. could have a look at it. they said it's a hematoma and that a small percentage of woman get this from the vacuum method and told me to put a warm compress on it and take tylenol and motrin and to go back and see them if it doesn't get better. that was a week and a half ago. this morning I woke up and it hurts just to bend down to do something being my arm grazes the breast. I feel this is ridiculous at this point and can't understand why this is not healing quick enough? is there something I can do or eat or take that would heal this sooner? the older I get, the less tolerance I have to pain. has anyone here had a vacuum biopsy method and going through what I'm going through weeks later?????? If so, is there anything you can recommend I do? any suggestions will be greatly appreciated.",
