      "Content": "Hi Babysister... I'm so sorry you have to go through this worry. I dont think you'll \"not worry\" until you know everything is okay, you're human. My mom has gone through breast cancer twice. Last year, she was also called back from Microcalcifications...and was a BIRAD 4 as well. We were so worried of course due to her history. She went in for a biopsy, and the biopsy came back all \"clear', thank GOD!!! They told her that the biopsy only removed about 90% of the tissue and there was a risk of the other 10% so to be sure, she could have surgery, which she did. She regrets it actually because the surgeon didnt do a good job with her scar....but at the end of the day, that last 10% was also fine. My mom's mammogram was in November, and this stretched out till March of the following year, we were worried sick for 5 months. Just wanted to tell you, that although I know you'll worry, even though there are lots of bad \"signs\"....they dont always turn out to mean anything. They're probably checking because of your history with your mom. I will say a prayer for you, I know the worry is awful, please let us know how you are.... ((((hugs)))) Carsam",

      "Content": "Hi Babysister.... I hope and pray everything goes well with your biopsy. My mom had that done twice....the first time didnt go well, but that was because she wasnt \"frozen\" properly. The second time wasnt as bad. I think it's tougher mentally. But you'll make it, you'll get through it, because you have to. I will say a prayer you get a very positive result and can put this behind you.... Please keep in touch....if you need to talk before and of course to let us know your results...you're not alone!!! Prayers for Babysister Carsam",

      "Content": "Hi there, I would also say to have your doctor examine the lump just to be on the safe side. The pain I think is normal though. My mom had a lumpectomy five years ago and recently had to have a biopsy in the same area. She told the surgeon she has alot of pain there, and he said the inside even though it had been along time was still healing and there was still alot of tenderness there. So I would not think it's abnormal to still feel discomfort. Please see your doctor but dont fret, it may be just normal from the procedure. Wishing you all the best. Caroline",

      "Content": "Hi, My mom has had bc twice.....two lumpectomies, one followed by radiation. Last time was in 2001. Since then she has been fine, except for a few \"scares\". Last year, she had \"calcifications\" and they went in and did a biopsy, came back benign. She just had her mammogram, and they showed up more calcifications, so now she has to go for 'another' biopsy. My question, for anyone who's had bc before, can these calcifications keep showing up, and is there a good chance they can continue to be benign? I know they always have be cautious because of her history, but it doesnt stop me from worrying. Would appreciate some thoughts.... Carsam",

      "Content": "Hi there, For what it's worth, my mom went through the same thing. Lumpectomy, followed by radiation.. she started on Arimidex but her body did not handle well so she decided the radiation was enough. She got through the sessions. They were not painful, just stressful and made her very tired. 6 years later and she has tremendous pain in her rib area.....I am not saying that to deter you, it is probably the right thing to do, to take every precaution. There is no easy answer, you just dont want to do any of it. But I just wanted to share that it is true, there are lasting side effects. My mom only agreed to it because it was the second time she had breast cancer. We were told that the chance for reoccurence \"without\" radiation was 30-40%, and with it, was reduced to 10% so she decided to go ahead with it. Good luck with your decision, I know it's a tough one....yes, she had pain in her ribs but if it has prevented anything from coming back, it's worth it. Unfortunately we'll never know that....

      "Content": "Hi Shogirl, Just wanted to give you another perspective..... Firstly, I completely agree with you that mammograms are crucial in finding lumps and also agree with cancer treatment, whether its radiation or chemo. I can understand and respect your stance and reaction to the previous poster. But I wanted to say that there are some of us out there that may not have been told \"we have cancer\" but that does not mean we know nothing about it. In the last 6 years, my mom was diagnosed with a reoccurence of breast cancer and underwent surgery and radiation. My uncle was diagnosed with bowel cancer and later passed away. Another uncle at the same time was diagnosed with a brain tumor, had surgery, radation and then passed away. Aunt in New Zealand had lung cancer, and is doing okay today. Best friend diagnosed two years ago with Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma, underwent chemo and radiation and is living a healthy life. There are more stories but I'll stop there. I believe treatment was helpful to all of them and to those that did not have it, it was because it was caught too late. So as I said, I completely agree with you that treatment is necessary. But as a family member, I have been \"bombarded\" with all these types of cancers in my family in a few short years, so I know ridiculously more about it than I ever wanted to. I have spent hundreds and thousands of hours researching this illness, been to every doctors appointments, treatment. I just wanted to say as \"one\" person, just because I have not been told I have \"cancer\" does not mean I can not have an opinion on the subject. That's all I wanted to say and I mean no disrespect whatsoever. It's a horrible horrible illness and I see the fear on my mom's face every time she's waiting for results. For sure I dont know that fear but I try my best to at least understand the options available to her so I can help her through things. It is by no means \"easy for me to say what she should do or not do\"....every decision she makes is crucial to her health. Nothing about this is easy for anyone, including those of us who love people with cancer. Regards, Carsam",
