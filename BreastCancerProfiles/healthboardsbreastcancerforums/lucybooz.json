      "Content": "i'm so sorry your news got turned around. i so hope things go well for you, but i think we \"breast problem people\" are doomed to live life worrying and wondering. i just turned 65 last november. i often thought of how lucky i've been never having to deal with any major medical issues. i guess it's now my turn to deal!!!!! i'm waiting today for the surgeon to call with the path report. i am convinced that i will hear the words malignant. the radiologist who first read my ultrasound told me he was 60% sure of a malignancy, and the surgeon who did the biopsy yesterday said he would say \"more than 60%\". i know in my heart i have breast cancer - can't believe i'm saying this. 2 week ago life was so good. amazing what can happen in 2 weeks. both the radiologist and the surgeon have been telling me this is extremely small (not even 1/4\") so my recovery chances are excellent (doesn't really have me feeling all fuzzy and happy right now). the surgeon has mentioned that the next step will be a lumpectomy. already i'm wondering if i go to sleep for the lumpectomy will i wake up having had to have a mastectomy!!!!! they keep saying it's so good i got an annual mammogram - this couldn't be felt by either my gynecologist (i just had my annual checkup last month) nor the surgeon, which i've done faithfully as long as i can remember. this is true - EVERY woman needs to have this done - no excuses!!!!!!! i feel like you, i only want to talk to someone who has my problem or is dealing with the waiting and wondering. that's why i felt so badly that noone ever replied to either of my posts (\"the news is numbing\" is the last one i posted). my husband has been by my side but i know he's worried sick, and i have a son (who is an alcoholic doing well now so i don't want to rock the boat there), and a daughter who lives in PA (i live in GA). you can't really talk about your own mortality issues with your daughter!!!!! i know i'm jumping the gun but my mind has been racing. god bless lucy",

      "Content": "i know what you are going through. i'm so glad that folks chatted with you about your problem. i posted twice and got no replies. i wanted so badly to have someone tell me something...anything. i'm in the same boat, so to speak, as you (being told there is a question about the findings). i had an abnormal mammo 2 weeks ago, and have since had an ultrasound and just today had my biopsy. unbelievable what can transpire in 2 short weeks. it can blow your mind, and the not knowing is pure torture. i told the doctor it seems unreal to feel so good and have this looming in your mind. i was told i had a 60%+ that my finding will be malignant - something about the shape of it. they are telling me that it is so totally small that they are sure it was caught in time (it couldn't be felt by anyone - just showed up on the mammo and then ultrasound). i find myself reading on-line (should never do that) and i'm realizing that even with a lumpectomy (which is what the surgeon said will be done if the path report is positive), this will not go away like a common cold. i don't know how anyone can go thru this without being scared to death. it's horrible to say but it is somewhat of a comfort to know you are absolutely not alone with this horrible disease - so many of us are infected with it. you will be in my prayers and i will continue to follow your posts, hoping you get GOOD NEWS and that all goes well for you. lucy",
