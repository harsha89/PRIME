      "Content": "On a mammogram, atypical ductal hyperplasia shows up as a small deposit around the milk duct. A doctor will usually ask to take a biopsy of the area to confirm that the growth is atypical ductal hyperplasia, to eliminate causes such as a malignant tumor. When the biopsy confirms that the patient has atypical ductal hyperplasia, the doctor may discuss a number of options with the patient. The simplest option is to leave the site alone. Because this condition is not cancerous, it does not require treatment. However, doctors will usually recommend that their patients monitor their breasts carefully during monthly breast self exams, and patients may be encouraged to have clinical breast exams and mammograms on a more regular basis. By remaining vigilant, patient and physician can catch the signs of breast cancer early, if it emerges. Some women choose to take prophylactic drugs if they develop atypical ductal hyperplasia, especially if their family members have a history of cancer. These drugs can help reduce the risk of breast cancer. More radically, a woman may opt for a preventative mastectomy. This is not a choice to be undertaken lightly, and it is generally only considered when a woman has a substantial family history of breast cancer along with other risk factors which elevate the probability of developing breast cancer. By performing regular breast self exams and receiving recommend healthcare screening such as mammograms, women can identify atypical ductal hyperplasia and other health conditions early and make proactive choices about their health. blessings, Sue",

      "Content": "I have occasional bloody discharge too, and my breast surgeon also said it was a papilloma (and benign in nature). I've never had a poor mammogram and over the years I will get the discharge maybe every eight months or so. Certainly get your discharge checked out, but happily mine has a happy ending.",

      "Content": "This offers some great information. Also, like you ladies, I only notice the breast fluid first thing in the morning, especially if I've been sleeping on my tummy for the night. What is an Intraductal Papilloma?: An intraductal papilloma is a tiny wart-like growth in breast tissue that sometimes punctures a duct. These benign tumors are composed of fibrous tissue and blood vessels. Intraductal papillomas grow inside your breast's milk ducts, and can cause benign nipple discharge. What do Intraductal Papillomas Feel Like?: If you have just one intraductal papilloma, and it is near or just beside a nipple, it may feel like a small lump. Solitary intraductal papillomas usually occur in the large milk ducts near your nipple. When one of these breaks a duct, it can cause a little clear or bloody nipple discharge, which is usually not worrisome. If you have multiple papillomas, they usually occur deeper inside your breast, and can't easily be felt. A group of papillomas like this won't cause nipple discharge. Getting a Clear Diagnosis: If you find a small lump quite near your nipple and see some discharge, keep an eye on it. If it doesn't grow, and the discharge ceases, chances are it is benign. See your doctor or nurse practitioner for a clinical breast exam, or if you want to have the fluid tested. If the lump is large enough for you to easily feel it, you may want to have a needle biopsy done, and the tissue sample examined. You may also consider having the lump imaged, a technique called a ductogram.",
