    "Content": "Hello, I am a 43 yr old female. Yesterday, on the way home from work, my left nipple started itching EXTREMELY bad! No matter how much I scratched it would not go away. In October I saw my PCP about a swollen lymph node under my left armpit. She said it was probably an infection, she gave me antibiotics and told me if it did not go away to call her back. I did not think anything about it since I do not have breast cancer in my family. I came home and looked up reasons for an itchy nipple that is painful and came up with Paget disease. I started thinking about the lymph node then and wondered. I need to go see a GYN dr but I start a new job tomorrow and have to wait 30 days for medical benefits. I would like to know how worried I should be. I had a mammogram in the summer of 2012 and it was negative but I also have had a breast reduction several years ago. My nipple is not inverted but it is flat with the areola. I know this maybe too much information but I am a little concerned. I do not have the best luck. I am curious to find out if it could be Paget's disease. Thank you for your time.",
