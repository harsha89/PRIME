    "Content": "I was diagnosed with a small 2mm area of dcis 5 months ago and had it excised - I went to several doctors, oncologists, radiation therapists who said that nothing further needed to be done. One said they would recommend prophylactic radiation, however when I went to the radiation therapists, they said it was unnecessary. I have no family history. Have regular yearly mammos since 35, because I have always been worried about this disease, always. I am 42 with 4 children I am scheduled for a bilateral simple mastectomy in three weeks. As my surgery date approaches I am scared to do it and scared not to. Has anyone been through this surgery and can let me know what I can expect? I am also scheduled for a saline type expander during the same surgery, the plastic surgeon will be there as well. Has anyone had experience with this type of expander, any advice knowledge would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!",
