    "Content": "i am 32 years old. i have had cysts in my breasts for a good 10 years or so. once in a while, they flare up, but in a day or two, all is fine. so, i am familiar with breast cyst pain, the soreness feeling. ok, for about a month or so, my left breast has been hurting...(not the soreness feeling that is normally felt with cyst pain) it doesnt hurt to press on the breast anywhere...but its a constant hurt, makes me want to rip it off! its an achy, painful hurt...not sharp pains, or soreness..i dont know how else to describe it. the nipple area sometimes feels full, sometimes feels bruised, not to the touch..but when lifting my arm or something...like maybe a pulled muscle type feeling. (only way i know how to describe the feeling) anyhow, i went for my first mammogram friday, for this very reason (i told them while making the appt that my left breast hurt)...knowing i had cysts, i asked the technician if she could also do an ultrasound...and she told me that they only do ultrasounds if they see something suspicious. well, they done 2 x-rays on the right breast, and all together 4 on the left..making me think they saw something....then she came back and said they would be doing the ultrasound. I am puzzled..because of course, they wouldnt tell me anything,....did they do the extra x-rays because they seen something, or as a precaution because of my complaints??...did they do the ultrasound just to be certain that there was nothing...since i am complaining with it??? i just dont know what to think. i am scared of them telling me that its something bad...but then again....i have no other symptoms of breast cancer...no discharge, no size change...nothing but the pain and the cysts. the radiologist was supposed to read my reports that same day, and told me that they would send the reports to my family dr...and that the family dr would be the one to tell me the results...that i should hear something by tuesday. well, i have survived the wait this long....but tuesday seems so far away....to be so near...and this is really driving me out of my mind. the only history of breast cancer in my family is....my first cousin on my moms side....found after age 50....was cured after radiation and chemo....but just found out last week that she has cancer of the liver. also, my aunt on my dads side had breast cancer late last year...she is in her 60's. can anyone tell me if this sounds like possible cancer or not??",
