    "Content": "Hello, I am hoping for advice from others that have had a similar situation. I am 36 and starting having regular mammograms last year (I had a baseline when I was 30). My mother was diagnosed at age 45 (and probably had the tumor for a number of years). My doctor said I should starting getting regular mammograms when I was 10 years younger than that. This year I had a call back and they did extra mammograms and an ultrasound. They found a \"cluster of cysts\" and gave me the option to get a needle biopsy or wait 6 months for another mammogram and look for changes. The radiologist said she wasn't too concerned because breast cancer is such a slow growing cancer for most people (not too sure about that one). Anyway, since I am an obsessive worrier, I scheduled the biopsy for this Thursday. Should I reconsider this? I still have to meet my deductible and insurance is estimating out of pocket costs around $1,700. I don't feel good about either option at this point. Thanks for any advice!",
