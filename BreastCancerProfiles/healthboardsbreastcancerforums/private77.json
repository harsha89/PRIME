Hope that there is a cure for all types of cancer really soon. It seems they can go to the moon and to mars and there is nothing to do for this horrible disease that we have to go through in terrible pain at times.",

      "Content": "I would definitely see a breast surgeon. If you go for an ultrasound they can tell right away if it is a cyst. If it is they will do an aspiration on it where they draw out the fluid. Please do not wait to do this. Hope everything goes well for you. I have had breast cancer and so far have had to go for mammograms and ultrasounds every 6 months. I have had cysts and they have done the aspiration. Then they send out the fluid to the lab to make sure everything is okay.",
