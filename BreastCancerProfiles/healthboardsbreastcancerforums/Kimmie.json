      "Content": "OK, so I have an appt. next week for an incisional biopsy. The MRI was negative for anything cancerouse, but cannot rule it out completely. The bruise is still there, sometimes feels itchy and sore, but other times I forget about it. No additional symptoms (IE breast not hot or inflamed;no discharge, no inversion of nipple..) so far **KNOCK WOOD** No one has responded to this yet, but I will still get back on here with the results from my biopsy..just in case someone like me is looking for answers in the future",

Let me know what you find out if you remember! Good luck",

Good luck, sweetie! Thanks, Nibbsie! I have found in the past with family members that prayer does work. This bruising really has me worried, I keep expecting to wake up with all of the other symptoms of IBC any morning! Can't believe I am actually looking forward to the biopsy just so I can bet some answers! Thanks again, you are an angel",

      "Content": "Months ago I noticed a bruise on the side of my right breast, almost in the armpit area. I assumed it was from the underwire bra I was wearing, as it did irritate the skin in that area. I quit wearing it. The bruise never went away, just faded. Now, about 3 weeks ago it seemed to get worse, I noticed an odd, yellowish-brown bruised area across the top of the breast, and my breast was itchy a lot. Also, the tissue under the bruised areas feels dense, not like a lump, just very dense. I went to my OBGYN, who referred me to a general surgeon, who then referred me for an MRI, since he had no clue what this was. I did ask about Inflammatory Breast Cancer, but he didn't seem to think this looked like it, since there is not any red, imflamed tissue, just the bruising. I just talked to the surgeon, and all they would tell me was that the MRI did not show any signs of cancer, not to worry. But they still suggested I go in for my follow up appt. on Monday (5 days from now) and they would go over the report with me then. If anyone has had any experience with something like this, PLEASE fill me in. I am still VERY concerned about the Inflammatory Breast Cancer. I will come back on her after my follow-up and post what I found out. Hopefully, it will be GOOD news.",

I never really noticed it until tonight, when the pain got worse. I looked up information on breast cancer and stuff and found your post. Please, if you find out anything, let me know! Don't panic just yet! It really could be just from the bra irritating that area. If there isn't a lump there that you can feel, it probably isn't anything to worry about just yet. Switch to a comfortable bra for a few days and see if it gets better. Mine didn't, and then I started getting the bruising across the top of the breast. That's when I went in to see my Dr. about it. Remember, Inflammatory Breast Cancer is VERY rare, and you will generally get some pretty hard to ignore symptoms (breast should get hard and inflammed, possible oozing from the nipple area...etc). The only thing that had me worried was the bruising not going away for months and then spreading, and the thickening of the breast tissue in the bruise area. I haven't had any of the other symptoms. I am expecting results from my biopsy any day now. By the way, the biopsy wasn't bad at all. I was very nervouse and it was not bad at all. They knocked me out for it (general anesthesia) and I was only a little sore for a few days..and they took TWO biopsies, one from the side of the breast and one from under the armpit. Still not bad. I will post the results when I get them...not too worried at this point, just concerned Don't worry yourself too much. Just keep an eye on the area, most likely it will clear up on it's own. If not, I would see a Doctor. There are LOTS of things it could be besides cancer. Check back in and let me know how you are doing, ok?",
