      "Content": "March 3rd I had a mammogram done. March 10th I was contacted that more views and an ultrasound were required. March 31st I had them done. Within a half-hour, my Gyn was being contacted that there was a problem. The problem was not with the cysts that were readily visible and have a clear margin. The report stated that an \"incidental finding\" was that of a microlobuated 9mm mass in the right breast at about 10 o'clock. Any one else have this scenario and everything was okay? All the research I've done online indicates that the microlobulated mass is usually a good indication of cancer. Btw, my Mother had b/c about five years ago. She is a third generation cancer victim, although the first breast cancer one. All other relatives but one died from their cancer. Her generation is also the first to not have had any one die from their cancer. Without that ultrasound we wouldn't have known it was there for another year. It was rather uncomfortable in that area when the test was being done. Thanks, Sal",

      "Content": "Still waiting to find out the biopsy results. It was done on Tuesday this past week and the appointment to review the results is set for this coming Wednesday. It REALLY irks me that the hospital said the Dr would have the results in 2-3 days. When I scheduled the appointment and it was set for over a week after the biopsy, I questioned that. I was told that usually even then they still don't have the results and have to call for it. Hmmmmm Sal",

      "Content": "Thanks! That's pretty much what I've been finding myself. Just wanted to get some other perspectives. My biopsy is scheduled for the 20th. The only ones that get in sooner are those that have had b/c previously or have large masses, etc. Fwiw, my Birad was a 4 and the radiologist was calling my Dr within approximately 1/2 hour upon my departure from the ultrasound. I was scheduled to see a surgeon the next day. Sure seems bizarre to be placed on such a rushed track to have to wait for so long for the biopsy. St. Joseph Womens Hospital Breast Center here in Tampa has a \"Fast Track\". I was placed on that soon as the BIRAD was known. Toodles, Sally",

      "Content": "Had a breast biopsy done at the local VA hospital yesterday. I'm to call late next week for results, unless I hear from them sooner. Ultrasound report after screening and diagnostic mammaograms - Any input is appreciated. I would mention that Mother had b/c in 1999 at about age 62/63, dcis and lcis, and is a survivor. real-time ultrasound of the left breast demonstrates hypoechoic spiculated mass at the 9 o'clock position, 3-4cm from the nipple with posterior acoustic shadowing and measuring approx 12.1 x 10.6 x 5.6 mm. Some of the posterior border is poorly defined. This finding correlates in size, appearance and distance from the nipple with the mammogram findings. There are additional probable benign findings. At 6 o'clock, 3-4cm from the nipple there is 2.3 x 1.9 x 22m and a 5.0 x 1.4 x 5.1 cm probable cysts with internal echoes. At 7:30 o'clock, 4-5cm from the nipple there is 1.3 x 1.9 x 2.1 mm cyst with questionable internal echoes. At 12-12:30 o'clock, there is slightly hyperechoic nodule with cystic components, probably representing a complex cyst, measuring 5.7 x 3.2 x 5.8 mm. Bi-Rads raing 4 - suspicious abnormality, biopsy of 9 o'clock mass should be considered. Thanks! Sally",
