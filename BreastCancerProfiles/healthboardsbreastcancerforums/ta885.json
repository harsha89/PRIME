    "Content": "I was diagnosed with triple negative breast cancer recently. I've already had a lumpectomy. The cancer was 1 cm, stage 1, but grade 3, and was triple negative. After surgery, the margins were clear and there was no lymph node involvement. My oncologist suggested the less toxic of the chemos for this which is Taxotere, Cytocin, every 21 days for 12 weeks. He said I could choose the more dense type of chemo which he would agree to and said if I went to Sloan Kettering this is what they would give me which is 16 weeks every 2 weeks, cytocin, adrea, taxol. I am having trouble deciding. He said there is single digit difference in the chance of recurrence. Does anyone have a suggestion? Lynne",
