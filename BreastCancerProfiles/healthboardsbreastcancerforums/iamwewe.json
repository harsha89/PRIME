    "Content": "I am a two year colon cancer survivor and after my annual mammo, diagnostic mammo and breast ultrasound it is determined that i need a needle biopsy for what is believed to be a adenofibroma. Has anyone had a breast cancer diagnosis from what was thought to be an adenofibroma? I'm numb from the news, and don't have my ultrasound driven biopsy for another week. I'd like to find info/stats as to how often an adenofibroma is cancer or not, so experienced people are a big help I look forward to hearing from you.",
