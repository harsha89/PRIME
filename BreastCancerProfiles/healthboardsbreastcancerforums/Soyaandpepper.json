      "Content": "uptownJ: Thanks for all the support! I read quite a bit of your opinions in this thread. I have in reality one (1) girlfriend in total and she's younger than me, she's 29 and really don't have much to say about it except that everything is going to be all right. That's why I joined this group. Its nice to talk to women who went through and going through the same thing as me. I found a lump on my right breast about 5 weeks ago, not from self breast exam but just by passing my hand over my breast (its that obvious). I also had another one on my left breast for a few years now from when I was in my 20s', that one I went to the ob/gyn at that time checked it and told me its nothing to worry about so I left it and its been there for like 5 years. So after I found the new one on the right, I went to my doctor ( Family doctor), and he sent me to do an ultrasound right away. The result came back that the old one is a fibroadenoma but the new one has some mild irregularities around the edges so he referred me to a surgeon and the rest is the story you read in the thread. I'm still waiting on the results and I feel like I'm really in limbo. Its just the not knowing part that's killing me right now and then the possibilities of it being cancer is really mind blowing.",

      "Content": "Harmoney: I don't know what that Surgeon was thinking about! He's just a general Surgeon and not a breast surgeon so my guess is that the open biopsy was more money for him to make. Since in my country they are private doctors. I'm not from the US, I'm Trinidad and Tobago if you guys know where that is. It's an island in the Caribbean. Our government health care is 3rd world to say the least and we have to pay out of our pocket or if we have health insurance. Well, my results came back and it is CANCER. Bummer!!!! I found out last week and the news shocked me to the core, but having time to cry and all of that, I'm dealing with it now. I don't want this cancer to define me, its what I have not what I am. I'm going to beat it.",

I'm praying and keeping my fingers cross for you too. But I'm a little confused, you said that you're still waiting for results of your biopsy right? Is it on both breast or just the left one? And how come you're already meeting with a surgeon to do lumpectomy already and you don't know if your result of the biopsy? And also, are you saying that they're doing an open biopsy on your right breast or just opening your breast to see what's in there?",

      "Content": "Hi Angelalovew: I guess you didn't see one of the posts in this thread that I found out I have BC. Sorry if I scared you with my results since I saw that you had yours done and getting back the results on May 3rd but I'm praying that its B9 for you. Please keep me posted as to your results. I find that you're made to wait really long for yours, how are you doing with the wait? I find that the most important thing is to keep yourself busy and do what you normally do like I go to work and the gym as normal. With the soreness, I didn't feel anything much actually. I was back to doing weights at the gym the next day after the biopsy. I just stayed away from doing chest exercises. Have you called the DR office and tell them about your soreness and being swollen? I didn't have anything like that. You had a core biopsy right? On one breast? I had on both breasts. I think you should call the office and tell them and see what they say. To txjam: Thank you so much for the info and I will check out that book you mentioned for sure. Its so great to actually talk to other women who went through this and come out the other end and willing to talk about their most intimate thing to others on this site. Thanks again!!!!! I'll keep you guys posted. I think I'm going with the Bilateral Mastectomy with immediate reconstruction. Don't want to look over my shoulders for the rest of my life and wonder and do MRI and mammogram every year for the rest of my life either.",

      "Content": "To KellyMT: Hope that you get your results by now and its good news! Of course if the result came back that you have BC then they will do the surgery but you need to do some research on your own and see what's the best option if it turns out that it really is BC. I just have my app with my doctor and he's telling me a lot of options I have. Its good that the'er concern about you and that they're not just waiting around but you also don't want to do this lumpectomy and then finds out that your margins are not cleared and have to go back in to remove more tissue or even a mastectomy. Go to the app and see what the doctor have to say on the 26th, by then you would know for sure whether you have BC or not but please do your own research. I went on the net and read all about the different types of BC and staging and grading of cancer even before my biopsy was done. I know a lot of people say don't google anything cause it'll drive you crazy, I agree that you shouldn't go and assume you have everything but its good to go on the reputable sites and read and educate yourself about it. Please let me know how things went. Will be thing about you. I found out that I have stage 1, grade 2 Invasive Ductal Carcinoma.",

      "Content": "Thanks txjam for your support! So you had chemo before your mastectomy and then Radiation? Wow that's a lot of stuff to take in. I'm really sorry you had to go through all of that. I was told that when you have mastectomy, you don't need radiation. How come you had it? I hope you don't mind me asking but was just wondering and want to find out as much as possible, and how long was your journey to now? How many rounds of chemo? My doctor want to operate with in the next 10 days and I still have to decide on the options I have. Thanks a million!",

      "Content": "Hi, I'm new to the group and had just had a core needle biopsy done on the 4/4/12. Still waiting on results and joined to actual seek support and comfort during this long waiting period for results. I went with a second opinion after the first surgeon suggested that an open biopsy was the only option for me. He didn't even discuss with me about needle biopsy until I asked about it. He said then that I'm not a good candidate for a needle biopsy. SO I left his office and found another doctor who is a breast specialist and he did a core needle biopsy on both breasts. I think you should really seek a second and a third opinion if needed before you make your choice. Its a big decision, and since I'm only 34 years old, I need to know all there is to know before you open me up and take a big chunk of my tissue from my breast. So please be inform about all your options before making an educated decision, I know I did! The wait for the result is killing me!",
