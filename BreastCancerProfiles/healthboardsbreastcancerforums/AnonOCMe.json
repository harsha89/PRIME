    "Content": "Could diphenhydramine (benadryl) cause intraductal papilloma or periductal mastitis? Has anyone had a similar experience to this? In October of 2011, I began taking Benadryl for my chronic insomnia. After over a year of trying to treat it naturally with coffea cruda and valerian root, the natural remedies became less effective so I broke down and started taking benadryl. By December, I was taking up to 5 benadryl gel tabs per night in order to sleep. Around Christmas I noticed a small painful lump under the nipple on my left breast. The previous evening, one of my cats stepped directly on it which is always painful anyway. So the next day I had just gotten out of the shower and my arm brushed over my nipple causing a very painful stinging sensation. Upon further palpation, I found a lump. Chalking it up to probable swelling from the stomping my nipple took the night before, I thought nothing of it. The next night, my nipple began to itch incessantly. The day after that, swelling. The day after, more swelling and pain. About 5 days went by since the initial discovery and finally I broke down and reluctantly went to the Doctor. I say reluctantly because I didn't want to hear the cancer word especially since I was sure it was just an infection. Years ago I had my nipple pierced but I haven't worn any rings in them for over a decade and they are almost completely closed. I just assumed something got into the small opening and caused the infection. Of course, when I went in for medical evaluation, the Doctor brought up that awful \"C\" word and after a little arguing with her about sonograms and stuff, I convinced her to just give me antibiotics on the condition that if the infection did not go away in two days I would come back for further tests. After two days of cephalexin, the lump began to decrease in size and the pain subsided. After ten days, it was nearly gone except for a hard lump the size of a pea. I thought it was over but two weeks later it came back. My breasts always swell right before my period and the lump was agitated again. This time the inflammation was much larger. Not wanting to go through the cancer word and arguing with my Doctor, I ignored it, thinking it would just go away when my period was over. It did, but not completely. The lump shrunk down to about the size of a marble. The next month, right before my period, it flared up even larger and was incredibly painful with the sensation moving to my left arm to my elbow and into my back. Again, I ignored it but this time I was fearful. After my period, the flare up subsided and went back to down to a size slightly larger than a marble. The next month, it flared up again. This time it was even larger than the last flare up but less painful. I began to suspect the benadryl was causing this to happen since I had no problems before I started taking it. I stopped completely and within a week, the lump shrunk to the size of a pea. Another week went by and it was down to half the size of a pea. That brings us up to date. No flare up before my period this time which started last night. I have looked all over the web trying to find information about intraductal papillomas, periductal mastitis, and breast abscesses and their relationship to or being caused by diphenhydramine. The only things I found are related to breast feeding. I have no kids and have never breast fed in my life. I am 37 years old. I've been pregnant twice...as recently as 2010 but was unable to carry full terms on either pregnancy. Both resulted in miscarriages. Has anyone out there had similar problems related to diphenhydramine? Are there any real medical professionals that have an opinion or have seen a case like this? Any input would be highly appreciated. Note:Please refrain from trolling or causing alarm by saying things like \"definitely sounds like cancer\" or \"you're stupid for ignoring it\". Please have some tact. My reaction was a perfectly normal psychological reaction so spare me the lectures. Also, amateur Doctors are not appreciated here. I only want to know if anyone else has had a similar experience or I would like the opinion of someone who has finished their medical training and has practiced in the field. Nurses, EMT's, Doctors, Physician's Assistants are welcome. Thank you.",
