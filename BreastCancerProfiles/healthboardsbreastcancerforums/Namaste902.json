      "Content": "I had both done due to a lump in my left breast and the mamogram NEVER picked up the cyst. I remember the radiologist even wanting extra pictures even though she was done just to make sure and in the additional pictures it still never picked up the cyst. I guess that is my Gyne, when she order the test it was a stat ultrasound and they only did the mammogram because they did not have one as a base line for me since I was 41 at the time. Well, radiologist came in and talked to me and told he was unable to see anything in my left breast but that the one thing that would for sure pick up what is in that breast would be the ultrasound. Sure enough there it was. I seriously had the best radiologist. Even after the ultrasound tech did my exam and took the pictures, he came in and also did my ultrasound to confirm it to me that it was just a fluid filled cyst. He literally took the time and sat there and should on the screen showing me the cyst and he was able to see it was water filled because it was literally jet black. It is now gone and actually went away the following month. I prayed everyday that it was nothing.",

      "Content": "I just had my yearly Gyne appt today. I have a mammogram and ultrasound schedule for Monday. She wants to be safe regarding the cyst in my left breast. At the time I had my mammogram, it never picked up the the cyst but the ultrasound did. The radiologist did the ultrasound himself as well and told me I had 4 water filled cyst in my left breast. So, I'm having both done on Monday to make sure it's nothing else because there still there. They are still there and painful somewhat and annoying.",
