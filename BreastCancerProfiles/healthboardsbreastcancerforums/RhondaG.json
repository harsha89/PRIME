    "Content": "I was diagnosed 4 years ago at the age of 35 with Stage 2 Breast Cancer. I had 2/10 positive lymph nodes and estrogen/progesterone receptive cancer. I underwent 6 months of chemo (4 cycles of Adriamycin/Cytoxin and 4 cycles of Taxol) followed by 7 weeks of radiation. I am in my last year of tamoxifen therapy. I never regained my strength and have continued to have joint and muscle pain. Over a year ago, I began having TMJ problems and, due to an insightful oral surgeon and a wonderful internal medicine doctor, it has been discovered that I have systemic lupus! Since SLE is an auto-immune disorder and chemotherapy tends to destroy the immune system, I wonder which came first: the lupus or the cancer. Does anyone out there also have systemic lupus? ------------------ Rhonda Jeremiah 29:11 \"For I know the plans I have for you, declares the Lord, plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.\"",
