    "Content": "I also agree, i would get more testing done now. i had calk's a few years ago, but since they were in the veins, they did not worry. my pcp doc told me to go see the surgeon anyway for his opinion, he agreed, nothing to worry about. this year, more calk's showed up, but this time not in the veins or vessels. need a biopsy. I had the stero-one done and got the results the next day. my doc called to tell me i had ADH (Atypical Dudctal Hyperplasia) and needed surgery to be sure there was no cancer. so a month later, i had surgery. thankfully, no cancer........ be safe, go for more testing now. and good luck",
