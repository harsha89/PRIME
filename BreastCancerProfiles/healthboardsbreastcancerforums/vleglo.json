      "Content": "I had a mastectomy and removal of several lymph nodes in 2004. This was followed with radiation (25 sessions) and chemotherapy (4 sessions). During the last year and a half, my left arm started swelling and felt very uncomfortable. It is worse during summer and when I am very active, like gardening. I was told it is lymphodemia and received some massage and pressure bandages. Will it go away? What else can be done? Hope someone can help! Thanks",
