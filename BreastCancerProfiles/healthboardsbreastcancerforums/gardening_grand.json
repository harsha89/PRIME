I had a wire guided biopsy ,doctor said he probably got it all out .He didn't ! then a lumpectomy on june 10, went to oncologist hoping to start rads and he says it still is not good enough only 1 cm clean margins.so I also am leaning towards mast with reconstuctive surgery at the same time.good luck and keep us posted as to how you are doing.(((HUGS))) Robin",

Best of luck to you and your wife, hope everything comes out good.Robin",

One time I did have a red spot on the side of my breast.It was kind of like a boil.It was red ,Then started draining later and just went away.My breast have never been the same size right one always bigger. when I went for my mammo I was just going for routine check as I did not feel any lump.I was diagnosed with DCIS. which is early stage cancer.So definitely get this checked out .Best of luck to you .Hope everything comes out clean.Robin",

Good luck ,Robin",

The hardest part for me was staying compressed in the mammo machine while they checked xrays several times . Keep us updated on how you are doing .Robin",
