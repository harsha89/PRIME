    "Content": "So I have had painful breasts for couple months now! And the pain would go in my armpits. My left breast hurts all the time and now I noticed a very small painful moveable lump, size of a pencil eraser. I really have too dig around too find it. I have very small breasts. Maybe a cyst? Or gland? But it hurts! Sometimes it will make my breast burn. I had a mammogram and it was fine. So what is this in feeling? Why the pain!? Anyone???",
