    "Content": "Hi there, I was diagnosed with a breast harmatoma myself about 5 years ago and was faced with the same issue. I had a mamogram and tissue was taken to test for malignancy and was told it was benign but was advised that as they can sometimes change later in life due to hormonal changes I should have it removed just in case. So I had the operation and almost immediately (approx 4 months later) a new lump formed where the old one used to be as well as another new one in a different location. This was picked up by my consultant during a post op examination and i had to go through all the tests again. The results came back to confirm that these were also benign but this time I decided didnt want to go through the operation yet again if my body was going to keep producing them. So far I haven't had any cause for concern, the harmatomas are still there but havent increased in size or anything so I would advise your sister not to worry unduly. If her consultant isn't too worried and is offering her the choice then it may be worthwhile just keeping and eye on them with regular checkups. Dependant on her age, because they are effected by hormonal changes, it may however be worthwhile having the op so she doesnt need to worry about them any further. I hope this helps!",
