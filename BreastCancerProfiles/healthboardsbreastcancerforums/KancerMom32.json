After examining me she said normally they are not allowed to refer someone of my age, I would have to wait a month and if it was still there go bk and get refered then. However she said in my case she wanted to do an urgent referal right away! Now I'm really anxious! I know I'm young so the odds r in my favor, but I'm really worried now! Any other young women had lumps on here? I hope you get checked out really quick!",
