    "Content": "My partner had the same discharge. Last week she began having severe headaches. They did the catscan, and showed nothing. The pain hasn't went away but its numbed with meds. The day before she had a mamogram and this morning we've received the dreaded call. Ultrasound and blood work is being scheduled. She has pagets diease a rare form of breast cancer. We are unsure of stages its in, and how invasive its become. Needless to say our lives are about to change. Her son in law recently survived a rare form of throat cancer, so we're being very optimistic. She's only 45 and the discharge had come and gone this past few months. I think the headaches contributed to its finding.",
