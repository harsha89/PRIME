    "Content": "Hi, hope someone has some insight on this, I had a mammogram that showed a 2.6 cm nodule on my right breast, I was called back for a second mammogram which showed the same thing, I had an ultrasound right after and it didn't show anything, the tech had to call in the doctor to see for herself, now I've been referred for an MRI! I am 37 years old and extremely worried, anyone out there with similar results, thanx",
