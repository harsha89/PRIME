      "Content": "Butterfly, Yes, sometimes I sweat so badly at night my hair is even wet. However, this does not happen on a regular basis. Plus we totally switched climates. I know this sounds strange but we moved from a very cold climate (Minnesota) to a much warmer climate (New Mexico). I figured I was just acclimatingto the weather. Silly me. The thing that bothers me the most is fatiuge. That is my main problem. When I scheduled the physical, fatiuge was my major complaint. Also, I get rather moody. I thought that I was depressed or something. 2003 was not a good year for me. We had a lot of unusual things go on during the past year so I just thought I was really stress out or depressed maybe. Is moodiness a symtom? I have searched a lot of websites and I cant find that it is. Thanks again, Cheryl",

      "Content": "Heather, Thank you for your help and suggestions. Are drug studies open to anyone? Should I ask my doctor about this or will he suggest it? Hopefully, its not going to be necessary but perhaps I should start thinking about this kind of stuff. I am so glad I have found this board. So far I have received lots of help and suggestions. I truly appreciate all the support. Cheryl",

      "Content": "mnenosyne Thanks for the input. No I have not had a CA-125 test done because initially she thought it was my bladder. This mass must be sitting right on top of it. Unfortunately, she could not feel the ovaries to get a better idea as to what the problem was. I did have every other type of blood test though and they all came back normal. Not that this is relevant but I also had a chest x-ray and an EKG and both were normal. The strange thing about this growth is how it happened so quickly. Or maybe they do grow quickly, I don\u0092t know. I have a pap and pelvic exam every year. The last one I had was in August of 2002. I did miss 2003 because we moved but it has only been about 15 months since the exam in August. I can\u0092t understand how something the size of a basketball could develop in only 15 months. Now, I will say that I went to regular GP\u0092s and not gynos for my physicals but if this doctor was able to find something, she is a GP, why weren\u0092t the others able to find something too, if it were there? Again, maybe they do grow fast, I don\u0092t know but that will be one of my questions to the doctor. My PCP called me yesterday to see how I was doing. I told her what the ongoloist secratary said about possibly not having to do surgery. Because he has already scheduled surgery, she thought that he would in fact be doing it and I should plan on it. So, I guess we'll have to wait and see. My husband and I are going in to see my PCP today to ask a few more questions. Its hard to discuss things of the nature over the telephone. Besides he (my husband) has lots and lots of question and he doesnt want to wait until Tuesday to get his answers. What is \"optimal\" debulking\"? Again, thanks for your help! --Cheryl",

      "Content": "butterfly, Thank you for the explanation of optimal debulking. If this is cancer it sounds like this would be something I would want him to do. Am I correct? <feeling full faster when you're eating?? Yes, I have to eat smaller amouts but I eat several times a day <fevers, chills or night sweats?> fevers,-not really but I do get the chills so maybe I do have a fevers...I guess I have not taken my temp. Night sweats..yes sometimes <increase in belching> Yes, but I have an ulser so I thought it was due to that. Same for the change in my eating habits. I thought it was due to my ulser. Again, thanks for the input. --Cheryl",

      "Content": "This is a little long so please bear with me. Tuesday I went to my primary care provider for, what I thought would be a routine physical. She found a \u0093mass\u0094 in my lower abdomen. We both thought it would be my bladder since I have had to pee a lot lately. She sent me right over to the hospital for a CT scan. She called me last night and said I have a basketball sized mass on one of my ovaries (I forget which one). The radiologist told her it looks \u0093suspicious\u0094 for cancer. She is now sending me to a gyn/ongologist. I see him on Tuesday and according to his secretary he has already blocked me in for surgery on Wednesday. However, depending on what he finds during the visit on Tuesday I may not need surgery. What could it be if it\u0092s not a tumor? Even if it\u0092s not a tumor why wouldn\u0092t he want to remove something like that anyway? I do have some of the symptoms associated with ovarian cancer i.e. bloating; weight gain, gas and I have to pee a lot. In addition to those things I have been so tired lately I can hardly stand it. I thought the fatigue was due to the holidays plus I just started a new job in October plus we relocated to another state in August plus my brother passed away in May, so things have been a little stressful the last several months, which could cause fatigue. A few years ago, I was diagnosed with an ulcer so the bloating and gas could be due to that. I had a hysterectomy of my uterus about 8 years ago but they left in the ovaries, obviously. I turned 45 in November and I\u0092m hoping that I am too young for cancer. My husband and I are going to see my primary care provider tomorrow to ask her some questions about this. Any thoughts or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.",
