    "Content": "For the past month in a half or so I've had this pinkish mark on the top of my left breast. When I feel it, there is not a lump present, but it's almost like it's bruised or something on the outside of the skin. Yesterday, my breast felt sore probably cause I was rubbing it too much or something. I am not having any discharge and had my last breast exam in October. Guess I should be doing my monthly exams. Do you think I should see the Dr. or just assume it's a small bruise that never healed?",
