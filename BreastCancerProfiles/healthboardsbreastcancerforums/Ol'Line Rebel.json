      "Content": "ER is not going to help you. I think you need to shake it up and get to a doctor who might be most associated with these types of things. If your general practitioner (GP) is not helping, maybe look for another GP. If your gyno is not helping and taking you seriously, try another gyn. Don't keep beating on the same door and getting the same answer. 2nd opinion, if you will. I know it can be hard due to insurance (and so many doctors these days refuse to see anyone without an official \"physical\" - the hell with that; I'm sick, just look me over!), but you have to try. (Actually, specialists are easier than GPs in this regard - no \"physical\" needed.) Try the new clinics in the cheap stores, like chain drugstores and Target/WalMart. Or any walk-in clinics, some of us have locals as well as chains are popping up just for this. Some of them may take you seriously.",

      "Content": "Don't you hate that? I wish I could tell you more. I have to say the \"orange peel\" concerns me. This reminds me of my sister's inflammatory BC (IBC) - but she didn't complain of that, just the other IBC symptoms. But I'm no expert. In any case, I would insist on getting full tests, perhaps MRI, ASAP. Often lesser mammos cannot see this kind. Make a deal with the doctor/radiology; they'll often help out. Otherwise, damned insurance and say you'll pay yourself, the good old-fashioned way (I did this when no HMO-type \"approved\" doctors would help me with my serious ear/dizziness/balance problems, although it's never been that expensive). They can bill you and bottom line is you'll get your treatment regardless. If you get insurance, then you might be able to plug it in after the fact. I hope all is well. God bless and good luck.",

      "Content": "I got a \"diagnostic\" ma-mmo/ultrasound today. They found several interesting things. Want me to check on some nodule in my right in 6 mos. I go in for a biopsy tomorrow on my left. The doctor there said there is a \"single smooth nodule\" under my nipple. I'm a little frightened. She said it wasn't rough so it must not be a simple cyst. I know that singlulars are worse than multiples, but now it seems \"smooth\" is worse than \"rough\"? At least I felt they were taking me seriously. It seemed my gyno didn't so much, just sending me for a mam/US despite my protests about my sister's IBC (even if they ended up getting something).",

      "Content": "Thought I'd post an update. Finally got results of the biopsy. It was all clear - apparently not even infectious. I guess I still have to hold my breath about these other \"nodules\" but for now, at least it seems things are clear. I am so glad; I hate the idea of leaving my little boy.",

      "Content": "Hi; I'm a 41 yo woman with many issues (sift through my posts). I've even had a heck of a week with heart palpitations as well as this. Too much to tell; let's say I spend lots of time with doctors as it is. The last few months I noticed WHEN I LIE ON MY BACK that my left nipple seems to be what they call \"retracted\" - sort of collapsing on 1 side. Apparently, this is NOT the same as the term \"inverted\" commonly used, and retraction is the real alarm for cancer, not true inversion. So there's 1 thing that concerns me (I don't seem to see retraction when standing, etc.). The other is sort of related to my heart. It's my left breast so that is over my heart, which had alot of palps this week. Given my digestive problems, I'm not shocked a few palps, because that's common to us sufferers. But lately, and pain I've felt I assumed was my heart - or maybe a muscle pull, or even nerve problems (another issue I have, thanks to \"accidents\"). Worst of all, my (half-)sister has INFLAMMATORY breast cancer, now Stage IV. Reading about the nipples, this led me to IBC reading, which is rare and doesn't show up well with images (hence my sister lost time as docs dismissed it as infections, etc). I don't feel 1 bit of lumps or \"thickness\", but I do feel those vague burn pains around my left breast. So now, between the 2 symptoms (notably the nipple, which rarely happens for anything else) and my sister's history, I am pretty much convinced I have the same as she. I'm scared as hell. I'm partly just griping, but wondering what anyone else thinks. I have a gyn appt next week, and I want to INSIST he do more than just feel me and mammo me. They did not find sis' that way.",
