    "Content": "I'm 17 and I've heard it's almost impossible for girls this young to have breast cancer. However, I've had a lump in my breast for several months and I feel like it should have went away by now. It isn't painful. It's not located near my armpit. It's about an inch and a half to the right of my nipple. It's very hard, but moves a little bit beneath my skin. Should I be concerned?",
