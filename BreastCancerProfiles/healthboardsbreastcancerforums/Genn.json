    "Content": "Quote: Originally Posted by akahoneypotqt I am posting here, as I have in the bowel board. I have had a pain in my lower L ab area for the last 6 months. It is about 3 inches to the left and then 3 inches down from my bellybutton. It is not intense, just irritating. My bowels are fine, no problems that I am aware of. No history of female problems. Periods are normal, and regular. No cramping, swelling, bloating. This pain is like a little hot poker. My pap was normal. My ultrasound for the pelvic area was normal. My old doc said \"I just don't know\". My new doc thinks IBS (irritable bowel syndrome) except I don't meet any criteria for anything that I can find to read on. It pokes me like someones finger, real quick and hot and then gone!. It happens when I move, when i sit still, when I drink something or for no good reason. I have had a c section in 7-90 and one in 1-94. A spinal fusion in 9-02. I don't think it's diverticulosis/diverticulitis. Possible endrometriosis? colon cancer? ovarian cancer? I need help people...... Thanks.........Mary It sounds a lot like what I experienced when I had cysts on my ovaries, BUT, they would have seen that in an ultrasound... My SIL has endometriosis, and had similar complaints, but I beleive they can see that in an ultrasound as well... Have you ever had your colon checked? I hope you find an answer soon!",
