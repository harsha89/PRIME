      "Content": "thanks Sophie, I talked to my daughter's house manager later yesterday and she said that the report went to my daughter's doctor. So hopefully she will find out later this week. From what I understand that if they do the biopsy ultrasound its a needle put in when its ultrasounded? Is that what your daughter had? or did she have the whole lump removed? Cause I wouldn't think the biopsy ultrasound would take 5 hours. Thanks, Linda",

      "Content": "I know what you mean about the fears a mother has when it involved her children. My daughter is 27 and has special needs. 3 months ago a small lump was found her her right breast. Her dr found it at her physical. The did an ultrasound. At the ultrasound they couldn't find the lump her primary care dr found. We were told to go back in 3 months and if the dr finds it to have her mark it with a marker, they said its probably fiberous tissue. Last week she went back to her dr and the dr found it again. It is very small. The dr used a marker and marked the spot of her lump. Today she had another ultrasound. The lump is very small. They said fibroadenoma(not sure of spelling) They said its probably benign. They are going to watch it. As my daughter lives in a group home I didn't go for the ultrasound and they also said something about a biopsy ultrasound. I'm waiting for a call back from the house manager as i'm confused about it. Are we watiing or doing the biopsy ultrasound. Are fibroadenoma's all benign. Or am I just a worrisome mother. My daughter has been through enough in her life I surely hope I'm worrying for nothing. Any advice will be appreciated. Thanks",
