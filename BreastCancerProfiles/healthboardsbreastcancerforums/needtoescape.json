      "Content": "Hi, I finally had the ultrasound and the lump is solid - so biopsy is the next step. I know 80% of biopsies are benign. But I can't help but worry - mostly because of other health problems I have. All those vague ones that usually get ignored - abdominal pain, fatigue, nausea. I've been dealing with the abdominal pain and fatigue for over a year. The nausea is newer. And the one that scares me the most. Unexplained weight loss... I am 5'2\" and have weighed as much as 282 (I should weigh between 110 and 126). Never have I lost weight without trying very very hard. I am down about 40 pounds and quite a bit was without trying. Even if the breast lump is benign, I am worried about cancer is some part of the digestive system. I see my gastro. doc in about a week. I get regular endoscopy because of a pre-cancerous condition in my esophagus - so I would nothing nothing could have developed there without being caught early. Never would I have believed that losing weight would worry me. If the lump is cancer, I am guessing it started elsewhere since I have the abdominal pain/nausea for quite some time now. I see my reg. doc tomorrow to get his suggestions on what surgeon to see for the biopsy. I just hope I can get in soon and get it done soon. I found the lump Aug. 2 and it took until last week to get the ultrasound. I am leaning toward asking them to take the whole lump out - rather than the needle biopsy or core biopsy. Oh, one other good thing: the lump has smooth edges - so that increases the chance it's a benign fibroadenoma. Anyone have a cancerous tumor that had smooth edges? Also - did anyone have cancer in their breast that began in some other primary site? Anyone have opinions on types of biopsy? Thanks.",

      "Content": "I really really appreciate your reply. I know I will feel silly about being so worried when the biopsy is over with and benign, but I know everyone else is the same way! Just the possibility is enough to make a person crazy. I see the surgeon tomorrow and hopefully will get the biopsy set up soon. I also want it OUT and plan to specify that I want an excisional biopsy unless that is not feasible for some reason. I think it's small enough and close enough to the surface for that. I'll post back and let you know the outcome. Hopefully it will be benign. On the other issues, I see my gastroenterologist next week and I'm going to ask for an endoscopy at the very least to ensure that nothing has developed in the esophagus. And of course, I'll let the various doctors know all of the issues going on so know one is in the dark. I guess being unemployed right now is a mixed blessing. But I'd like to get it all resolved and be gainfully employed within a few months! Thanks again. It helps just to know someone read my post and cared enough to take the time to reply. Hugs. N2E",

      "Content": "Good luck Valley. I hope your lump is benign. My incision is healing well. One thing they didn't warn me about is the hardness and I was a bit concerned until I called the surgeon's office and they said it is \"normal\". I don't know how long it lasts, but it will make it difficult to detect any future problems if it stays this way. I now have a fairly large hard area where the surgery was done to remove the lump. My reg. doc. said it's probably from a hematoma that will eventually absorb into the tissue.",

I don't do the self exam very often, so finding the lump was why I finally scheduled the mammogram. I'm fairly sure it will be just some fibroid thingy - but I'll be glad to get the test done on the 5th. Thanks again.",

      "Content": "I found a lump Aug. 2nd in my left breast. I would describe it as jelly bean size/shape. It's around the 2:00 or 2:30 position (as in a clock). It is painless and does not move. They got me in for a mammogram fairly quickly. The results were \"no abnormalities found\". Although I had specified where the lump was and they marked it, there was no explanation of what it was in the test results. I waited until my next doc. appt. to see if his version of the test results was more clinical/descriptive, etc. It was not. He then felt the lump and said we needed to do an ultrasound. That was not able to be scheduled until 10/5. Should I be worried about the 2 month time frame between when I found it and the ultrasound? I think I feel something deeper down also (same breast), but it is harder to describe -more like a ridge and is probably just muscle or something. Do they ever do a needle biopsy at the same time as the ultrasound? Any info. you can provide would be appreciated. Thanks.",
