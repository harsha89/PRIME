    "Content": "My 1 year old daughter has had this same kind of bump on her aereola for almost as long as I can remember. Her is much smaller than a pea though as she is so young that would make sense I guess. It has always stayed the same size and was flesh colored. Until the last couple days I have noticed it has been getting a bit bigger. Well today it is RED and looks painful and is also considerably bigger. I'm having it checked out tomorrow so I will let you know what the Doc says.",
