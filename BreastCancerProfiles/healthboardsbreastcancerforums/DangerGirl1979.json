      "Content": "Well the ultrasound came out saying that it was just an increase in density of tissue. just fatty stuff i guess. i am not worried about it at all, mainly because i have exams and dont need another stressor! and also because i am going travelling for a few months so i cant be bothered! i really think its nothing. it hasnt changed in size or prominence in the past 2 months or so and doesnt hurt or anything. so i am just going to leave it alone because i think its really nothing. but thanks for asking!",

      "Content": "hello, i was wondering if people could share their experiences with breast cancer scares or if they have normal lumps in their breasts. my doc noticed a lump, and i had to go in for a follow-up right after my period started to see if it shrunk, which it did not, so now i have to go in for an ultrasound (this tuesday) to see what it is. my mothers aunt on her paternal side had breast cancer, but thats it. I am kind of worried, but trying to remain calm, since worrying wont really do anything for the situation! oh by the way, i am only 23- does age matter when considering risk factors for breast cancer?
