    "Content": "Found a lump in my breast. This thing went from nothing to 6 cm in a month. The doctor said he was sure it was a fibroadenoma but ordered a mammogram anyway. He called today and said they found \"something and another thing\". That's the way he put it. I was so stunned I didn't think to ask him what he meant. I'm having an ultrasound next week followed by a biopsy. The biopsy will be delayed because I'm on a blood thinner and they want to wean me off it first. Needless to say I'm going insane with worry, especially since the doctor didn't sound too optimistic. Can anybody tell me anything that might make the wait more bearable?",
