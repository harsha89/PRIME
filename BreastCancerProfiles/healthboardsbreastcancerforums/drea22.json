    "Content": "Several months ago i discovered a clear and sometimes cloudy nipple discharge coming from my right nipple. It only comes from one duct and only when i squeeze it. I have always been very afraid of cancer since i was very little and im really worried. I was wondering if anyone else has experienced this and what it turned out to be if a bioposy was done. I know breast cancer is rare at my age 22 although after reading some about nipple discharge i found out that unilateral discharge of any color or consistancy is an indicator of breast cancer especially if its origionating from one duct only. I have had breast problems since i was young, cysts at around 10 and a small fibroadenoma since about 16. I have seen a gyn recently who blew me off after prolactin and thyroid tests were normal, now i dont know what to do, im scared to go to a surgeon, any input would be greatly appreciated, is this normal?",
