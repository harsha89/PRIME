      "Content": "I'm so worried after finding a small pea size lump in my right breast last week. I made an appointment and was seen by gp on the Monday, and she said she was referring me to breast clinic. She didn't give me any reassurances at all, she is well known for her lack of bedside manner, and she just said if I hadn't heard anything in two weeks to get in touch with the surgery again. I'm 44 years old. This last week has seen me on an emotional rollercoaster, and I'm now feeling so anxious after prodding around in my armpit on the same side and finding a similar lump last night. I'm a single mum with two teenage boys and feel very alone and desperate for reassurance. My sensible head tells me to just hang in for appointment, but i've lost my appetite, not sleeping especially as I'm suffering from night sweats and have done for a few years. Not sure what I'm expecting from here, as I know no one has the magic answer to make me feel better. But putting it down and hoping is better than going crazy here.",

      "Content": "After all that worry, it turned out to be a cyst fortunately. The consultant examined it, sent me for a mammo and ultrasound to confirm her diagnosis. She did offer to drain it there and then for me but with the relief I felt I wanted to get home asap. It's made me more aware of my breasts and even though I dread finding more, which she said is likely, I'm hoping I will deal with it better next time. I now check my breasts probably weekly which can only be a good thing. Finding this forum was a blessing and I found huge comfort from it. Thank you",

      "Content": "Thank you for replying. It's been a very long day, and feel drained with the worry. There is no family history as far as I know, so that in itself is reassuring. I was coping ok until I found this other lump deep in my armpit. I couldn't help myself and went on the internet and diagnosed myself with all sorts. I'm hoping that I get seen this week as my mind can't take much more. Thank you",
