      "Content": "Thanks Charli, it was good to get a reply. I have already started the guard/advocate momma-from-doctor's-worst-nightmare thing. It might be absolutely nothing .... but when it comes to your kids, you don't want to rest until you're certain that everything is ok. The discharge just started for no apparent reason. My daughter has been getting her period for a bit over a year. The doctor had originally thought it might be hormonal ... but was then thrown out when it wasn't from the nipple itself. Prolactin levels were fine. Swab of the discharge came back clear. Ultrasound did show some cysts. The discharge is from left nipple only, and can leak spontaneously (without squeezing it or anything). I will definitely look into the mammary duct ectasia thing. Thanks so much for your thoughts.",

      "Content": "My 13yr old daughter has had a brownish coloured discharge leaking from her left areola (not from the nipple itself) for the last 3 weeks. There is no obvious mark or wound that the discharge is coming from. There is no lump, and it is not painful. She has had a swab taken, blood test (for prolactin level) and an ultrasound, but doctors still don't know what it is. We have been referred to a breast specialist ... but I'm not sure how long before we get to see the specialist. Does anybody have any ideas/been in similar situation? Surely 13 is too young for cancer? My mother was diagnosed with breast cancer a year ago, so I'm a bit worried",

      "Content": "I might have to see if my GP can do something. I mean, I keep telling myself that it can't be anything bad (she's too young) ... but it still scares me. I saw an interview with Anastacia (the singer) last night, and she is so honest and open about her breast cancer. But one of the things she said was that it seems to environmental now, and that women should get mammograms younger. It made me think .... could we be causing things like cancer to be hitting at younger ages etc, simply because of how the world is going? When my son was born two years ago, he was diagnosed with hypospadias (a condition where the penis isn't developed properly). Now that is apparently a fairly modern condition. They are not sure what causes it, but believe it's due to exposure to chemicals or something while the mother is pregnant. We live in a fairly industrial type of town, and there are factories etc that are releasing fumes into the air. And it just makes me wonder. I mean, who really knows what these companies actually get up to, and what effect does it have on people's health. I could be completely off base .... but with what happened with my son, and now my daughter having some unexplained discharge .... I feel like just packing everything up and moving out bush lol. Probably just a worried mum totally over- reacting, but I am starting to lose faith in what we humans are doing to our world",
