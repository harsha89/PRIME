      "Content": "Hello-I just had a chest CT w/ contrast, and the result said that I have \"a prominent no. of subcentimeter lymph nodes in the axilla, superior mediastium and lower neck\". Does anyone have an idea of what this means? I haven't found anything other than articles on Breast Cancer and Lymphoma. Any thoughts on lymph nodes in the neck, chest and arm pit areas? Thanks, Lorie",
