      "Content": "Quote: Originally Posted by uptownJ I have had several friends who have had biopsy's for this condition. A couple have turned out to be DCIS which is a pre-cancerous condition. They were both staged at Stage 0. One was in my best friend who is 12 years out now and the other is in a woman in her early 40's just completing treatment. I can imagine why they moved up your appointment but I would also be suspicious. I know right now you are sick with worry but you will get the information you need tomorrow. I wish there was something I could do to help you at this point. You will be ok, no matter what. I don't know how old you are (or young) but I have had lots more friends have this be totally benign and only two with the test coming back positive. Hang in there.... I have had breast cancer and just returned from my check up with my oncologist today. 5 years cancer free. Mine was early stage and breast cancer and its isn't what it used to be. Again... hang in there gal, you will be ok. Take care, Sharon Thank you so much for your reassurance. The behavior of the ob/gyn's office is what has me scared, not the reality. I have been told by radiologist and I have read that linear microcalification is a very early catch of breast cancer, and that is the whole point of mammograms, to catch these things before symptoms show. I have NO symptoms, no buckling or leaking or bumpy or lumpy or painful breasts, nothing but these linear microcalcifications. Please be honest, have you or anyone else heard of early breast cancer getting metastasized quickly or in the bloodstream? PS I am 54 and my appt is 3:40pm EST",

      "Content": "Hello folks, I have linear calcification, already had the biopsy, now tomorrow I get the results. I get the hint that its cancer, they will tell me nothing on the phone, and I received no results in the mail. The only thing that scares me is that they called me and moved UP the appointment urgently from Monday to tomorrow, that's the part I don't get. When I had my diagnostic after the mammogram (and before my biopsy on March 19th), they told me the worst scenario is an early catch of breast cancer. That to me is not drama, am I wrong? Why did they rearrange my biopsy results appointment to tomorrow, put me with the head doctor, and tell me that someone MUST come with me to hear the results? Thanks for any and all feedback TONITE! aspiesmom",

      "Content": "Hi Sharon, first I want to give you a (((BIG HUG))) and thank you so much for reaching out to me and being there when I need a breast buddy I have news: It is cancer in my right breast, an early catch apparently, my ob/gyn thinks Stage I, more tests and surgery will tell the whole story. I asked her if I am in a life-threatening stage at this point and she said NO. I sure am glad I went on that digital mammography bus at my job last February! They want to start an aggressive program right away. It is an invasive cancer so I am going to follow her instructions quickly. I have to schedule an MRI first, then fairly soon I am going to have an appointment with a surgeon (She is my ob/gyn's favorite for this kind of surgery.) It will be a lumpectomy, right mascectomy or both mascectomies so they'll match (I think my option, not sure yet). Then followup with radiation after that definitely, and chemo maybe. She said it will take the next 6 months of my life to finish the treatment, then of course after that I will be closely monitored. I am so grateful that I changed my insurance to Avmed on January 1st and I just qualified for the Sick Leave Pool at work last week! God is great I am going to look into organic foods that fight breast cancer. I will not be telling my son anything . He has autistic spectrum disorder and needs to get through just 24 more days of this hardworking semester (he is on his 4th graphic design project now!) He got an 86 B+ on his graphic design poster of himself, I'm so proud of him! That is everything for now. Thank you so much Sharon for giving your time to share all your feedback and reassurances with me, you helped me get through last nite with a good nite's sleep more than you know! This is a lot easier to handle than I thought. Best! aspiesmom",
