    "Content": "i would like to know if anyone else out there has any type of nipple discharge. I've had it on both sides before, but seems predominate in the right. it's nothing outrageous, a litte yellowish fluid, that causes my bra to stick to me. I have yearly mammograms,never any negatives. This just bugs me so bad. It's not in the middle of the nipple,but twoards the outer edge of the nipple. when my bra sticks to it, i pull it off, the skin kinda rips and i get a little blood. i'm assuming the blood is from the skin ripping. it will almost look like a little scrape. then it scabs and just stops, goes away, and comes back sometime later. not hormonal, because i just had a hysterectomy. could somebody please help me.",
