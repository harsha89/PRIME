He explained the serious side effects of the drug and explained that the bilateral is something that is not decided right now. I opted for seeing him in 6 months. Can anyone who has gone down this path with this diagnosis tell me what they did or what they didn't do and should have. I'd appreciate any help, suggestions, or advise. I live in New York and my doctor is a specialist at Columbia Presbyterian, so I'm confident in that respect. I wish everyone well. Thanks I have also started taken 2 tablespoons of ground flax seed, I put in oatmeal or cereal. My dr. said she does this. And every book I've read talks about the benefits of flax. I also take Brevail. I got it at the health food store. Have you heard of this. It naturally promotes healthy breast tissue. No side effects. I have been on it since October. The guy at the healthfood store said Oprah's is supposed to have a segment about it on the show. But I haven't seen anything yet. They have a web site. [url]www.brevail.com[/url]. I showed my dr. it and she said I could take it. I hope it all works. Bye.",

I live in New York and my doctor is a specialist at Columbia Presbyterian, so I'm confident in that respect. I wish everyone well. Thanks I just found this site yesterday. I had my very first mammo in Oct. I also had LCIs. (Which I had never heard of). Talk about scared. I had the stereotactic and my dr. recommended surgery to have all the calcifications removed. The surgery went good and the surgeon removed all the calcifications. My dr. did not recommend tamoxifen because of my age (36). And said a mastectomy is now considered too radical. I had them only in my left breast. In April I go for another mammo on my left side, then in Oct I will have mammo in both. Since all this happened, I've heard of two other women that had this. One is 70 years old and they gave her tamoxifen and the other was 38 years old and went with getting a mamo every year. She is now 50 years old and has had no other problems. There is hope. Take care.",
