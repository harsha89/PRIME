      "Content": "Hello, I am 45 years old, had a hysterectomy 9 years ago, have just found a lump in my left breast. I can feel it, my husband can feel it, my doctor can feel it, and the technician who did the mammogram can feel it. It was supposed to be a diagnostic mammogram but they didn't take any extra pictures. The radiologist said my mammogram was normal...no need for any other testing? Yet I can feel a lump and so can everyone else. My doctor referred me to a surgeon and I was questioned and made to feel stupid because I wanted it checked out further. But have an appointment this coming Tuesday. Am I wrong to want a more definate answer? I have had cysts removed from my sinuses, and other places but this lump is new. Any suggestions or advice?",

      "Content": "I go tomorrow, 5/22/07 to see the surgeon so I will see what he has to say and will post tomorrow. Thanks for all the advice... so I saw the surgeon, he could feel the lump so he has scheduled surgery for Wednesday, May 30, 2007 at 11:15. He said if I was 25 years old he would probably tell me not to worry about it, but since I'm not....he left it at that. So we will see.",
