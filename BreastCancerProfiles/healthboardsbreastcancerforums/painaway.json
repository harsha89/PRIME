My lump sounds like yours...feels like a grape, and it moves around when I push on it. (Both really good signs...round feeling and movable.) Have you had a mammogram or an ultrasound yet, or did you just find it?",

      "Content": "TJ...Please don't worry about this (I know, easy for me to say...it's not my boob, right??) No really, I have been where you are, and I did all that worrying for no reason. Remember that MOST (some studies say over 80%) are non-cancerous. I found mine myself, and they did an ultrasound, and then a mammogram...then they decided to do the biopsies. By then I was really freaking! I'm sure everything will be JUST FINE with yours also. I'm praying for you, girl, as I know how this feels. Everything will be ok. The fact that it feels like a grape is good, real good. And as I sit here, I tried pressing on mine again, and maybe it's the tissue around it that moves, not the lump. It doesn't move from one place to another, but my fingers move around it pretty easily. The Good Lord has a perfect plan for you, and He's going to take care of you! Let me know how it goes. The procedure won't be bad at all.",

      "Content": "CPACAT...Just wanted to let you know I'm praying for you. I know this is frustrating and hard, but just know that I'm here if you need to talk. I have been very close to a couple of people (aunt and church pal) who have had breast cancer that metastasized to the lungs. My church friend is going through it now, and has had it in her lungs for quite some time now (like a couple of years). Her many nodules have been reduced to a couple of nodules, and the ones left are shrinking! I'm so glad you're going to see a pulm. doc. It may very well be nothing at all, but I think (with all due respect) it was mighty irresponsible of your doctor to allow you to wait a whole year to get another CT. Catching something early is ALWAYS the key, as you well know. Peace of mind is worth so much, and you shouldn't have to spend a year wondering. I say get it checked out, and if it's nothing (which it very well could be), then you're not losing anything. Isn't it wonderful to be living in a day and age where things like this can be treated? My aunt wasn't fortunate enough...she had breast cancer about 15 years ago, and back then, they just didn't have the treatment options. It spread to her lungs, and then to her liver. I fully believe she'd still be living a full life if she had been diagnosed in this day and age....just as my friend at church.",

      "Content": "Prouddad...First off, let me say that I will be diligently praying for your wife, and for you, and the rest of your family. As you know already, cancer affects the whole family, not just the patient. Your wife is so very blessed to have you by her side, to love on her, and to gather information on and research her diagnosis. The Good Lord has a perfect plan, and He is the Great Healer and the Great Physician. He already knows the date and time in which your wife will delcare, \"I am cancer free.\" Though this struggle may be grueling at times, you will get through it together, and I believe, you'll both be stronger than ever! Please know that the people on these boards are amazing, so feel free to come and vent, laugh, cry, rejoice, or whatever will make you/your wife feel better each day. In a time like this, Jeremiah 29:11 makes me feel better... \"For I know the plans I have for you,\" declares the LORD, \"plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.\" I look forward to being with you both throughout this journey in prayer. And I look forward to the day when your precious wife is cancer-free!! That day will be here sooner than you think! So, keep that chin up, and know that the medical field has come SO far with treatment for your wife's condition. May God bless you all.",

When you press on it, does it feel like a round ball (like a grape, rubber ball, or eyeball)? 2. Does it move when you push on it, or is it stuck in place? 3. Do you have any redness or itching on the outside?",
