    "Content": "Just had a BRCA test done about 3wks ago. Dr's office called me today and left a message stating my results had come in and she had \"some questions\" for me. What questions would she have? I of course didn't get the message untill I got off of work. I do not currently have cancer. I have an aunt with the BRCA gene. She had breast cancer and ovarian cancer all before she was 35. I am 32.My other aunt had ovarian cancer and my grandma had ovarian cancer. I have had one breast lump removed and had an mri of another which I decided not to have removed unless they thought necessary. My apt to find out my results isn't untill next monday. Did anyone have experience with this genetic test? I'm just wondering what it could all mean. Thanks for any help.",
