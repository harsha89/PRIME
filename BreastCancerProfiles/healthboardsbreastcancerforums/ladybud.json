      "Content": "The inflammatory breast cancer referred to is called Paget's Disease. It is essential you get this checked, and I would guess a biopsy will be recommended. It is a different kind of cancer than the usual deep cancers that cause lumps. I am not saying that is what it is, only that that is a possibility and should be looked at and ruled out.",

      "Content": "The pea size lumps could be either, as breast tissue extends pretty far up into the armpit. I would call the GYN and ask if they want you to get a mammogram prior to coming in, so they can check the lumps and have a mammo report/ultrasound at the same time to save time and get a quicker idea of what is going on. Ultrasounds are often done at same time to check for breast cysts.",

      "Content": "Asymmetric just means that the breast tissue doesn't look symmetrical or even and balanced. The fibrous tissue can shrink and cause pulling of the tissue creating this. Cancer generally shows up as clustered microcalcifications, like tiny white dots of calcium. It would also be unusual to develop cancer in both breasts at the same time. I would follow up, and perhaps ask about an MRI of the breasts, for reassurance. I don't see anything in the report to suggest cancer, but radiologists, Drs., and patients all should err on the safe side, and follow up any abnormality.",
