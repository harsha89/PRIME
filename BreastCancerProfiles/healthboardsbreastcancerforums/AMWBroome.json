    "Content": "Hello all, I am new to the board and want to thank you all in advance of any input that you can provide. I had my baseline mammogram on Monday and got the call back today that i need to go back in for an ultrasound due to a finding of \"focal asummetry\" in my left breast. I have no family history of BC and have never felt a lump in self-exam or annual phyiscian exam. However, I am an overly worrisome person and was just wondering if anyone has dealt with this finding before? I am going back in for the ultrasound Monday, so this will undoubtedly be a very long 5 days. Many thanks!",
