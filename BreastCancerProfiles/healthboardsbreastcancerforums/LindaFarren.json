    "Content": "Hi Ruthie, Hope you feeling okay today. I sympathise with you, worrying like this will not help your depression. I suffered with PND after my first baby and I know the world can feel like a sad lonely place, no matter how many friends you have around. Try and keep positive.... I am 41 and just today doctor found a lump (or fullness as she also called it) on my left breast. I have been experiencing pain off and on for about 5 weeks on the left hand side of my boob and in my armpit and also an itchy burning sensation in my nipple (off and on) for about 2 weeks. Last night the pain was very uncomfortable and has travelled to the top of my arm and neck. To be honest, I still cant feel this lump but she said it was small and feels it is a cyst, and the fact it is painful is a good sign. I on the other hand, as I am sure you can understand am really worried. I have an 8yr old son and an 11mth son and I am already thinking the worst. Im sorry I dont have any answers to your question but thought it would be nice to talk to someone who is feeling the same way.... My doc sent off request for examination to a Breast Clinic but it will be 2 - 3 weeks before I hear back from them... I wish you all the best and will say a wee prayer for you. Take care Linda QUOTE=lilruthie44;4709278]Hi Everyone, I am 44 suffering severe depression, my partner found my lump just above my nipple in my left breast on tuesday, went to see doctor on the wednesday and now am waiting for an appointment to have a mammogram and other tests, really worried as my mum was diagnosed with breast cancer back in 2004 unfortunately she had to have a masectomy but is doing very well now... Hugs Ruthie xxx[/QUOTE]",
