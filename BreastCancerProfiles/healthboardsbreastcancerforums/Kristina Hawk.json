    "Content": "In 3-2006 I needed a mammogram because my Dr. wasn't sure what she felt (she's new). It showed five lg. calcifations clusters. I had a second mammogram and I was so sick from the exposure. They said it was something to keep a close eye on and to have another mammogram repeated in 5 months, but to call if I had any changes. I made an appointment. Later I rescheduled twice. I had an upcoming surgery for a work related injury so needed to move the mammogram even later, which made it October. I was let go from my employer (to much time off for injury) that ment no health insurance. I have applied twice for state ins. but don't qualify. Now the Drs office calls at least every other week and sends letters. I have noticed a few changes in my breast. I don't know what to do. If I have the mammogram done and pay what I can, will the insurance comp. See it as a pre existing condition if anything is found? I just would like to hear from someone. What do you think I should do?",
