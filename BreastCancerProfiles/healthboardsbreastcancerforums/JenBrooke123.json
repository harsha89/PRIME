      "Content": "Well an ulterasound takes pictures of the tissue. Certain lumps may not show up, like cysts and limpomas (begine fatty tumors).etc.. However, I don't know why your doctor did not send you for a mamogram at the very least. I would insist more testing, just to put your mind at ease. If your doctor refuses, I would go seek another opinion. Good luck.",

      "Content": "there are many reasons one can bleed between periods could be just hormons. I have had the same thing pretty much, I went for a pap in Jan and it came back abnormal ASCUS. I have a follow up pap in april. There could be a number of reasons why you are bleeding, I would go see a gyno it may be embarrassing but your health is well worth it. Quote: Originally Posted by Finally76 Hi everyone, Freaking out a little, I am 26, never had a pap smear, too embarrassed, and I am in between periods at the moment, last week I bled lightly all week, with a strange discharge (sorry too much info I know), then stopped for a day and have started again, starting with the discharge then turned into bleeding, and this is very unusual I am generally spot on everytime, so of course my mind start to go abit wild, so thought I would come on here and have you guys put my mind to rest. This is probably just a coincidence, but I have also noticed the bleeding started this time after having an orgasm (there was no penetration this time, so figure its got nothing to do with it, but last time it started was after an orgasm too, probably useless info, but it just seems it could possibly be related. Can someone help me out maybe put my mind to rest. Thank you heaps",

      "Content": "Although there is such a thing as male breast cancer. I would doubt that he has that,however I would get it checked as soon as possible by a doctor. What is sounds like is a cyst of some sorts. Keep watching it to is if it gets bigger. Quote: Originally Posted by ~Winnie~ my fiance recently noticed a tiny, tiny knot (like smaller than the size of a BB) under his left nipple that is extremly painful when he touches it, i did all the research about male breast cancer and (so far) he has no other symptoms and he just woke up this morning and his nipple was sore. he is 19 a non smoker (although he does rub snuff on occasion) he weighs 160 and is in very good health, not even a cold in the last year, and (that i can think of) none of his family members have or had cancer (but i will ask to make sure) i realize that the odds of this are pretty small but i am just so worried, his health insurance isnt effective yet and it may be a month or so till it is, so getting it looked at right now isnt an option... i just need honest advice, i am scared to death. if it isnt cancer then what else could it be?",
