      "Content": "yes, it makes sense about you only finding it laying down - i can only find mine when i'm sitting up. i had to get the dr to check it out when i was sitting as the normal position to check is laying down. sorry, i can't post the link - i'm not allowed, but for more information about different benign lumps, i just did a search on the most popular search engine out there, clicked on the symptoms link and it was the third one down.",

      "Content": "i have a lot of fibroadenomas and they tend to hurt monthly, normally the week before my period. i have one in my right breast that is up higher, on thinner skin and that hurts the most. i can get stabbing pains in my lumps at any time really though - i think it's my hormones fluctuating. a fibroadenoma is also known as a breast mouse, because they slip when you touch them. they are not hard or fixed - they feel softly rounded. the only way to tell though, what it is (cyst, fibroadenoma, etc) is through a mammogram, ultrasound and ultimately a biopsy. the ultrasound guided biopsy doesn't hurt. the last one i had was an atypical fibroadenoma. good luck with your mammo - i'll be checking back to see how you are.",

      "Content": "well, from the description you've given, it sounds very much like a fibroadenoma (slippery under the fingers, smooth, not fixed), but you can -never- be 100% sure unless you get it checked out by a doctor. for example, i have a mole on my arm that looks a bit iffy. it could be ok, but it might not. only way to find out is to have the thing biopsied and checked out. doctors will take your age into consideration when doing any tests. pre-35 and they're not so worried. post-35 they will, or should do, all of the tests regardless. my test was classed as birad4, which means it is suspicious. BUT, they basically class any lump as guilty until proven innocent. so don't worry if they act in a concerned manner. all lumps should be looked at properly. and just remember those percentages... 80% of lumps are benign.",
