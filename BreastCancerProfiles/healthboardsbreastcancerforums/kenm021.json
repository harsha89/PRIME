    "Content": "Hello, I am a 21 year old male. I have always been an athlete and pretty healthy. Except for the last 3 to 4 years. about 4 years ago i grabbed my breast firmly because it was itching. Upon doing so, fluid came out of little bumps on the areola. Never thought twice about it... over the next four years I have noticed an increase in tissue (flabbiness) around and under my nipples. I am fairly skinny so this stands out, I have actually gained and lossed weight many times over the last 2 years but am down about 15lbs overall. Anyway, there are slight bumps underneath each nipple, but ultrasound shows nothing there. both nipples can be squeezed at anytime (this was done by myself about every 3 months) and produce this fluid. Doctors WILL NOT test the fluid. I think this is the only smart thing to do...they don't even know what the fluid is? Also, somtimes in the morning my one nipple retracts inward (this is new and seems to be getting deeper), but upon touching or cold weather it becomes normally erect. A friend also pointed out that the very tip of one or both nipples is sometimes pure white in contrast to pink areola and base of nipple. Is this abnormal or am I looking to hard! Endocrinologist and other doctors see me for about 2 mins, take my money and tell me i'm normal, that there is no need for studying fluid. Any takers or similar conditions?",
