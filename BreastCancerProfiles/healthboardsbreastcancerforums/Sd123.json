    "Content": "Hello, For the last three months I've noticed that I have these brown spots on my breasts, they are like little bruises. They aren't in a region where my bra can hit them (they are near the nipple area), so I don't think it's the bra. I thought perhaps I had hit something, but its been almost three months and they have not gone away. They don't hurt at all. Does anyone know what this could be? I'm terrified that its breast cancer!",
