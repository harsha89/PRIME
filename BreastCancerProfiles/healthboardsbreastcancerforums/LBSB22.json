    "Content": "o.k...here's the thing. for the past few years I have been getting a pain under my right armpit, right next to my breast, that comes and goes. It usually would come right before my period and then go away. I always thought it was a swollen lymphnode, but i can never feel a lump. Now, it's been a few weeks and the pain hasn't gone away, but there still is no noticable lump. It's not high up in my armpit, but actually where my breast meets where my armpit ends. Does anyone have any ideas on what this could be? Should I be concerned??",
