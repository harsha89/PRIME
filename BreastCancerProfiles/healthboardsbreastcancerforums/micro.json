      "Content": "Hi all, My mom had her annual biopsy at the end of February. She received a notice telling her to return for a spot compression mammogram because it was hard to visualize a particular spot on her R breast. Fast forward to today, she went in for her spot compression. When completed, the radiologist informed her that she needed to have a stereotactic breast biopsy. This is freaking me out! This is tough because this isn't the first time that this has occurred. My mom had a regular mammogram in 2000 and they had to do a core needle biopsy. Fortunately it turned out negative. Fast forward to 2009, she had a mammogram and found a suspicious area. She had to get a FNA done. NOW THIS HAPPENS... I'm completely stressed and can't imagine what she is going through. She told me she wanted to forgo the biopsy and wait 6 months for repeat mammogram... But she thought about it and wanted piece of mind, so she went ahead and schedule the biopsy for next week. I know the odds of benign report is higher than bad report. It certainly helps to be able to vent about this. I wish I was able to help her more, but I can't. How long does it normally take to get the results? Do they provide a preliminary report immediately after the procedure? Just wondering... Thanks for reading this!",

Her needle biopsy turned out to be benign, so no surgery for her. After that, she had earlier screening mammograms. But not, she has gone back to the routine mammogram intervals. When are you having this needle biopsy? Stay strong =) I can't possibly imagine what it's like, but you have to try to stay positive!",

      "Content": "Hey all, I'm posting on behalf on my mom. I'm a little concern for her because of her recent annual checkup. Her first mammo was inconclusive so she returned for a spot compression. Immediately following that was an ultrasound. Based on what my mom told me, the radiologist said he sees a cyst with fluid and that she should return to have it aspirated and a repeat mammo to make sure the cyst is gone. However, with my curiosity and I urged her to pick up the report. When I read it, my heart almost stopped. On it it stated: \"There is an anechoic to hypoechoic probably complex cyst, with slightly irregular margins measure 6x6mm.\" \"Impression: Complex cyst in the right breast is suspicious. Ultrasound guided aspiration with post aspiration mammo as needed is suggested. BI-RADS Category 4: Suspicious abnormality\" From the sound of that report, the radiologist was sounded more optimistic when he was talking to my mom. I don't know what to make of it. Her return appointment isn't set until next week and I'm scared. She had an excisional biopsy done in 2001 for a suspicious mass (calcification) and it turned out benign. Her mom was diagnosed with breast cancer at age 60. Are they doing this out of precaution (due to family history)? Or are they doing this because the images DO IN FACT suggest something suspicious? I did a search on complex cyst and do have a basic idea of what it is. But my concern about this cyst is that it has \"irregular borders\" And from what I read, that may be what the radiologists are concerned about. According to my mom, the radiologists said \"It's probably nothing, but I want to be sure!\" What are your thoughts on this? I'm trying to be the optimistic one here, but I'm also trying to be realistic. I don't want to be too paranoid and assume the worse. It just that my mom had to deal with (e.g. thyroidectomy, trying to recover her voice, etc) so much this year and I don't want to give her any more stress. So I'm trying to go to her appointments with her armed with knowledge and information so that she can get the best possible care. Thank you all for reading. I really appreciate it. Thanks!",
