    "Content": "I dont think Docs know if they are cysts untill they remove them do they? I had a lump removed right in the docs office about the size of a grape. Took only 3 stiches to close and stung for about a week. It was tested of course and ended up being fiberous begnin breast tissue. Which is good because he didnt take it all out. It could be anything but only a biopsy with tell forsure. Best Wishes. ------------------ Cheers Autumn",
