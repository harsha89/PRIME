      "Content": "Obviously most people on this board are not going to have an answer for you. Dont waste time...Go to the doctor. I just recently found out that I have a complex cyst in my left chest (actually my breast). I am a 40-year old male. I was in shock because it is EXTREMELY rare for a man to have what I have. There is a 20% chance that it is cancer. I am having it surgically removed and biopsied in 3 weeks. Just FYI...The cyst in my chest was NOT caught by a mammogram nor a breast MRI. They only found it after I kept complaining of chest pain. They thought it was just anxiety. They sent me for a third test...a breast ultrasound. Finally they found it. It is a Complex Cyst. Go to the doctor, get tested and find out what it is ASAP. Good Luck I hope it is nothing.",

      "Content": "I am having surgery to remove a 6 mm Complex Cyst in my left breast on Tuesday, Dec. 15. The surgeon said that a radiologist will have to put a wire around the cyst before I have the actual surgery. A needle will be inserted into the breast and a wire will be placed around the cyst. Can anyone tell me why they have to do this? This part scares me more than the surgery because I was told I will be awake for this part. Any information would be greatly appreciated!!! I am VERY nervous. Thanks, Joe. (yes, I am a male)",

How long (length) was your incision? My surgeon told me that I will not be able to go back to the gym and lift weights for about 6 weeks. That sounds very long to me. It doesnt sound right. Anyone else with this experience please share your story I am having this done December 15th,Tuesday morning. Truly appreciated, Joe.",

      "Content": "Yesterday I was supposed to have breast surgery to remove a complex cyst. I show up at 7 AM at the Surgery Center and the Ultrasound Technician takes me in to start the ultrasound so the radiologist (MD) can do the needle localization. She is performing the ultrasound for about 15-20 minutes and tells me that she absolutely cannot find any cyst at all!!! The doctor comes in the room and for an additional 30 minutes they both keep doing the ultrasound and come to the conclusion that I do not have anything wrong with my breast. They said the first ultrasound (performed at a different radiology center) is flat out wrong. Im sitting there very confused and wondering what is going to happen now? The radiologist calls my surgeon and tells him that there is no cyst in my breast. It is now about 8:30 AM and my surgery is scheduled for 10:15. The radiologist tells me that he spoke to the surgeon and that the surgery is still going to take place. Now I am freaking out. I am on a bed in the Pre-Operating area with an IV in my arm and basically all ready for surgery. I spoke to the Anesthesiologist and everything was on the path for surgery. Finally at 10:30 the surgeon walks in to my room and says he does not think I should have surgery. He physically inspected my breast for about 15 minutes and tells me he does not feel any focal mass. He was leaving it up to me. I said NO WAY...If you dont think I should have surgery then I am definitely NOT having surgery. He writes me a prescription for Lyrica and tells me my pain and burning is most likely nerve/muscular/skeletal and to see him in a month. Well, thats my story, now I am going to focus on my lower back injury which will probably require surgery. I still have burning in my breast but I guess I just have to deal with it for now. Thanks to everyone for your responses and information you have given me. Unbelievable!!! Joe.",

      "Content": "I am new to this topic. I am a 40-year old MALE. Today I found out that I have a 5 mm complex cyst in my left breast. I have been having pretty bad pain in my left chest, so 6 months ago I had a mammogram. It showed nothing. Then I had a Breast MRI. It also showed nothing. I started to think I was going crazy because the chest pain was getting worse. So last week I went for a breast sonogram. BINGO... The radiologist said I have a 5mm complex cyst at the 2 oclock position in my left beast. BIRADS category 3. I am VERY happy that they found what was wrong. My question is, What do I do now? I am a male, so this subject is new to me. Thanks, Joe.",
