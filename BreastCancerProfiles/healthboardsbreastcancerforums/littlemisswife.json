    "Content": "I tried find a different area to post this as i feel this post may not be for under a cancer topic. Im sorry i couldnt g find a suitable topic. My right breast starting leaking fluid (im 27). A few days later my period came 6 days early. I visited my doctor and explained about the leaking and how recently coming up to my period my boobs hurt. She said it sounds hormonal but since only 1 breast leaking this fluid, then perhaps its not hormonal. After feeling my breast she thinks I have a cyst and has refeared me for tests. But I cant feel anything in there! My period is now finished 4 days and I noticed my breast is still leaking fluid. Its small amount. Is leaking boobs normal..... is there any need for me to worry. Im still waiting on an appointment about this \"cyst\"",
