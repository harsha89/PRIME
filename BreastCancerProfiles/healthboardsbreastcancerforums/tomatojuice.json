      "Content": "A lump was found in my right breast today. My sister(I loved her so)passed away from breast cancer 5 years ago. We lived together, and I was with her throughout the whole process. I am having a biopsy and mammogram on tuesday. Even though I was there when my sister endured this-I am still -or maybe because I was there. I am petrified. Is there anyone who can enlighten me for the good or no as to how painfull, if at all,this procedure is. The idea of a needle being inserted into the lump, makes me tremble.",

      "Content": "painaway and leea. Great to hear from other women. Very reassuring. Thanks so much. I am a little freaked, because my dear -baby sister-who I loved so-was diagnosed at 45yrs. with metastatic breast cancer. She passed at 50. My older sister also had it-but hers was diagnosed very early, and she is a survivor 10 yrs now. I can't really ask my older sister about her experiences. For some reason everything for her is-no big deal. Menopause was a breeze, even chemo and radiation for her was a breeze. I love her, but shes always been sorta strange. My son is very concerned-but hes my son. My daughter is in school in hawai. Far from me. She said shes coming home if I get sick. Hope theres no need for that.Boy I'm really going on. Just needed to vent I guess. Well, will post the results, to let you all know. Thanks again",

      "Content": "hi painaway and lea, I had the core biopsy with ultrasound today. There was no pain at all for me. Didn't even feel the needle she used to numb the area. She did it 5 times, and when she got to the 3rd one-I started to shake a little. It wasn't because of any pain-something pychological -I guess. Anyway, for anyone else about to undergo this procedure, it really is not bad at all. The only thing that I am worried about now, are the results. Right after the procedure was finished, the doctor asked me who my surgeon was. She wanted to reccomend a surgeon for me. Although she is not calling me, until Monday with the results, I felt like maybe she somehow knows already. Or maybe she just wants me to be prepared. Well thanks again. Let you know what happens",

She just said to contact the surgeon right away. I have lots of questions,as I have been reading-so as to be prepared. I guess I'll have to ask the surgeon.Does this sound normal to anyone. I really thought the pathologist would have more info, right away, such as stage, and whether it is her2 positive, and the K 67 growth rate, grade, and if they did a FISH test, etc.",

Been thinking all day today about, how much I wish the surgeon would see me sooner. Have all these fears that maybe its still growing or spreading. Just can't focus as well on the normal stuff. I've decided to call the Dr. back, who did my biopsy. She was really sweet and did say to call her for anything at all. She is also a survivor(10yrs.). She was the one who made the appt. for me to see the surgeon, but she was under the impression that it would be for Mar 3. Right now I am freaking out, a bit.",

It seems he was able to tell me some not so great news about my particular cancer. It is HER 2 positive er- pr- , meaning very aggressive. From what I have read on line-this diagnosis carries a poor prognosis. I am scheduled for surgery Mar 25th. I am still hopeful, as the pathology report will be more complete, once the surgery is done. Hopefully it has not traveled very far yet. I am sorry to hear about the problem you are having. Don't know too much about tumors in the lymph-in the neck, but I have heard that sometimes when breast tumors are soft and moveable-they are usually benign. Will keep you in my thoughts. Hoping for the best for you.",

I asked her if she could elaborate a little, and she just said that she thought their were no nodes involved, and that I should make an appointment with a surgeon right away. Later my medical doctor called and also offered very little info. He did say though that the cancer was non-invasive. This helped to calm my nerves a bit. I did make the appointment with the surgeon, but was unable to get in to see her before March 24. I felt that was quite a while to wait, and asked my medical doctor to try to get me in sooner. He is calling me back tomorrow.I would like to see the actual results on paper, of the core biopsy. Is there anyone that can tell me how or what to ask for from these doctors. I have read quite a few books on breast cancer, and have also been through it with my sister. I would like to know the actual findings. Is it too soon to ask for this? Do I have to wait until I speak with the surgeon. Why are they telling me so little?",

That loving bond between a mom and her children is so beautiful. My children are not young. My son is 29, and daughter is 25. I told my son yesterday. Don't really remember exactly what I said. But his response was something like I'm not a kid. He insisted on going to the oncologist with me tomorrow. All day I have been thinking about calling the doctor who did the biopsy-to tell her about the late appt. with the surgeon. Just when I had decided not to call her, the phone rang and it was her. She was checking up to see how I made out with the appt. When I told her she was stunned.Then I told her about the oncologist tomorrow. She said since I have an appt with the oncologist-they might want to do something before surgery-so leave it this way for now. Will post again, let you know what happened",

      "Content": "Hi lea Boy there are just so many things to think about! Saw the surgeon. She said I needed a masectomy, because the lump was right under the nipple area. Just didn't want to be with just one breast, so I chose to have a bilateral masectomy. I think she also thought it was a good idea, because of my family background. She suggested that I have some reconstruction done. I was stunned, had't really thought about it at all.I think if I have to I would do okay without breast, but in any case I am seeing a plastic surgeon tomorrow to discuss it. Seems like they are proposing to do an immediate reconstruction, same day as the masectomies-is this possible? All very confusing right now. I don't know how they would be able to do immediate implants-how do they know without having examined my lymph nodes, if I will need radiation(which from what I have been reading doesn't mix well with implants)? Also my surgery has been delayed a week, in order to get the plastic surgeon and the breast surgeon together on the same day. Guess I'll figure it all out tomorrow. Hard to make such decisions, so quickly. Thanks for your response. Hope you are doing well. Oh yes-my surgery is scheduled for the 25th.",
