Actually, its pretty standard practice to only give results out in person with the Dr. I've received results both ways, and prefer to be in the office and able to ask questions about where we go next, etc. of the physician. Hang in there!",

      "Content": "MamaDee: I am so happy for you. Congrats on the benign lesion. Carlads: You are really playing the waiting game. Linear calcifications seem to be bad, as do clustered ones. If they want to consider a mammogram-guided biopsy, they need very specific pictures to be able to put in the needle precisely where they want it. Same with ultrasound-guided biopsies. If they cannot get mammo photos clear enough, or with some problem (like off to the periphery) the doctor will probably have to go directly to the surgical biopsy. That is what happened with me. Just keep pushing them to take the next step. Putting you in limbo, waiting and waiting to schedule more photos is just not acceptable. Good luck to you, and hang in there. Regards, Pat",

      "Content": "I also had suspicious calcifications in one breast on my yearly mammogram. Further pictures did not satisfy that it was benign. They tried to do the stereotactic biopsy, but the area could not be visualized because it was way off to the side. So I had a surgical biopsy. The ssurgeon actually did a lumpectomy, removing a large enough margin in case it was cancer. Afterwards, I could not hardly tell there was anything taken out. So, know that sometimes for a variety of reasons a surgical biopsy is necessary, and it is a very easy on the patient procedure that gives 100% accurate results of whether the lump is benign or not. I wish the very best for you. Hang in there! BTW, mine was a small cancer and I feel blessed that it was caught early.",

      "Content": "Dear Uptown: Thank you so much for your reply. I would like to hear more of your story if you are so inclined to share it. I just simply have not found things on the internet re patients with discovery of a second breast involved from the very start! THAT is very disconcerting. I pondered the issue all weekend, and decided even though I did not want the complexities of mastectoies (plural) and reconstruction....that was what I needed to do. I made an appointment with the best plastic surgeon I've been made aware of in my area, and called my surgeon and told him what I wanted to do. So I am once again in the waiting game of waiting till my appt. next week with the plastic surgeon and then get a surgery date that works for both doctors. I want to start reconstruction at the time of mastectomies. I have been on very potent estrogen for 40 years aafter a very young complete hysterectomy. The first thing I had to do was start getting off the estrogen, so I am reducing it by 20%, 2 weeks at a time. So far I am at 50% of the dose I've been on for all those years, and feel ok. I don't still know what to ultimately expect from the estrogen termination, however I still have yet to read up on what a double mastectomy is like. Any information on that would be helpful too. ......anybody out there go off long term, potent (injectible) estrogen after a long time? Did you start having hot flashes, and if so....how soon did that occur? Blessings to all who read this.....I hope you are more at peace with your breast cancer situation that I am at the moment. And again, to you \"Uptown\" thank you for your advice. I have taken it.",

      "Content": "Thanks Osteopenia and Uptown for your words of encouragement, etc. Haven't written as I've been just reading and living my life, and coming to grips with what is about to happen. Pre-op tests, etc. Most interesting thing that's happened is a friend from high school and I have reconnected after not hearing from each other for tons of years. Turns out that she also has breast cancer in both breasts. Is just finishing radiation (a double shot - given simultaneously to both sides). She is the one person I have come in contact with the past few months who has handled her b.c. with lumpectomies. We are planning to talk on the phone tomorrow after emailing a while. I am honestly afraid her experience will give me doubts about my upcoming double mastectomies. Its scheduled in less than a week now. I am finally, however, feeling quite secure with my choice, and think I will be able to handle hearing her experience, and why she chose a diffferent path. I do not know the exact stages of her cancers, but they were discovered with MRI as was one breast of mine. OK, thats about it. I feel more or less ready to go forward. I still wish it wouldn't be so, but when you receive that diagnosis of b.c., it does require you to make some choices in a relatively short period of time.",

      "Content": "True words of encouragement. Thanks. Glad to hear things are going so well. I too was disappointed by the mammogram's inability to pick up lesions. Don't need any more of them as they have lost much of their credibility. Tomorrow is the day of my surgery......just hours off right now. I will update for all who might be interested in this thread when I know what I think the results are. I am optimistic regarding a outcome that is very positive and will cure me so to speak. But I donn't look forward to the pain or the healing associated with constructionof new breasts. But all good things (in this case, two new \"girls\") are worth the effort. Right?",

      "Content": "FAST FORWARD SIX MONTHS! One of my personal pet peeves is people who post for advice and are so concerned about their current breast cancer/poaaibility of BC and never do a post with what ultimately happened to them. Were they OK? Were they not OK? So this is a post six month quick recap of my journey. I had a double mastectomy in June. Cancer tiny in both breasts. Stage zero left. Invasive tiny in right breast. Reconstruction started with tissue expanders at time of double mastectomy. Came thru fine, but a double is quite a serious surgery needing a lot of healing. Had a sentinel node biopsy on one side, which was negative. Went in bi-monthly for saline into the expanders. This proved a real trial for me, and each fill got more uncomfortable than the last. Waited a month after last fill. Then had the change-out with expanders out and saline implants put in in Sept. They look good, but need a lot of touch up with fat transfers when the swelling from the recent surgery is gone. Nipples-maybe. So you see I am now cancer-free (I at least hope so) and have new perkie ones at my advanced age (Medicare) Haven't needed to wear a bra since May '12. Never had radiation, which I found out makes later reconstruction a problem sometimes. I feel blessed with the choice I made, which was to bite the bullet and just take them off, even though both cancers were small. Having both sides affected right at the beginning of my journey was the deal-maker for me. Had only one side been a problem, I would have gone with lumpectomy and radiation. The whole thing has been quite uncomforable and each surgery caused me angst, but I knew I was doing what I had to do. I can now look back on it, still feel my decision was best for me, and that is why I've written this today. Perhaps this will reach at least one person still in the \"planning stage\" of what to do next after that initial shock of discovery that there is a tiny (or otherwise) spot in your breast. Pleast email me if you would like any further \"advice\" if I can presume that is what this is. Peace to all........P",

      "Content": "I just had a biopsy/lumpectomy in one breast. Further testing via MRI found suspicious spots on other breast. First one proved malignant by core needle biopsy. So my issue is I am in this small % of people with simultaneous cancers discovered in both breasts at same time. I need to decide whether to continue with biopsies and lumpectomies of the multiple spots in the second breast, or go with a double mastectomy and reconstruction. I need to make this decision fairly quickly as the cancer is small, but also invasive in the second breast. It was DCIS in the first breeast. A decision made now means the right course of action from the start. Is there anybody who can speak from experience on this concern that I'm putting out there? Please advise. I would SO STRONGLY appreciate your input. Thanks..............",

      "Content": "Dear Sharon and all other readers: Sharon, if you go back to my original post, you will see I had a surgical biopsy/lumpectomy left breast for calcifications found on this year's mammogram. It was Stage 0 BC. Then my surgeon ordered an MRI of both breasts. It turned up 3 \"lit up\" areas after the gadolinium was injected. The largest of the 3 was biopsied via ultrasound guidance, and found to be Stage 1 (invasive) CA. So stage 0 in left breast, simultaneous Stage 1 CA right breast. The plan was to biopsy the other 2 via MRI guidance if I chose to go with lumpectomies. I came to grips with the situation over the weekend, and decided on a bilateral mastectomy with reconstruction to start right after removal of the breasts. I have an appointment next Tues. with the plastic surgeon. I would hope these 2 physicians can get me on their respective schedules ASAP, but currently don't have a date for surgery. Yearly mammograms never picked up the 6-8 mm lump in the right breast. When I asked how long it had been there, was told maybe 2-3 years. It is now seen on ultrasound, MRI and mammogram, but it may have been out of view of the mammo, as it is located quite high in the upper inner breast. Feedback from those I have shared my decision with are very positive pro-double mastectomy. Yes, I feel like I have been hit by a bolt out of the blue. Completely blind-sided as they say! But we deal with what arrives on our doorstep I guess, there does not seem a choice but to deal with this right here and now. I have attended one support group meeting where I was diagnosed. I plan to attend the next one next week, and hopefully can get a lot of info re mastectomy and reconstruction from the ladies there. Many are so young compared to me, and they have been battling this disease for years. Many reconstructions, HER2positive, triple negative.....all those things not good to hear. My problems by comparison are not so bad. HOWEVER, I am so new to all this I am feeling very frightened. I plan now to go internet and read up on what a mastectomy even entails. I haven't had the courage yet.....as you can see I have to become a fast learn on the topic of breast cancer, being unpredictibly stricken so recently. Thank you for all the information, and I will look into the aggressiveness issue. It is my understanding the cancer is intermediate and low (magnitude of strength) left and right side respectively. At least I know this is not super aggressive. The tumors are also small. So there are good features to this story if I remember to keep focusing on them, rather than fear for the sake of fear itself. Will update when I have more info............................",
