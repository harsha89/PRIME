I too am very small breasted and my dr. feels that another surgery will not leave me with much of a breast at all. I'm so glad for you. That's good news, and I think you're making the right decision about the mastectomy. If you have to go out of town, how will that work? It was my understanding that the surgical oncologist and the plastic surgeon have to operate on you in tandem.",

Now we must decide whether a mastectomy is the way to go this time around. I just hate the hurry up and wait game. Any words of wisdom? Well, I don't know how wise my words will be but I'll tell you my experience 6 years ago and how I feel today about the decisions I made. My experience: In early 1999, when I was 43, my annual mammogram showed microcalcifications. I had a stereotactic biopsy which indicated DCIS. (Ductal Carcinoma In Situ.) My husband and I decided on a lumpectomy because the recovery time would be shorter, I would still have sensation in the nipple, and it would cost a lot less than mastectomy/reconstruction. 4 days after surgery the news came: another surgery was needed to get clear margins. (This is very common, by the way.) Since the tumor was now upgraded to Stage 1, they were now concerned about lymph node involvement. They decided to do a sentinel node biopsy along with another lumpectomy. Fortunately the nodes came back negative, and they got clear margins the second time. I started radiation about a month after surgery and was put on tamoxifen, and that was it. My mammos have been good ever since and it's been 6 years. How I feel about it today: Since I am no longer facing the life-and-death reality of having cancer, I look at my poor little breast in the mirror and wish that I'd had the mastectomy and reconstruction after all. I am small-breasted to begin with (I was an A-cup) and having close to half of my breast removed created a bigger dent than I was led to believe. It is very difficult to shop for bras. My breast is still sore after all these years. I wanted to keep the sensitivity but didn't know it would be THIS sensitive. I can't handle a bear hug any more, at least not on that side. I have been thinking that NO sensation would be preferable to feeling this permanantly bruised, and at least I still would've had sensation in the other breast. Unfortunately, the option of having implants is gone now, since I've had radiation. Reconstruction can still be done, but it's far more involved, risky and expensive now than it would have been had I opted for it in the beginning. So it's not in my future. I am sorry that you're going through this, and believe me, I can relate. Remember that whichever decision you make, you will get through this. Good luck, sweetie. Keep us posted.",

You are so right about that. I had surgery in April to remove the multiple uterine polyps that developed as a result of the tamox. I went off tamoxifen last year after being on it for 5 years, and was diagnosed with osteoporosis about the same time. They put me on Evista, which addresses both of my health issues.",

      "Content": "After 5 years of taking tamoxifen for breast cancer, I have been switched to Evista. I'm 49 and still not menopausal, so my choices are limited. (I went 8 months without a period, then started it at my onc's office on the day we were going to look at my options. Consequently, my FSH that day was 11.7.) Anyway, about 6 weeks after going off the tamoxifen I started bleeding again and it still hasn't stopped after 3 weeks. So I start thinking uterine cancer because tamoxifen increases your risk, right? I got an ultra-sound and my gyno said my endometrium is abnormally thick, so he clipped off a little to send to the lab. It came back negative for both cancer and hyperplasia. My gyno says it is definitely drug-related...a kind of rebound reaction to getting off the tamoxifen. So, has anyone else had this experience?",

After my swelling went down I realized to my utter disappointment that my breast had shrunk to 2 cup sizes less than the other. I am now a B on one side and a AA on the other. Not fun to shop for bras, let me tell you. If I had known this going in, and also that my nipple would remain so sensitive that I still can't bear-hug my husband after 6 years without pain, I would have gone for the mastectomy and reconstruction.",
