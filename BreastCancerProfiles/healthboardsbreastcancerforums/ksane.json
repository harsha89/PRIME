    "Content": "Did you have it yet? I think you're getting close by now. I'm 50 and just had my very 1st one 2 days ago. I already got the results and it was negative. Didn't think I'd get the results so fast. A co-worker in the the past actually told me it hurts like labor pains! She must not have had any tolerance for pain. I felt absolutely NO discomfort whatsoever. The x-ray tech/nurse kept talking and joking and I didn't even realize we were done. NO pain, none, I promise. The entire appt took 10 minutes.",
