    "Content": "I don't know if this is in every state or in my state, but I started asking for a mamogram at age 29. The hospital told me I could not walk in and get one without a dr. opinion untill I was 32. I could not get my M.D. Or obgyn to make an appointment for me, they both told me I was too young. I had to fly to the state of Maine, to my sisters doctor to get a mamogram!!! Thank God all was well. My oldest sister Kathy has has a masectomy in her mid 30's. My sister Rhonda died of cancer on her 32nd birthday. I really wanted to be cautious. I now get my regular mamogram every year, and do self exam. If your doctor tells you, you are too young find another doctor! Cancer has no age limit!! Be strong and don't let any doctor or any person intimidate you or make you doubt yourself! Best wishes!
