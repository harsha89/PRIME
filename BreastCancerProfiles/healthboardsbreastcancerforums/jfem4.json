      "Content": "Hi Elaine, Thanks for responding... They give a little...not hard, feel almost mushy...and although there is one that I notice mostly on the lt, there are little ones just like it all around... I have to stop touching them and just try to wait until tomorrow... It's so hard, but I really have to just try to wait at this point.",

      "Content": "ok...I'll try that...but if you don't mind can I ask one mreo question?? When they say \"movable\" what does it mean exactly?? I touch the \"lump\" and I can moce it back and forth through the tissue...and it feels slippery, just like you said... Are these things \"good\" meaning less likley to be cancer?? Obviously, I know you aren't a MD, but you seem to have knowledge of this...what do you think??? SOrry for being a pain, I'm getting so anxious about tomorrow... Jane",

It feels like painful today, and I guess that's becasue I'm a week past my period... I just want it to be tomorrow , so I can know... I know that only 1 out of 12 are malignant for my age group, and that 75-80 % of lumps are benign, but it's so hard not to think that it's cancer, you know??? Anyway, thank you for your support...I really needed to talk this out with someone...",

      "Content": "I am 41, and found a lump last week...I actually found it in April, went to my gyn and he was not concerned...so I left it alone. Hadn't felt it since. Felt it Thursday...I don't know what is characteristic of breast cancer... I just know it feels mushy, and I think I feel other ones like that on the other breast. I got my period on Friday,,,never usually get anything like this when I get my period. Anyway, I touhced it so much, it started to really hurt. Then I didn't know if it hurt from my touching it , or whatever. I have a breast onc MD friend who happened to be here on Sunday visiting. I showed it her. I aksed her if she thought it was breast cancer and she said she didn't think so, but of course, only the mammo/sono on Thursday can tell. I am freaking out...can you tell me what the \"lump\" feels like when it's breast cancer? I do not know how I will make it to Thursday.",

      "Content": "thank you so much for your information.... I felt the \"lump\" so much on the weekend, that my breast was so sore, I had to stop. It is not fixed, it's mushy and when I move my position, it moves,too...like I can find it better when I'm lying down, then when I am sitting up...does that make any sense?? It's almost hard to find unless I am stretched out and my arm up... Can you feel yours when you don't have your period??? Or is it just felt the week before and during??? I don't know...I just know that I am freaking out that it's breast cancer and I really need to get a grip .... THe waiting is tortuous... I'll let you know... Thanks",
