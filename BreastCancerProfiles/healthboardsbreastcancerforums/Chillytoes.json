    "Content": "I'm glad I found this thread!! My daughter is 30 yrs old, and she found a lump in her right breast. She was sent to have a mammogram & ultrasound done, they say it looks suspicious. She was told one time mastitus (sp) and then fiibroadenoma. She is on her way for a biopsy. She said it is somewhat painful at times. Her spirits are high, I pray that it is nothing serious. She said it started out the size of a cherry tomato, now she thinks it is larger. I pray all will be ok. thanks",
