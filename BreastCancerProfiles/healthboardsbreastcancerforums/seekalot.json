      "Content": "Hello, L -- for some reason, some Healthboards computer gremlin lost my entire reply which I just spent several hours composing when I tried to post it. I really don't have time to recreate it all, so I will just briefly say that when I saw your post I had a jolt of recognition and joined this forum for the first time so I could pass on my experience in case you are interested. Last year I had similar symptoms to yours, mainly nipple itching and discoloration and the roughness. I also ignored it for 6 or 8 months or more -- not the smartest move but anyway...then the doctor thought it might be a fungus type infection so had me try two different ointments for a week each, one over-the-counter, another prescription. When these didn't fix it, he did a small in-office biopsy, a pretty comfortable and easy procedure. The lab tests from this showed I definitely had Paget's disease of the nipple. At first it appeared I would need a lumpectomy followed by radiation treatment. However, a mammogram and second, larger biopsy in a specialist's office showed some very small spots were early cancer in another part of the breast. Therefore I had to have a simple mastectomy (\"simple\" meaning the less extensive type, not involving lymph nodes) but on the bright side, I did not need radiation. In fact, because Paget's of the nipple is such a non-aggressive, slow-growing disease and usually non-invasive, I did not need to have ANY treatment outside of the surgery -- no radiation, no chemotherapy, no other surgery. I hope I am not causing you undue worry because this may not even apply to you, but mainly I am concerned that since it is a possibility, that you will be sure and have Paget's considered in the appointment you mentioned you would have. Wishing you the best...also if it does turn out to be Paget's, don't despair. As my outcome shows and as doctors have told me, this is one of the most easily treated and curable forms of breast cancer. I can say in all honesty I found the surgery itself and the whole experience, from diagnosis to healing, MUCH easier and less traumatic than I had feared. And now I am 100% free of cancer, look completely normal in all my clothes with the help of a breast form, and am almost completely healed except for minor discomfort which keeps improving -- and this is only two months after the surgery and only five months from the initial diagnosis! So try not to let your imaginary fears and worries make it seem worse than it is.",

I'm curious, did she say why she was recommending an ultrasound? I have no medical expertise and can only assume she has her reasons. Anyhow no doubt, especially with a second opinion, you will soon get to the bottom of this. Just in case it helps, I am asking a couple knowledgeable people I know (one actually an oncologist, another a volunteer lay person with lots of personal and family experience with various cancer situations) , passing on your symptoms in anonymous terms and seeing if they have any thoughts. They may feel they can't say much helpful with that little information, but I will be glad to post any responses they offer. Hope you will let post how things go. Still wishing you the best...",

      "Content": "Hi L, glad to hear from you! Been wondering and hoping all was well. I don't recall my symptoms coming and going. (In my case, itching and a reddish-brownish patchy area on part of the nipple, with some flaking at times, but NOT erect). But maybe I'm forgetting if they may have come and gone in the very beginning. I do know at times it itched less or the itching didn't bother me as much -- but the whole problem, once it appeared, NEVER simply vanished so that the nipple looked and felt normal. Don't know if that helps... If the second opinion you got was also from an M.D., sounds pretty reassuring that neither doc is alarmed and the first one even flatly said in her opinion it ISN'T Paget's. (I assume they can tell from their experience and training that your symptoms just don't match with a serious diagnosis like that.) So maybe we are looking for some kind of local injury or irritation? Do you know of any such injury or reason for irritation? Did your breast get bumped or cut or, I don't know, use a new fabric softener or detergent or body lotion...of course I'm grabbing at straws. Has neither doctor given you any clue as to what their possible diagnoses might be, such as an injury that might heal by itself or, I don't know, something to do with the milk ducts being plugged, if that's possible? I seem to recall a friend years ago had a painful breast problem due to some such blockage -- she had not had children -- sorry, memory vague on that. It's probably just me, but I'm surprised no one is suggesting quicker steps to figure this out. (I'm sure it's mightily uncomfortable for you, if nothing else!) Do you feel everything is being done that should be? Not to trump up worry, I'm NOT saying it hasn't -- just coming from the maybe overreacting perspective of a lay person who had a little bit similar (not exactly) symptoms and then of course ended up with a serious and potentially life-threatening diagnosis. But it sounds like that is NOT likely to be the case for you. Most likely they are not taking it that seriously because it is clear to them it is NOT that serious a matter. LAST THOUGHT -- Have you tried either a prescription or nonprescription anti-fungal or similar medicine on the nipple? In fact, thinking of this, I just went and looked at my old dr. appt. sheets. And on the early ones (before I had the biopsy which showed the Paget's) was written \"candidiasis\" and \"tinea corporus\" as possible diagnoses. (I recall the dr. mentioned to me yeast or fungus infections.) (I may be wrong, but isn't \"tinea corporus\" the same as athlete's foot, or close to it? Ick ) Anyway he prescribed a couple ointments for a week each to see if they helped. Wonder if you should ask one of your docs if your symptoms are consistent with such conditions (fungal or yeast infection, such as candidiasis or tinea corporus) (sorry, better check spelling).",

      "Content": "Hey, L -- your reasoning makes sense to me about if the ultrasound is just as good as mammograms why don't we all just get ultrasound and skip the radiation, but I wonder if it's because your doctor is in fact reasonably assuming that in YOUR particular case it's less likely you have cancer than someone older with similar symptoms so she doesn't want to expose you to the radiation risk unnecessarily. Like I said, I have no expertise, but in support of that thought, both the responses I got when I passed on your info said that ultrasound can in fact detect some cysts or tumors. Also, I was told that breast cancer does NOT usually show up as scaly, itchy and erect nipples, and that scaliness and itching may instead be a sign of eczema or scabies. Apparently there CAN be itchiness and scaling with a type called inflammatory breast cancer but that usually involves retracted nipples, this person thought (not the oncologist). Both agreed it was a good idea that you are getting another opinion, maybe best from a breast cancer specialist or perhaps a dermatologist, since breast cancer can occur in your age group, though it is rare. Sounds to me like you are handling things right and should be getting some answers soon. Best, S.",

      "Content": "Thank you, phaedrus, for your kind words. I have responded to a few posts here, but it seems most of the questions aren't anything I can help with. I'm surprised too that there are so few post-mastectomy people here. Maybe it's because after our experience with cancer ends, it's not something most survivors are eager to keep \"revisiting\"...takes a special mind-set or desire to be helpful to others. It's so much more tempting to just \"move on\" and try to forget about the trauma of it (just human nature). I guess I'm selfish too, but I had decided I didn't want to get into a breast cancer group. I thought it would be depressing and maybe even more traumatic, and that was the last thing I needed. But maybe I'm wrong... Thank you again for jumping in. Much appreciated.",

      "Content": "Hi, I feel self-conscious to ask these questions but really need and appreciate any advice on these two things. 1) TYPES OF BREAST PROSTHESIS -- I had a left mastectomy over 3 1/2 months ago and now have a prosthesis and bras (which I am glad to say, look very good and normal), but now the prosthesis is starting to feel a little heavy, the weight of the bra band seems to make my rib area sore and also the way the prosthesis pushes into me (I guess) has made the remaining tissue (the surgeon left the underlying structure and tissue) sort of lumpy and cave in or flatten in and out instead of being smooth and rounded like it was. (Or could this be a natural part of the healing process? sure looks ickier.) I went back to the mastectomy boutique where I got the items. After they first just tried to adjust the bra straps (which I should have tightened myself because the bra had stretched out in the 6 weeks I've had it, and the tightening maybe helps a little, but not a lot), they said they would order a 1500 prosthesis which she said doesn't lay up against you or something. Does anybody know about the different types of prostheses? What is a 1500 type prosthesis? (I asked and couldn't seem to get much specific information.) How is it decided which prosthesis you should use? At the shop I was originally just told \"this is your prosthesis\", with no choice or options given, not that I would have known what to choose. 2) STARTING SWIMMING AFTER MASTECTOMY -- I am trying to regain my energy and optimism and do things like swimming, which I used to do, and having trouble getting started. I've become about 40 lbs. overweight in the last 5+ years and so was already having a heck of a time finding halfway flattering swimsuits anyway. And now this!! (the surgery) which I guess limits me to mastectomy suits? The boutique had some suits, I tried a few on and just wanted to DIE. I don't understand this clinging spandex the swimsuit designers seem to love, which wouldn't flatter 90 percent of us, I don't think! Anyhow I looked and felt like a little barrel with these delightful rolls clearly outlined for all to see and enjoy! And then the \"missing\" upstairs story Feeling pretty freakish... I did find one black two-piece swimsuit which I think they call tankini style which the top draped rather nicely instead of clinging that awful way, but in order to be big enough to drape down my midsection, the cups were ENORMOUS (too big)! And the panties part of it was like wearing small and way-too-skimpy-style underwear, no thank you! So anyhow...anyone post-mastectomy (or anyone else, thanks for any thoughts), how do you deal with swimming? Wonder if I could use a regular suit and try to put a regular prosthesis in the built-in bra part? I understand there are also special swim prostheses that are lighter and maybe $100. Does anyone use them? Does anyone swim with a regular prosthesis? I am pretty discouraged right now...with the extra blubb I've acquired and now the loss of a breast I feel kind of freakish, basically just want to hide away (and eat, the perfect solution . I know I need to skip the self-pity, start swimming to help get the weight off, etc., but having trouble getting started. sorry this is so long. Thanks very much for any help!",

The discouragement factor is a hard one but can't be given in to... Must say I am surprised and still a little disappointed that no one here seems to be post-mastectomy and can share their experience with prostheses, swimsuits and such. Maybe someone will still come along and jump in! I hope so, I would really appreciate it.",

Hope you will heed them and get this checked out right away, just on the slight chance it is a problem that needs timely treating. I say this because I had itching and redness in one nipple and it turned out to be the Paget's (which as Jennifer mentioned is pretty rare, but you never know...) I am completely fine now and they say this type is very unlikely to recur. Also luckily for me, and for you in the unlikely case you may have it, it is one of the slowest-growing and my doctor said easiest cancers to treat.

      "Content": "Joella, I'm no expert either but wanted to offer two thoughts. (I think I felt a lot like you on the eve of my mastectomy, thinking maybe this is simply not necessary at all, but after almost cancelling my surgery, I came to understand what was behind the mastectomy recommendation and realized it was really by far the safest, if not the only safe choice.) Anyhow my two thoughts I wanted to pass on are -- first, I noticed you've already had two lumpectomies. That's a pretty strong suggestion to me that your surgeon has most likely gone as far as possible to preserve the breast, and if he now finally believes it's time for a mastectomy, I at least get the feeling he has tried as long as medically possible to avoid it and still defeat the cancer, and now yes, it's time. I know in my case the initial plan was also for a lumpectomy (when I was first diagnosed with Paget's of the nipple), which would be followed by radiation of the breast. But a mammogram then showed a cluster of five tiny microcalcifications a little deeper in my breast, and then a biopsy showed them to be early cancer. (I'm not sure if there is always a clear line between pre-cancerous and early cancer, so that may be a consideration in your doctor's thinking too.) So, when the cancer was found in more than one spot, a lumpectomy was definitely no longer the treatment they could recommend, I HAD to have a mastectomy. In fact, in my case my surgeon did not want to even do two lumpectomies. (Although our comparisons are probably not exact because perhaps you had two lumpectomies in basically the same spot attempting to remove the same risky or cancerous tissue, if I understand you, whereas my cancer (cancers?) was in different spots.) Second, another factor my surgeon explained it to me was that radiation treatment is not like a sort of sweeping wide beam that just splashes over the whole breast but rather has to be aimed at a particular, single, specific target spot. But if they know the cancer has spread to more than one place, they don't know where to aim it anymore for the radiation to kill the cancer. Another factor against keeping the breast which my surgeon mentioned was that when they found some clearly cancerous changes in the breast tissue, that meant that other surrounding tissue also would have had changes that made it dangerous, that other cells would also be beginning to undergo changes that would continue to get worse and imperil my life, though they may not have been clearly visible as cancerous yet at that point. That was my understanding anyway. Just for your info about me (as I mentioned in another thread last week headed something like \"nipple change\" which you might want to check out, though I think I'm pretty much repeating most of it), my procedure, a simple left mastectomy, was about two and a half months ago and I have been amazed how much easier the surgery as well as the healing has been than I expected. Admittedly I'm still somewhat feeling my way through the aftermath myself, but it is really is by far NOT one of the worst things that could happen, as I had feared. Really it has been a somewhat unfortunate event, like life throws at us sometimes and we move on, that's how I'm experiencing it. Wish I could help you also realize it will work out and you will be fine!!! For me at least, my worries and fears were by far the biggest challenge. Also remember, luckily for you and me, many folks have unfortunately been through this experience before us and I'm sure you will see, as I did, that our treatment is so much safer, more effective and easier to handle than for those facing our situation the earlier days. Hope you will keep us posted if you have time.",
