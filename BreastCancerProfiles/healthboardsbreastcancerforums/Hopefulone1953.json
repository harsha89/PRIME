      "Content": "Glad your surgery went well. Take what time you can to heal. I stayed home for 3 days. Only used pain meds for sleep the first 2 nights. Not worth the GI problems...If I remember correctly I had swelling of my breast and around incision in the 2nd week. Surgeon saw me for post op check at that time, said it was OK. No matter which type of radiation you pick, you will have an evaluation by a radiation oncologist, who will explain all options and answer questions. My appointment only requires about 30 minutes of my day, except for one day/week when you meet with the nurse and radiation oncologist for quick follow up. The long appointments were for initial evaluation, simulation, and planning. Started feeling a \"pulling\" sensation in my breast as the sutures dissolved, and was told that same sensation is likely to return during radiation. Hoping for good results for your path report. Do you have to see medical oncology? I will be seeing them after radiation is complete for aromatase inhibitors as my cancer was estrogen and progesterone positive.",

First as a patch, then as a pill when the patch adhesive made me break out. It helped quite a lot. I'm not looking forward to a possible return of menopausal symptoms with these pills for 5 years either... I have osteopenia and have already done the Fosamax post hysterectomy.",

      "Content": "Glad to hear things are going well! I have completed 26 radiation treatments, 4 to go. Today was my first of 5 \"boost\" treatments. Radiation was \"no big deal\" until the end of the 4th week. By then I had received 40 gy out of the total 50 prescribed and my skin started breaking down. This past week has been rather hard. Didn't think I would make it through the last few sessions, but I preservered having come this far and wanting that total \"cure\" dose. Now I've given up my bra in favor of soft T shirts and silvadene cream with non stick gauze. They explained some skin just holds up better than others. I have areas of missing skin where my bra band hits. Not a pretty site... Good thing I didn't opt for the twice/day shortened version of treatment, would have hit that 40 gy mark sooner. Now I'm told the boost treatments are no where near that area (only to the tumor bed and incision line) so hopefully it will begin to heal. Told to expect it may take another month.",

      "Content": "Wow, so sorry you have to do all this. Talk about being \"blind sided.\" MDAnderson is one of the premier hospitals in the country, so you could rest easy with their expertise. My gyn oncologist followed their protocols when we lived in Oklahoma and I was diagnosed with endometrial cancer 19 years ago. All this being said, you still have every right to ask questions, and do your own research. There is a test called Oncotype DX which determines how likely early breast cancer, stage 1 is likely to need chemo. The Herceptin website also delineates the indications for treatment of HER 2 with Herceptin. Apparently you need one high risk factor in addition to being HER 2 positive. My HER2 status was 2+ (borderline, and my high risk factor was grade 2, but my tumor size was not greater than 2 cm.) I hope everything proceeds smoothly for you. Let us know how hints are going.",

Saw medical oncologist for the first time this week. He's sending me for genetic counseling to see if insurance will cover testing for BRAC and another 2 mutations. Supposed to start Tamoxifin. Not sure how I feel about all the potential side effects. He did say it would prevent a recurrence anywhere not just in the breasts. Might also help bone density. Wouldn't prescribe Clonidine for potential hot flashes like I used previously. Said they now only use Effexor or Neurontin. Don't like the sound of the withdrawal syndrome you have when tapering/stopping Effexor. Guess I'll \"play it by ear\" and if the hot flashes are too intense, I'll try the Neurontin.",

Also that Claritin helps the aching from the Neulasta, if you have to have that the next day. Hope your treatments are going well and that you will finish soon! I have been on the Tamoxifen for 3 weeks now. Not bad @all so far(fingers crossed...) a little nausea and dizziness. Two or three hot flashes, not enough to need to treat. Told to take magnesium supplements along with my Vit.D to help avoid the muscle aches, leg cramps and so far, so good. Hoping the Tamoxifen will actually help my bone loss. Will see genetic counselor this Thurs. regarding need for testing. Filled out over 20 page questionnaire in preparation for the appointment. Would have preferred this to be done last March prior to my surgery. Didn't see medical oncology till last month and that's who referred me. Hope you continue to do well. Keep us updated.",

      "Content": "Clonidine is an anti hypertensive medication that they now use to treat a variety of disorders based on observed reactions in people that were taking it for their blood pressure but had improvement in co occurring conditions. One of which is that it improved the night sweats and hot flashes of menopausal women. It also makes you drowsy within an hour of taking it, so great @ bedtime. I'm sorry that you need surgery for wider margins. I was told that if my margins were not clear that I would need additional surgery as well for wider margins and lymph node evaluation. Fortunately they were clear so no lymph node surgery and no margin resection surgery. The difference most likely is that my \"disease\" was two types of DCIS- solid cribiform and micro papillary. Both confined to the milk ducts. One in upper outer quadrant and the other right at 12:00. The radiation treatment field includes part of my axilla. 11 down, 19 to go. Some swelling and tenderness with certain movements, but otherwise OK. Skin is starting to stay pink, so am using recommended cream twice/day. No surgical glue, just dissolvable sutures so no chemical irritation. Had enough irritation just from the steri strips due to my adhesive allergy. Good luck with your up coming surgery.",

Spent 1 1/2 hours @ radiation oncology today for initial eval, question and answer session. They are going to irradiate the entire breast to prevent a recurrence in that breast. Should a recurrence occur despite this, they would then probably suggest a partial to total mastectomy. There is a study that just finished that was done to see if a recurrence could be treated with lumpectomy and radiation a second time. The results are not available yet, but they seem to think it may be possible based on what they saw. The hope is that by irradiating the entire breast the first time, your chances of a recurrence in another part of the same breast are much reduced. Good luck with your surgery. Let us know how you are doing.",

That being said, I do believe that an excisional biopsy takes the entire \"lump.\" I also think surgeons allow themselves some \"wiggle room.\" When they do not know exactly what they may find, they may have you sign a consent for a little more than they expect to do - just to cover the unexpected incase they need to do more. This was the case with my surgery. It was explained that I would be having 2 lumpectomies, but that the consent was for a partial mastectomy in case there was a need to do more once they were in there and accessing the situation. You have to trust your surgeon will do what's best for you and only what's necessary. That is why you have to establish rapport and good communication prior to any procedure. I explained in my answer to your previous post on discordant biopsy, that my lumpectomies were done for an area that was positive for intraductal carcinoma and an area that was supposed to be atypia but turned out to be a malignancy as well. If your excisional biopsy is negative, the area in question will be gone and that should be the end of it. If positive, then the follow up is most likely radiation.",
