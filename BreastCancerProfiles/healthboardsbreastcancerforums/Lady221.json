I suspect yours may improve with time as well. Pain with breast cancer is is not a typical symptom its actually less common, most times people feel no pain with their cancer (unless it spreads to other areas of the body) which is why with out self exams we might never catch it. My humble suggestion, ask for some physical therapy, they can help with some safe stretching and exercises that can help improve your back muscles that should also help improve the pain. I know your gonna say how does stretching and exercising my already sore muscles help with pain, well it actually helps the muscles you have not have to work as hard so in turn they hurt less. Hope this helps Kili Thank you for your response. It has improved already. It took 3 months but I do feel better. I had PT and went for chiropractic adjustments. Also, the fact that I didn't have any breast prosthetics didn't help any. Now that I do my balance is better. Thank you for posting. This really scared me. You know how our minds start to wonder.",

      "Content": "Hello everyone, I know many many women have had a breast biopsy but this is my first. I am so frightened. Tomorrow is the day. What worried me was the Dr who looked over my ultrasound. He said he was \"very concerned\" I had a mammogram exactly one year ago and it was fine. Suddenly there is a 4cm lump. I have always been very cysty. Years ago I was told I had 2 areas of what they called neurofibromas on my hand and on my toe. I'm wondering if this could be a breast neurofibroma too. I'm 62 yrs old and have had mammo's yearly. This is a first-time lump. I guess I just need some assurance. They did say my armpit lymph nodes looked good. I hope that's a good thing. Are there any questions I need to ask? What is a biopsy like? I'm so afraid. Thanks for listening. Waiting for results. Had it Friday and had to wait the whole damn weekend. This waiting is excruciating. Can anyone answer why before I felt no lump. The radiologist first said it was at 9-10 oclock. Then when having the biopsy he said 10-11 oclock. Now (I don't know if it's swelling) but I have a hardness at 12 oclock. What is going on? Is this swelling or is this lump moving? It's been 4 days after biopsy. Thank you.",

I can move my arm around/lift my arm but I have pain on the outside of the shoulder and my traps going up to my neck. It worries me about bone cancer. Has anyone had shoulder problems after mastectomy? Is this common?",
