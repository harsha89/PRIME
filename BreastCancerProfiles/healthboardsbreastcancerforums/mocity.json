    "Content": "I am not a doc but have been on the breast cancer ride since May 2008. BRAC1 and BRAC2 are totally different than HER2+. I did the BRAC testing due to a very strong family history. I tested negative. HER2+ is part of the pathology. For example, after my bi lateral mastectomy the pathology report came back and showed me that I am ER+ (Estrogen), PR+ (Progesterone) and HER2+. Those three indicators help explain what your cancer is feeding from and what type of treatment will be best for you in the future. Testing for HER2 is not genetic testing like the BRAC1 and BRAC2..... Just my 2 cents Good luck to your mom!",
