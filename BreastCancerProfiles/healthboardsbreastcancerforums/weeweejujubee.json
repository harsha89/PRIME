On the other hand, it could be a cyst, my husband had a cyst near his breast that was there for 3 years and it finally (with help from the doc) came out. Do you have a harry chest? Sorry don't mean to be so personal but could be ingrown hair that is very infected.",

      "Content": "If you are in the habit of doing monthly breast self exams when young you'll have a better chance of finding something that wasn't there the month before. Most breasts are lumpy but from my experience lumps are usually hard or they could feel like the bird seed under the skin. But no matter what if YOU are worried about anything going on with your body keep going back to the doctor ... be very pro active.",
