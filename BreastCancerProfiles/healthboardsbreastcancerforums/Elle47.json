Hi there, I am just starting out antibiotics from my second breast abscess. I tried antibiotics the last time (last June) and then had to have it cut out. they did a biopsy and it was a bacteria (I think it was staph) and not cancer. I am upset that it came back and curious too about why it is happening. Someone told me that we carry staph bugs in our noses and to put a topical antibiotic in my nose every day for a while and I would quit getting infections. I have been doing that just in case. Let me know if you find out anything. thanks. take care. Elle",
