      "Content": "Hi all-- please excuse my silly screen name-- last time I posted on HealthBoards, it was several years ago when I was having bunion surgery on my foot! I went today for my first mammogram, and wasn't at all worried about it-- I'm very healthy with no history of breast cancer in my family. They ended up taking a magnification mammogram of my right breast, as the radiologist detected microcalcifications. Again, I didn't think anything of it, and when the tech showed me the image, I didn't even know what questions to ask. I did not know these can sometimes indicate a pre-cancer condition. I don't remember how many there were, but it was definitely more than 5 and they were all in the same area. The radiologist recommended coming back in 6 months for another mammogram and he wrote on my little check out sheet \"probably benign.\" So then I went back to work and looked on Google and you know how that goes. It can send you into a panic. I am reading that some people say you should have a biopsy when these are found, and also, that it is uncommon for a woman under 40 to have microcalcifications. My doctor will call me in the next day or two and I want to know what to say to her. Do I go along and wait 6 months for the follow up mammogram or do I request a biopsy? It is confusing. I figured you all would have some insight.",
