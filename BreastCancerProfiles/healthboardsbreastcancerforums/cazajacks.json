      "Content": "Sending you good luck and hugs..... When I had my mamo and something showed up I looked at the picture, then had to have an ultrasound and they did biopsies and what they said was a 'dense area'. I kept this picture of the dense area in my mind, it showed up bright white on the mammogram picture, it was sort of like a bright white circle with prickly edges. I then went home and looked up online 'mammogram photo's of breast cancer' and blow me down there was a photo on the identical to mine, it was a bit of a shock. After waiting a week to see the consultant he went on to tell me I did actually have breast cancer, all very scary but here I am 2 years on and doing well. Everytime I have a mammogram now I ask to see the pic afterwards, they do let me and i search for a bright white area, but not everyone is the same, maybe not everything that shows up white is a cancer. Good luck to both of you xx",

      "Content": "Hi Ruthie, i am a couple of steps ahead of you, i didn't find a lump but a mamogram did, i was called back last week to have another mamogram and an ultrasound and whilst having the ultrasound they suddenly sprang it on me they were going to do 3 'core biopsy's', i almost fainted with the fear, the thought of needles in my boob terrified me. They numbed my boob, about four quick stings and then nothing, even when i heard the noise of the biopsy being taken, (similar to a staple gun) i still didnt feel a thing. They've confirmed it's not a cyst, so now i have to go this coming wednesday to find out if i have breast cancer or if its a fibrous lump. I'm getting more scared as the day gets nearer, my hubby is coming with me for the results, just in case. I never knew i had a lump, but i was there because my other boob felt a bit sore, it is just a lucky coincidence they found the lump in my other breast, or it could have been there for a long long time. So i will sit and panic until next wednesday. Please be reassured that none of my core biopsy hurt, and i am a baby, i cry if i have to have anything medical done, even though i am 46 i am always anxious and hate having anything done to me. So for me to say it didn't hurt is shocking lol. Good luck, let me know how you get on.",

      "Content": "Hi Shelley, first of all, try not to panic, so much easier than said i know but there were hundreds of woman at the hospital with lumps in their breasts and well over 90% were harmless lumps, honestly. I did not feel a lump at all, mine was hidden right at the back of my chest, almost against my ribs. I was very lucky it was picked up on a mamogram. You will need to have a mamogram done, and hopefully they will be able to tell you what the lump is, they are so used to what each lump looks like.. i.e. cysts, cancer etc etc so they often know once they see your mamogram, but they may call you back to do another one and to do some biopsies. My close friend is just going through this right now. She has had about 5 lumps on seperate occasions and has been called back to have them drained/biopsied and all 5 were fine and harmless, but now she has been called back to a bigger hospital after having a mamogram, so she is terrified. they will be able to tell from 2nd mamgram and biospy what the lump is. I hope yours is harmless, but please let me know. Ive just finished all my treatment, had to have 20 sessions of radiotherapy in the end, and now i have heart trouble caused by the chemo, but im still here and im grateful for that. Im still keeping strong , well as best i can, and im still smiling, but i do cry, im not that strong, as cancer is so very scary, it terrifies me. Keep in touch and ask absolutely anything you want to honey. Good Luck, Carolyn.",

      "Content": "Hi there, so sorry ive not posted for such a long time, how are you doing, please update me. I had my op on 12th April taken away my tumour and 4 lymph nodes, lymph nodes were clear and so was the outer area around the tumour so i was very please with all that and celebrated being cancer free. Then at my next appointment they told me i had the most aggressive type of cancer and it could have gone somewhere else in my body, only the small cells but this means i had to go on to have chemotherapy. I have just had my 3rd round of chemo today and its been a horrible experience for me. I have had every single side effect going, spent a lot of time in hospital, gone bald within 2 and a halft weeks, have a very sore itchy rash over back/neck/chest/head and privates and they said this is a hair folicle infection, severe thrush both mouth and below, constipation very bad, then caught a diahorrea virus so was really ill with that. when i have chemo i have to have steriods, (everyone does) but boy the side effect of coming off of them were awful, i had awful nightmares, but when i woke up i was halicinating and the nightmares were still there in my bedroom with me, it was terrifying. I eyesight went so blurred i could not see, and my hearing went very quiet. But this was the steriods not the chemo, so now even thought the dr said not to i reduce them more slowly than they tell me to and its not so bad. I spend a week in hospital after every chemo as i get Neutrapenic Sepsis which is a very serious thing to caught, caused by too much chemo. My feet go numb, and i my bowel stops working, i have never felt so unwell and no one warned me about all this. I really don't want to frighten you but you've probably had your chemo by now, and only about 20% of people having chemo get it this bad, im just one of the unlucky ones im afraid. Its made me feel very low, i can't get out of bed hardly i can't wash nor dress myself, life is lousy feeling like this, but i only have one more session to go thank God. Please do not let you or anyone reading this put you off chemo as i have just been very unlucky, most of the people at the hospital were doing great, still working and doing everyday things, as i said its just me thats had it this bad. Now they are talking to me about have 3 weeks of intensive radio therapy once my chemo ends, i wish they had told me this before as they did actually tell me i did not need radiotherapy?? can't wait for it all to finish, but what worries me as i have got grade 3 cancer the aggressive one, they have told me its more than likely to come back, so that really frightens me. I asked them how would i know, but they said until i get symptoms i wont' know. I didnt have any symptoms with my breast cancer, no lump nothing so i worry that by the time i get any symptoms it could be untreatable. I hope you are doing better than me, do let me know how things have progressed. I wish you loads of luck and send lots of hugs, Cazajacks.",

I have slight damage to my heart (pericarditis) which they think has been caused by the chemo. Finished all my treatment last mid November. I am expected to go back to work next month, but dont feel well enough, but i have no choice, or i will lose my home as my pay has been completely stopped. I feel so exhausted all the time, no energy what so ever. But i do feel good otherwise, people would never know what ive been through if it wasnt for my short hair, yes i am no longer bald lo.. I would love to hear how your all doing xx",
