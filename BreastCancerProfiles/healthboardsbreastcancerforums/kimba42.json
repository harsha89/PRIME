I found a lump at the beginning of July that was spindle-shaped and attached. Since I was going on vacation at the middle of July, I was on the cancellation list, but I couldn't get the mammo then US scheduled until last week then today. From what I could tell by what the radiologist told the techs, the microcalcifications were stable and a cyst they found in 2003 is stable. However, he agreed with my doc that I needed the US. Today, the tech doing my US found cysts in the breast, but not the lump that my doctor and I felt. She found them all around the place. To me, the lump feels very deep and the cysts are closer to the surface. Now what? My doc told me that US and mommogram doesn't always pick up the lumps. Am I looking at some kind of biopsy now? What have you all experienced in this case? I'm uncomfortable about them not being able to find the lump and I know it's there. Help!!!! Any insight you have is welcome. I see my doc tomorrow. Thanks, Elaine",

      "Content": "I had an US done on Friday and I have a lump which is 9mm and they couldn't find it. THey have problems with me though because I have had a bilateral breast reduction and have vety thick scarring. So the only way they are going to figure out what is going on with me is for them to do a biopsy. Hopefully they will find out what it is. Good Luck! Have they tried an MRI yet, if not see if you can get one, the pictures are very clear, I actually viewed mine when I came home. KIM",
