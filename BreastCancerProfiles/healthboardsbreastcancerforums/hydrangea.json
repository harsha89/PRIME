    "Content": "Just had my first mammo and it showed a cluster of 6 to 7 microcalcs. I had stereotactic biopsy today and they found there were actually 20 to 25 in that cluster. Some apparently didn't show on mammo. I get results tomorrow and I am really worried. Does this number of microcalcifications indicate a higher likelihood of cancer, and if so what type? I'm struggling to keep positive and kicking myself for not getting a mammogram at age 40. What do you think?",
