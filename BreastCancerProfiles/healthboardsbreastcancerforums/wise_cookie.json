      "Content": "Well.....I had the biopsy done on my right breast on July 9th. They had to take me to xray first for them to put a wire in to guide the surgeon to the calcification area. They put me in the mammogram machine and while I was in there the xray doc came in and gave me lidocane and then place a wire. They took another xray with this wire in and decided it wasn't in the right place! They took it out and started over! Needless to say this wasn't comfortable regardless of the fact they gave me lidocane. Afterwards they took me to surgery with the wire still in. I woke up in some kind of pain!!!! They let me go home that afternoon. They told my sister (whom was with me thru all this) that they looked at the specimen under the microscope but couldn't determine anything. They told her that the pathologist would have to study it more closely and would know something in a few days. I've been going crazy over this....and talking about being in some kind of pain!!! I am bruised beyond belief and my breast looks awful. I called the doctor's office this past Wednesday and naturally he was in surgery and wasn't going to be in the office until late yesterday afternoon. I told the lady that I was going crazy with worry and would appreciate it if they would call me with my results. She said that she understood and would get them to call the next day. Well.......yesterday afternoon at 4pm I got the call. It was the surgeon's nurse and she stated that the report said that the cells were \"atypical\". In other words not normal but they weren't exactly malignant either. She said I wouldn't need more surgery and asked when my appointment was. I told her it was this coming Monday and she said that they would discuss everything in more detail then. She then said that I would have to go see and oncologist and probably have to take some medication for a while. Now I am totally confused and still worried! If it's not cancer then why am I going to have to go to an oncologist and take medication??? I have imagined that perhaps my doctor doesn't really allow his nurse to tell me over the phone too much information? Has anyone else had this type of experience? Can someone please respond if so? I'm still scared and would really like to hear from anyone that might could ease my mind about all of this. Thanks, wise_cookie",

My doctor called to tell me that they showed 2 calcifications and he was sending me to a surgeon for a biopsy. I saw the surgeon and he has me set up for a biopsy on July 9th. I am going crazy worrying about this. I appreciate your story as it helps to inform me at least.",
