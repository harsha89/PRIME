    "Content": "Two months ago I was seen as I had spontaneous brown bloody nipple discharge from my left breast. Went for mammogram and ultrasound, and only a cyst was found that did not appear cancerous. A few weeks later went for a ductogram with a doctor who thought he found the right duct, checked it and told me it was a tiny short duct which did not have anything going on with it and deemed me cancer free, but told me if it worsens, I need to get rechecked. Three weeks later now, I looked down at my left breast and noticed a bright red spot in another area of the nipple, gently squeezed it, and now I have bright red blood from another duct and the same brown in the other. Is this worth mentioning? Does anyone know what could cause this in just one breast? I was so happy that I was given a cancer-free unless it worsens diagnosis that it didn't bother me that no one told me what could be causing the issue, but now that it is spreading, I am wondering if anyone else has experienced something similar? Thank you.",
