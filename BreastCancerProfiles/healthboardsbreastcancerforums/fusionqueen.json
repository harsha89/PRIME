    "Content": "Hello, My sister-in-law went in for her first mamogram in January. She is 40. After a very long ordeal and a doc change they have done a double mastectomy and removed 6 lymphnodes on one side. They found 2 very small......... 1 cm and 2 cm DCIS they thought...........the 1cm ended up being invasive. The lymph results came back as all 6 were cancerous. Now 2 weeks later she is going in to tomorrow to have her 1st and 2 tier axillary nodes removed. Can anyone PLEASE explain to me what these tiers are? Also what stage this would be? Everything I read points to stage 3 except the tumor size. They have done a bone scan,MRI, CAT scan,upper GI and other tests yesterday, but the results are not back yet. She has a 2 and 4 year old. So sad! Again I would appreciate any input anyone can give me on what this all means. I am lost!!",
