    "Content": "I saw a thread regarding this, and perhaps i should have posted there. I am a 31 mother of 3, strong family history of Breast Cancer, and this last weekend doing an exam found a lump and blackish discharge from one duct, and bloody from another. I have noticed a wet feeling on my underclothes in the recent past, but never have noticed any spontaneous discharge. I have a mammogram on monday and docs appt immediately following. I have also had some extreme fatigue, and an elevated thyroid which my doc says can be triggered by hormone levels. Im a bit nervous, monday is right around the corner, i dont know what im asking for, more i guess for some information, and seeing what else it could be. Thanks for any advice, its all welcome!!!
