      "Content": "I'm a 47 year old, pre-menopausal women. My yearly mammogram showed a \"density\" which they needed to investigate further. I had an ultrasound done today on my right breast. Consensus on results was that it is \"most likely\" a cyst, very small and it kept moving as they passed the wand around the breast (which a tumor wouldn't do). They suggested a followup mammo and ultrasound in 6 months. I'm pretty much ok with that, I'm well educated about these things, however, there is a small nagging voice in my head. The reason for the voice is my mom died from breast cancer and it was very aggressive. From diagnosis until her demise, if I remember correctly it was less than 2 years. And she originally was given a very good prognosis but apparently this thing went haywire, which they had not expected. I know that cysts pretty much NEVER turn into cancer however, since the doctor at the facility did not say \"definitly\" a cyst, I'm wondering if I should have some kind of other follow-up on the matter. I never felt a lump, nor did my GYN (I had my yearly only a few months back). The \"density\" is buried quite deeply in my breast, they had a difficult time finding it w/the ultrasound. I imagine even if a breast surgeon wanted to aspirate it as a precaution, it might be a difficult thing to reach. But of course, I'm no expert Anyway, has anyone been through this or know the correct protocal to follow? I already called my doctor to discuss this further with her (after all she knows my family history better than the diagnostic center). Thanks! Laurie",

      "Content": "Thank you so much for your lengthy response. I think you are doing the right thing for sure. I called my doctor's office late yesterday, spoke to the nurse for a while and she's having my doctor call me today to discuss this further. I have already decided that I'd like to see a breast surgeon, better to put this in the hands of an expert. BTW, my mom's cancer also matastized, to her bones, everywhere. That was what eventually killed her. She did have radiation however, and had been in remission for less than a year when she started having severe hip pains. That's when they discovered the cancer had spread and was eating away at her bones. Thanks again and best of luck to you! Keep us posted! Laurie",
