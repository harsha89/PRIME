He said a lot of times this is the type of call back you get if the pictures were unclear or they just want to compare something to be sure to rule something out. Ever since the call now I feel a lump on the left side. It seems to feel a little like a small rubbery thing. It moves around all over the place. Now I am scared. Has anyone gone through this?? Please respond. Thanks! Barb Hi Barb, I'm going through the samething. I had my mammogram done on 1/19/07 and I just received a call this past friday stating I needed a diagnostic mammogram on my right breast and an ultrasound. The kicker is they give me an appt for 3/14/07. So I'm going crazy. They claim the right breast didn't come out clear. But If they didnt see something why not just redo the mammogram? Am I crazy? So I do know how you're feeling.I'll pray for you",

      "Content": "Hi everyone. On 1/19/07 I had a mammogram on 2/9/07 I receive a phone call stating I need a diagnostic of my right breast and an ultrasound. Now, they claim that the right breast didn't come out too good. but the tech checked the images before I left and unless they found something why not just repeat the mammogram? Why the diagnostic and the ultrasound?Plus they expect me to wait until 3/14/07 to get this done. I'm worried and slowly going crazy. Any information will be appreciated. Thanks for listening.",
