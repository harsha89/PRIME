      "Content": "Hi Maple I have never had breast cancer. My own cancer was a rare one called myxoid liposarcoma. However, my mom did have breaast cancer and my Pop passed away from lung cancer. Mom and Pop were diagnosed within a week of each other 12 years ago. I was diagnosed 11 years ago myself. Okay, I shared that only because cancer my life has been filled in many ways with cancer and I have learned some about the treatments as both a caretaker and a patient. And I just wanted to share somethings I learned along the way. Long before my mom's breast cancer treatment, it was routine for patients with breast cancer to have 12 rounds of chemo. Along the way, some patients just could not habdle all the treatments and stopped at ten. When research showed that these patients had a good survival rate, ten rounds of chemo became the standard. This kind of pattern repeated itself and by the time my mom was treated, the recommended number of rounds of chemo was down to 6. I don't know where it stands today. It takes a lot of interaction between doctors and patients to come to decisions when in treatment and ultimately a patient makes the decision as to how much treatment is bearable. From these decisions, data is collected, researched, studied and routines change. At the time of my own rare cancer, there were no studies of what effect if any, chemo had in helping patients like myself. I was prescribed 6 rounds and it was a very powerful protocol called MAID. After two rounds, I knew in my gut that the chemo was gouing to destroy me, physically and mentally. I told my doctor I would go for a total of four rounds and no more. I was willing to take a chance for quality of life and hope and pray for quantity also. So I only had four rounds. I was part of a follow up study as the clinic where I received treatment at Mass General Hospital has a Sarcoma clinic and were beginning to study sarcopmas more thorughly and routinely. I don't know where the routine is at this point for those diagnosed with the particular cancer I had, but would not be surprised to find that fewer rounds of MAID are now used or that the MAID protocol iteslf is now outdtaed after research data has been studied. So, it does not surprise me to read about your friend. If she has any comcerns, I would suggest she just outright ask the doctor to share the research with her and find out the success rate with this particular routine and method. She has every right as a patient to understand and question why a particular treatment pattern is being used. It is so vital that we are totally proactive in our treatment plans and that we have understanding of everythingbeing done and the whys of each thing. I wasn't happy about being a 'guinea pig' of sorts, but we deal from where we are in life at the moment. When I talked to my own doctor about my concerns, he was very willing to listen and shared openly and honestly with me. Best,best wishes to your friend. And to you... you are a wonderful friend to care about another human so dearly. reachout",

Sometimes I have to share ugly things about my own cancer experience, and sometimes I get to share little details like this. Whatever I share, it is a bit of a way for me to give back what I was given in my own time of need. Maybe you would share one more thing with your friend for me? Please let her know that I understand that for this time in her life, she is defined a great deal by her cancer. That is a sad truth, but a truth we must recognize because we need to in order to survive. However, I want her to know that this changes in time. In time, we are once again defined by who we are as a whole human being. Oh, the cancer will always be a partr of the definition of us to some degree, but more pleasants aspects of our essence come back with strength again. Will you share that with her? Thank you reachout",

      "Content": "Hello Sandra Both my mom and I had radiation .... my mom for breast cancer, me for a sarcoma in the thigh. On the first visit, they will find your exact position on the table.. just like a table in a doctor's office. On me, they put four little permamnent blue dots to show where the radiation would be hitting. I don't know if they did this on my mom. The first visit is always the longest as they need to determine the position of your body... they will know for all the next visits. To me, the radiation room always made me feel like I was in the Starship Enterprise... lots of stainless stell and gadgets. Smiles. Once we are set up in position, the radiation is given. You will not feel anything at all. You will only know it is over because they will tell you... only takes a very shrot few minutes. Getting undressed and then dressed again takes the most time. As the treatment goes on, you may start to feel fatigued. This is normal and will go away in a while after treatments end. Also, as the treatments go on, some have some skin burning to the breast area that is radiated. My mom had very, very little. There are great creams the doctors will give you that help tremendously. If for any resaon you have pain with any burning, the doctors will also provide pain relief meds. I know it is frightening, Honey. However, I think after your very first visit you will see that it really is not horrific or anything. I have never found any radiation staff to be anything but greatly caring and supportive. One nurse actually used to put my shoes and socks back on me after a treatment. I told her I could do it, but she said that everyone in treatment deserves a bit of pampering. Sweet, huh? That's how all the staff was for both my mom and me and we were in different facilities. Rest easy about this and be peacful. It is a measure to ensure your health and is a good thing. Keep us posted Hugs reach",

Because of the symptoms you have described and because breast cancer runs in your family, I would say that if you can get in sooner, then do it. At the very least, to help allay your anxiety. There is a very rare cancer called Inflammatory Breast Cancer. Your symptoms could point to that OR just be a skin problem or infection of some type. Because IBC is so rare, chances are greater that it is not that. However, like you, I would also be anxious and certainly understand that you are. Call your doctor and just be honest about your concern and see what he can do about that scheduling. Please update us. Until then, I will certainly hold you up in prayer. Hugs reach",

There are some that actually specialize in breast issues, but even if that specialty is not available, see a regular oncologist. You absolutely need to have a biopsy done. Request it and stand your ground. We need to be our own best health advocate and this is just too serious a possibility to be in slow mode here. Of course you are worried about IBC! The only way that worry is going to be put to rest is when a doctor familiar with IBC examines you. Get proactive today and get an oncologist in the loop here. Rooting for you reach",

Good for you for moving forward. :-) I have found myself in a stalled mode about a test because of fear.

I know this all too well and here is why: 3 months or so ago, I developed red, itchy patches on one breast and a few days later on the other breast. The patches were rough and wrinkled as well as itchy. Put my symptoms into a search and what do you think came up?? Yep, IBC. I had never even heard of it before. Having survived a different type of cancer some years before, and seeing as my mom had had breast cancer, I wasn't messing around. I saw my oncologist pronto. He gave me some cream and said if it did not improve or if it got worse within three days to come back for more tests. In 3 days it was clearing up nicely. Some kind of freaky derma stuff. My worry had been for naught. :-) However, I am glad I went quickly and and was able to get some peace in a short time. Keeping you in my heart and mind until you get some resolution here.

It could be a node that swells during ovulation or just before your period. (I used to get a huge swelling every month right before my period and it was in my armpit of all places!) It could be a benign cyst or a fatty tumor ( also a benign thing). It could be from caffeine! ( my friend had swellings in her breast, had them biopsied, they were benign. Her doctor, a naturalist, told her to get off the coffee as this could be causing the swellings... sure enough, she did and the swellings disppeared for good). It could be something serious. Don't fool around. Get to the doctor and have it checked. It is something that should cause concern and it obviously is. Smiles.
