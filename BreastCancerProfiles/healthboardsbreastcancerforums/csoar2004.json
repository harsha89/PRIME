I'm wondering if your daughter recently started menstruating, because this type of thing is usually associated with hormones (hence the prolactin test). By doing a google search, I found the following info: Quote: Only 10% of cases of nipple discharge are due to papilloma or cancer. Problems or disorders of the nipple are common and can be worrying, but changes are rarely due to cancer. If discharge is new and appears on one side only this needs a clinical examination and a mammogram. The most common cause is duct ectasia, but cancer needs to be excluded. ...A profuse, spontaneous, watery or bloodstained discharge from nipple or surrounding areola: This needs investigation, usually with microscopic examination (cytology) of the discharge and a mammogram. This may indicate a benign duct papilloma (a growth similar to a wart) or occasionally cancer. The majority of women with nipple discharge do not have breast cancer. Mammary duct ectasia is a benign lesion of the breast that consists of dilation of the mammary ducts, periductal fibrosis, and inflammation. This entity has been described in infants, prepubertal boys and girls, as well as adult men and women. The patient presents with nipple discharge, which may be bloody in nature. In children and adolescents, the lesion is usually unilateral. Infectious and inflammatory causes have been implicated in the etiology of this finding. Ultrasonographic findings are usually suggestive, showing dilated mammary ducts radially located around the nipple. The process is usually self-limited; therefore, surgery is not recommended if the diagnosis is certain (Kitahara, 2002). Here's a link that may help: [url]http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&dopt=A bstract&list_uids=21275791[/url] If I were you, given your familial history of breast cancer, I'd get on the phone to doctor and find out a) when the appointment with specialist is and b) what ultrasound results show (for instance, though no lumps may have been found, were the mammary ducts dilated near the nipple as in ductal ectasia?) and c) what were the results of the swab test, and d) should the consult be with a breast surgeon/oncologist (because of history of breast cancer in direct female line)? Mammary duct ectasia, from my google findings, is grossly underdiagnosed. While I'm not saying that's what your daugher has, if she were my daughter, I'd be morphed into guard/advocate momma-from-doctor's-worst-nightmare and demanding answers. But that's me. Hope this helps. best wishes, charli 203/146/146 on the Fat Flush Plan for life and perky. Veddy, veddy perky",

      "Content": "an oncologist and a breast specialist are NOT the same thing. Depending upon your insurance, you may not need a referral from your general practice doc in order to see the breast specialist. Are you in the US? Because if you ARE, call up your doctor and explain how much this situation has upset you and tell him you would feel much better if you could get a second opinion from a breast specialist. IMHO, they'll give you one under the circumstances (UNLESS you are in an HMO OR you are in a country with socialized medicine where the gate to specialists is under very tight control). Chances are your doc is correct and the lump is benign and not a problem. But I understand your concern. Good luck",

Call the nearest planned parenthood and ask them where they refer their patients for breast lump evaluations. Typically, breast specialists are OB/gyns. You can also call up the local radiology/mammography group and ask them for names of local breast specialists. You're not asking for a recommendation from these sources, mind you. Just a list of local breast specialists. Got m'fingers crossed for ya!",

      "Content": "Quote: Originally Posted by Galsal59 Has anyone had a breast mass with a microlobulated margin that turned out to be benign? Thanks! Well, I haven't. But I have found some info that might help you: Quote: One has to rely upon an array of findings to evaluate solid breast lesions and call it benign or malignant. No characteristics are absolutely specific and it is impossible to distinguish all benign from all solid breast nodules using sonographic criteria. However sonographic criteria to be looked for are : Shape and margin of the lesion : The shape of a mass can be described as round, oval, lobulated or irregular. Round and oval shapes are suggestive of benign masses. As long as there are fewer than three lobulations, the chances of malignancy is very less. The presence of greater than three lobulations is an indeterminate feature. Irregular shape is suspicious of malignancy. The margin of the lesion reflects the demarcation of the mass with surrounding tissue. It can be smooth, microlobulated, irregular or spiculated. Gentle bilobulated or trilobulated margins are considered smooth. Presence of 2 or 3 gentle smooth, circumscribed and well-encapsulated lobulation strongly favours a benign etiology over cancer. The presence of many small lobulations, that is microlobulations, on surface of solid breast lesion is suspicious of malignancy. Numerous lobulations give the lesion a pleomorphic shape. Microlobulations are frequently associated with angular margins. and this one: Quote: Invasive breast carcinoma According to the study of Rahbar (3) 2D US features that characterize lesions as malignant are irregular shape (61% malignant), microlobulated (67% malignant), spiculated (67% malignant) and a width-to-depth (anteroposterior dimension) ratio of 1.4 or less (40% malignant). Most of the time the tumor center is characterized by a homogenous echo-poor fibrohyalinosis followed by a dorsal shadowing due to ultrasound energy absorption. The echo-rich margins are the expression of many different tissue components of tumor cells, fibrous strands, fatty tissue and surrounding glandular parenchyma indicating the tumorous growth and infiltration zone. Mammography clearly shows this stellate infiltration pattern with the architectural distortion of the neighbouring structures. What I'm finding is that a microlobulated margin of a breast lesion seems to show a two thirds likelihood of malignancy. Benign findings occur about 1/3 of the time. I'm hoping you are in the 1/3 category, sal. best wishes, ____________________________ charli 203/146/146 on the Fat Flush Plan for life and perky to the max.",

      "Content": "Quote: Originally Posted by windchase168 Well, I know it's odd for a male to come here to ask a question. But I really need some advice. I have a few questions. (1) Would you follow the instruction of the doctor to wait another month before doing anything? (2) Is it really true that an ultrasound can't tell anything? (3) I heard if a male has breast cancer, it would be at the location where my lump is. What might it be if the lump is benign? Thank you. 1) No. Male breast cancer is diagnosed in later stages precisely because patient/provider wait too long (embarrassment factor?). Seek a second opinion - from a breast specialist (yah, there IS such an animal) and trust me, while women make up the majority of their patients, they see men, too! 2) No. Believe it or not, diagnostic mammography is generally the first tool used for men as well as women, but ultrasounds are a close second. 3) check out National Institutes of Health male breast cancer page: http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/malebreastcancer.html and click on \"breast problems in men\" for a quickie decision tree to give you an idea about what it might be if benign. The above are simply my opinions, you understand. But from my research, it seems to me that a smooth hard lump beneath your nipple is cause for concern and risk factors (family history of breast cancer in the women of your family, for example) can contribute to your personal risk. Ask your doctor for a referral to a breast specialist (or if your insurance doesn't require it, then refer yourself directly to one). best wishes! ________________ 203/146/150 on the Fat Flush Plan for life and perky to the max!",
