I've had a lot of procedures done in my life, but this one is extremely new to me. When I spoke to the nurse who called, it sounds as if they are going to do a Incisional biopsy and take a small part of the lump. They are also going to do an ultrasound at the same time as the biopsy. She told me she was pretty sure I would be under a local anesthesia during the process. For those of you who have experienced this can you tell me what to expect? And what to expect afterwards? Ok, I cant speak for myself since I have not gone through this (yet!) but I did go with my daughter last year for what sounds similar to what you are saying(?). I think they told her it was a core biopsy (meaning: they would take a small part and send to lab). I can tell you from my just having gone with her what took place. We waited in the waiting room, then was taken into another room with an older very nice lady tech who asked my daughter questions and filled out a form. We then went into the back where she changed into a gown for the top and left her jeans on...kept her clothes in the little locker in the room she changed in. She was then called in to the room where the lights were dimmed down a bit while I sat literally outside that door. I looked at my watch and I kid you not it was exactly 11 minutes and she was out and getting her shirt back on! From what she told me they laid her on the table, yes there was a sonogram or something that they went by as they did the procedure....they did numb her and she said that was a slight sting/burning feel then one more time they moved it in a bit further and she felt another sting/burn and then hold breath and clip and done. Two small stitches that absorbed on their own and call back or wait for results. She was perfectly fine and I forget now what they called it. I remember when I went in with her to get her shirt back on she was shaking tremendously but it was NOTHING she said honestly and loved the doctor who did it...she was great! Only reason she was shaking so bad is because being a woman and having something done at that area was just overwhelming and I believe I may be doing the same thing But I must remember HOW FAST it was and how great they were. You will be ok....I wish you luck...and if you are nervous just be sure to let them know that...good luck with it and keep us posted Hugs*",
