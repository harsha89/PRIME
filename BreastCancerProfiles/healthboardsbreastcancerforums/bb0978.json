      "Content": "Hi I am 26 years old & felt a lump about a month ago (yeah I know, I thought it might just disappear) so I went to the doc & she ordered an ultrasound. I had that done this morning. The doctor came in & checked it out for size & he said that he thought it was a fibroadenoma or even a small lymp node but to make sure I need to have a needle biopsy done. I'm scared. Chances are is that it is benign & if that is the case do I still need to have an operation to get it removed? its only 18 x 15 x 6mm & is not innterupting the breast architecutre and is of mildly decreased echogenticity. Can you tell I read the report? My doc isn't available for another 4 days so once I go there I'll have to be rebooked for the needle thing I guess. Can anyone offer me any words of wisdom? Thanks.",
