    "Content": "I had some very slight drops of red blood from one breast. My dr says I have a 3.4 dilated milk duct in my breast based on a mamo and ultra sound. She does not seem overly concerned as I have no family history of breast cancer but she wants to do a \"major duct excision.\" I am reluctant and and have been looking for alternatives. I have no other symptoms and have had no bleeding for over a month. Any suggestions?",
