    "Content": "I had a routine mammogram 6 months ago and they found a mass. So same day did an ultrasound. Results said it was probably binine so to follow up with another mammogram in June. I was getting ready to schedule it when I noticed the lump has gotten bigger and it seems to show in the skin. No discoloration but almost swollen looking exactly where the lump is. Is this something I should be concerned with? If the lump wasn't cancerous before could it be now? I'm always tired and get worn out easily in the last month or so. So scared any suggestions?",
