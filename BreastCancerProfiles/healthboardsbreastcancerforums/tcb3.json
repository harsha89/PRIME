    "Content": "I went to the doctor (GP) for pain in my right breast. She did an exam refered me to a Breast care facility for an Ultrasound. After the technician did the ultrasound she said that the Radiologist would want to see me before I changed. I waited and when he returned, be did the ultrasound again and hit the spot that hurt when pressed. He showed me the black spot on the screen and said that it was not fluid filled, that he was not sure at the time as to what to determine it. He said that it would need to be biopsied and I should call my GP's office as I left his to ensure that the appointment with the surgeon was made soon. Couldn't think then, but now my head is spinning. What could all of this be?",
