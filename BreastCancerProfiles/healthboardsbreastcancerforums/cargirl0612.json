    "Content": "I am also facing the same dilemma of going through radiation and possibly chemo. My tumor was between 2 - 3 cm with clear margins and lymph nodes. I just had the lumpectomy and lymph node biopsy on Tuesday. My surgeon said I might be eligible for the balloon catheter type radiation called mammosite. My understanding is that the long and short term side effects are less severe and the treatment time is twice a day for 5 days. My surgeon also said that because I'm so young (I'm 31) an oncologist will probably suggest chemo as well. I don't understand what the point is behind that. I guess it's a question for the oncologist. I'm more afraid that I'll die or have my life shortened from the treatments rather than the cancer itself because of their toxic effects on the body.",
