      "Content": "Hi Louise, Wow! I wonder how many other women with breast cancer have had some stomach problems! I felt the same as you about the stomach issues....just getting old, menapause coming...etc. But now I am finding out things such as - if you don't digest food and waste properly, there is estrogen that stays in your system to cause more problems! That was enough for me to start eating more bran cereal and taking more flax! It seems to help, at least for now. But I will be thinking and praying for you next week Louise. I hope it will all go well. Take Care, Terry",

I discovered my breast cancer, years of mammograms and ultrasounds never saw it. Thankfully my doctor listened to me and I had the bioposy and MRI and there it was. You know your body better than anyone else. Please take care and good luck. Terry",

      "Content": "HI Louise, I don't mind discussing my situation at all. My breast cancer was identified finally in my right breast. That was where the itching began, but itching also occurred in my left breast, later. I also had alot of tingling sensations in both breasts. I had two biopsies on my right breast. They found a second spot after an ultrasound. But the real test that showed what was going on was the MRI. Cancer shows up as white spots on the image. I had three cancer spots in my right breast (they never showed up on a mammogram). But my left breast showed alot of white areas which were not identified as cancer - but changing. From my view, it looked no different than the right breast and felt exactly the same. My surgeon believed we would need to keep close watch on that left side, if I did nothing. I did not want that ticking time bomb. I have a 10 year old son and two daughters in college. My breast surgeon - a wonderful woman friend, said she would have done the same. My cancer was estrogen and progesteron positive, which basically means I had too much estrogren in my system. With outside influences of estrogen (foods we eat - especially soy) as well as menopausal symptoms (some hot flashes and infrequent periods) - my body reacted. I was also having some stomach and digestion problems in my early 40s which I still wonder if they don't relate somehow. I am hopeful with some diet changes and continued exercise (I have always been a runner) - I will be ok. If you have any other questions, please feel free to ask. I would be happy to try and help if I can. Take Care, Terry",

      "Content": "Hi Louise, I also had itching a year before I found a lump. I thought it was an irritation that resulted from my running. The itching subsided so I did nothing. Plus I religiously went for mammograms since I was 40 and nothing was uncovered. Then I found the lump. Ultrasound and mammograms still showed nothing! Only the biopsy did. I had an MRI after that and ultimately had a bilateral mastectomy and have just finished 6 rounds of chemotherapy. I will always wonder what would have been, if I would have followed up on the itching or if the mammogram would have showed something. They say that by the time you actually feel something, it could have been growing for 5-10 years! Good Luck to you, and I am so glad you are going to get it checked out. My thoughts and prayers are with you! Terry",

      "Content": "Hi Allic52, This decision is so personal. I know how scared you must feel right now. It is difficult when all of the discussion about ridding cancer from your body is wrapped up with a cosmetic surgery. It is a wonderful option that was not available even a short time ago. But, I am of the belief that if you feel too rushed in making this decision - you can do it at any time down the road. I know this does not help make your decision, but you do have choices. I personally had a bilateral mastectomy last October and chose to recover and heal from that first. For me, I wanted to recover and heal from cancer surgery first and look at the reconstruction on its own merit. As of today, I'm still thinking. I wish you the best and keep us posted. I think it's wonderful to hear how other women made their way through this. Please take care. Terry",

      "Content": "Hi Allic, For me it took a good six weeks to feel relatively normal. Range of motion came back completely, a couple weeks after that. I had a second surgery that slowed my recovery down a bit (I had to have additional lymph nodes removed). Do the exercises they give you for physical therapy....it does work and if you don't you can backslide. Things improved daily, for me, right after surgery. I had been very active before surgery and moved around alot during the day anyway. I tried to do as much as I could but needed help for a couple weeks with the reaching and lifting. The bruising feeling around my rib cage has pretty much gone away but my doctor did tell me that could linger up to a year. I then think I just have that numbness across my chest that will be there forever. That is a bit hard, but I physically feel very well now (I am at the 6 month mark after surgery). I have also just finished 6 rounds of chemotherapy (no radiation). That tires me out early now, but hopefully will improve as well. I try to stay active, and exercise regularly (as well as eat right ) I think those all help in the healing process. I wish you all the best, take care. I hope this helps Terry",

Quite frankly I am feeling like I don't want to take it. I had a bilateral mastectomy last October, no radiation, followed by 6 rounds of chemotherapy. I have been reading some of the side effects and they are starting to scare me more than ever. I never did well on birth control pills and I am thinking I may not do this....I would greatly appreciate any thoughts.... Thank you Terry",

I was not able to produce any, but my doctor said many women can. She told me that was another less invasive way to see if anything abnormal may be going on in your breasts. Hope that helps, Terry",

I have dense breast tissue and nothing ever showed up. I found a lump when I was 48 that did not show up on any mammogram or even an ultrasound. Please know it still could be nothing! I hope and pray it is, but you can still request a biopsy or even an MRI to be sure. I kept trying to talk myself out of what I was feeling...like you, maybe my mind was playing tricks on me.
