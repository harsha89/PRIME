    "Content": "Hi, When I was in my mid 20s, I went to the doctor because I had a really sore lump in one of my breasts. He also said it most likely was nothing because it hurt. He, however, did have it removed as it was the size of a small plum. It turned out benign and was a cyst. I hope yours turns out to be nothing also. I would get two other opinions if you are not comfortable with what your doctor told you. I think implants have problems of their own also. It's your body and you have more of a vested interest in it than a doctor who is a stranger. Good Luck and God Bless.",
