    "Content": "You know a good book for finding the facts while your waiting for your appointment is Dr. Susan Love's Breast Book, she is one of the top breast cancer doctors in the US, i know how stressfull it is waiting to talk to your doctor. It also taught me how to cope with having breast cancer. Since i read her book iv been living a much richer life, and iv gone on several strong women summits, that teaches women that we are strong enough to handle anything, including breast cancer. I recommend the summits to all of you, check them out at strongwomen.com",
