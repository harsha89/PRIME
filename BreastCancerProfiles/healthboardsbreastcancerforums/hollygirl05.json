      "Content": "Hi, I always get itchy breast too. My breast have been itchy for a few months now, and the last 5 days I have been having a little rash on my right breast. It kind of looks like little pimples but they aren't. My right breast also looks like the peel of an orange. I don't have any dimpling or lumps that I can see. I'm going to my doctor on the 16th for my results of my pap and pelvic ultrasound. I'll ask her about it. I believe I may be going through early memopause, although my doctor say's I'm too young. But I feel that I am, and us women, know our bodys. Becky",

      "Content": "Hi, I'm really sorry to hear about that. My mother in law was diagnosed last year with ovarian cancer. The doctor found a tumor the size of a basket ball in her also. She had the surgery which luckily the cancer hadn't spread. She ended up with chemo and radiation. She has been cancer free since then. She also had to pee alot and also had alot of bowel movements and indegestion. I really hope it's not cancerous, I will be keeping you and your family in my thoughts and prayers. Becky",
