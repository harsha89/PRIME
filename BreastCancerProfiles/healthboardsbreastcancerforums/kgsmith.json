    "Content": "Thanks for your insight. I had a mammogram with an ultrasound after Christmas. They said their was an area of concern 1 cm. that was not there 1 year ago. I am scheduled for a biopsy on Wed. two days from now and am scared to death. They said they don't believe it is fluid filled and is a solid mass. I guess we'll see what's going on then. Thank you",
