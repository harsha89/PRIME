    "Content": "Thames: This could be fibrocystic breast disease. Sometimes it's just called lumpy breasts. Does it hurt more right before your period? I found out this was caused by estrogen dominance - too much estrogen. It's worsened by caffeine. Try using some progesterone cream and rubbing it on your breasts. Your doctor should be able to tell if it's it just by an exam. He'll be able to feel the lumps. Don't be overly concerned unless you feel big lumps.",
