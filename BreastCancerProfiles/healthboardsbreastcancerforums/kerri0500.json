    "Content": "I have a question about BC. My stepmother had surgery in Feb, right breast removed. Started Chemo then Radiation. They have since stopped both Chemo and radiation as they said it was not really working. I just talked to her and she has pneumonia and a bloody nose. I understand the pneumonia as she is a smoker and has not really been out of bed for like 2 months (she is in hospice). What causes the bloody nose? Thank you for your help and god bless those of you going through this.",
