    "Content": "New Years Greetings to All. I was diagnosed w/breast cancer on Nov. 5, 2012, had a mastectomy (right breast) on Nov. 28, 2012, and will be seeing my Onologist on Fri. Jan. 4, 2013 re: test results and where we go with Chemo from here. Later they are talking Radiation Therapy, and after all that (+5mths after everything) I can then look into reconstructive surgery. My doctor was great, left a lot for the recon doc to work with when the time comes. To say I am beside myself with all sorts of thoughts would be an understatement! Any tips, useful info, anything,....would be greatly appreciated. Thank you. Sandraleta",
