I am waiting for them to get me in to see a surgeon, I am thinking about having the entire lump removed instead of just a needle biopsy. I just don't think I would trust the needle biopsy. I have had lesions found in my colon, and in my chest, but they don't want to do a biopsy on them yet.",

But go ahead and have the mammogram, if it is anything to be concerned about the earlier you get treatment, the better. I have had mammograms since I was 40, and last week was the first time that they found anything, a small solid lump, which I will be having a biopsy for soon. I just had my GYN exam a week before and the doctor didn't feel anything, so do go ahead and get your mammogram. Best of luck to you I am now 58 years old.",

I am 58 and have had mammograms for the last 18 years faithfully, and just last week they found a lump in my left breast that the exam didn't find. In a weeks time, I had a mammogram, a spot mammogram, ultrasound, doctor visit, surgeon visit, and a needle biopsy. So don't let them put you off.",
