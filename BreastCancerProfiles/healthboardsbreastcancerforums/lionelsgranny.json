      "Content": "HI! I am kind of in a whirlwind right now and just need someone who understands a bit of what I am going through. My hubby and family and friends are wonderful and are trying to help me through this however, unless YOU have gone through it I don't feel you can totally understand. About 9 years ago for my very first mammo they found a \"spot\" and I ended the situation with a needle biopsy (took a section of the lump with a needle not just fluid). It was found to be benign/a lymph node that was swollen. GREAT! Two weeks ago I went in for my regular mammo (exactly 2 weeks today) and got a phone call from my physician first thing Friday (next day) morning saying that I need to go back and have a cone mammo done. Okay, been there before no problem. That was set up for the next Wednesday (last week) and when the mammo was done, tech said, just stay here I need to call your doc back we need to get an order for an ultrasound. Um...okay. So she gets the order and off to ultrasound I go. The tech does the ultrasound, and starts questioning me...how many times have I had cysts removed, do I have a continual problem with them have I had biopies before, and others that I can't remember cuz at that point my mind starts spinning. THEN she says, just a minute I need to grab someone else. She brings in another tech and he goes through the same ultrasound again. They found four places, one of which is like 8 cm (IF I recall exactly). They measured them all, and I was watching the ultrasound on the screen the whole time. So I get dressed and leave. My doc called Monday morning stating I needed to see a surgeon because we needed a biopsy, I go today to see the surgeon. I'm concerned at how fast everything has moved....the first time it was the mammo, a cone mammo and then they decided wait 6 months to see what is going on. THEN another mammo and then the biopsy. I do have a family history in my grandmother, my mother passed away early so we don't know if she would have developed cancer. Anyone had this fast of an experience. I feel that my doctor's office things didn't move as fast as he wanted, as the first phone call he wanted me in first thing Monday morning, but the mammo facility couldn't do it then. I had a feeling when I went in for my initial mammo this time that something was wrong. I hadn't found anything, but once they found it on the mammo I was able to feel \"something\" not really a lump, more like little hard marble-feeling thing. I guess I'm not so worried about me, what ever is, is but I have 5 daughters and I dread passing something like this on to them and putting them and my hubby and brothers through this. I have discussed with hubby that if they find something I want a total mastectomy, everyone feels this is extreme but ...well I watched my grandmother die and I'd rather nip anything possible in the butt first. Thoughts?",
