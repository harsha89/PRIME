    "Content": "I'm starting to get a little concerned. For months now, I have had a quarter-sized rash on my left areola that no matter what, it doesn't completely go away. I've tried Neosporin, hydrocortisone, dermatitis cream, a prescription anti-fungal cream, tea tree oil, etc. It will fade and look like it's going away, then the next day it's scaly, red, and oozing. I thought it was a particular bra at first, but I stopped wearing the bra and it's still there. It's on the areola only, not the nipple and there is no nipple discharge. I'm making an appt. with my gyno, but was wondering if anyone else has had a similar problem and if I should be concerned. thanks.",
