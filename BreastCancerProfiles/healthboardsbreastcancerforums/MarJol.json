    "Content": "I'm 28 and a healthy weight. My mother's mom had breast cancer 2 separate times during her life (the first being at age 34). In July '10 I found identical lumps on both breasts. I went to my doctor within 24 hours and she said they seemed normal to her and were probably glands but sent me for a bilateral ultrasound and mammogram. The mam and ultrasound showed nothing abnormal. In fact, they couldn't really see much of anything because my breasts are so dense. Then in Aug. '11 I went back to my gyno for my yearly and of course she did a breast exam. She never mentioned anything abnormal at that time and the lumps were still there. Now it is Feb. '12 and it seems like one lump has gotten just ever so slightly bigger on one breast. Please note that I have lumps throughout both breast that match up on the other breast as far as location goes. I'm wondering now if I should be worried about these lumps. If they are glands then is it normal to be able to feel them like that? The fact that they are in the same locations on both sides makes me feel somewhat better but I'm still worried that I'm able to feel them at all. By the way, the lumps don't change in size due to my period. They stay the same size always. Could this be cancer? Should I go back the doctor again for the same thing? Could this be fibrocystic changes because of my age? I'm worrying myself sick.",
