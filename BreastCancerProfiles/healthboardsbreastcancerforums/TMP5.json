I have thick green veins going through my areola as well. I'm currently only period right now and I'm terrified. Please help. None of those symptoms are suggestive of breast cancer in any way. Breast cancer virtually never occurs in women in their teens. See your doctor if it would make you feel better to be checked, but I think it's likely you are perfectly fine.",
