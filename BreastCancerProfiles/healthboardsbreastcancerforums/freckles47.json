      "Content": "Seajay, I, too, have had fluid filled cysts in the past. Two mammograms last spring, and nothing was found. In August a small lump in right breast began to be sore and I went to primary care doc who sent me to specialist. A couple of weeks later had a biopsy and it was positive. If you are concerned at all, be your own advocate and demand to see a breast specialist. Hopefully it will be nothing, and you will be relieved. Good luck!",

      "Content": "Hi Valleygirl, Bless your heart, breast surgery, followed by hysterectomy--you have a lot on your plate. I'm three weeks post lumpectomy, and have started chemo. Feeling good, so far. I had a hysterectomy 14 years ago, and it was the best gift I've ever given myself. Went on Premarin for most of that time, so didn't have any side effects to speak of. Although breast cancer wasn't estrogen positive, I'm now off hormones--so my hot flashes are really a bummer now. Be thinking of and saying a prayer for you these next few days. Best wishes.
