      "Content": "I had microcalcifications that were diagnosed in 2008. I didn't go back for 5 years. When I finally went back in 2013, they were now diagnosed as \"clustered microcalcifications\" and I was sent for a core needle biopsy. My results came out benign. I am now being monitored every 6 months religiously. I would inquire about a biopsy, as that is really the only way they can know for sure and help alleviate your much understood worries. Good Luck",

      "Content": "I was seen yesterday for an ultrasound/mammogram following a recommendation by my GYN for palpable masses felt in my left breast. My main concern was my left breast has been feeling \"heavy\" and painful to touch. I feel like I'm lactating (haven't nursed in 18 years) and I have the sensation of \"let down\" and engorged at times. The ultrasound revealed no indication of cancer but the technician commented I have \"dilated milk ducts\" and offered no further explanation. I am now panicking of course and wondering what this means?? I had clustered microcalcifications detected last summer, biopsied and cleared in the same breast. Can this be the same type diagnosis. Some changes are definitely happening in my ducts of my breast. Is this a precursor to cancer??? Please Please, anyone, can you please give me some input and put my mind at ease. I am patiently waiting to hear from my GYN for the next step but meanwhile, I'd love some insight on questions I can ask. THANK YOU AND HUGS TO ALL!!",

      "Content": "I was diagnosed with a 2mm-7mm hypoechoic nodule that is 25mm long x 12mm x 10mm multiple simple cyst that was found in my right breast at the 6 o'clock area during my last mammo. I had my first mammo 5 years ago and at that time it was noted as \"fibrous tissues\". Also I have recently had a cluster of microcalcifications that I had to have a stereotactic core needle biopsy (almost 2 weeks ago). These micros were also noted 5 years ago at my last mammo but because they were now clustered, the doc thought I should have a biopsy. The biopsy came back noting \"withing terminal duct lobular unit there are coarse stromal dystrophic breast calcifications and mild chronic inflammation\"",

      "Content": "I just had a stereotactic core needle biopsy on a cluster of microcalcifications noted from my mammo this past December. These had been there about 5 years but because they were now clustered, they recommended biopsy. I was very scared and nervous and had a horrible experience with the procedure itself. If you can, ask for a sedative. I too questioned whether I should have done now or wait 6 months, since they had been there for 5 years. My results came back B9.",

      "Content": "I am hoping to reach out to others that may be going through the same thing, so please, any input is appreciated or opinions. Just don't want to feel like I'm the only one out here. I have been experiencing painful, lumpy breasts for the past 5 years. I have been told I have dense breast tissue, fibrous tissue, fibrodanomas (spelling??), CLUSTERED microcalcifications (stereotactic core needle biopsy revealed benign results thank God), hypoechio (spelling nodules), etc, etc. For the last couple months, my breasts feel very heavy and full (I am a \"B\" cup at best and not very large at all), tender to touch and are unbearable when removing my bra. My breasts feel almost \"engorged\" like they did when I use to nurse my kids (haven't nursed in over 18 years!!). Minimal stabbing pains and these pains do not come and go with my monthly cycle. In addition, I have had an 9x15mm endometrial polyp removed discovered when I was sent for a transvaginal ultrasound for irregular periods. I had a cyst removed from my cervix and d & c. Biopsy revealed borderline \"low grade LSIL\". I'm sure it must be hormones but feel something is still not quite right. I'm not do for my annual mammogram until January 2015 and I'm scheduled to see my GYN July 18th. I'm not sure if I should push for another breast ultrasound before then? Any suggestions/recommendations?? Thank you in advance!",
