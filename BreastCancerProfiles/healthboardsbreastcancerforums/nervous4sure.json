    "Content": "This is where I was last week: Hi everyone. Super stressed... i felt a bee sting type feeling in my left breast several months ago, i pressed into it and felt a lump. I kept checking it over the last several months. The pain would come and go and i couldnt figure a rhyme or reason. I went to see my gyno last week, and brought it to her attention. She is sending me for a mammo and ultrasound, on monday to be exact. Her order state that there is a 1.5 movable lump in the left breast 10 oclock. It feels oval like, and i can move it smoothly over my fingers and it feels wedged between breast tissue. I have had under arm pain on the left side for quite sometime, and i had brought that up to my gyno the visit before this one but she said it was probably from picking up the kids... makes sense. Anyways... i have been reading... i thought maybe it was cyst, but it has not changed in size, ever. I thought it could be that fibro something or other, but again, it doesnt change in size.... i dont know, can someone help me? Is breast cancer always rock hard? If cysts moves, just what does that mean? How much would it move? Just looking for some advice from real people. Thanks in advance! And here is where i am today: Hi everyone. I went in today. They did the first set of mammo pics, then had me come back for several more. I glanced several times at her screen and had seen a brighter, whiter area where my lump is. After being back in the waiting room they then had me come in for ultrasound. While she could most certainly feel it, she said she could not detect anything via ultrasound. Over and over the lump she went, but alas nothing. She said if it was a cyst it most certainly would have picked it up (????) That left me kinda confused. She said she would send the reports to my gyn and she may order a mri. Could my age (30) make detecting these things more difficult? She said maybe its just breast tissue that has always been there... but i know it hasnt, no other part of either of my breast feel like this. And do they not only send you for ultrasound if infact the mammo detects something? That then the ultrasound is to tell if that something is fluid filled, or hard? Uhg, i am confused to say the least. I see my gyn next week, hopefully she can help me better understand. I guess my next question would be about an mri. Can mammo and ultrasound not pick up anything but mri can and does? Is this uncommon? Thanks so much",
