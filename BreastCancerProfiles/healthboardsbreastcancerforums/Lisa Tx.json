      "Content": "If you have cystic breasts it is best to schedule your mammograms for after your period. Any cysts are going to be largest right before and during your period. The 6 month wait is pretty standard. Just be sure that next time you aim for the right time in your cycle to decrease the chances of false readings.",

      "Content": "A second opinion is never a bad idea. However, I also have had problems with fibrocycstic breasts and even ended up with a breast biopsy last year. I decided not to do THAT again, so after lots of research am now taking a magnesium/calcium supplement daily, along with a B vitamin and Vitamin E. They have made a major difference. My breasts are softer, and while I still get cysts before my period, they are smaller and much less painful (now \"annoying\" instead of \"painful\"). And this year, for the first time ever, I didn't have to go back for followup tests after my mammogram. I just got a \"come back next year\" letter. It was wonderful. Lisa",
