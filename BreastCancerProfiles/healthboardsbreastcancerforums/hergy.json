      "Content": "Seeing a doctor will rest your mind. Pain means something's going on - whether it's harmless hormonal changes or something else, you should consult your doctor. Youth doesn't grant you immunity from breast health issues. I get a similar pain in my breast that comes and goes. It's sharp, like a short lightning bolt. I asked my doctor about it, and an exam was performed. It turned out to be harmless - a sort of unexplained quirk. Checking for lumps can be scary because you don't want to find anything. Some women are naturally a bit 'lumpy' so identifying the normal from the abnormal is difficult. Get regular office exams and become familiar with the make-up of your own breasts. You'll be able to tell if something's not normal. Don't be afraid of your body. The unknown is a lot more frightening.",

      "Content": "If your doctor is attentive to your problem, there should be no reason to worry about cancer is the doctor isn't worried. If other doctors agree with the diagnosis, feel free to ask your doctor why the problem refuses to go away. If the condition persists and your doctor doesn't provide satisfactory answers, don't be afraid to check with another doctor. Your comfort and peace of mind are important. Best wishes, Nikki",

      "Content": "I had a lumpectomy to remove a cancerous tumor and 7 weeks of radiation. Pain from recovery from my surgery was more of an issue for me than the radiation. The actual procedure is short. Tattoos applied during a simulation procedure well before your treatments help technicians line up the machine and radiation hits the same target every time. Burns sometimes begin to appear after a couple of weeks, but the severity varies with different patients. You will be given a cream to use to protect your skin. Use it, even when you don't think it's necessary. After about 2-1/2 weeks, I developed first degree burns in some areas, but the discomfort only amounted to some unpleasant itching. After about 4 weeks, my burns had become second degree. That caused discomfort and increased itching and sensitivity, but I was glad to see that the invisible radiation was affecting the area. It gave me visual proof that possibly dangerous cells were dying. My burns never passed second degree. You will be closely monitored by your radiation oncologist. Treatments can be stopped if side effects become severe. My cancer team and the radiation technicians were so kind and encouraging that the experience was not a bad one. Cancer was my enemy, not the treatment or the medical professionals who helped.",
