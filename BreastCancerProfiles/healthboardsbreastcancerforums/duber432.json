    "Content": "My best wishes to you all; I just found this site and am so grateful. Back in November microcalcifications were found on my mammo and after a stereotactic core biopsy, I was diagnosed with LCIS, and was advised to have an open biopsy. I just got the results of my open biopsy today and it was confirmed I have LCIS in the surrounding tissue. The doctor confirmed it is not cancer, rather a \"marker\", and advised me of the 3 treatment options. 1) See him every 6 months for examinations, ultrasounds, mammos, etc.; 2) same thing together with taking tamoxifen; and 3) bilateral mastectomy. He explained the serious side effects of the drug and explained that the bilateral is something that is not decided right now. I opted for seeing him in 6 months. Can anyone who has gone down this path with this diagnosis tell me what they did or what they didn't do and should have. I'd appreciate any help, suggestions, or advise. I live in New York and my doctor is a specialist at Columbia Presbyterian, so I'm confident in that respect. I wish everyone well. Thanks",
