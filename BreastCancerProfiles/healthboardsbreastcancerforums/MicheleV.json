      "Content": "I had a mammogram and ultrasound this week. They found a small mass, so they did a fine needle biopsy and although it came back as non cancerous, I need an MRI on Tuesday to confirm that this is all that there is. The radiologist seemed to think they wouldnt find any cancer, but she said in a small % of cases, it can be found. Assuming this is all I have, I have to have this lesion removed with wire guided biopsy. Has anyone here had a similar situation, and was everything okay?? I keep thinking, the odds are good that this is all I have...the radiologist said they remove these things as a precautionary measure as they can turn into cancer after long periods of time...but Im of course scared. I already go for annual colonoscopies due to colon cancer in my family and a history of colitis. Thanks for ANY posts...Im 33 and trying not to sleep over this just yet. Michele",

      "Content": "Robin, thanks for the post. I am not looking forward to the wire biopsy, but hearing about others has helped . If you dont mind me asking, what were they looking for when you had your biopsy done? Did they already suspect cancer? Or was it unknown. They have not seen cancer yet in my case, and say the odds are good this is just a radial scar/lesion, but they cant totally rule it out yet either. They used the term excisional biopsy...but seems to be similar to a lumpectomy from what I gather. I am trying to hold it together until I have actual news, but yes...the waiting is not fun.
