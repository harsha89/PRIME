    "Content": "Hi, I'm just wondering what your outcome was since yours is the most recent post that I have been able to find! I had a mammogram yesterday (June 7th) and my doctor called this morning to tell me I needed another mammogram and ultrasound due to retroareolar asymmetry in the right breast and central asymmetry in the left breast. I am freaking out because everything I've researched today says that this can be an early sign of cancer. I also had no masses or calcifications. How did your next testing go? I think knowing someone else going through might help my anxiety. I can't get in for the 2nd mammogram until Saturday, the 15th, so I am not sure how I'm going to make it through the week! Thanks for any updates!",
