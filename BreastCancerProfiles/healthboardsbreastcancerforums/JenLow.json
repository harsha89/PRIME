      "Content": "Hi to all. This is my very first post here and I need to hear out any advice or experiences from members. Here goes.... Four days ago, I discovered a small nodule in the top inner quadrant of my left breast. I went to see a doctor today and she felt that area and commented the nodule is tiny, possibly 5mm or less. She also said that it seemed to be in and around the skin layers and not embedded deep inside the breast tissue. She termed it as 'superficial' though it is not visible on the surface. Anyway she ordered an ultrasound scan of my left breast on 29 Oct to get a clearer picture of what's going on. I must add that I had a mammogram done on 21 March this year and no abnormalties found. My questions are :- 1. Should I be overly concerned? I'm actually freaking out now. 2. Has anyone here has had the same experience as me? 3. What are the chances that this nodule may turn out to be cancerous? I'm a bunch of nerves right now thinking how the ultrasound report will turn out. Thank you for reading my post.",

The only difference with this mammogram was that they didn't tell me know changes like they did last time. I have a couple of autoimmune disorders that I get regular treatment. One of the side effects is that it does slightly increase the chance of getting cancer. I can wait for the results. My husband and I have talked about it a couple of years ago after two friends died from BC and a third was diagnosed. I told him hands down a mastectomy for sure. No I'm not jumping the gun here. But over the last few years I've been faced with some scary medical decisions. Thanks for letting me get this off my mind. Hi lild4. I'm going for an ultrasound next week and know how anxious we can get. I too have an autoimmune disorder. Just want to let you know you are not alone in this. Big hugs to you! ðŸ˜ƒ",
