    "Content": "Hello, A week ago I knocked myself on my left nipple and realised it was quite sore. Having a quick feel I discovered a small lump just behind my nipple on the left hand side. Obviously the first thing I did was look online, and seeing that lumps in mens breasts isn't very common, I automatically assumed the worst. I made an appointment at the doctor who felt around my breast (also checking my arm pits and neck) and said the area feels more 'full' but nothing they seem to think is cause for concern, and that if it does stay or gets bigger then come back. However since then I'm positive the lump has got bigger. It feels like it's gone from a pea to the size of a marble in just under a week. It's still a little tender (although not sure if this is me just poking it) and I think it moves when I or my gf touch it. I'm 30 years old, not overweight, and as far as I'm aware have no history of cancer in the family. Obviously you can't diagnose over the internet but any help or advice would be greatly appreciated, I'm extremely worried.",
