    "Content": "Hi all I posted this yesterday in the women's health thread but looking around the forums a bit more I thought I might get more of a response here, so here goes: Does anybody know if it's possible to have a breast infection but without the painful area being red? The reason I ask is because earlier this year I did have a breast infection - it started off as a hard patch on my breast that soon turned red. It was very painful and I had a temperature. That was resolved with nearly 2 weeks of medicine. After that I had scans and check-ups at the hospital and was found to have a few small cysts in my breast and a 7mm lump that i've never had any pain from. The lump was biopsied and is benign. Now though, I have another painful area in my breast,a different area from the previous time. It is sometimes harder than at other times, but there is no redness, i'm sometimes hot/cold and it's painful. There is no redness though. That seems to be the only difference from last time. I've been to the doctor though and didn't get any medecine this time, just a referral to the hospital next week. Any thoughts greatly appreciated. Thanks",
