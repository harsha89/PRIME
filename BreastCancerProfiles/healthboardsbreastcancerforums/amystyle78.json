    "Content": "Hi everyone, my name is Amy. I am a 35 year old mom of two teenagers. I have had a very itchy rash on my areola and nipple now for about 8 months. I have tried every cream/lotion known to man and it gets better but always comes right back. Right now it is just starting to return after using a hydrocortisone cream. I have also had a yellow/green discharge from the nipple about the same length of time. My left breast is normal. My maternal grandmother had breast cancer 10 years ago. She had a mastectomy and is still doing great. So I finally broke down and went to my GP yesterday afternoon. He mentioned that it was a small possibility of this being Paget\u0092s disease. He did a breast exam and discovered a small knot just under the nipple. He scheduled a bilateral diagnostic mammogram (never had one before) and put me on a course of antibiotics just in case this is some sort of infection. I am pretty calm about the whole thing despite reading tons of scary information online. I do think that the waiting is terrible. I have not told any other family members yet because I just don\u0092t want them to worry unnecessarily. Does anyone have any advice or experience to share with me?",
