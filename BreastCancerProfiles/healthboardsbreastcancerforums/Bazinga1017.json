    "Content": "Lozzie1, I'm so sorry you are going to be going through this. I had bilateral mastectomies with immediate reconstruction in 2012. The time spent waiting before the surgery is so very hard. Please keep us updated. I will pray for you on the 3rd. And maybe you and your new husband can plan a delayed honeymoon after your chemo. Then you will have lots of things to celebrate!",
