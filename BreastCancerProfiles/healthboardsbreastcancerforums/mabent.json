      "Content": "Hi Minnie - I agree that your age makes it improbable that you would have breast cancer. However, you are understandably concerned about the lump and underarm soreness. Stress can cause illness all by itself, so my advice would be to go to a oncologist-gyn to check this. He has experience in this area and can either reassure you or suggest that you have an ultrasound or MRI, if he feels it is necessary. As they say, 'it's your body'. No doctor would blame you for being cautious. Good luck! Mabent",

      "Content": "Hi again - My feeling about this new doctor is that he may want to take some more tests, and that that's why nothing about your condition was mentioned. I really think you will feel much better after you have seen him because you have been kept in the dark so long. I had a cancerous lesion years ago and worried and worried from doctor to doctor; but finally I found a wonderful oncologist who explained everything to me, including the fact that the cancer could recur at some time in the future. Honestly, just finally hearing what my true diagnosis was made me feel calmer. I agree that you should take a recorder or a notebook with you to your appointment. Doctors can do amazing things these days, so please try not to worry too much and just let this new doctor take over. I wish you the very best of luck!!! Mabent",

      "Content": "Hi Babysister - I just saw your posts and want to give you some encouraging thoughts. Three years ago my best friend was diagnosed with non-Hodgkins Lymphoma. She, like you, had lost weight. She had been in a bad automobile accident, and while at the hospital they told her that there was something they found in her kidney which should be checked. No one did anything further for a year, and she, like you, lost weight and had various other complaints. Finally, she had an ultrasound which showed a mass on her kidney. They took a biopsy and found that it was Lymphoma. She had the tumor removed. As of now, she is feeling well and continues to be followed up by her oncologist with Pet scans, etc. But, so far she is cancer- free;l think that means that she is in remission. So, please don't be discouraged because these days there are many ways to stop the progression of this disease. Hope this helps. Best wishes, Mabent",

      "Content": "Hi - Sorry you are having such trouble getting a diagnosis! What is the reason for this, do you suppose?? Is your doctor too busy? Doesn't he realize how anxious you must be now since you keep losing weight, having night sweats, have been told that you might lose your job if something isn't done? Do you think he is the right doctor for you? Can you get your records of all the tests and take them to another doctor to get a second opinion? I hope you get an answer soon!!! Perhaps if you write your doctor a personal letter..... Good luck!!!! Mabent",

      "Content": "I am so sorry for all the frustrating things that have happened to you! I'm so glad that you will be seeing the doctor today. Please do not be afraid to ask for more, or even stronger medication to help you through this. The doctor should know by now that you aren't a drug addict! If you become dependent on the pain killers, you will be able to get off of them gradually with help from your doctor. Becoming dependent on a drug is not the same as being 'addicted' to it. You are taking the Percocet because you need it for pain! If it has stopped helping you, then naturally you must change dosages or be prescribed another medication for your pain. The doctor will understand that. Being in constant pain will just make you all tense, etc., which will not help your health at all. Good luck!!!! Mabent",

      "Content": "Chances are that everything is normal in your mammogram. They state that they inform you because of a recent law - probably so that you can't sue them if something turns up later. However, just to be sure, you should ask your gynecologist to explain the significance of the report. I do not have dense breasts, but each time I have had a mammogram, the report comes back that they can't be sure because I have dense breasts but that otherwise everything looks normal. this also happens when my daughter has a mammogram.
