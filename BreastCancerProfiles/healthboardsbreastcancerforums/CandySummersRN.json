It's not painful, it's kind of moveable and it's pretty hard. I scheduled an appointment with the breast center and I'll be going in on Tuesday afternoon. A part of me is worried and a larger part of me is not. There hasn't been any woman in my family that has died of cancer, yet alone breast cancer. Am I in denial or something? Has anyone gone through this? Cancer is nothing to play games with....... A history of cancer in familys is just a rule...... \"Rules Can Be Broken\".........and know this from personal experence as a nurse! Sincerely Candy Summers, RN",
