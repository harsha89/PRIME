    "Content": "Ive had this lump in my breast for a year now. It recently became bigger so I had an ultrasound done. They came back and said that the lump was there...they could feel it, but it wasnt showing up on the ultrasound. SO MY QUESTION IS, WHAT DOES THIS MEAN AND IS THIS A GOOD THING? My mom has had breast cancer...she was diagnosed at 39. Im 27 now so I am really concerened. I was told that it would be a week before my doctor got back to me on what this ultrasound meant. I dont think Im going to stay sane that long. If anyone has experienced this or has any knowledge of what this could mean for me I would welcome the info. Thanks!",
