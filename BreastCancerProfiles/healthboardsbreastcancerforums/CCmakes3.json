      "Content": "Thanks for your replies, ladies! I am certainly not an ultrasound expert, but I have had about 7 or 8 of them in my life due to recurrent cysts, pregnancies, etc. I pretty much knew what she was looking at because of the things she would type in onto the screen (for example, \"Left ovary, trans view,\" \"Left ovary, long view,\" etc.) Every image of the left ovary looked very different from the corresponding \"view\" of the right. But maybe I should just be glad that the right one appears to be OK! I have so many things racing through my mind right now, including the recent findings that hormone replacement therapy causes cancer, alzheimer's, etc. and are no longer recommending it at all, for anyone. So what will happen to me if I have to have a hysterectomy at 34? I guess at least I have finished having children. Anyway, you two are so kind to have responded. Robin, the pictures were fascinating and wr, I am taking your advice and trying to breathe easy for the time being. I have a lot of work to keep my busy on Monday, so that is a blessing! Take care, CC",

      "Content": "Hi, I had a pelvic and transvaginal ultrasound yesterday and one ovary looked very different from the other. The right ovary looked small, dark and oval shaped, but the left was at least twice as big and very irregular shaped, with a lot of white streaks inside of it. Does anyone know what this would indicate? I am kind of worried because my doctor only ordered a pelvic ultrasound, but after looking at my left ovary for about 10 minutes, the tech announced that she would have to perform a transvaginal ultrasound. I don't see the doctor again until Tuesday, so I guess I won't know anything until then, but I just wanted to know if anyone else has any experience with this. I've tried to find ultrasound pics of ovarian cancer (or even normal ovaries) on the internet but couldn't find a thing.",
