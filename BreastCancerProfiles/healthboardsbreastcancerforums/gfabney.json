    "Content": "I had found a lump in my breast also. It really scared me since my grandmother died with breast cancer. I had an ultrasound instead of a mamogram. They said because i was only 32 my breast wouldnt give a good mamogram. Anyway, it turned out that i had fiber cystic in my breast. This was the cause of the lump i had and it always gets worse right before my period. I dont know if your lump is tender, but mine is, again, especially before my period. Don't know how true it is but i've always heard that breast lumps that hurt are not cancerous. I'm sure there are some exceptions to that. and of course its always best to get this checked out w/ your Dr.",
