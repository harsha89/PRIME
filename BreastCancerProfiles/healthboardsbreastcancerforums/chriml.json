      "Content": "I also had to go back for repeat mamo & ultrasound. We make ourselves sick over getting the results with good cause. I received a new letter and they said to come back in 6 months to make sure there are no changes. my letter said probably benigh. I have to say that worried me so I called the office. Thet said I have dence breast tissue and doing the compression of the left breast the tissue did bounce back so thats how they know it is dense tissue. I have to say the letter still does bother me. Anyone also have this experience?",

      "Content": "I am a little concerned about a letter I received today. I went for my regular mamo 3 weeks ago and They sent a letter saying I needed a repeat mamo & a ultrasound. I received the results today and when I was reading it sounded like they want to wait & see. Now Im in a panic.It said \" YOUR RECENT MAMMOGRAM AND BREAST ULTRASOUND EXAMINATION SHOWED AN AREA THAT WE BELIEVE IS BENIGN ( NOT CANCER). hOWEVER IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE A FOLLOW UP MAMMOGRAM IN 6 MONTHS TO CONFIRM THAT THIS AREA HAS NOT CHANGED. A BREAT FINDING SHOULD NEVER BE IGNORED DESPITE A NORMAL MAMMOGRAM.\" I FEEL LIKE IF THEY ARE NOT 100% SURE IT IS OK WHY WAIT. aNY FEEDBACK WOULD BE APPRECIATED.THANK YOU.",

      "Content": "Thank you for replying. I just felt like if it is something why wait 6 months. A doctor told me that they cant say 100% not cancer even though it probably is because they have to cover themselves. Good luck! I hope all is well with you also!",
