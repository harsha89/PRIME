    "Content": "I am a 4 year breast cancer survivor. I am wondering is there anyone out there who has had a problem with fluid around the heart since radiation? Whenever I do any physical exertions, I experience shortness of breath, and in some cases severe fluid build up in my chest area, coughing/wheezing, and I can not lay down for almost an hour. Please help, this is getting old and my love life(I'M married) is suffering! rhona",
