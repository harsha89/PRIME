    "Content": "[Very familiar story. I had a Fibroadenoma *removed* through stereostatic biopsy. I swore I saw it disappera on the ultrasound. Within 2 weeks I felt it was still there. They wouldn't do another ultrasound that soon and said it was a hematoma. + year later ultrasound showed it was still there, as well as about 6 cysts, all in the sdame breasts. They also siad it was not needed to be biopsied again but I have to go every 6 months for 2 years for mammo/US, my next being Oct 24th. I hate the worry but have to say that I figured if it was anything, I wouls surely know by now. The living and waiting/wondering is horrible. I have very dense breasts at 45 years of age which makes Mammo diagnostic very unclear, hence the Ultrasound. I hope your Dr.'s just keep you on a close watch as well.",
