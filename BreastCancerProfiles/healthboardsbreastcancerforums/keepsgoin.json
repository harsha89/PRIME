    "Content": "I will mention cancer too...I've recently heard of a fairly rare breast cancer called Inflammatory Breast Cancer or IBC which causes the itching you are talking about and inverted nipples. It's not going to show up on a Mammogram though...it will need to be biopsied. The fact that it's very uncommon means that a lot of doctors aren't familiar with it. It's very invasive but can be removed/treated if caught soon enough. On the report I watched on the news, the doctors talking about it investigated by calling breast cancer hot lines and out of the something like 8 that she called, only 1 knew what it was!!!!!!!!! NOT GOOD! So they made sure that they got \"informed\" asap! Oh and another thing...this cancer doesn't cause any lumps so a doctor would not feel a lump!",
