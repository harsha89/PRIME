    "Content": "I was a member of this forum last fall when I first discovered a breast lump, but can't find my logins so I re-registered. There are so many knowledgable people on this forum, I was hoping someone can help me understand my report. I suffer from high anxiety I can barely sleep from worry. Last fall I found a pea size lump which the doctor ordered sonogramed. I'm schedule for a repeat in a couple of week, but today at my Gyn, is the first time I saw last fall's report - (they talked to me at the time, but I never received the report). It reads: well circumscribed, hypoechoic to isoechoic mass, suggesting a small cluster of cysts. No solid masses are demonstrated, nor suspicious shadowing. There is questionable nodular density on the right CC view that may correspond to this lesion. The breast tissue is very dense mammographically. ACR Category 3 I was told at the time, it was likely a (single) cyst, but I thought cycsts were not hypoechoic. It seems to be the same size, but some of the verbiage in the report worries me - the \"questionable nodular density\" - as well as the fact that if my tissue is very dense mammographically, then what good it is to do mammograms? Can someone please help ease my mind - is this a benign mass, or does it indicate possible cancer? It seems to be the same size as last year (I check it all the time) - but it doesn't hurt. I'm rather confused and very worried. Thank you for any insight you can provide!",
