Can you call them back and ask exactly what the ultrasound showed? If they say a cyst, that's great! If they say a solid lesion, you need more follow-up. Oh, alright. The first ultrasound showed nothing. The second, in the breast surgeon's office, showed this little round thing and she said \"That's probably what you felt.\" and wasn't concerned so now it makes sense, it was obviously a hollow lump. Thanks.",

      "Content": "I recently saw my gyno for a breast lump (pea-sized, moves when pressed down). She felt it and sent me for an ultrasound. It came back negative, with nothing showing up on there (which confused me, because I felt something, as did she). She said that since I still felt it, I should see a breast specialist. Before my appt, I found another lump right next to it (I don't know if it was there beforehand or not. It was similar to the first, maybe a little bigger and moves around less easily but still moves). So I went to one the other day and just by feeling the breast, she said it was benign, and not to worry. She did another ultrasound in the office and not much came up (at one point there was an oval on screen and she said that's probably what I felt, either a cyst or fibroadenoma). I was just wondering if it's normal for a doctor to diagnose a lump (or lumps) as benign without doing a biopsy. I'm 23 years old, no history of bc in my family, but still nervous (and checking myself like crazy everyday). I'm trying to tell myself that if two doctors said not to worry, then I shouldn't, but I sometimes have a hard time trusting doctors.",

My breast clinic was very aggressive - I had a large mass that didn't go away with my periods, the ultrasound showed nothing, needle biopsy produced nothing so he went ahead and did a biopsy. It was just a cyst. From what you describe it sounds like cysts. They generally occur in multiples, I know my do, can easily be moved and sometimes cause pain. My sometimes do, sometimes don't. Thanks. Yeah, the breast surgeon said I had fibrocystic breast disease as well.",
