    "Content": "Hello Annie: I see your post is 2 years old, hope this gets to you. I have been on Arimidex for 1.5 years now and showing bone loss. Diagnosed with Osteoporosis at L1&2 and hips are in the osteopenia level. My Onc wants me to go on Fosamax but I don't want to take it due to the side effects. I found Ezorb and have started to take it. I hope it works for me, only time will tell. If you are still on it, has it worked for you? Hope all is well with you. I'm a year post chemo and trying to get my life back. Look forward to your reply.",
