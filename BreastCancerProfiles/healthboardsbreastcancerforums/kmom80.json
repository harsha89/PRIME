    "Content": "I just had a sonomammogram for breast pain and other things and they found calcifications on the side that didn't hurt! Certain medications can cause breast pain and hormonal issues have you used a new birth control, changed your diet, exercising more, really stressed out? I'm 35 and my doctor said I'm way too young that I have a better chance of getting struck by a meteor than having bc. I think your issue is probably from your cycle or hormonal issues or side effects to meds. If it really is that tender you can have mastitis and they just give you antibiotics. If you were a lot older and had breast changes I would say screen for other things but take a deep breath. I wish I was 22 again!",
