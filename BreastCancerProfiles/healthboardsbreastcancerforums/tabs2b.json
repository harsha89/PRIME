    "Content": "Hi Nancy-- My mother recently went through a mammogram scare too. She's 49 and had just had her yearly mammogram and she got a letter stating an area appeared suspicious. She had a follow-up mammogram and it turned out to be just dense breast tissue. The letter she received was not very specific, so she requested a copy of her mammogram report which outlined in greater detail what the radiologist thought was suspicious--you might consider doing that if you have not yet. One statistic I read was that 80% of breast lumps are benign. Hope this makes you feel a bit better! Tina",
