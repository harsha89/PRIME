      "Content": "Well I am a 32 and I quit nursing my daughter in September...About Late December I noticed my left breast would sink in if I lifted my arm....I contacted my doctor and she did an exam and told me to return in 1 month....Went back for my check up, she felt no obvious lumps but sent me for a diagnostic bilat anyways, I had that done on 2/6...Than I had to have an ultrasound..The results are as follows: The tissue of both breasts is heterogeneously dense. This may lower the sensitivity of mammography. There are multiple benign appearing scattered densities in both breasts. No other significant masses, calcifications, ot other findings are seen in either breast...That is the mammo report...This is the ultrasound report: There is a 7mm oval mass with a circumscribed margin in the right breast at 8 o'clock in the middle depth. This oval mass is hypoechoic with posterior acoustic enhancement. Ultrasound impression: BENIGN The 7mm oval mass in the right breast at 8 o'clock in the middle depth is consistent with a complicated cyst and appears benign. They told me I would not have to return until 40 years of age when I left the ultrasound, than they send me a letter telling me to have a follow up in 6months.....I am confused at what to think.....No family DX of breast cancer....I just wanted to see if anyone else has had this kind of thing? Thanks, Ralinda",

      "Content": "Let me start off by saying I have 4 kids and the last 2 I breastfeed until 22 months....Well, last week I was taking the towel off my head and my arms were above my head and I noticed that my breast caves in and the nipple sinks in as well....The right breast does the same but not as noticable....I called my sister and mentioned it to her and said I should make a appointment....I do go to see my family doctor on the 5th...Now she has got me worried!!!! Is this something to worry about, since both my breast sink in? I am 32 btw...Thanks, Ralinda",

      "Content": "WellI went tothe doctor today and she told me not to worry it was nothing serious....She did all kind of mashing, pinching,kneeding, arms up arms down, you get it.......She is going to check me again in a month..She said all she felt was my normal glands, but if I feel anything or if anything changes come right away...In a month she will schedule me for a mammagram, if tricare will cover it..She said since I am under 40 and she didn't notice anything they probably wont cover it...anyways thanks, rAlinds",
