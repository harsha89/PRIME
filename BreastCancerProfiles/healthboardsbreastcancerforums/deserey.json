    "Content": "Hi everyone ! I'm brand new here & scared ! My first mammo post breast reduction (1 yr ago), shows \"cluster of microcalcifications, associated with a slight density.\" brad4. Biopsy suggested. I'm hoping this is related to the surgery, as the clusters are \"retroaerolar\" & this is close to where my breast was cut during surgery. Can anyone help me with info about this ? My biopsy is scheduled for next friday. Thanks !",
