    "Content": "-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I am a 53 year old woman who is fighting metastatic breast cancer. It came back last year after almost 8 years. I was treated with Avastin and Paxitaxal as part of a trial study. I was on this treatment for almost a year. It did work well taking away a lot of the tumors but has left me with severe muscle damage and edema in my left buttocks, hip & leg, severe neuropathy in my left foot and ankle, mild neuropathy in my right bottom foot and hands & fingers. The Dr. is mystified as to what has caused the muscle damage and edema in my buttocks & thigh. He says he can only attribute it to the Avastin. I am trying to find out if anyone else has had issues like this. I have also been to an orthopedic oncologist at the U/M and she could give me no answers or help for it either. I would appreciate any suggestions that I could take to my Dr.",
