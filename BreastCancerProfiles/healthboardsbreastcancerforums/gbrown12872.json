    "Content": "Just turned 40 and had my first mammo a month ago. 2 suspicious spots noted on mammo, u/s & biopsy were performed. One spot was fibrocystic in nature, so no further action taken. The other spot was determined to be a sclerosing papilloma, which I just had removed last week. Just received the pathology report from the nurse, who seemed confused & said something to the effect of \"it doesn't say malignant anywhere, but I'm not sure this is good news\" (helpful, right? ) Anyway, the surgery pathology still said sclerosing papilloma, but also also mentioned lumenal (sp?) microcalcifications, which were not noted on the mammo, u/s or biopsy. Due to the holiday, there's not a dr who can talk to me until tomorrow, which is frustrating to say the least ... I cannot find anything about microcalcifications found after excision but not on a mammo -- everything I've found mentions the microcalcs as being the reason for excision ... So, should I be worried about the new development? What I've found about microcalcs suggests they are typically benign, as are papillomas, so I want to be positive, but would love to know if anyone has any first hand experience in this area ... Thanks in advance!!!",
