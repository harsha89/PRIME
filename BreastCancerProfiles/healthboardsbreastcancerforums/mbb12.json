    "Content": "Hi, I hope that you are still on this site. I am new on this site too, and just received news of a focal asymmetry in my left breast, but no masses or calcifications were noted. I am having more testing in 2 days. It's been hard like you said in 2011. I hope all was fine for you. Could you please tell me, if you don't mind, how things worked out for you? Thank you soo much!",
