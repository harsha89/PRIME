I've had clear discharge for many years (15+)and have just started having black (which is old blood).......it's not fun but they said that I don't have cancer ..so I'm happy..good luck.",

She's sending me for a ultra sound and mamagram this week ..... THAt worries me ..this is Onatrio I live in it usually takes months to get a test done. Everything I read about black discharge lead me to belive that it was probably just a benige fibroid cyst ....excuse my spelling it sucks when I'm upset...Sshould I be worried ????",

But happily they were both negative and my surgen belives it's probaly not cancer. Get to your doctor ASAP...this isn't a noram breast thing and you really have to get it checked out ...good luck!!",
