    "Content": "Hey there, I have discharge and have had it for awhile (monthly). Anyway it is likley to be an infection in a gland or duct. I have been given antibiotics but they have not worked. I am going to see a breast surgen to have a biopsy. I would not worry because what I have read is that it is most liikley not cancer and it just needs to get taken care of. I did a search on the web of nipple discharge and got a lot of information. Give in a try. Good Luck and most of all God Bless.",
