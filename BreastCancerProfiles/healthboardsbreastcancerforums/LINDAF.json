      "Content": "I Had my lumpectomy today....the dr. told my husband it wasn't a fibroid but a \"mass\" which I don't understand and can't call him until tomorrow to find out exactly what it was. He also removed 2 cysts and I am in much more pain this time than the last. The surgery also took about 1 1/2 hours, which he thought it would only take about 30 minutes. I suppose my question is...what is the difference between a mass or fibroid and if there was any question about it being benign, wouldn't he have told my husband there was a chance it could be cancerous? It felt exactly like the fibroid I had in my left and it was a bit bigger than a walnut he said. I'm just confused (and still very groggy) I guess. Any thoughts are greatly appreciated.",

      "Content": "Hi. I'm a 38 year old female and had a lumpectomy about 5 yrs ago to remove a fibroid tumor that was large, but benign. The surgeon and my GYN said I would have to have a core biopsy every six months or have it removed. They couldn't tell me that they were 100% sure it was benign so I chose to have it removed. Since then, I've had to have a yearly mammogram and I do monthly exams myself. About a year and a half ago I found another lump in my right breast with the same \"feel\" as the one in the left. Last year I had a call back to have another mammogram because something was abnormal in the left, and never said anything about the right. I was so relieved I figured if there was something in the right they would have raised the issue. My results this time were there is a mass, and I can feel it and it is large, but it is benign. I talked to my GYN and he thinks I should be seen by my surgeon since I'm high risk, and again they cannot tell me with certainty it isn't cancerous, but the person who read the mammogram said the lump was there last mammo but there was no change and to just come back next yr for my yearly mammogram. I have 2 children almost 7 and 8 and I'm afraid that that it may turn into something else, but if i wait a yr it may be too late, etc. I know this is long, but I don't know what to do and I don't want to seem as though I'm overreacting. Any thoughts would be GREATLY appreciated. Thank You",

I am relieved and will be having the lumpectomy on March 19th. Will update after then. Best wishes to all",

      "Content": "I'm considered high risk because I had a previous lumpectomy, and people with fibroid tumors are more likely to get breast cancer than those that haven't. I can't \"live\" with it because I don't want to have live every day knowing the tumor, though for now it is benign, could at any time be cancer, or even not getting an absolute positive answer from the person that reviewed the results or my GYN or surgeon that it is definately not malignant. I appreciate your replies..I think I am just going to do what my Gyn suggested and see the surgeon and probably have it removed....I agree that Drs. are human and make mistakes now and then and I don't want to be a statistic.",

      "Content": "The information I recieved about the fact that women with fibroadenomas are more likely to get breast cancer was in 2002 right after I had my lumpectomy, and it was given to me from my surgeon when he was stressing why it was so important for me to get the yearly mammogram and stick with it. I have also read recently that Fibroadenomas, Though they have no malignant potential, differentiating them from other malignant tumors on physical exam at times can be difficult and thus palpable fibroadenomas should be excised. If the lump wasn't so large and my breasts weren't so \"dense\" then I would probably let it go...lol...as for the biopsy every 6 months, ouch! They would excise a part of the tumor with a core needle and pull some of it out. That would probably cause just as much scarring, if not more and more time at the dr. than I have time to put in, I would think than having it removed, and again..ouch! lol thanks for the input. Will let you know how the meeting with the surgeon goes.",

      "Content": "I was just referred to an oncologist to have a \"Gail Model\" done. I have had 2 lumpectomies in 5 years, both were benign fibroids, and the latest with hyperplasia and cysts. I have had greenish discharge from my nipples for years when doing self exams, but lately it is seeping out onto my bra. I'm 38 yrs old and was wondering if anyone else has ever had this problem or has had the Gail model done without ever having malignancy. Thanks, Linda",
