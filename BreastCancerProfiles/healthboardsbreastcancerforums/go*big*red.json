      "Content": "They found 2 \"significant\" changes from my last mamo to this most recent one done last week. The one I could actually see with my untrained eye and knew I would be called back for another film and ultra sound on that one, but the 2nd of 2 changes was a surprise. However, the dr. couldn't feel anything upon examination. Do you think this is a good sign? I'm just a \"Little\" concerned and obsessing on this - bad me. My mom has won the battle with colon/rectal cancer for 3 years but I saw what she went through. I lost a friend to breast cancer this year, an aunt from ovarian cancer again this year and so I just can't stop thinking about this. I will know the results tomorrow afternoon - will it ever get here or will it be too soon?????? Geezo. Thanks",

      "Content": "Hi, Nancy Thanks for responding. The one mass dissipated with compression, the one closest to my chest wall did not. They had trouble locating it via ultra sound because it was so deep. Did finally find it, though and it looks like a cluster of cysts on top of each other. The options were to wait 3 months and do another ultra sound to see if there were any changes, then another 3 months, etc. or biopsy as he is really unsure as to what it is or what it/they look like. So, the biopsy is scheduled for Thursday at 10:30 mst as it was hard enough for me to wait until this Tuesday, let alone ANOTHER 3 MONTHS???!!! I don't think so! Anyway, thanks again for your input. BTW, what was the exact results on your biopsy? He said if it comes back \"negative\" it means that it showed normal breast tissue and that is NOT the answer we want because it means he didn't get a good core. It needs to come back benign tissue of some sort or worse case scenario malignant something or other, but not negative. Thursday morning, here I come",

      "Content": "Hi, Nancy I'm not sure what my biopsy was called, but it is great that yours was benign. I should hear results either tomorrow afternoon or Monday. So....more waiting. The biopsy itself was not too bad. Alot of pain on the first pass so he put more medication in and the second I didn't feel a thing, but the third he hit a nerve or the muscle that goes in my armpit. OW!!! Because he tried to get behind it (first was on top, then underneath) and hit my chest wall because it was so close. So, he went to the side then because of the pain. The instrument he used is cutting edge (no pun intended). You don't pierce the mass itself, just get vaguely close and then turn the thing on and it sucks the sample right up. So there's not the possibility of loosing the mass because you puncture it and it goes away for a time. He got 3 real good tissue samples. Then he inserted a metal marker in case they had to get more or if it is cancerous the surgeon won't have to guess where it is/was. Did they do that with you? I haven't had any pain since except when the medication was wearing off, then it was a deep sharp pain, but now even that's gone. I have a high pain tolerance, though, I think due to my back issues. Anyway - thanks again for corresponding. I'll let you know the outcome. Cindy",

      "Content": "Hi, again, Nancy Dr. called me yesterday afternoon and althought they found some \"very interesting\" things in the biopsy, none of it was malignant. I was at lunch in a restaurant when he called my cell phone so I didn't feel comfortable asking what the \"very interesting\" things were that they found. I may call my gyn office and get a copy of the report. Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh - *big sigh of relief!* BTW, I was on my back for the procedure so it may have been different than yours. I dunno. Also, is it normal for the incision to be oozing a little? No stitches however he did say a \"small nick\" in my breast but a 3/4\" incision does not sound like a small nick to me! Thanks for all your support and prayers. I know they helped. Cindy",
