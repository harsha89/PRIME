    "Content": "Hello, I just received the same results on my mammogram. I went into a panic, being a 5 1/2 year Breast cancer survivor. My radiation oncologist called me to tell me that it's considered a benign condition, that should be monitored. I was so relieved to here that! I'm going to my surgeon for further evaluation. I just wish the internet had more information on mammogram results etc... Good luck and take care Kinini",
