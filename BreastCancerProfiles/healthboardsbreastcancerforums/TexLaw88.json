      "Content": "So relieved! My mother in law battled stage 4 last year and won, until about a month ago when she was dx'd with skin cancer. And just last week, my mom got a call for architectural distortion, but she doesn't go back until the 20th. Its been a terrible last week or so. I am a Media Spokesperson and Pink Pledge Pal for the Houston Affiliate of Komen and I was envisioning becoming a story myself.......I was supposed to go for my annual in Feb but put it off till August. I will never put it off again!! Have a great day, Sharon!",

      "Content": "I have a second mammo and possible ultrasound scheduled for tomorrow morning. Went for my annual mammo a week ago and received the following results: Average residual fibroglandular tissue is present bilaterally. In the upper outer quadrant of the right breast, asymmetric parenchymal density is present representing a change from prior exam and in the left breast, 2 partially obscured densities are visualized, best seen on the MLO view, also representing a change. Further eval of this bilateral findings is recommended with focal spot compression imaging and lateral projection imaging to be followed by ultrasound if needed. Birad: 0 Incomplete Recommend additional imaging and possible ultrasound of both breasts. About 8 months ago, I started noticing pain in my left breast, though it seemed to always be about a week or so before my period. It gets so bad, just brushing that side of my breast can be painful (and I have a high pain tolerance). No history of breast cancer, though my maternal grandmother died of cervical cancer. And in an ironic twist, my mother got her annual mammo report two days before me and has to return for additional screening due to architechtural distortion. I am very scared. My husband wants to go with me. I am hopeful that the \"two densities\" are just cysts. Any info you can send would be great. Thank you!",

      "Content": "Thanks Uptown! I went this morning, with hubby. They took me right away. Did three pics on both sides (yes, its digital) and had me stay while the radiologist read them. I got nervous when they called me back into the room, but it was just so the tech could tell me the radiologist was satisfied with the photos and he thought everything looked fine - just dense. WHAT A RELIEF! The last few days have been so stressful, thinking the worst. Thanks for responding!!!",
