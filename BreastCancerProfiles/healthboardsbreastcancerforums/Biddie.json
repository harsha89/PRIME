No chemo is planned. I am already on hormone therapy--Arimidex. My various doctors all urge radiation since it would help prevent recurrence in that breast. But radiation does not increase survival rate. I'm worried about the side effects of radiation--lung scarring, fragile ribs, who knows what else. All my naturapath friends say no to radiation, of course. All my mainstream friends assume a yes. I seem to be trapped in the middle ground. Anybody out there who can help or who has gone through this? Would really appreciate hearing from another agonizer about this decision. (Also, has anyone had experiencw with a prone breast board? that's one in which the patient lies face down, breasts going through some cut-outs, thus reducing the amount of radiation to internal organs, etc.) Atid I had the same size cancer (twice). The second cancer returned in the same spot as the first six years later after being on Tamoxfin for five years. Following the second breast cancer I chose to undergo radiation in our state's major city some 1,000km from my country town. Eight years have past since then, I am no longer on any of the usual breast cancer preventitive drugs, I have my yearly mammograns and check breasts regularly. To prevent the effects of burn to the skin from radiation use 100% Aloe Vera clear gel as soon after the treatment as possible. Before starting take large doses of the vitamin B group. Yes, it is a shock to the body and is a drawn out process. Having to get to the hospital daily, then waiting for your two minute treatment, I know it was worth it. Most important is have someone with you, friends are good medicene.",
