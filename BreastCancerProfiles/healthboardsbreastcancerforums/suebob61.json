      "Content": "I am interested in what you decided regarding Tamoxifen. I, too, am 49, had a bilateral mastectomy, six cycles of chemo, ongoing Herceptin, and my oncologist just prescribed Tamoxifen. It seems unnecessary given that my lymph nodes are negative, the tumor margins were clear, and I'm taking Herceptin. She claims it will lower my cholesterol and increase bone density, but both are good right now. She also said the studies regarding Tamoxifen following Herceptin won't be out for several more years. I'm thinking of bailing on the Tamoxifen. What have you done?",

      "Content": "Thank you for the really great information. It seems that Tamoxifen is not really necessary (for me), but I've got the prescription and I'm trying to decide if I want to start taking it. I realize my oncologist knows more than I do, but, as you said, intuitively it doesn't seem necessary. Best of luck to you with the Lupron--and with everything else.",
