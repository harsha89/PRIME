    "Content": "Hello, im 18 years old and i have found a small lumb higher up on my right breast. ive noticed this lump before mostly at around \"that time of the mounth\". but im not supposed to start till another week or two. so im not sure if this lump could just be a sign of my menstration or something else. and i have noticed that when i rub it it hurts a little and strangley enough it moves a little. i am planing on going to the doctors sooner or later but this has just really been bothering me and i was wondering if anyone could give me adive or tell me of a similar situation they had.",
