    "Content": "My mother had a screening mammogram and 2 weeks later received a letter , had to go for \"further assessment\" Where they did a magnified look followed by an ultrasound and than Core biopsy. She had some microcalcifications in both breasts but one cluster of them in the right breast above the nipple. The ultrasound showed that it was a simple cyst with calcifications around it. They said that they think it is probably fybrocystic changes. My mother is 53 years old. There was no mass or lump. But they wanted to do a biopsy to make sure and they gave her rating 3 ?? Indeterminate ?? She had the biopsy On Tuesday last week and the nurse made an appointment for her to come back the following Tuesday for the results , they do not give the results over the phone my mother was told. However the nurse called today and said that my mums biopsy results are not going to be back tomorrow and she rebooked her appointment for this Friday as they will have the result by than she said. I called the nurse back after my mum told me this and asked the nurse why is it taking extra time why aren't the results back is it bad has it been sent for a Second opinion maybe or what is the reason does It mean it is bad if it's taking this long. She told me that the GoldCoast hospital lab had a \"back logg\" and my mum isn't the only one whose results haven't come back and that she had to reschedule other womens appointments for Friday as well. But I am Still so worried I can not sleep or eat and worry every second. Me and my mother are very close and to be honest she is all I have and my son. Can someone please tell me how long do these biopsy results take and does it mean it is bad if they are taking extra time ?? Thank you everyone",
