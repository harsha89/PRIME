    "Content": "Hello, I had stage 2, Her2nu+, no nodes, invasive ductal carcenoma 2 years ago, at the age of 34. I chose to have a bilateral mastectomy due to my family history of breast cancer. I had tissue expanders and silicone implant reconstruction. A few months ago I felt a really small lump on the breast that did not have cancer. I had an ultrasound and MRI, nothing was found. I have been feeling it, it has gotten a little bit bigger. We have recently moved so all my dr's are new. I called my previous surgeon and she said it is very unlikly to be a second primay. My new surgeon wants to do an incisional biopsy, I am not sure what to do. Has anyone had a second primary after mastectomy? Thanks in advance for any info. Ellabella",
