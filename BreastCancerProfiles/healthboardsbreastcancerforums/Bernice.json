      "Content": "I'm 43 years old and have a lump under my armpit. I'm going to the doctor's tomorrow. I have a mammogram every year. I'm due for my yearly mammogram in May. Breast cancer does not run in my family. I've checked my breast and didn't find any lumps. I'm nervous. Is it possible to get breast cancer without finding a lump in the breast but only in the armpit? I read that a lump can be from an infection such as a scratch. Can you get a lump from shaving your armpit? I never had any problems before. But then again I had my first abnormal pap (which turned out to be OK), now this. I'm really nervous. Any information will be appreciated. Thank You, Bernice",

I'm having my yearly mammogram in May and she wants me to go back to her that week and if this lump is still there, she'll send me to a specialist and maybe have a biopsy done on it. Isn't 6 weeks too long to wait and not do anything? Is there anything I can do to help it go away? I'm not going to shave as much under my arm. I shave every other day. Maybe I'll shave once a week. She said it's like when you have a cold and the lymph nodes in your neck swells. That's just like under your arm. I really never heard that your lumph nodes under your arm can swell (causing a lump) from shaving. Anyone heard of that? I never had any problems before. I just hope this lump goes away. Bernice",

She said she doesn't think it's anything to worry about and to come back for a follow up after I have my mammogram. I had my mammogram on monday and went to her today. The mammogram came back negative but the lump is still there. She said she doesn't think it's anything to worry about but she's sending me to a specialist for a second opinion. I'm a nervous wreck. Can mammograms detect lumps under to arms? These lumps don't really feel like lumps. They feel more like muscles. They're not round. They are more long (like when I press on it, I can feel it as I move my finger along my armpit. This is in both of my arms but one isn't as bad as the other. Any suggestions on what it could be?

Findings: Ultrasound reveals 3 small cysts in the medial tissues of the left breast, one in the upper quadrant, one in the mid portion, and one in the lower quadrant. These appear benigh, although the margins of the upper and mid breast cysts are a bit irregular with poosible septations. These are all small measuring about 3-4 mm in size. No focal solid lesions are demonstrated sonographically. Impression: Three tiny cysts in the medial tissues of the left breast. At least one of these most likely accounts for the new density seen there on the resent mammograms. Because of the irregular cyst contours and possible septations in 2 of these cysts, 6-month surveillance sonography and mammograms of the left breast are recommended. Do you know what septation means? Why wouldn't they want me to come back sooner? Bernice",

      "Content": "On 5/29/10 I had a yearly mammogram. I'm 46 years old and all my mammograms came back normal. I picked up the report for this mammogram and I'm a nervous wreck. This is what it says: Findings: Dense and hetergenous breast parenchyma is again observed with minor asymmetry. Allowing for some differences of technique and positioning, there is an apparent new 7 mm irregular density in the medial tissues of the left breast seen on the craniocaudal view. This cannot be identified on previous exams. Repeat craniocaudal view as well as spot compression views are advised to see if this persists. No pathologic calcifications. Impression: New 7 mm density medially in left breast which needs further imaging evalution as discussed above. Does anyone know what this means? I called my doctor who hasn't called me back yet. In October 2009, I had a hysterectomy with both ovaries removed and been on the patch (vivelle-dot) since my hysterectomy. I'm on the lowest dose .05. Could this patch have something to do with this? Isn't 7 mm big? Any information will be appreciated. Thank you Bernice",

The radiologist wants the one view repeated to see if the density is still there and the spot film is to cone down to the area and compress it to see if they can identify it. Do not be surprised if they also request an ultrasound of the area, this will let them know if the density is solid or liquid. Good luck with the repeat exam and let me know how you do. Brenda Thank you for your reply. What is a \"density\"? Is it a mass? I'm going back tomorrow for another mammogram. The radiologist will look at it there and if they see anything, they'll do an ultrasound. I'm a nervous wreck especially if they want to do an ultrasound. Bernice",

Having an ultrasound is far better than sticking a needle in to find out the density is only fluid. I understand you are nervous--I have been in that situation numerous times, and it does not get any easier. I will be thinking of you tomorrow--let me know how everything turns out. Brenda Thank you.
