      "Content": "WOW I should of come to this heathboard along time ago! I tried Arimidex for a DAY! I was so tired and achy, I could barely move around.. I thought i was going goofy! it was almost ..almost worse than chemo. I tried going back on Tamoxfin... and quit that too. Im slight estrogen positive..had my ovaries removed due to the bracII gene. So im not sure how big a risk it is to not take it. My dr. thinks i should take it..I just dont know. I really dont want to live like that...tired and crummy every day but what are my options right??",
