    "Content": "I hope you got that checked out. My nipple wasn't bleeding but it was cracking and flaking with a clear discharge. Turned out it was breast cancer and I had just had a normal mammo less than a yr before diagnosis. Dr couldn't find lump upon examination but it was there when new mammo was done. I know there are other reasons nipples will have a discharge but you need to get it checked out if you haven;'t already. My cancer was a fast growing cancer. Fortunately after surgery and 6 mos. of chemo, I am here to see my grandchildren grow up. God bless!",
