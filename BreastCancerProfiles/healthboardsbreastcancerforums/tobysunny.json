      "Content": "HI! I am glad to hear from you. Sounds like we both feel some better. It kind of puts life into prospective very fast! And that I hate to say it but, it is a Blessing in disquise. I don't how the speller works on this! :dizzy And why I can't get those cute little faces! LOL! I have diagnostic mamo. w/ an ultasnd. Monday at 2/00pm. I live where there is a big Cancer center. Breast is their speciality. I still am trying to read everything that I can get my hands on. You know what I mean... I have to be able to wrap my head around this intellectually. That way I feel like I have some control over what happens to me. I bet you get your results tomorrow. I don't know my way around the message boards and I hope I can find you when you tell me the results are all negative!: I will hunt around for your mane and our topic. Maybe that is the trick to this! Let's throw up a prayer for each other! tobysunny!",
