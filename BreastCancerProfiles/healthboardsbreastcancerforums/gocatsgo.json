    "Content": "I was just passing through here checking out some info from a friend. I do not have breast cancer, but have just finished 5 rounds of Xeloda for colorectal cancer. The two biggest side effects for me were sore feet and hands (bag balm helps tremendously) and diarrhea (for which I took Lomotil). I did find that I needed to have a good meal in me before I took the pills, otherwise I became incredibly nauseated. I would then munch on peanut butter crackers to keep from getting sick. Usually this feeling went away after 30 minutes or so. Compared to infusions (which made me VERY sick) this was much more tolerable. I was often tired (red counts low), but I was still able to function pretty well...tried to nap daily. Best of luck to you and your wife. Hope this info helps! Take care",
