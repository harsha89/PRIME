    "Content": "Hi everyone, Freaking out a little, I am 26, never had a pap smear, too embarrassed, and I am in between periods at the moment, last week I bled lightly all week, with a strange discharge (sorry too much info I know), then stopped for a day and have started again, starting with the discharge then turned into bleeding, and this is very unusual I am generally spot on everytime, so of course my mind start to go abit wild, so thought I would come on here and have you guys put my mind to rest. This is probably just a coincidence, but I have also noticed the bleeding started this time after having an orgasm (there was no penetration this time, so figure its got nothing to do with it, but last time it started was after an orgasm too, probably useless info, but it just seems it could possibly be related. Can someone help me out maybe put my mind to rest. Thank you heaps",
