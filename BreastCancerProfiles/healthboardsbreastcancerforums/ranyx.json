    "Content": "Hey, my name is Jose, Im a 20 years old male Yesterday I brushed my left breast with my hand and suddenly felt some pain which weirded me out. So, I went to the bathroom and checked myself in the mirror, there I discovered that a lump appeared to the right of my left nipple. It wasn't there yesterday. This lump is red, its hard to the touch and its almost as big as my nipple. It is round and it is slightly redder in the center of it; it is hot to the touch. The pain appears as soon as theres pressure on it. Theres another small lump under my nipple, it is hard to the touch, but it is not as big as the other one and it does´t hurt as much. Also, it isn't as hot as the other one. So, I decided to wait, maybe it was a bug bite or an allergic reaction, but they´re still there! 24 hours later! I´m kinda worried. Any ideas what this little ball is??",
