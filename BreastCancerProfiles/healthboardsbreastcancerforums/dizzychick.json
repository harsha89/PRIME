      "Content": "i have a question for you all. i had a diagnostic mammo done and showed a cluster of cysts, however there is one that is not consistent with the others and i now need to go to the susan cheek breast center. anyway i not only have slight breast pain, but the right side of my back is killing me. does anyone know what i'm talking about? oh, i also have a soft lump in my right armpit that my doc told me on 3 different occasions that it was a muscle. now she wants me to see a surgeon. so, to sum it up, i'm having right breast and armpit pain and right back pain that feels like a stabbing pain. thanks for any response.",
