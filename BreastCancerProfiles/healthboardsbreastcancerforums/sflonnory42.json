    "Content": "Hi, I am 42 years old and I had my mammogram done on November 20, 2008 and the results came back as follows, your recent mammogram performed has shown that further tests are being recommended by the Radiologist. I went back for the further testing on December 18, 2008 and those results came back saying the same thing, that further testing are needed, now I am worried. What do you think all of this means? I received my results by certified mail.",
