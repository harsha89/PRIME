    "Content": "Hi, Just came back from a core biopsy. Results won't be in for a week. My mammogram and ultrasound report states I have a 2.3 cm hypoechoic, with no cystic or solid mass. I don't have the full report, but that was what I remembered. I'm 37, no history of breast cancer, and found the lump a few weeks ago. Mammogram/ultrasound was last week and today was the core biopsy. I'm worried and just need someone to explain to me what that means? Please help me......... Thanks, Kg.",
