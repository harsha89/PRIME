      "Content": "Dear Sister: It has been 24 hours since I last posted to you to GET ON THE HORN and call a doctor. Have you done this? DO NOT WAIT. If you need help, I will drive down and take you there myself. I do not know where you live in PA., But Foxx Chase Cancer Hospital in Philly was my second opinion. I can give you names and phone numbers if you would like. The only reason I did not have the surgery there (in Philly)was because it was too far from where I am currently living (Maine). Now quiet me down a bit and let me know you have made the first appointment................Mary",

      "Content": "Sister: I had the same thing happen to me! Do not be scared! You need to act immediatley. Get an appointment with a reputable breast cancer clinic - and do not panic - it may take a few weeks to get in there - but DO IT NOW. I found the lump in January - my gyno dicked around with it and finally in March I went to a cancer center. They operated April 1st AND GOT ALL OF IT! You will be fine - just get on the phone girl - you need to ACT! Mary",
