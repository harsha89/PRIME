    "Content": "On my right areola I see what appears to be a raised area like a lump, but when I touch it, there's nothing there. If I close my eyes and inspect each breast at the same time, they feel indentical. Even if I rub in a circular motion all the way down, I feel nothing. The appearance of this started after I stopped nursing my son. Can anyone tell me what this may be. Are breast lumps common on the areola?",
