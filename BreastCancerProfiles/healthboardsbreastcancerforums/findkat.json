    "Content": "A couple of months ago i found a pea sized lump in my left breast, after going through all the normal procedures I am now at the stage where they have taken a sample and it has come back with the result 3 - which I believe means not necessarily cancerous but not benign either. I am due to have this lump taken out on the 9th of November, however it has recently started growing and I've been getting weird pains in my chest - feels like they are coming from behind the lump. I am quite concerned as when they took a sample of the lump it was blood inside which I think means they can rule out cysts, blocked milk ducts etc. Is anyone else in the same situation? I'm worried but feel a bit dramatic if I talk about it to anyone. [ removed ]",
