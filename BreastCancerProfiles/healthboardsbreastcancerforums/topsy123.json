      "Content": "Hi, I had a mammogram five days ago. Today I received a letter in the post asking me to go back on Monday. This is my first mammogram and whilst I realise some woman get called back especially from their first one, I didn't expect to get a recall so quick. They said they have the results, albeit they haven't said what those results are, but that I need a second stage screening. Should I be concerned? I feel concerned that it was only five days ago and now they want me back there in the next five days. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.",

      "Content": "Hi everyone, I was diagnosed around five weeks ago with breast cancer. Lobular grade 2, left breast. I have undergone many tests since then just to make sure it hasn't metastised as certain aches and pains were investigated. I'm pleased to say it hasn't and and booked in to have a mastectomy in two weeks time, radiotherapy to follow, possible chemo. I am fifty years of age, my sister is fifty three. She was sent to have a mammogram a few days ago after she alerted the GP to a rather painful lump in her breast. She has had cysts drained before so no shock there. She went along and yes she had another cyst, however they also detected a mass. They drained the cyst and biopsied the mass. She went private, hence the quick turn around. She has now also been diagnosed with breast cancer, just five weeks after my diagnosis. Our grandmothers on both sides of the family had breast cancer, although they were much older when it was detected. One had one breast removed, the other one had both breasts removed. There surely has to be a link here? Either that or we must be extremely unlucky. But to find that only five weeks apart being diagnosed with exactly the same cancer, same breast, the odds on that must be rare, or is it? Has anyone else known of this? Or are we pure and simple just plain unlucky? Thank for reading and would love to hear opinions.",

      "Content": "Hi, had my first mammogram a few weeks ago. I'm fifty years old. I got called back five days later for a second screening. I was told this is quite normal for woman who had only ever had their first one, as they had nothing to compare tissue wise. I went back five days later for the appointment. Much to my horror they said we have to do another mammogram. Now don't get me wrong, I'm sure each woman's experience with this is different, but I found the whole process to be more uncomfortable than painful and it is over relatively quickly. This time they took more images and being at the time of month that my cycle was on it's way, my breasts were very very tender and sore. So this time the experience was not so good, but I got in with it. I was then told, I had to have an ultrasound. So I popped into another room and duly changed again ready for that. Before we started the head radiographer came in and said they had detected an area of my left breast that weren't happy with. She said we have also detected another two areas in your right breast that needs investigating to. She performed the ultra sound and then said due to the fact she clearly wasn't happy with the images in my left breast they wanted to now do five biopsies. All the time I'm lying there I'm thinking this is not real and no I dont want those giant long needles in their trolley coming anywhere near me. But you sit there glued to the bed knowing this has to be done. It was actually a pretty much painless procedure. I was told to sit for a while longer whilst they then patched up my punctured boobs up with dressings. I was told don't get up, they would bring me a cuppa and just relax. Relax...ha ha ha. I can't even begin to relay what was going through my mind. The staff were lovely and very kind. After a while I was allowed to get dressed. I was then told the breast consultant would be along to talk to me. He was unfortunately called off site so I didn't get to see him. After some hanging around I was asked to go into another room where by I was met with two different types of nurses. They said the results of the biopsies would be back next week, however they felt it only right to discuss their findings at this stage. They clearly stated that they are 99% if not more sure that this is Breast cancer in my left breast. I said but the results haven't even come back yet. They said we are so sure at this stage that is is, we would NEVER sit you down and tell you this or discuss with you what the future plans of treatment are depending on the type of cancer it is. I said what about the right side, they said they are concerned but not anywhere near as concerned as they are for the left side. They carried on talking and all I wanted to do was get out of there and escape. This was not happening to me. But it was and we discussed lots of things. We talked about a lumpectomy and a full mastectomy. But this will all depend on how the results come in and what the consultant suggests. They explained a lot and again re iterated they would NOT do this if they felt they weren't sure. They said they are so sure that If the results came back negative they would biopsy again. A lot more was said and explained so I was clear where everyone was going with this. I was given a cancer nurse who I met and can now contact twenty for seven who will answer my every question and be there if I need her. I had no questions at this point, I felt numb, pretty dazed and on the verge of a full blown panic attack. god knows how I managed to keep it together. So now I'm sat here and thinking what on earth is going to happen to me. I am told surgery is a definite and I will be in pretty quickly after next weeks appointment with the consultant surgeon. I have no idea how I am meant to feel, I do feel something but most of the time but I can't even describe it. I'm not crying, or sobbing. I am worried for sure but I'm not even sure what I'm worried about. It's all happened so quickly, it's like being hit with a lightening bolt. I know what they have said but I keep thinking maybe I have heard them wrong. So much so my partner works at the hospital and went up there yesterday and said can I just ask again, did we hear right? They said yes. Has anyone experienced this feeling of something I clearly cant put into words? I genuinely don't know how to feel. I am scared but I keep thinking it's not actually going to happen so why be scared. How stupid does that sound? but that's what keeps going through my head. I feel like I've had no real time to take it all in. Everyone around me is in shock and I'm saying it will be fine, don't worry. Apologies for rambling on but I have no idea what to think or how to genuinely feel. I thought I would be in floods of tears but I'm not!",

      "Content": "Hi , I have a few questions and would be so grateful if anyone could advise. Three weeks ago I had a left side radical mastectomy. Grade2 lobular breast cancer. Got through surgery as well as one can. I went for reconstruction at the same time and glad I did. Was given antibiotics on discharge from hospital to take for a week and had two drains in. Over the the days that followed I had the drains removed and a few follow up wound appointments to check how I was doing. All going well. Mentally I felt great even though I am naturally very sore. I realise it's still early days and I'm still wearing the god awful corset bra to keep it all compressed and in place. Have had a few appointment to pump up the new boob and getting it pumped up again tomorrow. They say it's to stretch the skin. I was then referred to an oncologist who said the tumour was so large in my left breast that radiotherapy was out of the question due to the targeted location. I could end up with cardio problems. They are not sure right now if I need chemo, I am waiting another week for the results on that one. I was doing fine when suddenly three days ago I felt so so low and depressed. My anxiety has been going through the roof and I'm in total despair. I have gone off my food and am eating very little. My stools were firm and I noticed I suddenly had to go, but it seemed OK apart from the urgency. Now I have full blown diarrhoea and yes even more urgency. My stomach is churning and I'm unsure what to do. I'm constantly lying in front of a fan as I'm hot. But I do have an overwhelming fear that comes across me and then I get hot. Then in between I'm pretty cold and can't warm up. I don't think I have a temperature, I'm just feeling pretty horrendous. I was on HRT before the cancer was discovered and was duly told to stop it straight away. I went on HRT because I was having so many hot flushes and panic attacks. Never had a panic attack in my life but suddenly in the throws of this menopause I find myself becoming a wreck, so the HRT was a god send and made me feel myself again. Now I find myself back to where I was before all this and desperate to know what to do. I do take 20 mg of citalopram each day and have done for a while, but that's helping very little. I am told in a week or so I have to start taking Tamoxifen and I'm dreading it. I have read so much about the side effects of this drug and the depression and anxiety it can give. I have all that now and don't want to add to it, but also realise it may be a life saver in the long run. Can anyone advise me here firstly on the diarrhoea and secondly on whether anyone else who has gone through this experiencing the same low mood post surgery. Also Tamoxifen and how do I get my head round that...many thanks to you all for reading.",

      "Content": "Hi MSNik, I have been meaning to reply to your post for some time seeing as you took the trouble to reply to mine. But, life has got in the way and a lot has happened since my original posting. Firstly I want to say thank you for taking the time to reply and offer good advice and kind words. My mammogram has revealed cancer as I previously stated and as time was going on I was in my own way getting my head around the fact that either a lumpectomy or a mastectomy would happen. However things never go to plan. I had a an MRI of the breasts and that confirmed the breast cancer, I also had a CT full body scan. So last Thursday I see the consultant who now tells me they have detected a lesion on my rib and on my spine. They are not to concerned with the ribs but like the first time round when they were sure it was cancer before the results were even confirmed they have said the same this time. They are very sure it's secondries on the spine. So now I have to have a bone scan to reveal the extent ther. Breast surgery I have been told will be put in hold as this is more important to treat. My post said it all, \"unknown territory \" and my thoughts are driving me insane. We all know this can be treated but no cured if it is the case and that has devastated us all. Tell me how do you cope? You have MS yet you offer such wise and kind words to others who are suffering. Your diagnosis I'm sure was devastating to you when you were told, how do you carry on? cause right now I'm not sure how I will. I see loved ones and friends heartbroken and yet I feel guilty for causing them to feel so sad. I'm not ready to go and I don't want to go but how do I fight something that cannot be cured? Again, I'm sorry to vent but it's night time, and it's the worst time for me right now. My mind plays tricks and wanders into the darkest places...hugs to you and thank you.",
