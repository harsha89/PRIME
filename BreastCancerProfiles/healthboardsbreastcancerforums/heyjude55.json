      "Content": "thanks Julie. I am putting the cart before the horse because I still need the ultrasound tomorrow before any biopsy but I read before where someone on this site waited a long time for biopsy results-that would make me totally bonkers. Just so much runs thru your mind-I am supposed to leave for vacation w/ my husband on Tues for 2 wks & wonder how I will feel about that if they let me know anything from the ultrasound... I am so sorry to hear your biopsy results were positive but glad they downgraded it. Hearing from those going thru this is really wonderful-glad I found this site-makes you feel as though you are not alone and not totally nuts.",

She said the estrogen, stored in the fat cells, is released upon weight loss.",
