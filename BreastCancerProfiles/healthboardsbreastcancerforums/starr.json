      "Content": "Hi everybody. I just turned 43 and I had my first mammogram. Then they called me back for a magnified picture. They say I have calcifications in one breast, some in clusters, some round, a few odd shaped. Now they tell me I should have a stereotactic core biopsy. They are indeterminate. So, searching the web, i find much info, most calcifications are not cancer. It could be a possible sign of early cancer. %50 women over 50 have them, %10 under 50 have them. %80-%90 can be nothing. Some DR's wait for a few months and see if they changed, and do another magnified mammo. Does anyone have any experience with this? I have panic and Gad and this is not helping my mind. I am very scared but trying to think positive. My mom had BC after menopause, 57, and it was a slow growing tumor. It came back in the same place, but then she was cancer free for 10 yrs. Now it came back a few years back, but her whole health was decling anyway because of strokes. Now she has dementia and cognitive problems and is blind, sometimes delusional. She found a lump. I have no lump, but I guess that doesn't matter when it comes to cancer. If it is the BIG C would it have been caught real early? Does anyone know anything???? Help!!! Or, lets look at the glass half full, and say they are benign. Thanks in advance for any replies or opinions, or experiences. My biopsy will be next Thursday(yeah, they give you a week to panic more!!)The radiologist said if it was his wife he would get the stereotactic biopsy Help, has anyone had this done?? Bye for now Wendy BTW Happy holidays! Any positive outcomes with microcalcifications?",

      "Content": "Hello, I wish I could be more help, but I am going through this process right now. (I spelled calcifications wrong on my topic). I believe that every radiologist has their own interpretation, and their perferred treatment or diagnostic tests. I don't know anything about Atypical microcalcifications. I guess I'll know better next week. I don't blame you for being worried, I have panic and anxiety, so I know what it is like. I wish I knew more to ease your mind. I'll just pray for both of us. Bye for now Wendy",

      "Content": "Well, I'm having my sterotactic core biopsy tommorrow, really scared. I read on the internet that microcalcifications are not cancer in itself. Is this true?? I have no lumps or masses, its just when they magnified that area they saw a few clusters(i've been hit in that boob many times growin up..sports), and they said they saw a few cells that were odd shaped. Do I have to worry?? Help!!! There are no calcifications in the other boob. I'll let you guys know, Wendy",
