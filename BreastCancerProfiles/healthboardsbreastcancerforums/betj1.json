    "Content": "Definitely keep a close eye on it until after your period. It may be a cyst filling up with fluid that will go down after your period. Also examine how it feels. Is it totally hard, or sort of rubbery. Does it move when you manipulate it or is it firmly attached. Benign lumps are usually more tender, softer, and move around under the skin more. But if it doesn't go away get it checked out and get a sonogram/mammogram.",
