    "Content": "I was searching details and stumbled upon this topic Knowing I am SEVERAL months past your posting date I thought I would post some details as well just in case there are other people searching the same topic. I went in for my regular annual physical 2 weeks ago. My doctor said my uterus felt bulky - just like she has said every year for the past 3 or 4 years now. Coupled together with a very heavy period every month and lots of clotting as well (sorry to be gross) I have tried to take the pill to help with heavyness of my period to no success. Taking the pill either did not work or it made me fill very sick. Last week I went for an ultrasound both a regular ultrasound as well as a trans vaginal. I received a call from the doctor last week wanting to talk to me about the results of the ultrasounds. I am not sure what they found, but since the Doctor wants to see me I am assuming there is something there she is not 100% comfortable with. I have been talking to some other women who have been in somewhat similar situations as myself and have ended up getting a hysterectomy (sp??) - Part of me is interested in knowing more about my possible option with this so I can be done with this whole thing. I am done with having kids, and the issues I have every month I am thinking are probably worth the operation. For the other ladies who have already posted, I hope all went (or is going) well for you with your situation. Perhaps it would be a good thing to continue to post on here for future references for other women.",
