      "Content": "I'm happy to hear yours was caught early. Was it DCIS? That's what they told me was likely, if it is malignant. But the surgeon today seemed to think it was likely benign. So I feel a bit better after talking with her. I don't know how much they're going to take out.....b/c it's segmented, there are no distinct borders. They got me in tomorrow......and I'm glad it's so soon. Not looking forward to the wire localizatin part.....did you have that? I'd rather just be asleep for the whole dang thing. Carla, did you find anything out today?",

      "Content": "Carla, is there any way you can get your report from them? I don't know if they'll tell you over the phone about the results so far. Mine wouldn't. I have done some research on calcifications the last couple of weeks, but without knowing what they found, it's hard to even speculate. I do know that most suspicious calcifications are benign. AND......I got my call last night. Mine are BENIGN! So I can breath again. I am sorry you are having to wait all this time for something to be done. The fact that they want more pictures isn't to me a bad thing. If they were certain everything looked suspicious, they would go straight to the biopsy, I would think. Keep us posted!",

If they are clustered (I'm assuming they are or you wouldn't be going for biopsy) or linear, or segmented in distribution? And what shape they are? I found a lot of info. online, knowing this about mine.",

They told me I should have the results Friday. Hoping that is so and I don't have to wait for the weekend. Let us know when you get a biopsy date. Keeping you all in prayer. Dee",

      "Content": "I'd appreciate any insight or experiences anyone has with this...... I had a mammogram, which showed a suspicious area--calcifications. So I went back for another, more detailed diagnostic one. They found punctate, segmented calcifications in the left breast, which they called \"suspicious.\" They recommended surgical excision and surgical biopsy. I'm also wondering why they didn't take their original next step of an ultrasound--it was already ordered. I'm guessing once they saw the segmentation, they saw it as a red flag and went straight to the biopsy? I can't have a needle biopsy b/c my breasts are too small.....so it has to be surgical....but I'm wondering why they are recommended the excision--taking the whole area out--without knowing if it's benign or malignant. Is this common? I mean, once they are surgically in there, is it common to go ahead and remove all of the tissue? Or does this point to a more serious situation they are thinking? They gave me a BI-RAD category 4A. I'm really all for just taking it out, if that's what they want..... Once they are deemed suspicious, are even benign calcifications more likely to be something worse down the line? Any experience with this appreciated! Dee",

      "Content": "Actually I haven't done it yet....I couldn't sleep, so I just got up to wait. Thanks for the info. : ) Carla, I'm sorry your progonosis was 50/50. Did they say what type of cancer it usually is, should it come back malignant? And it could still very well be benign, too! I know 50/50 is scary......but the odds could have been worse, too, kwim? Take it one step at a time. I agree that knowledge is power. I want to know what I'm dealing with, might possibly be dealing with and what the plan is. The worst thing my surgeon said was it could come back in the middle. Not benign, but not 100 percent sure of malignancy. No thank you to that! I'll let you guys know how it goes today. For right now, I just wish I could have some coffee and a dounut! Dee",
