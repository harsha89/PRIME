      "Content": "Ginger Tea, Surgeon never mentioned radiation. She referred to my lump as \" entity\" that needs to be removed. What confuses me is that the radiology reports recommended excisional biopsy , but surgeon said I need lumpectomy. When I pointed that out, this is where she was evasive. Hugs to your sister.",

      "Content": "So after my discordant biopsy that showed only benign fibrocystic changes, surgeon sceduled me for a lumpectomy!!! I have never been more scared or confused, and she seemed to dodge all my questions about why I need a lumpectomy . So my question is to the people on this board- what is your lumpectomy experience was and why you need it also, is lumpectomy same as excisional biopsy. I read different things on the internet , and frankly it all doesnt make sense to me. Any feedback is appreciated",
