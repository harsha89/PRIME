    "Content": "I had a lump too. My sister had breast cancer so I was really scared. The mammogram I had didn't define what it was and the ultrasound wasn't helpful either. I went to a General Surgeon and had it aspirated in her office. The fluid was clear but with my family history she left it up to me whether I wanted to have it out or wait a few months to see what developed. She said unless it was taken out and really examined we would not know for sure. I opted for surgery and it turned out I had Fibrocystic disease - a benign condition. I was really relieved to know what it was and you will be too when you go to the doctor and find out it's probably nothing. 90% approx. of lumps are nothing to worry about but you have to be sure. I am taking 800 mg Vitamin E daily and have had no lump problems since. Good luck to you. Do go to a doctor and get it over with. You will feel a whole lot better.",
