    "Content": "I don't have breast cancer but I have Ovarian cancer. I didn't find that having chemo without a port was painful at all. Aside from having to get pricked each time. Just dealing with the different after side effects is the painful part. as for your port question, I would imagine that the discomfort and what not is normal. I had a port in my upper arm and found that I couldn't even sleep on one of my sides because it would pinch the line against my collar bone. Good luck",
