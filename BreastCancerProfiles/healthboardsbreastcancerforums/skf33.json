      "Content": "I had a cone august 25th and I'm still waiting for my period. It seems late, but, we'll see. I cant say much about the post pain from the cone during the period since I havent had mine yet. But, I do have sharp pains from that area sometimes...perhaps vascular changes due to a nearing cycle. As for the lumps, its always safe to check them out, but around your period they seem common and almost sometimes feel knotty or ropy.... I get them too. Good luck",
