    "Content": "Hello to all. I'm new to this forum,but I've been reading some of the stories and that is what gave me the courage to join. Kinda nervous now, but I'm hoping someone will enlighten , reassure me somewhat as to my situation. I am 45 years old and I've had mammos annually since 2008,all normal. Unfortunately, I couldn't have one last year because of lack of insurance, but thankfully I have some now. Here goes..... I've noticed a (what I think is a solid) lump in the lower outer quadrant of my left breast. Not movable, nor painful. Saw my doctor, referred for a mammo, which didn't show the lump. Referred to breast surgeon, referred got an ultrasound, which was abnormal. The results are as follows, \"there is a 9mm well circumscribed hypoechoic mass with mild posterior enhancement, internal echoes may represent a solid mass, less likely complicated cyst. Intraductal origin cannot be excluded. Few adjacent slightly dilated ducts are seen. Impression: category 4- suspicious left breast palpable mass, aspiration/biopsy recommended.\" my doctor is setting up a biopsy so I won't know anything until then. I'm tired of waiting. Can someone please tell me what this means or if anyone has had or has a similar situation? I would really appreciate it. Thanks.",
