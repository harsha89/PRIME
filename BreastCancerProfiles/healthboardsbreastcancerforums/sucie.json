    "Content": "Hi Krystella, I agree with Carreen. The ALH puts you at somewhat higher risk of future breast cancer, but it by no means says you will have it. What it does mean, however, is that you need regular followups....make sure you do a good breast self-exam every month, see your doctor at least yearly, and get a mammogram yearly. (I would not wait 2 years at age 52 on hormones with an abnormal-but-not-malignant biopsy.) I also personally would not want to take estrogen in your situation, but I'm also not familiar with clinical data that says it causes more problems in women with ALH. You'll have to talk to your breast surgeon about that one. And by the way, atypical lobular hyperplasia is very different from atypical ductal hyperplasia and the cancers that potentially develop from those cell types. DCIS is ductal carcinoma in situ, which is a stage 0 ductal carcinoma, not a lobular carcinoma. Lobular and ductal carcinomas behave very differently, but you don't need to worry about this because you don't have breast cancer, nor even a premalignant stage of breast cancer. (Always remember that when you're feeling scared.) Sucie",
