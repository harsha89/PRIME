    "Content": "Hello everyone. I had a mammogram on Monday and received a callback on Tuesday that something suspicious was seen on the left side. So, on Friday I'm going back to the radiologist's office for more tests. I'm scared b/c my mother had breast cancer at my age. I've been getting mammograms since I was 35 b/c of my family history and this is the first time that I've received a callback. I don't handle stress too well, as you can see. I know I shouldn't start worrying already, but I can't help it. Can someone give me any words of wisdom. Thanks in advance. Sue",
