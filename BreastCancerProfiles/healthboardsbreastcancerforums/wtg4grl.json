But from my understanding, if lymph nodes are not affected then theres a good chance for a long recovery. This is my opinion and not a medical doctor. Even though its rare it does not mean its not treatable. Bonnie Quote: Originally Posted by so_confuzzled Hey everyone, I really need help with something.

My aunt does not have the interenet so she does not have access to find out any information on this form of cancer The doctor told her she needs to get as much information as she can on this becaue He doesn't even know very much about it at all. I am so worried about her, one of her breasts were already removed, they did not find cancer in her lymphnodes. But they just checked her left breast and found a luimp this is how they came up with this Metoplastic carsenoma cancer. I was wondering if any of you ladies have had this cancer or do have it, or have known anyone that has had it before. Id really appreciate your help. I really want to help my aunt ou tand learn more about this. This is very rare like I said, there is no cure what so ever chemo will not help; this at all. Plz. Someone anyone i need advice. thankyou-chrystal",
