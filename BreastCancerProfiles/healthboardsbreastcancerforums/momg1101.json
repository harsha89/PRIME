    "Content": "I don't kow if this will help you any... But I am 32 and I had to go in yesterday because of a lump in my breast. The mamogram showed positive yet my ultrasound showed negative.( the ultrasound didn't even pick it up) I was told yesterday a lot of times they want a ultrasound on the younger patients because the breast is more dense and harder for the mamogram to pick up on any problems. Whereas the ultrasound can pick up on the dense tissue. The older you get the less dense the tissue is. As for me...I'm very glad I had the mamogram done since the ultrasound did nothing but cost $ for me.",
