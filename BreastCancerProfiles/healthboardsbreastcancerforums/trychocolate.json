    "Content": "Hopefully your dr explained fibrous-cystic breast disease to you to calm your worries. I don't know how old you are, but this condition can start when you are fairly young and I am 50, past menopause (it's supposed to be hormone related) and still have it. If your dr were suspicious, she probably would have ordered an ultra-sound of your breast. Apparently, cancer has very distinct characteristics and differs greatly from this condition. This condition does not make you more prone to cancer, but in sufficient quantities, can make mammograms unreliable, hence, the ultrasounds at regular intervals. Bear in mind, these cysts can grow to an unusually large size as well as be very small and in different shapes and thicknesses. This condition can sometimes be controlled by diet. Cysts can be asperated if they become numerous and troublesome. If you are unhappy with your dr, perhaps consider a second opinion. Hope this helps, choc",
