The Oxycontin doesn't make me drowsy or anything, I just take it three times a day and I'm ok. Pain caused by cancer is unlike any other pain I've had in my life! I was a Division I athlete in college and had 4 operations on my ankle, but it never hurt as bad as my bone mets do. Unless you've experienced it, there's no way to know what it's like. Vicodin and Percocet didn't cut it for me, but the Oxycontin does the job. Cancer pain is way out of the realm of Aleve and other OTCs.",

In my opinion, have the lumpectomy because a mass can be composed of several types of cells: invasive cancer, carcinoma in situ, and even benign tissue. If you opt for a core needle biopsy, what happens if the surgeon samples a part that is benign and you go home thinking there is no problem. When my tumors were biopsied they were composed of all three types of cells I listed above. I'm so glad that I had the lumpectomy b/c my surgeon was better able to treat me knowing what he was really dealing with. I hope your biopsies come back negative! I know it's scary, but remember, even if it does turn out to be cancer it doesn't mean you're getting a death sentence! I'm fine now, and so are millions of other women. I'll be thinking of you!",

The ultrasound showed they were both solid and had to be biopsied. When I had my second ultrasound, the smaller lump was not detected. Ater my biopsy I learned I had Stage II breast cancer and the smaller lump (the one that didn't show on the second ultrasound) was deadlier than the larger one! It's not great that your lump has grown, but that doesn't mean you have cancer. There are many things that lump could be and unfortunately cancer is one of the possibilities. I'm not trying to scare you, just trying to encourage you to take care of yourself. Get another ultrasound at a different hospital and compare the results. It's so important to ask the right questions and insist on getting answers. If one Dr sends you home saying \"You're too young to have breast cancer\" find another Dr that will listen to what you have to say, read your ultrasound and spend time on the diagnosis. It's really scary not knowing -- you'll get through it! Please make sure you get more tests done! -Kalie",

Malignant tumors grow and change. You will not necessarily have to have a biopsy. The first thing a Dr should do is order an ultrasound. The ultrasound can tell if the lump is fluid filled, meaning it's a cyst, or if it's a solid mass. If the ultrasound shows that it's a solid mass, the Dr may order a biopsy. I cannot stress enough how important it is to just get it checked -- it could save your life.

My cancer was caught at stage II (2 tumors in the left breast, no metastasis or lymph node involvement) which is early and very treatable. That was 2 yrs ago. Unfortunately, I've had a nasty recurrence and it has spread to my lung, liver and back. I just learned that a few wks ago. I am now stage IV and undergoing chemo, but I should be fine in a few months. The medical community is having a difficult time with breast cancer in women in the their 20s b/c the cancer behaves differently and has different characteristics from cancers in post-menopausal women. I was diagnosed at 25, I'm 27 now. I think the important thing that people should know about cancer is that it isn't a death sentence.

      "Content": "Hi there! I'm sorry to hear about your mom -- I hope she is doing well after her surgery. Life gets much easier once the Drs remove the drains. I'm a 26yo breast cancer survivor (stage II, e/p horomone receptor positive, aggressive). I was tested for both BRCA1 and 2, and my results were inconclusive. Researchers know that mutations in these genes may lead to breast cancer, but not all the mutations are mapped. Some mutations are deleterious (meaning they may lead to breast cancer), other mutations are not deleterious (meaning no potential problems), and some (lucky me), well they're just not sure what these mutations mean. Testing positive for mutations in BRCA1 or 2 does NOT mean you will develop breast cancer! What it does mean, (to me anyway) is that you have an opportunity to monitor yourself more closely and adjust your lifestyle to help prevent breast cancer (maintain a healthy weight, only drink 1 alchohol drink per day, exercise regularly, possibly take a drug like Tamoxifen to prevent the breast cancer from ever developing. Besides, only 10% of women diagnosed with breast cancer have a family history of the disease. My family has no cancer history at all, and I lost a breast to cancer at 26. I know how you feel right now, it's really nervwracking. The important thing to remember is that no matter how the results turn out, women today have a fabulous chance of beating cancer and preventing recurrences. There isn't a day that goes by that the thought of a recurrence doesn't cross my mind, but if I let myself obsess over it, I'll gain nothing, and lose the great days that I have. Good luck! I hope you test negative! Hang in there, Kalie (hug) [This message has been edited by Kalie (edited 10-24-2003).]",

      "Content": "Hello again yourspecialmiss, A biopsy is minor operation where the surgeon removes the lump (or part of it) and then sends a sample to the lab to see if the cells in the lump are actually cancerous. A lump can be many things from a cyst (fluid filled and non-cancerous) to fibrous (solid tissue, but still non-cancerous) to pre-cancer to cancer. One lump can also be composed of a combination of the above. Although I had 2 distinct tumors, I also had tiny bits of cancer throughout the breast so I had my one breast removed (mastectomy). I had a plastic surgeon perform reconstructive surgery and now even in a bikini you can't tell I had the breast removed! I am the only person in my family to have any kind of cancer. Just make sure that your Dr is thorough and finds out for sure one way or another what that lump is. Saying, \"it's probably nothing\" isn't good enough. Whenever I hear a Dr say \"probably\" I interrupt them actually Ask for an ultrasound. This test is very easy to perform and will tell you if the lump is fluid filled or solid which is a good place to start. If it is solid, I think you should have a biopsy b/c there isn't any other way to know for sure if the cells are cancerous. In my experience, it was best to have the lump removed entirely and have the whole thing biopsied b/c part of my lump was non-cancerous and part of it was deadly. What if the surgeon only sampled the part that was benign? I don't mean to frighten you, I just want you to make sure that you're ok! No one looks out for us better than ourselves. I have found that especially at our age, people are much more likely to say, \"it's probably nothing\". I hope I don't sound like I'm down on Drs either, b/c the Drs that I ended up with saved my life. Unfortunately, I had to see some not-so-great Drs before I found them.

When I had my lump removed I didn't even get general anaesthesia, I was awake for the 30 minute procedure.

The needle biopsy is even less invasive, but remember the results may not be as accurate due to sampling. If the surgeon removes the entire lump, he can have all those cells checked by the pathologist. If he takes samples with the needle, he could grab part of the lump that is benign, or pre-cancerous, and not realize that 1mm to the right are invasive cancer cells. When is your procedure?

I had no side effects from the Tamoxifen, but I think I'm having some lousy ones from the Viadur: hot flashes (which are pretty common), nausea and back pain. Has anyone else experienced back pain? I couldn't find this listed as a side effect anywhere. Does the nausea ever go away? Thanks!",

      "Content": "Hi fariegoddess, Hopefully this whole thing will turn out to be nothing. I would definitely recommend requesting an ultrasound. It is more difficult for a mgram to detect breast cancer in younger women b/c our breast tissue is denser. I found my lump by accident one day. It didn't hurt, it was kind of close to the surface so I could poke at it pretty easily. It was kind of mobile in that if I pushed it with my finger I could kind of move it around. It was irregularly shaped. I learned later that as cancer advances tumors become less and less mobile as they anchor themselves into surrounding tissue. I had some really great experiences with Drs, and I also had some experiences that made me question how these people graduated med school! My obgyn didn't want to send me for any tests at all. She said I was too young to have cancer. I wouldn't leave her office until she wrote me a script for an ultrasound. She isn't my obgyn anymore I also had a second tumor that one Dr missed. This Dr's ultrasound tech didn't pick it up, but another Dr's tech did. If your tests show that the lump is solid (not a cyst) you will probably need a biopsy, which really isn't too bad. If you need a biopsy (which I hope you don't btw) talk to your surgeon about performing a lumpectomy instead of a core needle biopsy. I wanted a core needle procedure which is less invasive, but my surgeon pointed out that if he used the needle to grab a sample, that sample is not necessarily indicative of the composition of the whole tumor. He was right -- my tumor was part DCIS (pre-cancer), part moderately aggressive cancer, and part very aggressive cancer cells. What if I continued treatment thinking I only had pre-cancer? I hope I'm not scaring you or getting ahead of the situation by talking about biopsies and stuff, it's just that you never know if people will revisit this board and I just really wanted to let you know about some potential problems that good Drs can help you avoid. I'll be thinking about you! If you think of anything else, post back! Also, pls post your results if you don't mind -- I hope everything turns out great! Kalie",

My fiance (husband now) and I were going to bed and when he hugged me goodnight, his thumb touched something hard on the outside of my left breast. Long story short...that happened in May, I couldn't get an appt with a Dr until the end of July b/c they all told me I was too young to have breast cancer and it was probably nothing. The Dr who I saw in July is absolutely fabulous -- I can't say enough about him. He took me very seriously from the start. He performed my lumpectomy, diagnosed my cancer, and told me I needed a mastectomy. Ah! What? At 25? That was the first time I actually cried. Naturally, my husband and I went for a second opinion. The second surgeon told me that even though my first ultrasound showed 2 masses, that the one she did after my lumpectomy didn't show the remaining lump. She actually started clapping! Then she recommended some radiation and sent us on our way. On the way to the car we decided to go back to the Dr who performed the lumpectomy. It's a good thing we did, b/c the second tumor was still inside my breast and was even more aggressive than the one that came out. Also, the MRI showed that residual cancer was throughout the breast and his first recommendation was the best one -- the breast had to go. So, my Dr performed a skin-conserving mastectomy with the aid of my plastic surgeon (who I also adore!). My fabulous husband was with me the whole time as I drooled in a morphine-induced sleep in recovery. I went through 3.5 months of tissue expansion to get the pectoralis and skin ready for the permanent implant and then I had surgery again and got my wonderful new silicone breast! Even in a bikini no one can tell I had a mastectomy -- without a bra or bikini top you can easily tell, but that's ok with me. I'm in full remission, coming up on the second anniversary of my diagnosis. I'm so thankful to my husband, my family and my Drs. Hehe, kind of makes me tear a bit thinking about all of them. I hope I didn't ramble too long! I hang around on this board b/c I know that there are other women out there who are unsure of what to do when they find a lump, or worse, who go to a medical professional and go home unsatisfied and scared. Thanks for listening!",

Here's the other problem, the surgeon needs to know where the mass is before operating -- if the diagnostic technologies can't find it, and the surgeon can't feel it, he isn't going to be digging around with a scalpel in the breast tissue. What about another ultrasound at a different hospital? I was diagnosed with breast cancer at 25 (I'm 27 now), never had a mammogram, and the ultrasound tech found both my tumors. On my second ulatrasound, a different tech missed one of the tumors and said I only had one. My point is that people are fallible. The good news is that you said the lump hasn't changed. Cancer changes: it grows, the mass changes shape, it begins to adhere more firmly to the breast tissue so it isn't as movable, etc. I don't blame you for wanting it checked out. Get a prescription for an ultrasound from another Dr.",

I had Dr's turn me away, refuse to do tests, etc. DEMAND an ultrasound. If your current Dr won't write the script for it, go see another one. If the ultrasound shows that the mass isn't fluid filled you should have another biopsy. As far as biopsies go, this is what I learned through my experience with cancer; a lump can be comprised of several different types of cells. Part of the lump may be benign, part precancer (DCIS), and part may be invasive cancer. Because of this, core needle biopsies, although less invasive, are less accurate. The needle may have sampled a part of the tumor that is benign while a mm to the right there are invasive cancer cells. Because of this potential issue my surgeon performed a lumpectomy and had my entire lump biopsied. Guess what? Mixture of DCIS and invasion! It's possible that I could have undergone less aggressive (and less effective) treatment b/c of flawed biopsy results with a core needle. Just because this is my experience doesn't mean you have cancer -- I hope I don't sound like the angle of death or anything! I just can't stress enough that we really need to look out for ourselves as patients. I think that young women have to be even more diligent due to Drs' tendencies to turn us away b/c we're \"too young to have breast cancer\". Although it's more unlikely, it's not impossible. Pursue it! Don't let anyone tell you everything is ok without proving it first. You'll feel so much better when you know for sure that you're ok!",
