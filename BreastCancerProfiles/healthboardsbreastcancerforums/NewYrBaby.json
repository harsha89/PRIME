    "Content": "YES!.......... I do dark green (L) nipple discharge. I went to see my GYN today and he took a slide sample. I am absolutely scared to death.... I am literally shaking all over. I have to wait until after Easter for my Mammo and Ultrasound. Waiting is so hard. I have had discharge since my son was born 8 years ago, but now it's only in the left nipple and is now a very dark green color. GYN said he feels it's fibrocystic changes. But in only one breast? I'm confused. Last year my Mammo was (-) but my ultrasound was positive for a lump. I had it removed, and thankfully it was a fibro adenoma. Signed, Wendy (just scared)",
