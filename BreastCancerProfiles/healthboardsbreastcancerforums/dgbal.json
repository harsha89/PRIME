    "Content": "I had a routine mammogram yesterday and they found 7 areas of white speckles or calcifications as they called it. I was there from 1:30 to 4:00 for almost constant test. Then after finding the speckles, they did a magnification of the speckles and then a ultrasound. Finally they sent me in to talk to a women doctor and she said she wanted me to come back in 4 months to mammogram the right breast again. I do have a cyst in the right breast that I had aspirated 2 years ago, so she wants to aspirate it next week. She also said something was attached behind it. She said she didn't think it was anything malignant because something about things were smooth. It seems to me if her what she sees, she is unsure of, that they would just go ahead and do a needle biopsy. I wouldn't want to wait 4 months if I have a malignancy of sorts. I would appreciate any imput or opinions on this. My gyno has not seen the reports yet, so would she make the final decision of what to do or the lady at the hospital? THANK YOU!",
