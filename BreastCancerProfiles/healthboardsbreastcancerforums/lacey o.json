    "Content": "Hi, I went today for my ultrasound casue one doc. found lump week ago, well they sent me to the wrong doctor today, so I did not get one, well the ob felt today and said they did not feel a lump, just some fibercystic stuff, but now I have to wait for an ultrasound, Sept. 10. Well, they are acting like it was nothing big, no prob. My mom is a nurse practioner ,and I had her feel and she said she felt nothing hard and that it moved around. So, she and everyone else is trying to tell me its not cancer. But my lymph nodes have knots and tender, and I still have milk coming out of my left breast, the one that one doctor told me had a vague lump, but she said it kept moving. So, one health dept. doc told me she felt a vague lump, and the others today said they did not feel anything except fibercystic. So, what do think,I'm stressing so much, I do ache in my breast and it is sagging so much. What do you guys think, PLEASE HELP!!!!",
