    "Content": "Someone I'm really close to is going through the same thing. She had a reoccurance of breast cancer and it spread to her lungs. She went through over 6 chemotherapy treatments that got rid of the cancer in her lungs but it spread to her nearby [lung] lymph nodes. Does anyone know what stage this would be considered? And what to expect. She is getting new treatments as well. I'm just really worried. Thanks.",
