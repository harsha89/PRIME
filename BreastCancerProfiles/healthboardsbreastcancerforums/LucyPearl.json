      "Content": "Allic...thank you so very much for your encouragement. There really is solace and strength found in prayer. I have been remembering on scripture in particular...\"God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power, love and a sound mind!\" I'm seriously trying to hold on to that \"sound mind\" part! By the way...still haven't heard anything back from doctor's office yet...I'm guessing by now they've had a chance to compare my last year's mammo to this one....so now I just wait...and pray. Thanks so much again and God bless you while you wait for surgery. Lucy",

      "Content": "Hi. I'm 48 years old and have had my annual mammos yearly since I turned 40.They have all come back negative. There was a time about 6 years ago when my gyn thought he felt something in my left breast and immediately scheduled me for a diag mammo w/ultrasound. Thank God it turned out to be nothing. My last mammo was January 07 w/negative results. I have recently relocated to a different city about 3 months ago. Almost immediately I noticed a dull pain underneath my left armpit (maybe about a week or so after moving). Prior to then, nothing at all. I started checking my armpit...did not feel any lumps. Checked my breasts and not lumps either. It went away for a while and now has returned. I just had my annual mammo done last week. I don't know if my mind is playing tricks on me or not. Now I feel what I think is a soft lump (movable) under that same armpit and my breast hurts off and on...sometimes my right breast and armpit too but mostly in my left. My left breast also looks to be a little bit bigger now than my right...I don't know, maybe it was always that way and I'm just looking for anything I told the breast tech this. I got a call this a.m. that they want to see copies of my previous mammo. They requested that last week and I signed a release. They called again today (apparently they lost the contact number) So now I'm just waiting. Obviously the radiologist must have seen something on my mammo that she/he is questioning and wants to compare it. Im so scared right now...so very scared. Both of my breasts have been feeling \"full\" lately. I do drink coffee and have been on a big chocolate binge in past 3 months since my move...guess it's stress...I just don't know. Can anyone out there offer any advice or input? Thank you so much.",

      "Content": "Tmarie... Thank you so much for your response and encouragement! I just feel so helpless...just don't know what to do except pray. That's really enough and it certainly is better than worrying (just wish I could hit the off button on that!) Anyway, thanks so much again and I will keep you posted as soon as I know something...the waiting is tough...but I'm sure everyone here already knows that...thanks again. Lucy",
