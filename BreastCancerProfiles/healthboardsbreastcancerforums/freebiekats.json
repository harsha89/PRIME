      "Content": "I had a cone biopsy about 3 weeks ago and 2 days ago I started my first period since the operation. After the biopsy I had severe pain for over a week, the doctor even said that I was much more sensitive than she had expected. But with the start of this period were the most intense cramps I have ever had, maybe even more painful than the aftermath of the surgery itself. Plus the bleeding is heavy heavy heavy and really dark and clotty. At first I had to change pads every hour, but now it has slacked off, although the pain has not. I wont be able to see the doctor until Tuesday so I am trying to get some input while I wait. The pain is keeping me from sleeping. I havent slept in over 24 hours. Also, about a week ago I found a sore spot in my left breast. It is movable and about the size of a bottle cap. I have had a sore spot in my breast before that was only a bruise, but I havent done anything to bruise it this time. I have been under a lot of stress because of this operation and other regular life circumstances and thought this might just be a physical reaction. I am only 23 and have been told I am too young for any sort of breast cancer, though my grandmother had to have both of her breasts removed. I thought maybe the two were related and it could be from my extreme sensitivity causing an increase in soreness, etc, but then why the lump? Has anybody else had these problems? I know this post may be hard to understand, like I said, I havent slept in ages and my mind just isnt functioning properly... Please Help!!!",

      "Content": "Hello I am having my first period after a cone biopsy 3 weeks ago and the cramps are near unbearable, going on 3 days now and hurt worse than when I had the surgery in the first place. After the operation the doctor said I was way more sensitive than most people, so I was wondering if this intensity of pain is not uncommon. I have to change my pad every 2 hours at the very least. Also, on another note, is it possible to have a lump in your breast that is very sore and slightly moveable? I am only 23 and have been told I am too young for breast cancer, though the disease runs in my family. Somebody please help me, I have nowhere else to turn until I go back to the doctor. Thanks in advance to anyone who has anything to shed light on the subject!!! emily",
