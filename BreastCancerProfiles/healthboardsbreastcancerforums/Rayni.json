      "Content": "I would definitely go for the mammogram & ultrasound. I found a lump in approximately the same place that couldn't be felt standing up, but could laying down. I went for the diagnostic mammogram, which sounds like your doctor is referring you for. Not to scare you, because it could be benign, but mine was malignant. I had another one that was mushy, but looked cancerous on the film. It was benign.",

      "Content": "You've prolly already made your decision, but I just joined today. I've been searching for help. I just recently had brachytherapy radiation to the whole breast. It was twice a day for 5 days, I live a ways from the center that does brachytherapy which is why I had it done in condensed amount of time. Studies have been done that show a large amount of women have a recurrence of a malignant lump if radiation is not done. Brachytherapy does not involve the old-fashioned radiation that causes problems w/ribs, lung or heart. I was able to hold my niece's baby too.",
