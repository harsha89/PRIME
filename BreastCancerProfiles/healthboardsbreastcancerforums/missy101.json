    "Content": "I am 33 yrs old. I am a mother of one daughter who is 3. I started my period in the 5th grade. I have been having some concerning symptoms in the recent past which have prompted me to have some tests taken. I will list them in a moment. I have developed a new issue which worries me. In the past 3 days I have been experiencing breast pain. Only in my left breast. It is a dull, shooting pain that comes and goes. Worse if I am up and walking around. Also, the area (this has been true for some time) on the side of my breast - under my arm, but down more - not in the arm pit - is very sore to the touch. I feel no lumps or anything strange at all. I am a 38D so it is kinda hard to do self exams - at least for me for whatever reason. But I feel nothing in the way of lumps or masses at all. My nipples are not anymore sensitve or painful. So here are the test I have taken (I am curious if any of these would have indicated Breast Cancer) and I have been told they are normal... Progesterone Estrogen Prolactin Yesterday I had a full thyroid panel (TSH, Free T4 and T3, Cortisol and Insulin Levels and Fasting Glucose)...do not have these results yet. Since the sex hormones are considered normal levels - should I not worry about breast cancer? Would abnormalities show in those tests? One more thing...I have no family history of breast cancer. But my grandmother did die at age 58 of ovarian cancer. Below I will list my symptoms to give a better picture: List of long term symptoms: Hx of Anxiety, SVT, Depression, Irritability, PVCs and PACs and Fatigue (Anxiety, Tachycardia and Palpitations controlled with Klonopin and Metoprolol) Allergies \u0096 seasonal Highly sensitive in general \u0096 to EVERYTHING (mosquito bite gets huge and red \u0096 everything seems exaggerated) Symptoms since having child (3 years ago): Heavy periods with clotting Irregularity in periods Breast tenderness Major bloating in abdomen and chest prior to period Lightheadedness Low BP Mood Swings Brain Fog Very low energy levels Increasingly severe fatigue Insomnia (recent) Hot Flashes (recent) Increased Irritability Increase in headaches \u0096 sinus type Thank you so much for listening. I know I probably shouldnt waste space here and leave it for those who actually have been diagnosed. But I am just worried.
