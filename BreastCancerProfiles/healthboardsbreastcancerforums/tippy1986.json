    "Content": "My 26yr old daughter is also having a rough time with possible symptoms of breast cancer. Since there is a significant link to breast cancer( from mother) I would recommend a visit to your OBGYN. If you don't have one, go online to your health care provider( Insurance Carrier) & verify a OBGYN in your area. Once you schedule an appointment, make a list of all your concerns and family history. Remain positive and keep a log of each new change/symptom. Also, it was recommended to my daughter that she keep a photo log of each visible change. Make plenty of notes at each doctor appointment and home as well. I wish you well!",
