      "Content": "I have a friend. She is 15 years old, and she claims to have breast cancer. Being her friend, I have every reason to believe what she tells me, but there are some things that don\u0092t seem to add up. Here\u0092s a list of the reasons that make me doubtful. *When she was diagnosed, she didn\u0092t have her parents with her, and didn\u0092t want to even tell them about it. She also requested that her friends didn\u0092t talk about or even mention her cancer. *Her parents are leaving her to go to out of town for a week, and want her to find somewhere else to stay, out of the comfort of her own home. *Her oral chemotherapy pills resemble perfectly to Vitamin E pills. She keeps them in a small tin (not the bottle), and freely handles them. *After breaking the news to her friends. She waited almost one month to start chemotherapy treatments. *Because she is so young, I feel doctors would be more inclined to operate. *The day after her first chemo treatment, she looked not only healthy and strong, but had loads of energy and told everyone she felt great. *Before receiving her first chemo treatment, she discussed how scared she was, which is understandable, however, she was seriously considering not going through with it because some of her closest friends were going to be out of town and unable to be there for her. Her next treatment is scheduled for when again her friends will be out of town. *Because her mom was going to be out of town, she had first planned on driving herself (yes, illegally) to and from chemo. *She still works many hours every weekend in her very physically demanding job. *She recently started going to a tanning bed, which I think only adds to the stress of cancer. *She has claimed that her type of chemotherapy will NOT result in hair loss, it would only leave a rash hidden on her breasts. *She says that her cancer hurts, but according to other people\u0092s knowledge of breast cancer, her tumor shouldn\u0092t hurt. *She has told everyone that because her tumor is pressing against her heart, she only has a little over a year life expectancy. Wouldn\u0092t doctors want to operate immediately to remove the tumor? I would greatly appreciate any advice or comments about what I have observed in the last few months. I hate having a sense of doubt in my mind. Please tell me if the above is all normal, or do I need to take more direct measures on clearing it all up. Thank you.",

      "Content": "Thank you everyone for replying to my post. My friend's story has become even more detailed. When I asked her what chemo drugs she was taking and what stage she was in, she proceeded in telling me that she couldn't remember the name of the drug, but it started with an \"S\" and she was in the \"early stage', but she couldn't remember the name to that either. This new information upset me because I knew she was and still is lying to me. Somehow this breast cancer has spread to her lung! Her doctor doesn't know how that happened and now she is going to get a second opinion from another doctor. Since her first treatment over a month ago, she hasnt mentioned anything else about having another chemotherapy session. Thank you for support again, and feel free to post if you have any more ideas. I do believe she's lying, but time will eventually tell.",
