      "Content": "About a month ago I discovered that I had a slight pain when I was doing my self exam above my right nipple. The pain is only there when I press on it, if not touched I wouldn\u0092t have even discovered it. I thought it was weird that I had it two weeks before my period, so I booked a doc appointment. He sent me to get an ultrasound and the results came back showing a couple of cysts and a lymph node. He said the pain should go away after my next period, I told him that it hasn\u0092t gone away from my previous one a couple weeks ago, so he is sending me for another ultrasound once I finish my next one.. he said the next step would be a mammogram. I left feeling very uneasy because he didn\u0092t tell me anything.... I was hoping it was related to a cyst.. but he made no mention of that.",

      "Content": "thanks for your message! I am going for an ultrasound after my next period ends (send in a week and a bit), I also am trying not to touch the spot on my breast because since I discovered it.. it haven\u0092t stopped touching it. I\u0092m hoping this goes away on its own and that it really is related to my menstral cycle. I am hoping it\u0092s just a cysts, but my doctor didn\u0092t say it was.. so that\u0092s why I was kind of left feeling uneasy about it... but, maybe he is just being sure. I\u0092ll sefinitely keep you all updated.. thanks!",
