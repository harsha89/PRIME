    "Content": "Hi there, I went through surgical menopause 15yrs ago, taking my uterus and ovaries. In 2009 after having a few months of pain in my breast, I was diagnosed with fibroids. From all of the literature I have gathered, breast fibroids diminish after menopause and are usually caused from hormonal changes from estrogen and progesterone. To this date, I have not found out the cause of my fibroids (being 12 yrs after menopause) Dr.'s or otherwise and they are becoming more painful. My mammograms were decreased to annually in 2011. Anyone have a take on this or more expertise information? Thank you",
