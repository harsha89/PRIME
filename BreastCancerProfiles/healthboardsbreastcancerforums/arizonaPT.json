    "Content": "Hello- What your friend is describing is all too common - scar tissue, or adhesions, can form after surgery or radiation. Your friend should find a physical therapist who has experience working with cancer patients, and one with good \"manual skills\" ie who can work well with his/her hands to soften the tight tissue and teach exercises to decrease pain and range of motion limiations. There are people available who are trained to help! Don't give up!",
