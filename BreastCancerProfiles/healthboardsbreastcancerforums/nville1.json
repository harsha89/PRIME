    "Content": "Howdy I was 35 ('bout 10 years ago) when I had my first screening mammogram. I was told all was \"normal\", but they wanted me to have it repeated in 6 months, that there was just \"something\" they wanted to look at later. No lump or anything palpable. No family history of breast Ca. Well, I wanted to see a copy of the report, and they got all squirrely about letting me see it. They had me come in and the doctor at first \"explained\" it to me. It seems there were microcalcifications, he told me it was nothing to worry about, that i was young, etc. I still wanted to READ THE REPORT. So he let me, and I almost fainted, the wording was bad, it said I had suspicious cluster of microcalcifications, and they could not \"rule out malignancy\". I demanded a referral to a breast surgeon. I was given an appt to pacify me. The breast surgeon also told me that they just have to word the report that way to cover their [emailÂ protected]@'s, nothing to worry about. However, I am the worlds worst hypochondriac, and I said, it is my body, and I want a biopsy. So a biopsy was done, and I was diagnosed with microinvasive ductal Ca, just beginning to invade outside the ducts. I wanted it out, I wanted it all out, so I had a mastectomy and got the fantastic news that all nodes were negative! No chemo, no nothing. 2 years later, I had the other breast off after new clusters of microcalcifications started appearing. I just wanted it all to be over, no more worrying about it. I had great reconstructive work done, there are people who have changed with me in the locker room and they don't even know I have had double mastectomies. 10 years later, I am glad I did what I did, that I stood up for myself and insisted on a biopsy. If I was wrong and it was nothing, hey, its just a little scar. But if it WAS cancer and I did nothing, I would have had positive nodes and a very different outcome. That's my story. I was terrified at first, but now I just feel courageous and free.",
