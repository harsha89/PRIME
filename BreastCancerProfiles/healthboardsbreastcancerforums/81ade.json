    "Content": "I'm 51, with small, densly fibrocystic breasts with no family history of breast cancer. A recent mammogram revealed microcalcifications and it was suggested I have a needle biopsy, which I did. I did not expect it to be a big deal, since I'm usually quite strong and positive about such things. But the procedure was more intense than I had expected. Although I was stoic throughout, the minute I was alone in recovery, I broke down in tears. I suppose this was from the emotional stress and invasiveness of something I'd never experienced. I was not overly concerned about the results, since my two sisters had gone through the same thing and ended up only with benign cysts. One sister even had multiple biopsies and then was advised to just stop there because they most likely would all be benign. Of course, the foreign language of the pathologist's report was confusing, but as my husband and I researched it, we didn't really find much to be concerned about. However, a breast specialist recommended a full, golf-ball sized biopsy (I don't think I even have that much tissue in there!) So, here's the language; if anyone can tell me about any of it, I'd be appreciative: \"The biopsies show few areas of fibrocystic change with focal florid ductal epithelieal hyperplasia mixed with calcifications. A subtle intraductal papilloma is also identified. There is no evidence of maignancy.\"",
