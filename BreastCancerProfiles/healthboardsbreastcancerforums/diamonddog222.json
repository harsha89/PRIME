    "Content": "I am a male, and my fiance has had a mammogram recently. It showed a change in shape from a recent 1, so a needle biopsy is scheduled for next week. The last couple of days she has had much more pain, which concerns me. A female friend of mine said her doctor told her that having pain was usually a good sign, at least regarding whether the mass is malignant or not the lump is benign or malignant. Her doctor told her that benign lumps are generally painful and malignant lumps are not usually very painful. Can anyone offer any personal opinion based on ur own experience? We are both very concerned about this, and I guess I'm just looking for any possible good news before the biopsy.",
