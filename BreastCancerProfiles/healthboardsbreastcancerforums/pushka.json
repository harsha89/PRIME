    "Content": "Hi there The CA125 is best used when someone has already been diagnosed with OVca and it is used to track treatment success. The CA125 can be raised in non malignant conditions (endo, periods, etc) and it can be low in cancer cases, espcecially early on, so on its own it is very non specific. A vaginal ultrasound is your best tool - and if a cyst shows up unless it is clearly cancer (ascites, septations etc etc) it should be repeated in 6 weeks time as most cysts are functional and go away. If it is still there on the next ultrasound, have it removed despite what your Drs say. I had a persistent complex cyst over 3 months and all the specialists said it was only an endometrioma. I insisted on having the ovary removed because I am concerned about ovarian cancer and I have a number of the risks (no children, fertility treatment etc etc) Well, when they did the pathology, they were all WRONG! I had a tumour - borderline cancer, and had a hysterectomy. My CA125 was 15 - 30 is regarded as 'below suspicion' here. I have read of ladies with very malignant cancer and having a CA125 of 7! I have read of women with endo with a CA125 in the 1000's. So you can see the problem with it. So if a cyst persists and you are concerned, follow your own instinct.",
