    "Content": "I had microcalcifications many years ago. Presented them to a surgeon. He told me to leave them alone as they didn't look like the ones that would suggest malignancy. There are some doctors who would say to operate ASAP. A few years later, on my other breast I had some calcifications analyzed. I had a stereotactic biopsy which WAS NOT bad. It turned out the calcifications were benign and since then I've relaxed a lot. So do what your heart tells you to do.",
