      "Content": "Since January I have intermittent sharp pains through my left breast, usually right below my nipple or on the right side. I did a self breast exam, and found a weird shaped lump, feels like a small bean. I'm 29 years old, and my family has a history of breast cancer on my mothers side. Im feeling like this is probably nothing as my breasts are pretty lumpy, although have never experienced pain. I am going to see my family Dr, but dont really want to waste his time as Im sure its probably nothing. Im really only going at my moms persistance. Has anyone experienced these symptoms and it was nothing?",

      "Content": "Sorry if this isnt the right place to post this, Im just looking for some insight from women who may have had these similar symptoms. For the past few weeks I have a sharp pain in my upper & right side of my left breast, it comes and goes but when it comes it is extremely painful. Tonight after the pain left I felt my breast for any lumps and did find a small, hard lump about the size of a large pea. My family has a history of breast cancer, so I am a tad worried although Ive read if there is pain it probably isnt to serious.... Any insight at all?",
