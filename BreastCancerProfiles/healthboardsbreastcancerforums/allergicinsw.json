    "Content": "Hi God I know what you are going through. I had another ultrasound last week after one in Oct said I had a simple cyst 2.2 cm. I also had a CT and nothing was seen and a neg CA-125. I also had a neg CA-125 this week. My ultrasound (both vag and exterior) showed a 1.9 cm cyst with some internal echoes. My doc said this is common and is probably blood but I am freaked. I told him I want the look see at this pint. I have had over a year of symptoms. They are on and off but I am still a bit scared. I would rather know now. I have low back pain specifically right SI joint and this has been on and off for many years but seems to be worse. My stress incontinence which has been around since kids is worse and bloating, gas, constipation, and diarrhea have been arounfd for quite some time. Sometimes I feel ok and others not. They are doing a D&C plus hysteroscopy of uterus along withlaporatomy 2 June and I am scared but want to know for sure. What I do know is don't web search or you will go crazy. My doc thinks I am ok but is really doing this for me. I am doing this to just know but am scared to death. Hope all turns out ok for you. I have been told that if symptoms persist, the only sure thing is an internal look. I have had cysts before, 1 cm in 2001 but I guess I am a bit of a hypochondriac here. Sharon",
