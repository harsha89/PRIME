      "Content": "I just have my first mammogram and it came back with a nodule on the left breast. I've always been told I have lumpy breasts, so I'm not surprised, but they want to do another x-ray and possibly an ultrasound. Should I be more concerned than I am? Also, what does the other x-ray involve? Is it like the mammogram or something else? Oh, breast cancer does not run in my family.",
