    "Content": "I'm a 43 year old who's had a complete hysterectomy 14 years ago, had an oophorectomy 2 years ago, had POP surgery to repair my bladder prolapse, rectocele, thinner perineal body and had my vagina \"rebuilt\" last year. I thought, \"Hey, my lady parts can't bother me anymore, right?\" WRONG!!! About 10 days ago, I had a red streak running down my left breast, circling my nipple. Lots of pain, lots of swelling just out of the blue. (This was about 6pm.) By 8 am the next morning, I was in so much pain, running a fever and having chills, flu like symptoms, etc. and had to go to the ER. Was diagnosed with cellulitis and a deep breast abscess. Came back as a more rare form of staph than the \"normal\" one for a breast abscess. So, I've got a SUPER rare infection with a SUPER rare strain of bacteria. There was no scratch, bug bite, cut, etc. where the infection could of gained entrance to my deep breast tissue. No one can tell me how/why I got this infection when I haven't breast fed for 14 years. I don't have DM, AIDS or any other \"risk factor\" for a breast infection. I'm super clean/hygienic, etc. The antibiotics have seemed to clear up the cellulitis symptoms, but the deep abscesses (now there are three, not just one.) are worse, bigger. They drained the abscess in the ER and it came back bigger within 4 days, even on IV antibiotics and oral antibiotics. Now, after looking into this online (I know, I know, you should NEVER do that. . . .) I've noticed that, under my circumstances, IBC is a real possibility. Does anyone have any insight into this?",
