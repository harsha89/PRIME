    "Content": "I am a 55 year old married mother of 2 teenagers, and was diagnosed with re-current breast cancer (2 types) in Jan 2011 that resulted in mastectomy followed with chemo from April - June 2011 & Herceptin which continued to Feb 3, 2012. (1st BC diagnosis was at age 44 in Nov 2001 with radiation & lumpectomy). I have severe osteoporosis in the lower spine, and have had some early osteoarthritis for quite a few years. My question is...I have constant bone pain and joint stiffness...worse than it ever was. Plus within the past 6 months, I have been experiencing dental problems...and very sensitive teeth. I had always prided myself with good, strong teeth. Now they hurt when I drink cold water, eat cold fruit, chew or crunch harder more tougher foods, and my jaws feel as though I have a toothache now and again. How common are these symptoms with post chemo patients, and please, please....any suggestions on how to ease the pain, Or can some of these problems be from the Arimidex, and how long can I expect to experience them? Any food or additional supplements I can take to help alleviate some of the discomfort? I am missing out on doing things with my kids and working with my flower gardens...because of the pain and stiffness.",
