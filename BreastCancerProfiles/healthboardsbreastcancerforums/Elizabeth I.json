      "Content": "I can't tell you how much I appreciate your concern and caring...it means so much to me. With me, I found out today that they saw some small calcium deposits on my left breast, so they need to do additional studies and maybe a sonogram - which I've had before, just to make certain all is normal. They still said it's not an emergency, but I put a call into my doctor to make certain I have all the correct info. Again, you are the best! But I am still totally stressed. Thank you for all your empathy. If it were potentially a cyst, which I had 3 years ago, found in mammogram, totally benign, I would be less concerned. Best, Liz",

You're the best & thank you again for your sincere caring and concern. Best, Liz",

      "Content": "Dear Slenderella, Now I'm even more worried, because I received my letter and it says my mammogram showed a \"finding\" that requires supplementary imaging studies, such as additional mammorgraphic views or an ultrasound. And said if I had not already scheduled an appointment for these additional tests please do. It also says that these studies are separate from my annual screening mammorgram. Now I'm so scared. I don't know if I can sleep.",

I just had my yearly digital mammogram last Thursday and received a call that I had to come back for some more images on my left breast because the mammogram was \"inconclusive.\" They said not to worry and it was not an emergency and I could come back anytime, but I scheduled my new appointment for next Friday, which was their first open appointment. I'm trying not to be worried but I'm terrified. Should I be? Please help. Thanks so much.",

      "Content": "Dear Sue - Great news! I had the followup ***** today and the doctor told me that I have some normal and benign calcifications and everything looks excellent. I suggested when they call a patient back in for more studies, they either call the patient or have the primary call provider call the patient to let them know the actual situation. Thank you for all of your caring and concern, Sue, you don't know how much I appreciate it. Warm Regards, Liz:",
