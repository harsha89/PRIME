    "Content": "I was exercising and noticed a small lump (about the size of a large pea) under my left armpit. It doesn't hurt to press on it, but I can't tell if it is moveable. I did have some itching under my armpit a few weeks ago. I didn't think anything of it. A friend in the medical profession told me to watch it for 30 days (changes in size, pain,...). I am concerned and wonder if I should wait that long. What would be the first step to determine if this is cancer or just a benign cyst?",
