      "Content": "Update: I went back last week. This second mammogram was different, it compressed the breast areas harder. They sent me back to the waiting area....1/2 hr later I heard someone calling my name. Then they told me I needed an ultrasound....that's when I got terrified. Once the ultrasound was done, I got to talk to the radiologist, a very pleasant lady. She said \"she only sees good tissue through the ultrasound, but she wants to be sure that what she's seeing in the breast X-rays is nothing serious. She showed me the images. (She suspects it's just dense tissue.) So an MRI is ordered. Just waiting for the insurance authorization. I'll keep you posted. -- I.H.O.",

      "Content": "I've been doing my mammogram exam every year for the last seven years since I turned 40 -- for the last two years with the advanced technology of digital, and it has always been normal. This month I just had it done and a day later I was called to come in to have another one done next week. (Only for the Left side). I was told that this is not uncommon to have ait redone (also 17 other people are being called to come back for similar reasons). I was also told that there is a lot of \"dense tissue\" in my left breast, and, that the radiologist just want to be sure that it's all being seen properly. I'm just nervous because this never happened to me before, and, for the first time I'm being examined again. I often do my self-examination. There has not been any palpation of lumps, or discharge, or changes in the niples or dimples on the skin of the breast or an oversize dropping of the breast. Under these circumstances, how worried should I be about being called back in? Any reply would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.",
