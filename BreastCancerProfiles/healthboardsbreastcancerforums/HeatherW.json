      "Content": "jC, You do have to meet certian criteria for some of the tests but in many cases that is just that you have a certain type of cancer and that you are not a reoccurance. I would ask many doctors are activly involved in them but some are not. I did find that these tumors can release hormones. That may be the cause of your moodiness. In many cases the cells out of control and that have become cancerous are just mutations of normal cells. Your ovaries produce several hormones. Heather w.",

      "Content": "jc, I know that you are scared. My aunt was diagnosed with ovarian cancer stage III-C in 2001. She had surgery on Christmas eve. It is improtant to be as aggressive as possible with this if it is what is happening. The tumors do grow very fast but that one has probobly been there for a while. They cannot be seen or felt in many cases except with the Ct or a vaginal ultrasound. Pap smears DO NOT pick them up. That is why it is called the silent killer. All of the symptoms can be explained with somthing else. My aunts oncologist is wonderful and there is a very supportive staff. I trust yours will be the same. If not get a new doctor. He sounds good though. He has already scheduled the surgery. The mass can be identified with the CT scan somwhat. I can tell you that they probobly already know that it is not a cyst (fluid filled) and that if it is solid then that is not a good sign. Your doctors office should be getting some things together for you and they should have a good basic definitions of some of the words you are going to hear. You should volenteer for any chemo drug studies as they are going to give you the best chance at beating this. My aunt had what is called the triple dose of meds and I truley think that is whay she is still here. When there is a diagnosis of ovarian cancer there it is the most aggressive of cancers. It may come back when you think it is gone. You will only be able to take one drug in the second round of chemo. YOU MUST hit it with everything now. It is going to be really rough for a couple of days and your not going to know what is happening. Lean on your family. They love you. NOW all of that said I have scared the crap out of you but I know that your already scared. I pray the phone rings and they tell you it was all a mistake. I will pray for you in these next trying days. Various cancer societies will have some online sights that can explain some things that you may not understand. Be strong and do not push those that love you away. Heather",
