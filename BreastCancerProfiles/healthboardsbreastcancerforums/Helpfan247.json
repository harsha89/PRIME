    "Content": "My mom had a lump in her breast. She had to get surgery and they found a few more. When the test came back she had breast cancer it felt as though i died. The dr. gave 3 choses: 1 do nothing 2 surgery 3 pills she picked surgery. 1st they took out all of the tissue . . . (dec jan) she was in so much pain and i was so scared. She just got her last one and her breasts are hard and have no feeling, BUT is completely cured because they caught it so fast. So you should get it looked at because it may not hurt now but it hurt my mom after awile. Good Luck",
