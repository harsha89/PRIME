    "Content": "I had a lumpectomy in March and a month long series of radiation every day. The lumpectomy went fine and there was no lymph node involvememnt. I had it on FCriday and was at work Monday morning. There is nothing to it. The radiation was more of an inconvenience than anything as I had to travel quite far but I left work and went to my treatments at the end of the day. The only caution I would give yoou is to be sure to follow their instructions for skin care. It was a breeze. Best of luck and I am sure you will fly through it.",
