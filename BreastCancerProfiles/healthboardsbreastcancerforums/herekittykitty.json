      "Content": "Hi Lintek, Thank you for your response. You definately have a family history don't you? I'm sure you are very diligent with check-ups because of this. I am 43 and do still have cycles. This area that the doctor tried to aspirate has been there for five years and does go up and down in size. The day I went, it was smaller in size (ping pong ball size) but definately palpable. If it was small I would think that he just missed it, but if he missed something that size I don't think I want him operating on me, LOL! If the fluid went away in the cyst, the lump would just go away, right? I guess there is no reason to drive myself crazy guessing what happened. I will go for the new ultrasound Friday and see what it shows. I have a follow-up with the surgeon the Thursday after that.",

      "Content": "I have some breast cysts that I have had for about five years. I have had numerous mammograms and ultrasounds throughout this five years for these cysts and other things breast related. These cysts are in the same area and have grown quite large, sometimes getting to the size of an egg, and then shrinking back down to the size of a pingpong ball. I have never been concerned with these cysts because they have been proven as cysts and not solid via ultrasound. So, I went to a surgeon today about another breast lump to get a second opinion on a biopsy and he felt this grouping of cysts and said he wanted to do a fine needle aspiration. I had never had that before on these cysts. Well, to my surprise and his, no fluid was present! He didn't get a drop of anything and tried several times. I have seen these cysts myself on the ultrasound screen and I have all the reports from the ultrasounds and mammograms and I know these are not solid masses. Has anyone ever heard of breast cysts with no fluid?",

He had me go to the radiologist's office and pick up every mammo. and ultrasound I have ever had done, which was ALOT! He wants his radiologist to look over everything I've ever had done from the beginning plus have another ultrasound. I was going to this surgeon for a second opinion on the suggestion of a new doctor I have been going to who felt all this stuff in my breasts should be taken out surgically. She read my biopsy report from the lump in the other breast and became concerned. I had a core needle biopsy in the other breast 2 years ago and it showed I had either a fibroadenoma or a phyllodes tumor. The pathology report said it showed signs of being a benign phyllodes tumor. It is 2.2 cm. This new doctor said this needs to come out as all phyllodes tumors need to be removed and with margins. Everything I have read about these tumors correlates with what she says. The problem is I live in a very small town and these doctors don't know much about phyllodes. The first surgeon I went to said he had seen one in his career as a doctor and he is around 60 years old. So, I think the time has come to just have all this stuff surgically removed. I have been x-rayed and ultrasounded ad nauseum over the last 5 years and I'm tired of worrying about it all. I just want it gone! Tell me about your 2 cm. lump. You are going for an ultrasound tomorrow? When will you find out what it says? I know with your family history you must worry when anything is found.",

I would look at it this way, a mammo and an ultrasound are BOTH useful for different reasons and more detailed in their own way. If a lump shows up on a mammo, the mammo will not show if it is solid or cystic but an ultrasound will. On the other hand, an ultrasound will not show up calcifications (which can't be felt) but a mammo will. So, they should be used in conjunction with one another depending on the circumstances. If a lump is felt or shows up on a mammo, then an ultrasound is always warranted in that situation. If you have an inverted nipple that a mammo doesn't show up anything, I see no reason to NOT follow up with an ultrasound to see if that shows up anything. In my opinion, if your mammo didn't show up anything and you are having unusual symptoms (inverted nipple), you should follow up with an ultrasound.",
