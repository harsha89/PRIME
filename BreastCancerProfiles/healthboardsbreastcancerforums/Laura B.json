I use to wear padded bras, and I found out that I was very allergic to some of the material they padded the bras with. I often could not wait until I got home from work to tear off that bra. It never itched the first thing in the morning, but it got bad later in the day. I finally realized I had an allergy to the paddings, and out they went. Even though I don't wear padded bras anymore, I still get itchy some time. It is that rubber material band which is on the inside on the bottom of the bra, I still get allergic to that, sometime when I come home and take the bra off, I have like a red itchy streak on the bottom of my bobs (sp-english is not my native language). So, you may have the same problem . Laura",

I also have a mammogram every year, this time I had to go for a follow up mammogram on the left side plus an ultrasound. There also was some suspicious shadow etc. A biopsy came out positive, breast cancer. I'm a senior and have annual mammograms for the last 30 years, once in a great while I had to go back for a follow up and it always turned out to be nothing. But this year...... So don't delay, go for your follow up. Laura",

On the other hand, I'm wondering what it all means, I forgot to ask her. Is it a good sign when you don't have to take these pills? I had a lumpectomy, lymphnodes involved. Laura",

Right after the first surgery my surgeon talked about margins and micro-scan and some other confusing words. If he had said that margins were not clean I probably would have understood better. With other words, they did not get everything the first time. The age of iturner's mom is also important, it is a known fact the cancer cells grow and divide so much slower in older people. Laura",

      "Content": "I read on this board, more than once, that radiation should start within four months of the operation. I started my 6 weeks radiation exactly 2 days ago, that is 8 months after my lumpectomy. My first lumpectomy was January 30, 2008 and then they had to do a second one February 19, 2008. Surgeon explained why 2 lumpectomies, but frankly, I still don't understand why. I also had cancer in the lymphnodes. I also had 2 mammograms, ultrasound, pet scan, muga scan etc. Seems weeks went by just testing. Then I had to go through chemotherapy, 8 treatments between March 17 and August 12, 2008. I'm also concerned that my radiation was delayed like that, but with all the tests and chemo, what could I do? I actually whished I could hear from other people if they also had such a long delay with their radiation. I personnally don't think the delay with you mother is that serious since it is in the 4 months span, especially since her lymphnodes were clean and she just had a lumpectomy. I'm sure if you talk with her oncologist he or she will agree. I was told that I'm cancerfree and all these procedures are necessaary just in case. Laura",

My oncologist also sends me for a Pet Scan every six month. I had a total of 6 PET Scans since my lumpectomy and they also come out okay. My question is: Is it really necessary to have that many PET Scans? One every 6 months? Last time I refused the PET Scan and this coming January will be 12 months since my last PET Scan and I'm sure the oncologist will be after me to have again a PET Scan in January. Is it customary to have PET Scans with Mammograms that often?",

I can't complain, everyone is extremely nice, never have to wait more than 5 minutes for my treatment. Today was the first time I really complained about how uncomfortable I am with that rash and they right away called that extra person to look at the rash, I guess she is a dermatologist. The rash is definite from the radiation, I was just wondering if other people's skin is as sensitive as mine. I'm very uncomfortable, as soon a I come home I take of my top, put my cream on and run around topless in the house. Even with just a T-shirt on, I feel very uncomfortable. Laura",
