I also have friends and people I know from my Living with Cancer Support Group and Young Widows Support group(here in town). I will get in touch with them and see what they can tell me. They may have some resources and advice,etc. I will keep you posted. Best Wishes Bertha",

      "Content": "To scottishgal(Mary) I'll figure something out. I just don't know. One minute I'm thinking - well at least I'll be with my husband again.He passed away in 1999. Then I think -(or at least I'd like to believe) that people love and care about me, etc. Then my son will do something rude and I start all over again. My \"kids\" don't really know anything yet. I don't want to scare anyone until I know for sure. I am having the biopsy on May 15 but was told I won't get results til a week after that! How crazy is that??? Well at least thanks for letting me \"vent\". Best Wishes Bertha",

      "Content": "Hi- Nothing new. I just feeling like \"venting\" again. I am starting to \"freak out\" some. Now I am thinking- what am I going to do if it's terminal? Oh- I told my daughter that the cancer may have returned. I regret doing that now. She's just going to worry. Well anyway - I go in a couple of days for the biopsy. I don't think I will be going into work that day. Probably just stay home and cry. I don't know. Maybe I will try to get some things done- like homework. I attend a community college. Maybe I will go visit my daughter. I guess it will depend on how I feel. I am not sure how much cramping I will have afterwards. I guess that is all for now. I will probably post again after the biopsy. Thanks",

I do not won't to go on welfare. I've been on welfare before and it's not all that. I hope you don't mind. I understand if you don't want to answer. Thanks",

      "Content": "Wow- I don't know where you live but I don't think I want to live in a city, state or whatever where no-one seems to care. That pretty much sucks. ( Hope it's OK to say that word.) I can't say for sure whether or not I had a fear of getting breast cancer but I did get it 8 years ago and went through all of the tests, surgery, chemo, and then a year later a stem cell transplant as a precaution of it's return. I did have a lot of support from friends and family. Sad to say- I have since lost my husband to congestive heart failure. And there is now a chance that I may have uterine cancer. I go tomorrow for a biopsy. I don't really know what to tell you to help you get over your fear but some things you might do is read up on it but make sure whatever you read is very up to date not more than 1 year old or even more recent. Have regular check ups. Do your breast self exams. Don't smoke. Eat healthy. Stay in shape. I blame myself if I do now have uterine cancer because I read that being obese is a factor. And unfortunately I am overweight. Somehow the cells in your body can change or something - I don't even know how to explain what I read. I hope to God I am not scaring you worse. I don't mean to. I also hope you can find someone who is more understanding than the people you have been in contact with who tell you that you have nothing to worry about. Even if you don't- right now you ARE worried and scared and need someone to help you find a way not to worry. I hope you find help. Best Wishes- Bertha",
