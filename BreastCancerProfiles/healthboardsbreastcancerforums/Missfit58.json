I guess I shouldn't be yet, but can't help but be a bit concerned. I am 45 years old. I have never dealt with anything like this before. I guess my questions are: Has anyone else on here gotten a letter like this? If so, what was the outcome? Does anyone have any idea what the next step might be? TIA! Nancy I wouldnt worry just yet I believe that it is something little. My sister has these things on her breast that her letter said the samre thing. They were like cyst. Sometimes they call you back in to do another mamagram or even a ultrasound.Please dont worry so much. Let me know.Good Luck! Cheryl",
