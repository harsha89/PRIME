    "Content": "Hi Lady221, I had pain in my back as well. I had my surgery back in 2005 and occasionally have back pain but it improved after 6 months or so. I suspect yours may improve with time as well. Pain with breast cancer is is not a typical symptom its actually less common, most times people feel no pain with their cancer (unless it spreads to other areas of the body) which is why with out self exams we might never catch it. My humble suggestion, ask for some physical therapy, they can help with some safe stretching and exercises that can help improve your back muscles that should also help improve the pain. I know your gonna say how does stretching and exercising my already sore muscles help with pain, well it actually helps the muscles you have not have to work as hard so in turn they hurt less. Hope this helps Kili",
