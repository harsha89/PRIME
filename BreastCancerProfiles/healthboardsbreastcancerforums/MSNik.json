      "Content": "Yup. It happened to me too ! I have \"dense breasts\" and because they really couldn't get a good screening, they asked for an ultrasound as well. Everything was fine and now, when I go, they joke and say \"see you in two weeks\" because just about every time I have to go back and get an Ultrasound so they can screen me properly. I'll bet that is all it is. Good luck!",

Is there a reason you have to wait such as your work schedule or not being available at sooner times? You might want to take a day off work or even just 2 hours if they can get you in sooner. I would call them and tell them that you are really scared and you are wondering if there is any way you can get in sooner...is this the only place in town to get an ultrasound? A cyst may be nothing, but an ultrasound will confirm it. I recently had a mamo where a cyst was suspected and they told me to come back in 30 days to get an ultrasound...I refused to wait, went straight to the breast surgery center and cried asking for an appointment. The breast surgeon did a needle biopsy on me the very next day. I was really lucky. My \"cyst\" was actually a cyst and was aspirated, but I wasnt going to take the chance that it was somthing else. I have another serious disorder and anxiety is the very last thing I need in my life....I was so relieved walking out of there that I cried happy tears. I hope you have the same good news, but I would call and try for a sooner appontment. MSnik",

Its better that you have the ultrasound anyway. Of course, you still should get the mamo to make sure nothing else is going on anywhere else, but for now, just one thing at a time and the ultrasound is the right test to determine what this is. Cysts are fluid filled and not solid...solid \"masses\" are not cysts and the ones to worry about. On an ultrasound, the tech and doctor can tell the difference. You might hear the term simple cyst...this is a good thing which you want to hear! Those are usually hormonal and go away on their own. Thats what mine was but of course I was too scared to wait so I had it aspirated.. Please let us know what happens! Your on my mind! Hugs! MSnik",

Mine was extremely compassionate since she knows how terrified her patients are. They had me lay on a table in a gown, open in the font. They exposed the breast which had the lump and under ultrasound (the machine is right next to your body, the doctor located the lump on the screen. Then, she took the finest, tiniest little needle I have ever seen and punctured the lump to withdraw fluid. I too am cysty. I have had so many in my uterine area, I lost count...because of this, they immediately sent me into a second mamogram. (they had their own machine). GUESS WHAT? My lump was gone. Nothing left of it...this told the doctor that it was a cyst, it was fluid filled and when she pierced it, the fluid reabsorbed into my body..end of story for me. The whole thing took less than 30 minutes and it was over. I truly hope it goes this smoothly for you...I can promise you that there is no pain involved. I left with a tiny little bandaid on my breast which I removed a few hours later with a drop of blood on it. My doctor made me really comfortable and in fact, I had my mom in the room with me. (Yes I was 40 something, but I was scared to death!).I really hope you have the same outcome and yes, it is very possible that you will. Please let us know?",

Wear sports bras or something with support, even when you sleep and I promise, one day you will wake up and it wont hurt anymore. It just takes time... As far as the cervical biopsy goes, I have had one before also. THEY HURT! Really bad. But only when they take the sample...afterwards, it feels like cramps for a few days, but it didnt continue to hurt me after 3 days. I hope you have the same experience. I actually told my doctor that they SHOULD prescribe something prior to the cervical biopsy...she said \"if you ever need one again we will give you a xanax or something prior\". My suggestion, call your doctor. Ask if there is something you can take to take the edge off prior to the procedure. You'll be glad you did! Good luck and Im sorry you are going through this...sometimes I wish we could only have procedures done by doctors who have actually gone through them! I just had my Gallbladder out 2 months ago and what they told me to expect was not what happened. I get where you are coming from. Its frustrating!",

The fact that 2 months ago you had a clean 3D- its not \"very\" invasive! More than likely it is a cyst. They do hurt. Especially when you push on them.

What can hurt is if the mass is being pushed by your bra strap- or if you push on it hard, that can hurt..but generally speaking, it should not hurt. I had 2 masses found- both times I was scared out of my mind. One I found myself, one was picked up on a scan....both turned out to be cysts. I have also gone through a different type of cancer which I had absolutely no idea I had - it was also picked up by a yearly test. Cancer doesnt hurt until it is very far advanced. Not sure if this helps you or not, but if you are having any sort of pain, please go see your gynecologist. Dont wait... I hope you are only asking out of curiosity!",

I had a similar issue...my cyst was determined to be a \"complex\" cyst according to my mammogram. Since there is no way to know for sure that its just a cyst, they decided to do a needle biopsy...scariest day of my life! The good news is that the surgeon did a quick needle biopsy, sent me next door for another mammogram and when I came back, it was GONE! The needle aspirated the fluid and it was truly nothing to worry about. Around your period, cysts can develop; both on your breasts and your uterus...most of the time if they are just cysts, they do go away eventually....sometimes when they rupture it actually hurts until the fluid is absorbed back into your body...but once that happens, its over. You are fine. Get the mammogram if that is what they suggest...follow through. You know your body better than anyone else and do whatever they want to do to make sure that it really is \"just a cyst\". Chances are very good that this is nothing to freak out over.

I am glad to hear you say you have a partner who works at the hospital. This person is going to be your biggest support system and needs to know how to help you navigate whatever decisions you make. I assume you will hear more from the doctor next week, and the next step will probably be a referral to an oncologist. My suggestion is to listen and maybe even request a second opinion before you make any decisions...there are so many great drugs out now and so many options depending on your markers and your staging, that almost anything is possible. SO many women face this every day; which doesn't lessen your pain or feelings, but just know if others have gotten through this- you will too! Please come back and vent away...you have my support and love.",

When I went through this, I was terrified. Also referred to a breast surgeon, they did a biopsy in the office under Ultra Sound. Afterwards, they sent me next door for a mammogram. I got very lucky. My \"lump\" was gone on the ultrasound. It turned out to be a fluid filled cyst and it ruptured during the biopsy. This COULD happen to you too. The whole thing was over in under an hour and I walked out knowing it was over, The other side of this is your history. Anyone in your family have breast cancer? They say it can be hereditary...if not, thats good for you..if so, you have to get through this. Finding it while its quite small may mean nothing more than just a lumpectomy, which removes the lump and leaves your breast tissue intact. It could really be nothing. Try not to worry- okay?
