LOL. He thinks it's created by my hormones. Like the beef and chicken that contain some kind of enlargement shots, like they contain hormones, so that my right breast developed out this lump. All he wants is me stop eating beef or chicken. And wait and hope this lump would go away by time. I think the doctor did a bad job on the examination. All he did was touching it by hands. I tried to ask him to do something more serious, but he wouldn't, cuz he said the x-ray won't be able to tell if it's cancer or not. So now, I'm coming back to the \"net\", seeking for help. Thanks all for reading. I appreicate it! Yes, bc is more rare for men that women. I would ask your doctor for a second opinion. Being that you are not able to have a mamogram, they usually do an ultrasound. If you are this concerned you should be taken seriously. An ultrasound will not tell them if you have cancer, but it is a good indicator and gives basis for a biopsy. Try to get another opinion.",
