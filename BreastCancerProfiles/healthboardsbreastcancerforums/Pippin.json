      "Content": "I know what you mean about the thyroid stuff -- it took me over a year to get it right. My first doctor identified the hypothyroidism, but gave me a dose of synthroid that was much too low. When the symptoms continued (sleeping 12-14 hours a day, lethargic, unable to concentrate), he insisted that the dosage was adequate and that I was depressed and needed an anti-depressant, so he put me on an anti-depressant. When THAT didn't work, I went to an endocrinologist, who looked at my synthroid dosage and said, \"I didn't think they made a pill with that low a dosage!\" She got me straightened out within 2 months, and I've been at a good level ever since. And I know what you mean about never having a problem, then suddenly something appears. You go along believing everything is fine, the something knocks you off that complacent pedestal. I'm 53, no children or pregnancies, just became post-menopausal. I've had mammograms since I was 30 because of a strong family history of breast cancer (mother and paternal grandmother), but there has never been an abnormality. When they called me back to the hospital for the sonogram, I had tears rolling down my cheeks from the anxiety. Two days later I had the needle biopsy (husband went with me, so I wasn't so emotional). I see the surgeon this Friday. I expect the surgery is done at my local hospital in their day surgery unit, but I won't know for sure until I see the surgeon. I asked my PCP whether this was a day surgery or an overnight thing, and she said it will depend on the surgeon and whether the lump location is likely to cause a lot of bleeding. I won't know the date until I see the surgeon, but I'm sort of aiming for the first week of July at a time when my husband can get off work and be with me when I come home. Well, that's a whole lot more than you asked for! Hang in there; see if maybe a friend can go with you so you can vent and just have someone there to listen. Also, I found the nurses at the radiology center to be very supportive. I guess they see lots of worried women in their jobs. Don't be afraid to voice your anxiety.",

      "Content": "Hello everyone. I am new to this board (though I'm a regular at the Back board). A little background: I am 53, just started menopause, and have never had an abnormal reading on my mammograms. However, my mother and paternal grandmother both had breast cancer, and I started having mammograms when I was 30 because of that family history. At my most recent mammogram, they discovered two abnormalities on the left breast. I was called back in for a sonogram of the left breast, which showed the two abnormal areas clearly. The sonogram was followed a few days later with a sonogram-guided needle biopsy. The two areas turned out to be fluid-filled cysts, which were drained. They also found a third area, a hard cyst, sort of surrounded by the fluid-filled cysts. They took biopsies of both the fluid-filled cysts and the hard cyst. All came back as benign (what a relief!). However, they were somewhat puzzled about the hard cyst and, after conferring, the pathologists eventually called it a papilloma. But they were surprised by it's size (large), and said papillomas are uncommon in the breast. They recommended having it surgically removed, though they said there is no rush. My questions are: * I have read about Intraductal Papilloma -- \"a small, benign tumor that grows within a milk duct of the breast\" -- but my tumor is large (more than 1\" across). Has anyone else experienced a large papilloma tumor in their breast? * What kind of surgeon is best to remove such a growth? * Is there a connection between the papilloma and the fluid-filled cysts? * Is the papilloma a pre-cancerous tumor? I see my PCP next week to talk about surgeons and next steps. I'm feeling somewhat confused, and not at all reassured, by the \"papilloma\" diagnosis. Cordially, Pippin",

      "Content": "I don't have any definitive answers for you. Just wanted you to know that I, too, am going through the round of doctors and sonograms and biopsies for a left breast lump. The pathologists, after studying the biopsy samples, declared my lump a papilloma, which is a benign (non-cancerous) tumor. I have to have it taken out surgically. In researching these lumps and bumps and such, it seems that the great majority of them are benign. Given where you lump is, it may possibly be a cyst in the milk ducts. I've read that these are quite common and almost always benign. We'll be thinking of you and hoping for the best on Thursday.",
