      "Content": "Hi all! Last night, I was scratching my armpit and felt a lump. I tried hard not to think about it, but checked again this morning and it is definately there. I have looked up armpit lump and saw the diagram of the armpit and lymph nodes. This feels like a swollen lymph node (like when your nodes in your neck get swollen with tonsilitis) and it's the bottom node. I am planning on calling the doctor tomorrow morning since there is not much I can do today (Sunday) except pray. Wondering if your lymph nodes in your armpit could be something besides breast cancer? I am 40 and have 2 kids (11 and 8) and had a abdominal hysterectomy for massive fibroids two years ago Jan, but he left my ovaries. My maternal aunt had to get a double mastectomy for breast cancer about 10 years ago - she's fine now. I have been getting mammograms since I turned 35 - the last one in September and there was nothing. So, should I just call the mammo place tomorrow morning or who? Reg. doc? My gyn retired last year and I haven't seen anyone else cause I'm not due for my pap until June. I know I have to get it checked out asap - I'm just REALLY scared and not wanting to tell anyone (family or friends) until I know something more - so I came here to my healthboard friends for advice. Thanks!",

      "Content": "Thanks for responding and pushing me to tell someone. I called my best friend (whose mom is a BC survivor) and told her. Amazingly her mom was visiting her right then (she lives 1.5 hr away) and she told me not to freak, but that I needed to get in first thing in the morning for a check. She said she would even go with me, if I wanted. It sure does make thing easier to deal with knowing someone you love is beside you. I'm sure my hubby would too, if he knew to be worried. Like I said - I haven't told anyone except my friend and you here.",
