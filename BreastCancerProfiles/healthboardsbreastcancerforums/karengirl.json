    "Content": "I am 32 and I found a lump in my left breast that did not show on a mamogram but did show on a ultrosound. I went to 3 different surgeons that kept telling me that it was nothing. They said I was to young to worry about it and that it was probably a fibroid cyst. I finally went to another surgeon and he took it out and sure enough it was cancer and I also had 7 lymph nodes that were positive. I had 6 rounds of chemo and 35 radiations. my advise it have it removed just to make sure. You will not be at ease unless you do. I wish you luck. I have 3 young boy's and I do worry about it coming back but I try to have a good attitude and I have faith in God. ------------------ karen",
