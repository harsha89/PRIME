      "Content": "Add another one to the club. Microcalcifications detected 6 months ago, just had re-check yesterday. Radiologist said there was one area that in comparison looks 'different'. So she will be talking to my gyne about her recommendations - but I think she feels stereotactic needle biopsy is the way to go. Interesting to read all of your experiences - thanks! I've also had a swelling maybe an inch in diameter in my armpit now for 6 months, which did not show anything on ultrasound. Sometimes my armpit feels 'funny' - bothersome - can't really explain it. Anyway, onward, one foot in front of the other. Still waiting to hear from my gyne.",

      "Content": "Hello everyone. I'm back. Two weeks later. My doctor never called me. So I finally called him today. Okay, I've been busy, and did put it off, thinking, or not thinking, it was routine. He apologized, he was renovating his office, blah blah blah. How did he not get my report? ? ? ? Anyway, he said I should get a biopsy ASAP, get a consult with a breast surgeon. I started the dialing - figuring out what to do, who to go see. I did find somebody who can see me Monday. They said to go get my films and a copy of my report and bring them with me. And so I went and got them today. But, here's the kicker. The radiologist classified me as BIRADS (something like that) category 5 - highly suspicious of malignancy. She didn't tell me that when she talked to me on the day of the mammogram, and my doctor didn't say that today either. So here, I had to read this today, by myself, on the report. I also looked up what this category was, on the internet, and it said 90% of people with this category will have a malignancy. I read last night that Sheryl Crow was found to have calcifications on routine mammography and she had a biopsy the very same day! So I am quite blown away by this today. What are you going to do. Just going to have to take it day by day. And for the first time ever, my cable internet has gone out and they can't come and check it out for a week. The weather's been wacky, and here I am using dial-up on my work laptop, and I am frustrated beyond reason. I can't even do what I like to do - stuff myself with information and prepare. I guess this is supposed to an additional lesson in patience. Okay, they say God never gives your more than you can take. I'll need to keep remembering that. Anyway, thanks everyone for listening. Be well everyone. Peace and blessings, Kelly",
