    "Content": "Hello! I'm a 23-year-old woman who, for the past 8-ish months, has been noticing something strange in my left breast in particular. I'm active and (semi)-healthy, and I have no history of breast/ovarian cancer or heart disease in my family (my grandmother died of cervical cancer in her 70's, but that's about it). About 8 months ago, I started to get random shooting pains under my left breast, which sometimes radiates throughout the side as well, but not as often. They don't happen every single day - sometimes I could go days/weeks without any pain. It also doesn't seem to be related to my menstrual cycle, since it happens at random. When I do have the pain, it last for maybe a few minutes and then goes away. This morning, however, I woke up in the morning and the shooting pains were pretty intense (at least more intense than they've ever been), and I couldn't even lay down for a few minutes because they would get worse - and I still have a slight lingering feeling of that pain from this morning, which slightly radiates into my upper left arm. It does not interfere with my daily life; doesn't make me feel winded or anything. I've tried to feel for lumps many times but haven't been able to find anything. There's also been no physical changes that I've noticed between my two breasts; no dimpling, no rashes, no swelling, etc. I'm going to try and get back in with my doctor sometime this/next week, but does anyone hear have an idea as to what it could possibly be? (Also not sure if it's worth mentioning - but when I first had this pain 8 months ago, it was accompanied by nausea, cold sweats, and a fullness feeling in the chest. It lasted for about 5 days, and I wouldn't have all symptoms everyday (also also good to note that that was the ONLY time the pain was accompanied by any other symptom). I went to my doctor a few weeks after having that happen to me, and he ruled it off as nothing - but he did ask for me to get some blood work done for other things he was curious about. After I got the blood work done in January (life got in the way for about 5-6 months....) I went back a few days ago and all of my tests came back fine, and both times I went to see him my blood pressure was, as the nurse put, \"perfect\". I completely forgot to bring up the fact that I was still experiencing these pains when I saw him again a few days ago).",
