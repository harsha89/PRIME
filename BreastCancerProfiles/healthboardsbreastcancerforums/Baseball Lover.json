    "Content": "I have recently developed a couple benign breast cysts. I'm 45 and drink too much coffee so I'm not really surprised. I have been on Lexapro for three years (successfully - 5mg) and wonder if there is any correlation. Has anyone else noticed cysts forming since they started taking Lexapro? And has anyone formerly on Lexapro with breast cysts noticed any change since they quit? Thanks everyone... this is a great forum... have a great day! :",
