    "Content": "Same thing happened to me at the age of 30. Very scared. Now 12 years later and a mammo every year since 30, it's happened a few times. It may just be the way they take the screening. They had me go in for two needle biopsies over the last 12 years. They've found nothing, I guess they just want to be sure, I prefer the extra attention, but it can be very scary. Hope this helps.",
