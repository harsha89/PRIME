      "Content": "Oh wow, such a long wait. When is ur next appt.? Is it a diagnostic mammogram? The wait is definitely the worst! I'm doing pretty good. Going back to work tomorrow. My follow-up isn't till the 25th when I find out the full pathology and treatment plan but the first wait was far worse than this one. At least I know somewhat what I am dealing with. I'm feeling pretty confident about the results and think I may only have to do RADS. I can handle that and prob. still work. Hope you had a stress-free weekend",

      "Content": "Oh wow, I hope the dr. doing the biopsy says something. My doc says it doesn't look good but there is a slight chance it's a calcification due to my breast implants. He sent me for an emergency mammogram when he saw the lump. The technician said it could be up to two weeks for the results due to the long weekend but I received a call the next morning from both the hospital and the doctor. Still a glimmer of hope but not much. 5 year mark is wonderful! Congratulations Sharon! My mother is not quite 2 years yet.",
