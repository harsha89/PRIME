    "Content": "Well - On year 4 of mammograms. Started at age 31 because my mom had cancer when she was 39. I got called back the first year- cyst in my left breast and lymph node in my right. The next two appointments went seamless, but this year I got the callback. The report said no sign of malignancy but then said i needed a spot compression and ultrasound on the left breast. lots of nodules noticed and changes that they believe due to fibrocystic breast and dense tissue. My doc said not to worry that they just need a better read but that nothing showed of concern. That there were changes so they need a new baseline, but I am petrified. Of course- I was supposed to go on a business trip Wed. They can only get me in Wed morning so I'm changing my trip but hoping they can get me in tomorrow... In the interim, i am a nervous wreck... Any suggestions to manage my fear would be greatly appreciated...",
