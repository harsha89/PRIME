      "Content": "Thank you. I got tired of waiting for the free clinic and my husband made me go to the ER after the pain got so bad that I had trouble sleeping last night. They did an ultrasound and a mammogram. They said the mammogram was inconclussive but the tech was still reading it. The ultrasound found a mass that apparently is not fluid filled. The dr. told me it is the size of my pinkie. He has put me on antibiotics but said he didnt think they would work. Which confused me. He has referred me to a surgeon and said he wants it cut out and checked to see if it is malignant or benign. I am totally scared now. I am trying not to be but it is hard. My breast really hurts now that they did the mammogram. I have to call the surgeon tomorrow and set my appointment up. Any advice on this outcome? Thank you.",

      "Content": "They are getting me in today. I go this afternoon. The mammogram showed the same as the ultrasound. A mass close to 2 cm. The report also showed that their opinion was to have it cut out. I will post after I know anything. Thank you.",

      "Content": "Ok here goes. I am 40, female, in perimenopause because of a hysterectomy that took everything but one ovary. My mother has had ovarian cancer. Here is my question. I have noticed over the last week my left nipple has been real sore. I can not even stand for anything to brush over it. I have also noticed the nipple has a hard lump on the right side of it and it is pushing my nipple to the left. Also when I lay on my back to do my breast exam my right nipple of course stands up, but my left one, the one with the lump goes into my breast. I havent noticed any discharge, just painful, hard and bigger than the right one. I am trying to get an appointment with the free clinic here because I was laid off from the public school system due to budget cuts and have no insurance now. Any ideas what this may be? Thank you.",
