    "Content": "This is happening to me right now. I finally called my gyn. today and spoke to his nurse. It has been around for a few weeks and it started to hurt yesterday and more today. It is also itching now in the nipple area. The bruise is just to the side of the nipple. I can only remember one possible cause but not sure. My husband turned over in bed and sometimes he squeezes my breast when he turns. I am not small breasted, unfortunately, and they do get in the way. But I am not 100% that is what happened. And I have had no pain until now. The nurse told me that I could come in for a mammogram with special diagnostic tests ordered. I had one already scheduled for the end of the month (annual exam). Not sure what to do..if I should go in early or not. Please let me know what you found out about your situation.",
