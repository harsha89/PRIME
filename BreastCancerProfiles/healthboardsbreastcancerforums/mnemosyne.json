Is there another avenue that could be looked at? Or is this indeed the best route? Any insight/help/words of encouragement appreciated. Thank you so much!!! First of all, I'm sorry to hear about your mother's situation. I wasn't specifically familiar with your mother's condition, but I did look it up. I'm not clear as to what your mother's doctor is recommending - is it a localized excisional biopsy? If so, that apparently is the standard follow-up for atypical ductal hyperplasia, unfortunately, and is necessary to ensure that the results of the core biopsy are correct and that your mother really does have atypical ductal hyperplasia and not something a bit more troubling. If your mother isn't sure about the surgery, or is concerned about the amount of tissue her surgeon thinks necessary for a thorough evaluation, she should seek a second opinion. Also, does her surgeon specialize in breast surgery? If not, she should find someone who does. This can help minimize the amount of tissue they need to remove. In addition, your mother should ask that at least two different pathologists review the cells obtained in her biopsies. Many people don't realize that a second opinion can be obtained (and should be obtained!) from a second pathologist regarding the actual biopsy tissue. Pathologists aren't perfect, and sometimes the differences between weird benign cells and weird malignant cells are subtle, so for peace of mind, two pathologists, for sure! It's really understandable that your mother is saddened, but both you and she should look on the bright side: most women with this condition do not develop breast cancer, and there are treatments that can further reduce her risk to something equivalent to the rest of the population. If she has a family history of breast cancer, she should mention it to her doctor, and she'll need to be diligent in monitoring her condition after the excisional biopsy comes back negative (and I'm sure it will!), but she will have the satisfaction that she's taking good care of herself and that her vigilance can only help keep her healthy, or, in the alternative, catch something early should the worst happen. Good luck to both you and your Mom. I'm sure that she'll be just fine!",

I am 32 years old and I have been been getting yearly mammograms since I was 30. My Mother had her 1st bout with Breast Cancer at 38-40 years old... her 2nd at 55. My Baseline mammogram, they found calcifications and they did a biopsy, everything was clear. I went last Thursday for my yearly mammo, and this time they say they have found a high density mass. I have been searching the internet for some information ( I spoke to the nurse at my Dr. office, and she really didn't have many answers for me) Has anyone heard of this?? I cannot really find out any info on what this could be?? I am going in for an ultrasound on Monday, and if they see something a MRI... Can anyone help me out?? Thanks, Dee Dee, I hope I can help you a bit. I can understand your concern. We are the same age, and both have similar family histories (mom has ovarian ca; her sister just died at 60 of recurrent metastatic breast ca first diagnosed when she was 50; their cousin has breast cancer first diagnosed mid-forties). A mammogram is just a specialized X-ray - the breast is exposed to a low dose of radiation and the pattern of X-ray penetration shows the breast's structure just as a chest X-ray shows a shadowy version of the lungs. Fat, for example, is very \"radiolucent\" - which means that it allows x-rays through very easily, while other structures in the breast are more radioopaque to varying degrees. I think (*think*) that \"high-density mass\" means that not many x-rays (or, maybe none) can get through the mass. That could be a tumor, benign or malignant, or it could be something else entirely. There's no way to tell from the mammogram and no way to get more information just from the mammogram. All the mammogram can show is that it's there and needs to be investigated. I know that there are systemic diseases that can cause such breast masses (collagen vascular disorders like lupus and sarcoidosis), benign conditions, even diabetes can manifest sometimes as \"diabetic fibrous mastopathy\" seen as high density lesions in the breast. The ultrasound will help them rule in/out all these unusual sorts of things and figure out whether a biopsy is necessary. I don't know if that helps, but I know how hard the waiting can be. Good luck.",

A friend of mine has this problem and I would like some input on this, about medication, treatment, hospital. Thank you. private77: The five-year survival rate for women with metastatic breast cancer is not good, and there's no way to sugarcoat that. However, treatment for metastatic breast cancer is much better today than it was five years ago, and your friend certainly has a real fighting chance, especially if she's in otherwise good health, to help her survive the treatment, which sometimes seems worse than the disease. Radical mastectomy, chemotherapy and hormone treatment are among the common treatments for metastatic breast cancer. My aunt had Stage IIIc breast cancer (it spread to the axillary lymph nodes, but not beyond them), and achieved successful remission with a mastectomy and chemotherapy. A friend of mine is four years out from a diagnosis of aggressive breast cancer (I don't know the staging information), after a combination of surgery, chemotherapy, and an autologous bone marrow transplant. Your friend may already know this information, so if I were you, I wouldn't force it on her. If she wants to talk about treatment options, talk with her, but don't press on her information you've found from the internet: it can actually be counter-productive and somewhat depressing, especially if you tell her the long-term survival rate. It's hard to find the right balance between being supportive and allowing someone her space, but I'm sure you can do it. Good luck to you and your friend.",

      "Content": "JC - Your story sounds alot like my mother's story, unfortunately. My mother was diagnosed with Stage IIIc uterine cancer, with referral to the ovaries after her ob/gyn found a new mass on examine, and confirmed it via CT scan. The mass could be an ovarian cyst, or some sort of benign growth. In fact, when my mother first saw the gynecological oncologist, he thought that the growth on her left ovary was benign, until he did a biopsy of her uterus. Has your PCP done a blood test for CA-125? My mother's oncologist did not refer her to the gyn-onc until her blood test for CA-125 showed elevation. It's not a dispositive test, as CA-125 can be elevated for a number of different reasons, but it's one of those signs they take into account, along with the clinical picture. Going to a gyn-onc is the best thing you can do, and - personally - I think it's a good sign that he is penciling you in for surgery immediately, in that it shows that he will be responsive to your needs and questions. My mom waited three weeks after seeing her gyn-onc for surgery - it was his first available surgery date (small town, I suppose, only one gyn-onc, lots of sick women) and those were nerve-wracking weeks. Before you go to then gyn-onc, write down every question you can think of, all ahead of time. He/she should be happy to answer your questions, and after the appointment you'll find yourself going - damn! I should have asked that! If the gyn-onc doesn't recommend surgery, pin him down as to why and get a second opinion ASAP. I think you're right: I can't see why he wouldn't want to remove the mass. My mom felt the same way. Even when the gyn-onc initially told her she could put off her surgery a few months because he thought her elevated CA-125 was a false positive, she scheduled surgery ASAP. Thank god: if she'd waited another month or two, well, who knows how much it would have spread? It was already much worse than the gyn-onc. If the gyn-onc does schedule surgery, ask him what he considers \"optimal\" debulking? Some gynecologists consider \"visible tumors of less than 1 cm\" to be optimal debulking for a radical hysterectomy for ovarian cancer, but my understanding is that the goal really should be no visible tumors. I don't know, it's a philosophy difference. If the gyn-onc thinks the first bit is \"optimal,\" then he might not really work for the second. I'm having a bit of trouble expressing myself. Take care of yourself! Just - remember to take care of yourself. Hopefully, this will be benign, but if it isn't you can still make it through, okay? And, please let me know how things go.",

      "Content": "butterflytrans - It's she. Mnemosyne was the muse of memory, and also a she. Anyway, I wrote that earlier post before I was quite awake, so I should have made the clarification of complete cytoreduction w/surgery versus \"optimal\" debulking. I'm fortunate in that my mother had complete cytoreduction. In any case, this study found that complete cytoreduction is possible in the majority of cases, and that it has the strongest influence on long-term survival, stronger than the aggressiveness of the tumor: [url]http://www.asco.org/ac/1,1003,_12-002490-00_18-002003-00_19-00102954,00.asp[/url] Another recent study ([url]http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_u ids=12893206&dopt=Abstract[/url]), this one on patients in the U.S. comes to similar conclusions: Cytoreduction to a visibly disease-free outcome has a more significant influence on survival than the extent of metastatic disease present before surgery. Operative efforts should not be abbreviated on the hypothesis that extensive disease at specific anatomic regions precludes long-term survival.Given that, I think it's worthwhile to make sure your gynecological oncologist will be aggressive w/debulking (if necessary) rather than deciding that it's not worth while. I know that most surgeons prefer a visibly disease-free result, but if they think that 1 cm is a \"good\" outcome, will they be as aggressive in removing tumors as we (patients and/or loved ones) would like them to be, in light of such evidence above? So, that's sort of what I was getting at, but not articulating very well. I'm not really a crusader, but it is a question I would ask my mom's doctor, now, if we were starting over and didn't know to ask before/during/after, and was lucky with, too. heatherw - Did I ever say how much I appreciated your replies to me when I first came here w/questions about my mom's disease? I really did, and your aunt is an inspiration. cg - I don't want to frighten you, but my mother's ovarian tumor grew very quickly. In 8/03, she went to her gynecologist for a routine check-up and he found nothing. In 9/03 - just a month later - she went back b/c she was planning a hysterectomy for a prolasped uterus. He found the mass on exam, having never felt something like that before. Her left ovarian tumor was the size of a grapefruit. It absolutely can still be benign, and I'll pray that that is what it is. If it's not benign, remember that you can make it through, ridiculously hard as it seems now. I'm glad your husband is so involved, and I hope these posts have helped.",
