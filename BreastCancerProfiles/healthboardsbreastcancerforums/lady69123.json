      "Content": "I am 40 years old and just had my first mammogram last week. I received a letter in the mail yesterday stating I will need a bilateral ultrasound for further evaluation. I haven't spoken to my doctor because it is now the weekend, therefore, I will have to wait until Tuesday. I'm very scared and wondered if anyone had experienced the same thing. The unknown is frightening and I don't know what they found because, of course, the letter was very informal and didn't go any further than saying I will need further evaluation. This was just a routine exam and I do not have any lumps (that I can tell and the doctor didn't feel in March). Thanks to anyone who can respond.",

      "Content": "I'm back after having my breast ultrasound. I thought all was okay until my doctor called and said I have a 1 cm nodule in the upper right quadrant of my breast. The nurse said it is perfectly round with no sharp edges. She said if it had a different shape she would say it looked suspicious but she said not to be worried. I, of course, am very worried. I have an appt with a doctor tomorrow because I couldn't wait until next week when they originally booked my appt with the doctor. I haven't heard the term \"spiculated margins\" but I'm going to ask the doctor about that tomorrow and I'll reply again. caligirl",

      "Content": "Beppie I went to my doctor today and asked him about spiculated margins and he said that they are not always a bad thing but since mine was found with no sharp edges he didn't go into it any further. I still have to have a biopsy to see if it's benign and he made feel somewhat better by telling me it almost definitely looks benign. Also, he couldn't feel it when he did a breast exam. I still need that 100% reassurance from the biospy. I have to wait until June 27th to have the test. Are you going to have a biopsy. If yes, when?",

      "Content": "I finally heard from the doctor today after three phone calls. She said that my breast tissue was too thick and they couldn't see anything so that's why they are recommending an ultrasound. Whew!! Thanks so much for all your replies. It helped me so much. I appreciate you all. I love this website!!",

      "Content": "I have just been told I may have a lymph node under my left arm. The doctor cannot feel it so he wants me to get a needle guided biopsy. I forgot to ask him if a lymph node causes shoulder pain. Does anyone know if it does? I originally went to my regular doctor and she said I have bursitis (inflammation of the shoulder). Now that the other doctor thinks I have something suspicious I think maybe this is causing the shoulder pain. Can some relate to this?",
