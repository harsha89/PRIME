    "Content": "Mark- It's true, you don't hear much about men getting lumps in their breast/chest. BUT, men do have breast tissue. And yes, men can develope cysts and lumps in that breast tissue. Being on imunosupressants may have something to do with this, but anytim you find a lump in your breast it is deffinately a good idea to have it checked. It does sound like you and your family are in need of some much needed relaxation and family time, so go and enjoy yourself and your family. Keep a check on the lump, and when you get home it would be a good idea to get it checked. If there is something going on, it's much better to have it taken care of sooner, rather than later. Good Luck, and enjoy your vacation! Lezlee",
