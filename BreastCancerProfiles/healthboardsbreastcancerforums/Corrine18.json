      "Content": "I've received a call-back on my mammogram to have an ultrasound. I am a 53-year old non-smoker and non-drinker. My grandmother died of breast-cancer at the age of 84. My last mammogram, 18 months ago, was normal. A few weeks ago I started having pain and a sense of swelling (not noticible in appearance) in my left breast. No discharge or change of appearance to the shape of the breast or to the nipple. The initial, mammogram report from the test a few days ago reads : \"CC and MLO views demonstrate nodular asymmetry slightly more prominent in the retroareolar region of the left breast, the area marked on the film this is particularly on the CC projection. No other developong or dominant masses, suspicious cluster of microcalcification, skin thickening, nipple retraction or architectural distortion.\" I have an appointment scheduled for \"some time in the future\" (I'm with an HMO...) I just need an idea of what is going on and I can't get anyone to talk to me. Is \"nodular asymmetry\" a code name for cancer? - or can it be something non-cancerous?",

      "Content": "Thanks for your kind response! They called and I have an appointment to see a specialist tomorrow for more tests - an MRI and something else that I can't remember. I have used the same radiology group for mammograms for the past 4 or 5 years so they have a baseline. Next to \"BIRAD\" on the report is written \"needs further examination\" and no number, so... I guess we will see... Thanks again for responding - it helped!",

      "Content": "[QUOTE=shisslak;3786005]Corrine18 It went really well! Thank you for asking. They did another set of mammogram x-rays and still didn't like what they were seeing and then did an ultrasound right then and there - and then did more ultrasound. Then they came back and said everything looked fine and come back in a year. I knew I had fibrous cysts, and so they said that they had just looked different in the x-rays but fine in the ultrasound. Thank you for your support - it meant alot! Corrine",
