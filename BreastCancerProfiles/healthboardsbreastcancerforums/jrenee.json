      "Content": "My daughter had the same thing, a lump only on one breast and she was also complaining of pain. Breast cancer runs in our family so I hurried her to the dr. She informed me it was a \"breast bud\" and was just the begining stages of her breast developing. I had never heard of such! you can probably read up on it online, but i would take her to the Dr. It couldnt hurt better safe than sorry.. Good luck",
