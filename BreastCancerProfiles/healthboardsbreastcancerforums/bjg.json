      "Content": "not to scare you ..but a lump isnt the only breast cancer symptom Early breast cancer usually does not cause pain. In fact, when breast cancer first develops, there may be no symptoms at all. But as the cancer grows, it can cause changes that women should watch for: A lump or thickening in or near the breast or in the underarm area. A change in the size or shape of the breast. A discharge from the nipple. A change in the color or feel of the skin of the breast, areola, or nipple (dimpled, puckered, or scaly). A woman should see her doctor if she notices any of these changes. Most often, they are not cancer, but only a doctor can tell for sure.",

      "Content": "i have had several friends with breast cancer...when the initial lump is felt or seen on a mammo i have come to believe that it is the \"party line\" so to speak for the dr to tell the patient it looks feels whatever benign to him .....i believe it is a way of alleviating the patients fears til the final verdict is in..and is in no way a reflection of what the dr really thinks..as for your benign looking nodule..if it were truly normal to have these wouldnt your other breast have them as well..if they really felt it was of totally no concern..they would not have mentioned it to you at all..and you would have been scheduled in one year not 6 mos...i think the thing to remember is that in your original post you said they described it as a benign \"looking\" nodule...looking is not enough..they need to test it ..good luck",
