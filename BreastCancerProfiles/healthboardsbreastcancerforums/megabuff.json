      "Content": "I though this article may be of interest Chemicals from underarm deodorants and other cosmetics can build up inside the body, according to a recent study. British researchers have found traces of chemicals called parabens in tissue taken from women with breast cancer. While there is no evidence parabens cause cancer (breast cancer or any other cancer), the scientists have called for the use of parabens to be reviewed. The cosmetics industry insists the chemicals, which are used as preservatives and are approved for use by regulators, are safe. Dr Philippa Darbre and colleagues at the University of Reading carried out tests on samples of 20 different human breast tumours (Breat Cancer). Writing in the Journal of Applied Toxicology, they say they found traces of parabens in every sample (of breast cancer tumour). Their tests suggested the chemicals had seeped into the tissue after being applied to the skin. \"This is the first study to show their accumulation in human tissues,\" said Dr Darbre. \"It demonstrates that if people are exposed to these chemicals, then the chemicals will accumulate in their bodies.\" Dr Darbre said there may be reason for people to be concerned about the findings. \"Their detection in human breast tumours (breast cancer) is of concern since parabens have been shown to be able to mimic the action of the female hormone oestrogen,\" she said. \"Oestrogen can drive the growth of human breast tumours (breast cancer) . It would therefore seem especially prudent to consider whether parabens should continue to be used in such a wide range of cosmetics applied to the breast area including deodorants.\" for further information see [url]www.bodiorganic.com/parabens.htm[/url] What do you think about this?

      "Content": "maybe Debbie but then who would pay for such studies? Certainly not the cosmetic companies. Perhaps you would be interested in some more information from the Environmental Working Group [url]http://www.ewg.org/reports/skindeep/index.php[/url] or the Green peace site [url]http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/Products/Toxics/index.cfm[/url] These are 2 independant sites promoting the truth and trying to improve the planet.
