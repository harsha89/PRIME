      "Content": "Since I was 12, around the time I was beginning to develop, I have had this pea-sized lump located in my right nipple. It seemed to appear overnight but has never caused me any pain at all and has not grown at all in size since then. We assumed this was some type of breast bud that never went away. Time from time, it has caused me concern just for the simple fact of having a lump in my breast, but never to the extent it has recently. You see this past November right before Thanksgiving my Mom was diagnosed with Stage II breast cancer. To give you an even better picture of the amount of stress I was going through that time, I was also just three weeks away from graduating from college with finals still to go. Since then I have been prodding and poking all over my chest, armpit, breast areas. I have suffered to episodes of extreme discomfort on the right side where the pea-sized lump is located (both coming oddly around the time of my menstrual cycle). During these episodes my shoulder feel so tense and painful, I would wake up with my arm hurting as well. There has also been a deep chest pain (note: around this time my dog stepped on that exact chest area as I was laying down) and at times it feels like I have a weird lump in my throat feeling. I know this could very well be attributed to stress and anxiety. The week of graduation I came down with the a horrible head cold and more the once I have felt myself wanting to have a horrible anxiety attack. So my question is, does this seem like just stress that is bringing these symptoms on all of a sudden? Or could this be something worse? I know I will soon need to be getting myself checked for the best interest of myself, but I was just wondering what everyone else though. Sorry for the long post!",

      "Content": "I posted a thread about practically the very same thing. I am 22 with a small hard lump on my areola that I first noticed around the I began developing (12 years-old). I never thought much of it because it hasn't grown or changed, doesn't hurt. My only concern now is because my Mom was recently diagnosed with breast cancer and I wonder if this should be cause for concern.",
