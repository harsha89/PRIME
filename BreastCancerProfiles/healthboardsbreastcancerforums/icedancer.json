    "Content": "What other things might cause a nipple to go inverted other than breast cancer? My left nipple has been sporadically turning inward and the area is slightly itchy including my entire breast. My doctor doesn't think it looks like Paget's and she felt no lumps. She has me applying yeast medication to the entire area, but it isn't helping and it makes no sense to me why I would have gotten a yeast infection there. Anyway, I found one health website that mentioned there were other possibilities for nipple inversion, but they weren't listed. Every other website I have been to just mentions cancer. I'm going in for a mammagram tomorrow and I'm really nervous. Thanks for any input you can give!",
