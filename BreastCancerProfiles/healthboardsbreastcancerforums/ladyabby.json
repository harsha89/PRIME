      "Content": "Kristin, you have to take charge of your health. If one doc's answer doesn't seem right, then get another opinion. The fact that you have two sisters diagnosed with breast cancer premenapause would give me enough cause and determination to find someone who was going to give a reason for the pain. I have a very strong family history of breast cancer, maternal grandmother, mother, sister and several cousins who have been diagnosed so I read everything. I've had four biopsies in the last 15 years, all benign, thank goodness. Call the American Cancer Society and see if they can recommend a breast specialist in your area. Good luck, Amy",

What did your doctor suggest as treatment for you? Please keep in touch.",

When that stopped working, the docs used arimidex and a couple of other drugs. I took Tamoxifen for 5 years due to the high risk of breast cancer in our family. That was 8 years ago and I was 44 years old, pre-menapause. With me I was basically thrown into menapause, hot flashes, mood swings, large weight gain. I don't even know if it was worth it. I am waiting for results of a stereotactic breast biopsy that I had done today to have microcalcifications biopsied that were found on my annual mammogram last month. I hope this helps.

Thought I would just give you a little info about what to expect with the wire localization that you are to have done. I had a lumpectomy (dx'd with invasive carcinoma in August) and they had to do the same thing before the procedure. They will position you like you were having a mammogram. Based on those films, they use a hollow needle to localize the area all while being compressed. You will be given local anesthetic and shouldn't feel anything...if you do, tell them & they will give you more anesthetic. After they find the area, they slip a needle through the hole & it has an anchor that will attach to the tissue to keep it in place. It's not fun but not unbearable. Will keep you in my thoughts and prayers.",

You lay on a table with your breast hanging through a hole but the table is padded. They compress your breast while they mark where the calcifications are. But the compression wasn't as tight as it is during a regular mammogram. With me, they first numbed the breast with lidocaine and all I felt was a pinch. The surgeon made a small cut just big enough to insert the probe that would collect the tissue. From then on, I felt nothing. They shot a \"marker\" that permenantly stays in the breast, so if the results were malignant, the surgeon would be able to find the area and radiologists will watch this area when future mammograms are done. They took some films before they removed the tissue. It sounded like a vacuum cleaner was running while she removed 8 tissue samples. After she took the samples, they xrayed the tissue to make sure the calcifications were retrieved. I had minimal bruising with very little pain or discomfort. I know that you're very scared but remember most biopsies (80%) are benign. Mine was. Let me know how things go. I hope this helped.",

Calcifications are quite common in women but what determines if they need to be biopsied are their size, their appearance, are their borders regular or irregular, are they scattered or clustered, etc. In my case they were clustered tightly and my mammo's BIRAD rating was 4, meaning that it was highly suspicious. I had the procedure and it was benign, the calcifications were caused by tiny cysts that were not picked up on the mammogram. 80% of microcalcifications when biopsied are benign. I know how nervous and confused you must be, you're right, the waiting is terrible but please try not to panick. I have a very high instance of breast cancer in my family and have had several open and needle biopsies prior to the stereotactic one and so far all has come back good.

What determines if they are classified as suspicious are their size, are they regular or irregular shaped, are they clustered in a group, etc. They sometimes do indicate the pressence of cancer but 80% of those biopsied turn out to be benign. I had to have a stereotactic biopsy in 2008 when my mammo showed tightly clustered microcalcifications. The radiologist gave it a BIRAD's rating of 4 which is highly suspicious. I have a very strong family history of breast cancer so I was conerned. The results came back benign, the calcifications were due to tiny microscopic cysts that did not show up on the mammogram. My advice as to whether to wait the 6 months for a repeat mammo or to ask for a biopsy would be to go with your gut feeling. If you're ok with waiting then do so, but if you're uneasy about going that route, ask for the biopsy. If it were me, I'd have the biopsy even if I didn't have the breast cancer historyl",

      "Content": "Hi Tara, From what I've been told and read, any description stating round, oval, smooth leans towards benign findings. I was recently diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma, stage one. Very close to that mass was a complex firbroadenoma. Pathology on that showed lobular carcinoma insitu which is not a true cancer but a high risk marker...meaning that it could at some point change. Keeping on top of your breast health is very stressful but it is doable. As far as the dr. wanting to do a biopsy on the enlarged axillary node, I think it's a good thing that she did. Show's that she/he is very thorough when dealing with the unknown. It gives me great peace to know that so much is available with testing, diagnostic and treatment options. Remember that 80% of \"suspicious\" findings turn out to be benign. Let us know when you get the results.",

      "Content": "I was just diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma and lobular carcinoma insitu on 8/9/14 and I can't stress enough that if something doesn't feel right and your dr. won't work with you on it, then get another opinion. A little hx about me...am 58 yo with strong family history of breast ca...maternal grandmother, mother both diagnosed in their mid 50s. So I have always been consistent with doing my yearly mammos, monthly self exams, having 2 clinical breast exams yearly and I even took a 5 year course of Tamoxifen when I was in my early 40s. Over the past 20 years, I have had 5 biopsies, which all came back benign except this last one. A few weeks ago, I started noticing that my right breast would ache/throb...it wasn't terrible but it felt different. Before menopause, I always had painful, lumpy, fibrocystic breasts and was always told when I had my mammograms that I had very dense breast tissue but since going through menopause, I haven't had any breast discomfort in years. So I made an appt with my gyn and he did an exam and said that he really didn't didn't feel anything of concern but due to my history ordered an diagnostic mammo and US. Had the tests done and the radiologist said that there was no change on the mammo but that he \"didn't know what he was looking at\" on the US and recommended a US needle guided biopsy. I made an appt with a breast surgeon who sent my films down to their breast imaging. The radiologist called me herself the next day and said \"yes, she agreed that their was no change on the mammo but that she was very concerned about the US\". She saw 2 masses, one that she was extremely concerned about and scheduled the biopsy the next day. She explained that her facility was using a new technology, designed as a diagnostic tool for patients with dense breast tissue. It is called Contrast Enhanced Spectrum Mammogram (CESM) and was developed by GE. I was given an iodine contrast via IV (similar to how a CT is done) It uses the standard mammogram equipment and takes 2 images of each side, 1 image identical to the mammogram. Dense breast tissue shows up as very bright, busy imaging that they refer to as \"noise\". The 2nd image utilizes the CESM technology and hides all the \"noise\" so that the only thing that are highlighted are abnormal areas. So, the 2 masses that she saw lit up like a light bulb. I went from the mammo room to US where she did 2 biopsies. She called me 3 days later with the cancer diagnosis and am now in the process of endless dr. appts and testing. My advice to you would be to have your breast imaging done at a breast imaging facility because that's all they do all day, every day. Ask questions and if something doesn't sound right, get another opinion. When I got my imaging and pathology reports, I sent my reports to John Hopkins. It is a lot of information thrown at you and there are a lot of decisions that need to be made, so it gave me peace of mind to know that what was being done in my case was considered standard/correct care. Good luck and keep it touch.",

      "Content": "Hi, I was on Tamoxifen for 5 years for preventative reasons due to an extremely high breast cancer history in my family. I experienced the fatigue, the hot flashes, the mood swings and gained a lot of weight. These are all common side effects of the drug and I knew that before I started taking it but I felt that the benefits were worth it. Now, 6 years after having stopped taking it, I'm working very hard trying to get the weight that I gained while on the drug off. But again, I think the benefits are worth it. Good luck, Amy",
