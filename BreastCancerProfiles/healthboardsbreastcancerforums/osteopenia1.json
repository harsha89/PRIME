      "Content": "My breast cancer was also triple negative, stage 1, grade 3, no lymph nodes were cancer. I had a lumpectomy with margins, then a second lumpectomy with a new tumor (6mm) larger than original and margins found. Now I needed a mastectomy but first 4 sessions of chemo. I had the mastectomy 8 weeks ago and no cancer was found. So I am considered in remission with a checkup in August. I hope this helps. I had a choice of a third lumpectomy with radiation or a mastectomy with no radiation. I am glad I chose the mastectomy.",

      "Content": "Tumbleweed As to your question why it took so long to sort out my cancer - first lumpectomy showed still some margins so went in again. Second lumpectomy discovered a new lump plus margins. Then mastectomy removed the whole breast which was cancer free due to chemo first. Oncologist says mammograms have 10% error and I believe the radiologist has at least another 10% or more from what I experienced. My chemo drugs were Taxotere and Cytoxan. Then since i had a breathing problem with Taxotere on my second session. For my 3rd and 4th session I had Cytoxan and Adriamycin. I had 4 sessions, 3 weeks apart. Taxotere gave me severe body aches. Also after 9 days I had low white blood cell count plus fever and spent 4-1/2 days in hospital in isolation. After the next 3 sessions (l day after) I was given a shot of Neulasta which kept my temperature down but I still had to stay home so I didn't catch anything for a week each time. I had to have a PICC installed (catheter) in my arm for the Adriamycin to go in. That was installed too far in near my heart and caused flutters so another problem. Maybe your daughter will get a port which they say is better? My chemo didn't cause a problem for the first day or two but after that side effects start. Food taste is off and appetite is gone but one has to force something down. Drink alot and walk around. Ginger tea helps. Everyone is different and different drugs matter. Any more help I can be, just ask.",

      "Content": "Nancy 104 Last month I had a biopsy of a solid lump that did not have smooth edges and it turned out fine although I need to come back in 6 months. They placed a micro chip in the area so that it can be identified next time it is looked at. I had to lie face down for the biopsy and my breast hung down in a hole. It was not painful since it was deadened by novicane but being in that position so long was hard on my neck and shoulder. I turned my head to the side which was better than face down. Hope this helps. Remember most lumps turn out fine.",

Then have another mastecomy if the other one is a problem later. I had a single mastecotomy after two lumpectomies plus chemo. A double mastectomy plus reconstruction sounds like a major deal but maybe you are young. I was 76. Good luck whatever you choose. I know it is hard to know what to do.",

It was true in my case that the mammogram did not pick up a 6 mm lump even thouigh it picked up a 4 mm one that started the whole process. Think about never needing another mammogram again EVER! I was surprised after my single mastectomy how fast recovery was. I did the exercises after and now after 4 months I am healed and able to garden and lift things and feel like a young girl again on one side. I did not have reconstruction but when I have my falsie on, I don't miss that breast at all. Three surgeries were enough!! Keep in touch. God Bless.",

Request either a shorter waiting time, maybe 3 months and if the abnormal areas are still present, request a biopsy to insure that all is well, or request a referral to a breast surgeon for an immediate biopsy. There is nothing wrong with being proactive and confident that all is well. Keep me updated on what you do. Brenda",

      "Content": "Since my mammogram showed a problem, I had an ulter-sound. It showed a dark area and two smaller dark areas underneath. The radiologist says I should get it checked again in 6 months to see if it changed. Several years ago I had a cyst aspirated at another clinic and it tested out good. Is this waiting period a new approach? Personally, I would rather had it dealt with instead of waiting. Isn't that the purpose of a mammogram - to catch a problem before it turns into cancer? Has anyone had a similar situation and what happened 6 months or more later?",

      "Content": "I went to a larger clinic for a second opinion. The radioligist looked at the previous films and wasn't concerned with the fluid filled cycts but found a firm cyst in another area. He had another mammogram done and ultra-sound and advised a breast biopsy which I had today. I laid face down with breast in a hole. More mamograms and now I have to wait until Monday or Tuesday for results. I am glad I didn't wait for 6 months. If this is cancer, it would have grown by waiting 6 months. Little pain with procedure but hard on neck and shoulder in that position for an hour.",
