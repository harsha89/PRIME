      "Content": "thanks for the reply Tryhonesty, i never noticed lumps before and i dont really feel any now so maybe mine are small and hopefully they only will come when i have my period...it is common for women to have fibrocystic breasts so im not really worried about it, i just hope the lumps are normal and not cancerous",

      "Content": "hey smithn, I'm only 20 yrs old... so the lady ( she is not a certified doctor but a women who specializes in womens health..she is a gyno) I saw said that you might not see anything from a mammogram but i'm going the 25th to get checked out and I believe they will do a mammogram because the women i went to said not to wear lotion or deoderant. I have to go after my period and I think that the lumps or cysts will go down (i have never felt them before, and my breasts were swollen when i went to see the specialist). When my breasts are not swollen it will be easier to detect any lumps. I will keep you updated on my results, hopefully i will be okay I pray that I will be okay...",
