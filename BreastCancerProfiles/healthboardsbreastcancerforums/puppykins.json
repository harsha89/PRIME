    "Content": "Hi! I am post menopausal and will be 52 this month. I had some postmenopausal bleeding and my Dr. sent me for tests. I also went for my yearly mammogram. I was so worried about uterine cancer but thank goodness all the tests came back fine. But, I wasn't prepared for my Dr. to tell me my mammogram came back suspicious! He said it showed an area of thickening that was never there before. I have to go back for a lateral mammogram, cone compression, and an ultrsound. He told me not to worry cuz he didn't feel any lumps. My husband told me not to worry cuz it is probably nothing. Easy for them to say....I am worried. Anyone else experience this?",
