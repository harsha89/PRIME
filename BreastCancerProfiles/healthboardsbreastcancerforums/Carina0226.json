    "Content": "My mother in law had a suspicious growth on her uterus when she was 86. She refused to have it removed. It kept growing and growing and four years later it became painful. Her doctor urged her to go into hospital and a biopsy was performed and it turned out to be a cancer. She died seven days later of heart failure. We believe her sudden death was as a result of the painful and degrading treatment she was subjected to in hospital. Why am I telling you this? Please take great care when urging someone in their late 80s to do something they don't want. If she really wants to live, she will agree to the biopsy being performed. If she doesn't want the lump to be removed, well, chances are, it is ER+ and her doctor may suggest Tamoxifen alone, without surgery. Depending on the size of her lump and given that BC generally grows more slowly in the elderly, she may not live long enough to die from it. At her age she could drop dead any day. Maybe she simply does not want to be bothered with something she considers of vely little relevance. Please pass my kind regards to you gran Carina from Germany",
