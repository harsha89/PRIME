      "Content": "That experience you've had you never mentioned ( at least not in answers to me ), and actually I would like to hear the exact things you experienced ( if you are willing to share them , and I guess you are , since you are on the HB, maybe just got tired of repeating ? ) Not just the statistics and words everything will be ok. You say, fibroid cysts, I never heard that before, so I don't know what kind of cysts are those. I had some \" cancerous scare \" in my life already ( cancerous colon polyp found just on time 14 years ago, found again last year, because I have my colonoscopies regularly ), (cancerous lesion found on my cervix on time 13 years ago ) so of course I'm afraid that this is my third kind of cancer scare, and I would like to do everything I can to find it on time if that's possible. I don't like exams, mammograms and biopsies, etc, either. I would like to just let it go , and believe when a dr. say it's probably nothing , but it's stronger than me , that PROBABLY is not good enough for me. Thank you again for your responses, I appreciate them.",

Even when I told her my concern about the screening mammogram missing something because it's just a screening one. I asked her what she thinks about seeing an endocrinologist because I have pain in my armpit too, she said I don't need that either. I can't believe how confident is that dr. based on a screening mammogram only. I will seek a second opinion , but then I have to go out of their network, because I'm sure another dr. who works for the same hospital ( and probably know her ) won't say anything different no matter what. And I will see an endocrinologist too. I'm a person who worries for every little thing, but I couldn't forgive myself if I don't do everything I can.",
