      "Content": "Hey Happy! I hear you big time lol I have been called back the past 4 to 5 years after my mammogram for ultra sound! I'm getting to where I hate the once of year check because I know there will be drama lol I have lots of cysts that show up also. Do you drink coffee,,,cokes? Cutting back on caffein does help and the one year that I did that the whole year,,,I didn't get called back for ultra sound. Hang in there,,,,,Sounds like you are up against same thing. Let us know how it turns out!",

      "Content": "CJ,,,,No disrespect because I can only imagine how hard it is to be told that you do have breast cancer! My complaining on the side was just that,,,a little complaining but I don't take the issues at hand lightly at all and fear will not keep me from my yearly mammos! I feel very fortunate that they are keeping a close watch. Congratulations on Beating Breast Cancer,,,,I'm sure that was not a easy journey!",
