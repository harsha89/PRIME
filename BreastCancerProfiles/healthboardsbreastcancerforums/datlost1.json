    "Content": "Yes, I discovered a small firm lump right under my right nipple 2 months ago. It hurts a little when it gets touched. Done some research on the net, everyone tells people to go see a doctor. LOL. So I did. The doctor pretty much had no specific answer for me. Just kept saying it's rare for men, well, I know that! LOL. He thinks it's created by my hormones. Like the beef and chicken that contain some kind of enlargement shots, like they contain hormones, so that my right breast developed out this lump. All he wants is me stop eating beef or chicken. And wait and hope this lump would go away by time. I think the doctor did a bad job on the examination. All he did was touching it by hands. I tried to ask him to do something more serious, but he wouldn't, cuz he said the x-ray won't be able to tell if it's cancer or not. So now, I'm coming back to the \"net\", seeking for help. Thanks all for reading. I appreicate it!",
