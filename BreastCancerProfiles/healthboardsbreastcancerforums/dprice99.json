      "Content": "Hi everybody, I am 34 years old and had a complete hysterectomy when I was 30 years old. I am on hormone pellets too. I am saying all that because two months ago I noticed a lump under my right armpit. I had a mammogram and it didn't show anything. Then they did a ultrasound of the lump under my armpit. My doctors office had told me to go see a surgeon. Well I waited two and a half hours to see him where he barely felt or looked at it and sent me on my way. So i am going to get a second opinion. Had to wait a whole month to see another surgeon and they called and cancelled the appt till a whole nother month. So now i am going to find a surgeon that can see me sooner. Because I have been worried to death about the lump. And I heard being on hormones can increase your risk of getting breast cancer. So, i am kind of scared. I will feel better when i get to see a surgeon.",

      "Content": "No they didnt. I wished they had. I still feel kind of uncomfortable. I didnt really get any real answers. I am so tired all of the time. I get tired of being tired all of the time. I am on hormones too and I have been having horrible night sweats. It feels like my body is just wore out. I dont feel like something is right. But, maybe it is all in my head. So, I dont really know where to go from here.",

It is probably nothing but something inside me tells me there is something wrong with me. But, I don't know maybe I am worrying for nothing. I mean my blood test have been fine. Maybe I am reading to much on the interenet. I don't know.",

It's not like I want something to be wrong with me but I do want to know if there is something wrong with me. If that makes any sense. Have you had cancer uptown? And if you had what kind of cancer did or do you have?",

      "Content": "The surgeon said it was a cyst and if it got to hurting he would remove it. He said it was normal for other lymph nodes to swell. He said you have lymph nodes all over your body. But, I didn't really get any relief. I hate to say that but that is how I feel. What do you all think?",

      "Content": "Thank you. My husband keeps on saying it is nothing and he agrees with what the surgeon said. I made another appointment a month ago with another surgeon and my appointment was supposed to be tomorrow and they called and cancelled a couple of days ago saying he had some unexpected surgerys and wanted me to come in another whole month and I just couldn't wait that long. I have been worried to death. of course I guess I make myself worry more because I google lump under my armpit. But I just want to have a biopsy where I can have peace of mind. I want to know either way. I had a hyterectomy when I was thirty and am on hormones and I know that can increase your chances of getting breast cancer. My husband though makes me think I am crazy for worrying about it. But this is my body not his. And if the small chance I have cancer I would rather go ahead and get treatment instead of it progressing more.",
