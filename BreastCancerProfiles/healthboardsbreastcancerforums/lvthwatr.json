    "Content": "Hi, I recently had a mastectomy after being diagnosed with breast cancer. I am stage 2, ER negative, PR negative and HER2 positive. I am extremely opposed to chemo, mostly because they seem to have tons of research on how many people die if they don't take it, but little on the long term effects if you do. I am only 42 and have talked to so many people who have side effects that have lasted many years and probably will last their entire lives. Of course there isn't an oncologist on the planet who will tell me chemo isn't necessary. Why they don't have a test for cancer is pretty amazing to me. They sure are able to find plenty of drugs and chemo to make the drug companies rich, but nothing to even tell you if their drugs are doing anything. I would love to know if there is any avoidance tactics a person who is HER2 positive can use, being negative to all the other receptors. Did you happen to run into any research in your pursuit for your chemo avoidance surgery? Thanks",
