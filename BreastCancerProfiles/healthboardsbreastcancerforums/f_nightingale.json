    "Content": "I had a right mastectomy on May 18/04. The incision is healing well, but I continue to experience sharp, stabbing sensations under my right arm. Could this be the nerves growing back again? It almost feels like something sharp has been left in following surgery. I would like to hear from anyone who has the same feeling in the armpit area.",
