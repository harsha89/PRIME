    "Content": "Hello everyone, made this account just to get some opinions on this weird pain I've been having for about a year now. So occasionally I get a harsh, stabbing pain on either side of my upper torso about four inches below my armpit, to the sides of my breasts (I think there may be some gland there? Not sure). Anyways, the pain will happen on either side and sometimes on both sides and lasts for several minutes at a time before disappearing. This happens to me maybe once or twice a month and has been occurring for nearly a year. I'm not sure if this pain is something to be worried about or if it is just soreness from being an active person. I don't really have any other major health problems that would connect to this pain. Any ideas?",
