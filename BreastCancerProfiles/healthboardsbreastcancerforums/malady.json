      "Content": "I am having surgery on October 15th. I will try to make my mind up soon. A lot to think about. My feelings at the moment is should the Surgeon report that she feels they have got all the cancer and if she doesn't consider me to be at a high risk, then I may not have radiation now but if it should come back later then I would probably go for the radiation the second time. Hard decision to make.",

      "Content": "I have just been diagnosed with breast cancer 1.2 cm Stage 1. I am having a lumpectomy and following this I have the choice of radiation. 30% change of it coming back without radiation or 3% chance with radiation. Has anyone decided to not have the radiation and if so, how did you make out?",
