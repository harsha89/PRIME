      "Content": "Hi Panama. sorry to hear about this. I am not sure exactly where her lump is but she found it by shaving. she had it removed yesterday. She will not find out the results until next week. i am praying for her everyday. it is weird because my sister and I feel very positive. when she had the lump in her breast we were not that positive and worried. i am feeling better about this. have you had any history of breast cancer? it could be a number of different things. my friends father had a lump and it turned out to be a calcium deposit???? Good luck to you and hope the best. keep me updated ((((((((((((((((HUGS)))))))))))))))))))) ))))))))",

      "Content": "My mom had breast cancer 3 years ago. it was treated with removal and that was it. the doctor said it was not aggressive and the tumour was not that big. she found a lump in her armpit and is getting this removed soon. The doctor said since the lump is soft and moves around that this is a good sign. when my mom saw the surgeon he did not seem as positive as the doctor. What could this lump be if it is not cancer???",
