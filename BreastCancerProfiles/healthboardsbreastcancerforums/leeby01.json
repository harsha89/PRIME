    "Content": "We have some things in common. Years ago I mentioned that my arm would hurt from pain that started in my breast, went into my armpit and then into my arm. I was sent for a mammo and they said everything looked fine. I was put on Natural Vit. E the week before every period and it did give some relief. Well, three years later I now have the pain again and it's not in relation to my cycles. My one armpit appears thicker than the other. I feel no lumps but definate areas of pain in breast, arm pit and one spot on my arm. Please let me know how you made out. I'm all stressed out again over this. I've had two breast cancer scares already, so I've had mammos, ultrasounds and even a breast MRI last year. I scheduled my mammo for this year. My aunt had breast cancer as did a great aunt so I'm watched closely. It's just so hard to deal with again.",
