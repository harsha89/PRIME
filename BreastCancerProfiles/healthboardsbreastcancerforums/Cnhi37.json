      "Content": "I've been barely able to function I'm so frightened. I went for my annual gyno exam. A little background, I have severe anxiety and dread going to the doctor. So I mustered up all the courage I could just to go. I was so focused on the uncomfortable part of the exam I had forgotten the do a breast check. So I laid back and she performed the exam on my right breast. She palpitated on one area and a look of concern washed over her face. She said you have a cyst. We need to have checked out. I was in shock. She made small talk about my kids and I answered but my insides were screaming with fear. She takes me into another room and I'm sure I heard 'breast two inches'...two inches? I left in a daze, and was called the next morning for bilateral mammogram and ultrasound. They scheduled it for Valentines Day :-( I called back and said could I please have the next available appointment as I was extremely anxious. So they moved me up to Monday. Now I have barely been able to function. I'm 37 and never even was thinking of mammogram until I was 40. I had a CT scan from the neck down a couple months back for lung nodules the pulmonologist said she was 99.9 sure it wasn't cancer but recommended another CT in six months. Now I'm worried its all connected. My boyfriend tried to reassure me that a CT would have probably picked up a mass in my chest. But I read otherwise. I just wonder if physicians take into account people's mental conditions. The waiting is agonizing. I've been preparing a will and everything. Not to mention at every phone call I'm afraid my gyno will have results of abnormal pap. This weekend is going to be agonizing and scary. I just needed an outlet because no one seems to understand what I am going through. Sorry for rambling on.",

      "Content": "Thank you for your kind responses. Tomorrow morning is my appointment. I'm told I will know something from the ultrasound but the mammogram results will take a few days. I'm in awe of everyone's bravery on here. I'm so glad I found this board.",
