      "Content": "I had a mammogram last week. I just received a letter in the mail that says the following: Your recent mammogram, although read as normal, demonstrated \"heterogeneously dense breasts\" or \"extrememly dense breasts.\" It says that there have been recent changes in the law that requires them to notify me. It says that I could go on to have an ultrasound but it increases the chance of a false positive result and more uneccessary testing and biopsies. It says that having significantly dense breasts does not mean it is abnormal or that any suspicious areas have been detected. It also says that most insurance does not pay for the ultrasound. I'm 41, this is my second mammogram and last year it stated normal and there were \"no significant abnormalties\", whatever that means. I'm thinking that the one last year also showed density but maybe it wasn't required by law last year? I have been taking birth control pills for almost a year. Could that cause dense breasts? Has anyone been in this position? Did you have the ultrasound?",
