I'm not saying that you should take this lightly you do need to be vigilant, but not all lumps turn out to be harmful here's the link to my original thread: [url]http://www.healthboards.com/boards/showthread.php?t=410332[/url]",

Just an update, back from my enjoyable family holiday and the lump in my right breast has shrunk to almost nothing, the lump on my left breast has gone. I havn't as yet gone to the docs it seems that the right hand lump is following the history of my left one, hopefully just blocked glands",

      "Content": "Hi I realise that lumps in the breast area is mostly a female problem but I have a problem and hope you can help... A few weeks ago my nipples and the surrounding area became very sore followed not soon later by a lump approx 5mm across on the edge of the nipple area. That went down and the soreness went after a couple of weeks but I have had another develop on the other nipple. About the same size as the other and it doesn't move, it's been there for a couple of weeks now.. I will go and see a doctor if it's still there in 2 weeks. Last year I had a kidney transplant so am on immunosuppressant drugs. The family had a miserable time last year and we are to go on a long overdue holiday next week so don't want to spoil anything for my family, they deserve that holiday..",
