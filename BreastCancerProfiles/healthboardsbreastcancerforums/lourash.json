      "Content": "Well , I am not sure what to think or do. I went to the surgeon yesterday and most people say he shouldn't be practicing he is a quack. Anyway he did a ultrasound and says there is no cyst in the right breast which has the discharge. He did not even look at the nasty discharge. He then found the large cyst on the left one. He told the nurse get me a needle and wiped me off and whammo stuck the needle in. OUCHEEEE did it hurt he could not get the fluid out so he pulled it and jammed it again in a different spot. He then threw the fluid away and said it will probably come back so I will see you in a few months and aspirate it again. It bled alot and it hurt to have the aspiration it was already black before I left the office. I am not sure what to think the doc that sent me there wanted it to be looked at the lab for infection or cancer cells. My husband is not a happy camper and someone else who is a nurse said I should be on antibiotics since the discharge is green. I still have the darn discharge and have had for over two weeks. My hubby wants me to get a second opinion , but I don't want to look like a fool . Maybe I should just leave it alone.",

      "Content": "Ok I , picked up my final report from the mammogram and u/s I had yesterday. It says I have a 2cm cyst with numberous smaller cysts around it at 10 O' clock in my left breast. Where is 10 O clock in the breast ??? it says I have another 2 cm sharply defined structure at 9 o'clock in the right breast. It also says prominence of fibrogladular tissue . What the heck does that mean fibrocystic ?? They want me to see a surgeon Next week , but I don't see what the big deal is. I just wonder if the numberous smaller cyst around the big one will be a problem.",

Anyway I have gray discharge from one breast and now she is insisting it could be something to worry about and is really pushing for a mamogram . I thought only bloody discharge was a sign of cancer . Anyone else have this discharge and was everything ok? I am not worried about this and would rather concentrate on my urology visit for the bloody urine and pain.",

      "Content": "Hi again hope everyone is doing well. I hope I am on the right post! I have been at 3 doctors in the last two weeks. First I started out with lower right side pain. They found lots of blood and no infection in my urine. Ultrasound showed enlarger ovary and complex cyst. So they refer me to a urologist for the blood. In the meantime the ovary is really hurting so after biting the bullett I decide to go to a GYN. I have never had a pap since my hysterectomy 6 years ago and have not a breast exam in 9 years. I also have never had a mammogram. She noticed a gray discharge I think it looks green. She said that is not normal especially since it comes out of only one breast. She knows how I feel about mammograms but scheduled a diagnostic mammogram. i had a ct that showed an enlarged ovary and nothing noted about a cyst. And I still have blood in the urine so I have to have a cystoscopy next week. Just wondered if anyone else on this site had to have a mammogram due to nipple discharge and what it turned out to be. I am sure I am not the only one that does not like the idea of having a mammogram , I just really really do not want to go thru with it.",

      "Content": "I have a couple of other posts already , but wondered why I have numberous smaller cyst around a 2cm cyst. I have one at 9 o'clock in one breast with as the report states numberous smaller cysts adjacent to it. Where the heck is 9 o'clock . the other breast has a 2 cm spot at the 10 o'clock location. i see a surgeon next week and they said he may drain them. I also have nasty greenish gray discharge from my right breast. I just wondered why I would have a bunch a smaller cysts around that larger one?? But I am really trying to find out where they are. When they did the u/s on the left one they kept going around the outer part toward the top. I thought that would be 1 or 2 o'clock but it says 9 o'clock on the report. Now I am really confused and wonder if I really should see a surgeon or not. I already am having a cystoscopy for blood in my urine next week. And I have an enlarged ovary too they are watching.",

      "Content": "Thanks I have decided not to worry about the fibrocystic or the papilloma since it will not become cancer. I have also decided that given everything that happened I will not do another mammogram or ultrasound. My doc is trying to change my mind but she is not the one who has to go thru the mammogram. She isn't even near 40 yet so i would like to know what she thinks of them after she gets her first one.",

      "Content": "Well , I had posted on this site before about green nipple discharge. I had a mammogram for the first time only cause the gyn pushed me to get one. I had nasty looking green discharge she noticed while I was there for a check up. Any way the one leaking was the right one , but the mammogram showed a cyst in the left one. I had the ultrasound to be sure it was truly a cyst and it was was. then the hospital screwed up the report saying I had one in both breasts. So they send me to a surgeon , why I don't understand. He could not find a cyst in the right breast and said the discharge which he would not even look at must be caused by a ruptured cyst. After the hospital fixed the typo and said there was only a cyst in the left one , I called his office and told them about the discharge being there still along with a knife-like sharp pain. They said just to wait until my recheck in a few months. So since it was really hurting I went to another doc about it. He said I have fibrocystic breast disease. He also said my pain near my areola is papillomitis or papilloma. I just wonder why the other doc never noticed the papilloma and the fibrocystic breast. the mammogram report said prominent fibroglandular breasts. Is that what that means -- fibrocystic ??? And he tried to pop what he thought was a cyst on the duct. Now the pain seems worse. Is that normal , I wonder if i should call back and ask??",

      "Content": "I noticed a bloody discharge from one breast a couple weeks ago. I had just had a mamogam about 5 months ago and it was fine. A while ago I had green discharge and had a cyst drained from the other one , and the doc said he thought I have papillomitis. This time my areola is cracking and scaling and it hurts under it. I had an ultrasound and it looked good they said next it would be a ductogram if it keeps bleeding. the raidiologist came in after the u/s and said that bleeding is a worry and that it can be a tumor or cancer. He says I have to be bleeding right then when they do the ductogram for it to work , because they have to know which duct the blood is coming from. The problem is it does not bleed all the time , it stopped for a few days and started again , but it is just spots not pouring. Anyone else have this happen ?",

I had a normal mammogram and ultrasound. they said if it keeps up I need a ductogram , but it has to be bleeding when they try to put the dye in or they won't know which duct to put the catheter in. So , I have just been putting up with it. The doc told me about a year ago when i had a cyst drained , that I have papilloma , which is noncancerous growths in the ducts , he said they can be removed if they cause pain. I have a feeling thats what is causing my bleeding , but felt better after hearing the ultrasound and mammogram didn't show anything. Please let us know how it goes for you.",

      "Content": "Well I went for the dreaded mammogram today. It was supposed to be to find out why I have green discharge from the right nipple. I was really dreading it and when she said she had to have them looked at to wait before I got dressed , I thought they will not see anything on them. So I went ahead and got my shirt back on ASAP. Then she comes back in and says they see something on your left breast not on the right one. I was like I only did this because of the right breast discharge. I ended up having to have an ultrasound on the left one. They said it is a 2.5 cm cyst , I guess that is really good news. But it didn't help when it comes to the other one that was leaking. Wonder what if anything will be done now??",

I was confused between fibroglandular and fibrocystic when I read my report. I am still confused by the difference , did your doc explain the condition very well or not??",
