    "Content": "I got bit by a mosquito on my back,it made a node near my arm pit swell. It graudally went away. I think it was swollen pretty good the first week and then the second week progressively got smaller. It is true you can't always figure out why a node swells. I don't think I'd be alarmed at this point. Keeping an eye on it is probably the best thing right now. I don't think your doctor wants to put you through a biopsy when you probably don't need one. These things happen, your body is reacting to something to protect you.",
