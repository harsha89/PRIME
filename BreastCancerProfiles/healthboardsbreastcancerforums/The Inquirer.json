Unfortunately, I'm really not crazy about this surgeon, but I guess I shouldn't care about her lack of bedside manner as long as she's good. I'm just hoping to walk out of there with my lung intact. Anyway, thanks again....Hope you are both well now. Inq",

      "Content": "Hi All, I am very thin and very flat-chested. I am scheduled to have a core biopsy in two weeks. I am not exactly thrilled at the thought of having a spring-loaded needle that close to my lung. Is there anyone else out there who is/has been in this position and could share their experience? Many thanks, Inq",
