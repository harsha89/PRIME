    "Content": "Taxol has a little side effect called peripheral neuropathy. And this is what you have if it is progressive it will go to your hands. the burning will be accompanied with extremem amounts of pain. I have been on percocet and neurondin for 8 months now. now i have carpal tunnel also from chemo. and will have to have more surgery. there is nothing they can do for neuropathy but pain management. have your doctor send you to a neurologist for a emg. to confirm the diagnosis. I no longer have any feeling in my finger tips. and my hands hurt all the time. hopefully yours will not get this bad",
