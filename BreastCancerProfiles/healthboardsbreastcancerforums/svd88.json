      "Content": "I had a mammogram about a month ago, it came back with 2 areas of concern, I had the 2nd mammogram and ultrasound, same thing, I had an apt. yesterday with a surgeon and I'm having a stereotactic biopsy in a week, then another 2-3 days wait for results. The waiting is the hardest thing, I can't concentrate at all and am exhausted from trying to be brave. I'm 48 yrs. old and have no breast cancer history in my family, so I know I have that on my side, its just the not knowing for sure. I'm scared...... Any advice from someone thats been there?",
