      "Content": "At the beginning of the summer I started having milky discharge from both breasts. I had a prolactin level ran and it was a high normal number. So I dealt with this for a few months until finally going to OB. She did a breast exam by hand and felt nothing irregular. Milk was coming from both breasts and more than one duct. I hadn't nursed in 1.5 years so she felt I'm just slightly out of the window for nursing moms to stop lactating. Plus I had the test reran and my number dropped 6 points. However, the very next month, prior to my period my arm fell asleep for over an hour. Then my armpit started hurting. Then next day it swelled and I found a lymph node the size of a pea. Then I got my period. The next day the pain moved over to above my breast right where your brastrap would fall. Then I ended up with two small peas that hurt in that area. The next day I got two peas above the other breast too. These didn't hurt as much. We'll we're one month later now. My period is due in one day. And wouldn't you know my arm is starting to tingle and hurt again. What's going on? I did see my family doc and he doesn't feel it's a problem. He said it's normal for women to get swollen glands during period. I've never heard of this. What's going on? Is this a sign of breast cancer? If it was cancer would the nodes come and go or would they just stay? Any advice is highly welcomed and so appreciated. I'm going crazy sitting here scouring the net for info. Please help!!",

      "Content": "Thank you, Leea. You're right. I just got home from my surgeon appt. I switched networks and am now being seen by a breast health center rather than getting my stuff done at the local hospital. Surgeon believes it is just breast tissue!! He is sending me for an MRI though because of the whole mess with my tests and that radiologist. He wants his own stuff done right. Plus with my family history he'll feel better about comparison pics down the road. I'm so glad you are doing well and that you are here to help others. We appreciate it so much!",

      "Content": "I don't have much of the breast pain, but I get slightly swollen glands above my breast, along the brastrap line and in my armpit. When it hurts bad it goes into my arm, mostly bicep area. It's cyclical appearing 7 - 10 days prior to my period. My family dr says it's no big deal. But I worry. My dad's sister had breast cancer last year. I'm only in my early 30's so they won't do a mammo until age 35. I see my OB in Feb so I'll def. ask a TON of questions there.",

      "Content": "Just picked up my reports. The ones where what the radiologist tells me and then tells my OB conflict. Anyway it states: no solid or cystic mass in the region. Is that a good thing? Isn't cancer a solid? Also says: scattered fribroglandular densitites noted. No change in asymmetric density or subcentimenter nodule at the spot since 2005. There is a focal asymmetric density in the upper right. I have been a mess since all of this occured so any good news to me is huge. What do you think? I meet with the surgeon this week and want to ask all the right questions. Thanks so much!!",
