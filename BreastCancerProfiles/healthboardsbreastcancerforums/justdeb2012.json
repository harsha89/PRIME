Got a copy of my pet scan report. impression: 9mm lymph node is noted in the left axilla which demonstrates a mildly avid uptake of FDG with suv max 2.2 which suggests mild reactive adenitis. two small residual 5 m left supraclavicular lymph nodes demonstrating mild avid updake of FDG, SUV max 2.6. These also suggest residual reactive adenitis. OTHERWISE NEGATIVE PET SCAN. NO EVIDENCE OF DISTANT METASTASES,",

      "Content": "I read as many posts as possible before posting my question. I was so impressed by your responses to eveyones questions. I was so hoping you would reply to mine. Thank you for replying to me. I just got back fro the cancer dr. He took some blood. Referred me for and MRI and a Pet scan. As for a biospy. My spinal mass is between my lungs and my spine. so a simply needle biospy can't be done. They referred me to a neurosurgeon on wednedsay to discuss him to doing a biospy. Sounds scary. Not sure what the difference is? At least thing seem to be moving fast. Again thank you for your kind words. Debi",
