    "Content": "I went for my yearly check-up last Mon. and then was scheduled for a mammogram/ultrasound because he found a mass. My report said that is a 2.5cm mass on my right breast. It is possibly a carcinoma and then at the end of the report is said its highly suggestive malignant. I am scheduled for a biopsy this Tues. morning. I am scared to death. I'm only 41. They said it would be a ultrasound guided biopsy. Has anyone had this type done before and also how long does it take before you get the results of procedure?",
