      "Content": "Hi, I've had the tip of one nipple turn white, like dry skin, irritated, can't pick it off, I tried OUCH, don't know if this is something to worry about???? I think I had one on the other breast nipple a couple of years ago and it went away, but this one feels a lkittle bigger and when I say irritated, it's like when you don't wear a bra and get that scratchy feeling. ANyone, I'd appreciate any help. I don't know if I need to see my GYN or a dermatologist or surgeon. Sigh.......",

      "Content": "I just got the report from my third routine mamo. It said that it didn't show any cancer,but that my breasts are so dense it makes it basically impossible for the mamo to show cancer, and for me to do weekly breast exams. NOW, I have totally flat chest. They TRY to find flesh to squish from my ribs, there isn't any there, under the arms, there isn't any there, so they don't get barely ANY flesh to flatten! Could this be why they call it \"dense\", because there's not much to take a picture of?? I am VERY skinny and I'm not exaggerating when I say they really can't get much in that machine, though they try. I end up all bruised on my bony ribs and chest!",

So, I didn't have the heavy bleeding and awful cramps many women have with endo, it was the diareah that helped a doctor diagnose me. Check it out with your gyn.",
