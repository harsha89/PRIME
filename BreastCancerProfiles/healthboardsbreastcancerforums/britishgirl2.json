I have to have another mammogram and an ultrasound done. I have never had an abnormal mammogram before and am really worried about this.......anyone give me any info here?",

      "Content": "Update: I had my 2nd Mammogram/spot compression done along with an ultrasound - I just got the report today which states \"your recent breast exam showed an area that we believe is benign (not cancer). However, in 6 months, you should have a follow-up to confirm that this area has not changed\". What exactly does that mean? I hate having to read between the lines on these reports.",
