      "Content": "lung lesion~should I be worried! I am a breast cancer survivor...2 years out of triple neg. I had a double mastectomy and 4 rounds of chemo. Recently a 1.8cm non calcified lesion was found on my lung. A year ago it was below a cm in size, but I wasn't told about it by my oncologist. It wasn't until this fall when another doc found it and noticed that the follow up testing had not been done, because I wasn't told. It has obviously grown some, my oncologist is not concerned. My other doc is very concerned and said I should have a follow up CAT every 4 months. A pET scan in Nov. did not show any cancer. Should I be worried??? I have, in the mean time changed cancer docs but have not seen the new one yet. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",
