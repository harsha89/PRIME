Hi, ive been getting pains in both my breasts but mainly my left, i do have a lump in my left but had a biopsy two and half years ago and it was just a fibrodenoma,benign anyway. I had one shot of the depo in july last year and havent had a proper period yet so im telling myself its that as im not pregnant either but im also having pains in my left side its not realy painful just annoying, has any one else having anything similar",

      "Content": "Hi, i sent a message about my left breast hurting more than my right and that i wasnt pregnant so i put it down to having the depo injection last year, well im finaly having a proper period now and my breasts dont seem to hurt half as much. Although the depo suited me and it was great to not have a period but when you come of it its an absolute awfull experience.Im still getting the annoying slight pain in my side and under my left breast but that hasnt been as bad either,the doc checked my breasts two days ago and didnt find any other lumps apart from the one ive got so that was a relief but its very scary when you just cant understand why you get these pains and when you finaly start bleeding the pain gradualy stops, im actualy happy to on my PROPER period! karen.",
