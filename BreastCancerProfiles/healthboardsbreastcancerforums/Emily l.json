    "Content": "Hi, I have suffered from health anxiety since the age of 14 (I am now 20) I often worry on and off that I have some sort of breast cancer. I get white discharge from my nipples and when I am cold they may go red/purple. Even though my gp said this was normal, I often become extremely worried. I am now very very scared and I am about to move away from my family to France. Please help to reassure me/give me advice. Thanks so much Emily",
