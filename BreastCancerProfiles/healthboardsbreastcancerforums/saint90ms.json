      "Content": "Hi everyone... I am 38 and had a hysterectomy 4 1/2 years ago. Ive been on 1 mg. of estradiol ever since. Today I had my third routine yearly mammogram. I received a call back just a while ago saying that I need to go back tomorrow for a retake of my RIGHT breast. She said that the breast tissue is very dense and appears very white on the image. However, tumors also appear the same color and the radiologist felt it needs to be relooked at. I am very worried because my last two mammograms were fine. The previous report says that the \"breast parenchyma is heterogeneously dense\". Not sure if that was for both sides or one. It didn't say. Also, there were several scattered benign appearing calcifications in the left breast a year ago. Anyone else had something similar happen. I am very worried because I was on high doses of hormones back in the last 90's trying to get pregnant through fertility treatments (about 8 years worth). I appreciate your input and helping me understand some of this. Thanks",

      "Content": "Thanks for the reply. I'll give my doctor a call after Thanksgiving. Are you familiar with \"Intrammamary Lymph nodes\"? I do not know much about them and not sure about what the normal size of the lymph node SHOULD be. Mine is 6mm. I wish I knew a little more about this and how common it is to find them on a mammogram.",

      "Content": "I just recently had a mammogram done....I am 40. They had to call me back to re-do the test because there was something that looked suspicious. It turned out to be a \"probable\" 6mm intramammary lymph in the upper outer quadrant of my right breast. The report said \"probably\" and that work kind of worries me. They told me to come back in a year. Wouldn't an ultrasound also be recommended since the report didn't sound 100% sure? I'm a little worried and confused. Please provide some information if anyone is familiar with this. Thans",

      "Content": "Just to be on the safe side, I would have your doctor check you out and do a complete breast exam. You never want to take a chance, especially if your feeling uneasy about things. You should always listen to your gut. If you've never had a differential size in your breasts prior to this, then it's a good idea for your doc to examine you. Have you done a self exam? Have you noticed any subtle changes, etc. GOod luck.",

      "Content": "Hello everyone. I'm looking for some input and hoping that this site will be helpful to me. I received my mammogram/ultrasound report and I am being sent for a biopsy next week. I have had a number of cysts watched over the last year with a six month FU in between. Here's the report. Mammary parenchyma contains scattered fibroglandular elements, approx 25-50% glandular. Masses are present in the upper outer quadrant bilaterlly. They are more apparent than previously seen six months ago and are iso-attenuating (WhAT DOES THAT MEAN?) to the breast parenchyma. US Report Right dominant simple cyst measuring 1.4 cm and has increased from 1.3cm. This is at the 11:00 radian. Also at the same spot is an iso-echoic nodule measuring 7mm. At the 10:00 radian, a hypo-echoic lesion measuring 8mm, originally was 4mm a year ago, then 6mm six months ago and presently 8mm presently. Internal material is more apparent than previously. Ultrasound-guided aspiration recommended. Left has several complicated cysts, or small fibro-adenomas. Ranging in size from 3mm to 6mm. In addition, a complicated cyst measuring up to 7mm is present. These are probably benign. Six month follow-up recommended as this is the first time patient has had findings in left breast. WHAT DOES ISO-ECHOIC AND HYPO-ECHOIC MEAN? ASLO WHAT DOES ISO-ATTENTUATING MEAN? I am nervous but I have to be patient. I am 43 years old otherwise healthy with no family history. thank you",
