I am going to be starting chemo soon, than radiation after. I am still recovering from the surgery. Just a lot of numbness and pain on my left side where my lymph nodes were removed. Still cant believe I am going through this but I have a positive attitude. Keep in touch if you are able to. Thanks, JoJo",

She said it's like when you have a cold and the lymph nodes in your neck swells. That's just like under your arm. I really never heard that your lumph nodes under your arm can swell (causing a lump) from shaving. Anyone heard of that? I never had any problems before. I just hope this lump goes away. Bernice",

      "Content": "Hi Sydney, How are you doing? After my expander surgery it looked liked I had really small breasts. They were a little odd shaped. Felt like it went over towards my arm pit. My doctor put in I believe 150CC's during surgery. But it was nice to finally feel like I had breasts. They felt like rocks. Didnt move. I never wore a bra during the expansion. Just tank tops under my clothes, Bras didnt fit right. The permanent implant doesnt feel anything like the expander. I went with silicone which is a more natural feeling. I was expanded in a month. 5 times at 60'ccs each time. Once 1 week, then twice a week for the next 2 weeks. That was a total of 450 cc's with the initial 150 cc's. I had radiation starting on October 17 so had to be done with expanding. I got to expand one more time after radiation ended just 25 cc's on each side. That was a total of 475cc's. My implants are 450cc's. It was uncomfortable sleeping at night. I used pillows to sit up at night. I also took pain pills after the expansion just for 1-2 days. You do get use to it after awhile. They felt like they were in the way because they didnt move. And the pain does not last after a couple of days. Any questions please ask, Good luck, let me know how you do. JoJo",

I had the double mast in April 07, and didn't have my expanders put in until Sept 07, because of a timing issue. When I woke up from the expander surgery I was in a lot of pain. The expander went under the muscle and he expanded me a little during surgery. Not sure if the pain was so bad because it had been 5 months since the mast surgery and the expanders really had to stretch my skin. I went for about I think 6 fills. The fill itself doesnt hurt. But the more I got the more I had pain after, which lasted a couple of days. I had to be filled very quickly because of radiation starting. So I only had about 6 weeks to get filled. The expanders are very hard and uncomfortable. Use to sleep on my back sitting up a little. On January 26 I had the expanders out and went with silicone implants. It feels so much better now. I wish you all the luck. Take Care, JoJo",

It was nice. You do have to empty them and keep track. You will probably have them in a few days to a week maybe. It feels so much better after they come out. I would say the pain came from the muscle stretching. Every time they expand you they are making a pocket big enough for the implant to go into. The sleeping issue was just from the pain the first couple of days, then it was just hard to get comfortable because they were so hard. Just prop yourself up with a couple of pillows behind you. I was able to sleep on my side after awhile. I mainly slept on my back at first. I wish you luck, do you have to have chemo or radiation? My prayers are with you, keep me posted. JoJo",

I was scheduled for my mamo at end of April and made my doctor move it up to March. Found out I had breast cancer in my left breast. Had a bilateral mast on April 12. The cancer had spread to 4 of the left nodes under my left arm pit. Yours hopefully in absolutely nothing. THey say 80% of lumps are benign. I would just push for a mamo, mri and biopsy if needed.

He did mention something about hernias. I love to work out, do not like hearing cant lift much weight. Oh well, too much to think about right now. I have to get through the chemo and radiation. It is 4 am I cannot sleep. Have not taken a zanax for 2 nights because wanting to try to wean off them. Have gone back to some pain pills at night because of the constant throb on my left armpit and arm area. Still have a lot of numbness. No relief. Will be 2 weeks tomorrow that bilateral mast was done. Everything else feels great. It is just where the lymph nodes were removed. Going to meet a physical therapist for this arm tomorrow.

I love them so much and I am enjoying it. It is a lot of work, as everyone knows. CJ, thanks for the info on the implants, that is what I think I want to do, I had one doctor tell me I had to wait to after radiation, then the radiation doctor told be she wants my expanders put in before radiation. So I think they need to talk and figure this out. The surgeon did leave some skin there, I was probably a big B before the surgery. Linda how long were you on Xanax for? It has only been about a month for me and I didnt take it Sat or Sun night and I was up all night, But I did take my pain pills both nights so I dont know if it is from that or not. My arm is just so bad, so sensitive to touch, numb, throbbing, I have been using ice, It will be 2 weeks tomorrow so I know I have to be patient. Just didnt expect all this pain in the arm area. The rest of the surgery feels ok. Is it hard to get off the xanax? I just figured one less pill, but if I have to take it I will. It does work good. What kinds of nuts and seeds do you guys eat for protein. Will be starting chemo in probably 2 weeks, I want to eat as healthy as I can. You guys are the experts. I wish everyone a joyful night. I am going to try to get some sleep. I am so blessed to have come across this site and able to speak with all you guys. It makes me feel better, I know it will be a long road this summer. But I am going to stay strong. Take Care, JoJo",

Have to take decadron tonight twice sat and twice sun. My stomach is very upset. I think it is from the nausea pills. I also got the shot Neulasta before I left. I have a lot of burbing and very upset stomach, took some tums but they dont work. Someone suggested zantac but I have to check with the doctor. Had some soup and saltines tonight that is all I could stand. Talk to you later. JoJo",

Did not have the neulasta shot this time. Didn't know about the glutamine I will have to ask about it. What do you mix it with water, juice?? Tylersnana that is awesome you have not had any problems yet. Hopefully you wont. You didnt get any bone pain a few days after treatment? They said if I did it probably would be on day 3. So I will just have to wait. Do you have any problems with the A/C? Thanks for the info. JoJo",

I was in and out in about 4.5 hours. It is a relief to get the expanders out. I had two drains for 5 days. I can sleep on my side now. Not on my stomach though. Every thing came out great and I am happy. Feeling really good now. I am going to go back for the nipple and tattoo. Keep me posted on how you make out. When are you going in for surgery> Take Care, JoJo",

      "Content": "Hi Cross, I also had a bilateral mast and had tissue expanders put it. I had mine filled to 475 cc's on both sides. I also had the same problem as you, every time I told him I wanted to be a C, he said everyone is different, we dont go by cup size. He said my fills were done at I think 390cc's and I asked for more. I was expanded once more 60 cc's and then again at 25 cc's, only because I pushed the issue. The expanders were only a certain size and I was over expanded. I just had my silicone implants put in 3 weeks ago. He ordered 450 cc's and 500 cc's. He went with the 450's the 500's would not fit. I have to wear wireless bras for right now. I got a few 34C bras and they fit good. So I would say I am a good C. How many fills have you had and do you know what number you are at? Bras dont fit right when you have the expanders in. The implant is so much different in shape and way more comfortable. Do you know what type you are going with. I know they say everybody is different depends on your body. I had no breast tissue left so 450 is a good size but not to big. Take care and good luck. JoJo",
