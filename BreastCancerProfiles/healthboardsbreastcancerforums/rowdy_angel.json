    "Content": "Hypokelly, I'm having my abdominal ultrasound on Tuesday and I too am very very worried about the possibility of it being cancer. Like you, I am pre-menopausal (33). I went to see my doctor last week and he felt a mass in my abdomen. I went to see him because I suspcted IBS and even he said it was IBS until he felt my tummy - symptoms are the same. I'm also awaiting blood test results. I'm dreading the ultrasound as I've never had one before. I'm dreading the results even more. Can they tell you straight away what they find or does it have to go to your doctor? Rowdy_Angel",
