I looked up my symptoms to see what could be causing this, and paget's disease came up. though it said its rare. and more rare in people under the age of 50. im 17 and having the peeling cracking. I'm worried because nothing is helping. Im not sure if it could be something serious. however maybe some one where could give me some advice. please!",
