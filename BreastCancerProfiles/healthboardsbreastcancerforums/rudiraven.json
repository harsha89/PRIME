      "Content": "Shirley, No one can make the decision for you. It's up to you to decide what you think is best. If it were me, I'd opt to wait (Dr. b suggestion) and do another mammogram in 3 months. Sometimes Drs. are too anxious to cut and mess with things and make it worse, but ultimately it's up to you. Decide your risk factors, anyone in the family have breast cancer, age giving birth, start of period, taking birth control, etc. and do what you feel the most comfortable with. God bless.",

They suggest every 10 years but it's not written in stone. If you receive a serious injury they will give you a tetanus shot anyway so I wouldn't bother with it. Take care",
