      "Content": "Thank you for the responses....I just wanted to give an update. I went to the doctor on Monday and he has contacted the hospital to arrange for some tests. Next week on Thursday I am scheduled for a Biopsy/Ultrasound. I guess they are going to do the ultrasound as they are doing the biopsy. I am very nervous...I know that the chances of it being Cancer are small compared to the chances of it being something else. But that doesn't make it any less scary. To answer your question Newfie11, it's located right at the top of the breast. Almost to the end of the fleshy part of the breast. And it toward my armpit for then toward the middle. However the pain does extend into my chest towards my heart and down through the breast. The pain is what worries me and seemed to be a concern of the doctor. Hopefully it isn't too serious and I can have it removed.",

      "Content": "I just needed to write my story somewhere and get it off my chest. I've very stressed out about all of this. Around 4 years ago I found a lump near the top of my right breast. Almost sort of above it. I immediatly went to the doctor, who examined me and set me for an ultrasound. They found nothing to worry about and said that if it was annoying, we could remove it for cosmetic reasons. I said no, because the lump was so small it didn't show on the surface, didn't hurt or bother me at all. Here we are, 4 years later. The lump has almost doubled in size and hurts! The whole area hurts and the lump is very painful when you touch it. Not to mention about a year ago I developed another hard lump on my upper back (I know, unreleated, but I had to mention it) I'm going in on Monday to speak with the doctor about it. It's just one of those situations where I kick myself for not having it removed in the past.",

      "Content": "Hi there, I was hoping someone could let me know what to expect during a biopsy. I've had a lot of procedures done in my life, but this one is extremely new to me. When I spoke to the nurse who called, it sounds as if they are going to do a Incisional biopsy and take a small part of the lump. They are also going to do an ultrasound at the same time as the biopsy. She told me she was pretty sure I would be under a local anesthesia during the process. For those of you who have experienced this can you tell me what to expect? And what to expect afterwards?",
