    "Content": "Hi all, I am new to this board. About two months ago, I devoped a little sore on my left breast. Its about the size of a pencil eraser, maybe a little smaller. I think how it started is that I had a hair there (gross, I know!) and tried to pluck it and it looked like it turned into an ingrown hair. Since then it hasn't gone away, its kinda red and has a slight bump if you touch it. I showed it to my primary doctor and she said it was a little cyst, nothing to worry about. This was last week. Since then, I've some random itchyness on both breasts. Not just on the nipple or aerola, but kinda everywhere. Almost like I have an itchy sweater on, that kind of annoying little itch. It is not constant. I also sometimes have a tiny pain - again in both breasts. I've read about Pagets and that has me scared. If I had that, would both breasts be itchy? The sore I have is about half an inch outside of the aerola area. I am 36 years old. My mom just passed away from uterine cancer, so I am petrified of cancer now. I also changed laundry detergent recently and am curious if maybe that is causing it? I dont feel itchy anywhere else, tho. I do have very sensitive, dry skin. I have an appointment with my Ob/gyn in February. I am just really nervous - any advice? Thank you, Carrie",
