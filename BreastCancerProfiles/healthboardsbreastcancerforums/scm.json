    "Content": "Hi everyone, I have a question about the diagnosis of bone mets. My mom has been cancer free for 5 years and has recently been experiencing some pain in her hip -- what she thought was bercitis. The pain came on fast and is not constant, and is aggravated by exercise (it comes and goes and is more of a sharp pain than a dull ache). She had a pet scan done as follow-up for a separate issue and it showed a spot on the hip with an SUV of 2.5. The preliminary written report said this was not something to worry about since it was a dim reading but since she is symptomatic, I imagine her onc will want her to have more testing (MRI, bone scan). Can anyone shed any light on pet scans and if they are helpful in this arena? One thing she was told is that this spot is on the iliac bone, and is not in the joints where bercitis or arthritis would be. Could the spot on the bone be caused by something other than cancer? If it is cancer, wouldn't it have been \"hotter\" on the scan? Any help/advice/experience would be greatly appreciated and thanks in advance for your help. scm",
