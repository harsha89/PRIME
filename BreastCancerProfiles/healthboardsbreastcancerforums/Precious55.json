    "Content": "Hi everyone, I've been having pain in my right breast for almost 2 weeks, especially when I take a deep breath. I also have some swelling under my same armpit. I've had that for a couple of months. I went to my Dr. Friday, and he examined me. I nearly came off the table when he was pressing certain areas of the breast. He had X-rays done of that side because of the breathing and is scheduling me for a diagnostic mammogram. That way if they have to do an ultra sound they can do it based on what they find.I'm 58 years old and have been through menopause. My mother died of breast cancer when she was 61, so I'm a little nervous as to what this might be.",
