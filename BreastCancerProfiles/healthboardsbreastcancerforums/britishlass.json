      "Content": "Wow, Im sorry you are going through all this, you obviously have had a very full plate, but Sharon is right, you have so much to celebrate too. Have a wonderful wedding. You can take care of the rest after! I have also found out I have two lumps, not one, so mastectomy for me too, I meet with the Plastic Surgeon wednesday for his options. Anyway, here is to a beautiful wedding and a new chapter in your journey!",

      "Content": "Sharon, Thank you so much! I did hear today it is ER+ PR+ HER2-. I have been very impressed with the Breast Center that is assisting me, they have been very supportive. I am a very half glass full type of person, so I fully intend to keep it that way. I will be looking for a support group for myself and hopefully for my husband, I think he is in more of a panic than I am, he lost his sister to BC. I see the surgeon on thursday, so Im thankful I dont have to wait too long for some answers. Thank you again for your wonderful reply.",

      "Content": "Just an update, I got the results of the MRI ordered by the surgeon, I do have two lumps in the left breast, but all clear in the right, so he is recommending mastectomy instead of Lumpectomy. Weird thing is, im kind of relieved I dont have to make the decision between the two. I have an appointment wednesday with the Plastic Surgeon regarding reconstruction, there are so many options out there, anyone have an opinion on which is better? Typically, what is the down time for all of this? My other question Im kind of confused on, is chemo a given, or is it based on other factors I dont know about until after the mastectomy? Thanks everyone.",

      "Content": "Im still in a fog, got my partial results today, I have invasive ductal carcinoma. Two areas in my left breast, dont have the receptors yet. Im in a bit of shock, have hashimotos with thyroid nodule, thought if I was going to get cancer it would be there, not on my breast. Sorry, still not quite got my head wrapped around this yet. My question is, where do you go from here? Im being referrered to a general surgeon for all of my results and options, should I be seeing another type of specialist. Thanks for any advice.",
