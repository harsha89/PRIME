      "Content": "I have been having breast pain (right breast) quite a bit lately. I had ultrasound done about 2 years ago on that breast and they found nothing. My doctor thought that it was cystic fibrous, and that it was nothing to worry about. I am not sure if the pain just comes before my period or not. I felt around for any lumps, I feel some, but from what I am told, women do have lumps in there breast. I recently went throught some major health problems, and I am not sure if I am paronoid. Any suggestions or info???",
