      "Content": "Hi there, I was diagnosed with Stage 1 breast cancer two months ago, had a lumpectomy 5 weeks ago. My oncologist told me I should take a three month round of chemo (taxotere and cytoxan) as a precaution to kill any micro cancer cells that could be there. I'm afraid to take the chemo because of the side effects but I'm afraid not to take it for fear the cancer will come back. Can someone please tell me how these chemo drugs worked on them? Thanks so much.",

      "Content": "Hi CJ - Thanks so much for your response. I've been on the web doing lots of research and decided that I want a PET scan before I decide on the chemo. I want to make sure the cancer has not spread. I was so happy to hear that you made it thru the chemo without too many horrible side effects and I'm also happy for you that your are doing so well. I know there are so many happy endings now with bc, we've come a long way. I will keep you posted on my progress. Thanks again!!",
