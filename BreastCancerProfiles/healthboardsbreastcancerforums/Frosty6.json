    "Content": "Prouddad, I want to say that my heart and prayers are with you and your family. I am usually on the back board, but my mother just had biopsies on her breast so I came here to see if I can find any information similar to hers. So far, yours was the closest. We won't know anything until tomorrow or Tuesday but are praying for the best. I want to salute you for being there for your wife and reaching out to others during this difficult time. Far too often, our spouses don't really understand the need to have you understand and be by our sides. You are a blessing to her and an inspiration to so many here. God Bless, Lisa",
