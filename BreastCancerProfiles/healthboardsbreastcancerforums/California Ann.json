      "Content": "Hi, I just went through chemo 7 months ago. I was very lucky and didn't have many side effects. My chemo team was the best I was ready for almost anything. My first round was the worst and it wasn't bad. I had no problems while I was having my therapy. My treatments were on Mondays and I had to go back on Tuesdays for a Nulesta injecton. I was fine until Wednesday evening. I got tired and slept for 3 day. The only time I got up was because I had diahreah pretty bad. But when I remembered to take something to stop it I was fine. My Dr put me on steroids to take with my chemo and I didn't have any other problems like that. I did get a little tired and food didn't taste very good. But do you think I could have lost a pound or two. No such luck. I had my first treatment on June 13 and most of my hair was gone by the first week of July. It is April 21 and I have already had to have 2 haircuts and am ready for another. I love my new short hair. I think the loosing my hair was the hardest for me. I was prepared though but I still wasn't ready. My daughter and I went wig shopping before I even lost my hair. She is a hair dresser so we went to a wig shop and made a day of it. It was fun but it took me a while before I could talk about loosing my hair without crying. I tried to be prepared for most anything. I started using special toothpaste and mouthwash without alcohol, took snacks to my treatments drank lots of fluids. Kept lots of sugarless candies around and I rested when I needed it. My Dr made sure I had anything I needed before I needed it. I think it is just as important to have drs with a good attitude as it is for you to have a good attitude. You can do it!! My side effects were minimal and I know I was very lucky. Read everything you can get your hands and talk to everyone you can. You have to try to be as prepared as possible and expect the unexpected. My grand kids helped me alot. They would come over and we would walk to the park and the library. Let your family help you. It is a good therapy for them too. Good luck and God Bless, Ann",
