    "Content": "I will try to make a very long story shorter. I am 24, My aunt was diagnosed with breast cancer back in 2001 at 38. For the last four years her cancer has spread to her tailbone,(controled w/ chemo) brain,(shrunk w/ radiation) uterus,(had it taken out) back to her brain,(uncontrollable for some reason) She has been such a fighter this whole time. But with the cancer back in her brain, it is affecting her in so many ways. She is now at the point where she can't even stand up by herself, a majority of the time when I talk to her, its just not her, you have to look at her when your talking or she doesn't know you talking, etc. Its just like she's loosing her mind? We are a family of hope, and none of us have given up, especially her husband, he is the type of guy anyone would want in their corner. She is currently taking an experimental medicine, that they say is chemotherapy in pill form, that will reach throught he blood brain barrier..my question..without sounding too optimistic, does anyone know of anyone who has managed to get brain mets under control?? I have not given up hope, its just hard sometimes, when we're so used to hearing bad news, and then hearing good news, we haven't heard any good in a while.",
