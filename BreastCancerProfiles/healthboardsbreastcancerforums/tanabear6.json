    "Content": "Hi...I'm new to this particlar board...a couple of days ago, my bf noticed a small bump on my areola. I brushed it off, I thought it was just the way its always been...but today I was feeling around, and theres a pea sized lump under the skin. Its hard to the touch, not squishy at all. I'm 22, don't smoke, am on birth control...is it possible that this could be anything serious? i'm not letting myself stress out until I get it checked out, but realistically, does this sound like cancer? I don't know much about breast cancer...but this is odd.",
