    "Content": "Hi about a year ago this small black dot would appear on top of my left nipple...usually when I showered or applied cream on my breasts. I thought it was just lint or something so I tried to pick it off but it just went back inside my nipple. Finally just about 2 weeks ago...I broke a bobby pin in half and picked it off. I couldnt even take it off with tweezers before. I saw my doctor and she said it was probably sort of cyst but nothing to worry about. and she just sorta laughed at me and told me everything was fine cause i was really worried about it. but i still dont know...has anyone else had this problem? is it something serious??",
