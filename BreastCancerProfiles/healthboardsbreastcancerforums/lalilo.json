    "Content": "Every so often...perhaps once a week I experience a very uncomfortable burning sensation on my left breast and nipple in the same general area of the breast. It is quite uncomfortable but only lasts approximately 5 to 10 minutes. I have checked the breast when that occurs and there is not any outward signs of something wrong....the breast appears normal all the while it feels like someone has poured boiling water on the affected area. This has been occuring on and off for approximately 4 years. Anybody have any ideas or suggestions? Would greatly appreciate some imput. Thanks, Kathryn",
