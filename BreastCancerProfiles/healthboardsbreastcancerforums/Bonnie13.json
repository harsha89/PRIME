      "Content": "I am 49 and I also was diagnosed with DCIS. I had the lumpectomy in December which wasn't enough and a mastectomy in January with the tram flam reconstruction. I'm glad I got the mastectomy but if I could do it again, I would pass on the tram flam reconstruction. I did not have radiation and my doctor advised against tamoxifen. He said the side effects outweigh the benefits. Any thoughts out there on the benefits/ side effects of tamoxifen?",

      "Content": "Suggi Thanks for your replies. My lymph nodes were clear. I will check on how big my margins were. Re the tamoxifen, my family doctor advised that she would go on it if she were me. She thinks the younger you are, the more aggressively you should try to prevent possible cancer. If the cancer ever came to the other breast I'd always regret not taking the tamoxifen. If you had cancer in one breast, the chances of getting it in the other goes up 1% each year. I'm still on the fence. Bonnie",
