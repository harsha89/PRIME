    "Content": "I have just completed the 10 SAVI radiation treatments. It is only given to women who have had a lumpectomy with clear margins and no lymph nodes involved. Your radiologist will determine if you are candiate. You will have two treatments each day which last about 5 minutes each, but plan on being in the office 40 minutes. After your surgeon has implanted the device inside your breast (using ultrasound to position), then the radiologist attaches the 6 or 7 tubes from the device to the source (radiation) by long tubes. The treatment is very short, about 5 minutes. What is great about this treatment is that you spend only one week for treatment versus 1 treatment a day for 33 treatments for full breast outside radiation. I had a problem with heat at the site on the 6th treatment, but forged ahead to complete the 10 treatments. No more incidents than the one. Your radiologist takes out the SAVI device, so you don't have to go back to the suregeon. I hope this helps you.",
