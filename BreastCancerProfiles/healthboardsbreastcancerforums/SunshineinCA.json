      "Content": "Hi CarolineNC - I just wanted to give you a update. I went to the Surgeon today and she was Sooooo BUSY that she barely had time to talk with me and give me a quick exam. She had 4 patients waiting for her when I arrived and 4 more that came in while I was waiting to see her. So a total of 9 patients sitting waiting just for her! She did suggest a MRI (because I have dense breasts) and said it is better to get a MRI prior to surgery in case there are things that the Mammo is not showing. She said that way if there is another suspious area that shows up on the MRI than I would only have to have 1 surgery vs having MRI after biopsy and perhaps having to have a second surgery. That made sense. I am worried about the MRI because I am allergic to contrast dye and I metioned that to her but she did not have time to discuss that with me. She said talk to the MRI people and handed me a piece of paper. She wasn't sure that my Mother's colon cancer (My Mom was dx at 48) could increase my risk of BC - she wasn't sure if it colon cancer is linked or not to BC and not sure if that is why my Sister had an increased risk - OK she's the Surgeon - if she doesn't know then who does?? She was so busy that she did not give me a solid plan of action other than the MRI! It was just an all around disaster - didn't get to ask 8 of the 10 questions I had. So as I was in the Lobby on my way out - I called my OBGYN to get a second opinion refferal to a Breast Onc. - I am sure she would know if my risk factor for BC would increase because of my Mom's cancer! My GP and OBGYN are fantastic. They make me feel as though they care about my health and me as a individual. That was Not the case with this Surgeon - so I hoping that this next Surgeon is better! I know you are having your surgery on Friday. I will be thinking of you and hoping that you will have a quick recovery and then good news with your biopsy report! Keep me updated and I will do likewise. Warm thoughts - C",

      "Content": "Hi Caroline and Pat - I wanted to post an update. I had my surgery on Wednesday and it wasn't without complications. Looks like I have a needle puncture wound to my lung (which will heal in a couple of weeks) and my shoulder blade somehow got injured (I guess from being positioned weird during surgery) and I have extreme back pain from that. As far as the breast incision - like Caroline mentioned no pain. So I had to go to my GP 2 days after surgery for the other problems and had to go back to the hospital BUT the good news is my GP already had my pathology report in the computer and I have no cancer! I am very relieved and I will continue to always get my mammograms. I appreciate being able to come here and find some comfort during a difficult time. Thank you so much for your support and I wish you both excellent health and happiness. Christina",

      "Content": "Hi CarolineNC - How are you doing? Did you have your open excision biopsy? How did it turn out for you? Your experience sounds like the same exact situation that I am now facing. I am waiting for my referral to go the surgeon and a bit nervous about the whole thing because I just had my sister pass away from BC. I have read that when you have ADH there is a 25% chance that when you have the open excision biopsy they may find cancer-do you know if that is true? Did your surgeon mention this to you? You are a step ahead of me on this process and I would really appreciate any feedback you can give me. I hope everything turned out well for you if you already had the procedure and hope you get this post because I just joined and I am not sure how all of this works on this board! Thanks in advance for any insight you can give me and again I hope you are doing well! C",

      "Content": "Hi Sailing - Thank You so much for sharing your experience. I think you being pro-active and getting Mammograms was the key to you being able to catch this in it's earliest stage. Can I ask you if they ever recommended you have a MRI? Christina Applegate said in her interview with Oprah that the MRI is what showed her Cancer. Just wondering if you have had one or not. With this ADH diagnosis that I just received -I am trying to gather all the information that I can and want to be as pro-active as possible. I have a new scheduled appointment with a Breast Onocologist on May 3rd and I will continue to post and update on this board. I think if more women share - as you have - it does give us more insight on what we are dealing with and also the message of hope and encouragement. Thank You -",

      "Content": "Hi Caroline, Pat, and Illinoisgal- I appreciate all of you for sharing your personal experience with us. This is such a private and difficult experience to go through and being able to come here and share this information with those who are going through the same thing has brought me much comfort. Who else can better understand what we are feelings at this time? My friends listen but they really do not Know how I feel. But I am sure all of you do. I met with my new Surgeon yesterday and I really liked her! She spent an hour with me and explained the ADH and the complete start to finish about the surgery. I feel total confidence in her abilities as a Surgeon. She is a Surgical Oncologist specializing in Breast Cancer. I still have a couple of question for any of you who might be able to answer them. My Surgeon said she does the excisional biosy procedure under general anesthesia - is this common? I told her I was hoping to be under twilight (so as not to have the side effects of general anesthesia) but she said that is not the way she performs this surgery. The other thing that surprised me is that she said she uses a Morphine type drug called Fentanyl in the IV during surgery. I am very drug sensitive and I am more concerned over the drugs being used and the anesthesia than the actual surgery itself! (I am going to have a phone consult with the Anesthesiologist prior to surgery) So any answers or suggestions -especially about a alternative IV drug- would be so much appreciated at this time. I am again grateful for the support we can find here on this board! Warm thoughts - Christina",

      "Content": "Hi CarolineNC - Thank you so much for your response. Like I mentioned before - my situtation is very similiar to yours. I am in my 50's with a Sister that also passed away from BC. I went in for my mammogram and have 4 spots (very tiny) micro calcifications (no lumps and no visible mass) and when the core needle biopsy results came back- it turned out to be ADH . I am meeting with my Surgeon on Tuesday (April 20) - I will let you know what she says. I appreciate your positive outlook (remembering that there is a 89% chance that it won't be an invasive cancer) and I will keep that in mind as I go through this process. I think I will feel better once I meet with the surgeon - right now I do feel a bit in the dark and and scared - one minute I feel ok and the next minute I start panicking. I just have to keep telling myself that I do not want to be a prisoner to all of this! Please keep me posted -",

I can tell you that the surgery is not that bad. I had no pain at all from my excision site and I healed very well. As far as the results from the biopsy, the statistics are in your favor. That's what helped me to stay positive and I told myself to just take one step at a time. Christina Christina",

What a time to get this - I usually feel pretty healthy and Never get sore throats. Anyway my surgery is next Wednesday June 2 and I really didn't get to nervous about it until last night. I am trying to keep as busy as possible and trying not to think to deeply about it. I wil keep you posted Christina",
