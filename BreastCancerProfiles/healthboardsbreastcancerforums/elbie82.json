    "Content": "Hello! I am a healthy 27 year old female with no known history of breast cancer in my family. I have a pea sized, hard lump on the surface of my areola that feels like a smooth ball when 'pinched'. It is not painful, nor does it move. I have actually had this as long as I can remember, and vaguely remember my pediatrician mentioning it to my mom and thinking it was a cyst. I have recently had a breast exam done by Planned Parenthood (I am uninsured) and the doctor asked me how long I'd had it. When I told her that it's been there as long as I can remember, she seemed unworried and didn't mention it again. Unfortunately, I worry way too much about things and am now, for the first time in my life, trying desperately to figure out what it is without paying out of pocket for a doctor appointment. I will over course see a doctor if it's something I should worry about, but since I've had it since I was young, maybe it's nothing? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",
