      "Content": "this is about nipple discharge.... I've had it since May 2010 and it went away for a bit...then came back...then went away...then came back...etc. It never stayed for more than a few days (about 3 or 4) Well now it is back...it has been 2 weeks. It was dark yellow at first...(it is spontaneous, unilateral, uniductal).... but today there was blood in it. I am 28 years old...never been pregnant, not on any meds.... had a clean mammo and ultrasound... Have an appt on February 23rd... and I'm so completely terrified. I also have no family history of bc. What do you all think? :-(",

      "Content": "I really appreciate everyone being so positive. It is hard to be that way when it is your own body you know? My only problem...is that I have looked it up on mayo clinic and what not...but everything I've read about bloody discharge is only 2 things... papilloma or cancer....and it is steadily getting worse for me....started clear, turned yellow, now yellow with blood in it.... that can't be good!! Yeah I put myself on the cancellation list (aka if someone cancels they call me) because I'd like to be in sooner that the 23rd. But I think my mom is right...from now the 15th to the 23rd....my situation won't change much. In other words...if I have cancer...it won't get too much worse...or if I don't it won't either. I'm just concerned because now I see blood.... It feels good to hear that only about 5% of cases occur under the age of 40...and I have no known family history...so that's good....but bloody discharge is scary...(there has been no injury to my breast) more words of encouragement are much appreciated!",
