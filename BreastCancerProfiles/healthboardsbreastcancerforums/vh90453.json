      "Content": "When you said it moves around it reminded me of my niece who at 17 had quite a large lump removed from her breast. The pathology showed it to be what they call a mouse lump, I don't know the correct medical term for it, it's called that because it moves around. She was told it was harmless but she will possibly get more.",

      "Content": "It sounds to me like your breast pain is hormonal, it's normal and very common. Stress can certainly effect your period. I use to completely miss periods when I was stressed. Hormonal changes can also effect the flow. While I agree with the previous poster you should never ignore symptoms, breast cancer is very uncommon in young women especially when it's not genetic. In Australia 2% of breast cancer diagnosis are in women between 20 and 34. I think the reason young women are becoming more alert to it is because some high profile young women have had it. Best wishes.",

      "Content": "Every mammo I've had the tech has called me back to repeat one of the views. She explained they have a quick look to make sure they're clear enough for the radiologist to read accurately. They also always put me in the most painful position so they get a good picture of the lymph glands. I doubt very much a tech could read the pictures. Radiologists are highly trained to do this. I think it would have to be something very obvious, to you also, if she picked something up from a quick look. I really don't think you need worry.",
