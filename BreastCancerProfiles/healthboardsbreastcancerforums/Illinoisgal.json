      "Content": "CarolineNC: I will be sure to track how you are doing. I am sad to hear of your news. Plain and simple. Sometimes people reactions to hearing of someone else's cancer diagnosis is similar to how they react when someone has a miscarriage... they might say, \"the pregnancy wasn't meant to be, this is a blessing because something serious was wrong with the baby, you will get pregnant again if it is meant to be.\" I have already heard from a couple relatives and co-workers, \"technology is great now, at least they would be catching it early, or having BC is not a death sentence.\" How about just hearing, \"I am so sorry you have to experience this, is there anything I can do for you and your family.\" I hope that is what I hear if I end up having BC. The minimalization of a BC diagnosis doesn't sit well with me. So CarolineNC... I am saddened by your news and you are in my prayers! This is my first day on this forum... It is great to have a forum to share and feel connected.",

      "Content": "Hello special ladies: I heard back that my biopsy was essentially \"negative\" and calcifications were not cancer or DCIS. I visited my local breast surgeon to make sure my biopsy incision isn't infected and due to very bad bruising. He indicated he does not like stereotactic core biopsy for the very reason that the radiologist is going in with guidance by xray or mri for the lump or calcifications, but is blind to the location of blood vessels.. and in my case a vessel was nicked and the bleeding was profuse even later in the day. After 40 minutes of applying a lot of pressure, the bleeding finally stopped. This doctor prefers surgical excision so if needed, he can cauterize a nicked vessel or try to miss it altogether. This makes sense, but a vessel being nicked is rare, except in my case. Not complaining, I am so relieived at the good news. My local doctor wants all the xrays and reports to make sure with his own eyes that I am in the clear. Even though it was Mayo doing the tests, he wants to be sure... and that feels reassuring. You are all in my prayers. This whole experience makes me miss my mom so much, I feel like she is really with me, with us all, as we go through these trying times. I get weepy thinking about it. Yesterday morning a beautiful red finch sat on my window sill at work, and stayed for quite awhile. I think it was her hanging out, offering support...",

      "Content": "My apologies if my post appeared to be critical of anyone on this board, it is not that at all... rather that in my own situation, still not knowing the results of my own biopsy, I am already hearing that DCIS is the best kind of cancer to get if you are going to get it. While I take some comfort in knowing that this is an early stage non-invasive cancer, I am still freaked out by the utterance of cancer given what happened to my Mom at a young age. Since my post I have researched more about DCIS and if I had to pick a diagnosis, I would certainly pick that one over another type. My heart goes out to Caroline or anyone else on this board with a confirmed diagnosis or who are still in the wait and see mode, it's so hard. I am having difficulty concentrating and just want to be home with my kids. I hope to know tomorrow. Lots of prayers to everyone.",

      "Content": "I would go for the biopsy! I just came from a two day executive physical at Mayo where I had my annual mammogram (I'm 47 yrs old), and when compared to film from last two years, they found a cluster of micro-calcifications that were \"suspicious.\" They felt I could wait 6 months before having a biopsy, but with my Mom passing away from breast cancer at an early age, I decided not to mess around, and had a stereotactic biopsy (they took 11 samples), and my only complication is that later in the day the opening decided to bleed profusely and it was quite scary. I was wheeled back to the floor where the procedure was done and they pressed hard for about 40 minutes until the bleeding stopped. I should find out tomorrow or Tuesday, and I go from worrying that I will miss out on my kids futures, to hopeful and confident. I rapid cycle through both extremes every 30 minutes or so. My mom did the wait and see thing - three months of feeling something no one else could feel and did not show in her mammogram, and we all wish she had not done that.",
