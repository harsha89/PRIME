      "Content": "Did you have an ultrasound done because you found a lump yourself or they saw a suspicious area on the mammogram? I found a lump that came up really quickly this summer. In fact just a month after my routine mammogram. I get lumps every year btw. I have fibroscystic breasts. But I was alarmed and went in right away. I had an ultra sound it is was a benign cyst. This one was large enough to feel where my other ones weren't. I got an appointment with a surgeon and he drained it in his office. Painless as can be and it was gone. All this to say...every year I have to have ultrasounds because they see something unusual. And one thing I do know...it the ultra sound is show a dark black area, that is water....usually always a benign cyst. So it is a good thing if the screen is black. If it is however white...that shows more dense material. That is an area of more concern and the doctor will do more testing from there. Don't panic. They don't always tell me right then and there. I get a full report in the mail. But I have had this happen about 4 years in a row and am getting pretty good a reading the screens as they are testing. It is always frightening, but please don't panic. The surgeon I saw was so helpful and explained so much about breast tissue that I feel really educated and so much more comfortable about all my screenings. You will be ok! Let us know how things are ok!",

      "Content": "I just had a cyst removed from my left breast about 1 month ago. I get cysts all the time but this is the first on that grew to 2.5 cm and they usually drain them once they are 2.0 and larger. Mine has been there for awhile apparently because the fluid was a pale yellow color. The doctor told me that is the color when they have been there awhile. When they are new the color is a green/browny color so yours must be new. Also if you have more than one that may explain some discharge. I wouldn't be alarmed, he even told me that one lady had 15 removed in one session. 100% of all women get cysts monthly, but most dissolve back into the body. As we get older they can get clogged. Like mine did. I am just glad it's not breast cancer. I can put up with the cysts. Hang in there and let us know how it goes. It is pretty painless. I didn't even feel it being done. Just tender for a few days after. Take care!",

      "Content": "Last July 2008,almost a year ago I had a cyst in my left breast aspirated. It came up out of no where. I had a mammogram in May and in June I felt a lump the size of a decent size grape. I tried not to freak out. I told myself I have always had lumpy breasts and cyst with every mammogram each year. I think this one was there for awhile but just really grew quick in early summer. Most of the times they dissolve back into your body. Sometimes they don't and require aspiration. It's very common with women over 40. Well I guess you can be young too. Anyhow...I was lucky that mine was just a common cyst. All this to say...I have a nice long chat with the Breast surgeon who did this. He said not to worry...He did mention pain most of the time doesn't mean cancer. He said women have lumpy breasts alot. Alot of times it is fibrocystic tissue that has glands that swell monthly. That's where we get the sore tender breasts. Sometimes it's REAL painful. The one thing that has helped me get rid of my cysts is to cut out pop and coffee. The doctor told me that too. Plus I just started bioidentical hormone creams about a month ago. When my hormones where off my breasts hurt alot. I have noticed a big change in the breast tenderness thing. So far I had a pain free month. I think having pain is promising that it's not cancer. But only a doctor can diagnose that. I wanted to also say I couldn't believe how fast and painless the doctor took the fluid out of the cyst. I asked him if he was gonna start and he had already finished. He was that good!! I couldn't believe it! Hang in there ladies! It's tough being a woman ain't it?",
