Right nipple is very painful & sensitive as well. Today my left side was aching again and after I has pressed on it a few times it became much worse. The left side is definitely swollen. Of course after searching the net I am concerned of breast cancer. Even though pain is rarely a symptom I can't help but worry and think the worst. I think I am driving my self crazy with the \"What If's\" Does anyone experience this type of breat/armpit pain & tenderness? It seems some days are betyter than others. Today...not a good day Any help appreciated. Thanks..... I posted on Women's Health as well. If not allowed please let me know.",
