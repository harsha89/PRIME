    "Content": "Hi Atid, This is my first post but I truly relate to your dilemma. I found a lump on 2nd Jan and had a lumpectomy on 24th Jan. My lump was only 8mm, the margins and nodes were clear. Same decision had to be made whether to do radiation or not. The Radiation Oncologist put up a good argument as to why I should and I also know that if I didn't and it came back later I would blame myself for not having done all I could to destroy the monster that is trying to attack my body. I start Rad on 8th March. My next decision is whether to do hormone therapy. I don't have any ovaries so the hot flushes are unbearable already without adding to the problem. It's a hard call but it is one you and only you can make cause you have to live with your decision. Those that love you will still love you no matter what you decide. Koalabeach",
