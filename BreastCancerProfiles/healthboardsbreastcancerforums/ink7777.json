    "Content": "Hi, i'm sixteen and about a week ago i found a small lump in my left breast in the areola region, close to my nipple. It's hard and oval shaped, kind of like peanut m&m sized lol. it doesn't hurt but it's not going away or getting any smaller. i saw my general doctor and he gave me a referral to see a surgeon in a week. I was wondering if anyone knew what the lump could be?",
