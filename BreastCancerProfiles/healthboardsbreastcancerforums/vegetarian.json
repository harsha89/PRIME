      "Content": "hi diane. thanks for the response. i don't think a mammogram will work because the lump is above my breast. from what i gather they have to squoosh your breasts and i don't think this area would be covered. i read that the ultrasound can tell if it's a liquid filled cyst or a solid tumor yet the mayo clinic said that: It's important to note, however, that nearly all cancers can produce cysts. http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/tumor/AN00463 i would imagine the cost to cut it out would be comparable to the ultrasound. really i want it removed. i think it's better to be safe than sorry. do most doctors not recommend removal because patients don't like being cut into? i don't care and like i said, i want this thing out. anyway, thanks for responding. ps i posted that about soy because i think too much is a bad thing and i've really tried to cut back, but over the years i've consumed a lot more than the average person.",

      "Content": "thank you both for your responses. i guess i will get the ultrasound. it feels different this week... not like it shrunk (although maybe it did) but rather more like it flattened out as i've been pushing on it and fiddling with it too much. most likely it is nothing, but i'll let you know what they say. oh and i guess i should cut out all soy as i am always always tired. i could sleep 13 hrs a day if society would let me. i knew soy could make your heart race and that there were other problems linked to soy especially nonfermented and in GMO soybeans, but that is something i'll read about. never heard anything but positive things about cabbage, but all things i suppose in moderation. i'll read up on that too. thanks.",

      "Content": "hi. i am 39 years old and i found a lump above my left breast about 2 inches in from my armpit. i have never had a mammogram, ultrasound or MRI. i went to the doctor and she felt the lump and said it was movable which i guess means the skin moves over it? i thought that meant the mass itself moved around whereas this is definitely attached to something below the skin. it doesn't hurt. anyway, she said it was probably a cyst and that i should have an ultrasound. someone else told me that all an ultrasound will do is tell you something is there, but it can't say whether it's cancer or not, so i should just have them cut it out. personally, i am for surgery. it's small and i don't care if i get a scar at all. i'd rather have it removed so we know for sure what it is. i have not scheduled the ultrasound yet and i am leaning towards removing it all together. is that foolish of me? i think it's prudent, but then again maybe our health care system doesn't want us cutting out every lump we find? any advice? or more information on just exactly what an ultrasound can tell you about a lump? thanks. also i never had children and did get my period at a very early age. i was on the pill for about 5 years in my twenties and i do consume a large amount of soy. no sisters and my mother does not have breast cancer, but there were some cousins that did.",

      "Content": "well i had my ultrasound. the technicians told me it was not a cyst and they asked me to have a mammogram on the spot. i told them no, because i had to check first to make sure my insurance would cover it. regardless, i'll have more info from the radiologist tomorrow. i don't know what a mammo is going to do, so i've told my primary doctor i want it cut out and examined. i am not sure if they can tell from the ultrasound or if i would need a mammo to tell me if the surgeon should just remove the thing or to take out the surrounding tissue as well. the technicians did mention it could be lipoma and i also heard them mention something about crystals and calcium. i told them at first i just assumed it was a swollen lymph node, but then wondered because it didn't move around freely like lymph nodes do, but the skin did move across the top of it. any thoughts on this? thanks.",
