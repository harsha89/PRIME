    "Content": "I have a few sore on my left breast about an inch above the nipple it has went through many different stages in the short time I noticed it there are seven all total I don't have a lump but was concerned it might be inflammatory breast cancer since I haven't changed anything that I use at home and it just appeared out of nowhere. I have went to several different web sites and none have really helped I am seeing a doctor wed. but wanted to find out as much as I can before then someone please help It is a nasty looking thing and it hurts VERY VERY badly.The hospital I am going to is not known for being a very good one so I'd like to be informed and know the right questions to ask I am very worried because I am only 25 with a 15 month old son and would like to spend my time with him and not worring about this so much. Thanks for any info AMMBTM",
