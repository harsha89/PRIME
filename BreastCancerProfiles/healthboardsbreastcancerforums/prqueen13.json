    "Content": "I am a student on the student benefits plan so my options are limited in regards to types of doctors/equipment. Looking for thoughts/advice. I noticed that my right breast is visibly larger than my left which I know can be normal. However, there is a large hard mass close to the skin on the right side of my right breast. I would compare it to the size of an egg yolk. Next to this hard mass is about a jelly bean sized lump. I can't say there is any pain but that breast is more sensitive, I'm not sure if that is the actual breast or if it is like that because I keep touching it trying to feel it. I have a heart condition so I have been exposed to multiple chest x-rays, as well as my great maternal grandma passed on from breast cancer.",
