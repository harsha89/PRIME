      "Content": "Hi there. I have been suffering for some time with a pain wher my right breasat becomes my armpit. It feels like a bruise. Thre is nothing to seee on the skin and I cannot feel any lumps. I can feel muscle or something deep down whre the pain is, when I press. But this makes it hurt all the more. It is also worse the week before my period. I did see the doctor about this 2 years ago, but she could find nothing wrong and after about 3 months it went away. Then it came back again and went again and now back again. I therefore assume that is not cancer, as surely it would hurt all the time. Any ideas?",

      "Content": "Hi, went to the doctors this morning about it. It is bad at the moment and he felt the area (mind you I was still dressed) and hit right on the sore spot! Anyway he says that it is muscular and hormone driven, I guess this kind of makes sense. He just suggested pain killers, but I will investigate something natural I think.",
