    "Content": "It all started that I was having shooting pains and off an on itch in my left breast upper quadrant. I was so scared that it could be IBC so I went to the gyn who found a lump in the same exact area that I was complaining. He didn't seem concerned at all and said that he will send me for an ultrasound because he saw how worried I was. First ultrasound found nothing, of course I didn't stop there, second ultrasound thankfully found the lump.. On the report it states 8mm ovoid mass, Birads 3. The radiologist told me he was 99 percent sure it was a fibroidadenoma and that I should come back for a 6 month follow up to see if it grows, followed by him telling me \"which it will not grow.\" I was so relieved but then when I came home and started researching on the net about these fibroid tumors I found so many stories of women who were told they had a fibroidadenoma on an ultrasound but when biopsied it turned out to be cancer. Because of my anxiety, and not be able to sleep at night not knowing exactly for sure what this lump was I made an appointment with the breast surgeon. She sent me for a biopsy since I am over 25. I am 33 btw. So here I am today I had the lump biopsied and now waiting for the results. Anyone had a similar experience? I just need someone to talk to I am so scared... Thank you for listening to me.",
