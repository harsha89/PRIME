If it's nothing, you'll feel more at ease, mentally, and if it is something, knock on wood, you'll finally know what's wrong and go from there. GOOD LUCK!!!",

As far as I know, the whole bra/breast cancer thing is just an old wives tale. I'm 25 and I have been wearing a bra (some times overnite) since I was 10 and my breasts are fine. Check with your doctor though, it could be nothing. GOOD LUCK !!",
