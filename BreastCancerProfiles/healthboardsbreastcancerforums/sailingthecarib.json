      "Content": "Quote: Originally Posted by Carolynne57 I have been on Arimidex for 2 mos. now. This past week I have been feeling extremely sore! I have also been getting pain in my elbows. I was diagnosed in Jan. of this year with stage 1 DCIS, ER, PR +, her2neg and neg nodes. Had a lumpectomy and 33 rounds of radiation. Is the soreness going to be around for the next 5 years or is it temporary? My mood swings are really getting bad. I feel for my husband! Some days I'm happy as a lark then I'm crying and so depressed! HELP! Thanks! CK As bad as breast cancer is, your's appears to be so very treatable based on the specifics you provided - good for you!! I've also had quite a bit of soreness, specifically at the elbows. Also some other muscle/ligament issues. My med onc explained that the arimidex irritates ligaments and causes tendinitis. However, there isn't any alternative to the 5 year misery that I have discovered. I went to an ortho for the elbow and trigger finger issues and she explained that because the pain and inflamation was diffuse throughout both joints, she could not diagnose it as \"tennis elbow\". Even if she were to give me a cortisone injection (which I have had in the past by another ortho), it would not solve the problem for more than a few months and then it would likely come back worse than before. (She works at Yale-New Haven in CT, which is an excellent teaching hospital with access to the latest information and treatment options). Her suggestion was physical therapy to build up the muscles that support the joints. The pain has lessened somewhat and I am at the gym 3 days a week doing the exercises and other happy horse s--t that you do at a gym. (Can you tell I'm not really a \"gym person?\") Re the mood swings, I'm taking Trytophan, a natural supplement, on the advice of my trainer who is also a naturopath. (The trainer is supplied by Yale as part of a cancer study in which I am involved). It seems to have helped some, but I will admit that sometimes I just want to take more drugs. The only thing that stops me from going on another mood stabilizer is the thought of being \"addicted\" to a legal script. Another issue on another board - mental health. You might try the natural supplement route - my trainer's email is * commercial email address and/or contact information removed by hb-mod, moderator * I hope this has helped - let me know how you make out and good luck!

      "Content": "I'm into my second year of arimidex - have you had any emotional issues (highs and lows) as a result of your med? The hot flashes are bad enough, but one minute I am screaming in frustration or anger, and the next happy as a clam in mud. It's wearing me (and my husband!) out. Thanks, chris",
