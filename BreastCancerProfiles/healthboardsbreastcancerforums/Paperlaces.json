Because I have dense breast is it better if I ask for other tests? I'm unsure what tests I should be asking for, I'm really worried that I have breast cancer. Hope someone can help with the tests I need to ask for.",

Mammo and Ultrasound left them clueless so now I too go for biopsy. next week Good thing you only have to wait 1 week, I go next week and my wait time is 4 weeks. Yes the waiting is HORRIBLE! Just want it over with with answers. I pray it is benign for you and me. HUGS to you. Please post next week. Wishing you good luck, I'm sorry you have to wait so long. I'm lucky here in Australia mamagrams are free, as are the other scans and biopsy. I too am praying our results are benign Hugs for you too as I know can use one now",
