    "Content": "Yesterday I noticed a bruise on my right breast, I didn't think much of it tbh, although I couldn't think how it got there! Today when I went to have a shower I noticed that the bruise has spread. I now have lots of small dotty bruises covering quite a large area. There is no pain, and there was no injury to my breast which would of caused this. Any ideas what it could be?",
