      "Content": "Hi, I too had an ultrasound done recently (this was the 2nd one done 8 months after the first one which showed both asymmetry and ductal ectasia) I was told to return for another full exam at the general surgeon's office in 6 months which was in Feb. and have a repeat Mammogram on the right side. I questioned the fact as to why I did not have a followup Ultrasound done also and I am so glad to have brought this up to my GYN who also now found something during her exam and last week I had the Ultrasound done which has really gotten me very nervous because the Radiologist came in and rescanned my breast for a while after the technologist and told me to not wait 1yr or 6 months to go by but have whatever is showing up again on the scan biopsied now. He talked about definitely taking tissue samples and using an Ultrasound and a metal clip?? I think he is talking about the Mammotome test, not sure. I too had a LOT of discomfort while the Ultrasound was being done and for at least 2 days afterwards. But I have pain along that lateral side anyways all the time. I'm glad your GYN was contacted because I have not heard a word from my Dr. which is really not good practice. I am so very glad I was going for a 2nd opinion anyway this week but I still am really uneasy about the whole thing. I will certainly keep you in my prayers and please keep me posted. Take care, Sue",

      "Content": "Please ask to have an Ultrasound done. It is important to have more testing done such as an Ultrasound when there is a suspicious density found on a Mammogram. I had assymetry found on my Mammogram and was the only one concerned. When I had the Ultrasound done, there was a 1.5 x 1.0 cm mass found in which I needed to have a wire localization excisional biopsy done to evaluate this lesion further. I ended up having MANY Fibroadenoma tumors removed during the surgery where the lesion biopsied was over 3 inches long!! The Mammogram NEVER showed this mass. I would definitely have your density evaluated further by Ultrasound AND a Biopsy done to diagnose properly. Because this was a change since your last Mammogram AND your mother had breast cancer it is so important to check into this lesion further. Try not to worry too much and I know firsthand how difficult that can be but you need to be on top of this no matter if you have insurance coverage or not. Please let me know what happens.",

Thank GOD that the path report came back as fibrocystic changes (disease?) What I am wondering is I am feeling a thickened area of tissue on the left side now and saw the nurse midwife in my GYN's office yesterday who said it was fibrocystic and that I should not worry but that I should have my surgeon check it out on Friday when I see him. I am really wondering if I should have an Ultrasound done on the left side because one of the masses from the right side was found only on Ultrasound. I would rather be safe than sorry. Any insight??",

Turns out I had many fibroadenoma tumors in my breast and had 3+ inches of the masses removed in an excisional biopsy. I was the one to push for the Ultrasound and it really can make a huge difference in diagnosing a potential problem. Please ask for one! Let me know how you make out.",

      "Content": "Hi, I had my 2nd ultrasound today of my right breast in followup for persistent pain I've had for about 10+ months. I saw my GYN last week who did find a palpable lesion laterally where most of my pain is centered. I did have the first Ultrasound & Mammogram done 8 months ago in which the Ultrasound did show ductal dilitation and duct ectasia and the mammogram showed asymmetry in my right breast. Of course, density was found being I am younger....33 I did see a General Surgeon back in Aug. and again this past Feb. to recheck everything. I was also advised to have a repeat Mammagram done 6 months after the first but another Ultrasound was not recommended and I still wonder why. The most recent Mammogram results showed no change from the study of Aug. 03' The Surgeon told me that my pain was nothing to be concerned with and that it was because of my \"density\". I questioned this when I saw my GYN last week and I had asked why a followup Ultrasound was not done and that is when she sent me for the Ultrasound. Well to say the least I REALLY am freaked out right about now because of what the Radiologist told me when he came in to do my Ultrasound again after the technologist did the scan first. He told me I definitely need to have a biopsy and talked about an Ultrasound guided core needle biopsy and one where there are clips in place. He wanted color to enhance the image on the screen and I heard the ultrasonographer say \"do you want to measure it?\" I believe the area in suspicion is at 9 o'clock and he asked if I had pain and YES did I ever while the scan was being done. But really the pain is no different than what I've been experiencing all along. As I write this I also have pain by my lymph nodes under my arm which I never noticed before. All I have to say is that I am SO glad I had asked to have this Ultrasound done and actually I did have an appointment set up anyways for a second opinion from a notable breast surgeon. But needless to say, I am extremely nervous. I wonder if the biopsy the Radiologist was talking about is the Mammotone? Any insight would be greatly appreciated.",

      "Content": "Hello, Wow, it is interesting because I had a diagnostic mammogram + ultrasound done last week because I thought I had felt something in my right breast along w/a good deal of pain. Supposedly, when I was at the imaging center, the results of the mammo were normal but they still wanted to do the ultrasound. Turns out the ultrasound of the area that was bothering me the most was ok but the technician said the radiologist wanted her to scan the outer side of my right breast. She was quiet for a while and then she said she wanted to show the radiologist the ultrasound because she saw something on the image, she said it looked like \"ducts\" but she wasn't sure. She came back and said I should return in 6 months. I was nervous after all that and of course couldn't stop thinking about this. Also, I was in pain for 5 days beyond when I had the mammogram & ultrasound and actually the area that was suspicious on the ultrasound has been a painful area along w/the other spot. I received a letter yesterday stating that there appeared to be no areas of cancer on the films but that I should return in 6 months for a repeat mammogram and to evaluate an \"area of concern\". Well I called my gynecologist's office and spoke w/her and she told me my mammogram showed I have very dense breasts and that if I was still concerned I should see the surgeon and have him do a full breast exam. I will be seeing him in 2 wks and really am concerned about this. I am 33 yrs old and have never had children. I have read that cancer can show in the ducts a lot so I hope and pray everything is okay. I am prone to cysts so maybe that is all it is. What do you think of this?? I'd appreciate any insight.

      "Content": "Well I read my mammogram and ultrasound report and I am concerned about both. The mammogram report states that there is some asymmetry in the lateral tissues of my right breast and that further eval. w/ultrasound is recommended. The Ultrasound report stated that there are some areas of ductal dilatation along the lateral side and ductal ectasia was noted in the lateral tissues. As I mentioned before, a 6 month mammographic follow-up study of the right breast would be recommended and the report stated as long as there is no palpable abnormality noted in this region. When I talked to my Dr. the other day, she did recommend that I have a breast exam by the general surgeon and to bring my tests w/me. The only finding she told me about was the fact that I have very dense breasts and that's it. She never mentioned about the asymmetry or the ductal involvement at all. Although I did know there was ductal involvement from what the technician told me. But it really surprises me that my Dr. didn't tell me everything because I believe it was her responsibility. I am seeing the surgeon either this wek oe next. I am concerned.",

      "Content": "Hello, I am 33 and I have had continual pain along the lateral side of my right breast for the past 8 months and I had my first Mammo done in Aug. 03' along w/an Ultrasound. There was a suspicious area of asymmetry found on the right breast along w/ductal ectasia. I was also told I have very dense breast tissue. The Radiologist then recommended I have a repeat Mammo done in 6 months only on the right side which I had done last month. The results came back as the suspicious area is unchanged from the last study but I am wondering why I did not have another Ultrasound done then too to compare w/the last one?? I still have a lot of lateral pain which is not cyclical and is present all the time not just before or when I have my period. I saw my General surgeon yesterday who was not concerned and said the pain is from my dense breast tissue?? He told me to come back in 1yr and have another Mammogram done then as well as an exam. I was in a LOT of pain after the breast exam yesterday with the surgeon. The pain was all laterally again and would not let up and I even have it again today. Is that normal?? I do see my Gyn in a week and I will question her about this more. I am concerned because I don't believe I should be having pain daily?? I have been taking pain medication for my TMJ and knee joints but I don't think that would cause the pain. I am seriously considering going to another notable breast surgeon for a second opinion. Any insight would be appreciated. Thanks for reading this. Sue",

If I were you I would call the Radiology office you are going to on Monday or Tues. and ask if there is anything available sooner than the 17th or maybe you can go to another Radiology office and be seen sooner. Just be sure that whichever Radiology group you do go to, find out their credentials and if they are board certified. I know it is a week after the US that you are seeing your Dr. but that is not unusual. I myself had to wait a full 3wks from when I saw the surgeon and when I had the excisional bioposy done at the hospital. Talk about being stressed and nervous, oh my was I ever. And would you believe after going back 3x's to have the surgical site drained, I did a self exam right when my period ended the other day and I now feel a lump on the medial side (inside) of the same breast When I had the 2nd Ultrasound done in April they were only concerned w/the lateral side (outside) and did not scan my entire breast so now I am nervous once again I'll be seeing my surgeon this week and I'll let you know what he says. Please let me know what happens w/you. I be saying prayers for both of us that these lesions are nothing. Take care, Sue",
