    "Content": "Hi, Just wanted a bit of advice really and to see if anyone has had any similar experience. Last night I found a really hard small lump about 1-2 cm away from my nipple, it didnt really hurt but it concerned me and myself and my husband said that i should go see the doctor in the morning. But when I have woken up this morning it doesnt appear to be there anymore, which of course has worried me more. On that particular side I have had a few times that I have had lumps come up in my armpit that have been so painful that |I have had to see the doctor and get antibiotics. Has anyone else had anything like this? thanks linz",
