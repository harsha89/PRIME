      "Content": "I had my annual mammogram Wednesday, 2-27-13. I received a call from my doctor's nurse yesterday, they want me to have a second one done tomorrow. The nurse told me that there were two areas, one on each breast that was not there last year (2-2-12). I requested a copy of the report... it stated that there has been development of focal asymmetrics in the deep central right breast on MLO view and in the posteromedial left breast on CC view. Fibroglandular elements are moderately dense with asymmetric distribution pattern otherwise. I have had the fibroglandular elements for years. Four years ago I had some issues on both of my breast, but after 2 mammos and one ultrasound I was assured that all was good. I do have a family history of cancer.on my mother's side, however I know very little about my father's side, other than I had some aunts who had breast fever (?) and died in their 50s. I have gone online to look up the working on the mammo report, however it was not very helpful. thank you.",

      "Content": "Still waiting to hear back on my second mammo last Wednesday. Talked to the doctor's nurse, she called the radiologist... and apparently all my mammos from the last 6 times have been sent to yet another doctor. It has me bothered that a third radiologist has been asked to view..and no one can tell me anything... any suggestions..",
