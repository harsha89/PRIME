    "Content": "My wife had a mammogram last week and hasn't heard any results. They told her it could be 10 days and it's been 9 (counting the weekend). She doesn't have any reason to think that anything is wrong, but worried that it is. She's also battling anxiety, so the wait doen't help with that. Her GYN apparently is outsourcing the readings to another town (3-hours away). Anyone have any thoughts on the timeframe?",
