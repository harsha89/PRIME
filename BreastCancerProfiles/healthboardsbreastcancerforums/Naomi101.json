    "Content": "Hi there! I don't know if I can really answer your question, but not too long ago I brought up a topic in the Women's Forum about one breast being larger than the other. Seems like it's pretty common for the left breast to be larger. I have the same problem! The left is probably a full cup larger than the right! Hopefully, someone may be able to ease your fears regarding the rest of your questions.",
