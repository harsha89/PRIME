    "Content": "I'm almost seven weeks post-surgery now, and can finally stretch my arm all the way over my head without shooting pain down the arm. Still have some puffiness in the breast above the incision - the lymph site is doing very well, but I agree that the pain there was worse and lasted longer... although I am having lingering pain in the breast and shooting pains through the nipple. I guess it's all so individual - how big the lump, where, age, health, skill of the surgeon, etc. For those experiencing swelling at all I recommend lymphatic drainage massage - very effective, soothing and non-invasive. It has helped my post swelling dramatically. Also pure lavender oil helps the wound heal faster and reportedly helps minimize scarring. It's very healing.",
