    "Content": "Hi everyone. I just received my mammogram results and it showed no masses or calcification. But it did say enlarged axillary nodes in both breasts. I do get frequent sore, itchy, kind of pain in my armpits. No infections that I know of. Could it mean that the mammogram missed something and the enlarged nodes are a sign? Has anyone here had a normal mammogram but enlarged axillary nodes? What resulted? Please respond as I am very worried (like a lot of other people on this board). God help us. Thanks. Could a reaction to the deodorant cause enlarged axillary nodes?",
