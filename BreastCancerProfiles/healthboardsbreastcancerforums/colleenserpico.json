    "Content": "My Dr. noticed palpable abnormality during routine exam. I had a mammogram, then another one that was different from the first one (?). The radiologist sent me directly to ultrasound. After the technician took the results back to the radiologist, he came in and had her do it again in 2 spots. He then told me that there were some abnormalities and he suggested a biopsy. Findings: 2 o'clock note is made of a sold lesion with lobulated margins, taller than wide with some posterior shadowing which measures 6x4x5 mm. Then the 2 o'clock again says note is made of a cystic focus 7x4x4mm. 2:30 position, note is made of a hyperechoic lesion with irregular margins, wich appears somewhat spiculated. Realtime imaging this measures approximately 5x2x4 mm in size. And finally at the 6 o'clock a small cluster of cycsts is identified. The report says BI-RADS CATEGORY 4 - Suspicious. Two \"hyperachoic\" (that's how it's spelled on the report) solid subcentimeter lesions at the upper outer quadrant. Then the Recommendation says: Sonographically guided biopsy of the two hypoechoic (and that's how that one is spelled (?)) masses. Then goes on to say subsequent recommendations would be made for suspicious groupings of calcifications identified at the left upper outer quadrant as well as the retroareolar regions. I have no clue at what any of this means..? Biopsy was suppose to be last week but when I got there, they didn't have the equipment at that facility and are suppose to call me to set it up.",
