I went with a second opinion after the first surgeon suggested that an open biopsy was the only option for me. He didn't even discuss with me about needle biopsy until I asked about it. He said then that I'm not a good candidate for a needle biopsy. SO I left his office and found another doctor who is a breast specialist and he did a core needle biopsy on both breasts. I think you should really seek a second and a third opinion if needed before you make your choice. Its a big decision, and since I'm only 34 years old, I need to know all there is to know before you open me up and take a big chunk of my tissue from my breast. So please be inform about all your options before making an educated decision, I know I did! The wait for the result is killing me!",

      "Content": "Dear soyaandpepper, I had 4 chemo treatments of AC and 4 treatments of TC. I had my chemo first because my oncologist wanted to see if the treatment was working and my tumor was the size of a golf ball and it shrunk continuously so that when I was finished with treatments it was a small lump 9 mm in size. I was greatful I had not had any surgeries because I was able to see if the tumor responded to treatment and had it not I would have known and been able to change treatments. Now as to radiation, I had my mastectomy before radiation because my tumor was so large and my breast so small that when they went in to do a lumpectomy if I had chosen that there would have been so little breast tissue left that when I had radiation the tissue would have been rendered not viable and reconstruction would have been next to impossible. so I chose to have mastectomy so that I will be able to have reconstruction without difficulty. As for radiation my tumor was so invasive and had already spread to my two nodes under my arm and I was triple negative which basically means that the tumor had 1% that was progesterone based and 10% of the tumor was progesterone based so that leaves 89% of the tumor we do not know where it came from. I was also her2 negative so I could not use herceptin. There are so many different caveats to this so there is a book called Be A Survivor by Vladimir Lange and he wrote this when his wife who was a doctor as well as he himself was a doctor but she developed breast cancer. It is a very informative book. I would suggest it to anyone going through this. You are so numb and feel as if you have been sucker punched when you are going through this so you can read this at home or win the doctors office etc at your leisure. This will have all the terminology explained and broken down. Hugs",

      "Content": "Soyaandpepper, I am so sorry about your diagnosis. I had stage 3 ductile carcinoma that spread to two lymph nodes. I am through with chemo and have had a mastectomy and finished 28 days of radiation. My tumor responded well to chemo. It was so large and my breast so small therefore it had to be removed. Please stay aware of your options and know what medications you are on. One of the scariest things I noticed when I was going through chemo is how many women just blindly followed their oncologist. Yes he's or she's a doctor but know what they are doing and when and why they are doing it. Write everything down and ask questions and write answers down. Good luck, my prayers are with you.",

The worst part is the numbing shots had one on breast and one under my arm. You are right the waiting is the hardest part. My house was spotless. My dogs were washed toilets cleaned, refrigerator cleaned out. Worry adds not a cubit to your stature. My prayers and support go to you.",

I am just finishing 28 days of radiation and Prior to that I had a mastectomy and prior to that 8 rounds of chemo. I know you and your Mom feel like you have been put through the ringer. look at it this way you are going through this waiting to head anything off early. So slow down and stay busy you and your mom until the results come back. I am extremely sorry you are having to wait on a backed up lab system. Hugs.",
