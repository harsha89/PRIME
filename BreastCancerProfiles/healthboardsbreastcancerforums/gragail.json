    "Content": "Hi, I am taking Arimidex, for two months. I took Femara for two months, and had so much leg pain, I was taken off Femara and put on Arimidex. Now, I am having worse pain than while on Femara. I can hardly get up and down and my legs get stiff if I stand long. It is like I cannot control my leg movement at times. I wonder if this is permanent. I just want to stop hurting. Tell your mom, that I do wish her well. Gail, 65 years old. Had stage two breast cancer last July, and had a masectomy last August. Took Cytoxan, Neosar and then Adriamycin, Rubex and Taxol. (chemotherapy) I think the Taxol did a number on my bones. That is really when I think the pain started. Anyone else that has taken Taxol, please let me know what you think. Thanks",
