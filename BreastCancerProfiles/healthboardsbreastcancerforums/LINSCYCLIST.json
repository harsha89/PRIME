    "Content": "Are there any women out there who have had trouble with fibrocystic breast - particularly in one more than the other and a feeling of fullness under the arm and on the sides of the breast. I went to the doctor's recently as my left breast seems to be getting denser than my right. Before my periods my breasts swell and I feel discomfort under both arms but worse under the left and again there seems more fibrous material there. The doctor told me that fibrous changes can extend under the armpit as that is regarded as part of the breast. I don''t get it every month - sometimes I am not aware of any discomfort for three or four months and then it comes back and I have a feeling of fullness on the outer side of the breast and under the arm.. I can't detect any lumps at all. I am 42 and I think I h√°ve been having a few hormonal ups and downs and my mum experienced an early menopause at 39 which could be linked. Any feedback or advice would be much appreciated",
