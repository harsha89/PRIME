    "Content": "Hi, my sister has just been to the doctor because her nipple has been slowly inverting for a while now, she didn't see anyone about it because she was embarrased. She is only 23 years old and the dr is sending her in for a mammogram tomorrow. He was quite concerned about it but of course without any test could not tell us what it may be. She is VERY worried that it may be cancer, has anyone else had this problem?? She also has a lump behind her nipple and aparently a few months ago it became quite infected with pus etc. I just want to be able to give her some hope.",
