      "Content": "Thank you for your response Freckles. My husband and I have been discussing what I should do next. Like me, he thought the diagnosis was a good one to go with. But after I informed him what my friend said this weekend and others have said, his concern has grown also. We had another friend who had been given a clear diagnosis for her breast issues and it turned out to be malignant. When she went back for her records, they conveniently disappeared. I'm not going to run into ER or anything, but now I'm aware that more follow-up may be a consideration. I did not go through my doctor or anything, I just went and had the mamo done without follow-up. Now, I am considering taking the findings and seeing a specialist to be on the safe side. Thank you again.",

      "Content": "Hello all, I haven't posted on this particular board, but about two months ago I had a bit of an alarm come up. It started when there were many findings in my lungs, multiple pulmonary nodule and opacities in lower lungs, in addition to pleural effusions, which they have been \"monitoring.\" Evidentally, the pleural effusions I had, and additional fluid in the lungs can cause chest pains. Many of which were coming from my breast area. Since I am 45 and had never had a mammogram, I thought I needed to have it checked just to be sure things were okay in that area. Well...they called me back for an ultrasound indicating there was a mass in my left breast. It's strange that I never felt it, but, after putting my fingers on both sides, instead of pushing from one side, it was there, plain as day, about 1 1/2 inches by 1/2 inch. Anyway, I could definitely see the black spot on the ultrasound. When the man with the personality of a rock...the radiologist, came in, he said it was just a fluid filled cyst, told me to come back in 6 months, and went on his merry way. I was good with that since I have been so worried with the lung stuff, I thought I'd take the good diagnosis and run with it. Now, about two months later, some friends have mentioned that it should have been aspirated. The pleural effusions from my lungs have absorbed into my body and the pain is gone. Do these cysts absorb also? It's still there. Another friend warned me that she was past off for a cyst she had elsewhere, and it turns out it was life-threatening. She said you definitely have to be your own advocate in the health department. Well, I'm a bit concerned now. I guess what I'm asking is if any of you with some previous findings would advise something other than the 6 month follow up...just curious. Thank you in advance for any input you may have.",
