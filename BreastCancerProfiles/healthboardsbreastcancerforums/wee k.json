    "Content": "HI All, I am new to this and look for some advice. I am 31 and recently found what feel likes a small painful lump under my left nipple. I'm not even sure if it is a lump as it doesn't feel round and feels a bit lumpy if that makes sense. I have been to see my doctor who has referred my to the hospital, however my appointment is 3 weeks away and i can't stop thinking about it. Can anybody shed some light on what this might be? Sorry i should have said that the pain feels like a knot or something and is there all the time.",
