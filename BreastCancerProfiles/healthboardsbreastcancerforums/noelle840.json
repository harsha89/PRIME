      "Content": "Definitely contact your OBGYN. But also do get a second opinion. I was diagnosed in 2006 with breast cancer. There is no history of breast cancer in my family. Cancer has no prejudice. It doesn't care about age, race, sex, etc. Sometimes with dense breasts cancer can be missed. You can also request a needle aspiration of the lump. It's not a fun test but worth having done. My lump was found during my routine exam. They did another mammo which I waited for them to view the images. 15 minutes later I was having the ultrasound. The tech called the radiologist in and all he would say was it was suspicious. They had already made an appointment for me with a surgeon a few days later. The surgeon took 3 samples during the aspiration. 5 days later the pathology report came back positive. Good luck and don't take no for an answer from your doctor.",
