    "Content": "Hi Ive been married to my wife for 2 years and lived with her for 2 years before we got married. I was just wondering is it normal to have \"lumpy\" breast. Shes always had them since ive known her. Shes 23 now and Ive known her since she was 19. She has large breast (38 DD), all natural. Im not trying to sound rude by stating her cup size so dont take that the wrong way. She has lumps or cyst all thruought both breast, they are about twice the size of marlbes, but not hard like marbles, they are soft in texture. Last year when she had her pap smear, this young female intern scared us half to death and told us she needed a mamogram because she found several lumps in her breast. We got a 2nd opinion with a doctor and he said that he didnt feel anything but normal breast tissue in her breast, he said she should get a mamogram to be sure but he didnt feel anything abnormal. Well we didnt get the mamogram, I guess she should of because now Im still worried. I guess my main question is it normal for women with large breast to have cycstic or lumpy breast? Are the cyst just common characteristics in large breast? I dont know because Ive never spent that much time examining any other woman with large breast. I tend to be somehwat of a worrie wart so I was just looking for some opinions from women who would know. She has no other symptoms. Should I be worried or is this normal? Thanks",
