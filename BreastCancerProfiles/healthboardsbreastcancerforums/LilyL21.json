    "Content": "Okay, I figured you ladies would know if I should worry or not. I noticed a lump in my armpit when I was in high school. It's very squishy and not hard at all. I was a tad concerned, so I went to the doc. He said it was nothing but extra breast tissue and it is very common, and I had a CT to confim it. I had unrelated surgery 3 weeks ago. About 1 week after surgery, the lump started hurting. It's very tender. This has happened before: my breasts get tender with PMS somtimes and the armpit lump does too. But now it hurts independently. Anyone with insight on what's going on and if I should bring this up to my doctor? Thanks.",
