    "Content": "Hi...... about a week ago I found a lump in the upper left hand quadrant of my breast. it is in the outer upper part in seems to be embedded in my chest wall I can only feel half of the lump. when I woke up this morning there was a small bruise at that location as well as tiny pin size red dots. I have a very strong feeling that this is cancer..... has anyone had anything like this when you first found out??? I haven't had the best luck in the past and just want to make sure that I am preparing myself for what might be to come. I have a diagnostic mammogram scheduled for October 5 and an ultrasound..... it's only a few days away but I feel like it's too long.... any suggestions",
