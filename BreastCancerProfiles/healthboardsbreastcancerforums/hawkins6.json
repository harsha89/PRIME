    "Content": "Female, 68 years old. Mammogram every year. I have always had dense breasts, so recalls for more testing isn't unusual. However, at the beginning of April I had my mammogram, got the call the following week for more testing. Two weeks ago had a cone down compression and an ultrasound. Now scheduled for a breast MRI. The waiting is freaking me out. If early detection is the key to a better recovery, why am I made to wait this long?? I called Moffitt, the closest cancer hospital to me and their wait time is 2 weeks. And that is just for a consultation. Than they do retesting, which I'm guessing will take several weeks. Anyone else dealing with this? I need somebody to talk with, but there doesn't appear to be anyone (in the medical profession) who sees the urgency or cares.",
