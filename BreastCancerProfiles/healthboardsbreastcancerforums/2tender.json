    "Content": "I had bilat mastectomies 3 years ago with reconstruction and it takes awhile for your body to recover. You will have good days with energy and others that you are wiped. If you can get out and take easy walks, with your surgeons approval, that is what helped many to gain it back. You will have chemo coming up soon after healing also. Listen to your body and get the rest you need. Also check out the Susan G Komen website as they also have a message board with women from all over the country that have dealt with BC and many forums. You will find ones also with women going through chemo that might help you!! Very supportive board and people are on it alot. Good Luck to you!!! 2tender",
