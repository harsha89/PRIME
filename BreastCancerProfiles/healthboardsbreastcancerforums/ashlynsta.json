    "Content": "So I'm getting a little worried about my breasts and how they are changing. I'm 18 years old and over the past couple months both nipple have been crusty and I've been able to push them in to become inverted but they always come back to normal. But recently the left one has started to bleed from time to time, which I only thought was before my period started, but a couple days ago it bleed so hard during the night that it stained my shirt about an inch. I also noticed that morning my right breast was red and became a rash that harden into a scab. It's been normal ever since except a little sensitivity. I do have family history of breast cancer, my mom died from it 15 years ago after the doctors failed to diagnose her because they said it was benign and she had a 98% chance of living. And I don't want to be that 2% where the doctors were wrong so please, any advice would help! Thank you.",
