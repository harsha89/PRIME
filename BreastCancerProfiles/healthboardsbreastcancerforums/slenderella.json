      "Content": "I'm no doctor but I can tell you this. No malignancy... praise God!! That means no cancer. I have an intraductal papilloma too and my doctor tells me (I have seen a breast surgeon as well) that nothing has to be done about it. A papilloma is a wartlike growth near the nipple, and you can get some nipple discharge with it, sometimes a little bit of pain. I understand your emotions. When I had my needle biopsy I was so surprised that I honestly didn't even feel it much at ALL. I was worried about nothing, and thankfully my results were benign and it was just a cyst. blessings, Sue",

      "Content": "The above is a great answer. I would not worry excessively, but I would also not ignore this, considering that your mom had breast cancer. My sister has (since a teenager) fibroadenomas. They are bean shaped, on the side of each of her breasts, and they don't hurt and are movable. It's totally benign, if you have this. Of course, you want to be super sure. If I were you? I'd go to another doctor for another exam, and a fresh set of hands. If they say you're fine, don't sweat it anymore. Sue",
