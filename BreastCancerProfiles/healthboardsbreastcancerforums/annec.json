    "Content": "I had ovarian cancer and had 6 treatments of taxol/carboplatin. You do get joint pain for 2 or 3 days after treatment and have a couple of days of feeling really tired. I didn't get sick at all. They have drugs now that help with alot of the side effects. If you are going to have any kind of bad reaction to it, it will happen within the first 10 or 15 minutes of treatment. As long as your mom lets her doctor know everything that she feels she should do ok. also constipation is a side effect but usually a stool softener or laxitive takes care of that. Everyone reacts alittle differently to it so just tell the doctor everthing and they can recommend whatever might be needed for the side effects. I wish her well!",
