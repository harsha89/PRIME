      "Content": "Thanks to everyone. I had my surgery (lumpectomy with wire localization) yesterday. It was not bad. Now it is the wait for the pathology report to come back they said a week, I hoping earlier than that. My incision is about 3 1/2 to 4 1/2 inches long, looks pretty straight for now. Put together with glue, no staples or steri strips. nothing. I don't go back to see my BS for a month unless i have a problem. Thanks everyone.",
