    "Content": "Hi. I have dense, lumpy breasts. Over the years, I've had biopsies of lumps, drained and samples. Now that I'm 62, this is my 2nd Pre-cancerous Atypical Ductal Hyperplasia or pappaloma (sp). The first was on the L. fall of 2011, now I'm scheduled for the R. 8/7. I had my 6 month mammo, then an ultrasound, then an MRI. Then they did the sample biopsy. On 8/7, they will put me out and get the duct. I found out when I was a baby, I was born with a mole that the dr. said would grow and get in the way of my bra strap, so they went ahead an radiated it... !!!! Well, the dr. was not happy to hear that today. So my chances apparently increase for Cancer. After L side in 2011, I saw an oncologist who suggested Tamoxifen. Well, I'm on a boat load of meds now, I said I would pass for now. And I said the same thing today, where I'm on so many meds, I really don't want to add more. So he agreed that if I were to go to the next step closer to cancer, we would re-think that possibility. I don't know if I've helped anyone by telling my story, I hope so. I have to tell you it feels better to share. Thanks.",
