      "Content": "Some hospitals do not have a radiologist trained in mammos working every day. My small hospital always likes to have mammos read by 2 radiologists just to ensure accuracy. You are lucky they are calling you back. Now I read your next post. Birads 4 means that a biopsy should be done to evaluate the lesion for CA - unless they want to do an open bx I don't know why you would see a surgeon before the stereotactic bx. I f you have DCIS perhaps they are trying to get the entire area with the stereotactic bx and would avoid surgery. The stereotactic biopsy is done with you laying on your stomach. They use U/S to locate the spots they want to biopsy. They numb the area and then take what they want. For me it was samples 3cm x 1mm 6 of them. There was still DCIS left after BX. I would recommend writing down ALL your questions. That's what I do and it really helps me with what is going on. Good luck Pupcake",

For equivical- if htey have enough tissue they run a FISH test which will show - or +. If it is DCIS-They try to remove it with a lumpectomy then radiation tx for 6 weeks. If you have positive nodes then you are looking at chemo. So far the waiting is the hardest part for me. Take a notebook with your questions to the appt next week. Also check out breast cancer .org.
