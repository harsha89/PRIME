      "Content": "I am 32 years old, and have had fibrocystic breast disease for many years. I have one cyst that is always there, and evry few months it gets quite painful for a few days (particularily if I have been having a lot of coffee). My doctor checked the other day, and mentioned that it was there and did I notice it. I asked is she could tell for sure if it was indeed a cyst, and she said yes. She then asked if I had any history of breast cancer in my family, which I don't. Then she asked if I had ever had a mammogram. I haven't, but now a few days after our conversation I'm wondering if maybe I should. Does anyone have any advice for me on this one? Should I call the doctor back and ask her to order one? Thanks!",

Thank you all for your info. I will call the doc tomorrow. Best wishes Zerberbaby, thanks for shocking me into making the call, I needed that! I hope everything turns out well for you!",

      "Content": "I had my ultrasound and mammogram done a few weeks ago. When I got into the mammography room, they told me I was too young,and they would do the ultrasound first, and if they saw anything, then they would do the mammogram. Well, they ended up doing both in the end. What they found was a very small intramammary-lymph node, and on the report it said that they recommend I come back when I am 40 (I'm 32 now). What does this mean? Why would there be a lymph node just hanging around there on it's own? Why is it hard? It hurts on and off, a burning type of pain. Any ideas?",
