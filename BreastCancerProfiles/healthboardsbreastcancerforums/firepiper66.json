    "Content": "hello everyone, my thoughts are with all of you battling this disease. my apologies for asking a question when currently i don't have breast cancer but i didn't want to surf the net and be bombarded with misinformation. i just turned 40 yesterday and today went for my fourth mammogram in my lifetime. i have a strong family history, mother, grandmother, great aunt, all post menopausal but with declining age of diagnosis. when i had my mammogram today the tech was great and showed me pictures. the hospital just got a new digital mammogram system. i saw everything clearly but also saw two very bright white dots on my left breast film, i didn't ask her since a; i kinda didn't want to know and b; i know they can't say anything. the radiologist is supposed to read films either today or monday. i don't feel any lumps but am wondering if these two white things i saw are lumps or masses? i hate to think negatively but each time i go for a mammogram i have a total breakdown, i cry, my heart races, etc, everywhere i turn or read it's breast cancer, breast cancer, and i totally panick, i'm not proud just honest. obviously i don't know how to interpret digital pictures (i'm a nurse which makes any medical test ten times worse because i just google away...lol) but just want to be prepared if this is an obvious sign of something up. thanks to anyone who takes a minute to answer. And to all of you my prayers are with you all. my mother is a breast cancer survivor of 8 years, i also have two friends my age who are past their five year mark. god bless karen",
