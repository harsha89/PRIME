    "Content": "I would never advise anyone to avoid mammograms. I've already had one benign cyst removed from my breast that could well have turned malignant. It was the mammogram that found it. If I have breast cancer I'd like to discover it as quickly as possible. Some growths are not feelable... this one was back by the rib cage and if malignant would have been deadly for its position. No self breast exam would have detected it. I go every year and the risk of the small amount of radiation is small considering the risk of cancer.",
