    "Content": "Mizzbelle, I actually have a little experiance with this. The color of your discharge is not worrisome...the green/bluish discharge is from a benign condition, probably cysts of some sort. I had the same thing happen except I was actually having pure blood discharge, I had a mammo (which was abnormal) and a ductogram (which by the way was very painful) anyway I had a huge cyst behind my nipple so they removed it. All was well and the bloody discharge stopped for about a year...then it started again (my nipple was actually excreting by itself the bloody discharge) so I opted to have the entire duct removed. Stay vigalant (I am sorry I can't spell today at all) and stay on top of it and if anything changes go back to the doc. Good luck...another condition that causes your breast to have discharge is Palpalinoma (again, I can't spell, but you might want to ask your gyno/doc about it...it is a begnin condition that could POSSIBLY lead to breast cancer...empahsis on the word POSSIBLE) Becca",
