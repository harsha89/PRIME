      "Content": "As a mother of 2, it sounds to me like your tired. when your tired, everything seems exaggerated. It took me years to get over all the changes from pregnancy and lack of sleep. You may not be eating properly (picking on the kids food, eating cold food, eating too much fast food...), causing many of your symptoms. As a breast cancer survivor, I will not tell you that your too young to get bc. I was 36, but I know many people that were diagnosed much younger. Most breast cancers do NOT have pain, but there are many types of breast cancers and many people have said they have experienced pain prior to diagnosis. I was diagnosed with Inflammatory Breast Cancer. Rare and lesser known, Inflammatory does not come with a lump. Mine showed as a tiny patch of scaly, hard, pink, warm skin. I had shooting pains through my breast from time to time. Mammogram's do not detect Inflammatory BC. A well educated radiologist and a sonogram found my cancer. If you really feel you may have something, a mammogram, breast MRI or sonogram would be the tests to start with. If, and I mean IF they find something, the only sure way of knowing it's cancer or not, is a biopsy. Let someone else wait and see...See a breast specialist and tell him/her about the pain and other symptoms. Best to ease your mind than to continue to torture yourself...",
