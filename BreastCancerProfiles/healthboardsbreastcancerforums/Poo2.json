    "Content": "I had the same thing happen to me. I'm 33 and I have been getting mammograms for the last 3 years. My Great Grandmother on my mom's side died of breast cancer, my mother's mom, my Grandmother had most of her lymph nodes by her breast removed because of cancer and my mother had a double mastectomy because she had breast cancer. My further testing showed that there was nothing abnormal. So yes it is quite common. My question to myself is not whether or not I'll get breast cancer but when. I am at such a high risk. Good luck to you and let me know how the test went.",
