      "Content": "i have recently lost a significant amount of weight, mostly in my breasts. My breasts are.now very saggy and the skin on them feels very thin. I am 28 with 2 kids. I have lots of stretch marks on my breasts. So my question is...While laying on my back should I be able to look down and.see.the outline of the anatomy of my breasts..due to the very thin skin??? I can do my breast exam and it will leave small divots on my breast from where the skin just sits.there. Is thos normal??",
