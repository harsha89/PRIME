    "Content": "About a week ago I suddenly developed a sore nipple on just one breast. It is a bit red and stays erect. It is sore to touch. Went to Dr today and she did breast exam. Said she felt no lumps and there is no discharge. I will be having a mamo as it is time for my regular check up anyway. Dr didn't believe this was anything to worry about but offered no explanation as to what was going on. Could this be breast cancer?? I am still scared even after seeing Dr. I am 49 and past menopause so it is not related to my cycle at all. Any thoughts please????",
