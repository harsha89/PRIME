      "Content": "Thanks JoJo. I bet most doctors wouldn't be so quick to suggest waiting 6 months to do an ultrasound or further follow-up if it was their wife or mother especially when dealing with dense tissue. It was the radiologist who said to come back in 6 months... I might call my GYN and get his opinion. Thanks for sharing your story, and best of luck to you as well. Lynne",

      "Content": "Hello all, I hope someone can answer some questions for me. I am 48 years old. A couple of weeks ago I had a screening mammogram. I received a letter from the hospital saying there were some findings that need further studies and to call my doctor. My doctor's office said I need another mammogram on the right side because of calcifications, so I was able to get an appointment for tomorrow due to a cancellation (thank goodness). I have fibrocystic breasts and have been called back in the past for ultrasounds and needle aspirations due to cysts, but have never been told I had calcifications until now. Can calcifications be inside benign cysts? If this was something to worry about, wouldn't they schedule me for an ultrasound, rather than another mammogram? Thanks for any insight into this! By the way, my mother was diagnosed with breast cancer at age 60, and thought she was cancer-free for 7 years when it turned up in her spine. She died at age 69.",

      "Content": "Well, I had a diagnostic mammogram today on one side. Afterward, the tech came back to my dressing room and told me that the radiologist looked at the film and said that it's \"probably\" benign and to come back in 6 months for another mammogram and and ultrasound just to be sure. I asked whether I could get the ultrasound now \"just to be sure\" and she said that the radiologist recommended 6 months and they would send the report to my doctor. I'm not sure what to think, but I guess I should just try to put it out of my mind for 6 months.",

      "Content": "Thanks for your comments ladies. I have lots of cysts (and have for years), and just thought it a little worrisome that only one particular area had calcifications, which is something new for me. I only drink caffeinated drinks occasionally, but do like chocolate. As much as I love chocolate, maybe I should lay off it for a while to see if the cysts and calcifications will go away. The hospital where I get my mammograms is supposed to get digital mammography next year, so I'm happy about that since digital is supposed to be more accurate on dense breast tissue like mine. It's really scary how much cancer is reportedly missed on dense tissue. Lynne",
