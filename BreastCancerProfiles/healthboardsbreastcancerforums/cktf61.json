She has had a swab taken, blood test (for prolactin level) and an ultrasound, but doctors still don't know what it is. We have been referred to a breast specialist ... but I'm not sure how long before we get to see the specialist. Does anybody have any ideas/been in similar situation? Surely 13 is too young for cancer? My mother was diagnosed with breast cancer a year ago, so I'm a bit worried I know the time frame is past and you may not even come back to this site...but did you ever find out what it is? My daughter who is 14 has the EXACT same problem! Same breast and all.... having hard time getting appointment ASAP so any info you can tell me that would be great! I hope you log into this again! Thanks for any updates!",
