    "Content": "Funny title I know, lol but I have always had a problem with hormones, to the point that I can\u0092t have and children, and don\u0092t get a period with out taking birth control. I only had 2 natural ones in my life and that was only because of the BC I took the month before. So hormones have always been a problem, and I\u0092m wondering if that would have anything to do with my nipple change. Anyways today I noticed a change to my nipple. My nipples always look different from each other, which I figure is natural. But then I noticed some dryness. And I figured because I have eczema it could be that. Then, I noticed a rash around my nipple, when I took a closer look, it isn\u0092t a rash at all, but actually my nipple got bigger, then kind of separated. So the brown aread which looks like a rash, could actually be my nipple. Its hard to explain, its like my right nipple stretched to the point of separating. Does that make sence? Should I get this checked? Is it natural?",
