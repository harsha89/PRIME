      "Content": "I was tested for the BRAC genes and was negative even though I had a strong family history of breast cancer and ovarian in the female side of my family. I understood this to mean that the chances of my sisters carrying the gene as well was very slim. if I had been POSITIVE though it would mean that they would need to be tested since the gene WAS present. My oncologist tested TWICE as he was sure I should have been positive. The Geneticist was pleasantly surprised.",

      "Content": "I went for a routine mammogram and TWO spots were detected.. one was .6 and one was .3 ( yes POINT 3 and POINT 6) . As a result i was able to have a simple lumpectomy and then 5 days of radiation. I was a mess until I got my results but the outcome wasn't as bad as I feared. I am doing some genetic stuff ( the BRAC 1 Brac 2 tests ) but a diagnosis of breast cancer isn't a death sentence like years past",
