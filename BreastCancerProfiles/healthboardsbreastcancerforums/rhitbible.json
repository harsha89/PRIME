      "Content": "I know this might sound kind of strange but right now this is the only forum I have to just kind of talk about whats going on so please have patience. I have accepted another position and will be leaving the person that I work with. I feel guilty because I am leaving and won't be there everyday to be encouraging. I am also a little confused by why she doesn't want to tell her two grown sons what is going on. One is getting married next summer and while she says she \"wants to be there, but doesn't know if she will\" she doesn't want them to know in case they change their minds and move the wedding date ahead. She is also afraid that when I go into my next job, I will tell someone about her cancer. Any suggestions. We have a cancer support group at work and I will be joining that shortly. Thanks again",

She seems very angry today, it doesn't help that I have accepted a new job and will be leaving the office soon. Her husbnad wants her to retire and be home with hi. They aren't going to tell their kids, they don't want to ruin the big weddingplans for next summer. I think they are going to feel worse when they found out. It is good just to have this place to express feelings and thoughts. Sue",
