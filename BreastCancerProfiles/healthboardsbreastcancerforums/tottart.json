    "Content": "Hi there, I would definitely follow through with a biopsy, just to rule out breast cancer. I was 32 years old and woke up in the middle of the night with a 'deep' itch on the side of my right breast. This itch actually woke me up, I scratched it and felt a lump. A mammogram and ultra sound showed nothing in my breast, but I was suspicious and had a biopsy - it was invasive cancer. The pathology report after my mastecomy showed a second tumor in the right breast that was unrelated to the first tumor. The oncologist suggested a mastecomy on my left breast and I agreed. There was also cancer in four of my lymph nodes so I went through six months of chemotherapy. If I had not followed through on my hunch, I would not be here 19 years later. I will pray for you. Hang in there and best wishes.",
