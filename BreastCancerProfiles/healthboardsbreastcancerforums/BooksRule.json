    "Content": "Since you posted this message on the 7th, you've probably already gone to the next step (whatever that is for you). The only suggestion I would have made to you would be to check with your regular gyn doctor if a suggestion was made by the radiologist to do a needle biopsy. They did one on me (I was told that I could have a needle biopsy there at the imaging center that day, or I could be given a consult with a breast surgeon for a surgical biopsy. Hmmmm, tiny needle or SURGERY? Eeek! I chose the needle). There weren't any problems, but my regular doctor (and later the breast surgeon) weren't happy that the imaging center doc had done the needle biopsy. They both said that it sometimes creates a hematoma or 're-arranges' the appearance of tissue that can screw up any further testing that they might have wanted to do. All's well that ends well, though. The needle biopsy came back benign and my later excisional biopsy was B9 (benign) as well.",
