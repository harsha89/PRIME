    "Content": "Hi: I can't answer your question about stopping prempro, but I had nothing but problems when I took it for menopausal symptoms. It help the symptoms a lot, but I immediately developed many many cysts, which were all benign. I was reading about prempro and according to the womens health initiative it was also responsible for a lot of false positive readings on mamos. I don't know if that is what happened with me, but I became extremely cystic after starting it and then the dr took me off of it. When I went off of it I didn't have anymore cysts, until just recently, but now I'm on a low dose hormone but I can't imagine I've been on it long enough to cause this new cyst only been on the new one for 1 month. I would talk to your dr about it because I've been told by many that the amount of estrogen in prempro was too high. Of course this is the opinions of the drs I've talked to, but I would ask about it anyway. Good luck...",
