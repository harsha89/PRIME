    "Content": "I know it's always frightening when any kind of lump is found, whether it be benign or cancerous. Two years ago I was called back by the radiologist for a \"repeat\" mammo because she saw something suspicious, not only on one breast, but both. I had the \"repeat\" mammogram, ultrasound and needle biopsy. Turned out I had five fibroadenomas, all of which were benign. Coincidentally, the repeat mammo did not reveal the fibroadenoma's; however, they did on the ultrasound. Two years ago, my 18 yr old daughter found a 3\" lump under her arm which could clearly be seen and felt. Turns out it was also a fibroadenoma, which was surgically removed. I was appalled that the surgeon suggested we just \"watch it\" to see if it changed. I was adamant, because of the size, that it be removed. I told the surgeon, \"it's not supposed to be there, so why would we want to watch it?\" Take a stand with your health care.....it's your body and you know it better than anyone.",
