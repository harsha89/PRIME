    "Content": "I'm new here, and I'm not sure if this is where I should post this, but after looking around, I didn't know where else to put it. I noticed a small bump on the outer edge of my ariola about 6 weeks ago. I didn't think anything of it, because there were other bumps, and I thought it was just one of those. A few days ago, I noticed that it has gotten bigger, about the size of a small pea, and that it feels hard. It also moves a bit; not much, but some. Its under the skin, but very close to the surface. I realize that the best advice anyone can give is to see a doctor. I plan on making an appointment tomorrow, but in the meantime, I'm starting to get rather panicked. What I would like to know is if anyone has had something similar and what it might be. Both my grandmothers had thyroid and cervical cancer, and my uncle actually had a lump removed because the doctor suspected it was precancerous. Right now, I just need something to put my mind at ease until I can see my doctor. I apologize for the long post. Any suggestions or thoughts are greatly appreciated.",
