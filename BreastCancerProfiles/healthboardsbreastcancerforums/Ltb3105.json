      "Content": "Quote: Originally posted by emarion: i have what i can best describe as a sore on one of my breasts. it started several months ago as a small patch of dry skin and has grown and gotten red, won't go away. i am scared that this is a symptom of breast cancer. does anyone have experience with this sort of thing??? Please get it checked out, if anything, for peace of mind. I waited for my first mammo and now I've got a suspicious cyst and see a surgeon tomorrow! Never wait especially when something doesn't go away. Let us know how you make out.",

      "Content": "This imagechecker, is it a digital machine? My friend told me it's pretty accurate, yet is it as good as an ultrasound and will it replace the mammo? Sounds more intricate and costly. I don't think every doctor will order it for their patients, mainly those at higher risk maybe.",

      "Content": "I asked the same question, \"why a mammo if results are not always accurate?\" The answer is money because it is more costly to do ultrasounds on everyone, on the other hand, if they can't see a lot of things on the mammo and order the ultrasound anyway, the cost is twofold, so I can see both sides of the argument. Too bad they couldn't just skip the mammo and do ultrasounds on everyone.....wouldn't hurt and should clearly show most conditions.",

      "Content": "Have to see a surgeon Monday, after a suspicious nodule was found after I went back for additional bilateral views and a sonogram. I am scared to death. This was my first mammo and I am 48. I finally decided to go and what I always feared and avoided has happened! They told me I had a lot of fibroid cysts and that the sono was necessary to see whether they were liquid or solid. The solid ones must be checked out. After getting back my films to take to the surgeon Monday, my hubby looked through them and the radiologist's report didn't mention cancer, but something about hyperplasia or hypo something, and because of my mother's history of breast cancer, a biopsy was recommended. Please keep me in your prayers and any info or advice would be appreciated. Laura",
