My biopsy is scheduled for next friday. Thanks ! Hi there! I know it's very hard to not be scared, but I was in EXACTLY your position for the last few weeks. My mammo showed a cluster of microcals, birad 4. I had a stereotactic biopsy, and the waiting was killing me...my doctor called me last Friday and told me all was okay - I had fibrocystic reaction to my breast reduction of 2 years ago! I just have to watch for changes and keep all my appointments. So, try to be positive, it CAN be okay!!!",
