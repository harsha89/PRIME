    "Content": "Supermom3, Don't feel as though you're alone. I have been having problems with supposed 'cysts' since August and I lay in bed every night rolling my left boob around under my fingers. I am at it so much at times, I think I am aggravating the cyst. I swear I find more lumps every time I do this, but according to my Dr., all is fine. I'm hoping that once the aspirations and every 6-week ultrasounds stop, I'll be able to stop as well. LOL PS: I think the reason I'm so inclined to examine them all the time is because my first lump grew to the size of my palm in less than a week. I figure if something can go from undetectable to that large, that fast, I better be checking them constantly.",
