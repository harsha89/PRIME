      "Content": "I will be having a lumpectomy (for lack of a better word). I go the day before to have \"seed localization\" - the doctor says the surgery will be \"breast conservation\" which (I think) means I should finish up looking the same as I do now, other than a small incision scar. The only decision that they left up to me was whether to have \"full breast radiation\" or radiation that targets the cancer site only. The cancer site only will be for 1 week twice a day. The full breast radiation will be 1 time per day for up to 4-6 weeks. I have breast implants. Any insight to provide from anyone who has made the choice either way?",

      "Content": "Had my surgery 1 week ago and was back at work the second day after surgery with only 1 day off. Pain meds make me sick so got by with Tylenol 3 twice during the night and day after surgery. By the weekend had a fainting spell - some of us just don't seem to know how to slow down - duh. Waiting for path report of the nodes. Still thinking in terms of partial breast radiation if nodes are clear. Started getting a little more pain and redness yesterday around the incision sites so decided to take some old Cephalexin I had around the house. Called the doctor about it and they said the little extra pain this late in the stage could be because I'm getting the feeling back to the area and the redness could be from fluid retention around the incision. Just in case, I'm taking the antibiotic anyway. Don't need to add more fuel to the fire.....",

      "Content": "Same here - I took various bone building drugs that gave some improvement over several years but then the bone scans stopped showing improvement so I was taken off the drugs for 2 years (which is about now). I do see an oncologist at some point but today I have been told that the surgeon did not take out enough marging around the tumor and I now have to have another surgery to remove more margin. All my other appointments have now been moved back. Is Clonidine a hormone? The doctor prescribe Effexor extended release for my hot flashes last week. The bottle said take 1 at bedtime so I assumed it would make me drowsy. I was awake all night and jittery. I won't take it again until down the road when the cancer drug kicks in and the hot flashes are supposed to get worse - and even then, in the morning instead of at night. I will say that it seemed to decrease my appetite, which is a good thing. Did you have lymph nodes removed by a separate incision under your arm? That is giving me more pain than the breast incision (2 weeks out and still really painful), particularly the upper/inner arm and around back toward my shoulder blade. Did you experience that? Also, the surgical glue caused my to become very inflamed so I have to take Bactrin.",

      "Content": "Well....so much for wishful thinking. I learned yesterday that my path report came back as being HER2 positive. It never occurred to me that I would need anything other than radiation after surgery, followed by one of the cancer drugs for 5 years or so. The oncologist said that I have to have Chemo first and that radiation might be 6 months down the road. My cancer was stage 1 and very tiny - I was told \"they got it all with plenty of clear margin\" but this type of cancer is highly reoccurring. I asked if I had both breast removed could I just skip the Chemo and the answer was \"No, you would still have to go through Chemo\". I asked if there was any danger to my grown daughters and was told that this was not hereditary. I finally asked if I had caused this myself by taking hormone replacement therapy for 12 years and he said \"Absolutely not\". I don't mind losing my hair, which he said was inevitable but I really fear the nausea and other side effects. He just said that everyone reacts differently and that there was no way of knowing how I would respond and that they would give me medications to help alleviate the side effects. I still can't believe that I really need Chemo but MD Anderson is the best in the country so I have to accept what I'm being told.",

      "Content": "Sorry, I've been absent - I was caught up with the whole work full time/chemo part time..... After my first chemo infusion (TCH), I was sick for 3 days. I learned a lot and before my 2nd infusion, I requested the anti-nausea medicine \"Emend\" to be added to my iv - I HAD ABSOLUTELY NO NAUSEA!!! It made all the difference in how I felt. Sure, I have aches and pains and am tired, but it's the nausea that really knocked me down. Of course, my head had to be shaved just before my 2nd infusion (every 3 weeks) because it had started shedding on day 14 after the 1st infusion. All in all, I think attitude plays a huge role in how a person gets through this - it's just hard to have a good attitude when you feel so sick, as I did the first time. As far as the hot flashes previously discussed, I tried Effexor and just did not feel right on it but I intend to try it again. My cardiologist did switch me to Clonidine but it caused my blood pressure to be too low (although it helped with the hot flashes). He lowered the dosage, the hot flashes came back, I whined and he dropped another of my meds and increased the Clonidine but so far, the hot flashes are not being relieved like they were at first (plus, my b/p is still too low). Who knows where this will end up.",

I've also been diagnosed with estrogen fed stage 1 breast cancer and will have to take one of the \"cancer drugs\" for 5 years. I had been on Premarin for 12 years until my diagnosis March 31st. Of course, I am no longer taking the HRT and the hot flashes/night sweats are on full force and as a result I'm awake at night several times and sometimes just can't get back to sleep at all. I was told that the oncologist would give me something for the hot flashes because whatever cancer drug I will be taking makes it worse. Also I have osteoporosis (hence the HRT) and the cancer drug is supposed to be bad for that so I don't know who will address that issue.....",

Haven't heard back from the pathologist yet but no reason to foresee any problems there. My first oncologist appointment is this afternoon and since I take blood pressure medicine anyway, I've asked my cardiologist to switch me to Clonodine. How are you coming along with your radiation at this point?",

I have almost always gone every year for mammograms but last year, it was all over the news media that the newest recommendations were every other year - so I skipped last year. HAH!!!! Went for mammogram this year, was called back for \"more imaging\", immediately the radiologist requested an ultasound, after which I was told to come back the next morning for a biopsy. Two days later my doctor called to tell me I have stage 1 breast cancer. Go for any medical screening that your insurance company covers (after all they are not just covering you - they are covering themselves). There is a reason the insurance companies pay for these screenings.",
