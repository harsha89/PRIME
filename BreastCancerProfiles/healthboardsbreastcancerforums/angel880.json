      "Content": "Thank you both for your kind words....... so had exam today the doc said she is not overly concerned but that there are some suspicious lumps, she said my breast are fibrous and the elargement is being caused by swelling in my sides not actually my breast enlarging. She said she said very well could be cysts or benign tumors but set me up with an ultrasound at the hospital this friday. If they find anything then a mamogram later that day. She said she requested the ultra sound first because the fibrous tisssue is harder to see through on a mamograhm plus they could also see what the lumps and bumps are on my sides causing the swelling. She actually found a lump in the left on I hadn't noticed. Crazy part is the first lump that concerned her was the one I showed my doc a year ago and he laughed in my face!! Quack..... So just waiting another week for some more tests! thanks to all that read and any comments appreciated.....good health to you all -Jen",

      "Content": "Ok So I have had alot of health probs over the last 3 years. I have a spine disorder and have had surgery for that as well as quite a few disc herniations and diverticulosis.....this starte when I was 25 out of no where now I am 28 yrs old. I have had a lot of lumps under my skin initially only like two or three.around my abdomen on right side. And one in my chest a year ago a doc felt quick and said he thought lipomas. I have two on my chest between breasts and one larger oblong shaped on under right breast about 4 inches long, I have been growing these things pretty rapidly in a years time....a few in right arm pit, my right elbow is swollen, a golf ball in my left elbow but on the upper side not joint and left knee as well. The did an abdominal ct and found nothing but calcifications but there was blood in my urine. I do have right breast tenderness but doc was not overly concerned (however being male he did not want to feel the one under breast nor did he suggest I have someone do so) I have never had a breast exam. I am concerned about the lumps but I havent thought they had anything to do with the breast as they are all over until just this week heres why..... Ok I have been developed for a long time now and I have always worn a 38 big b cup or small c cup.Most c's were too big!!! Over the last few weeks I am busting out of the bras I have had for years......went bra shopping And I cannot fit into anything smaller than a 40 d even bought one 40DD. This is both breasts however my discomfort is in the right one. I have been trying hard to lose weight over past 6 months but only dropped about 14 lbs in 6 months but over the last two or three weeks I have dropped 12 lbs and I have been eating like crap. Doesn't make sense how I can try so hard and lose so slow then all of a sudden without doing anything I am losing....not like my body at all. I am overweight at 5'9 210lbs I wear a size 14-16 I am going to schedule my first breast exam just because I think it wouldn't hurt...hopefully this is just a gift from the gods ...bigger breasts....and smaller tummy.........but it is weird just wondering if this sounds familiar to anyone. Thank you for taking the time to read and wishing you all great health!!---Jen",

      "Content": "hi its been about a week since I posted in now I have some swelling in my right side its not really my breast but the side under my armpit on the side of breast there is a pretty big lump in there the skin is obviously sticking out when I look in the mirror. I finally scheduled a breast exam for this friday hope its nothing!!! If you read this please say a little prayer for me and I will let you all know. I also did not mention there is quite a bit of cancer in my family my grandparents hand lung and skin, my aunt had liver and my 29 year old cousin breast cancer a few years ago...they alll passed due to cancer. But my parents are healthy so I am hoping for the best----Jen",
