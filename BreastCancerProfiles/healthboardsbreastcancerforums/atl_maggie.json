    "Content": "Hi! My aunt has severe side effects from chemo and experiences uncontrollable nausea. Has anyone heard that blackberries help with nausea and other stomach problems??? We found a place in South Georgia that makes a drink called blackberry nectar. It is really just blackberry juice. It has helped my aunt so much!!! I am looking for research on the blackberry/stomach problem connection and wondered if anyone else had tried this or knows where I can find more info?",
