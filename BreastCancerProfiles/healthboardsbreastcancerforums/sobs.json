    "Content": "Hi folks My friend had bc 5 years ago. She went for her mammogram, they sent her for ultrasound, because they could not see clearly from scar tissue. Now, she is scheduled for MRI of her breast. She would like to know about the MRI. Do you go in feet first? Is your head in or out of the machine (claustrophobic issues)? I also read one post here that someone laid on her stomach and they had two holes for each breast. She wanted an open MRI, but the docs told her that they do not \"read\" the breasts well enough. Can someone PLEASE let me know the procedure and description of the machine, body/head position, etc.. Thanks a lot! sobs",
