      "Content": "Leea Thank you for your helpful hints - I know I should be grateful that I've beaten breast cancer and that I'm a survivor - but as you have sited - the hot flashes are just miserable - I seem to get almost one an hour anymore - I have tried evening primrose, and something else that is primarily for incontinence and I am now taking bella donna - none of it seems to help - I've heard really negative things about the effexor and neurontin so I'm really trying to avoid those - You mentioned that you go to another site for advice - can you tell what that is ? Also - I noticed that you said you take Femara - can I ask how old you are ? Because I was told because of my age I had to take Tamoxifan - I've been hearing lately that accupuncture might help as well - have you heard anything - either positive or negative ? Thank you again !",

      "Content": "Leea You mentioned that you had a family history (of breast cancer? ) but yet you still did not do chemo - is that because you were NOT HER 2 positive ? Ive also been looking to natural alternatives as well - such as Dong Quai , Licorice root, and chasteberry - but it is really difficult because of the estrogen producing factor - everything you eat and even natural vitamins either have soy or soy lecithin in it - What kind of shots have you taken ? I am going to my doctor tomorrow for follow up and would like to ask him as many questions as I can think of - He mentioned to me last time about it actually being approved to do a partial hysterectomy on woman with (esp. HER 2 Positive ) breast cancer so that estrogen would be stopped - I'm sure you like many other woman (and me FOR SURE) are always thinking in the back of our minds- will this return ?",

      "Content": "I had been diagnosed with HER2 positive breast cancer, had surgery, been through chemo,radiation and have been given a clean bill of health - now comes the TAMOXIFIN - Must I take it ??? OR can I for go it ? I am 41 years old and have started taken TAMOXIFIN (9 months) I have been going through the most severe of hot flashes (roughly 2 -3 every hour - all day /all night) I feel like I am 90 years old with aches and pains in my joints and have had sufficient weight gain !!!! Believe me - I am playing it by the book - I eat fairly healthy and I exercise just about every other day but I seem to get ZERO relief from any of my symptoms - Is this what to expect for the next 5 years of taking this drug ??? IS IT REALLY NECESSARY FOR ME TO TAKE THIS DRUG OR IS THERE AN ALTERNATIVE SOLUTION ???? I realize that being HER2 positive has more of a risk factor but there should be SOMETHING else that I can do - please help me by supplying alternate solutions - any advice would be appreciated.",
