    "Content": "If the doctor suspected cancer at all he would have been obligated to tell you. A lot of doctors just watch these things; the more you poke around the more likelihood cells break away, even if they are not cancerous who wants division? There are a lot of non-conventional things you can do to be proactive with your body and keep things leaning against cancer. I would carefully look at your diet and get chemicals out; eat more organic and less red meat. Good fruits and vegetables should be the bulk of your diet. There is also a supplement called Solvestrols; there is a preventative formula; all solvestrols are effective and worthy of looking into. Try searching for it. There is a good blog writing on the whole thing as well; it will relief you mind.",
