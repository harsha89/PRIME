      "Content": "Hi Beppie! Sorry I have off the boards for a little while. I have had 2 lumpectomies. My bc was discovered in my annual mammog. 1.5cm. I'm 53. Had first lumpectomy on 6/18 and surgeon did the sentinal node procedure using the radioactive tracer; also just before surgery had a \"needle marker\" inserted using ultrasound as a guide. A cancer tumor does not look any different from healthy breast tissue. So the needle marker was inserter so the surgeon would see the marked tumor, remove it and some healthy tissue around it. He removed 3 nodes and they were initially negative of cancer; and then after further testing still no sign of cancer. However the healthy tissue that was removed did have what is called a positive margin; so another lumpectomy was offered to me or a mastectomy. I chose the lumpectomy since it was done under local anesthesia as out patient(surgeon just deadened the breast site and re entered the same sucture site). About a 20 minute ordeal; he removed the area that had the positive margin and 4 other sites; Test came back 3 days later and 4 of the 5 samples were negative, but darn it, the 5th came back as cancer cells plus an additional 0.4 cm tumor plus other very very small scattered sites of cancer cells. So I'm having the mastectomy tomorrow. I already posted it prev to this post. I was not hormone positive or Her2 postive; So I don't have the ability to be treated with hormone. I'm pre menopausal. But with the mastectomy, I do not have to have radiation; so that 's a plus. I can have reconstruction later if I decide to have it. I will still of course have to have chemo, a 16 week treatment plan some few weeks from now after I healed from the mastectomy. I will stay overnight for the surgery tomorrow. Let me know if I help you with any questions. This board is a wealth of great friends and knowledge. I can't believe I'm writing on here already giving my knowledge is so limited; but compared to 45 days ago, I brilliant on the subject!!! Hah, Hah!; Remember to take one step at a time and you will find some good support in places you least expect it. God Bless and good thoughts your way! happy trails from Texas K D",

      "Content": "going in at 7:30 tomorrow morning for simple mastectomy at 9am. Had my 2 lumpectomies and the last one, last monday still showed cancer cells; I'm what they call a triple negative. high grade type of idc, aggressive and more about 15 very very small scattered sites of some cancer cells in the \"healthy\" tissue they removed and even another 0.4cm tumor. So with all that doctors have recommended the removal of the breast. No underarm surgery; just the breast. Hey, it's not and arm or a leg; I can survive with peace of mind that perhaps all of the cancer was confined to the breast and move forward. Good news is I don't have to have radiation; but will start the 16 week chemo after my body has recovered from this surgery. I have a good attitude and spouse is very supportive. Will think about reconstructive surgery perhaps later this year or next. That does not have to be decided now; anyway, I couldn't even get an appt. with a plastice surgeon for at least 4 weeks and I didn't want to delay my mastectomy any longer. Like I said and ya'll know: Peace Of Mind! It'a a valuable thing. So any of ya'll that have had simple mastectomy,let me know what your recovery was like if you have time. I know I can't drive for 2 weeks but doctor said I could perhaps return to work(desk job) after 1 week if someone drives me. Also will have the drainage tube(that sounds kinda gross) but doctor said really not a big deal. I bought this neat after surgery camisole that you step into and pull up. It has 2 velco pockets inside that you store the drain collector in. And it's made for single or double mastectomy. Insurance may pay for it. So keep me in your thoughts and prayers. God in in control and I'm in His hands. happy trails, kd",
