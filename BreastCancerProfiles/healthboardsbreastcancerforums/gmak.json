    "Content": "Hi tootired, Im really sorry that you now have to have chemo but its so great that the margins are all clear & caught at stage one! i agree with you that MD anderson is the best because my dad was cancer free for years after the drs at md anderson treated his virulent cancer. He did well on chemo with little nausea, although the drs were very good at md anderson to help him with any symptoms he had & i think he did take the nausea meds a few times & it worked, it just depends on the person. Im having a diagnostic mammo & ultrasound on the 27th by the breast dr to start evaluating cause of hot poker breast pain. Will pray for you, im texan too & very thankful that we have Md anderson & think that you are in very good hands! So hoping that you sail through this part & do miraculously well! We are here for you, anytime & God bless you!",
