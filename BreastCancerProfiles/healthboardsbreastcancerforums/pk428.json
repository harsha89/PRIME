    "Content": "Hi! I am 47 and had a double mast in Sept. right side had 1.3 cm invasive cancer and so i had the left side removed prophylacticly just in case. i began breast reconstruction at the sme time. so far so good. i just finished me chemo last week and am scheduled to have the tissue expanders replaced with the implants at the end of april. the chemo was much worse than the surgery. i began feeling pretty normal about 8 weeks after the surgery. i had more pain on my side where i had some little fat rolls under my arms. i had about 45 lymph nodes removed also so i think that also played a part in it. the left breast (without the cancer and with no lymph node removal felt much better much sooner). so if you do it before you have cancer i would expect your recovery to go very smoothly. hope this helps.",
