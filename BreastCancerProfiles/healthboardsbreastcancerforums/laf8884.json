      "Content": "Hi, I've been having problems with my left nipple for about 8 months. First it was extremely unbearably itchy, so much that I scratched it til it became raw. This cleared up but ever since the nipple has been giving me problems. It seems to be erect all the time...not totally constant but certainly noticeable. I talked to my obgyn about this in August and she said it was probably nothing, possible irritation from a sports bra (I left the office feeling unsatisfied). Since then it's been on and off again erect, sometimes a bit scaly or rough feeling and lately I've been having pain on and off in the nipple. I have an appointment again tomorrow because I am so concerned, mainly after reading a post on another web board where a woman had a similar problem and was diagnosed with cancer, only after her doctor blew off her symptoms for a year..so, I'm really concerned now. I'm 31 with no family history (not that this really matters). Has anyone ever heard of anything like this or experienced it themselves? I'd appreciate any response. Thanks, L",

      "Content": "S, Forgive me for not writing back sooner...very busy. I am scheduled for an ultrasound the 22nd of this month. I did get a second opinion and she was not alarmed in the least, but, I have to say that I am still concerned. Something just isn't right here. May I ask, when you had your initial symptoms were they constant or did they come and go? I am feeling like the itching and redness come and go...I probably scratch the nipple too much, therefore making it sometimes feel like it's burning or warm. I don't know if I'm imagining this stuff or what. It's still erect most of the time and the end seems white at times..I don't know, I'm at a loss...thinking of looking for a breast specialist but we'll see what the ultrasound says. Hope all is well with you, L",

      "Content": "Thanks Seek, for replying! I'm sorry you had to go through this whole ordeal but it sounds like you've had a rather positive experience (which is pretty amazing for a cancer story!). I went to see my dr. again last week and basically she said the same thing..\"Possible irritation from a sports bra.\" This is ridiculous. I KNOW it isn't that. I mentioned Paget's to her and she said it wasn't that but, has sent me off to have an ultrasound. I asked her why not a mammo and she said I was too young. Personally I think she's not being thourough enough but she really didn't seem alarmed. I am however, going to get a second opinion tomorrow. The main problem isn't really the itching, scaling, etc...that stuff seems not very severe anymore. Honestly, the main problem I have now is that the nipple is just always erect. I have scoured the internet looking for \"erect nipple\" as a symptom and have come up with literally one post on a cancer board where the woman talked about having an extremely painful erect nipple. I don't have the intense pain, just the erect part. I'll see what the dr. says tomorrow I guess. Thanks so much for replying with your story. -L",

      "Content": "For about a year my left nipple has become erect, on and off for no reason. Just comes out the blue and does not match the right. I asked my doc, she said it wasn't anything to worry about but still it is pretty odd. I have pain in that breast sometimes too so I am starting to wonder if it may be something to be concerned about. To note: I have been on Lexapro for about a year as well and wondering if this may be a weird side effect? I've looked all over the web and \"erect nipple\" has not been listed as a symptom of breast cancer, only inverted nipples. Any clue about this? I'm 31 and never had a mammo...wondering if I should be imaged. Thanks!",
