      "Content": "I'm 29 and recently found a large egg size lump in the bottom of my breast. I have no idea how long it has been there as even afew hrs before I found it, I didn't notice it when I took a shower. I went to the doc the next day. After examining me she said normally they are not allowed to refer someone of my age, I would have to wait a month and if it was still there go bk and get refered then. However she said in my case she wanted to do an urgent referal right away! Now I'm really anxious! I know I'm young so the odds r in my favor, but I'm really worried now! Any other young women had lumps on here?",

      "Content": "Sorry u have to have a core topsy, they sound bad :-( hoping its all ok for u, at least they are covering all bases and u will know soon. I haven't heard anything yet, doc said they could well push ny referral to the bk of the Que because of my age. I bet I don't get an appointment for weeks :-( I'm so stressed out with the waiting! What is Ur lump like out of interest? Mine is about egg size and feels very irregular/ strangely shaped and hard. It doesn't hurt unless my son elbows me lol. My nipple has started to get v sensitive tho. Hope I hear soon the wait is driving me crazy ! At least in afew days u will have Ur answer. Hope its good news! Xx",
