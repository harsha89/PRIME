    "Content": "I am a 53 years old and have always had normal mammograms! I went January 24, 2013 for a routine mammogram and Saturday, I get a letter from the radiologist with news that I need to contact my doctor within 2 weeks about the results, naturally I call first thing Monday morning and have been told that I need a spot compression on my left breast and an ultrasound on my right breast! I have been researching like crazy since then and it seems that 80-85% of these call backs are normal and rarely have a cancer diagnosis. So, I don't need to scare myself silly, but why is my stomach doing flips?? Anyway, the doctor got me an appointment for this Thursday, the 31st. I am praying for good outcomes and I really do appreciate others (you) sharing your stories.",
