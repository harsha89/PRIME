At first it kind of had a \"hot\" feeling, about two weeks later it started began to hurt when I would touch it. When in doubt, have it checked out",

As for the calcifications, if you are worried please make an appointment to have a mammogram. If you are younger than 40 your doctor can get you an appointment that should be covered by insurance.",

      "Content": "I hope I can offer some good news for you. I am a young two time breast cancer survivor. The odds were not in my favor but I am now almost 5 years past my first diagnosis. I also had an aggressive type and my oncologist told me that chemotherapy works best on aggressive tumors because chemo kills rapidly dividing cells, in which agressive tumors are rapidly dividing \"bad\" cells. That's why you loose your hair, have low blood counts, ulcers, etc... because each cell in your body goes through a life cycle, and the chemo effects those that are rapidly dividing. Trust me, I hated the chemo but I am still here and happy.",
