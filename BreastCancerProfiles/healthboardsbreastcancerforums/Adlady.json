    "Content": "I have a red bump (size of pencil eraser head) on my breast about 1 1/2\" under nipple area. Thin red line partial ring on one side. Thicken skin from bump to partial ring. Seems to have a thin red line starting to go up towards the nipple. No itching, no pain, just there. Bump been there for a couple of weeks. Thought bite, but never itched. Now changed as described. Sat and concerned. Heard about Hyperlasia, cysts, etc and signs of breast cancer popped into my head. Anyone know anything about what I am describing?",
