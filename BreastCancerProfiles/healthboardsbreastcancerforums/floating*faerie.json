    "Content": "Hi there. I actually found a little lump/knot in my right armpit just this morning! Actually, I noticed I had a large bump there about a month ago while I was shaving there...I just figured it was razor rash or something (sensitive skin)....but the visible bump is gone now and I happened to feel there today and I felt a lump or knot \"inside\". *Sigh* I really hope it's nothing serious. Take care, jennifer",
