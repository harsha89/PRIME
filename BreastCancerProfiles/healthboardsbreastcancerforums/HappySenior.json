    "Content": "I am not selling anything for anyone...this is what I did to get well..... Dr.Lorraine Day, you can enter her name into google and learn a lot. I had breast cancer and had the lump removed and they didnt get all the margin. They wanted to remove both breasts and give me chemo and radiation. I refused and decided to rebuild my immune system, detoxing and then all raw foods and fruits and veg.s and trust in God. I also take a lot of supplements. Well, first cancer margin line was 52 then 46 and now it is 34 and that is in a normal range!!!!",
