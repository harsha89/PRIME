      "Content": "I had a similar experience, a so-called \"structural asymmetry and architectural distortion\". They saw an area that looked like a structural change in one breast but not the other. They called me back for a diagnostic mammo, spot compression views. With spot compression the suspicious area spread out and convinced them that the previous finding was tissue overlap. The spot compression hurt some, it helped to have taken some ibuprofen half an hour before the test. Do keep your appointment and get this cleared up, but there is no need to panic. There is a good chance it is nothing serious. Good luck and let us know how it goes. With diagnostic mammos they tell you on the spot what category (BIRADS) your mammo was in. Hugs.",

      "Content": "Have you had any exams? A physical, a mammo, a ductogram? There are of course benign conditions (e.g. benign cysts) that can cause this kind of discharge, sometimes for up to 5 years. Bilateral discharge, as in your case, is less suspicious. Also, blue/greenish discharge is mostly due to benign cysts. Things get trickier when the discharge looks pink or rusty, as this means blood in the discharge and possible cancer. What did the drs base their diagnosis of non-cancer on?",

Also ElenaK, thanks for the suggestion that I take some Iboprophen ahead of time. I believe that it helped. Only one of the compressions was really uncomfortable. I appreciate the two posts. Thanks for caring. Congratulations!!! I am so happy for you!!!! I have been through the exact same experience and I know how hellish it is to wait and wonder if you have cancer... They did a third full-view one on me too... not half as painful as the spot compression. They do have to put a lot of pressure to make sure if something is there or just overlapping tissue. Take care!",

      "Content": "I got the same call a few months ago and was terrified!!! It turned out that it was a false positive, i.e. there was tissue overlap in the left breast and the machine picked it up as a shadow. These false positives are very common, especially if you are under 40 and the breast tissue is quite dense. My referral slip also had mammo w/ ultrasound. They did the mammo first (spot compressions, kind of painful...) and when they saw that the suspicious area spread out with localised pressure (ouch!), they skipped the ultrasound and asked me to come back in a year or two. Try to relax, there is a very good chance that you are being called back because of a false positive. Do let us know how things turn out.",

      "Content": "Hi Lynne, I have no personal experience with this, but I know 3 women of 3 different age groups that have had fibrocystic disease all their lives and have not developed cancer. As far as I know, it is something that needs to be monitored in case it changes into cancer, but it is NOT cancerous. One in two premenopausal women have it. Many drs do not even call it a disease, but a \"condition\", because it is not a sickness but just a nuisance. Your doctor can tell if it is a cyst during your physical. I am not sure if a mammogram would be a good idea, esp. since fibrocystic tissue may cover up possible cancers. Since you are way under 40, chances are your mammogram will turn out false positive (been there...) because the tissue is very dense and overlaps and creates \"artifacts\", i.e. shadows on the film. If I were you, for my peace of mind, I would ask for an ultrasound, which is the most appropriate test for 3-D objects and painless. To make ABSOLUTELY sure, they may do a cyst aspiration: they draw fluid from the cyst and perform a biopsy. The biopsy will give you 100% certainty that the cyst is benign. And you are spared the radiation of the mammo. As you have no history of cancer in your family, there is no reason why you should start mammos before you turn 40. Caffeine does have a weird effect on breast sensitivity. Even mammograms can be more uncomfortable or downright painful (been there too...) if you have had a lot of coffee. But then again you can control that and reduce your discomfort. Take care of yourself and don't worry.",

Any replies would be appreciated! Hi there, I have no personal experience, but a very close friend of mine has had it. Her mammos kept coming back clear and there was no palpable mass, but she noticed some bloody discharge from the nipple. Also, the areola skin was scaly and itchy. She had an MRI and was diagnosed with Paget's breast cancer. She underwent a mastectomy and has been doing well since. I hope I helped some.",
