      "Content": "Hello Dee. Just read your post and very interested and wonder would you mind telling me when they feel something under the arm and are going to do a biopsy could it be other than cancer? I was called back this week and had a second Mammo. and Ultra. but they would not do the Biopsys two somethings in breast and something under the arm pit same breast because I have a pacemaker and on blood thinners so having it doen tomorrow Friday and VERY lucky to get in before Christmas when they close for a couple of weeks. I have been on Hormone Replacement for nearly 27 years (yes I know I know) but my quality of life would be terrible without it but maybe now I may not have a life I do hope so though Thanks for reading. Locket.",
