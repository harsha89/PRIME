      "Content": "THANX, SUE...that is certainly good news re; the statistics. My first two mammos. came back abnormal with a mass on my right breast..had to get \"re-smushed_ both times and come to find out it was just me and my gals hanging out having apple martinis or something. Last year...totally normal.. I was going to wait another yr. before I had another mammogram and my breasts are normally kind of lumpy, but this particular one is hard and it hurts like the dickens. Plus if I move a certain way it burns! I tried to attribute it to PMS, but I'm all 'cleaned out' down in my nether region now. And my doctor's office still hasn't returned my call. Not too cool. But it's probably nothing. I tend to not trust doctors anyway. Especially when I call with a potentially serious something and his office won't return my call. HEY! I let him remove my ovaries! Pay attention to me!!! Since my insurance paid him a ton of money for the surgery, am I not worth his attention anymore meh. Guess I'll just let it slide and see what happens. I don't have an internist, just a primary care doc who'll refer me to my gyno. More time wasted. So again, I'll just let it go for now and ope the pain dissipates. That's what the insurance company would love me to do, anyway. Lord knows I'm sooo beholding to them. Sorry I just vented, but I hate it when people don't have the courtesy to return my call...especially when it comes to health issues. I was diagnosed with Epilepsy 5 yrs. ago and I know for a fact if my seizures cluster and I leave a message with my neurologist, he'll call back immediately or email me. He even called me on Thanksgiving to see how was doing while I was hospitalized during a VEEG. (video monitored EEG) This behavior from the gyno. office is just unacceptable. And I know it's not from him--it's the receptionist and his nurse. Well, he'll be getting an earful about them from me if I can ever get in touch with him, or if decide to even try, or just ignore my painful breast. It's probably nothing. So my grandmother died from breast cancer. Doesn't mean I will! right? But thanks again for your response, Sue. It's much appreciated. I hope everyone is doing well.",

      "Content": "Oh, and there re now blood dots in my bra. Can nipples menstruate? (I kid, of course.) Still no word from his office. I'm not going to call . . . am awaiting word from his office and am writing down the amount of time it has taken before his office returns my calls or IF they ever do call. (this all started in October. I'll just wait for more lovely symptoms to appear. As mentioned, the pain has recently abated, except for the burning sensation. After Jan.1st, my hubands insurance co. changes yet again, so who knows what I should do at this point? The blood is coming from the other breast of concern now. UGH! grrrrrr.",

      "Content": "I came here looking for advice but it seems pretty slow...but not as bad as my OBGYN's office! I called at 9 a.m. this morning and said I noticed a lump on my breast after doing a self-exam because something was very painful on my right breast. They said someone would get back to me. Crickets chirping. So much for Breast Cancer Awareness month.",

      "Content": "Thanx to all. I waited a few more weeks and called his office again. November 11th. Spoke with another receptionist, and related my concerns in regards to the lack of communication in their office. She said, \"Well, you need to see the doctor and have some bloodwork.\" I said Noooo, I don't. I just want a mammogram. Yesterday I received a $600 bill for bloodwork done at DUKE that my epileptologist had ordered (he's my brain doctor) to see how much damage these blooming anti-epilepsy meds are destroying my organs...and I'm not paying that again. I JUST WANT A MAMMOGRAM! She told me she would call Maria Parham (the local hospital) \"right away.\" Still no word. But, the pain has abated finally so I'm just going to give up. However, I've already composed a nice letter for my gyno. I don't blame him. I blame his office staff. Guess if my breast falls off, I'll attempt to get through to him again. P.S.--there are only about 3 GYNOS in this one horse town. Thanks again for replying. I wish we never moved here. Best wishes to all.",
