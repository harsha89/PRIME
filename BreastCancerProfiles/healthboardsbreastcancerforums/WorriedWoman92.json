    "Content": ". Hi, I'm 21 years old and I've had menstrual spotting for the last two weeks or so. However, yesterday as I was lying down I felt a pain in my breast. I've had tenderness leading up to my period before but never in only one breast and now there seems to be an area that is pinkish. My nipple doesn't look any different but both my left and right nipple are sensitive. Only the one spot hurts but it's kind of a shooting pain sometimes. Could this be cancer? Or related to my period?",
