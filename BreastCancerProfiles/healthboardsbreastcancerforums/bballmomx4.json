      "Content": "I'm 50 years old, have had my mammogram every year without fail until 2017. I've been told i have dense breasts but have never been called back. I was going through some family drama and put myself on the back burner and skipped a year. I just had my mammogram and was called back. They said it was due to focal Asymmetry. I failed the soft compression and had an ultrasound. They saw absolutely nothing in the ultrasound and told me to come back in six months. No way am I going to wait six months just to find out I have cancer. I have an appt. with a breast surgeon on Feb. 16. Am I totally overreacting?",
