    "Content": "The good news is most breast lumps are non-cancerous. Six years ago my wife ask me to feel the lump she found in her breast. Didn't hurt her, but the dog scratched her there and she felt the lump by accident. Good thing, it was cancerous and needed immediate attention. What I felt was a leather mass with rough edges. If this is what you feel, then you need to be concerned. Follow the doctors advice, in any case, and get as educated as possible. Understanding takes the fear out of the unknown. Good luck.",
