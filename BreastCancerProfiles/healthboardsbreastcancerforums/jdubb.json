    "Content": "My mother was just re-diagnosed with breast cancer... however, this time we are dealing with a situation similar to yours, BC in the liver and bones. I am on this site looking for answers myself, but this is what we have heard from doctors. Yes, there is a chance for remission. Remission forever? Probably not, but if the chemo works, it can add years onto someone's life. The doctors are also keeping us positive by reminding us of the advances in today's medicine. One of the postings stated that back when their loved one had cancer there was no chemo... well, look where medicine and treatment for BC is today. In a few years, who knows... Good luck to you and please let me know if you hear of anything else, preferrably positive news.",
