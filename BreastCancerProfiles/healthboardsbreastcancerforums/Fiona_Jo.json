      "Content": "I have fibrocystic breast and seem to always find lumps especially during my menstral cycle. But, I have always been cautious to have regular mammograms (even diagnostic at times), just be sure. I think with something like this a woman can't be too cautious. If your girlfriend hasn't; please be sure she schedules a mammogram (just to be safe). Recently, I found a swollen lymph node .. right armpit and now a small lump -- right breast (that didn't go away after menstruation). I am hoping it is nothing; my Doctor did presribe a strong course of antibiotics which unfortunately didn't help. But I will be having a diagnositic mammogram next week. Wish me luck!! Your girlfriend is in my thoughts. Jo",

I have fibrocystic breasts and it seems like I am constantly having comprehensive mammograms and Ultrasounds. I have breast cancer in my family and I just don't feel we can be too careful. I'm so happy to hear your good news! Jo",
