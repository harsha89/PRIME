    "Content": "I have lumps with pain in my right breast and now its moving into the armpit as well as causing numbing and dull heavy aching down my right arm I have had a needle biopsy and ultrasounds as well as a MRI with contrast the only answer they keep giving me is dense breast tissue. The pain has gotten to the point its effecting my life cause Im so frustrated. Ive gone to 3 dr's and they havent done anything they dont want to treat the pain with pain medication cause I havent met a dr yet that will prescribe pain meds for treatment but yet they have no plan for treatment for this. So I guess we just suffer in pain. . I have been going through this for over a year now. I have read that dense breast tissue can lead to more aggressive breast cancers my mother has been diagnossed with breast cancer so I guess in my case its just sit in pain till it becomes breast cancer then they will treat it? I dont know what to do but recently I have been refered to a pain clinic and the dr there believes the lumps in my breast are putting pressure on certain nerves that run down my arm she has tried me on a nerve blicker says if that relieves any of the discomfort in the arm that she will be sending me to a nueroligist but my question is has anyone gone through this and after I do go to the nuerologist and they say yes thats whats happening then what do I do next. wait till its becomes cancer then remove it???????????????",
