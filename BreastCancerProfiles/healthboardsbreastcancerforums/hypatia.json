    "Content": "I've had a small, hard lump under the nipple for over 10 years. When I first noticed it, i went running to the dr. who assured me it was no big deal--but that every lump should be checked . When I get a mammogram every year, it's never mentioned. That said, even young women your age do get breast cancer, so it's good you are going to a medical professional. If she recommends you see a doctor, please please follow through. (and squeezing it is not good)",
