    "Content": "Good for you for standing up for what you wanted! You wouldn't have been happy if you would have settled for chemo or radition. You are very lucky to have such a supportive husband and family. Your treatment option may not be for everyone but I'm glad it's been successful for you. My best wishes to you. p.s. I think you should write the book because I think it will make you happy! Go for it!",
