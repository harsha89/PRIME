    "Content": "hi i found a lump on my right breast in early Sept, and right away i suspected it was a cyst (although the biggest one i have ever had!) it is round, rubbery and moves freely the doctor send me for a mammogram and an ultrasound i opted to go for the ultrasound, as i was afriad the mammogram would burst the cyst (don't laugh, it happened when i was 20) so it was confirmed that it is a cyst, one of many BUT the tech called the radiologist in to check on something else she found, in another place (an area i noticed back in Feb but passed off as being too tiny to be anything significant) now they are mad that i did not have the mammogram first and told me to go get one why? if they know something is there that is not a cyst, why go back and do a mammogram? why not do a biopsy if it is not normal? i am confused and scared- but i don't know if there is any reason for me to be scared should i insist on a copy of the ultrasound report? any input appreciated! thanks",
