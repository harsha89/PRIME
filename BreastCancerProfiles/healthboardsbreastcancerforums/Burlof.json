The Surgeon said it didn't look anything sinister to him and appeared normal breast tissue which had formed a lump, just need to confirm with the pathology department. Thank-you Michelle",

      "Content": "Hi, I'm 30 years old. Several months ago (6 months) I discovered a lump in my left upper breast. I had stopped Breastfeeding about 7 months prior. I went to the Dr immediately and they organised an ultrasound and mamogram, both of which were clear. I was referred to a specialist as a precaution and she was 99% sure it was just a fatty lump. I have seen her several times and at last visit the lump was slightly more noticable. Prior to this I could only feel it in the shower. Anyway, she did a needle test, the results of which came back benign and showing only fatty substance but the test considered technically invalid because their were no milk duct valves present?? but she said if it was just a fatty lump you wouldn't expect to find this so it was a catch 22 situation. Anyway she said to monitor and see me in 3 months. Well I had bad bad bruising from the needle test she did and my lump went from being pea size to golf ball size (definately NOT an exageration). I didn't call her strait away coz she warned me about bad bruising and I figured sticking a needle in the lump would cause swelling etc. Well the lump went down in size but is still rather large, say Cool Mint size and definately detectable at any time (not just in shower anymore). I went back this week to see her (3.5 weeks after needle test) and she said she would of expected the swelling to of gone down and best to have it removed to be safe and has put me on the waiting list. She said the needle test wouldn't of made the lump bigger, that she thinks I have either just bruising, fatnerusin (sp???) having trouble reading her writing on the paper she gave me .. or looks like.. me primet ... gosh I wish Doctors would learn to write before they learnt to slice people open. LOL. Can anyone make sense of this? She assured me the needle test was 95% accurate that the lump was cancer free but the fact it was \"technically invalid\" makes me kinda worried. Any opinions on my situation? Michelle",
