    "Content": "I've noticed a large lump in my right armpit for the last couple of months. It was never there before. I've checked and there isn't one on the left side, so I don't think it's just normal anatomy. The lump is not painful, but it is getting larger. In fact, I can even see it when I raise my arm. My main concern is that I just went through treatment for cervical cancer a few months ago, and new lumps or bumps worry me. However, I had a doctors appointment a couple of weeks ago, and when I mentioned it, the doctor (PCP) checked but said he couldn't feel anything. So, am I just nuts or is he? What should I do? I have an appointment with my oncologist for a follow-up next month. Should I just wait and mention it to him if it's still there?",
