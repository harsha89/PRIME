    "Content": "M grandmother had breast cancer when she was 35 and was informed then that there was a risk that is may be genetic. There are 4 duaghters and 6 grand-duaghters who have all been told that if it is genetic, we should all get checked out having a mammogram at the age of 25. The gene is more dominent in females so if a grandmother has had it there is an 60% chance it has been passed down. 4 days ago we had the news that my aunt had a lump in her breast but luckily it turned out to be benine. We have been informed since that as it was benine the chances of the gene being passed onto the rest of us has now been reduced to a 25% chance. There was news yesterday that there is a new mammogram that has replaced the standard one. To be honest i would rather go regularly and have a mammogram than be at higher risk. In terms of the letter.....they have to cover themselves and to be honest as my grandmother always says...\"better to be say than sorry!\" Try not to worry about it too much. I have found another health chat website that i found really informative, its new but everyone on it is really chatty and helpful. It called patients talking and is a dot com. Seriously i recommend it, i'm not trying to promote it, but as i said, everyone is really chatty and helpful no matter what the situation is and the best bit is....ITS FREE!!!!",
