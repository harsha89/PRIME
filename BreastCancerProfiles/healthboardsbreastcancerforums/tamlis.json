      "Content": "I had a mammogram last week and my doctor called and said I have new multiple linear heterogeneous calcifications in my left breast. I am now having a spot compression test done tomorrow. Is this anything to be concerned about? Why wouldnt I just have a ultrasound? I have not had pain and breast cancer doesnt run in my family. I am postmenopausal. Thanks",

      "Content": "Thanks for all your responses I finally received the final report from my spot compression test which said that there were a group of slightly heterogeneous and pleomorphic calcifications in the upper lateral breast and a second group of more punctate diffuse calcifications in the lower medial breast. In light of the heterogenous appearance of the upper outer calcifications, further evaluation of core biopsy is recommended. The impression was Left Breast: Suspicious/Category 4A. But when I went for my biopsy today, the radiologist doing the needle wire insertion wnet ahead and did it then said she thought I should have the lower breast marked and took it out and marked the lower breast. My surgeon removed the tissue from the lower breast. (I had it surgically removed) #1 what is Suspicious/Category 4A? #2 should I be worried about them excising the lower instead of the upper as suggested by the other radiologist? #3 what does heterogenous and pleomorphic mean? what about punctate and diffuse? I'm really concerned about this mix up. Does this happen often? (They say it was mis-marked-upper when it should have been lower)? Thanks for your help I hope I haven't been too confusing...I'm really stressed",

      "Content": "Thanks ellemae for the info. I am back from my 2 hour spot compression test , which the radiologist has decided I need a biopsy. I was told I would have a Stereotactic Needle Core Biopsy. I am having this done at the same place I had my mammogram with the radiologist doing the biopsy. My sister and Mom has had biopsies and had a surgeon do theirs. Is there a difference? How long does it take to get results? Also the nurse was asking me if I ever had cancer anywhere before and I remembered about 10 years ago or so I had a couple of suspicious paps and had 2 different cone biopsies on my cervix which I was told I had Class III cervical dyspalgia (isnt that the one that is in situ?) Do you think this could be related to my cervical abnormalities? Sorry I hope Im making sense. Thanks for all your help.",

      "Content": "Thanks ellemae. This was compared to my mammogram I had 2 years ago and I cant remember any accident in between there..... Oh, whats the difference if you have it biopsed surgically? The nurse had talked about that option, something about inserting a metal wire and then having the spot biopsed. That sounded bad too. The only reason they discussed this with me is I have knee problems and they were concerned about me getting up the steps, but I also have neck problems concerning disk surgery I had last year and am afraid I woun't be able to lay on my stomach for very long (nurse said about 30 minutes) She said I could take some pain killers before I came. Do you know anything about this kind of procedure? Whats the benefits? Thanks again",
