      "Content": "The breast should feel like a bunch of grapes in texture when you are close to having your menstrual cycle, so that might be what she is feeling. If she feels lump to be different in texture and hardness than the rest of the breast (say like a peanut in the middle of oatmeal) that she should go get that checked out. If it is a visible deformity; it would be wise to go and see a doctor regardless of the texture. there are such things as breast cysts. They can be along the surface of the breast as well as nuzzled in the breast tissue. If it is a cyst, your doctor might notice that the bump would move around and change in size during her period. But breasts cysts are more common in older women And before you freak out- it is very unlikely that it is cancerous as its very rare for young women to develop breast cancer. Or it might be whats called a breast fibroadenoma, which is just a cluster of benign (harmless) cells that support other cells in the breast. They are made of fibrous and glandular tissues. These can be hard or firm and it can be move around during breast exam. This is something that usually affects younger women and teens.",
