      "Content": "Hi Kathryn, Yes, I've had the same experience. This happened several times to me and each time I was beyond myself as I have an anxiety disorder. Try not to let it get to you as I did. In may case it turned out to be cystic disease. Most breast lumps are benign. I know several women who had the same thing, benign fibrocystic disease. Just get the tests done and you'll do just fine. God bless.",

      "Content": "Breast cancer doesn't automatically mean chemo or radiation. My sister-in-law is having 2 malignant tumors in a breast removed a week from tomorrow. Her surgeon said she will not need either one, chemo or radiation. They will remove 3 lymph nodes just to stay on the safe side. The tumors are contained. Every woman I know, including myself!, who have found a lump automatically believe \"THIS IS THE ONE!\" We just know that it's cancer, yet, 90% of lumps are benign. It's just a 'woman thing.' LOL! My friend's doctor/radiologist missed a lump during a mamogram and 3 years later found a golf ball size malignant tumor. This was 9 years ago! Medicine has come a long ways and breast cancer no automatically mean death, chemo, radiation, etc. So think positive, pray, and know that you are not alone. God bless.",
