      "Content": "I am 62 years old, after my recent yearly mammogram I received an immediate email notice that an asymmetry in my right breast central to the nipple anterior depth had been identified and it is now recommended that I have mediolateral and compression views as well as a ultrasound. Can you explain what this means, should I be concerned that this may be cancer since it has appeared so quickly?",

      "Content": "Today was the day I went for my follow-up mammogram at Cleveland Clinic....I was hoping my concerns and fears would have been put to rest when I walked out of there, but, not the case. The tech doing my exam had my films from 3 weeks ago hanging up, which clearly showed the asymmetry form in my right breast; after completing the first 2 new ones, she jokingly said...\"they're gone\"...I don't see them there anymore. I mentioned to her that if she was doing the compression films now, the ones I had 3 weeks ago were much more painful than what she was doing, she continued to do a 3rd. She took the films to the radiologist who quickly refused them, she was on the same page as I was; she then requested that they be repeated before I left. The tech took two more views, which did show the same images as were originally seen, however they were not as defined, I believe that she convinced the radiologist that everything was fine. Once I had a chance to look over my paperwork I noticed that the exact description of the mammogram I had 3 weeks ago was printed on the sticker for today, so I called before leaving to ask if there could have been a mix-up on which tests were performed since I was supposed to have been coming in for the mediolateral, compression and ultra sound, we never made it to the ultra sound. The lady on the other end of the phone said she was almost certain that everything had been done as it should have. I'm left wondering and worrying now what to do, I know the asymmetry is still there, do I explain the situation to my Primary Care Dr. and see if he'll go ahead and order the ultra sound?",

      "Content": "My procedures will be done at the Women's Health Center at the Cleveland Clinic, they've notified me that it should take about 90 minutes. I read that as we get older our breast tissue changes from fiberous or dense to fatty, making the mammogram images much easier to read. If, for the majority of my life I've had fiberous/dense breasts and now through the life process they have become fatty and more transparent allowing this asymmetry to be seen that throws up a huge red flag for me. In 2008 I was involved in a head-on collision, while at the Trauma Unit they did a complete body CT & MRI after which they informed me that I had lesions in my pancreas. In 2003 I had to have a colon resection, before which I had a CT & MRI of my pancreas, the radiologist did his job, in his report he noted the lesions and recommended that my surgeon forward me on for further evaluation, that however never happened, I was never aware for 5 years that anything was wrong until I read the reports myself after picking them up to take to Cleveland Clinic for a second opinion.",

      "Content": "Thank you so much for the info. I have an appointment this coming Tuesday; will they do all the tests at one time, or will I be doing one at a time? I've always been told that I had dense fiberous breasts, this time, they've said predominently fatty, just seems like everything has changed so quickly.",

      "Content": "I couldn't agree more as far as being in the perfect place at the Cleveland Clinic. I am very lucky as far as what is going on with my pancreas, I was going every 6 mos for biopsies, then they changed it to MRI's, I wanted a 2nd opinion about that, that is how i originally ended up at Cleveland Clinic. The Dr. I have there now has assured me that even though the number of lesions have increased, there is no significant change in their appearance, therefore he is recommending that I only go once a year now for the MRI. My mediolateral and compression are scheduled for this coming Tuesday (6-12-12); not sure about the ultrasound, they had mentioned to allow 90 minutes for the visit, so I'm not sure if they'll do all of them then. My sister will be making the 3 hour trip with me, I had asked my daughters, but unfortunately they both have jobs that won't let them go this time.",

      "Content": "The lesions in my pancreas are IPMN's (Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms), one or more seem to be communicating with the Main Duct. When I was first told about them in the Trauma Unit in 2008 the Dr. said they had seen 5; the last count was around 17-19 now after three and a half years.",
