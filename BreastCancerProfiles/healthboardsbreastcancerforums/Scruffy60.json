      "Content": "I had a mammogram and ultrasound done today, the radiologist said he saw something on the mammogram that has been there for the last several years but it just jumped out at him today and he said he's overly cautious that's why the ultrasound, then he said I'm probably just chasing a shadow , but I would feel better if you would have a MRI done, or come back in 6 months for another ultrasound. I have very dense breast, so who knows, I think each radiologist just interprets differently",

      "Content": "A month ago I had my yearly mammogram and then a ultra sound, the Dr said there's something there that has been there on previous mammys but it stood out to him more this time, said there's nothing to worry about, but he would like to do another ultrasound in 6 months, I went and saw a general surgeon who also did an exam and was not concerned with the ultrasound, just says to follow up in 6 months. So now I am experiencing some stingy sort of pain in that breast, just curious is this a concern for some sort of cancer, or what? I am in peri menopause so my hormones are all over the place, so not sure if that is what's playing the part, but it's only in the one breast, would love to hear from anyone with similar experiences!",

      "Content": "I\u0092m another one! Dense breast is something a lot of us deal with, same thing for me on several occasions I get the call to come back in for another mamogram, the last time they ordered A ultrasound, the doctor told me he was probably chasing a shadow but wanted to be sure so he told me to either get an MRI or come back in six months for another ultrasound I chose the ultrasound and again in six months it was nothing, so please try not to worry this is so common with women with dense breasts! I hope this helps you because I do know that absolute fear and stress this causes even though I know to expect it. Praying all goes well with you! Please let us know how things turn out",
