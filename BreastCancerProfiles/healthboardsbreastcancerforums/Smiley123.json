    "Content": "I had a mammogram and ultrasound done but did not have a MRI. I had my lumps removed just so I would know that it was ok or not. My dr took them out in the office. He deadened the area and took them out and they were not cancer. Thank GOD!!! It was not that bad during but afterwards I have had some pain with the cut. I'm having to take some antibiotics because of an infection but it is better than being worried that it is cancer. Hope this helps. Good Luck, Smiley123",
