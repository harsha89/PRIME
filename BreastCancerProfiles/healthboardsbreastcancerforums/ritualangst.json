      "Content": "as a two time breast cancer survivor i do know \"round\" and \"well defined\" are both good things you want to see on your report- also \"fatty\" and \"fibroglandular\" don't send up too many red flags BUT- and with breast cancer there is always a BUT- any mammogram that shows something suspicious does indeed need a follow up- i believe the poster mentioned a breast ultra sound and this is a good start- a test with more definition is a breast MRI but that is not ususally done unless they see something of concern on the ultra sound so you need to take it one minute at a time- one day at a time and if needed one week at a time- do not get ahead of yourself on the fear factor- if you post here often keep us updated on the results and it you need a biopsy i can offer alot of advice about that as well- remember- everyone's cancer journey is totally different- do not compare what happenend to one person to what is happening to you - **********-",

      "Content": "i would get a second opinion before starting any treatment ~ i have been diagnosed with breast cancer twice ~ first time in 04 with invasive lobular carcinoma for which i had a lumpectomy and 6 weeks of radiation and started on an AI then in 05 for DCIS which i had another lumpectomy and 6 more weeks of radiation ~ i made sure i had two MD's give me my diagnosis and they both came up with the same conclusion ~ stage III is no longer a death sentence with all of the new treatment protocols they have and if you feel the least bit apprehensive about your oncologist find a new one ~as a two time survivor i can tell you 90% of the battle is emotional and if you do not feel the inner strength you need to feel with this doctor then move on ~ lots of good information on the internet so do your research ~i have reached my 5 year mark so there is always hope ~ keep the faith ~",

      "Content": "i am a two time breast cancer survivor who is hormone receptor positive- this means my tumor was fueled by estrogen and the treatment protocol for my kind of cancer is a lumpectomy or mastectomy (depending on tumor size) mine was 0.9 cms so i had a lumpectomy- chemo is also considered but with a tumor below 1.0 chemo was not recommended (fine by me)- with the smaller tumor and no lymph node involvment radiation is a must so i had 6 weeks of treatments with a \"boost\" at the end then was started on arimidex- i will reach my 5 year mark of arimidex in january of 2010 and will see what my oncologist suggests after that because the new studies are indicating 10 years of arimidex may be beneficial to hormone receptor positive cancer ( i cannot even go there thinking about 5 more years of arimidex but that is a totally different story) however hormone receptor negative breast cancer is treated in a completely different way and i know we are not allowed to post any other websites on these boards and i respect that but may i say DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH- there is SO much information out there for you about your type of cancer so please- learn as much as you possibly can- **********-",

      "Content": "as a two time breast cancer survivor i would do all i could to get that MRI- often if your surgeon will call the insurance company and plead his case they will approve it- that may be an option and i do not want to scare you but finding an area that \"is not well defined\" can be a bit more alarming to a radiologist or physician that an area that is well formed can be- PLEASE DO NOT LET THAT WORRY YOU- I AM NOT A DOCTOR!! i am just offering my opinion having been through this twice- and why didn't the doctor take a tissue sample when he was there? it is a simple process and you would already have an answer by now- keep bugging someone until you get the answers you need and deserve- never give up-",

      "Content": "yes i have had the dye 3 times- first for a full body MRI after my car was totaled- then for the breast cancer and then an MRI of the brain for vertigo- it is not bad- it gives you a flushed feeling then it's gone- they do have a long list of things you cannot be allergic to so make sure they go over that with you before you consider agreeing to it- they can do the MRI without it however the doctors always insist they can see the images better with the dye- very rarely do people have any kind of reaction to it- i live in florida also- if you have any more questions you can PM if you would like-",
