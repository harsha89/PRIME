    "Content": "Hi Aims - I just noticed your post and wondered if your period has come yet, or the lumpy feeling gone away? Reason I ask is that I also thought I felt a lump in my left armpit last night and I'm two days away from my period. I have fairly large breasts and both my grandmothers had breast cancer so I'm not sure if I'm being overly paranoid right now or if it's something I should see the doc about. How old are you, if you dont mind me asking? Is there a history of breast cancer in your family? I'm 35 and currently trying for a baby, so feeling pretty scared right now.",
