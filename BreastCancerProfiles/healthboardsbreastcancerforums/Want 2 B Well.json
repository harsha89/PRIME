      "Content": "Hi, I am posting here becuase I thought someone here might have some experience here. I have a lump inside the back lip of my vagina. Do not be confused, it is not an exterior lump, it is inside. I discovered the lump a couple of weeks ago while taking a shower. (I immediately made and appt. with my OBGYN...Wed Oct 22nd at 10:30am) Since then I believe it is growing, it is hard, big maybe the size of a ping pong ball, it does move, doesn't hurt, but I do feel \"pressure\" inside my vagina & lower area. Could it be a gland or something? Anyone ever have something like this?",
