    "Content": "Hi, My name is Lisa and I am 28, I was having a pain so I went to the Dr and they found a large lump in my breast toward the bottom against my chest wall. It is very hard and doesn't mover. I also have a small lump a little bigger than a pea right under the nipple on that side, my nipple has started to look kinda like the outside of an orange(the texture not the color). I already had early cervical cancer about 3 years ago so I am worried that this might be cancer as well. Has anyone else had something similar? I am scheduled for a mammogram and ultrasound on the 14th. Please share anything. Lisa",
