      "Content": "Hi - been reading your post and glad all came back normal for you. I had breast cancer in 2009 and my last mammogram about 2 weeks ago showed some calcification around the tumor site and now they want to do a MRI. She stressed calcifications are normal, but to be on safe side, let's do an MRI. Ugh, I hate going thru this.",

It's painless -- maybe a little sunburn feel - but very effective. It will destroy any cancerous cells around the tumor site. Good luck, pray and stay positive.",
