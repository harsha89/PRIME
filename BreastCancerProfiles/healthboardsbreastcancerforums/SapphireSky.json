    "Content": "I had surgery for breast cancer in April, and radiation in May/June. I am still experiencing some swelling and pain in my breast and wondering how long this is going to last!! It is not something that is alarming, just pretty annoying at this point. I realize that my body is still recovering from the radiation. I can't sleep on my right side at all, can't wear certain bras and need to \"hang on\" when going over bumps in the car. My radiation oncologist scheduled my follow-up visit and mammogram for the first of February, and today I contacted her to try to get it delayed (still waiting for a reply). I don't think I would be able to endure it at this point. It will hopefully be done more towards the 12-month mark instead of now. Anyway, any tips on how to deal with this would really be appreciated. I know my doctor will most likely have me come in to be examined after my call to her office, so I will get info from her, too......but sometimes it is nice to know what others have done.",
