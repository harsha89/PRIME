    "Content": "I had these lumps since i was like 12 years old. It used to hurt a little, but then the pain disappeared for 4 years and now it has started to hurt again. Sometimes it hurts around the chest, but then dissapears and then the pain comes back again. Sometimes when i squeeze it, i feel absolutely nothing and other days it really hurts. When the pain started i also started having lower back pains. I'm afraid if it's cancer then it might have already spread onto my spine. I also had pain just below my right ribs that lasted for a week, but now i don't feel anything anymore(yet) The lumps are under borth breasts, and both about 2,5cm. They're not hard, but not soft either. They're kinda oval shaped. Please give me some advice, is this cancer?? If so then in what stage is it, do i have chance of survival?",
