    "Content": "Hi everyone! I have come to the board bc I am absolutely horrified! About 3 or 4 months ago I noticed sore or sensitive breast around my menstrual cycle time and around ovulation....me and my fiance were trying to conceive so i kept track of symptoms in general. I took it as just a new symptom i was having before my cycles being that im 37. But then i noticed it would happen outside of my cycle/ovulation times. Sometimes I even brought pregnancy test thinking the soreness was a symptom. My cycles have been a little off too.....2 days late one month, a week early the next, spotting one day then stopping then full blown cycle beginning the next. Well about 2 weeks ago I noticed that not only this Burning, tingly sensation in both of my breast....they were not sore to touch! Which is puzzling the heck out of me. Because they feel so engorged and burning sensation that if touched I should be ready to punch the heck out of someone, but they mysteriously dont hurt to touch!?? So Ive been to the e.r. for the constant burning in both breast and Ive been to an obgyn....the obgyn has did a breast exam (no lumps, no visible redness, swelling, pitting like an orange, no nipple inversion, no nipple discharge...nothing) said breast look fine but sent me for a regular mammogram to make sure. Yesterday mammogram results came back...she said everything was fine...no areas of concern. Meanwhile, as I type my breast still have the burning, tingly sensation(not as bad so far today). I am worried about Inflammatory breast cancer, as I know a mammogram does not pick it up. Doctors feel that my breast show no signs of it, but I googled breast burning and it is a symptom. Am I losing it or what???!!! This is driving me crazy. I have an appt. With a breast specialist Jan. 2nd....the doctor scheduled it with this specialist bc she feels it is some sort of \"nerve\" condition affecting the breast and does not feel it is ibc. I have never heard of a nerve condition affecting both breast....but again....im no doctor. I just dont want them to be overlooking a serious disease such as ibc where time is of the essence. HELP PLEASE!!!!",
