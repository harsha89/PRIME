    "Content": "Over the past several days I have felt this click by my collarbone when I move a certain way. I've noticed what I can only describe as feeling like a muscle or tendon is \"clicking\". Not audibly but there's a slight pain and then it feels like it moves and the pain goes away. I've never had any neck pain really although I've had stiff necks on occasion like everyone else. This is different though. It's also not my neck clicking. I posted on the back boards thinking it was that. It's the weirdest sensation. It's only on the left side, I don't feel any tenderness when I press there and it's happened a handful of times. It's right around my collarbone. I posted here because I just caught a little bit of the Oprah show and they said something about breast tissue extending over the collarbone so I wanted to ask here. I have felt the area, like I said, with nothing abnormal. I have my yearly mammogram in June. I guess I should bring it up then unless maybe go in earlier? I'm almost 44, by the way. Thanks.",
