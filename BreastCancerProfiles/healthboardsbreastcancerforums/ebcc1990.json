    "Content": "I had a core biopsy yesterday. Mine was fast and pretty painless (small poke to numb the area). My situation is probably similar to others who've posted here...Routine mammo, called back for more slides and an ultrasound...found an area in the left breast that appears to be a fibroadenoma but they cannot say for sure without the biopsy. So, I've done everything they asked me to and now I sit here worrying and thinking of every worst case scenerio there could be! I should have results tomorrow but the stress is terrible! Anyone have a similar situation? I am 42 and feeling very old right now!!!",
