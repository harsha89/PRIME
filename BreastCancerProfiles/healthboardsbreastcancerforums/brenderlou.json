      "Content": "I have just recently noticed a change to my left nipple. When I change from work clothes and take off my bra the middle of my nipple is slightly indented while the rest of the nipple is normal (not indented). Once I take my bra off, it \"pops\" back to normal (for lack of a better word) so I only notice this when I just take off my bra. I am 46 yrs old and do have a gyn appt next week so will discuss w/ dr and go my yearly mammogram. Has anyone experienced this? Brenda",

      "Content": "Hi- I am 46 years old and while doing a self breast exam noticed a very small amount of discharge from both nipple when I squeezed them. The amount was like VERY small drops and a couple of the drops where milky while the others were clear and not sticky. I do not have any discharge other than when I squeezed. I've been a bad girl and haven't gone to the gyn in 3 yrs due to being busy with a 3 year old but made an appt for next week when I will also get an RX for a mammo so I'm a little nervous. I read on line that this is normal when squeezing niipples as the squeezing triggers the discharge......is this correct? Thanks Brenda",
