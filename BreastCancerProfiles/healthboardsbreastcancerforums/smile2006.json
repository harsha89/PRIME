    "Content": "I had my first mammogram done at 43 and was called back a second time. They found some microcalcifications that they wanted maganified views on since they had nothing to compare it to. After doing the magnified views they said the microcalcifications took the form of teacup shape of \"milk of calcium\". They want me to come back for another mammogram on that breast in 6 months just to verify that there is no change. If there is a change they will do a biopsy then. They told me not to worry and that six months is very short. If any change did occur, it is still very early in the game. I have read several things that support this in reading up on it. Like you, \"don't worry\" is easier said than done!",
