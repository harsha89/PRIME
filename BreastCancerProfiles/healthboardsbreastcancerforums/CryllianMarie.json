    "Content": "My mammo also did not show a mass nor did the ultrasound show anything, but I chose to have a biopsy and with your grandmother's history, if I were you, I would also have a biopsy. When they did my biopsy, they found a mass deep in the center of the breast that was malignant. Yours may be nothing, but the constant worry associated with waiting is ridiculous! Go ahead and have your biopsy and clear your mind one way or the other!",
