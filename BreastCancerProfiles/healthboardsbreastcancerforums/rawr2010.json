    "Content": "Hi... today as I was about to take a shower I noticed both of my breasts had red dark spider veins right by the areola. Both of them. And I have a light brown patches. My breasts also both have ingrown hair bumps (so they feel rough). I have rashes and I'm really scared I have large breasts... I'm 18 years old. I have thick green veins going through my areola as well. I'm currently only period right now and I'm terrified. Please help.",
