      "Content": "Hi, Suggi. Thank you for taking a minute to respond to my question. I/she/we just found out today and everyone is in shock. I just got more details. It is less than a .25 cm and is in stage one. The Radiologist saw something in the mamogram/ultrasound that no one else did. Doc says she has some decisions to make. I guess the options are massec (sp?) or lumpectomy (sp?), right? What is there to consider when deciding on one of these options? Whatever she chooses will be followed by some localized radiation. Should she be as scared to death as she is? Thanks again for your kind attention~~Jack",
