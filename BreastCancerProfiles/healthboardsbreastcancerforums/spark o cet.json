Breast tissue seems to take a long time to heal, I've noticed after injury so maybe it's similar in this case. I don't want to guess what it could be, but I hope your tests are soon so you can find out. Good luck and please let us know how it turns out. Even if it is the worst thing, you are catching it very early, I think. The reason most men don't do well if they have breast cancer is because they do nothing about a symptom and ignore it until a very long time has passed. You aren't doing that, so I think they odds are in your favor. THANKS for the reply,i agree it seems the t-shots had something to do with bringing this all on.i pray it is nothing.i will let you know how it comes out.",
