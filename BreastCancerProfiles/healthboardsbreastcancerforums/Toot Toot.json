    "Content": "I have had what you describe for about 8 years now. I've had a couple mammograms and an ultrasound to have it checked (the final mammogram being 4 years ago); I'm 38 now. What I was finally told is that it's likely an infected duct -- and nothing to worry about. I occasionally have a little bit of a shooting pain that goes through it, but that's all. I no longer worry about it; I just continually check for other lumps/areas of concern. Take care!",
