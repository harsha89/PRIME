    "Content": "Hi all, I was glad to find this thread since I am wondering if I have Paget's. I have several reddish-looking dry areas on one of my areolas; the nipple is OK. The spots burn a little but don't itch. I have been to a dermatologist and a general surgeon - both of whom say it is not Paget's. Tomorrow I go to my gyne. These tannish areas have a distinct border but the border does not necessarily follow the circle of the areola. At the bottom there is a small area that does go outside the areola maybe a fraction of an inch. If this is something serious, I want to catch it while it's still in the early stages. Since there is no nipple involvement, I'm wondering if it's Paget's. My dermatologist says it's some kind of eczema, but then if it is, why isn't it on both breasts? Any info will be much appreciated. Mindy",
