      "Content": "I had the same thing and radiation is a snap compared to the chemo. I had no real side affects except for as your Dr. said some mild burning which is like a sun burn and they will give you something for that. So rest assured the worst is over and you can now go on with your life. I did lose a few pounds during rads and that was a super plus. Take care.",

      "Content": "I assume you really want to know. I Have triple neg and I am now doing radiation. It means that her cancer is not hormone driven. It is the worse type of Breast Cancer b/c it seems to come back and spread. The only good thing about it is chemo works on it very well. It is the least studied of all breast Cancer but studies are now going on. It seems catching this Breast Cancer early is key. I had IDC triple neg. with 1 lymph node positive. If she had no positive lymph nodes her chances go way up. Just be there for your friend.",
