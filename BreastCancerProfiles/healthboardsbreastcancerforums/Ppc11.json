      "Content": "I found a huge oval lump in the right side of my left breast. It is bigger than an inch in length, and at least half an inch in width. It is very smooth, and moves around a lot when I push it. It seemed to appear out of nowhere overnight. It has been two months since I found it and it has not gone away or changed that I can tell. I am 24 years old, no known family history of breast cancer. I started the birth control pill about 6 months before I found this lump. I stopped about a month ago, the lump did not change. Don't know if that's related or not, but worth mentioning. I am also currently dealing with cervical cancer. I don't know much about this, and am very very scared. I'm actually nervous even about mentioning it to my doctor. I'm scared of a mammogram, I heard they hurt, I'm scared of hearing results that I do not want to hear. My battle with cervical cancer has been so horrible I just can't bear the thought of breast cancer too. What will they do when I tell my doctor? What is the mammogram, breast biopsy, anything else involved like? What does this lump sound like to you? Has anyone else had a similar experience? I really do appreciate any comments, stories, thoughts, anything. Thank you.",

I have small breasts and the idea of having 40 pounds (so I've read) of pressure squeezing them near flat hurts even to think about. Especially with this big lump inside... which hurts just to push on with my finger sometimes. I am really scared for this. Also, what is the experience of a breast biopsy like? I have only had cervical biopsies and I think they are horrible every time. Oh, one more question. I just read in this message board something about ultrasound vs. mammogram. I am obviously clueless but, is it possible to opt for ultrasound instead of mammogram to have this lump checked out?",
