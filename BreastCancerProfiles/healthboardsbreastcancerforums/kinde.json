    "Content": "I have been in severe pain since last Weds with pain in the left breast. I am 39 and on HRT because of hysterctomy 8 years ago. Pain is radiates in the whole breast but no lump. I went to doctor and they ordered mammogram. Tech said tissue was very dense and i have large breasts. It came back negative. I am taking ultratram and tylox for the pain but even then it is hardly tolerable. They have ordered an MRI tomorrow. Has anyone ever experienced this? I have never had this kind of pain. I do not understand how there can be no lump or mammogram evidence with this kind of pain. I appreciate anyones help",
