      "Content": "I just got back from my mammogram and ultra sound & it was a nightmare. I started getting more scared when the lady doing the mammogram came in and said they needed another picture of the right breast. When cancer was found 10 yrs. ago it was in the left breast. For about 3 yrs. before being diagnosed they started taking extra pictures, now it's starting with the right breast! My biopsy showed years ago I have lobular hyperplasia. This doesn't just go away evidently. My cancer wasn't lobular, but this hyperplasia stuff which means greater chance of returning, & even in the other breast, now is really freaking me out. The years since I had the cancer in the left breast there hasn't been any more let's get another picture routine, until today. They spent more time looking at the ultra sound on my right breast in an area I'm sure will be watched until they see cancer again. Now I'm convinced the exact same thing is starting to happen again but now in the right breast. I guess they decide to keep watching before doing a biopsy. That word alone freaks me out. The other years I've had my mammograms I celebrated afterwards & went out to eat and shopping smiling all the way. Today I just cried all the way home & don't want to go outside now. My mother died young at age 60 and I'm close to that age, I feel really depressed and wish I could celebrate being a 10 yr. survivor. I don't feel like a survivor because it's like I'm always waiting for the other shoe to drop. I'm exhausted from everything. On top of all this which is worse, my daughter will be going in this week to have a biopsy lumps in her neck. This of course bothers me and concerns me even over my current freak out with my right breast. Then it will be another two weeks to get the results from that. I fear because my mammogram experience didn't go well her experience won't go well. I pray that's not the case; I hate that she is having to be tortured at such a young age with this biopsy stuff, especially with her having my two young grandchildren who need their mother.",

      "Content": "They told me to come back next year, but I'm going to go to my onc. and talk with her about it. This has never happened before, except it started happening three years before i was diagnosed with B.C. in the other breast. They took the extra picture on the mammogram & the doctor said that one looked OK then, she said it looked different on the ultrasound though and that's scary. I never had ultrasounds before being diagnosed; it was found from the mammogram. The lobular hyperplasia found from my biopsy scares me a lot. I read in 20 % of the cases a woman will get B.C. in her other breast within 15 yrs. It's now been 11 for me. Just when I was starting to kind of feel safe & now this. I have such bad luck I'm afraid I will be in the 20% just as I was one out of 8 women who got it. I think there are a lot less extra pictures that have to be taken from digital mammos & those have been the kind I've gotten since my diagnosis. How long has it been for you, or maybe hopefully you've never gotten this god awful disease.",

      "Content": "I kept being told come back next year for 3 yrs. before being diagnosed. I think when changes first start, like what must be now happening in my right breast, they must take the wait and see attitude. I will still go to the onc. it certainly can't hurt. She will probably say let's wait and see too. It's too bad there are so many false positives with an MRI. Have you ever had one? I wonder if they ever just go ahead and do a biopsy when it is at the stage of mine where they just see a change. I guess we will never be able to relax, some people I know act like I just had a cold and then got over it. They haven't got a clue of what a nightmare it can be for the majority of us. Would the radiologist suggest an MRI or would that have to be ordered like the mammogram and ultra sound were? It's scary if I didn't complain about breast pain they wouldn't have done an ultra sound. I like to have both because I also get the results right away. I can't mentally take waiting around for two weeks to get the results from a mammogram. If they had just gone by the mammogram alone and the extra picture I would have passed without seeing any changes. Sounds like everyone needs all 3 test but I know that's not possible. Last year they only did an ultra sound on my left breast because I said I wasn't feeling any pain in the right at the time. I think that's strange they'd ever do an ultra sound and not check both breast. Now they've checked both and look what happened. Also the year before I was diagnosed in the left breast a needle biopsy was done and it said I did not have cancer. A year later more changes seen on mammogram and then they did a surgical biopsy. So all along I did have cancer. Scary!!!",

      "Content": "I'm so sorry you had to hear the words you have cancer. I know what that's like; it is one of the worst things someone can hear. It is very scary. It has now been 11 yrs. for me, I just went through my ordeal of them doing extra pictures, and I fear big time about the atypical lobular hyperplasia. I'm sorry about your health care. Even though I am in the U.S. believe me I have terrible insurance I have to pay a high price for. I have to pay increased rates and be punished because I made the mistake of getting cancer. I risk being dropped all the time because I don't have the safety of a group plan & so I have to be on an individual plan. I know it doesn't make sense, but it is unfair. We have to go through enough without worrying about not getting good health care too. Keep on moving on girl, you can get through this. It does get better with time, but the fear can never leave us until we hear they've found a cure. I can't believe they haven't found one yet.",
