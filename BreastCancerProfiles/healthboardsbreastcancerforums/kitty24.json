    "Content": "A year ago i pulled the pectoral muscle and did therapy and stretching for it,even accupuncture. Well the pain returned,and now it hurts in the neck,my left arm and under my breast.Sometimes it hurts in the whole breast.i did the breast exam and there is no lumps or anything new. I'm taking Yasmin for 4 months now,don't know if it's just hormones or something very serious. is it just a muscle or i need to go see a specialist?",
