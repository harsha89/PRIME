    "Content": "This is kind of an embarrassing question, but I'm a 20 year old male. About a week ago I noticed some pain in my pectoral muscle and when I went to go touch it I noticed this long lump in the left side of my chest. It starts about slightly to the left of my sternum right where the muscles starts and seems to continue horizontally across about half my left pectoral area. It's rather raised towards the middle of my chest but slowly becomes less pronounced as you move to the left until it finally disappears. I'm not really sure if \"lump\" is the best way to describe it considering it feels more like a a very think tendon, almost like a tube, or something along those lines but it isn't really movable. It doesn't hurt anymore, even when I put pressure on it but doesn't appear to have gone down in size. I recently had some blood work done which came back completely normal except for a liver enzyme was slightly abnormal. Is this something I should be really worried about or could it just be a strained muscle or something along those lines? Thank you. Edit: Figured I should add that it is in no way near the nipple. It starts about two or three inches below the collar bone and then extends horizontally across the pectoral from there.",
