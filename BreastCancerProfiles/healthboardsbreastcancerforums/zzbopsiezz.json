    "Content": "I have pain in my left armpit that sometimes radiates to my breast. I felt around the armpit and I can feel a rubber band with slight swelling in the center of the rubber band. I also have a rubber band in the right armpit, just not as prounced. Did you get your mammo done? Can you feel any swollen lymph nodes in your armpit? Did they do a mammo of the armpit?",
