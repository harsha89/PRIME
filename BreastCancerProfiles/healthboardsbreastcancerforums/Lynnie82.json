    "Content": "Hi there! My mom is a recent breast cancer survivor! Breast cancer doesn't run in our family and she is the 1st one to have it. She didn't have any lumps. She actually went in for her routine mamogram, and that's when they found out she had breast cancer...my mom said that she had no idea that she had it. So, it is possible to not have any signs/pain of breast cancer.",
