      "Content": "Hi everyone, I thought I may as well chime in on the Arimidex question. There is definitely pain. Pain that makes you walk like an OLD,OLD lady. There is also other side effects, such as blood clots, eye problems, painful and swollen hands, not to mention an itchey rash. There's not much information yet on side effects that you can find. I had my breast cancer in late 2001, and a heart attack in Nov. 2004. My oncologist says Arimidex had nothing to do w/ my heart attack.He was upset that I wanted to quit it. So I didn't at the time, however now my eyes are starting to be extremely irritated and dry. My eye pressure went to 33 in each eye and I had to see a specialist. You see, the lacrimal glands use estrogen, and Arimidex negates estrogen. I'm not really sure of the cause of my eye problems and that's why I'm on this board. I wanted to get some input from others about their experience with Arimidex. At the moment I've stopped taking it. I'd appreciate your comments .",

I entered this site not really expecting to find much about Arimidex. I was pleasantly surprized.I had breast cancer surgery in late 2001,hormone positive invasive ductal, and followed up with chemo and then radiation in 2002. Started Tamoxifen and for whatever reason, switched to Arimidex. I've had super intense pain in my hips and upper arms to the point of hardly being able to walk. But the real reason why I've stopped my Arimidex is because with out previous problems,I suffered a very serious heart attack in Nov. 2004. Oncologist insisted Arimidex wasn't the culprit. And he was not pleased that I quit it. Made an effort to scare me . I felt torn, and got no help except through the computer! Perhaps someone else has been through something similiar? I might add, though I'm off Arimidex for about 6 weeks; the joint pain remains, though not as bad as previously stated.Thanks for any input anyone has on this subject.",

I'm waiting to see if/when the pain subsides and I pray it does. The comment about it causing eye problems is interesting as I have dryness for which I've had to get prescription drops for. I wasn't aware of Arimidex being the possible cause---thanks for the info. Hi, Yes, that's another thing. My eyes have become so dry and intensely irritatedthat I had to visit my doctor. I'd rubbed so much , my pressure went sky high in both eyes, Scared me to death !Doc tried treating me with meds for glaucoma, but it turned out that wasn't the problem. I use an ointment and drops for dry eyes. My cataracts are very bad. Oncologist said no, Arimidex has nothing to do with it! Pain in hips when I get out of bed or up from a chair. I walk like a VERY old lady.Upper arms hurt when I'm lying down. I would say arthritis, If I'd ever complained of it before. I've not~~~Good luck in your journey to stay well. Not easy when taking all these wonder drugs. LOL",
