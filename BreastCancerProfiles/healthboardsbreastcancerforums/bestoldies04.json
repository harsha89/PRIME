      "Content": "I am very confused. I have had three Mammogram's in the last 8 months. The first one was positive, then had a second one and a Ultrasound both positive. They showed me on the screen what they were seeing you could definitely see something. I went back this week for my third Mammogram and second Ultrasound. The Ultrasound was positive but the Mammogram did not show anything. I am confused how two Mammogram's can show something then all of sudden nothing. But both Ultrasounds were positive. It was uncomfortable having the Ultrasound this week. Has anyone ever had multiple Mammograms and Ultrasounds on the breasts and they are all different?",

      "Content": "Thank you both for replying. I am confused because a total of three Mammograms showed something. The first one they didn't tell me they wanted to wait and see what the next one would show which was a year later. The next two Mammograms still showed something, also the two diagnostic Ultrasounds. They pointed out the areas of concern. You could see something without them showing me. They said it was puzzling because it is no longer on the Mammogram but they can still see it on the Ultrasound very clearly. I will remember that next time I have the Ultrasound not to have caffeine. I did have one and a half cups of coffee that day. Thanks again.",

      "Content": "Thank you for sharing this information, I feel much better knowing some of you have been going through the same thing. When I go for my next diagnostic Mammogram I am going to push for further testing since my breasts are very dense. This going every six months is a pain, I either have something or I don't. I am sure most of you feel this way, it's added stress.",

      "Content": "I can understand your frustration. I have several cysts in both kidneys, and several nodules in my lungs. (no I never smoked) The radiologist has not told me what have is a cyst, she said they don't know at this point. She showed me on the screen what they were seeing. The area was lit up in different directions all most like lightening.",
