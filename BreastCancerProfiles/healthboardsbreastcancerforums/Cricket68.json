    "Content": "Hi, Just read your post. Hope you are still here. I am having the same trouble with pain in my right breast. My mammographies for the past two years have been normal. I also had a sonogram that came out fine. The inflammatory type of breast cancer has some symptoms such as redness of the breast and a feeling of heat when touched. I don't have any of this. I do wonder why I have the pain. I have also seen a breast surgeon and he explained this as having estrogen bursts. I don't know but have been feeling like this for about two months also. How are you feeling?",
