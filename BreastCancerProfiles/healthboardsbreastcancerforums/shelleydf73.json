      "Content": "So I'm totally freaking out and having major anxiety. It is Saturday morning and last night I found a bb size knot just north of my nipple, kinda deep in there (I'm small breasted and 38 y/o). It isn't tender, has a rounded area on one side and the other side isn't palpable. Feels like its attached to something. I am BRCA1+ and had a total hysterectomy 5 months ago and plan to go see a breast specialist for the bilateral mastectomy after the holidays. Being a Saturday I likely won't be able to have an ultrasound or anything done but am going to call my doctor's office and see. Anyone have a similar issue? Being so tiny I'm hoping its nothing but am about to lose it. My mother had BC twice, 5 years apart, 1st at 40 y/o.",

      "Content": "Thank you for writing! I don't want to worry my family so we are all quiet about it until we see what it is but inside I am bursting with anxiety. As I was changing shirts this morning I noticed that the armpit is swollen and tender over the lumpy areas / lymph nodes. Also I see some superficial blood vessels where the tiny breast lump is. Did you have these? I'm sorry to hear that the chemo caused heart trouble for you! Is it something that you can manage with medications?",
