      "Content": "My adventure started with the words \"You have complicated cysts in both breast\". I had no idea what complicated cysts were either so I asked my doctor to explain. \"When you have an imaging test done one any part of your body, not just the breasts. They look to see if there is the presents of simple or complicated cysts. Simple cysts can be regarded as part of normal aging. Complicated cysts are varients of these simple cysts. These complicated cysts need careful evaluation, because the are different than they should be.\" A pretty simple explanation, but it helped me to understand. I hope it helps you also.",

      "Content": "JoJo, thank you for your response. I am right now 480cc. I think I am done with the fills. The only thing I can figure when they say everyone is different is body type. I am 5'8\" and my bra band is a 38. That is with absolutely no fat on my ribs. After my surgery I noticed that I can feel my ribs! So I guess I will have to ask him what size he is thinking about putting in. I am going with the gummy bear implants. I like them, doc showed me that they do not leak by sticking a knife into one. Freaked me out. Was the implant surgery as grueling as the mast.? I am a little bit of a wimp when it comes to the pain. MUCH better than I used to be. I tell everyone that if I can endure the fills I can endure anything. I just want it done so I can sleep on my side eventually. I have been sleeping flat on my back for to long now. Martha",

      "Content": "I had a lumpectomy on both in June. Got my results back on July 1st, will never forget that date. My surgeon told me that yes it was cancer but that they did not get all of it and she wanted to go back and see if she could get clear margins the second time around. I opted for the bi-mast. I have no family medical history, I was adopted. On sept 10th I had the bi-mast. My surgeon did the bi-mast and then my plastic surgeon came in and placed the expanders. He put in some saline and I stayed in hospital for three days. I wanted to die. The pain was unbelievable. Even with a morphine pump I was in so much pain. I was sent home with Vicodin. Worthless in my opinion. I was also given an antibiotic, Cyclomin? That made me sick to my stomach. I could not eat or drink anything but water and gingerale. I vomited alot and opened the incision on the right side. It has healed, just a very thick scar. Doc says he will remove it when he puts in the implants. Just thought I would give you the history. I do not know for sure when I will have my surgery. I must wait until I have the time off work. I can not live on our disability checks. They are a joke. Thanks for you help, I feel so much better now just knowing that someone else has gone through this. Martha",

      "Content": "As some of you may already know I had a bilateral mastectomy in Sept. I have tissue expanders in both sides. I have been having my fills done faithfully even though they hurt like hell. Now for the questions. When I have the fills the doctor informs me how much fluid I have in each. He says this like I should know what he is talking about. I want to be the same size I was before this whole nightmare started. How many cc's do I need to be a c-cup again? I asked him this question and he said it depended on the woman. What is that supposed to mean? He really is a good doctor but I am having problems understanding him sometimes. Should I buy a good bra that is a 38C and wait until I fill it up? I was mad when I was diagnosed and threw away all of my bras. I figured if they were going to remove my breasts I did not need them anymore. Childish, I know but that is the way I felt.",
