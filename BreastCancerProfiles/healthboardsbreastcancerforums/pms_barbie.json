    "Content": "I am so sorry for both of you. I came here looking for some help because my mother in law was just diagnosed with breast cancer. She is having her left breast removed week after next. She said the dr said it was stage 1. She had a lump removed last week. However they havnt from my understanding checked her lymp nodes yet. So how can they have already staged it? I about cried when she told me the news. However she told me dont you dare its going to be ok. She has a positive attitude I guess I am afraid it will turn out worse than she thinks it is. Any help on helping me understand the lymp thing would be greatly appreciated.",
