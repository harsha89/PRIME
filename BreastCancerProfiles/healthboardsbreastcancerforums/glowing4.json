      "Content": "I just had a mammogram and it came back with architectural distortion in the right breast. My doctor says not to worry, but go for a repeat mammogram. The nurses in the office said the report did not sound concerning too, and one receptionist had this and it was the result of the mammogram having the distortion not the breast! I am so scared as reading on the internet does say that architectural distortion can be a sign of breast cancer. Has anyone had this show up on a mammogram? Can anyone offer some encouragement or experience with this? Really scared! Thank you",
