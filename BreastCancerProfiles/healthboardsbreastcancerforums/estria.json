    "Content": "Hi Jitterygal, Get the biopsy. It is probably nothing, especially if both the mammo and ultrasound came back clear but better to be safe. You should also know that ovarian and breast cancer are related. If these types of cancer are caused by hereditary factors (and most cases of these cancers are not) they are tied to a BRCA 1 or BRCA 2 gene mutation which predispose to both breast and ovarian cancer. One of these results in a greater risk of acquiring breast or ovarian cancer (I cannot remember which one). These gene mutations are rather rare but if you are of Ashkenazi (Eastern European) descent, you have a higher chance of having these mutations and you may consider getting yourself tested for them, especially if you have ovarian cancer in your family. My post is meant to inform and not to scare you. Getting the biopsy will give you a much higher assurance that all is well and your doctor is being extra cautious. This is not a bad thing and once you have confirmed that the lump is OK with the biopsy, you will know for sure that all is well. Let us know how everything goes and take care of yourself. Estria",
