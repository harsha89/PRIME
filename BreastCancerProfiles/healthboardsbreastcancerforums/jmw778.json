    "Content": "I am getting pretty frustrated with my breast lump. I have a large peanut sized lump near the surface of my breast and close to the nipple. I also have a couple of dark green veins going through my areola to the area where the bump is. I found the lump three months ago and saw a doc a month ago. He sent me to have a mammogram and an ultrasound. I am thirty but have a family history of breast cancer (my mom got bc at 43). Both the mammogram and ultrasound came back negative. They couldn't see anything at all! It's a large hard lump so that kind of suprised me. The doctor said it is probably just a fibrocystic breast lump and told me to take vitamin E for three months. I'm just not sure about that result though. Wouldn't a large cyst show up on mammo/ultrasound? Why did nothing show up when it is such a big, hard lump? There is a lot of pressure in my breast but not really pain. What do I do now?",
