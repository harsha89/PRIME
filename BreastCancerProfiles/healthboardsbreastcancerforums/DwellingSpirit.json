    "Content": "I basically have the same thing going on myself and have questions. I have multiple lumps under both my left and right breast that are about pea sized. They don't hurt but are kind of tender if I touch them. I'm a male, btw, and 26 years old. I know sometimes medications can cause weird things to happen and when I was a kid I was on synthetic growth hormone. I also take an anti-depressant and have anxiety so I tend to freak out over this kind of thing. I don't want to be a hypochondriac but I am wondering about this.",
