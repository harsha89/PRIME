      "Content": "hi Kalie, I'm sorry to hear about your ordeal. 23 and 25 are pretty much the same in terms of age. Are you the first woman in your family to have this? Also, what is a biosy and what is a mastectomy? I really don't have any questions to ask. What should I be asking? I just want to know if this thing is bening and how/when I can get it removed. I'm guessing there are a lot of other things I should be asking.",

      "Content": "Thank you for your replies. Kalie, you sound like a strong woman. I'm glad the surgery went well. I had my appointment yesterday and they performed an ultra sound. They detected the lump and ruled out the possibilty of a cyst. The doctor believes it's fibrous and has suggested that I either do a needle biopsy or remove the lump via surgery. I'm a bit hesitant about the surgery and I asked her about the supplements I heard on the board. She said the supplements will not work for a fibrous lump and surgery (or leaving it in) is the only other option. Thanks again for your responses. I will be checking in to let you know how things are progressing.",

      "Content": "I'm 23 y/o and i have a lump the size of a globe grape in my left breast. I discovered it about 3 weeks ago. It's not painful, it's kind of moveable and it's pretty hard. I scheduled an appointment with the breast center and I'll be going in on Tuesday afternoon. A part of me is worried and a larger part of me is not. There hasn't been any woman in my family that has died of cancer, yet alone breast cancer. Am I in denial or something? Has anyone gone through this?",
