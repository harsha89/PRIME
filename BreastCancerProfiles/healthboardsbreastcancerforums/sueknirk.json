    "Content": "I had my Stage 1 tumor removed in June. It was about 1.5 to 2cm. Sentinel lymph nodes removed were benign. I had the Savi implant for radiation treatment. Started on generic Femara but could not tolerate it. I am now taking Tamoxifen and doing much better. Will have mammograms and ultrasounds every six months. I feel fine but I am scared of recurrence.",
