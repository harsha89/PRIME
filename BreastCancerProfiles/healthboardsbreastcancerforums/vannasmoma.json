    "Content": "So who ended up paying? I am having the same problem. My technician was angry at the receptionist for putting me in a natural breast slot when I had implants. She rapidly compressed the breast and ruptured the implant. Now Kaiser says they will just pay for removal of both implants and speak with the technician. I feel they are responsible for their 'disgruntled\" employee's bad day. Two review boards have denied it stating it is not medically nessasary to replace the implants since it is cosmetic. It 'was' cosmetic when I choose to have the original surgery, now it is repair of an injury caused by a Kaiser employee.",
