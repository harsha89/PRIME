      "Content": "Hello: Just recently my gynecologist informed me that a large mass - about the size of a large grapefruit - was found over the right side of my uterus. Several years ago, my previous gyn (I stopped seeing him because I moved) told me I had a small complex cyst & that it wasn't anything to worry about, judging from the tests he ran at that time. That was about 1 1/2 years ago. I'm wondering if it's possible that this mass is the same cyst that my former gyn found? I have a history of ovarian cysts & had a laparatomy in 1999. I am concerned about what this mass could be, given the fact that it's so large & that it is surrounded by some fluid. One of my friends informed me that she had a similar mass, but it turned out to be benign. I'm worried about what this could be - I would appreciate any advice anyone could give. One of my former co-workers passed away due to ovarian cancer - she was in her early fifties. I am 42 & from the symptoms I've been having - hot flashes, constant bleeding, etc, I was under the impression that I was going through menopause. Any thoughts? Thank you. Diana",

      "Content": "I recently found that both underarms (but mostly my right one) has been sore to the touch towards the middle. I remember reading somewhere online that underarm soreness could be due to breast cancer, so I am concerned. And for good reasons. There's a history of breast cancer on Mom's side of the family. Her sister had it, but it was caught early (Praise God!) and all they had to do - according to her oncologist - was a lumpectomy. However, my aunt requested and received chemo and radiation treatments to be on the safe side, even though her oncologist said they weren't necessary. One of her aunts - who would be my great-aunt, also had breast cancer many years ago and had a mastectomy. I'm in my late 40's and have had mammograms for years. Nothing's ever showed up. I'm due for one next week and will tell the technician about this issue. It doesn't feel sore all the time. It seems to be off and on. If I move my right arm a certain way I can feel it. Sometimes the middle part of my right underarm is sore to the touch, as is the left one. But I can't feel any lumps. With regard to my right underarm, it also feels sore near what I think is a tendon. Is this something I need to be worried about? I have a history of a variety of problems, including a borderline ovarian cancer, but the prognosis for that is excellent, and it will be 7 years this November since I was diagnosed with that. I had to have a hysterectomy because of the size of the mass. Thoughts, anyone? Thanks!",
