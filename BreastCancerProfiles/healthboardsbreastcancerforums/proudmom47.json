    "Content": "That happened to me two years ago. I went in for a mammogram, they saw something that looked suspicious, so I went back for another mammogram (magnified) and ultrasound. AS the tech was doing the ultrasound, she said Oh, I know what that is, it's nothing to worry about. I think she said it was a milk duct or something. Well, today I went in for my annual mammogram and am waiting on the results. I hate the waiting. I guess its because I did have a biopsy ten years ago that was benign and then the suspicious mammogram two years ago. Last year I just said, forget it. and then had one today. I also just came back from my Gyn who examined me really well and didn't feel anything. But I have always had lumpy breasts and my mother did also. But thank God I don't have any breast cancer in my family. BTW, are you the PLM that posted several times last year on the asthma board? I have been wondering how the lung thing was going for you?
