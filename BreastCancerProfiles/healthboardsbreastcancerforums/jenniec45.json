    "Content": "Hi: I recently had a similar experience, but I have always had fibrocystic breasts. I was showering and accidentally hit the nipple area with a very strong spray from the shower massage. That same evening, while undressing, I noticed a brownish stain inside my bra. I squeezed the nipple, but nothing came out. After a complete workup, mammogram, ductogram etc. and ultrasound, nothing could be found. It has been two weeks and I have not had any further bleeding. The surgeon attributes the spontaneous discharge to trauma from the shower massage, which is a relief, but seems strange. I hope that all has turned out well for you too. ------------------ Jennie",
