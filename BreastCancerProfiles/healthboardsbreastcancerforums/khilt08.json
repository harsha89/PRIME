I went back in two weeks to have it checked again and she said same thing. I am 39 and have been going for mamos since 35 because of my mother having breast cancer 18 years ago. I was scheduled for my mamo at end of April and made my doctor move it up to March. Found out I had breast cancer in my left breast. Had a bilateral mast on April 12. The cancer had spread to 4 of the left nodes under my left arm pit. Yours hopefully in absolutely nothing. THey say 80% of lumps are benign. I would just push for a mamo, mri and biopsy if needed. Take care, Best of luck. JoJo",
