I talked to my obgyn about this in August and she said it was probably nothing, possible irritation from a sports bra (I left the office feeling unsatisfied). Since then it's been on and off again erect, sometimes a bit scaly or rough feeling and lately I've been having pain on and off in the nipple. I have an appointment again tomorrow because I am so concerned, mainly after reading a post on another web board where a woman had a similar problem and was diagnosed with cancer, only after her doctor blew off her symptoms for a year..so, I'm really concerned now. I'm 31 with no family history (not that this really matters). Has anyone ever heard of anything like this or experienced it themselves? I'd appreciate any response. Thanks, L I've never heard of anything like that but I would strongly suggest you go see your doctor about it.",
