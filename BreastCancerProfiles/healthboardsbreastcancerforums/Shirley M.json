    "Content": "I had a biopsy and it was so much pain I thought I would die. They said they numb it but they didn't. Childbirth was worse pain but not much,it just lasted a lot longer. I got my results back and it is cancer. I'm waiting to go for more test and surgery.They don't know what kind of cancer it is yet. All of this and my Husband just died on 9/11. What else will happen? Any advise from you ladies would be appreciated ! Hugs Shirley",
