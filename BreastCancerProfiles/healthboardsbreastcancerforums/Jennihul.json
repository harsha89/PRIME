      "Content": "HIgh density masses just mean that they are, dense compared to the other breast tissue around them. They can still be benign, malignant or a cyst. You need an ultrasound to determine if it is solid or cystic (fluid filled.) If it solid, you will probably need a biopsy to be sure it is the good kind and not the bad kind of solid mass. More masses are benign than malignant. Jennifer",

If you MD thinks it would be prudent to biopsy it just to be sure, then celebrate their cautious attitude. Most breast masses, even when suspicious, turn out to be benign. Jennifer",

      "Content": "You have to be really specific if it is ON your actual nipple or just on your areola, around your nipple. Some breast cancers can manifest as red patches although they are the rarest kind. Called Inflammatory Breast Cancer, they don't come with lumps or the usual symptoms, just a flushing that is unexplainable (ie: not from sunburn,etc) and doesn't clear up. This kind of cancer is very deadly and very QUICK to spread. You have had yours awhile, so I doubt this is what you have. Crusty, red NIPPLES can come from a type of breast cancer called Paget's. Not to be confused with Paget's Disease, which manifests in bones. Dr Paget was a busy man, apparently. It is usually one-sided and only the nipple is involved in the reddish appearance. This is also somewhat rare. Red rashes and itchy spots on the areola are more common and usually benign. We see it in alot of people with food allergies, sensitivities to laundry products and general acne problems. Sometimes caused by eczema. You should show a doctor so you can be evaluated. It's probably nothing to worry about, but if it is something you need to understand waiting is not in your favor. Almost all breast cancers are survivable if handled early. Jennifer",
