      "Content": "Hello, I know I def. should see my ob/gyn about this, she usually just sends me straight for an ultrasound for any breast complaints. But until then I would like to ask if this could be a sign of cancer? I looked down at one of my breasts and noticed a a little bit of clear fluid coming out, when I lifted it to take a closer look, more came out, it is clear and a bit sticky, I am worried, I have never been pregnant or had sex, I am 32, I had one ultrasound for this little lumpy thing once. I don't have insurance, so I have to go throught this hospital aid process, until then I am not sure how bad or not so bad this is? Thanks in advance for any info that can be provided.",

      "Content": "I went through the ultrasound yesterday, for some reason it was really painful. Called the doctor today and said that if it was anything serious the radiologist would have paged her. Thank God. I was really worried after I saw blood, but it turns out if might just be a cyst and hormonally...my periods need to be regulated. My internet search really just put up some red flags for a bloody nipple discharge...everything seems to be okay, Thank God. I wish everyone God's blessings, good health and a speedy recovery.",

      "Content": "Hello Laura, Thanks for your reply. I have been doing the web search thing, also and I wasn't so worried, until it changed color...It is now yellow and just today, I have a blood discharge, I don't know if it was because I was manipulating my breast, thinking it was just a cyst...but the doctor has ordered a blood test and ultrasound, but this was just when it was a clear fluid, I have to call back on Monday and tell her about the blood. After another web search about a blood discharge, it doesn't look too good...God willing, we will both be okay. To paraphrase a poet, May God's peace and blessings drop like blossoms and surround you.",
