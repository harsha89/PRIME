    "Content": "I am writing to see if anyone else has experienced. Several days ago I suddently developed a red bite like bump on the side of my left breast. It is red but the bump feels like it is under the skin. It does not itch or hurt. It is not going away after 5 days. I am aware that Inflammatory breast cancer sometimes does start as a bug bite looking sore. I am going to go to the doctor tomorrow but was wondering if there are any other types of conditions that may cause something like this? Any help would be greatly appreciated.",
