      "Content": "There are some natural alternatives to tamoxifen. Tamoxifen can cause cancer of the uterus, liver, etc. I had a terrible vaginal dryness and irritation, (maybe you won't), some depression, loss of libido and i'm now checking out why my platelet count was low - it can be due to tamoxifen. So, i've gone to a nutritional doctor, and am taking supplements that help excrete and block estrogen (cause of breast cancer) naturally. You can go to websites on tamoxifen and also estrogen and there is something called 'estrogen dominance syndrome', which some of you may have as well. Just helping. Even though the tamoxifen has benefits, it has many drawbacks, as well, and most if not all oncologists will not recommend anything else natural because it's all not approved by teh fda yet, but there are many studies. There is also a natural dr on line named \"dr.Murray'. Check him out. I didnt' want to suffer on that tamoxifen and I really hope none of you do. Good luck.",

      "Content": "reba, i've never heard of that, but you should check on a website or ask your local health food store guy. good luck. i'm going back to the gyno for an internal sonogram in july to see how my fibroid is doing. if it grew, we'll see what will happen, but if it didn't then i know it's from the tamoxifen. my breast surgeon even said it was a good ideae to go off it for a while, then when i go back,,i'll really be aware of the effects it's having on me. i'm not happy about going back on it, but i'm also not totally comfortable being off it, especially when i talk to my oncologist, who's insistant that i stay on it and never go off it! is anyone out there experiencing bad side effects? Please let me know. Have you all seen suzanne somers talk about tamoxifen, etc? Finally, someone stood up to say it sucks!",
