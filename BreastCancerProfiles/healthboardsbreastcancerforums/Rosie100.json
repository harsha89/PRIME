      "Content": "do cancerous lumps in the breast remain the the same size, shape no matter whether you are lying down or standing up etc? if, for example, you can feel something when you are standing but if you check your breasts lying on your back you cant feel anything, is there still a chance it is cancerous or can you always feel them once they are there? i know that the contraceptive pill and your regular period can create changes in the breast, but i am not sure. thank you.",
