Getting off caffeine (which I ingested a great deal of daily at the time) did away with them. I never once considered going further with biopsies, etc. But then there is no incidence of any female cancers in my family so I'm not greatly at risk. That was also part of my decision process.",

Very common in younger women, esp adolescents. My breast was sore in one spot. They did a mammo, a \"super\" mammo (more compression) and an ultrasound all in the same visit. Because of the testing and the manual exam which showed that it was moveable and very small, it was left to me to decide if I wanted it removed. Since they would have had to remove a large amount of breast tissue at the top left of the right breast to get to it(toward the armpit) that would disfigure my breast (no reconstructive ssurgery back then for this sort of thing), I elected to listen to my gyno and surgeon and do nothing. They feel caffeine constributes to the pain so I stopped it. (worse than when I quit smoking). It eventually went away. Most do. End of story.",

Or, since it's your first mammo, they just may want to get a higher resolution one for your baseline. If it was something they thought was very serious, you would have gotten a phone call, not a letter. You are way jumping overboard on this. I'd just take it in stride. If you have dense breasts, they might also want another. So many reasons that are just nothing. Good luck and I'm sure it will turn out fine.",

Happens to me periodically as I have a fibroid cyst. Not all facilities have 3D mammo units yet but I would check and see if any in your town do and use those in the future.",
