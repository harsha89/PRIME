      "Content": "Yesterday out of the blue a bright pink/red blotch appeared on my left breast, as though I was burned by an iron measuring about an inch. No bumps or anything else. Its still there this am. Im panicked I have IBC. Im calling my dr today. I had a breast MRI 6 months ago, would this detect this? Does not seem like a rash from anything which is the concerning part meaning I don't know what else could cause a mark like this.\u200b",
