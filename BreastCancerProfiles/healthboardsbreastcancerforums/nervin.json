    "Content": "Hi, Just so you are aware there is a deadly type of BC called IBC inflammatory breast cancer. This cancer usually is very deadly and it comes on very suddenly. My Mother has this type of BC, and so far she survived 8 years; howver it is suspected that it is back due to her blood tests. Usually it is classified at stage 3B. Most of the time there is no lump, just swelling and a red rash. Sometimes there is a very large lump that appears overnight. This type of BC has 2 types, one is estrogen positive and one is genetic based. For more info. you can look up Inflammatory BC on the internet and read about it.",
