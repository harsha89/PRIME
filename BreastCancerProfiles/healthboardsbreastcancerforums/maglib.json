      "Content": "As a nomal worry wart would be I need to ask what everyone thinks as I hate going to doctors and really can't find one I like in Monmouth County NJ. I started working out regularly about a 2 months ago and had back pain in my mid right back (left upper shoulder blade area)that started about 1 month ago and thought nothing of it since I was working out but, the pain is still there although it doesn't stop me from my normal activities. I then recently (about 2 weeks ago) felt feeling like a bruising under my right arm pit which I found a small lump which was pinky width size and now feels pointer finger width size which could just be swollen lymph nodes. It feels slightly tender (bruise like) to the touch and sometimes I can't even find the lump while it's tender for about a 2\" diameter. Please let me know if these things are related? Should I wait or is it important to see a doctor and if so, what kind of doctor? Thank you for your help and kindness.",
