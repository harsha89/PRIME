    "Content": "I had a mammogram about 2 weeks ago and because of the compression from the machine, we discovered I had a thick, green discharge from one breast. Then yesterday they did an ultrasound and the doctor said there was something there but all they could tell me was that it is not a cyst. He recommended I get a biopsy. So today my primary doctor called me and said they would set me up for a biopsy and that they would be looking for cancer, but that doesn't mean that's what it is. The research I've done on green discharge usually says it's likely not cancer, but my doctor's comment about the biopsy kind of got me worried. Any advice? Thanks!",
