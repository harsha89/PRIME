      "Content": "Sounds like it's a cyst of some kind. Breast cancer does not make the area tender. It also would not just show up one morning all sore. That is why sometimes it gets missed because there is no tenderness with it. I am not a doctor though so don't rely on the opinions of us here. Get it checked out anyways.",

      "Content": "I have had a dry patch of skin under my right nipple for the last few weeks. If I put lotion on it it feels soft but each day in the shower it feels rough again and I put lotion on it right when I get out of the shower. So I read online that dry patches of skin can be cancer. Has anyone experienced just this as a symptom and it turned out to be cancer? I have no lump at all there it's just a bit dry. It's only in one spot though on the right breast. I thought maybe it was just dry skin since it is winter here and pretty cold. But the patch is about a half inch wide under the right nipple and that's it. it's not that dry it's just a little rough. Any advise?",
