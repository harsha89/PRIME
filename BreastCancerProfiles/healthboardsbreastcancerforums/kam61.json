      "Content": "My radiation will be after four months as well but that is because I had to have two surgeries, the margins were not clean, first surgery June 19/08 second July 14/08 then I ended up with an infection which took 16 days of antibiotics. started chemo on Aug 26 I will not be done with chemo until the end of Oct and my radiation Ongolist said |need at least 4 weeks if not six weeks after chemo to ensure I have recovered enough to do the 6.5 weeks of daily radiation. It does seem like a long time but when you think what your body is being put through you have to give some time before you attack it again. If however I did not need chemo and was just getting radiation it would have been 10 to 12 weeks from the first surgery. Not sure if that helps you, but I do not think your mom should wait,",

It really is amazing stuff and I know he sells it all over canada, but I am sure my sister has picked some up in Minn. where she lives. kam",
