    "Content": "Hi! I am a 34 year old post surgical menopausal woman with a concern. Over the past month, I have had painful breast tenderness which has gradually gotten worse. The past couple of days, along with the tenderness, I feel like my breasts are full and swollen. Is this normal? I have been on Ortho Evra for HRT for the past 3 years. Thank you!",
