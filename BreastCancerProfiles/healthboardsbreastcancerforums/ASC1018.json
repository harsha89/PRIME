    "Content": "About 10 days ago I lifted my arm to shave and had a HUGE lump in my armpit. I have just seen my breast surgeon (had the same breast biopsied for nipple dishcarge in April). He called it a mass...an ancillary mass. I am having mammo today and he said it has to come out and be biopsied. It is very swollen... I have no clue yet and no idea what this could be. He was alarmingly concerned yesterday and in a big rush. Anyone had this before? What are the possibilities? I'm terrified only because of the biopsy less than a month ago.",
