      "Content": "Was your pain like quick, sharp intermittent stabs that could be anywhere on that particular breast? I have been getting quick little sharp intermittent jabs of pain in one breast for 4 days now. I had a core biopsy in February for microcalcifications that were benign. Then 43 days later I had a breast infection in that breast. Now that I am off antibiotics I have this intermittent pain. The doctor wants me to have another ultrasound and mammogram when I just had a mammogram in February. Has your pain subsided yet?",

      "Content": "From what I have read it is okay to take hormone replacement therapy for a couple of years and no longer. That you run a risk of breast cancer if you take it any longer than that. That it is not meant for long term. On the other hand my mother who had a hysterectomy and is 76 just got off Premarin after twenty years. She has no breast cancer, so I think it is just a crap shoot as to what will happen. I have not gone into menopause yet (49) and I am hoping I don't have bad hot flashes and have to go on HRT to stop them. It is a tough decision where you could be dammed if you do and dammed if you don't.",

I spoke to her this morning and she said that I have a blood clot in the vein. That it will take several weeks to dissolve. In the meantime to take Tylenol for the pain. I will do as you suggested and show the doctor when I go to find out my pathology results.",

      "Content": "I had an excisional biopsy on 4/10 under general anesthesia. When the Anesthesiaologist pushed the IV in the vein in my hand it was very painful. When I came to after the operation and was told to get dressed I noticed this huge buldge on my hand. It was larger than an unshelled almond under my skin where the IV was. I showed it to the nurses assistant and she pushed it down hard with her thumb. That was painful too. After several days the swelling in my hand went down and I am left with this vein that looks like a fat worm. The vein is very tender and painful from my fingers to my wrist. It has been 6 days and I am concerned. Has this happened to anyone else and did the pain go away? Did the vein get smaller? Any advice? It is bad enough that I have to worry about having BC, but I have this unexpected surgery side effect too.",

      "Content": "Thank you so much for your posts. I fear the unknown and having information helps lessen my anxiety. I saw my mamogram and it looked like the night sky with little stars all around. The technician said that they were calcifications. Since I have so many all over, I fear that is not a good sign. It is so hard to keep a positive attitude. At least I don't have long to wait for my biopsy. I figure that if I do have cancer, that I will go for the masectomy without reconstruction. If I had a lumpectomy I would be stressed that there was still other calcifications in there ready to become cancerous. Since I am thin, I would need an implant for reconstruction and that would make the needed mamograms difficult causing me to be stressed too. So if I do have cancer, I would be better off psychologically just having the masectomy with no reconstruction. I know that I am jumping the gun, but I have always been the type to think the worst, and hope for the best. Thanks again for taking the time to help.",

The technician did not show me the area, she was just showing me the full breast on the screen and I asked her what the little stars all over were. I am just worried that if I do have cancer that a lumpectomy would not be the way to go when I have all of these calcifications all over. It is like my breast would be a ticking time bomb. I wonder if a person can have a lot of calcifications and it never becomes cancer?",

      "Content": "I had microcalcifications too. I was told to come back in 6 months for a follow up mammogram. The new mammogram showed changes so they wanted a stereotactic biopsy. That biopsy showed no cancer, but in the tissue samples came part of a papiloma (which can be associated with cancer). So now they wanted an excisional biopsy in case they just happened to miss some cancer near the papiloma. The excisional biopsy came up negative for cancer too. This all happened from Feb to April of this year. I am extremely happy that they did not find anything, but it was a very stressful time. My breast is still recovering from all of the biopsies. It is tender, part feels hard and I get intermittent pangs of pain. This just reminds me how my breasts can be ticking time bombs. I know if it was me and I thought my breast had changed I would be worried. Why not call the doctor's nurse and get her advice? If they want to do the mammogram early, at least this will give you peace of mind. If they want a biopsy, remember that 80% of biopsies are benign.",

Well it turned out that I had calcifications that they wanted to monitor. A cluster of calcifications have grown so they now want to do a core biopsy. I am scheduled for this coming Thursday. Has anyone had this and how was the procedure and after effects? I am told that only 20% of these calcifications are positive for cancer, so I am trying my best not to panic. Any words of wisdom or advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.",

      "Content": "Dear Boodle and NewfieII: Thank you both for your replies. To Boodle: What does that mean when you said \"I had 7 in one group\"? Does that mean that you had 7 biopsies done? Thank you for going into detail about the core biopsy. To: NewfieII: I am 49. Do you know how many days it takes until you usually get your results from pathology? I would most likely go for the no reconstruction because I just don't want to worry that they got all of the cancer out. I read something about margins. If the cancer is not close to the bones and I have a masectomy where it did not reach the lymph nodes then I would feel that I had a better chance of no recurrence. Do you still have to go for a mamogram or an ultrasound if the breast was removed? I know that they would still do a mamogram on the remaining one. Thank you both again, I really appreciate your posts.",
