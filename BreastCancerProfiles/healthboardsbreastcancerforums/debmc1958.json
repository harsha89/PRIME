Any advice would be much appreciated as I'm only 18 and very panicked now. Thanks x I have a similar lump but am much older than you. I think it is a lymph node. It could be swollen from an infection but it can also be more serious. I hope you have a doctor look at it. I am going on Monday to a breast doctor but like I said I am 54 so breast cancer is a concern. If you look up axillary lymph nodes you will find some information but really I've been looking for days and have learned nothing but a bunch of worthless terminology. Bottom line is that if the doctor thinks it's suspicious, he will do a biopsy.",
