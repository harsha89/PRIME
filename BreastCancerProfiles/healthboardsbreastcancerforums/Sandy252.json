    "Content": "Recently I woke up with a very painful right breast. It was a little swollen and I figured maybe I slept on it the wrong way or something like that. The following day it was red at the base of my nipple and very painful. I called my gyn and was seen the next day. A mammogram and ultrasound was ordered. I had a mammogram in May and it was fine. Today, after she did the mammogram she left the room and came back and said she had talked to my Doc and he said if the radiologist read it and didn't feel the need for the ultrasound then I wouldn't need to have it done. A short while later I was told I could leave and that the ultrasound was not necessary. No one, of course, would give me any information. So I left just as anxious as when I got there. I have a doctor appointment tomorrow and I'm being cautiously optomistic. I have been on antibiotics for almost a week and the redness, swelling, and pain have subsided. I am 62 and cannot figure why I would even get mastitis. I have been fearing IBC but all seems to have been resolved by the antibiotics. I would just love it if someone could give me a positive bit of feedback. Thanks",
