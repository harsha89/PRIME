    "Content": "I don't have cancer, but my mother and aunt do. My mother has infiltrating Duktile carsinoma. My aunt has Duktile carsinoma Ins (sp, not sure of), and Lobul carsinoma. Spelling is not my strong suit, and I am sorry. I just found out today of my mother, though my aunt had her breast removed 2 years ago. My mother is going to get it (not breast) removed and going to start radi soon after. My life is in a fog, I am lost and can not grasp how someone feels or how I need to be there for them. My older sister is going for a mamogram in the morning and I am to follow late next week, along with my mothers surgery. My breasts have hurt for months, and am now more scared knowing so many in my family are fighting the battle, and now me at 35 possibly will fight the same and can't be there for my Mother, but to be with her in her battle. I want to talk to her, but know that she is being strong for us, my aunt opened my eyes in saying that my mothers was Infiltrating. I am scared, and wish to know how to be the one to be there for the sick. I now face the fear that I can not be the strong one I need to be for them. Please let me know what puts you at ease knowing that others are there, yet not stepping on your toes. Also let me know how you are dealing with your cancer, knowing that I may myself have to pull myself through this unforgiving monster. Thank you.",
