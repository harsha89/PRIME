    "Content": "I am a 48-year-old woman with dense breasts. I have never had children and I do have three maternal aunts who had breast cancer - also one cousin, the daughter of one of these aunts. However, my mother and her other sister never had breast cancer, and none of my 3 sisters (all older than me) have either. I have not yet reached menopause. I recently had two vacuum-assisted stereotactic biopsies because of microcalcifications found first on digital screening mammograms and later viewed with a closer look on digital diagnostic mammograms (September 2005). There were three sites of clustered microcalcifications found - two on my left breast and one on my right. I was referred to a specialist breast surgeon - I met with her, she looked at my mammograms and examined my breasts. She referred me back to the radiologist to perform two sterotactic biopsies - one on my left breast and one on my right. (The third site was too close to the chest wall to have a stereotactic biopsy performed.) Fortunately, the pathology report determined the samples to be benign. I then heard from the same breast surgeon, who had discussed my case with the same radiologist after the stereotactic biopsies had been performed - and the surgeon advised that it would be best to have a surgical biopsy for the last site of clustered microcalcifications that was near the chest wall on my left breast. However, I've read that is a good idea to have a second opinion before one goes in for a surgical biopsy. I would feel more comfortable getting a second opinion regarding the surgical biopsy. Who should I get the second opinion from - a radiologist or a surgeon? If surgery is recommended by the second physician, I do feel comfortable with the first surgeon and I would go back to her for the surgery. However, if a wait and see approach is recommended, I may want to go that route. My surgeon suggested that I should have this done within the month. The microcalcifications were very small - hardly noticeable to the human eye on the mammogram. They were noted on x-ray reports by a different radiologist from mammograms from 1999 and 2000 - but just listed as calcifications - perhaps they could not see microcalcifications because they never took other close-up views. I waited five years before having another mammogram and I did bring the old films to the new radiologist. I never was told that any type of calcification was something to be alarmed about. (Therefore, I never was that concerned with the previous reports - nor, did my doctors seem to be.) I would be most appreciative if you could respond soon because this is a time-sensitive matter. I would really be grateful if someone in the medical community could respond to this post. Thank you so much!",
