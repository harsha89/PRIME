      "Content": "I am 49 year old, 1 child, breast fed, do mammogram each year. Last month my radiologist A called me back for 2nd one and there are a few more calcification dots on my right side breast and two calcifications size increased. He suggested and scheduled me for a needle biopsy at a center facility. But doctor B who was suppose to do stereotactic biopsy told me the two suspicious calcifications are deeper & close to the chest wall but she would try her best to do. After I was put on the bed she told me the calcifications are in scatter patter and not cluster , they are benign. She did one more mammogram (enlarged) and overwrite doctor A\u0092s rule and had me do a mammogram in 4-6 months I went to a surgical general doctor C (breast specialty) referred by my family doctor and she suggested a surgical biopsy and same reason with radiologist A for knowing why there are some changes and what activities is there. My x-ray film shows an enlarged breast size (watermelon) and two suspicious dots size like a small grain of rice. I\u0092m thinking about if I can temporarily hold on the surgery and do something else that might help from different point of view: 1. Do a MRI exam but don\u0092t know if breast MRI is clearer than mammo. 2. Just wait for another 3 months and do another a mammo. Q: Do I have to do biopsy each time when doctors find anything suspicious or changed? Any advices will help. Thanks! Shirley",

      "Content": "rudiraven, Thank you very much for your thoughts and I seem to have the same feeling as your do. It always make me feel better to listen somebody else's suggests. Certainly it is very difficult for me to make a decision like this. I'll see one more doctor whose specialty is oncology-breast cancer and hope it will help my decision making. Thanks again.",

      "Content": "Hi, Ellemae, Thanks for your reply. When first I got into this, my husband thought we probably need to trust the radiologist A more because of her experience. We are hasitating about this now because of the doctor B. My mother told me that sometimes you got to believe yourself and have some confidences to deal with. But it wouldn't be that easy when a real situation like this comes to you. Thanks again!",

      "Content": "Cody, Thank you for your concern. This situation suddently came to me and the result was not expected before my mammograms. If the doctor I'll see him next month thinks it is necessary to do the test. Then I might have to convince myself to do it. Otherwise this issue is hanging there for at least 3-6 months or even longer which also makes me feel stressful. Thanks again!",
