      "Content": "Thank you both for your replies. I saw the surgeon this morning and have been scheduled for the biopsy on the 24th. From how they explained it, it sounds like the wire guided biopsy as well. I have several calcifications and they are all spread out and not clumped together which makes them more suspicious but he was encouraging the majority of the time they are benign. Off kilter - I hope everything turns out for your son - just keep getting those tests done so if something does change, you'll catch it early. I'm real glad I decided to get the mammogram done (it has been 3 years!). Gardening grand - I hope everthing goes well with your biopsy I will be thinking of you as well. Be sure to keep us posted. Thanks again for your support.",

      "Content": "Hello Everyone - I went to a follow-up mammogram (don't let the user name fool you - I am female) this morning after they noticed tissue changes in my left breast. The radiologist said I have calcifications and that I need to have a biopsy. I have an appointment with the surgeon tomorrow morning. He told me worst case is it is cancer but in the earliest stages and very treatable. Best case is everything is benign. I'm scared and would like to know if anyone else out there has had this and what the results were. Thanks in advance.",
