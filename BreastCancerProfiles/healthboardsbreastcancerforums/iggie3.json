      "Content": "I am going in for conization on friday, the 11th. I am trying hard to not be scared to death in front of my kids. I have been diagnosed with severe dysplasia, and have been thinking all along that it is only PRE cancerous. Now I have learned that there is more lab work to be done after this procedure checking for cancer. I am so afraid of cancer I can hardly speak. I would love to hear some success stories from anyone that has been diagnosed Severe, but came out OK. Wish me luck ya'll.",
