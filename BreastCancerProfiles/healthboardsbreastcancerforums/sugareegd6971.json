    "Content": "Hello. I am 25 years old and for almost a year now, I have had one lump under each armpit..feels like im squeezing a muscle. I went to the doctor and they gave me some strong medicine, but they are still there. I was just reading about IBC. I am stressing out. I have no health insurance or I would be in and out of doctors offices. Does anyone else have these lumps under their armpits. Thanks for reading. HAPPY HOLIDAYS!!! Dawn",
