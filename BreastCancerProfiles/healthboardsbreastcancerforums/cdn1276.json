    "Content": "I am quite worried about my mom right now. She is 49, a smoker, and in Oct, she found a rash on her right breast. The doctor prescribed antibiotics and it went away. A month ago, she developed 2 abscesses around her nipple area on the same breast, that she's had drained. A culture showed that it was a bacterial infection and they gave her a strong antibiotic. They also scheduled a mammogram and ultrasound as a precaution, and said when those test results come back, they want to schedule her with a specialist. She went on Wed for her mammogram, and they immediately did an ultrasound as well. I'm very worried that there is something more to this. What would she need to see a specialist for, if it's just a bacterial infection. Also, is it normal to do an ultrasound right after a mammogram. It there a strong chance that this could be breast cancer. Any advice would be greatly appreciated cause I'm making myself sick with worry.",
