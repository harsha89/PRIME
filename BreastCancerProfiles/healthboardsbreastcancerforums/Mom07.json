      "Content": "Hello, I was wondering how did your biopsy turn out? I am a 26 years old female I have a 7 yr old son and a 3 year old daughter. Ever since i stopped my birth control pills October of 2011 I noticed a small lump in my left breast. I waited to se if it went away and it didn't by January of 2012 I went to the Dr told her about it and she said it was probably just a cyst and by then I was 7 weeks pregnant with my daughter. In Febuary i told my obgyn and he felt it and wasnt concerend either. After that every year I would go to my annual physical each time with a different NP and they didn't seem concerned. The weird thing is that they couldn't feel it while doing the regular breast exam. I would always have to point it out to them since you could only feel it if I turn to the right while laying down. But it was just so bothersome sometimes and just that thought of what if it is something bad and I'm not doing anything about it. In April of this year I finally went to another NP since I don't have insurance. She sent me for an ultrasound, couple days later they call me. I went in and they said it was a nodule about 3 cm long but its not round its more of like a skinny toothpick to describe it best. I have no discharge only sore sometimes. I was referred to a surgeon who felt the lump said I have fybrocycstic breast, took a look at the ultrasound and said it was nothing bad. He told me you dony get breast cancer at Ur age. I felt like he didnt take it seriously. I told him if he could please do the biopsy just to be on the safe side he didn't want to he said that it would only do more harm than good and if I wanted a biopsy I would have to go for another Dr. And to be careful with Dr's that just want to make a quick buck on young girls like me. I didn't know what to think since this Surgeon was in his 70's I would say . I would think he is more experienced in what he does. But ever since they told me I needed a biopsy I started feeling shortness of breath. I was always needing to take deep breaths. And if that isn't enough in the beginning of June I started getting this pop sound when I take a deep breath coming from like behind my heart like by my spinal cord in between my lungs . I'm just worried my lung left lung hurts sometimes. And its the same side where I have my breast lump. I had an xray done mid June and it came clear. Still now I have been able to control my anxiety without meds but I still have that constant need to take deep breaths or else I feel so out of air. I hate it. Sometimes I do think it in my head because if I'm really busy I don't fell like I'm taking deep breaths. Or maybe I'm to busy i don't notice me doing that. But there still that pop sound. I dont think you can hear unless you use a stethoscope. I think its more of the popping feeling. It only pops once each time I take a deep breath. And sometimes it won't do it. I notice it pops more when I'm under more stress. But it doesn't hurt when it pops. When I told the NP (nurse practitioner) for some odd reason it would not pop. I don't know what else to do. I would like to go for a second opinion but since I have no insurance and ever thing is so expensive. I'm just scared. That if its cancer its now spread into my lungs I wouldn't want to leave my kids without a momï¿½ï¿½ But I'm just wondering after four years if it was cancer wouldn't I have more symptoms by now? Or possibly be dead? I forgot to add that i dont feel like it has grown in size. Buy yet i feel it almost everyday. Thanks for reading I hope I make sense! - mom07",

      "Content": "Hello, I too have an everyday fear of having breast cancer. I am 26 year old female. And since I was 22 yra old I noticed a small lump on my left breast at 3 o'clock. I would go to my annual physical and was always told it was nothing. But in the back of my head have always had that worry. In April I finally told my Dr. Which is a nurse practitiner since I don't have insurance. I had an ultrasound done. Which came back that I had a nodule about 3cm long but its like a thin long toothpick to describe it. I was told I needed to get it biopsy. Went to a surgeon and he took a look at the ultrasound and again was told it was nothing bad. And the Dr said Ur to young to get Breast Cancer. He said I had fybrocistic breasts.It felt like he blew me off just because of my age. I mean I've heard of people younger than me with breast cancer. And no cancer runs in my family. Thank god! I don't have any discharge . Only pain that comes and goes. Sometimes they feel sore and at times I also get sharp pains. But ever since I was told I needed the biopsy I started getting short of breath like I can't get air in and I always feel like that. My lungs hurt especially my left one. So that worries me more since its on the same side of my breast lump. And I start to worry what if it is cancer and its now spread to my lungs. I went again to nurse practicioner. And she said it was anxiety prescribed me paxil 20 mg. Which I have not taken because I said if it is anxiety I know I can control it. Which I have but still months later I am constantly always taking deep breaths because if I don't I feel out of breath. And if that isnt enough in June something else came up. Some time when I take a deep breath I have this pop sound which feels like comes behind my heart by my spinal cord. Or like in between my lungs. Its hard to explain. Its happens at least 30 times a day. It's annoying and worrysome. I feel like I'm not taken seriously. What scares me the most is leaving my 7 yr old son and 3 yr old daughter without a mother.ðŸ˜¢",
