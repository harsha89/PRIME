    "Content": "Hello, I am a 38 year old female and a 16 year survivor of thyroid cancer, I was diagnosed and treated for it in 1997. I have never had a recurrence of my cancer, and I have been on a synthroid regimen since 1997. Regarding all of the advertisements I see about getting tested for breast cancer, I have a few questions. Now, I have never had breast cancer. Breast cancer is not in my family's history (that I know of...I am adopted; however, to my knowledge, breast cancer was not in my birth family's medical history, nor is it in my adoptive family's history). I have never had any risk factors for breast cancer. I had regular gynecological checkups with my doctor until about three years ago when my insurance ran out. I have not had a checkup in 2-3 years due to not having insurance and my employers did not offer insurance. I have done self exams on my breasts and never felt any lumps. All of my life, I have been told that it was something that I really didn't need to worry about until I reached my 40s and did not need mammograms until I was 40. I will turn 39 years old April of 2014. Now, this just may be my fears playing into all of the breast cancer awareness month advertisements that I see on tv, but I was wondering that given my past cancer history and health problems and being hypothyroid; SHOULD I go ahead and start having mammograms now and getting tested now or just wait until after I turn 40??? Like I said, it just may be my fears playing into everything, however, I just want to be sure. I appreciate any advice that you all can give me. Thanks!",
