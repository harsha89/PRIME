    "Content": "I've posted on HealthBoards before, but on the thyroid forum, hence the name \"ThyroidGirl.\" Now here I am hanging out on this message board too, thanks to breast calcifications. I had some a few years ago that were biopsied and all turned out fine, but a recent mammo showed I have more again, this time in a cluster. I've read a cluster is more likely to be DCIS. I'm having a stereotactic biopsy in the morning and I'm scared. I'm wondering if there is a connection between my thyroid problems (thyroid removed in '06 due to goiter; benign for cancer), my pituitary adenomas (which supposedly aren't doing anything) and my calcified and cystic breasts! I feel like my hormones are wreaking havoc on my body. Anyone have similar problems or have experience with calcification clusters?",
