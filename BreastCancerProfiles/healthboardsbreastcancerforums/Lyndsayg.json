    "Content": "I've had bother with my right breast for over a year now. I first had pain last October and my gp said it was a large cyst I attended the breast clinic in the December and when the consultant examined me and said there was no cyst I just have lumpy breasts. But the thing is my sore breast has always been bigger than the left and lumpier. So anyway I had an ultrasound the same day which was clear. I was fine for a while after that as I do have anxiety so after hearing I was OK i calmed down. I had a bit of pain a few months ago then it went but now when I press an area I get a sharp pain especially if my daughter presses against it leaning on me. I have had this before too. I'm waiting on a breast clinic appointment it's been 12 weeks and I've just had a call from them today to say they'll be on touch in a few weeks. I'm so worried it's cancer and I'm having to wait so long. I'm so scared ill die and leave my nearly 2 year old",
