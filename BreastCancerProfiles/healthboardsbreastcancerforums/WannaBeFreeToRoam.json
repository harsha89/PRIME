      "Content": "Hi Maria, Some gynocologist, mine included think that there are different pain meds for female problems than for other illnesses. They can give you muscle relaxers, which do help with the pain. But, some of them hardly help at all. And it depends on how long you are going to take them and if you are going to try and work while taking them and if you have children to watch after. That said, the only pain medications that I have ever taken, were for frozen shoulder, arthritis, sprained ankle and female problems. Hydrocodone works well. It comes in at least 2 strengths. I have only ever taken 5 mg. It also comes in 7.5 mg. I now take Tramadol (Ultram) and it works some. But not as good as hydrocodone. Tramadol is not as addicting or liable to get you hooked. It takes 2 hours for it to work to its fullest. The hydrocodone, takes 1 hour to work to its fullest. There are lots more meds, but I do not know how they work or if they take a long time. Muscle relaxers help and valium helps. Maybe someone will reply in the am. If you are going to a doctor, it is best not to suggest a certain type of pain meds. Most doctors do not like that. They think you are searching for drugs. Just sort of work with them and talk to them and tell them what you have already taken and why it did not work. Sorry, that I cannot be of more help. You may want to go to the pain board. Wannabe",

      "Content": "Hi Tigger, It sounds like you have a very thorough doctor and technician and breast diagnositc doctor. That is very good that they were able to do things so fast and all in one place! I had a breast lump, that was detected by a yearly mammogram. I then had to go a week later (sooner than most can), to a place 1 hour away and have the diagnostic spot compression mammogram and the ultrasound. I was very lucky and it was small and went away by itself! Try not to be scared. I know that is hard. I was afraid, waiting for my 2nd mammogram. But, my technician did that too. My lump was in one specific spot, and she checked all of both of my breasts, just to be sure. I think that is just a precaution that they do to most everyone. Just try to keep very, very busy and maybe the time will pass more quickly. It does help a little. Good Luck and report back to us. We care about you. Take care. Wannabe",

      "Content": "Hi PaulCindy, I have lumpy breasts also. One of my doctors called it fibrocystic breasts. They must know the difference between abnormal breast lumps and our regulard lumps! Just make sure that you have your 40th year mammogram. If you are really concerned or scared about it, go and get gynocologist appointment. The doctor will be able to tell what is what. Take care and try not to worry so much. I know it is hard. Wannabe",

      "Content": "Hi Everyone, I am almost 55 yrs. old. I just had my yearly mammogram about 2 wks ago. All my other mammograms have been fine. I do have fibrocystic breasts (lumpy), so I cannot tell - and hardly ever check - if I have lumps. Anyway, my drs. office called and said the dr. (gyno) wants to talk to me about my mammogram. This has never happened b4. If he wanted another regular slide of a mammo. from another angle, he would have just said so. What reasons do drs. call you in for concerning your mammograms? I have to wait til monday to go and find out. Any answers or thoughts would be very helpful. Also, if any of you would reply with any stories or anything that I could look up and therefore be semi-prepared for this dreaded dr. visit!!! :< Do they do anything between a mammogram and a biopsy? How are biopsys done - in dr. office or outpatient or what? I am going wacko thinking and waiting! Please reply with any info. Thanks Wannabe",

      "Content": "Hi there, Thanks Stavia and GingerTea, Your information and stories helped me a lot! Thanks for talking. I do not feel less anxious, but do feel some better because I am now more knowledgable! And I know that lots of other people go thru the same thing. I hope you have good results on your procedures gingertea. And Stavia, I hope your dr. says all is good and not to come back for awhile! So I might have to have a diagnostic mammogram and a breast Ultrasound. Then it goes from there. Either a biopsy/needle apiration or ? I should take it one step at a time and start with the dr. Then I can probably have the 1st 2 things next week also. It is just 2 doors down from my gyno. and not too busy, usually! Thanks again ladies. I will report back next week after the dr. appt. This weekend, I will research the net. Probably should not, as it might scare me more, but I do seek out as much info as I can about health problems (mine and my relatives). Take care. Wannabe",

I am sure that I will at least have an aspiration. I am a little freaked, but so far, it is controllable. Just do not want to do much of anything, but I know I should keep myself busy! My nervousness is bubbling just below the surface and comes out every now and then!!! :< I will report back this weekend. Hope that it is good news. Thanks again. Wannabe",

      "Content": "Hi Everyone, Hopefully this is my last update on this topic. I have no problems/no cancer of the breast. The Spot/Compression mammogram was done 1st. They had my picture/old (film on the wall) and the tech. only took 1 picture. It was of the one area and they did press harder. But to me, it did not hurt, much. When the tech came back from developing that one, she said it looked like a lymph node! Then I went down the short hall in my lovely \"shirt\" to the ultrasound room. A different technician did the breast ultrasound. Had to lay on my right side and raise my left arm over my head. She greased me up - mostly under my left arm and then on the left upper quarter of my left breast. She checked me out thoroughly and I watched the screen. She took 6 pictures. She took them out for the doctor to see and they both came back in. The dr. said, that she and the technician could not see a thing. Just normal breast tissue. She thinks that when they did the spot/compression, that my lump, flattened out (it was only 1 cm). I did ask them about a black spot I saw several times on the screen, and they said that was a blood vessel?!!! I guess that tells you not to guess at what you think it might be. Just wait and let them tell you what it is or is not! They did have all my mammograms to compare the new ones to. And I looked at my last one, from October. There was a white spot on there, so something was there, and I am very glad that I went to get it all checked out! And I am very happy that I am past that! At least for this year!!! :> They will send the report to my gyno dr. and he will either call me or tell me to come in. So I will have to wait til sometime next week! Keep having your mammograms, ladies. I had my 1st one when I was 40. Then one every 2 years. When I turned 50, I had 1 every year. It really helps the technicians to have something to compare your new ones to. And if I had cancer, it would have caught it early enuf, I think. Take care. Wannabe",

      "Content": "Hi Ladies, Thanks for your replies. I appreciate your help. GingerTea, how long did it take b4 they called you after your mammogram? Did they just say to come in and talk about it or any further info? Of course, you found the lump. I felt nothing but all sizes of lumps (bumpiness) and not tenderness. Is your lump tender? When my gyno examines my breasts at my regular yearly exam, he did hesitate on one side, but I guess, then went on because he knew I was fixing to have my yearly mammogram. One more thing. It might make a difference in what my dr. has me do (diagnostic wise), because I have a $5,000. deductible. And he knows that unless it is absolutely necessary, to hold off until the 1st of next year. I thought we were going to get away with only paying around 2,000 - 2,500 this year. But, if I have to have several tests, I just might make it! This health insurance is driving us to the poor house!!! Ok, so any more ideas or answers and such? Anyone? Thanks in advance for the help. Take care. Wannabe",

      "Content": "Hi everyone/anyone, I know, I have been posting on someone elses thread, talking to gingertea, but here are some questions that I need answered. Some history: I went to my gynocologist yesterday, because he called me to talk about my mammogram (yearly). My husband went with me for support. The doctor said that my breasts were very dense and that I had a 1cm node in my upper left quadrant of my left breast. He wanted me to get a diagnostic/compression mammogram and a breast ultrasound. One hospital I could go to, would take 3 weeks to get in and the other one that is 1 hr. away (Hermann Hospital/Houston) would take 1 week. I chose the 1 hr. away one. I called and they gave me an appointment on Friday!!! It is sort of a relief (not as long to go beserk) to get it done so fast! Also, when each procedure is done, if needed and if they can or have room, they can go ahead and do either the needle aspiration or a nodule/lump biopsy in the same day! Would be nice!! These are my questions: Does a compression/diagnostic mammogram hurt? I hear that they squash your breast a lot harder. And do they do it with the same type of machine as a yearly mammogram? Also, is a breast ultrasound done the same way a abdominal ultrasound is? Or is it different? More ?s: If needed, does a needle aspiration hurt much? Do they give you pain or valium meds? Is it a big needle? And, how does a lump/nodule biopsy work? Does it hurt, do they give you pain meds or valium? I would appreciate any answers, stories or help. Thanks in advance. Wannabe",

      "Content": "Hi Gingertea, If I were you, I would keep the appt. with the surgeon. And, I would want a biopsy, just to make me feel better about the lump and to make sure it is benign. I have heard that some go away by themselves. But, I am a big scaredy cat and would have to make for sure that it was not cancer!!! But, that is just my opinion. And you used the word \"probably\" a lot. Probably - leaves something to the imagination and is not a for sure \"not\". Because your lump is large, I would not wait 6 months to go back. If you wait any time at all, only wait 3 mo. Do not take any chances - in case it does grow! Take care of you. Hopefully someone that has had this before will reply. Wannabe",
