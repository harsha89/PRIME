    "Content": "A few months ago while during my period, I noticed my left breast became really tender/sore and then being the paranoid one that I am, I started feelin around and noticed there were a couple lumps but could only be detected if I \"pinched\" on the right side of the left breast. I went to the doctor and asked him about it, he looked and did a breast exam and noticed nothing wrong. There's nothing coming out of the nipple, everything seems to be in order, except for these weird lumps that show up every now and then. They seem to have shown up once again and I noticed last night my left nipple was super tender for no reason and then today I noticed the breast is tender once again and then I felt and those lumps are in the same spot! I just had my period last week so I don't know if it's just something with my period as this seems to pop up whenever it's my 'monthly time'. HELP!",
