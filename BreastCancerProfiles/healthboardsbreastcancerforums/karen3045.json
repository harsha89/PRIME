      "Content": "I am in the same position. I am 31 years old. Maternal GM died of BC at an early age. Have taken BC most of my adult life, although I have had 3 kids and 2 years ago, twins. With that said I myself have found the same type of \"lump\" as you. I just came home from my mammography. They said it was inconclusive, so it was followed up with an ultrasound, which I was nervous about. The radiologist tech said it was determined Negative and to follow up with a biopsy with my doctor. Three hours later, my pcp called and scheduled my follow up appt for friday next week. I AM DUMBFOUNDED and anxious. SO what is it?? I hope your appts go well, am interested to see what it is deemed. I hope you keep in touch, your story hits home as we are virtually same age and predicament. Hugs!",

      "Content": "The waiting game is difficult. I am find it hard to deal with people who work at these places that I have been sent too. It seems like they are just so brash, and are used to dealing with this sort of thing, so they are more cold. I said \"my mammogram came back negatives? As in it found nothing?\" As she just repeated her exact sentence 1\"the radiologist said your mammogram came back negative. you need to discuss this with your pcp\"... No feeling at all. I just don't understand how it can be \"neg\" is I have a definite lump at about 7 oclock just underneath my nipple!!! SO wth is it??? I hope when you go into your appt you take no bs!! They work for us so we should be satisfied. What state do you live in? Are u just discussing this with your pcp or an actual breast specialist?",
