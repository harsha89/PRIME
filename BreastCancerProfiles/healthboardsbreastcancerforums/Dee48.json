    "Content": "Was diagnosed with stage 2 breast cancer in 2006. Have been on Arimidex for over a year now and have been one of the lucky ones. While I do have the muscle and joint aches at times it's certainly not as bad as some. Had a bone density test before I started and will Caltrate and the gym 3 times a week bones actually improved, yes improved. Not much mind you, just a point. I would have been happy if they stayed the same, but was ecstatic with this news. Has anyone else tried the Caltrate, twice daily and seen results?",
