      "Content": "Six months ago my lymph node on the left side of my neck grew abnormally large. After many go arounds with the Drs and a needle biopsy that it was \"abnormal\" and needed to be removed. At that time I had swelling under my left arm pit as well and ultrasounds came back that I had several inflamed lymph nodes but not they were not \"abnormally\" large. There was also one cyst n my left breast that I have had in the area for years. January 2012 I was to have the neck node removed but my insurance was cancelled. Three weeks ago I noticed that my breast have become very heavy. My left breast is noticeably larger then the right and as of last week I have an uncomfortable and noticeably large lump in my left breast that is causing my nipple to pull...the skin is starting to dimple like a orange and the soreness is not going away. It is more of a flattish lump. I need talking out of my tree or I need advise. I am on state insurance and can't imagine what substandard care I am going to receive.",

      "Content": "Update: Mammogram and ultrasound shows a band of \"dense\" breast tissue, but no tumors. I spoke with my old OBGYN and from California and she said based on my abnormal needle biopsy of my enlarged left neck lymph node I am to \"run do not walk\" to get it out and tested for a host of issues. Some of which are: -Hodgkin's or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma -Inflammatory breast cancer -Pancreatic cancer -Lots of issues related to lymph or immunity See the head and neck guy on the 10th...wish me luck. P.S. she said if the neck lymph node was benign then I would have been OK and to have a recheck mammogram in six months...cancer travels everywhere...but if it was a head cold or infection it would have traveled down to the node...not up. Thanks for the support!",

      "Content": "Today's update: three friends have \"felt\" me up...I am not halucinating...this thing is actually in my breast...they all point the enlarged lymph no side in my neck and look at me weird. I am getting hugs from the girls and my mom in freaking me out. Everyone has said the same two things: either go to the ER right now or go see a Doctor first thing in the morning. So alright, I guess I am not feeling 100% lately. Lethargic and off my sleep routine but does all this make me have breast cancer? Maybe it is just mastitis or a benign cyst?",
