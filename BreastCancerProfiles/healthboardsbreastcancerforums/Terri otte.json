    "Content": "Just had lumpectomy in Dec. Did not have clear margins. Had 2nd ssurgery to get clear margins which was sucessfull. My problem is nerve pain. I had only one lymph node and my Dr. says it is very unusual to have nerve pain from just one node removed. But, that said, I do have pain that will not go away with my pain meds, which is vicodin. Doe anyone know what I can take for this? I have read about some anti-depressants and anti-seisure meds being good for nerve pain. The type of pain I feel is like I have a bad burn on my skin under arm and around the breast. It really hurts to just lightly touch the skin.",
