Thats when early breast cancer was discovered.I was lucky as my mammogram wasn't due for another 2yrs. I had a lumpectomy and 1 lymph node had started to become infected.Chemo and radiotherapy followed.Ididn't mind the radio because i felt the benefits out weighed the after effects.Iam on tamoxifen and have been fine apart from the hot flushes and i am now on herceptin as my cancer was her2 positive.We tend not to have second opinions here. Ijust put all my faith in the oncologist i was given . I hope everything works out for you .Keep us posted. I will be thinking of you best wishes phyl41",

They can seemingly do that and it still has the same effect on the cancer cells that is if there are any remaining after surgery. Its a lot to take in isn't it They also cut the number of blasts of radiotherapy to save me to much discomfort. So they can do alot to help Well enough depressing talk, have a lovely weekend and keep in touch best wishes phyl41",
