    "Content": "Second opinion. I found a lump in my breast which after the biopsy, turned out to be Fibroadenomas. But the doctor said they found \"Florid Ductal Hyperplasia with Atypia\" in my cells outside of the lump (not related to the lump) in my breast tissues. He then said that I need a mastectomy. I think this is crazy. I don't even have cancer. He said it is the precursor to the precursor before cancer. I live in a real small country town and obviously I'm not going to have him do this to me. I am a 42 year woman with no breast cancer history in my family. I called the nearest major city and the doctor wont see me for a second opinion because a surgeon already cut me open (biopsy). The receptionist said that that was the policy there. I would think this is illegal. I guess the doctors have some sort of code or something. Anyways that city is next to my small country town so it's pretty country itself, it's known as \"Cow Town\". You guys probably know what city I'm talking about. So I'm going to try the largest city near it and see if they will see me or just wait until I move back to California because I called there and they give second opinions. Have any of you guys heard of having a mastectomy for \"Florid Ductal Hyperplasia with Atypia\"? Or a doctor not willing to give a second opinion? Now I don't even believe I have what the doctor said.",
