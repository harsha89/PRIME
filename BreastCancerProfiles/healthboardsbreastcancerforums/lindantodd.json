      "Content": "Hi, Thank you so much for asking. Good news and bad news, my right breast does not have cancer cells, it was a 7x5x3mm mass and because it was irregular it was concerning, but my left breast has a lesion that is 5mm and they wanted to biopsy immediately because this one is highly suspcious, I am out of town till April 19th and they didn't want me to go, I decided to go and so I am having that biopsy on April 20th. How are you doing and how did our doctors appoitment go??? Praying that it went well.",

      "Content": "I had mammogram that came back fine in January, I noticed a couple of weeks ago pain in my breasts so I went to the doctor, had another mammogram that was fine but ultrasound showed suspicious solid mass and getting a core biopsy tomorrow. I have had a milky discharge for the last ten years and went to breast specialist and had it checked out and it was fine, but noticed it has changed color to a green/grey. The pain is totally gone. I do have an aunt onn both sides that have had breast cancer. Just found all this out last friday and tomorrow getting core biopsy and this waiting is aweful. So my question is, what makes a solid mass suspicious, can the radiologist see things that make it suspicious, like the shape of a mass? Im hoping the results come back quick, waiting is so hard. Thanks to everyone!",

      "Content": "Thank you so much, biospy went great, nothing to it, no pain. I have been told by many that a discharge is very common and usually does not mean cancer. I had mine checked years ago and it was fine, I went to the doctor because I noticed it wasn't the same milky color. I should have the results in 3-6 days and I feel such relife that it is done. I actually think the waiting and just wanting to get it down has been the worst. I am hoping for the best, but prepared for the worst. I wish you all the very best, prayers and thoughts will be with you for good results, Linda",
