      "Content": "Fortunately, he was just calling to tell me that nothing unusual came back other than my cholesterol. Not sure if that means that the lump is nothing to worry about or if I should be worried because it means I am probably not fighting an infection. I go back in two weeks to see him so I guess I'll see what he wants to do from that point. Thanks for the suggestion.",

      "Content": "Well, although no one has answered, I'm still hoping that this may catch the eye of someone who will post. I saw my doctor Tuesday and he says that it's probably an ingrown hair but wants to get my blood and have me come back in a month to check it out again; either way, if it were to get bigger, I am to call him or if my blood comes back suspect, he will call me. I was somewhat relieved but not totally convinced and this morning, while I was in the shower, I found another lump on the bottom portion of my breast and compared it to the other one...no lump there. I will call him Monday but am also concerned that I am being too paranoid about it. I can't feel either of these when I'm not wet and soapy and, although the one in my armpit (outer part of my arm) is easily spotted in the shower, the one under my breast, you still have to feel for, even when wet. I have to admit that I'm not faithful about examining my breasts like I should be so I'm not sure if it's a normal lump or something to be concerned about. Maybe I don't need advice since I do know what I should and will be doing and I know no one can tell me if it is or isn't cancer. I guess I'm just looking for encouragement or experience in the same situation. I just fear the worst and by worst, I mean exactly that.",

      "Content": "No biopsy yet. We were \"watchful waiting\" but I called back to get in earlier than the month he had planned because I'm waiting to see a surgeon for neck surgery and don't want to have this hanging over my head in the meantime. I'm going in Thursday and I'm going to ask him to aspirate it or send me for ultrasound. I haven't been sleeping because I'm having very bad anxiety attacks and I just want this to be over. Not sure what the swelling was all about since it went down the very next day but my blood came back normal so I'm assuming that means I don't have an infection. Maybe I've been irritating the area by checking all the time.",

      "Content": "Two weeks ago I was in the shower and while I was washing under my arm, I found two pea-sized lumps under my arm. Both seem solid but movable. I have a hard time feeling them when I'm not showering but when I'm all soapy they are easily detected. I have an appt. for Tuesday and didn't get in sooner because I was going on vacation. The doc. asked questions like did I had a temp. or do I feel sick, etc. before making the judgment that it would be safe to wait until I returned home. Now that I am almost home, the worry has started back up and have been reading everything I can find about whether this could be cancer (breast or otherwise). I just turned 45 and have other known risks such as overweight, had menses at age 10, never had children and a former smoker. In my gut, I don't feel like it's cancer but I don't want to be blind-sided if it were to turn out to be so. Has anyone been diagnosed with cancer who has found an under-arm lump or have you felt a lump that is hard to feel while dry but easily felt in shower? I'm afraid my doctor might have a problem locating it. If you've discovered a lump under your arm or could feel a lump in the shower but have a hard time locating it otherwise, I really would like to hear from you. Any insight would be greatly appreciated positive or negative!! Thanks, Janet",

      "Content": "Update, had my blood taken last weekend and yesterday my doctor left a message on my voicemail that just asked me to call them back. Unfortunately, by the time I got it, the office is closed until Monday. I noticed that my whole arm pit is slightly swollen now and the lump I found is still there. Of course, normally it's a good thing but this weekend is going very slowly and I'm very worried about what the doctor could have found in my blood report. I know he did a CBC and something else but not sure what the other test was. Does anyone know if there is anything that can be detected in a complete blood count or if there's any other test that would make him suspicious about cancer? I know that I should just not worry about it and wait until Monday but that's easier said than done.",
