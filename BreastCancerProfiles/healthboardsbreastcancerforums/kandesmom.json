    "Content": "Hi! I am 37, lump in inner part of armpit...and 8 years ago I hade a total hysterectomy. Then, 3 years ago, I had a pea size lump (non painful) in my inner armpit I asked the doc about it and he said it was probably from an ingrown hair. However, this \"lump has been consistently growing, and four days ago, I awoke to feeling like my armpit was on fire. The lump that has been growing is now a golf ball size lump. I went to doc that morning, due to the pain radiating down into my breast, and they ordered a mammogram, breast ultrasound, as well as a bone density test due to an unexplained tailbone fracture. These tests are next Friday. The doc also prescribed an antibiotic, as I have lost a significant amount of weight (intentionally) and the excess skin causes skin irritations, as she want to be certain any infection is cleared up there as well. Furthermore, she did refer me to the surgeon for that problem\u0085.Now, after seeing the doc 3 days ago, the lump is still very large, but appears to have a very small amount of puss draining. My question is could this (boil/abscess) be growing for 3 years, or is this just a problem from the original lump? Please can someone help me with some answers, as in all honesty, I am scared, and going out of my mind.",
