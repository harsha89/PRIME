    "Content": "It's ironic in a way but I went to the dr insisting on a mammogram because my right breast felt more dense, it hurt a bit, and I felt an uncomfortableness in my armpit. They did a mammo and an ultrasound.. and found nothing. My right breast was fine.. they did discover a lump in my left breast though. They're pretty sure it's benign so I\"m hoping. I go for surgery this thursday. i don't want to scare you but have you had a mammogram lately?",
