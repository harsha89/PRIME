    "Content": "I can relate to what you're going thru. I had biopsy of a mass in two of my breast. But I've been getting mid back pain and pain under my armpit. I am seeing a chiro and went for physical therapy. It helped me, but I am always concerned if I'm just covering the problem. Docs tell me that shoulder and mid back pain can be stress related. So, maybe you are like me and are worrying about the breast and that is why we are feeling all these pains. I have to agree the age has a factor I am 39 going to be 40 in two months and this has been the year for me where every doc has seen me. Try to not worry so much and maybe even consider a chiro. Good luck.",
