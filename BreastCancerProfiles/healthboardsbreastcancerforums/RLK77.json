      "Content": "Thanks for the advice! I'm trying hard not to worry even though the results came back ok. My gyno did tell me that I have a lot of cystic lumps in my left breast(more than my right) and the tech doing the ultrasound said I have a lot too. Could that be the reason for the clear discharge- fibrocystic breast disease?",

      "Content": "Starting in July I developed severe anxiety that was pretty bad for about 2 months. During a breast exam, a clear discharge came out of my left nipple. The discharge was completely clear and was liquidy (like a tear). A small drop or two continued to come out over the next few weeks only when I squeezed. I made an appointment with my gyno for a complete physical (I was due). She said (as did my other gyno when I was in my teens) that I have fibrocystic breasts- especially in my left breast where the discharge happened. But she took a smear of the discharge, sent me for an ultra sound and took a cbc and tested for my prolactin level (my prolactin level was slightly high the year before). All the test came out fine, no growths, no problems with my ducts or inflamation, prolactin was normal and the sample of the discharge came back fine. The girl doing my ultra sound said she saw a lot of fibrocystic tissue in my breast. My doctor said that it could be stress related and to stop messing with it. I have pretty bad health anxiety and once I believe I have a disease or problem I start to develop symptoms. Which could be why my breasts weren't sore until I saw the discharge. I am still kind of worried about it because it still releases discharge when messed with and since I found the discharge it has been painful off and on. I am 25 years old and have been on birth control for a little over a year. My mother was diagnosed with stage 1 breast cancer at age 59. She also had discharge (think and yellowish) but her smear came back abnormal. They believe her cancer was related to her being on an estrogen patch for 12 years. My question is do you think the discharge/pain could be related to severe stress from the anxiety, the birth control pill (loestrin 24) or the fibrocystic disease? My insurance isn't too good so I don't want to have more tests if ultra sounds are pretty accurate. Thanks for all your help!",

      "Content": "Glad to hear you're ok. Wondering about the discharge though.... have you had it in only one breast? Or both? And does it occur only when you squeeze? Just seems weird to me that it's happening in only one breast. But the doctor says I have more fibrocystic tissue in that breast so I'm assuming that could be the reason? I should have asked..",

      "Content": "No other symptoms. At times I think the nipple with the discharge is sometimes a little more swollen.. but it could just be my head playing games because I'll look again 10 minutes later and its fine. I did already have an ultra sound, smear, blood work in the summer and all tests came back good. No masses, blocked ducts, inflammation, etc. I didn't know if I should have anymore tests or if those are pretty much the procedure. Also didn't know if birth control pills, stress, fibrocystic breasts could be doing this to just one breast?",
