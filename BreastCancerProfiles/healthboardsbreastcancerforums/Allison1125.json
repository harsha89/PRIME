      "Content": "for the past 5 days i've been having pain in my right breast. its not sore at all, just this constant pain on 1 side of the breast that seems to get worse each day. yesterday i started getting this cold feeling inside where the pain is. it was on & off all day. but today its been pretty constant. i feel as if i have had an ice pack on my breast for hours. you know that feeling you get in a muscle when you ice it? thats what it feels like & its really freaking me out. i have an appt with my gyn tomorrow...hoping its nothing but i'm quite concerned. i'm not sure if this is the right place to post this question so i'm sorry if it is not. the thing thats getting me paranoid is my mom had pain in her breast & everyone she knew who had breast cancer told her not to worry because breast cancer never hurts. she never felt a lump so she waited to get checked out thinking it was just a pulled muscle. well it turned out to be breast cancer and by that point she had lymph node involvement. she passed away in october, just 2 & 1/2 years after her diagnosis. so i'm definitely getting this checked out tomorrow. i was just curious if anyone has had anything like this happen to them before. this feeling is so strange. any comments would be greatly appreciated!",

      "Content": "thanks smithn! so i went to my dr & she said she didnt feel anything which made me feel better. funny, the 1st thing she asked me was if i had been taking in more caffeine (which i havent). i am on birth control pills & have been having some problems with them so she switched me to a different pill. maybe that will help? well anyways, she said that if i'm still having the pain after my period that i should come back for some tests. the pain is so much worse today though! i feel terrible...have a lot of trouble sleeping. i cant wait for this to go away! thanks for the post!",
