    "Content": "I have been on Arimidex for 2 mos. now. This past week I have been feeling extremely sore! I have also been getting pain in my elbows. I was diagnosed in Jan. of this year with stage 1 DCIS, ER, PR +, her2neg and neg nodes. Had a lumpectomy and 33 rounds of radiation. Is the soreness going to be around for the next 5 years or is it temporary? My mood swings are really getting bad. I feel for my husband! Some days I'm happy as a lark then I'm crying and so depressed! HELP! Thanks! CK",
