      "Content": "Hi, Just a general question: If anyone reading this has been diagnosed with breast cancer, had you first experienced pain in/near armpit and wonder if it was just the tendons and ligaments? And pain extending down into the ribs? If you have got such a diagnosis, I am sorry if this question troubles you. Thanks for reading.",

      "Content": "I clicked on your post because my mother first had some shooting pains before finding a lump, but she's yet to see the doctor. Anyhow, when you talked about the pain in the chest it reminded me of something I've had recently (within the past few months). I had a whole slew of symptoms that are posted elsewhere and for me, I think the problem that caused this weird chest pain and then ongoing pain in my chest was actually the depo provera injection. I'd been on it for a few months but after the third shot, that's when all kinds of issues started. I've been off all contraception for about a month now (skipped my last shot) and my symptoms are decreasing and no chest pain (no more than normal random pains everyone gets at some point). I am a good decade plus older than you, but if problems persist, please see the doctor. You are your healthcare advocate, so if something doesn't seem right for you, please follow it up - even if they think it's nothing. You know your body. You live with it every day. I hope all is well.",
