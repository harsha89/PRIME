      "Content": "I myself am a breast cancer survivor.....and I had a false sense of security after going ten years NED......my mom was only 27 when she was given only six months to live because she had a mass as big as a grapefruit, her fifth and sixth rib were involved, and she had 21 positive lymphnodes positive! She had a radical mastectomy and experimental treatments performed on her along with two years of chemotherapy! She survived and 21 years later got it in second breast, but once again beat it! A few months ago she noticed what looked like an ingrown hair in her armpit! It grew into like a small cyst surgeon was sure it was a type of skin cancer, came back the other day Breast Cancer!!!! Growing on the outside of her skin in her armpit???? Now waiting for Medicare to approve a PET scan! But scared to death for her, 35 years, so sad! Our type of cancer is BRCA1 +, and we are Er- PR-, HER2-, triple negatives.....I am just in shock I guess, and just eagerly awaiting her PET scan, please please say a prayer for my mom Carol.....thank you!!!!",
