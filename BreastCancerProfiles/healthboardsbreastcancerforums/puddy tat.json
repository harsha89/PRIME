      "Content": "I know you are afraid and you have already been through a lot. You need to contact your doctor now and get the lump checked out. The unknown can often be more frightening than just dealing with whatever it turns out to be. Take a friend with you to the appointment for moral support. Mammograms are uncomfortable, but they are not as painful as you are imagining. Remember that your doctor is part of your team and you are in charge of the team! Your team can't help you, if they don't know what is going on.",

      "Content": "It sounds like you are scaring yourself to death with all your expectations. A mammogram uncomfortaable, but is nothing that you cannot handle. A biopsy is uncomfortable, but nothing you cannot handle. Find something else to do/think about until your appointments so that you don't have to make yourself anxious. You will discover that the worst part of it is the fear you give yourself. You can do this and more if you need to. Believe in yourself.",
