      "Content": "On my 2nd annual mammogram I received a letter to come back for a diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound because a \"NEW\" focal, asymmetric density was seen on left breast and requires further evaluation. After receiving this letter, I am able to palpate a lump at 6:00, which is where letter described. Yesterday, I went in and had the DX mammo and ultrasond. I gues they still don't know what it is because I came in later in the day to have core biopsy (they were able to fit me in). I am now awaiting the results and I feel as though I have been experiencing other symptoms of breast cancer. I have been abnormally tired for a while now but have been able to rationalize. In the past couple of days, I have noticed that the breast in question has looked a bit different to me. The nipple looks like it's filled with milk even though I have not breast fed for 6 years. Also, there is a raised area on the areola on the left side below the nipple that was not there before. If I squeeze the nipple, discharge comes out. Should this be a concern or could it be related to PMS? I asked the Dr. doing the Core biopsy if she had a feeling about what this could be and she said she thinks it is just some benign, dense tissue. Could anyone please respond. I really can't talk much about this because I don't want to upset family and friends if it is only benign, dense tissue. Meanwhile, I am worrying myself sick. Thanks so much!",
