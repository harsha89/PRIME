      "Content": "ok, well, I have a question.... I don't have ALL the symptoms listed for IBC, but do have a few. I have the ichy nipple, discharge, pain, lumpy feeling, and my breast has gotten a bit larger, and more solid. I had a mamogram, which they said showed cysts, which look benign. But, I made an appointment with a surgeon anyway, because of these symptoms, and my question is----what do I ask the surgeon? Am I suppose to ask for a biopsy, or will the surgeon tell me if he thinks its necasary? These symptoms are not getting worse, except the pain is more noticable. Am I just looking for trouble? Thanks for any info you all would have. diane",

      "Content": "rushell, my appointment yesterday went well. I really liked the surgeon, and felt like he was truely listening to me. He said that I have several issues and none of them point to ibc. I have no history of breast cancer in the family, and also, my symptoms have not changed quickly, like ibc would. So, he agreed that I need to go off the hormone pills, which I have been taking for 2 1/2 years. I need to take about 4 months to go off, and also, cut back on the caffeen, as he believes I have that fibercystic disease. He says I will feel much better w/o the hormones, because it makes the pain in the breasts worse. (he doesn't know how I am w/o hormones, so we shall see WHO feels better) So, I feel a whole lot better now,anyway, just talking to him. He also said, If anything changes, call him right away. So, there ya go. Let me know what you find out too, please. thanks for asking about me diane",

      "Content": "Rushell, Thanks for the response. I have an appointment with the surgeon tomorrow, so will let you know what he says. I think, with something like this, I would rather know for sure what is going on. And if its not some kind of cancer, I want to know what there is to treat it. My doctor wants me to go off my hormone pills, but take a few months to do it, so that may help. Whatever the surgeon decides to do, it doesn't sound fun at all. I don't know anything about any biopsies. So, let me know what you find, also, please. And what's your weather been like in PE....I live about 20 miles from Trail, BC diane",
