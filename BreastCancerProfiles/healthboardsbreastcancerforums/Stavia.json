      "Content": "I had an abnormal mammogram for the first time last month. The hospital where I had it done called me the next day to tell me and to schedule a diagnostic mammogram and an ultrasound. Neither my doctor nor I had felt any lumps. I had the diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound done 2 days ago. The ultrasound tech was very chatty so I took advantage of that and asked a lot of questions. According to the tech, ultrasounds, unlike mammograms, are very good at distinguishing between cysts and solid masses. Cysts are not and don't become cancerous, wheresas solid masses may or may not be cancerous. Biopsies are done to determine whether a solid mass is cancerous or not. I was told before I left the hospital that I had a cyst and that nothing needed to be done about it unless it became painful; then it could be aspirated. I'm waiting to talk to my doctor now; I think I'll feel more comfortable if he confirms the \"nothing needs to be done\" part. I don't know if this helps at all; just thought I'd relay my experience. Good luck and try not to worry. I keep hearing that the overwhelming majority of abnormalities are benign.",

      "Content": "I haven't had a needle aspiration or a biopsy, but I can tell you about my diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound. My diagnostic mammogram was done on the same machine as the screening mammogram. They took one shot that was exactly like the shots they take for screening; it didn't feel any different than the screening shots. They also took 2 shots using different \"plates\" (I'm not sure what they're called); the \"plates\" were smaller and they felt more comfortable to me. I always find mammograms pretty uncomfortable, so this was a relief. The ultrasound was just like a pelvic or abdominal ultrasound. It didn't hurt a bit. It's good that you were able to get an appointment quickly. I had to wait a week for mine and then on the morning of the appointment the hospital called to reschedule me for 5 days later. The longer I waited, the more ridiculous my mental state became. Good luck on Friday ! I'll be thinking of you.",
