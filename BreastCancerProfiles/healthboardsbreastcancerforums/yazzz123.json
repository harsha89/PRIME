    "Content": "I found two lumps on my right breast. I have a lot of stretch marks from breastfeeding two children and im wondering, can these be like scar tissue from the stretch marks? I got an ultrasound done but nothing was found. im going to follow up with doctor in a week to see if she still fells them. I also want to mention that I have enlarged lymph nodes above my left clavicle. Could they be related? I got biopsy done on my lymph nodes but came back negative, but they are still there. any advice?",
