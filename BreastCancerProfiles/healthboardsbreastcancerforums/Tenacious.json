      "Content": "Yes, I know people are fallable, another reason I QUESTION mammogram machines & the dosage they all claim. We would never know really....They are supposed to be checked peridocally by professionals to assure the machines are using the proper low dose of radiation, but who really knows. I would love to go to a higher tech faciltry for my Ultrasound, but I guess I need to wait and see what this Surgeun recommends to me, if maybe this regular mammogram will pick something up this time.",

      "Content": "Thank you for your reply, I did end up calling the same surgeon that did my last Biopsy (when I was still pregnant & miscarried) and somehow talked the nurse into allowing me to come & talk to him-she admitted it is no law that I had to have the mammogram, Luckily my Health insurance changed so I didn't need a referral. As long as I can get this Suregeun to FEEL what I feel, I imagine he can do the Biopsy. I WANT the Biopsy--just not the mammogram. I am still getting the Ultrasound next week BEFORE seeing this Surgeun. I imagine it will show nothing again. But maybe not. And I will be bringing my Mamogram results from 2 years ago to the surgeun also. Yes, I do have a fear of X-rays, if you punch in \"Mammograms Radiation Satety\" on Google and start reading some of the stuff I read, EVEN IF HALF of it is true, I still don't want mammograms at my age. Now if I was over 45 yrs or after Menopause, I have no problem with this screening-every year or so. If I didnt have one at 35 yrs, I would get one now, I just don't see the need 2 years later if nothing has changed. But that is my situation. I know they DO catch cancers that CAN'T be felt. I would never deny that. Just like alot of things in life, I think they can be Over used. Just like some Dentists give every single person who walks into their practice a dental X-ray. This is completely unnecessasry. I will not allow my children to get a Dental X-ray until they have a cavity or really need that service. I take it your cancer was of the FAST growing kind -since you was very young. I read somewhere those can double in like 21 days, even getting a mammogram at the perfect time can only give you about 6 days warning -until it can be felt doing a self breast check. Have you heard this, or is that Hype --probably another site that recommended Mammograms can be dangerous to Premenapausal women. ?? Thanks",

      "Content": "I hope Kalie comes back on here, what is your \"Story\", how did you find yours --by yourself, your doctor, a Mammogram -and was the mammogram of any value beings women's breasts are so much denser when we are younger? Did you have others in your family with Breast cancer, and how are you doing now ?? I am not familair with all the stages or what they mean exactly. My Obgyn told me 80% of the time, women are getting breast cancer & they have no family history. This is very scary to me. I don't have the family history, but I know my eating habits have way too much fat & this is not healthy. And I had A-typical cells with Biopsy 4 years ago, it was Fibrystic tissue. What are your feelings to why some women come down with this at such young ages? Any advice to all of us? .... Please share , I hope you are doing well.",

      "Content": "I am 37 yrs old. I had a mammogram 2 years ago along with an ultrasound for a small something or other near my breastbone that my gynocologist did not feel, I has been there for years, it was just bugging me. I wanted to do this before I had my 5th child -just to easy my worries. SO the mammogram showed nothing & the ultrasound showed nothing. And 2 years BEFORE this -when I was 33, I had a small lump removed from the other breast -because a fine needle aspiration showed A-typical cells, at least the Gynocologist could feel that one. It wasn't cancer. I have no family history of cancer either. I never did have a mammogram for that Biopsy (most likely because I was pregnant at the time, I ended up miscarrying a week before the biopsy). Anyway, NOTHING has changed since this last mammogram but again, it is bugging me that nothing showed on these tests. I really WANT a Biopsy, but DO NOT want to expose myself to MORE Radiation that will show NOTHING. I am very distrubed by what Radiation can do -with all the reading I have been doing about Premenapausal women exposiong themselves to Mammograms. So I went to another OBGYN who didn't feel anything (again) & feels I SHOULD get another mammogram & Ultrasound, that he thinks every women should get a yearly mammogram after 35 yrs, then in the next breath says He can't understand why SO many women, younger women are coming down with Breast cancer. IS there some kind of LAW that says a woman in her 30's MUST get a Mammogram in order to get something Biopsied ??? This is what I want to know. IF I just go to a Surgeun, will he respect my wishes that I only want an ultrasound ??? Surely I don't have to be pregnant (Like last time) in order to skip the mammogram. I did call the surgeun I went to last about this & the Secretary was VERY unfriendly & just said He will make me get a mammogram, that is their policy-before he will consider a biopsy- so I suppose I have to look elsewhere. Thanks for your help",
