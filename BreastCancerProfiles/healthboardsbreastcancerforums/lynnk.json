    "Content": "Hi Analee About 15 years ago I had the same thing, a small lump, and I was really worried so I trotted along to my doctor who examined me and told me and i quote \"that it was a sort of Mastitis - this means that the breasts are of an irregular rubbery consistency and contain painful or tender nodules or cysts, which feel lumpy. These nodules change with the menstrual cycle. This is not an inflammation, and the condition, which is common, is not a mastitis, but is known as benign mammary dysplasia, or fibrocystic disease. It is caused by an upset of the balance of the hormones that control the menstrual cycle and does not normally require treatment.\" So I reckon it could be the above but the only way to check it out is to go along to your GP if you are worried. Hope it all goes well and the best thing to do is not worry and keep smiling! Best wishes Lynn",
