      "Content": "I am 47 yrs old. I have been diagnoses with ADH. I have bc in my family history. I have had a biopsy for cysts. I have had a lumpectomy and removal of tissue. Doc suggested tamofin which i guess is not good since I am a smoker. Wed I go for a MRI., and Fri I go see a surgeon. Any suggestion on having preventive mastectomy.",
