    "Content": "Hi, I had my 8th mammogram 5 days ago, routine, I have had them before with the discomfort we all experience but this time was different. When she was putting me in \"position\" she yanked my left arm so hard this white hot pain shot across from my shoulder to above left breast. I cried out in surprise but I let her go on with the procedure. I then said I had pain on inhaling and she snidely asked me \"I thought you said it was your shoulder\". I explained it was the first reaction, (do all these radiologists take classes in condescension and superiority?) The pain has got worse now, its concentrated in the region above and to the left of breast and also in my neck and shoulder. It is there on inhaling and also when I cough of even blow my nose. Surely this can't be normal? As I said I have had the procedure before without incident. I wonder if anyone else has had this experience? I will not be back.",
