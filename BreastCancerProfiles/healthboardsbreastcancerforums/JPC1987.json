    "Content": "Hello everyone, I have a few questions about something I am currently experiencing and is causing me great anxiety. I am a 23 year old female who was diagnosed with fibrocystic breasts at 19 years old. Since then I basically just did a couple breast self exams a year and didn't really pay much attention to breast changes. About 4 months ago I gave birth to a baby boy at 18 weeks (he did not survive obviously) and have taken more interest in my breast health after my breasts were engorged following delivery. I've noticed some small (.5 cm to 1 cm), smooth, firm (what I think are) lymph nodes under my right armpit. My right breast is the most fibrocystic which is why I'm so concerned. I can only feel them when I palpitate the skin over my ribcage in my armpit. I can feeler some even smaller ones nearer to my breast. This phenomenon only really occurs in my right armpit/breast area. I can feel fibrous tissue in both armpits though. I don't know exactly when this started but I think I started noticing it after my son was born and my breasts went back to their normal size. If anyone could help me with any ideas on why this is happening, I would greatly appreciate it. I have developed a real fear of breast cancer which is exacerbated by the stress and emotional fatigue I've been experiencing these last 4 months. Thank you Jess",
