      "Content": "Hi Lori, First let me say that I will keep your Mom in my prayers. I never thought about it being a calcium deposit! It is rather large. I guess that I will find out at my doctor visit. I will update you on Thursday. Thank you for the support! I did find out that my Grandfather's sister had breast cancer, so it is down the line a bit. I am only 34, but I did have a mammogram when I was 28, because of a suspicious lump near my breast, that turned out ok. : Hugs, Panama",
