    "Content": "Hi Lizzy76 I've got a lump in my right breast, it started out as a painful mass so to speak. The mass is still there about 4cm but i've been pressing a little harder in the area and have found what I think is a lump with a sort of bumpy edge to it. I'm 32 and extremely worried, in fact its taken me 8 weeks to go to the doctor about it as i'm also being seen by a specialist at the moment for what I believe is Fibromyalgia. I'm always extremely tired and in pain etc so to find this lump really has made me rather nervous. Keep in touch and let me know how you get on..",
