I am a 4yr survivor..I had a mastectomy and 8rounds of chemotherapy..no radiation for me..I was stage IIb grade 3, Invasive ductual cancer with one positive lymph node..I have not had any evidence of disease since the original diagnosis..I have taken hormonal therapy and will continue that until I have a total of 5yrs on those. You have a very tough decision to make...have you gotten all of the information from your doctor as far as length of time..recovery..and side effects..How long do you have to make this decision? I wish you well on your upcoming surgery..when is that? Please come back and post Lady, let us know how you are doing, Okay? Bless you, hugs, cj.",

Can you tell me about your diagnosis? I had IDC estrogen only slightly positive, pr-,her2-, 33 nodes removed with one positive. I did ACT, adriamycin, cytoxin and taxotere, 8 rounds. I was then on tamoxifen ( given to premenopausal women who are estrogen +) for 2 and a half years..I was then switched to an AI (aromatose inhibitor) aromasin for one year, but because of undesirable side effects I have switched to another one of the AI's arimidex...have been on it for about a month and so far feeling better than when I was on aromasin..I will continue with this until I have completed a total treatment of 5yrs. and then see what is available at that time...there have been so many advances in breast cancer, survival rates are much better than they ever were..I plan on living a wonderful, long life! jojo, 4YRS have past, and I still cant believe that I have been through all of this..but there is life after cancer treatments..and I have so slowed myself down..and take time to smell each rose along the path..in that way, I feel very lucky..

I tried effexor, prescribed for me because of terrible hot flashes..it did work!, but I didnt care for the way it made me feel..very,very tired..but everyone is different..it may work better for you! I presently take elavil, its a mild antidepressant, I take it because I have alot of leg pain, most probably caused by chemo. It also helps with sleep...it had been working beautifully, until recently..as soon as summer is over I plan on going back to the rheumie who prescribed it and figure out what to do next! I hate taking medications also, so I know how you feel..but spending even part of the day, weepy and depressed isnt fair either! Do you, and can you exercise regularly? I make sure I get to the gym almost everyday, and it really helps! the endorphins your body makes while exercising really helps fight off depression..I feel much better after a good workout! Maybe if you dont already do it, you can start with some walking.. I wish you the best! stop in whenever you can and let us know how youre doing..okay? hugs, cj.",

Sorry that youve been diagnosed with this beast of a disease..but Beepie, they have come along way with treatments..many no longer get sick like they used to with chemo..many people even continue to work..I had some leg pains, mouth sores (which they have a wash to treat) and fatigue. I chose to have a mastectomy, but was told that I would do just as well with a lumpectomy..I didnt want to have radiation, which I would have had with a lumpectomy, and that is what I based my decision on..but everyone is different and there are no right or wrongs here..I say..just follow your gut..If your spiritual at all, a few prayers help too!! It took 6weeks to heal from the mast., at that time I chose not to have reconstruction, but did so 2yrs later when I had expanders put in which were later exchanged for an implant..if you choose a mast, and recon right away, they will perform a skin sparring surgery for you. Beepie, If you have any other questions, feel free to post, or if you just need to vent..you can do that too!! We all understand, weve at some point experienced those feeling too..

      "Content": "sure Beepie, Mine was 1.5cm, but according to my path report there was also another area, which apparently the mammo had not detected..after surgery my doc said \"its a good thing you choose a mast, because there was other cancer elsewhere\". Thats just my experience, everyone has their own, but just thought I should share that info with you.. I have read recently that women should have an mri following sugery, again this wasnt offered to me, but I can now understand what a positive that would be. Being that your cancer is hormone positive, which means that estrogen fed the tumor, allowing it to grow, they probably will put you on tamoxifen or one of the ai's, aromasin, arimidex or femara, all depending on whether you are pre or post menopausal at that time..some women talk an injection to shut ovarian production, and others like myself choose a hysterectomy. I stopped menstuating for over a year after chemo, thats why I started on tamoxifen, and after 2yrs had the surgery and switched over to aromasin, after having some issues with side effects, I then switched to arimidex which, for me, doesnt seem as bad. My sister in law, who takes femara has been on it for 7yrs and is still continuing...my onc told me that I will have a total of 5yrs hormonal therapy(I have one year to go) and unless further studies indicate benefits of continuing..he will take me off after the full total 5yrs. Beepie, I know its all confusing..but your doing a great job!! You are taking charge, investigating and learning so you can make the best decision for you.. and you are arming yourself with info that will help you! Anything at all that you want to ask is fine...there really arent any limits..I came here and continue to come so that I can offer help from my experiences..I didnt seek out that kind of help,but recently, Ive found many sites on the internet, for getting good info, kindness and places where I can express my feelings and concerns, and other women would know exactly how I felt..and that is an awesome feeling!! I am only sorry that I didnt look around earlier on..like you from the beginning.. Thinking of you Beepie!! hugs, cj.",

Needless to say, I will never, ever go back to him again!! oh ps. the nodule is being watched..so far, everything is good. You just keep on asserting yourself..Its your body!! Your life!!

      "Content": "Hi Beepie, I understand your emotions, this is a very tough time..things will seem better for you once you start treatment, mostly because it makes us feel like we are doing something to rid our bodies of the beast! Beepie, I will share with you my thoughts on lump vs mast, but remember everyone is different, whats right for me may not be for you.. I felt that removing my breast would bring me closer to all removal of any possibilites of having any cancer left behind and maybe having to go back in again as they sometimes have to with a lumpectomy..I am aware that cancer may even return in the area where the breast has been removed, but for me that chance seemed less likely to occur. There are things you need to be concerned about with having a mast..like lymphedema, I had 33 nodes removed (my surgeon did not give me the option of having the SNB, you can check that out on the internet) so I have a high risk of developing that now or anytime in the future, there are precautions...and I am careful. My hubby and parents were in favor of me having the mast., they felt more secure in feeling that the cancer would be removed that way..we were all in agreement. I have children, and would do anything I had to do in order to be here for them. I did not want to have rads, I have read about radiation recall, and women who had alot of skin, and organ problems after. In my mind, if the cancer had returned I think I would regret not having a mast...this weighed very heavy on my mind. My cancer was only very slightly estrogen postive, and progesterone neg..this means that hormone treatment like tamoxifen, and the aromatose inhibitors have less of a chance of keeping the cancer from returning.I had One postive lymph node, which can indicate that the cancer spread, or was on the move, and that knowlege (along with other information from the path report) will help to determine the course of treatment. It must be a very difficult decision for you, whether to tell your parents or not..I can understand how sensitive an issue this is..Im not sure what I would do in your postion.. I delayed my last mammo too, and have kicked myself many a time, but we have to let that go..you have so much right now to deal with..who knows maybe if we had gone when we should have there wouldnt have been any cancer visable, and waiting another year from then would have given the cancer all that time to grow..well never know, we have to be really gently on ourselves especially when there are so many issues to deal with. But Beepie, there are so many emotions with this disease..I buried my head in the sand for a very long time..but somewhere down the line, Ive realized that I hoped I could survive, I can be a survivor, and I will be a survivor!, each time I was knocked down..yeah I cried, had bad days, was scared, but I managed to pick myself back up and get back into my life again!! the other option wasnt very appealing to me! Beepie, I pray for you, for all others battling cancer..I hate this disease! but believe that there is hope, and that you will survive!! One step at a time! sending prayers and hugs your way, cj.

Hoppy, you should ask your dr. for an MRI they seem to work better on dense breasts. Do you have a strong history of breast cancer in your family? So I think that even though it causes alot of stress..you still have to do it..you owe it to yourself. I too got called back for a few years, but I was also told that the rad tech was also very picky about what he saw on the films that he would call back for every little thing..heck, I would rather that then have it be missed! Hope things go smoother for you both..and I hope that the fear and anxiety doesnt stop you from performing self breast exams, and having routine mammos.. best wishes, cj.",

I cant understand, why they seem to bother me so much..For me the aromasins side effects were worse,so far anyway, than arimidex. From what I understand aromasin is the only one that acts steroidal..look it up, I think that may be why my body couldnt tolerate it. I wont even bother to try the femara..I think I would probably have the same results..I believe that the pain is accumulative..for me seems to get worse the longer I am on it..at first I thought that the arimidex would be side effect free for me...until after a few weeks, then I noticed slowly the pains starting to come back. I have forgotten if I asked you this already but, do you exercise at all? I think that because I do, it is the only reason that I can still function at all..as it is now if I sit too long I get so stiff...somedays I feel like I am a very old lady!! I too am very envious of those who dont have to deal with this pain...my legs, my feet, somewhat low back, and terrible pain in the wrists..very stiff fingers..thats me!! hope to hear more from you...comparing notes!!

I can only offer you opinions from my own experience..I had a mast. with no reconstruction..my personal opinion was that I felt my body should heal itself first..I waited 2yrs, and then I decided to go for the reconstruction. I was having a difficult time with my own body image..my wonderful husband was not. I didnt even want to look at myself in the mirror. I decided on what I believed to be the safest way to get back what I had lost to cancer..and that was to have a saline implant..It was not without pain...however with meds it was okay. I have never regretted that decision. It is not my old breast..It does not have feeling, but it is a breast! I had a lift and reduction on the other side to make them look symmetrical..and they do..I went down to a C cup.. Kathy, this is such a personal decision..if you choose not to do it now, you can do it later..its only that you will then have to have an additional surgery. Please keep in touch, I have received so much support from others when I have gone through this..I only hope that I can \"pay it forward\"! hugs.. cj",

Muga scans are usually done before chemo and after chemo to check on the heart (or at other times if a problem arises). If her muga scan fell under a certain range they may feel that the chemo could be causing the weakness..and change the meds..sometimes another drug, even though it does the same to fight against the cancer..is better tolerated by the heart..We are in a very different world today..we have so many more drugs to fight this disease..and other meds to help with the side effects.. I can truly understand how worried you must be..try to stay strong for her..I am sure having your love and concern means the workd to her. hugs to you cj.",

I also had chemo..and just to let you know, its much easier than it used to be, I wasnt sick at all..and many women have that same experience..There are many different drugs that they will give you for any nausea that you experience..I did get very tired, and also had mouth sores, but they gave me some meds for the sores and they felt better. Im sure someone else will see your post and respond to you about the lump. This is a really great board, with many lovely ladies,who are here to lend support any way they can.

I definately have muscular problems..yes in my hip also..(but also just dx with fibro, which I question)alot of spasms in my calves, which I believe have added to a dx of plantar fasciitis..because the muscles have been tightening all over my legs.PT. is helping but the pain is not gone..but better. Yes, arimidex, according to the manufacturer can increase risk of osteo in patients who already have it..i think that is what has happened to my knees! That was very interesting info on the lung nodule..I just looked it up on the internet..funny but I was in New Mexico and Arizona..just twice in my life, but it was during the summer season..thankx for mentioning that..I will bring that up to my dr. and ask for a test..they can do a sputum or blood test. I am also an ex-smoker which is a consideration..Both of my drs. poo-pooed my concern..they tell me many people have them...I dont know, I worried alot when it was first found, but havent really given it a second thought lately..but I will make sure that they investigate it further, its very tiny right now. Why are you having your other breast removed? Is it the fear of recurrance? I often think about that myself..kinda think I should have done that at the same time..and not have to go through that whole thing again..but cant turn back time..just deal with what today has to offer. It is wonderful to have other women to swap stories with..Its like a sisterhood, part of a group..one that we never wanted to join!! but because we have, we can offer alot of support and encouragement to others. Teresa..Ditto..the arthritic pain..but I am 47, and dont believe I should be having it this bad..I have been active most of my life..I exercise and used to even run..Ive replaced that with long walks now..lol..yes, I believe that you have to finish your full course of treatment regardless of whether you have the breast or not. Breast cancer can even grow where there is no breast..on the chest wall..however I do not believe that it is very common. cj.",

Tell me more about the red yeast rice, just had my cholesterol taken and its too high for my liking..I want to add omega fish oil..just because its said that it is very healthy especially if you dont eat enough fish..I do eat fish alot but I still think it would help. COQ10 is good for the heart..and I just found out that I have leaky valves..never had it before but wonder if it could be a side effect from chemo. Yea for the Gila monster spit!! Its amazing the things they can do today! T-I eat organic too! I do not eat red meat at all, and chicken only occasionally. We eat fruit, vegies, nuts, beans and grains..my son says that is why he will never ever invite a friend over for dinner!!!lol my sister inlaw buys into a farm share during the summer and get beautiful fruits and vegies..I dont do it because it is way too much food for us and would have to throw too much of it out. Can you tell me the name of the vitamin that has both in it..I would be very interested in that. My bad habit is coffee..I drink decaf only, with no sweetener, but I really dont think 3 cups a day is really too good for you..but I cant help it!! and I dont do or eat anything else bad so I give myself that one. Even with my pain..I exercise everyday..I have to for my body and mind! I take elavil for fibro but its also an anti-depressant, and it so makes me feel better. I really think that PT will help you..because you sound like youre experiencing some of the same pains I am..and it is helping. I really hope you can get to one! We just have to keep in touch so you can tell me when you go..and then one day youll say you feel better..that would be so good!! I have also been on the anti-inflammatories..my mom gave me a paper a while back on the possible side effects..and it scared the heck out of me..thats when I decided I needed to do something to take care of the problem without meds..and Pt. sounded like something I wanted to try..I am behind you 100% when you say that you are gonna change and get active again Yahoo!!

I recently asked a friend who had that done about sensation in her breast..she said there is none..same as well with an implant. The areola and nipple from both surgeries look about the same..I havent seen anyone with a nipple that projects much longer after the surgery..they dont seem to be able to do them so they last..The surgery, and recupperation time are much longer for that procedure as well. Also ask to see some of the pictures from your plastic surgeon of all the different types of reconstruction..and if possible for the phone number of one of the patients that you can contact and speak to. Linda your vacation sounds awesome.. have you ever attended a relay for life? You will be amazed at the outpouring of support and love you will receive.

I am on elavil..my rheumatologis thinks that I have fibro...dont know if I agree but..she had me try the elavil at a very small dose (also anti-depressant)..and it seems to be helping with alot of my symptoms..sweats..anxiety..sleeplessness ..so I am going to stay on it as long as I have to take the A.I. JOJO..my advice, just take whatever makes you feel better and helps you to rest..your body will need to be rested and calm for your treatments..I personally didnt have any problem getting off them..I did not take them everyday..but did as needed..

Youll never believe this but...I did walk when I took ambien..walked into the kitchen looking for food...it was really funny..i remember I would eat banannas..I dont think I knew it while I was doing it, but I would remember when I woke up in the morning.

The fatigue can really wear ya down..I hope something works of for you..and soon. JOJO- the most healthiest nuts are walnuts and dry roasted almonds..but beware..they are very fattening..so only have about 10 a day. And yes..salmon is good..just make sure that you get the wild kind.. I do use flax..I buy it already ground with dried blueberries..but I understand that you should buy the seeds and grind them yourself...supposed to be healthier that way...No soy!, and no one told me that either..I had to find out that on my own..I have learned alot on my own..I want to eat healthy and I have to find out the right things to eat..so I do alot of research! So glad the melatonin worked for you..Your right just a little bit will help..I have also read that they believe melatonin may help fight bc..so I know some women take it strictly for that reason..I have taken up to 9mg.one night..really bad night..but I usually take 3mg. remember to shut off the lights!! I think I may need to take one myself tonight!! Just took a pain killer..waiting for it to start working.. cj.",

Let's see I was diagnosed 4yrs ago in january and have had 2 full body bone scans. I have no idea what protocol is on that one. I dont even know if they would have sent me for this past one, 2 months ago, but I was really complaining about all the pain, bone and muscle, that I was feeling..but luckily it was all clear..just the arthritis stuff..i have had 2 scares, a spot on my liver that seems to come and go..I have no idea, what thats all about..I guess different techs see different stuff..but the last had nothing! they also said that I have a lung nodule..that really sent me over the edge when they first told me..its small, so there isnt anything that they will do about it now..just wait and check on it in about 6months.. Have you ever had the full body bone scan? You should ask about it if you havent had one yet..I cant remember if you said whether you had any positive nodes? I did, that could be the reason for the bone scans..looking for mets. there. Did you get diagnosed with fibro after the cancer!! Its amazing to me how many women out there seem to be afflicted with all the same issues! Its always nice to talk to someone in the same boat!!

You dont get normal sensation either way..so you learn to live with it..You sound like me with not wanting to take pills..I was on ambien for a while..man was it ever difficult to get off them! Can I suggest something to you that came from my onc..check out melatonin..do a search, read what you can..it is what the body makes normally..adding a few mg. helps you to doze off.. I take up to 3mg. You need to be in a very dark room in order for it to work..and no tv...ready to fall asleep..youll feel it working in about 30 minutes..in the morning, open the shades and let in the sunshine, to help you to wake without the groggyness. Yes, it seems that many of us bc survivors have a difficult time with insomnia..it is probably a side effect of our meds. PT will help you so much..I wish someone had suggested it to me after my mast. I think youll be happy your going..youll see improvement probably after the first visit. Hi Teresa!

      "Content": "Dear Bellamay..you sure have my prayers..what an awful thing to have happened to you! I have implants as well, but chose saline because I feared something like this would happen to me...Ive always been the one who has had things go wrong...things that happen one in a million! You have really been through so much..between the dx, treatment and illnesses you have. There have been things which I have done..decisions I have made, without fully understanding the potential pitfalls...I ask more questions now..and re-ask if I dont understand..I always bring someone with me to my appt.s, cant seem to grasp all of what is being said (chemo brain?)...and I always ask for test results in writing. But as you know, everything happens so fast..its really difficult. I hope that you can find someone to help you with your current health problems. Thanks for taking the time to tell your story..I think when other women..or men for that matter, read this..it will make us stop and think about making sure we educate ourselves about what is happening with our bodies..so thanks for that.. Im praying for you, and wishing you well gentle hugs to you, cj.",

      "Content": "Oh Linda..I am so sorry to hear about the back problems..Oh try not to let it get you down..its easier said than done..But you sound like such a nice lady, youve got so much to offer people! My motto is..if you cant fix it, find the best way to live with it! What can you do to make some changes to feel better..did they give you any suggestions? Here I go again..but did you try PT for it? sorry if youve already mentioned that..I have such an awful memory! How about maybe water aerobics? I go every now and then to night classes at the YMCA, but when its too cold outside my muscles tense up bad so I will only go on warm days..but maybe you could look into doing that..it really doesnt put much stress on the body. I will say a prayer for you..that the cortisone shot helps your hip and legs! I did get some relief for my knees. you have a great weekend too...we are back to having alot of rain again!! cant wait for loads of sunshine.. sorry your feeling down..wish I could send you some happy face balloons to cheer you up..okay so just pretend I did!! cj.",
