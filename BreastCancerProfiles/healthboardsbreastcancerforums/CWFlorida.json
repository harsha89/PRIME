    "Content": "Hi PaulCindy - I'm not a doctor, but I had breast cancer at 37 (I'm now 39). Some of the things you can look for in your breast: stand in front of the mirror and loook at your breast - then raise your arms. Does the skin dimple like an orange? Or become indented? When I used gentle pressure, my cancerous lump felt somewhat hard, like a peach pit. I hope you can get the money together to at least see a general practitioner or nurse - they are used to giving breast exams and know what to look for. Go to the fancy bookstore, get Breast Cancer for Dummies off the shelf, and sit in the store's chair and read it. Lots of good information as to whether a lump is cancerous or not. U]Most are not[/U]. Good luck to you - wish I could help more! cw",
