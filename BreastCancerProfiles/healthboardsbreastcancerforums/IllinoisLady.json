    "Content": "Hi, I just thought I would tell you that for many,many years I had breast cysts and after a while it became the standard ( for me ) to expect to have an untrasound study done immediately after the radiologist read my mammo's. I use to worry every time and feel DREAD all the while I was doing the ultrasounds. As mentioned, time or time of month can often bring changes. As long as you keep up regular mammograms your doing what you can pretty much to insure your health. Hope all goes well for you. IllinoisLady",
