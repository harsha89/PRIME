    "Content": "Hi everyone. I had my cryo done 3 weeks ago and my period started last week. The cryo discharge was over & then my period came only a day later than normal. Last night I started having a bit of burning & soreness, the typical vaginal infection type symptoms. I'm wondering if anyone else has developed an infection not long after cryo and whether a full antibiotic was needed to kick it. My gyn/onc isn't in until later early evening and I know I'll be sent for lab work before anything is ordered anyway. Just curious. Thanks in advance!",
