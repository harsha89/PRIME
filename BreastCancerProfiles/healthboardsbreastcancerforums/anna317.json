      "Content": "It is true about laying on the stomach with your breasts in the holes. You do go feet first and machine is semi-open. But since you are laying face down anyway, you really don't see what is around you. I was very tense in the beginning, because I was afraid of the dye reaction. But I think the main thing is to relax. It is not a very pleasant procedure, but it is not too bad either. Tell your freand not to worry about it.",

      "Content": "\"Needtoescape\": I have an excisional biopsy tommorow. Needless to say I am very nervious! Can you fill me in a little on what to expect during the procedure and after?! My doctor could not do the needle one because my lump is moving a lot. I found it two months ago, my doctor strongly believes it is benign, but wants to remove it just to be safe. It did not show on mammo or ultrasound, only MRI showed some abnormality in the area, but it did not seem to concern my doctor much (and he is a very good one, very causious). So I really need some encouragement for tommorow!",

      "Content": "Just wanted to share with you good news and encourage those who are still in suspence! Last week I had excisional bipsy of my left breast (the MRI showed \"the area of concern\" of about 0.9 cm, neither mammogram nor ultrasound could see my lump, which was very pulpitable). The biopsy itself was far less scary than what I was imagining myself, I did not need even Tylanol after the first night. So, don't be scared! I was going nuts for the last almost three months over this lump, time to time almost convinced I had cancer! The biggest lesson I learned: don't worry about something to happen untill it really happened! Easier said than done (you have a queen of anxiety here!). But I think you learn that, you just don't have enough energy any more to worry about everything life brings your way untill you sure it is something worth worring about. I feel that way now at least. Good luck to all of you!",
