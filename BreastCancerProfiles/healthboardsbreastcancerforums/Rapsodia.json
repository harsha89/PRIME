      "Content": "Hello thanks for getting back to me. I had the biopsy on Friday afternoon -15th- an ultrasound guide core needle biopsy, local numbing, got to watch on the monitor as the radiologist inserted needle and removed tissue samples. I didn't know about the titanium clip until he finished getting samples and told me he was inserting the clip to 'mark' the mass to alert on future mammograms that yes, this had been biopsied; also, to find it again if they need to go back. I've been telling friends that I now have a bionic breast. Still awaiting results. After the biopsy was finished, the radiologist made some remark about getting the results to \"confirm\" that it's a fibroadenoma. And yes, all the reading I've done drove me crazy because mine has well-circumscribed margins (very rare in a malignant mass) but is taller than wide (very rare in a benign mass) so I assume one will cancel the other out, hoping it will be the former. And I know about 80% of biopsies being benign, but then how does that explain the women who are diagnosed? Some end up in the 20% group-- and you start to feel guilty that you're hoping it's someone else and not you. I will probably call the imaging center later today- dogs woke me to go out and here I am online- to see if a result is in. I'm hoping I don't have to wait for the public health doctor's phone call on Friday as the waiting is driving me crazy. But right now I am dealing with the pain and heartache of ending a relationship of nearly 3 years with my guy, who went with me to the biopsy (they told me I needed to have someone drive me home; I still don't understand why). Then the next afternoon when I asked about our plans for the evening, he informed me that he was attending a performing arts event directed by his former lover (with whom I've been repeatedly told for over 2 years now is a \"friend\"- who he offers to pick things up for whenever he's going out of town etc. and doesn't really 'see' but I know from mutual friends he is frequently in touch with and offering various kinds of assistance). He had not asked if I wanted to attend- probably because I stopped attending these shows a long time ago- but bought one ticket last week, then waited until 3 hrs before the event to inform me he was going, leaving me with no plans- and a very sore right breast- for Saturday night. Then I realized why he'd acted a bit surprised when I had told him the biopsy was scheduled for Friday- opening night of the show- and he said, \"No, that's fine\" and agreed to go, but obviously went out promptly and bought ONE ticket for Saturday night-- and never told me. This is the same man who took care of me for two weeks following a hysterectomy last year and who has been very helpful and supportive, even financially, when needed. I've just looked the other way about this \"friend\" (who never called, visited, or sent a card when I was in the hospital and never gets invited to any gatherings to which he invites other friends) and finally had enough. The day after a biopsy for cancer, for God's sake, and he chose to support her event rather than take me to dinner or relax with me at home. I guess, in his mind, he gave me one night; Saturday night was her night. But I have no right to complain, because these shows are only a few times a year-- and he makes plans with me all the other nights. Sorry this is so long, but now I feel like news of cancer would be nothing. At least cancer can be cut out. My heart is completely broken; I feel empty and rejected that he's, really, choosing his \"friendship\" with her over his relationship with me. I didn't buy his argument that I was trying to control who he could be friends with and that he didn't want to lose friends. All my friends are telling me I deserve better. But it hurts just the same. He's asked if my results have come back, and I told him that my results are none of his concern.",

      "Content": "Hi Linda, thanks for your post. I am sorry you are having to go through all of this, too. I am not sure I'm the one to be giving advice, but I think at least for peace of mind I would have the biopsy. Any time they see a mass the only way they can only confirm it, according to my understanding, is through a biopsy. To answer your questions: this is a first for me. I am 47 and had not had a mammogram in 3 years. (I go through a free cancer screening for uninsured). A week after the mammo, the doc called and said they need to do a followup just on the right breast. He assured me that this isn't uncommon; then I talked to several women who said they've been called back several times. Two weeks later, I went for the 2nd mammo and the tech said not to get dressed until the radiologist saw it and made a decision. Then another tech came in and said she was doing an ultrasound. Immediately after the ultrasound, the radiologist came in and showed me two solid masses. One he said was definitely a fibroadenoma; the other is likely a fibroadenoma but he said appears 'atypical' and he can't confirm this without a biopsy. I picked up the radiology report the next week and read the conclusion: \"suspicous, Correspond to BIRADS 4.\" This is vague to me, as I've heard that this could mean 23-34% probability of cancer; other places I've read the '4' category ranges from 2-95% (I didn't get a subcategory of A,B, or C). And I know that 80% of biopsies are benign. But now I worry because this mass is described as \"atypical fibroadenoma appearing solid mass\"- \"atypical\" because it is \"taller than wide.\" I need to stop reading! I've seen reports that masses that are taller than wide tend to be malignant. (I know there are other aspects, too- mine is well circumscribed, not irregular.) It's just impossible to take this casually (the doctor and radiologist seem to be, although the radiologist admitted that if this was his mother's US finding, he would recommend a biopsy. That tells me he is moderately concerned). I would almost rather they say \"it's 50/50; it could go either way\" or \"it does look worrisome\" as I would rather go in thinking omg it could be cancer and be surprised to hear it's benign rather than going in confident it's a benign tumor than be unpleasantly surprised to find out it's malignant. And I hate waiting! I will be back to report my results- and to give you support and keep up with your reports, too.",

      "Content": "Linda, Quick update sorry to leave you hanging. I got my result Friday morning- BENIGN. I'm hoping yours will be, too. Can't remember, what did they think yours was from the ultrasound? Mine did turn out to be a fibroadenoma, so I have two. I've had mammograms for years now but this is the first I've had FA, and I'm 47 now. I had read that if you're over 40 they usually want to remove fibroadenomas- that it's possible they can prevent a radiologist from seeing what could be underneath on future mammograms. The doctor that ordered my tests told me no, they can see \"around them.\" Huh??? Mine was not very big, I think just over 1 cm. The biopsy wasn't bad. I did ice myself 30 minutes on, 30 off, for 6 hours as instructed. I didn't have swelling- just a very small nick where the incision was, and probably a bit of bruising though not visual. But it's been over a week and my breast is stil slightly sore. I've been running and walking, though, so no biggie. Everyone says the same about this guy- but it still hurts, no matter how you slice it. And to complicate matters we live very close by each other and I'm not able to sell or rent my house and move, but I honestly wish I could. How do we send private messages or emails to each other from here?",

      "Content": "Well, I finally got scheduled for an ultrasound-guided needle biopsy-- will have at the end of the week. totally nervous and won't rest until I hear \"benign.\" The radiologist told me he's pretty sure it's just a fibroadenoma (he saw 2 masses on the US, said one is definitely FA) but the only way to be certain is to do a biopsy. Radiology report said \"corresponds to BIRADS 4\" (somehow, as confident as he was that it's FA I thought I'd get a '3'). It's immediately adjacent to the other FA but says \"somewhat atypical\" because it \"appears taller than wide.\" Guess it's normal to be nervous. Hate to have to wait over a weekend for results, but probably won't know anything until mid next week.",

      "Content": "I'm replying to my own post rather than start a new thread. If I get no response, I will go to another site. I had a 2nd mammo and then ultrasound. The radiologist talked to me immediately after, saying there were two masses- very likely fibroadenomas. Actually, he's 100% sure one is a fibroadenoma and fairly certain the other is as well- but the only way to know for sure is to do an ultrasound-guided biopsy. So, now I'm waiting for the procedure to be scheduled- and hoping I'll be in the 80% group-- meaning among those women whose biopsies turn out to show that there is no cancer. If anyone has had biopsy of fibroadenoma and can tell me more, I'd appreciate it. I thought fibroadenomas occurred only in women under age 40.",

      "Content": "I had a routine mammogram done and for the first time it came back \"abnormal screening.\" I'm in my late 40s with no family history of BC. The radiologist's report recommends additional screening because of \"asymmetry\" and I have to admit I don't know what that means. I'm having another compression and an ultrasound of the right breast. I actually feel a small, hard lump there. My sister said she had the same thing and her report came back stating dense tissue. I have to wait a couple of weeks. I'm sure it's nothing but am still nervous. I'd appreciate if anyone can explain \"asymmetry\" and help reassure me.",

I am sure it'll turn out to be nothing; the radiologist seemed to think one was \"atypical\" and is just doing a biopsy to be certain. I'm also wondering, as I've read on several sites that if you're over 40, they recommend removing a fibroadenoma. This hasn't been explained to me, just that they will remove some tissue and send it to pathology.",

This year was the first time, however, I had a screening mammogram come back with \"abnormal\" results. I hadn't had a mammo since 2006, so I guess it is possible I had a fibroadenoma developing as far back as 2 years ago.",

Wow, I read an article about how some insurance companies are acting like biopsies for suspected fibroadenomas are unnecessary and cause anxiety in women. But, I think it's 20% of biopsies that turn out to reveal cancer-- so I would think these women are glad it was caught and could be treated. On the other hand, not having the biopsy and waiting 6 mos. for an ultrasound, to me, would be more stressful. Insurance is not an issue, as this is being done through a cancer screening program for uninsured women.",
