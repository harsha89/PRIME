I know the last lump I found was due to the fertility drugs I was on at the time. It too could be a swollen gland, but I am not sick at this time. Thanks for your response and I will let you know how it goes Amy",

      "Content": "Thanks for your response. I am probably over-reacting. I am a bit cancer-phobic (but then again who isn't) My grandfather died from cancer and my father has cancer now and just had major surgery to remove it. But I will follow up on it. I will check it again after my period and see if it is still there. If it is, I will go to my doctor. I know early detection is the best. Amy",

      "Content": "Tonight, while showering, I was washing my armpit and felt a lump in my breast, on the side near the arm pit area. I felt on the other breast to see if I had one over there, but no. It is tender and sore. I had my husband feel it and he said it felt like muscle. I am near my period and usually get a little tenderness. I am wondering if I should wait until after my period and the tenderness goes away to feel for it again. I am 40 years old and feel totally ignorant asking these questions. I had a mamogram several years ago for a lump. I was on a lot of fertility drugs at the time and the mamogram showed nothing, nor did a ultrasound of the area. They attributed the lump to the fertility drugs. Any advice? Thanks Amy",
