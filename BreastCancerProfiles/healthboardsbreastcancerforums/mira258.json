      "Content": "My sister had Stage 1 and Stage 0 BC. no lymph involvement. She is 42. She opted for a double mastectomy. Oncologist said to do chemo (4 rounds) and tamoxifen. She just wants to do tamoxifen. Her tumor was estrogen pos, but negative for something else (they said that was good). She goes for her PET scan Tuesday. I am sick with worry. Did anyone have the same and opt for just the tamoxifen? She seems to think the chemo only helps her chances of it not returning by 5% (based on some studies she found). Thank you for your responses and hope you are well.",
