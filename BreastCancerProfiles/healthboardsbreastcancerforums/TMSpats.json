      "Content": "I have to agree with everyone....I would have it checked anyway. I have my mammos every year as required and somehow in between I got breast cancer. So...they had plenty to compare it with ..my husband still doesn't understand how I could go from having everything OK to having breast cancer...Screening mammo is what you need and I would get another opinion or two from other offices. From what I understand and have read and have learned through this experience is that cancer of the breast takes about 10 years to appear...no more waiting around for me...I have been doing the waiting game for months and it's awful waiting for results or time to pass when you are dealing with your life. Mine were microcalcifications which turned out to be cancer and from what I understand they usually do. Anyway...I say go get tested, biopsied would be the best and don't wait. I would hate to wait 6 months and end up with stage IV breast cancer or somthing like that....Sorry for being so blunt, but I am still being treated for it, so I am speaking from very recent experience.",

      "Content": "What do you want to know. I had it done when I had a lumpectomy in January. The purpose was to check and see if the cancer got to my lymph nodes. I definitely wanted to know that. If it had, which it didn't, I would want to start treatment right away before it got worse. Really, that was the most painful part of the procedure as far as recovering is concerned. In other words, my arm hurt more that my breast did. It has healed up quite nicely though and the pain has gone away. I have to be careful with that arm because every now and then I get this shooting pain if I try to reach too far, but even that has gotten better. I can't complain, it was worth the peace of mind for me. As far as how reliable is it, I guess time will really tell. Hope I answered some questions...just let me know what else you might want to know.",
