      "Content": "lionelsgranny, So sorry to hear you're going through this very stressful time. I went through a similar journey a couple years ago with an abnormal mammo, a stereotactical biopsy, then an excisional biopsy (surgery). My results came back benign with a precancer, but no cancer. This is a time that will play with your emotions and mental health like you've never been through before. However, if you let your thoughts turn toward the worst-case scenario, you will undergo a lot of unneeded worry and anxiety. It's important that you go through all of the testing and surgeries they recommend, and realize that chances are high that the results will be benign. If it does turn out to be cancer, rest in the realization that you've been getting regular testing so if there is a cancer it would likely be very early stage and highly treatable. Breast cancer isn't a death sentence in most cases, especially when women get their routine screening exams on a regular basis. Many breast cancer centers have very compassionate nurses on staff who are able to talk to patients and explain things in layman's terms. I'm not sure if you went to a breast cancer center that would offer this, but you may want to call and ask if they would have such a person you could talk to. Hugs to you, and best wishes for some benign results!",

      "Content": "Hello azlisa60, I hope you've already had you're excisional biopsy and that the results came back non-cancerous. I got called a couple of years ago to have a biopsy after a mammogram showed some clustered calcifications. The stereotactic biopsy showed atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH) in 2 lesions. I then had to visit a surgeon for an excisional biopsy of the 2 lesions as sometimes early cancers can be mixed in with ADH, and excision of the lesions and doing pathology is the only way to find out. In my case, more ADH was found but no cancer. It was explained to me that ADH is one step below cancer - cells will go through multiple changes on their way to becoming cancer, you don't just one day have healthy cells that turn into cancer, they have a range of changes they go through first. I was told that normally women have a 1 in 8 to 1 in 9 chance of getting breast cancer during their lifetimes. When you have ADH, you then have about a 1 in 4 chance, so roughly double the chance of getting breast cancer compared to other women. In your case, the most concerning part of what you have described is, \"There is a small focus of atypical ductual hyperplasia present.\" This basically means you have a very tiny area of ADH which again are the cells just a step below cancer. Most of the other things said in your report describe changes that are found in cells going from normal cells to becoming more abnormal (but not yet cancerous), and many women (if not most as we age) have these changes. For whatever reason, many women have ADH and never go on to develop cancer, so don't think of it as a situation where you will someday get cancer. However, you'll need to make sure you get your mammograms when scheduled in the future. Best wishes!",

      "Content": "Good news so far on the benign report. However, the report shows a bulge from pectoralis in the deep central breast. Mammograms and sometimes ultrasounds don't get a good view of the breast tissue that lies directly on the chest wall right above your rib cage. MRI's can get this view, and that's why it has been mentioned. Something is causeing a bulge from the chest wall of your breast, and if it were me I would want to go ahead and get the MRI to make sure it's not a cancerous lump causing it. Suzanne Summers had BC in the chest wall - look up her story. She had just finished a mammo and not a clean report as the mammo couldn't see the chest wall area, and the doctor mentioned they had a great new technology (I think it was a type of new ultrasound). The doctor then performed that test just as a whim, and found the cancer she had. Chances are your lump is benign, but in the unlikely event it is cancer you want to catch it as early as possible.",

Usually the only time someone your age gets breast cancer is if they have a genetic defect for breast cancer, such as BRCA1 or BRCA2. Angelina Jolie has BRCA1, and that's why she recently had a prophalatic bilateral mastectomy. Short of that, it's most likely a cysts as your doctor said. You often can't feel cysts. This is really nothing to be frightened by, but it is important to be diligent about getting this checked out fully.",

You are very fortunate that there was no lymph node involvement, so there's a big reason to celebrate! A place you might want to turn to to get additional input on your question would be a local breast cancer support group. Almost all communities have them and they meet on a regular basis. Best wishes on your decisions and on going through chemo. I have a friend who had Stage II BC with sentinal node involvement, and she went through chemo and said it wasn't bad at all.

      "Content": "royaloakmom, I'm so sorry you're going through this, and I've experienced some of what you're going through as I have ADH and had to have an excisional biopsy, but thankfully it came back just as more ADH and no cancer. A few things for you to know. Most people who get breast cancer have no family history, and about 1 in every 8 or 1 in every 9 women will get breast cancer. Also, if caught early it is very treatable, so in no way is getting breast cancer today a death sentence. Cells will go through a range of changes before they become cancerous; they aren't just normal cells one day and cancerous the next. You can think of it as a range of abnormal changes they go through on their way to becoming cancer. Many of the things talked about in your report are findings that are consistent with cells becoming abnormal but not yet cancer. There are two important parts of your report: 1. \"Diagnosis of focal atypical ductal hyperplasia\" - this means that you have tiny (focal) spots of ADH which is a step below cells becoming cancer. When this is found on a biopsy, they typically will have a surgeon remove the lesion (excisional biopsy) as sometimes early cancers are mixed in with ADH. 2. \"This is considered a high risk lesion.\" - this means the radiologist who read your imaging has a high level of suspicion that there may be cancer based on how the imaging looks. I don't want to concern you by this as there is still a good chance you don't have cancer, and if you do there is a very good chance it's an early cancer and therefore very treatable. You will likely be having an excisional biopsy very soon and possibly other tests, and it will take a few days after your surgery to get your pathology results. Trust me that the days waiting for the pathology results are very stressful, but try to plan normal or fun activities to keep your mind off it. We're here for you, and we would love to have you keep us updated on how everything progresses for you! Big hugs to you!",

If you're someone who tends to become fixated on the worst scenarios, then it may be best to avoid reading any medical type of literature and instead focus on support groups to talk to others and be able to vent your feelings. There are a lot of women who have dense breasts and all that really means is that they can't get a good picture by mammogram so they then need to go to ultrasound or MRI to get clear pictures of what is going on in your breasts. Many women get sharp pains or strange feelings like milk letting down, but very rarely does this mean you have cancer. You don't have any lumps and so far no findings that would indicate anything that looks like cancer, so it's highly unlikely that you have anything like cancer at this time. Again, it's very common for women to have dense breasts, and having dense breasts doesn't mean cancer. I hope you get your sonogram results soon and that you find out everything is just fine. Feel free to vent on here anytime, and please let us know how everything goes!",

They gave me a small, perhaps 4\" somewhat triangle shaped ice pack to put there to help with pain and help stop bleeding after the procedure. If you're having a stereotactic biopsy, I found my wounds were approximately 3/8\" in diameter, and they bled for about a week after the procedure. If I was up and around and active, they would bleed worse (I had two biopsies on the same breast at the same time). They told me to sleep in my bra for a week afterward to help with compression.",

I thought I was holding really still, but was told later that my images toward the end were blurry from me moving around a little bit.

Breast MRI's can also give some false positives.

My surgeon said I could pay for it myself if I wanted to, but I'm on disability and couldn't afford it.
