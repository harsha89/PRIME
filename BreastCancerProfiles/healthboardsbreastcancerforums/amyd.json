    "Content": "My sister first noticed a small lump in her left armpit. Said she felt fine, didn't hurt. It then grew to the size of a softball. Kaiser said that they couldn't see her for another two months. Longgggggg story short: She then found a lump in her left breast. Dr. said it was a fibroid -- it wasn't -- and did nothing. Months later same Dr. removed \"fibroid\" using very little local anesthesia while my sister was awake. Dr. then said she was wrong (while my sister is laying on operating table), that it was indeed cancer. Strange thing was she never felt sick or had any type of pain anywhere.",
