      "Content": "Hi, I am 40, my grandmother and greatgrandmother died of breast cancer. I have calcifications in my right side that we are \"watching.\" The mammo and ultrasound are negative. I have very dense breasts, and they can never see anything on the mammo, so I asked about MRIs. I was told that they have a lot of false positives that would probably lead to an unneeded biopsy and my insurance won't cover it b/c I am not \"high risk.\" I am having a lot of wierd problems in that breast like itching, extra lumpiness. Should I have it anyway? Technically, I can scrape out the $3,500 for the thing... it's certainly worth more than my life, but they are treating me like I'm a paranoid nut. Your thoughts would be appreciated.",
