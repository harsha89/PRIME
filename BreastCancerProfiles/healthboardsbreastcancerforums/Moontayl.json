    "Content": "I can somewhat relate. About 4 months ago I found a lump in my right breast-just of the side of my \"niple\" area. I thought nothing of it and figured it had to be due to my cycle. It didn't go away and about a month ago I went to see my doctor, who sent me to have an ultrasound and mammo. They were really mean to me there and I just had an aweful experienece. They felt the lump, but nothing showed up on the ultrasound. They never did the mammo and told me to come back when I was 40 (I'm 28) they were really short with me. They told me to \"ignore the lump\". I said, \"what about the mammo\", the doctor said again \"come back when you are 40\". I was so angry. My great grandmother (on my moms side) died at 32 of breast Cancer. I have already have cervical Cancer at 20 (formed from the HPV Virus). So, I know I am young, but there is family history there. I don't know what to do. Thre is no pain with my lump and it's about the size of a dime. Also, I have lumpy breasts (fibrosis), but if you have a \"true\" lump, you'll know it! So, do I just ingnore it as the doctor told me to or should I get another opinion?",
