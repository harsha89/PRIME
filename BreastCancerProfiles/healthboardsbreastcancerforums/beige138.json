    "Content": "I just wanted to point out quickly, as a reminder, that the increase may not be cancer. It may not be anything at all. Most women actually have one breast slightly larger than the other. The pregnancy, although brief, could have made it more obvious. If you took birth control pills, that could do it too. Also our breasts can actually continue to grow well into our 20s. I'm definitely not a doctor or anything, I just wanted to give you some other (not so scary) possibilities to think about. :-) I wish you the best!",
