      "Content": "I was a nationally ranked amateur athlete before my first diagnosis in 2007. It was stage 0 DCIS at that time and I went with mastectomy to get the cure. I received a prognosis of cured but I was one of the statistically insignificant few who have a recurrence of cancer shortly after being \"cured\". My second diagnosis in 2009 was advanced. I did chemo, surgery, radiation and a year of Herceptin. I started a five year regimen of Arimadex in February 2011. I found the joint pain to be crippling. I've switched to the more expensive femarra but see little to no improvement. So I too am considering whether to continue. I know this...cancer kills. I am inclined to keep on with the femarra. Here is the good news, I was told to expect weight gain with the arimadex/femarra. But I have lost 12 pounds. I found it was the Herceptin that kept the weight on me. It took about three months of being off of herceptin before my body started to respond to losing weight. Diet and exercise. Stimulate your metabolism, it is sluggish from the drugs. But don't give up. My advice is to keep on with the drug therapy unless you can not stand it. Put forth ****** effort into the diet and exercise. Do not expect your body to respond the way it did before the cancer therapies. It won't. But it will respond eventually.",

      "Content": "Have you had success with Lymphedem? I have! Here is my success story. I was in very good health before my first diagnosis of breast cancer in 2007. Before I was able to recover fully, I received a second diagnosis in 2009. Because of multiple surgeries, I suffer from widespread mild to moderate lymphedema of the arm, chest, back, and abdomin. A year of chemo put 30 pounds of fluff on my frame. I am currently taking femarra. Let me say that I took an early and agressive stance against lymphedema. I had little to no success the entire time I was on Herceptin. But three months after I was off hecreptin I began to see results with the lymphedema therapists attempts, my own self massage, compression garments and a compression machine. I was spending about three hours a day in therapies. As I began to feel better I began to exercise again. I dieted diligently and still do. I began to experiment with over the counter supplements. Here is what I found: Keeping your total body volume down helps tremendously and is the first step towards significant relief. As hard as it is, lose weight. Avoid sodium, drink plenty of fluids and do hours of low-impact exercise each week. Always wear compression garments during exercise and a few hours after. Remain relentless. I have achieved significant relief and I have maintained it. You might be able to as well. It is possible. But it takes Herculean effort. Ask your doctor if it is okay for you to try weightloss thermogenic products. I asked my doctor and he said I was healthy enough. Start at a low dose. I saw results in the first 12 hours. If you don't see result, stop taking it. My thinking was that my sluggish metabolism was chemically induced, so why not chemically stimulate it? I was trying to lose weight. But what I found was the lymphedema in my arm reduced by more than half. Then, later, the lymphedema in my torso and abdomin reduced. I kept the dosage low. Lower than the label suggested. Every few weeks, I go off the thermogenic for a few days. The lymphedema returns but goes away again after I start up again. Synephrine and Yohimbe works best. Take carefully, follow all precautions and keep your dosage low. I still must keep up with my compression garments and massages. I will never be free of that. But the difference is, now it works. My Lymphedema Therapist told me I don't need to go back unless it gets worse again! Weight lifting or resistance training aggravates my symptoms. Low-impact activities and range of motion excersices help keep me flexible even though the femarra makes my joints feel like those of an 85 year old woman. Exercise must be combined with compression and massage...but I have to do that anyway. Do you have a success story?",
