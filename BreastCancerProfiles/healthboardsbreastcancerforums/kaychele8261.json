    "Content": "the only thing i have to tell you is to go see your doc ASAP. my mother found a lump in her breast about 5yrs ago...she went to her doc and found out that she did have cancer...she did have to have her right breast removed but they did catch it in time b4 it spread. it is a scarey deal....but if you do catch it in time you have nothing at all to worry about. good luck to you.
