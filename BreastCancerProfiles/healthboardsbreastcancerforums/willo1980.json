      "Content": "Thanks guys. I just got back from the procedure, and in itself, it wasn't bad. I didn't feel any pain just uncomfortable tightness from the compression. Even the numbling shot wasn't bad. They were concerned because A) the spot had grown 2 mm since May, B) It was sitting directly on top of a blood vessel, and C) there is not a 3 mm spot deeper in the breast and on the same vessel that WASN'T there on my mammo from Nov. 5!! They took out the 5 mm one. I couldn't really see anything in the specimen cup but blood. I bled so bad that I am now wrapped in a bandage! There was blood everywhere! Hopefully, it comes back benign and I can move on with my life. I'm in pain now though, the tylenol isn't doing too much. I'm stinging A LOT!",

It's red around the incision area but I can't tell if that's from tape irritation or what. I'm gonna take my tylenol like she told me to. And will call her back if it's not getting better.",

I should've taken it next at 5:30 this morning and I slept through it (actually I sort of woke up but was worried I wouldn't be able to get back to sleep if I woke up so I dozed on and off). Now I am in PAIN! I took my tylenol almost an hour ago and it's not doing much. I have pain from the side of my breast all the into my armpit. They told me a nurse would be calling me so thats good,.",

I see the surgeon on Wed. morning to discuss results. Should I insist on a biopsy even if the spot hasn't grown? The breast that the mass is in is somewhat tender lately and it hurts some in my armpit. I will surely mention this to the surgeon. I just don't get it. I've read that if there are no changes they usually take the mammo report to BI-RAD 2. I'm 27! Why would I need to keep checking it? Why can't they just take it out and see what is it for sure?!?!",

      "Content": "OK...um...I called the doctor's office yesterday and was reassured by the nurse who picked up the phone that I would only need to come back for a mammo in 6 months. Well, my doctor's nurse called me this afternoon and said \"you have a bi-rad three, the are is 5mm and dense, and it needs to be evaluated by a surgeon.\" The odd thing is, it's not in the breast I originally was having the mammo for! The spot I felt and my doctor felt was benign. But, apparently there is a 5mm. mass in my left breast that isn't causing me any pain and I can't feel yet, and the mass needs to be evaluated because they can't determine if it's benign or malignant. Just when I thought the sun was coming up, rain clouds moved in!",

      "Content": "Hello everyone, I'm 27 and had a mammo and u/s last Tuesday because of a lump in my right breast. Last night I got the radiologist's report via snail mail. It read: \"Your recent mammography examination showed an area that we believe is benign (not cancer). However, in six months, you should have a follow-up mammogram to confirm this area has not changed.\" I was just wondering if anyone had a \"benign area\" that later turned into cancer? And by area, what is he referring to? I've heard women say their reports said the lump is benign or a benign mass, but not an area! Should I call my doc and get more details? My maternal grandmother had breast cancer and so did my mom's aunt. I'm just concerned that an area may appear benign because of my age and my dense breats. I just don't want this \"area\" sitting around in my breast waiting to turn into cancer.",
