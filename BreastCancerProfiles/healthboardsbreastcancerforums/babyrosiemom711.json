      "Content": "Elle, the lumps are not cysts because they do not move. Lou, I don't know a whole lot about the disease yet, but I was explained the difference between fibroglandular & fibrocystic. Fibrocystic disease is a hardening of the breast tissues & the lumps move with the breast tissue. Fibroglandular disease affects the mammory glands, not the normal breast tissue, & the lumps are stationary & do not move. I do know that fibroglandular tissue is normal in the breast, but this disease attacks it & makes it swell & harden & typically causes pain only during hormone fluctuations, but for some reason mine is causing me constant pain which typically only happens as women with the disease get older & it progresses further. I have basically been told that Cysts, A Fatty Mass, A Benign Tumor & Fibrocystic Disease are all ruled out at this point because the lumps do not move. Basically, at this point the only options for diagnosis are Fibroglandular Disease or Cancer based on the fact that none of the masses move at all. I'm still waiting to hear about the MRI, & until then they are treating it as the fibroglandular. I just really need a treatement other than NSAID's, but cannot find any information to any other treatements avaiable.",

      "Content": "Well, first of all, I have fibroglandular disease, not fibrosystic disease. I was just diagnosed & I am only 23 years old. From what I understand, most women experience pain only when they have hormone fluxuation, but for the last 3 weeks, I've experienced constant pain. At least 2 lumps have greatly increased in size in just the last year. My doctor is oredering an MRI just to make sure that her diagnosis is correct, but she is pretty confident in it for now. The pain is overwhelming right now to the extent that I was given Ultram to cope with it for now. I'm wondering if there is anything else I can do so that I'm not popping pills constantly & so that I don't feel so hopeless that this is a life sentance of pain for me.",
