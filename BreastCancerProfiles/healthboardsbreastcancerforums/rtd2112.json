    "Content": "Hi All My mother is going through chemotherapy for Breast Cancer. First session, she did great. Barely any side effects at all, EXCEPT her white blood cell count got extremely low. So 2nd session goes fine, 4 days after it she decides to get this shot called neulasta which is supposed to replenish white blood cells rapidly. Anyway, 4 days after the shot she is experiencing severe muscle contractions/spasms, etc, and for the past 3 days all she has done is sleep. Anyway, the doctor said that how she responded after the FIRST treatment should be indicative of how she will respond the rest of the way. So I am confused by how badly she'sm doing after the 2nd session considering how well she did after the 1st. Expecially since these bad side effects didnt start until 10 days after the chemo. Anyway, I cant help but wonder if these side effects are from the Neulasta, NOT the chemo? Can anyone else that has had the shot talk about it's side effects? Should I be worried? I'm confused...",
