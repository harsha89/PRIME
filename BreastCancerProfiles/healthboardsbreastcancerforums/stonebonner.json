    "Content": "Maybe someone can explain, because I don't get it. Went in for a ultrasound last week and they called me this week and gave me the results. The nurse said it was fine and could not give much more info than that. She just said that the report stated findings were unremarkable. Thought she was about to tell me to check back in 6 months. Well, she instead tells me they would like to have me do a mammogram so that the results can be compared. If everything is fine on the ultrasound what needs to be compared? I have implants and thought that ultrasound was better than mammogram anyway if you have implants. Kinda confused. I can still feel two lumps in my right breast so something obviously is there and so is the pain.",
