      "Content": "Hi had the core biopsy today wasn't too bad didn't hurt either .. Like with the FNA I was given a local . They then use a needle guide its a needle that they thread the core biopsy needle through .. They use a ultrasound to line the guide needle up then place the core thingy through the guide while watching it under ultrasound to make sure its aimed at the lump then they fire off a needle like a tiny harpoon lol it grabs a tiny slither of cells and then they pull it out and put it on slides .. But it dosen't hurt at all as the local started to wear off it stung but still wasn't painful .. Hope this explains it a bit for you ? Di P",

I sort of thought they didnt when the Dr who did the FNA had finished said to me \"if we were unable to get any cells you will need to come back to have a core biopsy .. i see the specialist at the breast clinic tomorrow so I should hear more of what goes on from here",
