      "Content": "Reply to Sister: I totally agree with what you say. I have asked many surgeons about breast removal and they all say No. Also, note that in my experience, no body cares if we are scared. Not doctors (physical or mental) not breast cancer support groups and just forget about the staff at breast health centers. Every body just says don't worry. My fear is so great, I can't get myself to my next mammogram. How do you deal with your fear?",
