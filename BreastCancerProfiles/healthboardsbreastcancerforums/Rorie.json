      "Content": "Thanks so much for your replies. I wouldn't be so nervous about the mammogram except for the fact that last year I had lots of CT scans and x-rays to try to figure out the pain I was having in different parts of my body (which didn't end up showing anything), so I had lots of radiation exposure...I was just hoping an ultrasound might be the better way to go...but then again I hate to ask the doctor for one when he already ordered a mammogram. Thanks again!",

      "Content": "I would like your advice. My doctor wants me to have a mammogram because I am having pain in my right breast. I am 31 years old. I had just read an article about not having mammograms until you are 40 because of the risk of radiation. I wasn't brave enough to ask my doctor for an ultrasound instead. Now I've read conflicting articles about how mammograms are the best way because they are the most accurate, etc...others say mammograms are risky for younger patients. What do your doctors recommend? Thanks",
