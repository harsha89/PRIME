      "Content": "I recently had a mammogram because I felt a lump on my left nipple area, a few days later I was called and told to come in for a breast ultra sound on my right breast which I did not know or feel any lumps in this brease. Anyway, I went in for the ultra sound and was told by the radiologist that I have several suspious lumps, probably only cysts, but he could not tell, so is sending me to see a surgeon, for biopsy and that he did not see anything in my left breast which I can feel. My question is, is it possible for a cyst to turn into cancer and would you want them removed?",
