      "Content": "I was told I had calcifications 6 months ago and was told to have another mammogram in 6 months. I went in last week for that mammo. The radiologist was there at the hospital when I had the mammo, and he ordered more pictures, then ordered an ultrasound. Of course they would not tell me anything, and had me a bit frantic. My family doctor called this morning and said I had calcifications and what the radiologist thinks is a cyst. My dr said these results warrant an MRI, so he is setting that up for me, getting insurance pre-determination. I have been reading the posts here for the last 6 months, and find that calcifications are very common. I have 2 sisters who have had breast cancer, and both of them have a daughter who had breast cancer.",

      "Content": "This is going to be long, but please bear with me I just got the results of my yearly mammogram and I am more than a little concerned. The hospital radiologist sent me a letter saying that an area was seen that they believe is benign but reccomend that I have another mammogram in 6 months. My doctor's nurse called me and said that the mammogram showed some calcification and that I should have another mammogram in 6 months. If they are not sure if this is benign, I wonder if I should wait for a recheck in 6 months, or should I insist on finding out just what this is now? I have lumpy breasts, and it is difficult for me to know if there are changes. I have had several aspirations in the past and all have been ok. I know I have a small pea sized lump that has been there for a couple years and have pointed that out to the radiologist doing my mammograms and was told it was just a cyst. I really would like some feed back on this. I actually had one radiologist tell me that maybe I was doing too many self exams and that I should just relax... I have two sisters who had breast cancer, one a 15 year survivor and the other passed on. Officially my sister died of a heart attack, but it was most likely brought on by the cancer that she was being treated for. She had had a chemo treatment and was sent home eventhough she complained of not feeling well enough to go home. The nurse told her that the doctor had signed her release papers and she could not keep her in the hospital. That very night she woke her husband up to help her to the bath room and she died in his arms. I have a number of other health problems, high cholestrol, possible Crohns Disease, (I am scheduled for a colonoscopy in Aug.), restless leg syndrome, osteopenia, costachondritis, reflux, and suffer from migraines. I am 53, and work out at a fitness center for at least an hour 5 days a week. Every time I have to see a specialist, they take one look at my medication list and seem to think I cannot possibly need all those medicines. I have gotten so I tell them to tell me which ones I don't need..Every time they end up adding another pill to the list. I went to a headache clinic a couple years ago, and they took me off all medications, and they did their own tests including psychological screenings, and they ended up putting me back on all the medications and added 4 more. I really need advice as to whether I should insist on getting to the bottom of this now!! Thanks for listening.",

      "Content": "Nancy, thank you for responding to my post. What you say makes perfect sense. You are probably right that if the radiologist and doctor were not fairly confident that the area is benign, they would be advising a biopsy or ultrasound. They have ordered ultrasounds before for me. I have an appointment next week with my family docotr, and will discuss with him and then decide if I need to schedule another appt. with my GYN. Both doctors are very easy to talk to and listen to me well. I will keep you posted, and Thanks again. It does help to get an outside perspective. Kentuckywoman",

      "Content": "I saw my family doctor today and he said the report for my mammogram says that I have several small nodules scattered about but they feel confident they are benign. I have decided to just try to forget about it for 6 months and get rechecked then. I have too many other issues to deal with now anyway.",
