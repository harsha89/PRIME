    "Content": "I have completed 5 years on tamoxifen after bc, and did not have any side effects. Tamoxifen does not deplete the estrogen from the body, it blocks the estrogen from the breast cell receptors. Unlike tamoxifen, Femara ( the new drug recommended for the next 5 yrs) does diminish estrogen. It stops the conversion of the hormones in the adrenal glands, androgen, from turning into estrogen. I am debating whether to start on it . Is there anyone who has been on it yet. What have your experiences been so far?",
