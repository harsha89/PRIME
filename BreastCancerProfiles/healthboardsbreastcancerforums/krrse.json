    "Content": "Hi Everyone, I'm not sure if I have something to worry about or not. I have been experiencing a terrible itch on and off on my right nipple, there is also some flaking and a small lesion with dry patches around it. The flaky skin comes and goes as well. I went to see my doctor and she said I could have a yeast infection but I've never been pregnant so I'm not sure. From everything I've been reading on the internet, these are some of the same symptoms as Paget's disease which is pretty scary stuff, I've been worried since leaving my doctor's office and I will be getting a mammogram in the next couple of weeks. Do my symptoms sound serious or am I just doing too much research on the internet? Any help or suggestions would be appreicated. Thanks so much in advance.",
