      "Content": "Hello, I noticed that I did not answer any of your questions in my reply...sorry. Hair thinning - did not happen to me and I don't remember it being a common side effect. Nausea - did not happen to me and again, it is not a common side effect of radiation. The treatments themselves did not feel like anything at all - the \"zapping\" of radiation is where you see green lights around the room, they position you to the enth degree on the table and you're not allowed to move AT ALL once they position you - that's how precise the treatments are. The \"zapping\" takes just a few minutes - placing you on the table and positioning you takes longer than the procedure itself. I did not feel any burning sensation at all during the radiation treatment. And no, you will not feel sunburned during the radiation treatment. I, unfortunately do not have an answer for your question about doing worse than \"darker sisters\". Good luck again - Maureen",

      "Content": "I had 44 radiation treatments back Feb/Mar 2008. The treatments themselves were painless but because I had 12 lymph nodes removed, it became quite difficult to put my right arm above my head for the actual radiation treatment. My skin began to turn red in my right armpit area (I had a right breast mastectomy and 12 lymph nodes removed in my right armpit) about 2-3 weeks into treatment and about on week 4, the skin actually peeled as if I had been burned in a fire. I don't mean to scare you but that's exactly what it looked and felt like. My doctor told me to use a cream called Silver Sulfadiaziane (SSD) - so we would put the cream on (very delicately), tuck a wash cloth under my armpit (so it wouldn't get on my t-shirt) and then put on my shirt. My armpit \"burn\" started to subside shortly after the radiation treatments ended. Today - more than 16 months after treatment, I have no side effects or burn scars from radiation. Please do not hesitate if you should have any more questions or if any clarification is needed. Good luck and God Bless. Maureen.",
