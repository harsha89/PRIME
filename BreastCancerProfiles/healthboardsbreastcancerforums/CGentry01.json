    "Content": "I have been hurting in my upper back. This awful burning tingling aching feeling. I have also been just had an open biopsy on my breast and it was cancerous. They dont know if it has spread to other parts of my body yet. I am to go to an Oncologist the 4th of Feb., this is worrying me because I have had this pain for at least a year. Year before last I had a mammogram and it showed some abnormalties, but my surgion said to wait till the next year and have another mammogram to see if it has grown. I did not go back the next year and went in Nov of last year and it had grown into several areas. My surgeon said he took out quite a few but he wanted me to see an Oncologist to see what she suggested. This is very scary. Has anyone heard of such a thing being a symptom? HELP",
