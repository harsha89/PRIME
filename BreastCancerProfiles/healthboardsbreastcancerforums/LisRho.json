    "Content": "Hi My name is Lisa, I am 37. I had a yearly mammo earlier this year, as my yearly mammo's. It was clear. I have been having yearly mammo's since I was 28 because of an area my doctor felt, family history (both mom had premenopausal breast cancer and the fact that she was privatly adopted and we have NO other medical history than that) and the fact that I had a hysterectomy when I was 31 due to CIN3/CIS0 and scar tissue. Also in the 3 months before my sugery, I was on hormones to stop me from getting pregnant (in case I wasn't infertile that that point) as well as to surpress my period. Anyway, about ten days ago I found a solid mass area in my right arm pit, thinking it was nothing or from shaving I waited. When it didn't go away, I decided to have my GP check it, and I really really really convinced myself that it was a pimple that just hadn't surfaced. Well she did feel what I feel, and I am having an ultrasound tomorrow. While she felt it wasn't a pimple, she said it had a slight possibility of being swelling and I will be getting sick soon, she didn't feel comfortable not having it checked. She said there is still breast tissue in your underarm area, as well as the lymph nodes which swell or grow with infection and fighting infection but also with cancer cells. She checked my other armpit, and felt nothing, and also the lymph nodes in my neck and down the front of my breast and also felt nothing. I am scared to death, in part because I really did convince myself that she would say it was just under the surface and was nothing to worry about. Does anyone else out there have a similiar experience or maybe some web sites I can research so that when I do get my results I have some intellegent questions to ask? I was told that I could hear something anytime from Wednesday through Friday (hopefully I don't have to go through the weekend lol). Any advice will be apprecaited and warmly accepted. Thanks so much in advance.",
