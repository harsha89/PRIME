    "Content": "Hi everyone, just hitting the panic button here. Just had my DR. discover a flat , lima bean like shaped lump in my breast. I am very small breasted ( A-cup) so you can feel where the lump is, right up against my chest wall. OK I do not know alot about breast cancer, but I thought I read somewhere that if a lump is not \"floating\" or is attached it tends to be something bigger then cysts or what would usually be best cast senerio. I do realize I am panicing a bit, but had my maternal gr.mother die of breast cancer. I am hoping for some real life experiences here, words of wisdom. I am having a mammo, with an ultrasound next week......I HATE waiting. To top it off , strange as it may seem I did have a dream about 1 month ago about a sore on my breast that oozed out liquid. It was so weird that I told my husband about it. Any advice or insights would be greatly appreciated. I am not looking for best case senerio, just those with some experience in what I may be venturing into. Thanks ahead for your help. leigh",
