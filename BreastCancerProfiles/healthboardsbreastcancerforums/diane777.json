      "Content": "It does seem like there is some relation to the shots and getting this symptom even if you still have the pain after 3 months. Breast tissue seems to take a long time to heal, I've noticed after injury so maybe it's similar in this case. I don't want to guess what it could be, but I hope your tests are soon so you can find out. Good luck and please let us know how it turns out. Even if it is the worst thing, you are catching it very early, I think. The reason most men don't do well if they have breast cancer is because they do nothing about a symptom and ignore it until a very long time has passed. You aren't doing that, so I think they odds are in your favor.

      "Content": "Hi Sophie, I've learned that if your doctor is that negative and making you feel this way, that you should get another doctor. It can make all the difference. Like people are saying, everyone is different. Like the poster below who said her Stage IV mother lived 18 years!! There are so many alternative things you can do to build yourself up, too. Vitamin B17 is supposed to be excellent -- hard to get -- you have to order on-line. Don't let this doctor tell you anything negative. If he doesn't have any hope, then he is not good for you. Do you have other onc's on your health plan that you can choose and switch to? I had an onc 13 years ago who made me laugh and it made a difference. I felt safe and taken care of. Good luck to you. I do not think it is hopeless. It is different for each person. I know a guy who was given 6 months to live, and was still around 5 years later laughing at the doctors! Stay in touch!

It could be something like that since you are so young, but I would tell a doctor about it and have it examined just to be safe. No, I wouldn't be very worried. Try and relax until a doctor sees you.

      "Content": "I think it is ridiculous, too, that they won't prescribe a mammogram in this case. Some women never develop lumps (I'm one of them)! There is something you can do without a doctor's prescription because it's safe. But is costs about $200. If they won't do a mammo, you can get thermography done which can detect the heat in your breast. Cancer gives off more heat than healthy breast tissue so it can give them an idea of what is going. Thermography is also excellent as detecting inflammatory breast cancer before it is manifest -- mammo's can't do that. At least that's what I read. Diane",

      "Content": "Hi Sophie, I'm sorry about your diagnosis. I had my chemo 13 years ago and I remember the metallic taste in my mouth, too. I also could not bear the smell of plastic and almost developed a bionic ability to smell it from a distance. It would burn my nose so I had to get rid of anything plastic. The Zofran they put in my IV before the chemo took care of the tummy for it. I did not have vomiting. But....the anti-nausea meds like Zofran cause constipation, and they forget to warn you about this. So check with them beforehand about getting a good herbal (perhaps) laxative and take that the day after your chemo or you will get constipated. My stomach did not want anything heavy in it like proteins, etc. It only wanted raw and cool foods -- salads, fruits, etc. I think everyone's experience is a bit different so you may have some of the same things as I did or you might not. ALso -- Don't worry if you can't remember things after a few chemos. It effects short-term memory temporarily. You feel kind of cotton-headed. You might want to get some ice pops for the freezer beforehand. Those helped me. Good luck, and I sure wish you didn't have to go through this. I know the feeling. If it gets to be too much, tell them. They can hold off for a little bit and continue later. Please stay in touch and let us know how it goes.

      "Content": "You're right, a mammo would not be the best, given the location of the lump. I don't remember how much ultrasounds cost, but I think surgery would be a lot more. I also don't mind being cut into to remove something, so I understand how you feel. If they do go with the surgery, they usually like to see it beforehand on an ultrasound or something anyway so they get an idea of what they are dealing with. It would make a difference on how much or how little tissue they need to cut away. I also have eaten too much soy and also cabbage. Both things can depress thyroid activity. I have a thyroid disease now and I wonder if my overconsumption of cabbage and soy played a part in that. It may not have, but I have to eat both in moderation now. I never read that about cancers sometimes causing breast cysts. Thanks for the link. I like to learn something new. When is your next appointment? Let us know how it goes. If it's liquid-filled, it might be able to just be aspirated with a needle and you won't need surgery. If it is at all solid, though, I agree with you and would push to have it removed. Diane",

      "Content": "Hi Vegetarian -- I'm one, too. It seems to be a standard protocol to send a woman for an ultrasound after a mammogram. The first thing she should do is a mammogram, though. If you are 39 and never had one, you should get one now because this will be your \"baseline\" from which all future mammo's will be read. They recommend a baseline mammo to be taken between the ages of 35 and 40, so you are the right age. Judging by what the mammo shows, you might not need an ultrasound because the mammo could give them the info. they need for the diagnosis. Of course, ultrasounds are safe whereas mammo's give radiation so it won't hurt to get an ultrasound -- it's just that it's usually done after the mammogram. Let us know how it goes. Diane",

      "Content": "On the \"probability/suspicion for cancer is very low \", I have no confidence. In 1996, I was told the same thing by the surgeon and the doctor that saw my mammogram. And there was no rush (according to them) to remove it. But I knew inside me something was wrong so I told them I wanted it out. Turns out I was right. It was a 1.8 cm highly-malignant tumor. The doctors were shocked and embarrassed. They got it out just in time, and I've been ok ever since. Is there another doctor who is more skilled who can do the wire part to identify where the microcalcifications are? I agree with you on rather being safe than sorry. If they can't locate the microcalcifications, then get a doctor who can. Quote: Originally Posted by sarasota2004 I have an update from this original post! And still... I don't know what to do??? I have had 2 attempted stereotactic biopsies that couldn't be done due to the fact the microcalcifications are too small/fuzzy and hard to find during certain positions when attempting the biopsy. Breasts are extremely small too. The surgeon told me the only thing next to do to know what this is would be excisional surgery. But she says she and her radiologist feel that the probability/suspicion for cancer is very low and would suggest a follow up mammogram 6 months from the first mammogram (which would be in 2 months) and see if it changes. (funny, that's not what the suggestion was before the failed biopsy attempt). She said cancer doesn't usually lull around and eventually makes changes. And if the next mammogram has any sort of change/growth it can have a better chance of a sucessful biopsy. To make matters more challenging, she said if I opted for the surgery I would have to have the radiologist insert a wire to the tip of the area prior to going under and based on the fact the stereotactics couldn't work, there is a possibility that again, the radiologist won't be able to wire to area and I will not be able to have the surgery! And if that is the case... I will never know what the heck this area is!! Unless...it grows more to see it!? She said she would never open a breast up to take anything out unless it is clearly and absolutely marked where...and that is a challenge in my case. She said the choice is mine and she would be fine with either... attempt the surgery or another mammo in August. I asked if it were her what would she do? She said personally she would mammo it in August to see if there is a change but again, if they were ever wrong... I could have had this taken care of at surgery. I don't know what to do!! I wish I could know if the radiologist will be able to wire it prior to surgery but she said that is impossible until the day of surgery. Looking for opinions....",
