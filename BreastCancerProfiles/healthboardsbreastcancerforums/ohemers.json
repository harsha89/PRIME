    "Content": "Hi I'm 41 with dense lumpy breasts. I have had mammos and ultrasound to check lumps. I have noticed recently that there is an indent below my nipple of one breast when I raise my arms over my head. It is the size of the tip of my small finger-not deep. Should I be concerned or is this the aging process? My last mammo and ultrasound was one year ago. Any info would be appreciated.",
