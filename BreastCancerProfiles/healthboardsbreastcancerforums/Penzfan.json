      "Content": "This was the impression. My ultrasound before this said I had an area of multiple cysts which were likely the distortion, so I'm hoping that the results come back as benign. Impression: Upright stereotactic biopsy of an area of architectural distortion in the left breast at 2:00, with top hat clip placement. Pathology and recommendations are pending. The differential diagnosis includes a radial scar versus malignancy. If the pathology results are benign and do not include a radial scar or elastosis, I would consider the result discordant and recommend surgical consultation.",

      "Content": "This is what my mammogram stated. I am going back for a diagnostic mammo on July 5th and just wanted to know if anyone had any experience with this? Or am I worrying for nothing? Thank you! CLINICAL HISTORY: The patient is 47 years old and presents for routine screening. FINDINGS: Bilateral digital mammography with CAD reveals heterogeneously dense breast tissue, which may obscure small masses. The right breast shows no suspicious findings as compared to prior examination(s), the most recent of which is dated 06/04/2016. On the left, possible architectural distortion is noted for which additional evaluation is necessary. Impression No evidence of malignancy in the right breast. Incomplete examination of the left breast. RECOMMENDATION: Additional imaging is necessary of the left breast. We will contact the patient and ask the patient to return for further evaluation. OVERALL ASSESSMENT: BI-RADS: 0 - INCOMPLETE: NEED ADDITIONAL IMAGING EVALUATION RIS CODE: 3ADDLT",

What is a radial scar of the breast? A radial scar of the breast, and also known as complex sclerosing lesion of the breast, is a benign breast lesion that can radiologically mimic malignancy (cancer). They are rare and they do cause pain, because I do have pain where the lesion is located. Thank you again.",

      "Content": "Hi, I just had my yearly mammogram done a week ago, they did a 3-D on me this time because I do have dense breasts. They have repeatedly noted in my files that I do have normal stable variant asymetry in my left breast, but there are never changes to it. This time there appears to be a slight change and they want me to come in for additional views..on July 5th, so until then, me, a person who has horrible anxiety, has to worry. I am 47, have no family history. I do not have any lumps and they didn't say that I did, told me not to worry, if they found something significant, they would have me in sooner. But how do I not worry? ugh..",

Mine turned out to me a small mass, lump it was precancerous. I had a lumpectomy. Got it all and no further treatment needed. Do not in no way want to worry or scare you, but that was my outcome. So it is better to get more photos and maybe ultrasound and or biopsy too. I pray all okay for you. Thank you for asking! I actually just had a breast ultrasound this morning, the doctor said it is a radial scar that is typically benign, but still needs a biopsy, which we scheduled for early september. I guess I can breathe a sigh of relief now. I am very glad that yours was not cancerous and that you had it taken out. I'm sure they will want to take this radial scar out as well.",
