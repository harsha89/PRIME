    "Content": "Hi I get this same exact burning, stabbing pain in my left breast. Had mammorgram and ultrasound. Nothing was seen. I've been reading about non cyclical breast pain (not associated with the mentral cycle). It's rare, found mostly in women in their 40's and causes are still unknown. Some women find relieft with evening primrose oil or chasteberry. Mine waxes and wanes. I had it a year ago and then again in October and now again this month. It may have to do with the milk ducts or hormonal changes. I'm having another mammogram tomorrow just to get another look.",
