      "Content": "I am 28 years old, I have had two ectopic pregnancies, no live births. I have been experiencing swelling, redness, hot, tender, burning, itching (in both breasts)and a very strange sensation like I'm carrying a purse under my arm or laying on my left side I find myself feeling my left breast Is laying on a remote but nothing is there. I know because of my age and these symptoms being in both breasts has a higher chance it's not cancer? I do not know what this could be, the redness comes and gos but the fullness and other symptoms do not go away. Its been constant for a month now and I don't want to feel dumb asking the doctor as Im sure they wld say I'm too young. I have cysts in my breasts but I've never had any issues except during my cycle which was normal, but now cycle or not my breasts seem very angry. Can someone please tell me what this may be? Also, I just finished a round of zpac (antibiotic) for bronchitis and sinusitis and my breasts still have the same symptoms. Thank you for your time!",

      "Content": "Thank you so much for replying! I keep talking myself out of saying anything because the redness comes and goes. I have not changed any soaps or laundry soap so I know it is that part of the reason. I also thought mastitis but they said it happens only when breast feeding which I've never done. I've never had a pregnancy past 10 weeks. I've always had a terrible immune system and I'm use to beig sick honestly, and truthfully having cancer is concerning but I have an overwhelming peace about it all. I've read the treatment is so hard but I'm honestly more afraid of speaking up to my doctor about it. I'm so used to being sick I feel that I can get thru this with a positive attitude however I say that and I've never had cancer. I knew I something was wrong in December when they gave my a shot of chemo to help with my miscarriage, I kept saying no something's still not ok. Sure enough by the end of the week the day after Christmas they found out I had been bleeding internally. I can't shake that same feeling now. Are there any other infections it could be? I have a mammo and ultrasound sch for Wednesday because upon routine exam she found a lump in the left breast and I didn't tell her of my symptoms. The lump doesn't fit ibc so I'm still questioning and I read those tests won't see ibc? Thank you for all of your help! I've never been on a board before, and my sweet husband just doesn't understand. Thank you for being a voice on here! Thank you for reading! Olivia",
