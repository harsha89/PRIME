    "Content": "I just found this forum to ask a very similar question. I have had pain under my arm on my right side for a couple months, but feel no lumps etc. I also noticed that some bras really bothered me under my breast - more of a pain in the chest wall rather than the breast. This week, my breast has gotten tender - across the top - and my nipple has been very sensitive and sometimes itchy. Not quite sure what to make of it all. I do not feel any lumps, however I am scared to really feel around! Today I have had some heaviness in my chest - trouble breathing. Is this related to the chest/breast/under arm issues, or anxiety about the whole thing? I have an annual exam in a few weeks - can this wait to be checked out then, or before then? Scared it's something serious, but have no health insurance to make an unneccessary appt. Apprecitate any help!!!",
