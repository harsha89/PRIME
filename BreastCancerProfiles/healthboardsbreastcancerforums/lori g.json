    "Content": "I have the same type of bump, very tiny. It reminds me of a pimple that has not fully formed only that it has been there for about 5-6 months already. I know shame on me for never getting it checked out, I just didn't think it was anything of real concern. Thanks for both of your post, I will be calling my doctor for a appointment!",
