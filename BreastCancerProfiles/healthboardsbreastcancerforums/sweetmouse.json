The incision is healing nicely. the stress level these past four days was thru the roof .i wish they did not make you wait for the results..I was relieved to get good news today it was only a cyst..I felt a huge weight lifted off of my shoulders . the whole experience makes you look at your life differently....my prayers are with all of you who are going thru it also",
