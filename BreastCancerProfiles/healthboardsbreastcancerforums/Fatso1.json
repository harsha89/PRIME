      "Content": "Try to remember that 80% of lumps are not cancer. I just went through a week of hell because my mammogram showed something. I had to get an ultrasound, then a needle aspiration, then a biopsy. I had this done on 11/26 (the day before Thanksgiving). Anyway, I didn't get the results until yesterday, 12/1. It turned out to be something called Fibro adenoma. The dr. said lots of women have them - they are not malignant and won't become malignant. I am sure yours has something to do with hormones. You will be fine.",

Actually, he's 100% sure one is a fibroadenoma and fairly certain the other is as well- but the only way to know for sure is to do an ultrasound-guided biopsy. So, now I'm waiting for the procedure to be scheduled- and hoping I'll be in the 80% group-- meaning among those women whose biopsies turn out to show that there is no cancer. If anyone has had biopsy of fibroadenoma and can tell me more, I'd appreciate it. I thought fibroadenomas occurred only in women under age 40.",
