    "Content": "Call your local Cancer Society. They do offer free mamograms for woman without insurance, or without the funds to receive one. I think whatever problem you may be having, really needs the advice of a doctor. Or how about your local Health Department. There are many resources for those without insurance, students and low income families. Please look into my suggestions. Maybe someone else here can offer other suggestions. Good luck.",
