    "Content": "Hi, I am wondering if anyone has had a similar situation as the one I am currently in??? I felt a pea-sized mass in my left breast in November -- went to my internist (annual check-up) in December and I asked her to check it out. She could feel the lump, so ordered a mammogram. The mammogram was inconclusive, so they did an ultrasound that afternoon, which also turned out to be inconclusive. So, I just had am MRI of my left breast, and it didn't see anything. The odd thing is that the mass is still there! I am not sure what to do now. Anyone else experience something like this, and if so, what did you do? Thanks!",
