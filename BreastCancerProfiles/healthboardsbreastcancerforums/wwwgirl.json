      "Content": "Hey everyone. I had a lump on the underside of my breast and while I can't really tell whether or not a lump is there anymore, there is a deep purple spot which is kind of tender to the touch. My doctor told me when it was just a natural skin-colored lump that it was an infection and she put me on antibiotics. I took those but then shortly after I finished them, it turned into a tender deep purple colored spot. It is deep purple in the center which is kind of round and then adjacent to it is another circular shaped purple spot except this one is a lot less purple in color. It has been purple for at least a month now and before that it existed as a lump for a couple of weeks. I am really worried about this. Is my concern justified? Should I demand a mammogram? Also, I am a 28 year old female. I am on a Mirena IUD just in case that might cause something like this. That said, could it possibly be a blood clot? Finally, I apologize if I posted this in the wrong forum. I had no idea where to put it and this seemed to be the best place to me.",
