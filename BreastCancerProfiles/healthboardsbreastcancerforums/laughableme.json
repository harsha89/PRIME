      "Content": "I am 34 years old and have a family history of breast cancer (great grandmother and 2 great aunts died of bc). I have had a lump in my left breast for a month now. No changes during my cycle. It doesnt move and it is hard and firm. It is apprx 1.5 cm (grape size). My OBGYN tried to aspirate it assuming it was a cyst, but it was a solid mass. I am scheduled for a mammo and breast ultrasound in 2 weeks. I am very scared. From everything I can find on the internet, it doesnt sound like a fibroadenoma. There is no pain and no nipple discharge. I know that a biopsy is needed to determine anything, but all the literature I can find points towards Intraductal carcinoma. I have a 4 year old daughter and am a single parent. Of course I start thinking the worst. To make matters worse, my insurance runs out at the end of the month, so whether I have to have surgery or chemo/radiation; I wont be able to pay for it. Any advice or words of wisdom for a terrified mom?",

I will definitely keep my post up to date as I hope that you will do the same. Interested in seeing how yours turns out also. I hope that we both experience the best possible outcome. Good luck with your appointment. Thank your for your encouragement.",

      "Content": "UPDATE: I went for my mammogram and breast ultrasound this morning. It wasnt awful, just very uncomfortable. I think it was worse because I have larger breasts (44D). Plus me age makes my breast more dense, therefore they had to squeeze harder. Either way, my doctor called me back with in a few hours with my results. He said that my mammogram came back as a BIRAD 4. (For those of you that dont know, mammograms are graded on a scale of 0-6, depending on the suspicion for malignancy) They have scheduled me for an appointment this Thursday with a Oncologic Breast Surgeon. My doctor told me that he will probably do a biopsy that day right there in the office. So I still dont know much more than I did, but my worry level has gone up becuase I had hoped that it would turn out to be not suspicious. So again here I go with more waiting.......... Karen, how did your appointment go?",
