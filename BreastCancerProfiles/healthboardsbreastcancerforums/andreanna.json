    "Content": "I made a post about arm pit pain. I do feel a lump now but only when my arm is almost down. It does move but I can not squish it. Very odd. I can not find it at all when my arm is up? I hope anyone else with lumps gets good news as well. It isnt fun to find no matter where it is is it? Cancer runs ramped in my family.",
