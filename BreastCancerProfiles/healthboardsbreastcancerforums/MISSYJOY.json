The last ten days of waiting were agony and I'm grateful to have dodged the bullet. To put things into perspective, I sat with a woman who was having her 9th biopsy at the age of 38 and she very calmly told me that she was considering a double mastectomy due to her family history and constant problems. I can't say enough about the women who endure hell and fight back to live a normal healthy life. My heart goes out to each and every one of them.",

Everything I've read about \"the needle\", (from women who've gone through it) seems to indicate that it's very quick and not bad at all. Like you said, compared to the alternatives, it will be a piece of cake. Hopefully, neither of us will be posting next year after our mammograms!",
