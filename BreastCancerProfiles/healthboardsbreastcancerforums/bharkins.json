      "Content": "I had been on Femara for almost two years with horrible joint pain until my oncologist finally changed my medication to Aromasin. I experienced the same joint pain and developed a baker's cyst behind my right knee and could hardly walk. I do not know if the Aromasin was responsible for the cyst, but after receiving a cortisone shot in my knee to relieve the inflammation, I am pain free not only in my knee but I no longer have any pain in any of my joints.",

      "Content": "Hi Willow, I had a stereotactic biopsy. They put you face down on a table with a hole in it for the breast to be exposed. They raise the table and the doctor sits down low at the head of the table so that he can take the tissue to be biopsied from the exposed breast. The doctor will give you a needle to numb the breast area where he will take about six samples of tissue that is then sent to the lab to determine cancer or not. Just make sure that the area is good and numb before he takes the tissue. Make sure that he waits enough time for the numbness or you will feel some pain. It should be fine. Good Luck.",

Not all calcification means breast cancer, but I would not wait 12 months. I would discuss with my doctor the possibility of having a followup mammo sooner. Good luck.",

My medical oncologist has mentioned that I will be put on arimidex because I had a stroke six years ago and there is less chance of blood clots with arimidex. I already have osteoarthritis and after reading these posts, I am petrified about taking arimidex. Is there anyone out there that did not experience joint pain while taking this med?",

The surgery under the arm felt sore longer than the breast, but I must say that the entire experience was not bad at all. The radiation treatment was nothing. The killer is the side effects of the femara which has to be taken for five years after. Good luck to you.",

I have trouble sleeping, experience excessive sweating when nobody else is even the least bit hot, get up from a chair and walk like an old lady, knees kill me when I attempt to go up or down stairs and have gained weight and cannot seem to lose it. Anyone else experience this on Femara? I am afraid not to take it because of the alternative.",
