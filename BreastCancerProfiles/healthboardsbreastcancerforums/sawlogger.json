I am on thyroid meds and blood pressure meds, but have been on them for years and have had no pain before. I sometimes wonder if the squeezing them during the mammogram can cause damage. Thanks for you answer.",

      "Content": "I am having a lot of pain in my breast. I just had my yearly mammogram 4 months ago and everything looked fine. My breast is very sore and has been for about 2 months on and off. It started out like a stabbing pain that you get with a charley horse and now aches quite often and deep. There is no lump. I mentioned it to my dr. and she just said there is usually not pain if cancer. I will have to go back and have it checked, but don't know what can be causing it. Has anyone experienced this/ I am in my 50's. Thanks",
