    "Content": "Hey, I was wondering if you ever found out what the cause of this was? Your problem sounds exactly like mine. I went to the dr today and they are sending me for a mammogram just to be safe. She said it she doesnt think it is cancer and that it could be my chest wall. I have scoliosis and one side of my back is fuller so its possible my chest is the same way. Obviously I am freaking out though I am only 21 and never thought I could have breast cancer!",
