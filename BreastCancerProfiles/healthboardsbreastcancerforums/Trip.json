    "Content": "Jill, I am a 45 yr old woman who has had 2 lumpectomies. My 1st they tried to aspirate due to they thought it was a cyst, which they couldn't, so they sent me to a doctor specifically dealing with breast cancer. My mother has had breast cancer and is now cancer free, and this Doc is her Doc as well. I too have very dense breasts, and is very difficult to determine whats there. The surgery is really not that bad at all, and, as the previous person said, taking it all out resolves any issues. Currently I have a few cysts, which are just mointored, due to cysts are basically begnin. If you have a family history, have had numerous lumpectomies, dense breasts, issues like this, it's best to see a specialist. I have a mammogram, then 6 mos. later a ultra sound, I am examed 2x a year. I was even given the option of starting on Taxofimon (spel?) which is a anti tumor drug used for breast cancer, or as a preventive measure with people @ high risk, but I chose to have more exams, I wasn't quite sure I wanted to chance the side effects. There is a calculator, called the \"Gail Monitor\" that a Doctor can fiqure your odds for breast cancer on, you can even look that up on the internet...I did, after my Doc fiqured out my odds, and sure enough, my results were the same as hers Good Luck with everything!....Debi",
