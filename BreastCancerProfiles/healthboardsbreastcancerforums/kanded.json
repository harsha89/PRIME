    "Content": "The chances of having cancer in both breasts in the same place at the exact same time is practically impossible. It is good that you have them in the same place, as that indicates symmetry. Some signs of possible problems might be: Dimpling, puckering or bulging of the skin A nipple that has changed its position or an inverted nipple Redness, soreness, rash, swelling Discharge from the nipples Some people just have lumpy breasts, but it is always good to follow up with a specialist, such as an OB/GYN, just to be on the safe side as things can develop later. If breast cancer runs in your family, you should be checked every 6 months to 1 year but certainly go back sooner if you're worried or seek a second opinion. Its important to have current scans so they can compare them to the past ones and see if there are any changes. As women, pollutants or poor diet choices affect us in our breasts and our organs, so keep yourself healthy, and don't drink too much caffeine. That seems to have caused me problems with my breasts, because I can notice a difference after drinking coffee or soda. (itchiness,etc) Hope this helps.",
