      "Content": "tHANKS SO MUCH FOR YOUR SUPPORTIVE EMAIL- IT REALLY HELPS- THINGS ARE NOT GREAT W/ MY HUSBAND AND I- CAUSE OF ALL THE TENSION- PLUS HIS BACK IS OUT- WE ARE ONLY MARRIED 5 YRS- ( THE LAST 2 HAVE BEEN EMBROILED W/ THIS BREAST CANCER THING- AND WE CAN'T SEEM TO GET THE SPARK BACK IN ANY SENSE- IT IS REALLY SAD. iT IS A 2ND MARRIAGE- i WAS DIVORCED FOR 21 YRS BEFORE I REMARRIED- AND I NOW FEEL THAT WE SHOULD HAVE REMAINED SIGNIFICANT OTHERS AND LIVED IN SEPARATE PLACES. MY WORK, WHICH WAS a great sense of joy- has really gone down hill- cause I had all my students in another state - and when i moved here- which is about an hour away- ihad to cut back the commute- it was too much- hours in the car- -i send all the money i do earn- to my daughter- well- at least i have an affliation w/ an arts council where I teach 1 time a week- but I used to work w/ young adults and adults- and it is just children now- not as rewarding intellectually- but I am holding on to it- I am trying very hard to be greatful for other things I have- and not be so hard on myself- it is very hard living in this house like 2 strangers- who barely say goodmorning- or goodnight. Listen- I think I have to get off the pity pot- and just move on- and accept where things are now-and get joy where I can . Best to you and be well.",

I would suggest that if you do start an anti-depressant..ask that you start with the lowest possible dosage..especially given the fact that you have had some problems in the past. Red, vaginal dryness is a common side effect.. I have spoken to my gyn, and onc about it and KY lubricant was suggested..I prefer the warming gel.. It is sold over the counter, so you can pick it up without a prescription..but do speak to you doctor about it just to make sure its right for you. hugs, cj. hI yOU are so nice to get back to me- I know the journey is hard- what I didn't tell you is that my 38 yr old daughter was diagnosed the same time as I was-( just by luck I had her go for a Mamo when I was daignosed- she had a very agressive tumor- Brac2 gene( which I don't have but found out her Dad ( we are divorced had)- she had a double mast. and a complete hysterectomy- she has 2 young girls( one of which is diabetic- so it has been very difficult to watch her go through this- I financially help out alot- I still work part time- her husband does very poorly financially- so it has been a rough 2 yrs. I will try the warming gel- got vit e supposotories- and am willing to try- right now things are so strained between my husband and I = I wonder when we will ever get together. But hopefully all this strain will pass- I pray every day for my daughter- and just am trying to accept it more gracefully w/o being a complete witch- which I have been.",

I am in therapy- but I still am having a hard time. Do you get any of the symptoms I have described? Hope all is well- keep in touch. Red",

My endocronologist said I was lucky I didn't get breast cancer first- or I wouldn't have been able to take Forteo- which definitely helped)- taking arimidex would just knock it back badly( my scores) on the bone density- the problem is - the numbers- and my oncologist- who keeps telling me that my chances of recurrence are diminished by taking 2 or 3 yrs of Arimidex or Femara- so I guess it boils down to- want to have fractures of a spine. or another breast cancer- what a choice- guess nothing is easy . any feedback out there",

My radiation oncologist saw it too- said nothing to worry about- I asked about IBC- said not to worry- but I am really scared and worried- the creams( benedryl ) don't help- I next see a dermatologist- but not for a wk= really concerned- In my heart- it doesn't feel like it is just a rash- I never saw anything like it.",
