      "Content": "Hello, This is my pathology report after having a core needle biopsy (after seeing micro calcifications for the 2nd time): Diagnosis of focal atypical ductal hyperplasia, columnar cell hyperplasia without atypia, calcifications detected microscopically in benign and atypical ducts is concordant with the imaging findings. This is considered a high risk lesion. I don't have any BC in my family. I am seeing a BS on Monday. Any insight from other experiences would be appreciated. Thanks!",
