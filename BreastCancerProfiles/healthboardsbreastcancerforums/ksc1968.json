    "Content": "I have fibrocystic breasts. I have a mammo every year since I turned 30. After the mammo I always go to the ultrasound room. I have some very large cysts along with alot of smaller ones. I had over 35 at my last ultrasound (creepy). I get new ones frequently and it can be scary, but I always follow through with them with my Dr. Never assume a new lump is a cyst! Always be safe.",
