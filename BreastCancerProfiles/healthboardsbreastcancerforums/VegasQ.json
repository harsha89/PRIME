      "Content": "My daughter has been complaigning of her left breast hurting. She was so excited it was \"growing\" so I did a breast exam like the ones I get at the OBGYN. She does actually has a hard lump under her left nipple thta is distinct and not on her right side. It is about the size of a pea. Has anyone ever heard of this at her age? I am making an appointment with her doctor tomorrow so I'll advise more. I guess since she's 48lbs it is easy to feel and definiately not on the right. Anyone else experience this? Thanks! Suz",
