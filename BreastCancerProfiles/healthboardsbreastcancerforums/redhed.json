      "Content": "Hello everyone..i'm new here and would love some imput on a situation i'm having. I found a pea sized knot in my breast about a month ago. Went to my obgyn who went me to a surgeon. Im 34..he did an ultrasound found the lump measuring .45cm x .25cm. He wants to do surgery and then a biopsy because he says the fna (fine needle aspiration) wont work due to that the lump is too close to the surface. He says its solid but other than that he doesnt know. What should I do? If it were you would you get a second opinion or just have the surgery? Redhed",
