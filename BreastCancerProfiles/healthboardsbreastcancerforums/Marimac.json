Can someone tell me about the lump? How does it feel like when you touch it and is it noticable? Oh god...I dont wanna go to the doctor to find out its my bone or something. Im 15 by the way... thanks! Some questions to ask yourself before you panic: Do you drink a lot of caffienated beverages? Cokes, coffee, tea, chocolate? If you do, then it could be a reaction to that and you would merely have to cut back and the lumps would disappear. If you have a first degree relative in your family such as mother, sister who has had breast cancer, then I would go have it checked out. There is no bone in the breast tissues. There is only fatty tissues, lymph and blood veins. These things are supposed to be there. If you are finding a lump that is hard enough to believe it is bone, you need to have an adult female, mom or sister to check it out first and then get them to help you to decide what to do next.",

These form letters (they must send them to patients by law I learned from the technician - otherwise they would only send the full report to the doctor and ignore the patient, I imagine) seem to be way too general to tell us anything. And it has been more than 1 week and I have not heard from my doctor's office where they should have gotten the full report by now. And I don't want to call them until the results of this next X-ray come in. But it is awful to wait, not knowing much and worrying! Can I assume my right breast looked OK? And are overlapping densities likely to be due to an abnormality? Or just lots of dense breast tissue? Thanks, Bev That report means that you are young enough that dense breast tissue kept them from seeing anything one way or the other. In fact the doctor may decide to try to do ultrasound instead in order to distinguish the tissues. So far that is a good thing that nothing important stands out to them. I hope that the news remains good news.",

However, the lump is still there and my period ended yesterday. I was just wondering whats the time frame for it to fade away? Does the lump fade right after your period or will it take a few more days? I have been doing extensive research on breast lumps to ease my mind... So far, I have gathered that thin woman and woman will small breasts are able to detect the muscles in the breasts that is suppose to cover the ribs and sometimes can feel like layers of lumps. I THINK that my case can lean towards this because I am thin and I have very small breasts, approximately 30/32A. Do you think this is a possibility? The thing is that the lump on my left breast is definitely more distinguished and larger than my right one. It feels as if my right has a TINY lump, barely noticable. Once I fix things up with my health care profession, I will go and get an examination just to be on the safe side but it might take awhile. I cant help but worry and stress over this. I guess I kinda want some reassurence in the meantime... Thanks for listening to me ramble on. Please post your thoughts/suggestions! Thanks again! It is very difficult to get a clear picture of lumps and bumps when you are having periods because hormone cycles will cause the lumps to appear. The best rule of thumb while waiting for a doctor's appointment, is to pick one day out of the month each month and check on that same day month to month. If something is different from one month to the next then have it checked out. In women who still have strong cycles, there are two times that they are most likely to have hormone changes? at ovulation and the week before the period actually starts. In some women whose cycles are kind of off schedule. This is really troublesome to try to figure out what is going on. So, get your appointment with your doctor. Get the all clear on what is normal for you. Then monitor obvious changes.",

Never had a mammogram before. I hear it is like somebody stepping on your boobs with big steel boots. Some of the under arm tissue is visible if they position the machine just right. They can do an MRI if anything suspicious shows up on the regular machine. Also don't worry too much about the painfulness until you get the pictures. Too much coffee, tea, or monthly hormone fluctuations can cause achey feeling or burning feeling. Lumps and bumps are a lot of times, your body doing the job it is supposed to be doing which is cleaning out infection. Don't panic and remember, some people are more sensitive to pressure on the breast than other. It is pressure but you need to politely tell the technician if it hurts because it could cause bruising that would show up as something suspicous if they injure you while doing the test.",

Alisha I want to wish you the best. I am guessing the black discharge is probably dry old blood. It sounds like at the very least you have a mammary cyst or a gland that has become infected. I hope that this can be alleviated soon. Good luck.",

In 2003 there were changes in my mammo so they had me get an untrasound too. I was sent to a surgeon who said that the cysts looked fluid filled so he declined to do a biopsy/aspiration at that time but wanted me to get a mammo & an ultrasound yearly instead of just the mammo. I just went a couple of days ago for my annual and the diagnostic center wants me to come back in 2 months to look at a cyst that developed in my left breast that seems to look blood filled. My left breast has lots of cysts the largest at 3 cm. My right breast has cysts but not as many. The blood filled cyst is under 1 cm. My doctor is sending me to a surgeon to let him review my reports and mammo/ultrasound and examine me. I am worried because I read the booklet in the diagnostic center and it stated that if the cyst has blood or other matter in it, it needs to be sent to the lab to check for cancer. I am 47 years old pre-mense, the only breast cancer in my family that know about is my 1st cousin on my mom's side. She is 48 and was diagnosed in her late 30's. Should I see the surgeon or should I just wait 2 months and go back for the 2nd ultrasound? Should I worry? my Dr's office seemed to leave it up to me if I want to go to the surgeon or wait for the ultrasound. I think this is a time when you should go with what ever makes you most comfortable. My understanding is that breast cancer, if it is diagnosed, is not an emergency and that you should take time to review all of your options so that you make an informed decision. If you are more comfortable going to the surgeon rather than waiting two month for another ultrasound, then you should do so. If you have cancer, waiting the two months will not be too long to wait for treatment to begin if you had rather wait longer.",
