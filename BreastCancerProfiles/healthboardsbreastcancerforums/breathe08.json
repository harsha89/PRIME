      "Content": "I think women need to be push for better imaging diagnostics. Computers are strong enough now that we should have powerful pattern recognition software that reduces the need for so many biopsies. Cystic breast changes are a normal condition for women, moreso when we are middle-aged. Too many of us are losing large amounts of money, time, and emotional well-being because of excessive use of biopsies. We need better tools to tell when they are actually needed. The diagnostics right now are at the level of not being able to tell a freckle from a melanoma. Can you imagine if we kept getting surgery for freckles? Be well, speak out, connect, K",

      "Content": "I am being evaluated for a complicated cyst. I think it got complicated because there is scar tissue in that area from where I had a surgical biopsy. Complicated cysts by themselves are almost never cancer, but if there is also thickening then sometimes they are. I'm basing this on what the nurse told me and a study that I found online by searching on complicated cyst.",

      "Content": "I'm wondering how many people have had doctors pay attention to where you are in your menstrual cycle when they schedule your breast biopsy or surgery. There seems to be quite a few studies in serious journals that indicate that timing matters in terms of outcomes. (I searched \"breast biopsy menstrual\".) I'm on my sixth biopsy and no one has ever discussed this with me at all.",
