The office was closed before she could return the call. The poor woman was a wreck all weekend from thinking she had cancer. We were furious when we found out it was just a bad image and the fault of the technician.",

      "Content": "This means that they saw some dense tissue. It's probably nothing but of course everything has to be checked out. I hate the weird words they use. My girlfriend freaked out all weekend because they left a voice message on Friday afternoon to report that an \"artifact\" was found. Too late to call back, the office was closed. She thought for sure she had cancer. Come to find out on Monday that the tech made a mistake doing the mammogram. That's what \"artifact\" meant. These people should be required to speak in plain English!",
