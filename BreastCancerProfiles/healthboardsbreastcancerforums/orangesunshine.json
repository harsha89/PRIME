    "Content": "Hello, I never expected anything unusual after getting a mammogram, but I received a letter from the radiologist on Monday telling me I needed to return for further testing. I called my doctor's office and asked them to fax the report to me. It says there is microcalcification in my left breast that needs to be evaluated further. A few months ago I had a tumor panel ran and my CA-15-3 came back elevated. The high reference was 25 and mine was 33.4. My doctor poo pooed it and we literally had words about his indifference, which I thought was crazy! I get false negatives and that it CAN be other things (although mostly other kinds of cancer), but it is used as an indicator and in my opinion should be investigated, not ignored. Since it just happened to be time for my mammogram I went ahead and did it. I'm 57 with no breast cancer family history and I know I do not carry the BRAC gene since I've had my dna ran in 23andme (ovarian cancer does run in my family, however). I do remember when I had the mammogram my left breast was very tender and it hurt, while my right breast didn't hurt at all. I have an odd question. I also have calcification in my left rotator cuff that was diagnosed in April of this year and actually caused a full tear and separation in one of the tendons in my left rotator cuff. I was scheduled to have surgery in June, but postponed it because I didn't feel well. And last year I was diagnosed with cataracts in both eyes, which can also be caused by calcification. The opthamologist said I was a baby to have cataracts. I'm curious if anyone with breast microcalcifications have had other calcification issues as well? Thanks! Best wishes and hugs to all! Carol",
