    "Content": "So my breast specialist showed me my mammogram and since I have dense breasts I have white Ares. She said those white areas are where cancer can white hide. So I am suppose to go for breast MRI sometime soon. Also having the genetic testing. A lot to take in, following my 82 year old mom just having breast cancer in December 2013. Have any of you had these problems with dense breasts?",
