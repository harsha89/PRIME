    "Content": "Hello All, Has any one had these same problems? Long term breast cyst , that no one seemed too worried about. Recent re occurence of ovarian cyst, even though I am 4 years postmenopausal. In one months time I have been sick with fever and sore throat with big nodes on neck two different times. Feelings of nausea after eating even small amounts of food. Now today I have very tender and palpable lymph nodes axillary levels II. These are located just even to armpit area but 3 - 5 inches toward the center of my chest. Same side as the 5 yr + breast cyst. I also have tender & palpable nodes in my groin area. I had a CA125 last week, it was ok. Waiting on Pap results and need to get another mammogram. Had one done 14 months ago. Also had diagnostics and ultrasound of breast. Radiologist said it was just a cyst and not to worry. What do they know ? Breast cancer ? Lymphoma ? Nothing ? Just getting older ? Thanks",
