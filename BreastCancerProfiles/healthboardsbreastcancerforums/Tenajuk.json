      "Content": "I'm really worried - got a mammogram recall letter on Friday evening to be seen on Tues. I had my first mammogram recently and just assumed it'd be normal. I'm gutted cos I'm getting a puppy on Sat - I've been so excited and looking forward to getting him for several weeks - we even drove over 200 miles to visit him. I paid for him have bought a crate and playpen toys and had puppy harnesses made for him. If I need chemo I won't be able to have my pup - this will be like a bereavement. He already feels like part of our family. He is my reward for 3 years of surgery on my feet and finally getting back to normal health and activity levels. I know it might not seem rational but I understand there is .only a 1 in 4 chance this is going to be cancer so there is a higher chance it is nothing to worry about - but if I have cancer I will be upset enough but to loose our new puppy too will be really gutting. I was bursting with excitement looking forward to collecting him until I opened that letter on Friday. I guess only a dog lover will understand my loss of perspective.... . Am I right though that this would mean giving up the pup?",

It's an 11cm in diameter area they think it's harmless but will confirm it next week - and written down suspect it's hyperplasia. Whatever that is.",

      "Content": "So I phoned the number it says to ring if we have any concerns or anxiety over being recalled for more tests - given we are now in the 20% risj group for cancer instead of the 1% I think most people recalled would have anxieties! Anyway after waiting all weekend because they were closed they now have an answering machine saying they have no one who can take our calls. Bloody NHS at it's best! Sat bloody crying now! My mum was terminally ill with cancer by the time she was 35.",

      "Content": "I've left another message - this time with my phone no! Too much panic last time and I forgot to say who I was. The nurse rang back she said she had 5 calls this morning by people in too much of a panic to remember to leave their details! She checked my file says it's cos it's the first mammogram so they don't know what's normal for me. The xray found a pea sized something and they just need to find out what it is - and it's most probably just a cyst and nothing to worry about but they need to make sure. They will do more xrays, an examination, ultrasound and a needle aspiration to find out what it is. If they have any concerns they will do a biopsy. The results will take a week. But they will tell me tomorrow if it is likely to be anything nasty and if to go ahead with the puppy or not. And even so the breeder would hold the pup for an extra week until the results come in if need be. But most likely is a cyst.",

My hubby wasn't going to go with me but he's just agreed to get the time off and go with me - it says on the letter he can come too. Fingers crossed then for them just needing more pics. Thanks. x",

Just says you need to go back for a three hour appointment for another mammogram, inspection/consultation, ultrasound and possibly a biopsy and to be told the results. But not to worry... lol .",
