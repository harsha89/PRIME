      "Content": "Looking for some support and or input on whether I should get tested for the BRCA1 gene. My maternal great-grandmother and maternal grandmother both died of breast cancer. My mom passed away from heart problems but the doctors told us she tested positive for some cancer markers, but because she was in congestive heart failure and we were all just devastated at that time I don't really know what markers they found. Last year, I had an excisional biopsy to remove a radial scar lesion. Though benign, they have diagnosed it as atypical ductal hyperplasia and I should be monitored every 6 months. They never discussed the BRCA test. My sister did it and she was negative but I know that doesnt mean I will be negative. I have mulitple fibroadenomas and guess I am just worried about whether or not I should get this test done. I also worry because I did undergo 7 years of fertility treatment with lots of estrogen and progestin therapies. From anyone's experience, do I sound like a good candiate for this test and how difficult is it to get the insurance companies to approve the test. Thanks Emma",
