      "Content": "Hi Everyone, I was just hoping for some answers or some information from someone that may have calcifications. I am now 45 and have been going for regular mammos since I was 39 - everything was normal. There is no history of breast cancer in my direct family bloodline, though my grandmother's sister had it. But even she lived into her 90's and didn't die from it. Anyway, in July of 2006 I went for my annual mamm and was asked to come back for additional pictures as there were calcifications noted. I went back the following week and was told to re-check in 6 months, and they wanted to \"watch and see\". I went back in January 2007 (6 months later) and was told it looked fine, not to worry and come back in 6 months. If in 6 months there was no change, I could get back on a regular annual schedule. I went back in July 2007 and received a letter in the mail stating there were no abnormalities and I could return in a year for my regular screening. I have never felt a lump and neither has my OB/GYN. Fastforward to Nov 2007: My sister-in-law whom I dearly love has just been diagnosed with what they believe is stage 1 (maybe stage 2) breast cancer. So naturally I am freaking out and \"feeling myself up\" every night! I have never been told to have an ultrasound, MRI or biopsy and wondered if anyone else on the boards had calcifications with a similar result? Did you wait the 12 months before having another mammogram? I had four over a 12 month period and wondered if I should return this January to be sure?",

      "Content": "I just received my mammo films and reports in the mail. (I have moved to another state and needed them to take to my new doctor) I looked at what caused all the concern, and it was a tiny, tiny dot on one of the pictures. It almost looked like a faulty film. My last mammo was normal (indicated as: Negative - 0) and there was no indication of the prior calcification. So here's my question: Can calcifications disapear? I looked at the very last picture (done in July 2007) and the spot was gone! Is that possible?",
