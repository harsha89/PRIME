      "Content": "Hello all, I or my husband perform breast exams monthly. Until this month, we have felt nothing...until just a couple of days ago when he found a little pea size lump on my right breast near the nipple. It is hard and doesn't seem mobile. I am 25 and have never had children, there is also no breast cancer in my family. I have an appnt tomorrow with my Gyn, but am wondering if anyone could provide any insight into how their lumps felt and if they were anywhere near mine. I am a very anxious person, so this doesn't help!!! I'm very scared. ...I have also just recently gone off of the pill...3 months and am ovulating. Thanks for your help!",
