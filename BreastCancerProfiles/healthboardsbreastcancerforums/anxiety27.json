      "Content": "My mother is a 5 and a half year breast cancer survivor, only to have been just recently diagnosed with a reacurrance of it. She is now in the process of investigating the \"hot spots\" that have shown up on the PET scans, which have all been coming up as negative for cancer. She has one more to go... This is absolute torture for her, as it is for us to watch her go through this. I have been doing numerous searches on line at an endless rate only to find very devastating survival numbers. Is there anyone out there who has beaten this a second time, or knows of anyone who has??? There has to be some good news out there somewhere... I am worried sick.",
