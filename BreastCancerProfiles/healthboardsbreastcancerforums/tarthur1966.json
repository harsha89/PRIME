    "Content": "I don't know your age, but I would not take any chances I would go see a doctor. It may not be anything, but why take the chance. I had a lump under my arm pit last year and waited to see a doctor, until we had health insurnace. I had a mammogram on Nov 11, 2006, and since then have had to have a mastectomy, and have to start chemo in Jan. Please take my advice and see a doctor. I am not trying to scare you, I am just concerned and would not wish what I am going through on any one.",
