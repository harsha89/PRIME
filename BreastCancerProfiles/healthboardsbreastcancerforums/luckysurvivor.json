      "Content": "After doing an EXTENSIVE amount of research and getting a second opinion from an oncologist at Beth Israel Deaconess Center in Boston, I reluctently decided to do \"something\" rather than discontinue any form of treatment after completing the Herceptin. The main reason is that two separate experts recommend either tamoxifen or ovarian suppression. Ovarian removal is a last resort but not one that I will even consider based on the results of a large scale study. Tamoxifen or ovarian suppression are recommended because there is no conclusive clinical data yet available for those of us with negative nodes who have been treated since 2006 with Herceptin. I can't let my gut feeling that I won't have a recurrence override two experts whose opinions I trust and value. I'll never forgive myself if I stop treatment on my own and have a recurrence of this nasty disease because I didn't follow their advice. Yes, their advice is only an educated guess, but I decided to go ahead with further treatment until clinical data supports otherwise. I went on Tamoxifen for 1.5 years and it was not the drug for me. I suffered from muscle cramps, night sweats more often than hot flashes, bloating, and most recently developed a uterine polyp that fortunately was benign. Recent research done on women who take Tamoxifen after Herceptin is now available and it indicates that, because of cross-talk between cells, Herceptin PROBABLY causes us to become resistant to Tamoxifen. Some research even suggests that for us, Tamoxifen may act as a pro estrogen! My oncologist and I discussed this research at my last appointment and since then, I have discontinued the Tamoxifen. Seeing that I am only 2.5 years since my diagnosis, I reluctantly decided to try ovarian suppression with Lupron. I'm terrified of this and anyone who does research on this treatment would feel the same after reading what side effects others have experienced from Lupron. I have only had one injection so far and my next is due next week. So far, I feel \"different\" but not yet as bad as I felt on the Tamoxifen. I know that ovarian suppression will lead to further bone loss. I had a DEXA scan done 6 months ago and despite my exercise and nutritional regimen for preserving my bone density, I have osteopenia in my hip and am borderline osteoporotic in my lumbar spine. Because the only guarantee I have with ovarian suppression is that my bone density will continue to decrease, I have firmly decided to play the percentages with my treatment for recurrence. All indications are that HER2+ tumors, if they recur, will most likely do so within the first 2 years of diagnosis. If it hasn't returned by the 3rd year, it MOST LIKELY won't. So, I will do my best to continue with ovarian suppression until I reach my 3 year mark (October 2011). If the side effects of the Lupron become unmanageable before then, I will quit early. I'm not having my ovaries removed. If I'm lucky and the Lupron is tolerable, in Oct. I will have a repeat DEXA scan, and if my bone density is worse, I'm stopping all further cancer treatment. I will have \"beat the odds\" and I will be able to live with my decision. I will then begin any treatment to rebuild my bones and go on with my life. If the Lupron is tolerable and my bone density has not decreased, I would consider continuing the ovarian suppression until I can't take the side effects any longer. I hope this helps. As I said, I have done EXTENSIVE research and can quote all of the studies that back up the data I have referred to. I hope you make a decision that you can live with. There really is just not enough clinical data available at this point in time to strongly support the idea of further treatment after Herceptin. And, by the way, both of my oncologists have not seen a recurrence of HER2+ cancer in patients treated with Herceptin since 2006. Thank God every day for Dr. Dennis Slamon and his development of the wonder drug Herceptin. I wish you peace with whatever decision you make.",

      "Content": "I had a bilateral mastectomy because of 2 tumors in the same breast (one was 1.6 cm, the other 2.6 cm). My lymph node was negative. Because the tumors were Her2 positive (also ER+ and PR+), I agreed to 4 cycles of chemo (taxotere and carboplatin) with Herceptin infusions every 3 weeks. This treatment lasted for one calendar year. Now that I am finished, my oncologist recommended that I go on Tamoxifen. Is there much added benefit to continuing with tamoxifen and then an aromatase inhibitor for the next 5 years? I have been on the tamoxifen for 6 months now and I have muscle cramps, hot flashes, and night sweats. I have also gained 7 pounds so far with no change in eating or exercise habits. I am a very active 49 year old woman and I work out daily doing a combination of yoga, weight lifting, and bicycling. I ride close to 100 miles per week. I feel and look very healthy. I'm very discouraged with taking the tamoxifen because I feel as if the side effects are outweighing the potential benefit of the drug. I believe that a healthy body and healthy immune sysytem is my best medicine and I feel the tamoxifen is beginning to threaten mine. Does anyone have experience with a similar treatment or know how much of an added benefit the tamoxifen really has to offer me?",
