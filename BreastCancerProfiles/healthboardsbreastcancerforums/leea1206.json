Nevertheless, I would DEFINETELY get the mammogram. -You can never be too careful about these things. As I understand it today's mammograms give only a fraction of radiation, that the old mammos gave. It really is better to be safe than sorry and to know for sure what you are dealing with. Are they going to do an ultrasound too? Sometimes these catch things, not seen on mammogram. I am one yr out form stage 1 breast cancer. - Mine was caught on a routine mammogram.

I also had a sterostatic biopsy. The lab report showed beniegn micro calc and I was to come back in 6 mths to moniter it. I did the repeat mamo in 4/06. This time something suspicious was found in the L breast. This time had a core biopsy. Unfortuntately turned out to be cancer but very early stage 1. R breast was fine. Anyway d/t family hx, I opted for bilateral mast and then was on tamox. I did have genetic testing and was found not to be BRCA positive (BRCA cancer is usually more aggressive). I was not working at the time, so don't know how it would affect work/insurance issues. Our insurance company did pay in full. (It is a very expensive test >$3,000.) Anyway, it is now 4 yrs later and I am doing well. - I was dxed at 48. Hope I answered some of your questions. Leea",

      "Content": "I have had flap reconstruction. I had a bilateral mast in May of 06. I waited to research my options and than had I-GAP in March of 07. With I-GAP they use fat from your lower-outer behind to create the breasts. They do this if they think you don't have enough tummy to reconstruct. It is a big surgery; 7hrs for me, with two surgeon's, one doing each breast, but I would do it again in a minute, as I am very happy with the results. To prepare for flap surgery, I would: -Make sure you are in the best possible shape, physically and emotionally. -Eat healthy and take at least a multivitamin, get enough rest and light exercise or activity to make sure your immune system is strong. -Envision your surgery going well. Decrease stress, if you can. -When you go to the hospital pack some loose or button-down tops. -I stayed in the hospital 4 days. -After surgery you will have a pain pump. I did not have alot of pain d/t the pump and oral pain meds. -You will probably be very weak and tired and possibly nauseous those 1st few days d/t the anesthesia and meds. Rest, rest rest! BUT, they will also encourage you to walk the halls to prevent blood clots. Also drink lot's of water and deep breathing or coughing is good to get the anesthesia out of your sytem and keep your lungs strong. - It took me about 2 weeks to feel semi-normal and about 4 wks to feel almost back to my old self. -One thing you will have are drains. The docs all have different criteria for when to remove drains. That was the worst part for me and mine stayed in the lower hip area almost 4 wks. BUT, if you do the tummy fat surgery (DIEP) I don't think the drains have to stay in as long. After surgery, just try to pace yourself and listen to your body. I was 49 when I had the surgery and in good shape but a big surgery like that still takes alot out of you. Good luck and let us know what you decide. Leea -",

The reason I delayed, is I was so overwhelmed with all the \"reconstruction choices\", that I wanted to wait. The masts were in 06 and then reconstruction in Spring of 07. Anyway, you are talking about mast with \"immediate\" reconstruction. Regarding bilateral mast, surprisingly recovery is about a week. I was amazed how good I felt, even in 24hrs. Had to rest alot and took a long nap each afternoon but otherwise was able to move around as usual. - Although they do warn you about reaching above your head and lifting, of course. By about day 5, I even went to see a movie with my sister. You will have drains and they will be taken out in about a week,as well. I did not get implants, but used my own tissue for the reconstruction. If you get implants, from what i've heard, the recovery is easier. So I would say you should be able to go back to work in 1 week. - But you could ask for 2 weeks if you want to get extra rest, make sure you are totally healed and the drains are out. Leea",

As far as tamox vs Femara, it is true if you are premenopausal, they only offer tamox. You are not supposed to take any of the arromatase inhibitors like femara, if you are premenopausal. - Anyway, I was premenopausal at 48 when dxed and now 50. I am certain I would still be premenopausal and feeling great without hot flashes or any other menopausal side effects, BUT, since I have a family hx, my onc felt it important that I take shots to \"shut down\" my hormones, like an artifical menopause. I did not have chemo because my recurrance risk was very low, but instead went the anti-hormone route, since as you know hormone positive breast cancer cells, feed on hormones. Anyway, hopefully, you can find the br ca site I go to. - but stay on this one as well, if you can. - I have learned alot on here as well and talked with many wonderful ladies. Leea",

Many women find alot of relief with effexor, which is an antidepressant but also works to minimize hot flashes. Some women are rxed gabapentin ( nuerontin) which can be used \"off label\" for hot flashes. Others try evening primrose. I myself have had alot of trouble with hot flashes, but they have settled down some in the past 6 mths. I tried nuerontin for a few mths but it made me feel weird and dizzy, so I just use natural remedies. this is what helps me some and other survivor's as well: -Avoid or limit caffeine, as this will make it worse. -Avoid or limit wine, \" \" \" \" \" \" -Wear layers and only natural fibers, like cotton. -Keep room air low and rooms well ventilated, so as to not get overheated. I do really well at about 72-73 degrees, but the minute a family member turns the AC above 73, I can feel it immediately. -Keep ice water next to your chair or bedside. -Use fans. -Exercise. - You will notice less hot flashes on days you exercise.

My aunt was dxed very late in life at age 80 and is now 90. I was dxed 2 yrs ago at age 48.- I have a very good prognosis and plan on living a long life, as well! We all had invasive infitrating or it is usually called, invasive ductal carcinoma.(IDC) One thing I would advise with a family hx such as yours, is to follow-up with a good breast cancer or breast health center where you and your sister can get specialized screening including ultrasounds and MRIs, so that if heaven forbid, you develop it, it WILL be caught early. - EVEN if you have to drive an hr or two to get to a good breast center, IT IS WORTH IT. As far as helping your mom, a friend of mine did alot of \"checking in with me\", via phone. She was always ready to listen to me vent about treatment or my fears ect. She also sent \"care packages\" now and then to keep my spirits up. Both these things ment alot to me. I did not have chemo, but know many that did. If your mom has chemo, other's have told me just helping with meals, keeping the fridge stocked and helping with cleaning and laundry is great. She may have \"taste changes\" with chemo and only certain foods may taste good.- Get her whatever food she likes. Best wishes to you and your family. Leea",

When I did the bilateral mast initially, it took a week to get my range of motion and then maybe a couple of more wks for my arms to feel pretty much back to normal. They will give you exercises, like having you walk your fingers up the side of a wall to help with this, after you heal. But the 1st wk after surgery, they will advise to not raise your arms too much. For example, I had to have someone help me get thing's out of the cupboard, because it was too high to reach. When I did my reconstruction, 9mths later, I had no problems at all with range of motion. Best of luck for a good surgery and speedy recovery. Leea",

I remember, I would not lay on my stomach, as I was afraid, by \"squishing\" the breast, I might cause it to spread. - I couldn't get to surgery soon enough. It is hard to tell your children. I waited about a week because they were just getting done with the school year (late May of 06). They were 15 and 9 at the time. - Both boys. I told them separately because of the age difference. My 9yr old is the \"emotional one\". He cried many times and asked if I was going to die. I told him, No. - that they had caught it early. He is doing better know, since it has been almost 2yrs. My 15 yr old has 2 good friend's whose moms both had breast cancer and are doing well. He said, \"Mom lots of people get breast cancer but hardly anyone dies from it.\" So I think he kind of took it in stride. Good luck with telling your children. I hope you may still be able to visit your daughter, late April. Depending on your treatment, you might still be able to go. - I had bilateral mast, June 8th of 06 and was down in Florida for a family vacation by July 4th. Keep us posted. Leea",

Anyway, since you are at high risk for recurrance, I don't know if I would want to risk it. It is good your vit D is in normal range. These are the things I learned from visiting another br ca site re bone loss: -Are you able to exercise? Any weight bearing exercise including walking is good. I have read some get very good results with wt training 2-3 times/wk. -Also, some oncs are recommending higher doses of vit D: -Vit D 2000mg/day. -Calcium 1500mg/day. -Magnesium (very important for bones) 500mg/day. For better absorption, it is supposed to be taken at a different time than the calcium. You could ask your doc. if these amounts are Ok to take. Also, I have read some Oncs. are rxing Evista which preserves bone and protects against breast cancer at the same time. (Kind of like tamox but with less SEs). Anyway, if you can I would really step up the exercise and see if upping your vitamins/minerals is OK with your doc. Leea",

Your onc will probably switch you to tamoxafin until they are sure you are menopausal. Also ask your Dr. for periodic tests of your hormone levels (estradiol). Some also test for FSH (Follicle Stimulating Hormone). Menopause is defined as no periods for 1 year, although I have heard of survivors whose periods come back after one year. That is why it is so important to test the hormones to ensure the person is truly menopausal before starting an AI. I am a 1.5yr survivor and just started Femara about 2 mths ago. Leea",

If your MIL is early stage with no lymph node involovement, she may be able to take the Oncotype dx test, which analyzes 21 genes of her particular tumor, to determine the chances of recurrance within 10 yrs on anti-hormone therapy only. I had the test done and my score came back a low #10, which suggested that I had a 93% chance of NO recurrance in 10 yrs with anti-hormone thereapy alone. In my situation, chemo would have given very little benefit. This test, as well as statistics from adjuvantoline (which the oncologist can obtain for you) helped me to make my decision. The oncotype dx test is very well known in the breast cancer community and is a good tool to help make decisions regarding chemo. It might be worth it to research these tests and ask the oncologist's, on behalf of your MIL, if these tests/stats would be helpful in her situation. You could also get a 3rd opinion. It is always good if you can go to a major cancer center if possible for opinions, as they are usually up on the latest. Best wishes to your MIL. Leea",

Have they tested your hormones? Are you having any other symptoms like hot flashes? I have read that low hormones, such as in menopause, caused by chemo, tamox, or ovarian shut down like lupron/zolodex can make it much harder to lose wt or cause wt gain. I was 48, like you, when dxed 2.5yrs ago. Premenopausal. I did not have chemo but did have zolodex shot/tamox. Then I had ovary removal Feb. 08, which I regret. I have always been lean and fit/always exercised and eat pretty healthy. Since the ovary removal, especiallly, I have put on around 8ibs, it seems like, \"out of nowhere.\" (alot on a small frame). Also the flabby middle. My thyroid is fine. I exercise and wt train 6 days/wk, but realize without any hormones to help metabolism etc., I will need to really watch my diet to keep the wt gain at bay or hopefully loose wt. Anyway, I think it is totally normal that it would be harder to lose with changes to hormones. Sound's like you are making steady progress. - It just might take a little longer. Good luck. Leea",

Thus, stage 0 does not invade surrounding tissue and has 0% chance to spread. So for your particular diagnosis of stage 0 that you have now, there is NO risk of recurrance. - However, I believe anyone who has had DCIS is at some higher risk of invasive cancer in the future. I think whether to take tamox is a toss-up. It most likely would provide some benefit in lowering your risk of more DCIS or an invasive cancer, but the question is, \"Would the benefit outweigh the side effects and risks and by how much, percentage wise?\" ( some potentially serious like blood clots, stroke and in rare cases uterine cancer.) As one of the oncologist's said, if I were pre-menopausal I might consider it more seriously, as in premenopause there is so much more estrogen to fuel a potential breast cancer. Hope this helps.

Since you are BRCA+ they may be recommending an ooph, as BRCA1 and BRCA2 have a higher chance of developing ovarian cancer. Having an ooph is a very big and personal decision, as you loose all the benefits of your hormones including being able to have a child (Although I've heard of some women freezing their eggs, before they have an ooph). Anyway, you are asking very thoughtful, important questions. Your oncologist needs to explain fully the pros/cons of any treatment and a 2nd opinion may be helpful, as well. Best of luck, Leea",

      "Content": "Hi Marcine The Brca 1 and 2 ARE genes that indicate a person is at higher risk for breast and/or ovarian cancer. I tested negative for the brca genes but do have a family hx with my mom, maternal grandma and aunt. I developed early stage br cancer in May 2006 and am doing well. The counselor is right. Her2 is a protein that causes breast cancer cells to replicate faster. For this, hercepton is usually given and works well. It sounds like your mom was tested for her2 but most likely did NOT have the brca test. The brca test is a blood test and the her2 test is a test on the tumor, to see what features it has. The brca test is very expensive. Insurance usually pays for at least part of it. The reason I believe they would like to have your mom tested, is that if she is negative, it will indicate you donot have the gene either. - In other words, then you don't have to test too. Hope this helps. Leea",
