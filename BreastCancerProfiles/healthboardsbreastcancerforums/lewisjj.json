    "Content": "I also have had pain on the left nipple. This started about 3 months ago after completing anitibiotics for a sinus infection. I have fibroids on the uterus though they were diagnosed years back as benign. I am planning on going to get a mammogram once our new health insurance kicks in. I have been experiencing swelling and pain before my menstrual cycle and am not sure if any of this relates. I also have noticed Paget's disease seems to be coming up on my searches as well. I have small breasts yet my nipples have always been very so called pointy (not sure how to word that one). I'm curious as to what you have learned about your problems and if you have been able to get a cure. Thank you in advance. I'm 38 years old.",
