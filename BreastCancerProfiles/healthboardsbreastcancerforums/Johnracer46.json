      "Content": "Hi everyone, I'm the wife of John who's battling advanced prostate cancer. Last trip to MDAnderson I met a new comer to breast cancer who said her breast cancer wasn't hormone driven; but, instead triple negative. What does that mean? She is a spunky fighter and new friend. For anyone that has been through this form of breast cancer, what was your treatment direction? She's had surgery and began weekly chemo through a port. I appreciate your help in understanding my new friends situation. Take care all... Cancer Free....whatever it takes (Our Mantra) Linda",

That's where I met my new friend with the same breast cancer as you. I wanted to say thank you for explaining it. I wish for you the best as you continue to fight. God bless! Linda",
