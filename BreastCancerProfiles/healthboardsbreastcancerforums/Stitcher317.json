      "Content": "I haven't a clue about when you'll be finished with the drugs but do have a question for you. I just finished my radiation and one Oncologist tells me I should take Tamoxifen and another said not a big deal at my age (66) and Stage 0 cancer with no lymph node involvement. How old were you went to went on it and how did you feel on both drugs? I understand the side effects are quite unpleasant. Also, both my parents died of strokes and I still have a uterus, thus the concerns regarding the Tamoxifen. I do understand the ramifications of getting Br. Cancer back again but concerned about the potential life threatening side effects. Thanks for your time.",

      "Content": "Hello Leea, I have a few questions you may be able to help me with. I recently had a lumpectomy and SN biopsy which was negative. Dx'd with DCIS Stage O cancer. I have just started radiation but was not a candidate for the Mammosite procedure because my tumor margins while clear of any cancer cells did show some atypical hyperplasia. Thus, the whole breast radiation. I asked my radiology oncologist about the Oncotype tumor test and she said it was not performed on patients with Stage O cancer. Do you have any knowlege of this? I was eager to learn my recurrence potential. So far I have seen 2 medical oncologists. One wants me to take Tamoxifen to reduce my recurrence rate and the other said if she had DCIS Stage O cancer and was my age (66) she wouldn't bother...claiming most women feel pretty crummy on it. Looking for any input on this issue. Thanks....",

      "Content": "Thanks so much for your input, Leea. I am leaning toward not taking Tamoxifen primarily due to the potential side effects. While I have never had any issues with stroke or clots, I do have a very strong family history of it. Grandparents and parents both died of strokes. My radiation is going along smoothly although I have only completed 8 treatments so far. I am already feeling the fatigue! I am slowly cleaning up my diet and getting rid of the sweets I love so much. Hopefully this, along with diligent monitoring ,will serve me well in the future. Happy Holidays everyone",

      "Content": "I have just been DX'd with Papillary DCIS. My radiology oncologist has recommended either the \"Mammosite\" or \"SAVI\" accelerated breast radiation procedure which you get 2X daily for 5 days instead of the 6 week radiation. Naturally I've been reading up on this 24/7 and still haven't come to a decision I am comfortable with for either procedure. There are pros and cons to each therapy. This is relatively new but the 5 year results are in and are identical to the 5 year recurrence rates for the 6 week treatment with less side effects. Has anyone had this type of radiation? If so, would you share your experience with me? Thanks....",
