      "Content": "My bestfriend was diagnosed with stage 2b breast cancer in 2003 with four positive lymphnodes. Recently she has been having a lot of pain in her shoulders and a really bad case of sciatica. She went to the doctor and had some type of blood tests done and her levels were elevated and her doctor insisted she go get a bone scan. Sorry I don't have more information on the blood test she had. It's something she has done every six months since being diagnosed. She is extrememly worried (as am I) that the sciatica is bone mets. Has anyone here experienced anything like this? Thank you in advance.",

I think the fact that your wife's is sore to touch is a good sign actually. I'm going through something right now and it is scary. Tell not to worry too much though.",

      "Content": "I'm 45 years old and have been having routine mammograms for the past 10 years due to my mother's metastatic breast cancer death. Every year they have been fine. Well I had one this past Tuesday and the receptionist called and said they want to do a second mammo. She said my right breast had changed when compared to last year's mammo results. I asked if it was anything to worry about and she said there will be doctors I can talk to when I got to my second mammo. She said there was no lump or anything, just that the breast had changed. I have gained about 10 pounds in the last year. I now weigh 120 and am 5 feet 6 inches. I'm pretty sure the weight gain is due to pre-menopause. My breast have been tender frequently and have actually gotten a little bit bigger. I'm kind of nervous. Any words of wisdom from any of you fine ladies? Thanks in advance.",
