    "Content": "Hi, I'm 22 and last week, I don't know if I had scratched my boob but come Sunday, I suddenly felt that it started to hurt, turns out, there was this sudden wound on my nipple, that was that and then days later, little black spots that are also wounds, started to appear on my areola. I've tried sanitizing it with hydrogen peroxide and applying betadine afterwards but it's been almost a week and it's still here and the little black wounds are gaining in number, it's accumulating over my areola. Now,I am currently working in Diego Garcia which is an island in the middle of nowhere and there are no proper facilities for me to have this checked up, what the medical doctor gave me was MooreBrand's triple antibiotic ointment which I applied today, so far I've been feeling sudden but constant pains on my nipple, I don't know if it's the ointment doing it's healing powers or getting it worse. Again, I have about 1/4 of my whole nipple wounded and some tiny black wounds around my areola, I've made the mistake of googling it and I am now paranoid that I may be one of the unlucky people that have Paget's disease. Please someone help please please???",
