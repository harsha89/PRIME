    "Content": "Please help, I have just noticed 2 tiny spots on the bottom of my right breast about the size of a pea but not round that seem to be slightly indented. The spots are just areas of my skin that seem to be a bit indented and lighter than my normal skin. I just had a breast exam by my gyno in Jan 2004 and a mammo in Feb 2004. I have fibrocystic breast disease but other than that my mammo came back normal. I get them yearly. I have absolutely no other symptoms. I always do self breast exams and feel nothing. Anyone else out there like this? I think I will call my Doctor tomorrow for a check up. Waiting patiently, Karen",
