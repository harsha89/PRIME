    "Content": "Oh my god I'm going through the same thing! I just very recently had strep throat, sicker than a dog. I'm still on meds for it. I noticed one night in my sleep a swollen area under my armpit it hurt when I hit it rolling over in my sleep. I've been freaked out ever since!!! I also have mammo's every year my gyno check up is in a couple of month's. Should I up the appointment? Any advise would maybe calm me down. Thanks! Jen",
