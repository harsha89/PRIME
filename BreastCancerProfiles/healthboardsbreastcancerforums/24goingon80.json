    "Content": "It's highly unlikely to be breast cancer. The fact that you have a lump on both sides (correct?) is the defining aspect. It's also unusual (though not impossible) for a young male to get breast cancer. Of course, everyone on the website will tell you to see a doctor just to be on the safe side, so by all means, do that. If you don't want to see a doctor, just continue to monitor the lumps (though don't poke at them obsessively). I suspect it also could be lymph nodes that you're feeling. Sometimes they swell because you've recently fought an infection or something. On the other hand, the size you described (2.5 cm?) is a bit of a concern. I'd certainly recommend seeing a physician just to be on the safe side.",
