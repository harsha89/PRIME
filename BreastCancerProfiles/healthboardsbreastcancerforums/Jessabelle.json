    "Content": "hey im 23 years old and had a problem with my right breast for the last 2 years. It seems just to get worse. I was at a doc but he said, young girls don't get breast cancer. He told me i had lumpy breasts, but that would be normal. He didnt want to do any other tests and i cant go to another doc because im living overseas at a military base......... But the problem is that this breast is larger than the other one and it seems to grow larger. Im so scared, nobody wants to take me seriously. It hurts too, but the doc said it is a muscle. I dont know what to do, a year ago i got really bad right shoulder pain that went into my breast and all the doctors i went to said it was a muscle spasm. Now over a year later i still have pain in this shoulder that sometimes makes it hard for me to breathe. I dont even wanna go to the hospital anymore, they look at my like i m crazy. Im just so dissapointed, that nobody can help me and i'm still in pain. Maybe somebody here had a similiar experience and can tell me how breast cancer starts and if it really doesnt hurt - cause the doc said breast cancer doesnt hurt.......thats why i don't have it. But can he be so sure??? Thanks for any answers",
