    "Content": "I just had my annual exam with my ObGyn and he said he felt a lump in my left breast, so he had me go for a diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound. They both came back clear, but he still wants me to go have a biopsy. I cannot find the lump anywhere that he found. Has anybody had this situation before? I don't have family history of breast cancer, only ovarian. Can anybody give me their thoughts? Thanks, Jitterygal",
