    "Content": "It might have something to do with your lymph nodes. Around my period I always have a lot of pain there as well and in my groin area it is painful to the touch. One time one of the lymph nodes in my groin became very large so I saw my doctor and she said it could be from a problem in my leg but there was no visible problems there so she had me wait it out until my period was over and it went away. She said that sometimes you have changes in your lymph nodes due to hormones. And now that I am pregnant I have pain on both armpits and can actually feel the swollen nodes. The three places your lymph nodes are prominent is your groin,underarm and, neck. I would check those places for inflamation and raise the question to your doctor.",
