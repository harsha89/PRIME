      "Content": "Hi all. Just a brief rundown. About 9 years ago, my mother in law was diagnosed with breast cancer and had one breast removed. About 5 years ago it returned in the other breast and that breast was removed also. Lymph nodes were also taken. Last week she fell ill. The cancer is back. At first it was thought to be liver cancer (and nothign could be done). Further testing revealed it was breast cancer - but in her liver (she also has a small lump in her breast). I have never heard of breast cancer being anywhere other than the breast. I know that makes it easier to treat (and the type of chemo to be used is supposed to NOT make her sick - just bald). Has anyone ever heard of this? Is there any chance of remission? (I should mention that her liver isn't exactly strong due to years of wine consumption. She only stopped when she was forced to a week ago). Thanks in advance for any input.",
