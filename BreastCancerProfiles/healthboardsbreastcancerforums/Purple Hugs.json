      "Content": "Well, it's impossible to say... best thing to do.. you know already. Go have a chat with your GP...this week.. not next.. not in a fortnight.. just in case! You should be referred for a check - likely an ultrasound as you are young, and possibly a mamogram. neither of which are scary. But you will feel scared, insecure, worried etc.. this is all normal. Take your BF for support And thank him for noticing and commenting on it... no matter what the outcome it's better to know now! Good luck! And remember the majority of lumps (especially in younger women) are benign. ((Hugs))",

      "Content": "((hugs)) I haven't the same thing entirely, but do have the pulling and pain after a lumpectomy. I had my biopsy/lumpectomy in 2004, and have annual screening. I had fibroademous (still can't spell it). When I get cold.. or on off days I do get a very painful area around my scar and always assume this is due to the surgery. For a while after surgery id' have needle like sharp pains in my breast. occasionally i still get them. All we can do is have faith in our mamograms (and MRI for me this year.. for the first time).",

      "Content": "I'm so sorry you are going through this.. and know the turmoil of looking at all the possiblilities... I was given great advice of taking a 3rd party with you, and a notebook in with me, with words and diagnosis in there so that i have a page to flip to given the diagnosis.. then you can have questions ready for each scenario... this way.. you have the questions ready to hand.. and if your brain screams at you, you just have to pass it to the consultant or perhaps ask the questions if you can. You an write down the answers too. ((Hugs)) Thankfully my smooth lump was benign but i had it removed just in case. I felt a bit silly about this, till a nurse chatted with me and said that if it was her... she'd do the same as she'd seen 'benign' biopsies belong to malignant lumps. I don't want to scare you.. this is just the opinion of a nurse i met. As for your stomach pain and nausea.. speak to your Dr/consultant, NOW.. just to get it checked.. could be totally unrelated.. but if not they really really need to know NOW. Wish you good results! I know how hard things are for you at the moment having been there myself. ((hugs))",
