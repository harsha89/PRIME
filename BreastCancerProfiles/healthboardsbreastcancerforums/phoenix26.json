    "Content": "Hi, I'm new to this, but i'm having pains in my right breast, about 1.5 inches to the right of my nipple, its very sore but there is no lump that i can feel, they are throbbing pains which are quite sore. Its been going on for about 2 days and this morning while in work i got a similar pain in my left breast, roughly in the same spot. i'm not pregnant as i have starrted my period and have the implanon. i was being treated for agressive CIN3 and am waiting results from hospital as to whether they got it all or not. can anybody help explain what is going on? these pains are really getting sore.",
