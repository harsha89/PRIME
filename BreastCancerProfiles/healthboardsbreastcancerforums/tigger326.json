    "Content": "I went for a mammogram today. I had found a lump in my right breast located close to where I had fatty lumps removed 6 years ago. The surgeon had told me then I would find more lumps... Well, my ob/gyn and I decided on a mammogram since I hadn't had one in so long. I went this morning and after I was done with round one, the radiologist asked for more films. Then he wanted an ultrasound. I still wasn't overly worried until the ultrasound tech examined a totally DIFFERENT area of my breast and did so for a long time. Then she asked where I had found a lump and checked there. Now I am scared. No results for 48 hours. Please pray for me.",
