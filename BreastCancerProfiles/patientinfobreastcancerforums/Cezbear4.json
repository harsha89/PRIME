      "Content": "Hi Cezbear! I would make an appointment with your primary care clinician to have an exam. Many irregularities are actually normal variations of anatomy. That being said, you never know for certain. I am a Nurse Practitioner in the States and performed countless breast exams. One thing is certain, you need to be examined by a professional. They can do an X-ray if they are concerned about the structure, contour, or shape of the breast bone. Please let me know what they find. I shall be thinking of you!

      "Content": "So I\u2019m new here so I don\u2019t know if this is the right place to post this, but I\u2019m hoping for answers. I have a lump on my left brestbone, it doesn\u2019t stick out of my skin, but it defiantly makes my left side of my chest look more raised. It feels hard like it could be bone, it\u2019s irregular in shape and it\u2019s not moveable. I\u2019m only 18 so I\u2019m worried? In your experience does this sound worrying? Thanks for all the advice x 1 like, 1 reply Report 1",
