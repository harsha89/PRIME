      "Content": "Hi, Firstly l hope your friends Masctecomy goes as well as possible!  I had a mastectomy 6 years ago, but mine was before chemo and radiotherapy. They seldom save the nipple, as there may be cancer cells there! I had no problems with my mastectomy, l had already had a lumpectomy and node removal 4 weeks previous, so it was 'just' a matter or taking the breast off. Due to my 'not so good diagnosis' l decided against a reconstruction.  But after a year l couldn't get on with the prosthesis, so went for a diep, where they take the fat from your stomach and make a breast, unfortunately a few do fail, my was done by using the blood vessels, l was 'lucky' l had a nipple made a coupld of months later, where they pinch a bit of skin and stitch it.  A month or so later l had the tattoo, this was done twice, but probably needs doing again, but l am too old to worry!!  some just have the 3D tattoo, l have seen this and was very impressed. I had no trouble with the nipple l was awake when they did it, a 10 minute job! There are facebook Breast cancer group, one of which l am admin.  A 'must'  is Breast Cancer Care, they have a truly amazing forum. They also have a breast care nurse online so your friend can speak to someone about her concerns.  Hope it goes well for her. Report Thank you VERYmuch for sharing your story. You are very brave and I admire you. I will pass along this very helpful information. Thank you again ! Report Unfortunately there is no 'brave' in cancer, you either have the treatment, or.....well the other option doesn't bear thinking about. Hope you friend gets all the answers she needs. Report",

So please try not to stress too much, lots of very good treatment out there 'if' it is breast cancer. Are you going to a one stop breast clinic, where you get the results the same day?  If not please ask if you have one at your hospital/clinic. A friend of mine has lupus she also has breast cancer,mi have never heard her say she was more susceptible than I was, but perhaps the conversation never came up!  A very good helpline for you. Google, Breast Cancer  Care helpline, they have a forum, but most importantly they have a breast cancer nurse that you can speak to on the phone. She will hopefully put your mind at rest until your results are through. hope all goes well for you on Wednesday. If the results are positive, I am admin for a very good breast cancer group on Facebook, you will find the information and support invaluable. But that is jumping ahead. Until now speak to the breast cancer nurse at BCC. you can send me a pm if you want to talk privately, but until you have the results I am sorry to say the 'waiting room' isn't a nice place to be. hope Wednesday goes as well as it can.

The good thing is, if it is cancer it will have been picked up early if you have no symptoms. i too was recalled on a mammogram, unfortunately mine was breast cancer, but that was 6 years ago, and considering it had spread to most of my lymph nodes, I am doing really well.  I assume they have given you another appointment, hopefully it will be next week, they do try and fit us in early so we can get the results.  Of course it may not be cancer, I think I remember them saying when I had a call back, only 1 in 7 are found to have cancer. sally there is a helpline you can call, not sure of the hours, but if you google breast cancer care, there is a very good helpline. But as I say, until you have been checked again, no one can say yes or no. But they may be able to help with general questions.  They also have a forum, which is very good hope the waiting isn't too long for you.    Report Do you know if the same standard letter is given to those who have something suspicious in their scan and those retesting due to a technical problem? I had mine done by a trainee but surely if they were saying you need a retest due to a technical problem they should say that and not give you the ambiguity that causes so much anxiety? Of course a technical problem means I'm back to square one - \"unknown\" but that is a lot less stressful than a weekend of wondering if something is seriously wrong. In this day and age why are they not capable of tailoring their communications more. I have no obvious signs even after re-examining myself again and again.  Report Sally, I would say if the results were due to a technical problem which was caused by an inexperienced trainee, they may not know at this point that the trainee caused the problem. They just see something that doesn't look \"normal\" and have the \"better to be safe than sorry\" mentality. You would think they could tailor the letter if they knew for sure, (it would certainly be the more considerate thing to do) but who knows. I just hate that you're having to wait it out. ??? Report Sally I Would think a standard letter would be sent. sorry I can't see all your message, but you said a trainee technician, so I assume they told you that?

Just feels like I'm on my last weekend of bail before the jury returns to give their verdict. Situation worse as I have no adult shoulder to lean on. Hubby back 10pm tonight. At least having the entire weekend's domestic responsibilities all on myself, I have kept busy. That and watching my son play Rugby in the freezing cold and my usual trip to my mum who is now bed ridden with Alzheimer's. I had a full abdominal hysterectomy 2 years ago. Not cancer, benign fibroids but so large I had a 6 hour operation. My body now feels so good compared to then. I kept my ovaries though so feel good. I have everything crossed. Report I hope you get good results tomorrow Sally. Best wishes x Report Hi Sandra. Had my recall appointment and yes some small cysts were showing in my right breast. I had another mammogram and an ultrasound scan. Happily the consultant concluded that there was nothing causing concern and that the cysts would probably disappear post menopause. They were being super cautious due to this being my first screening and first benchmark. This was a happy outcome but a very anxious wait. I hope this may reassure others and it shows the uk screening programme is being very thorough Andy we should be thankful for that. Thanks for all your reassurance.  Report Great news!! Report So very pleased for you Sally, the news couldn't be better. I hope it puts ladies who get a recall minds at rest, and yes 'caution' is always very assuring.  We in the UK are extremely lucky with our NHS.

There maybe other symptoms, so any changes please get them checked.  Mine couldn't be felt and wasn't a lump, no symptoms, just shown on my mammogram, spread enough to be in most of my lymph nodes. mammograms appointments should never be missed.

Make  an appointment with your gp, then hopefully he will put your mind at rest or if he is concerned, will make an appointment for you to see a breast cancer specialist. if in doubt, check it out, breast cancer does NOT go away without treatment.
