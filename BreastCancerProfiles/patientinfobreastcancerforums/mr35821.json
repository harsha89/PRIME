      "Content": "Hi Mr. Usually, a patient has a mastectomy, radiation, then after the tissue has healed after radiation, starts herceptin plus other chemotherapeutic agents that would be effective against her specific tumor type. The medical oncologist receives specific information about the tumor type, markers, and grade. He is the one to speak to regarding your mother, plus include your mother in the discussion. I am conjecturing that your mother's breast mass was large, and they chose to treat it with herceptin prior to surgery. Has it metastasized beyond the lymph nodes, and if so, where? Did her body respond to the chemotherapy with herceptin the first time? How is she physically? Remember, all chemotherapy is poison or toxic to your mother, and the oncologist is weighing all these factors in the decision. I am so sorry your mother has breast cancer. My identical twin and I both have it. Please let me know what happens with your mom. Best Wishes Merry Juliana Report",
