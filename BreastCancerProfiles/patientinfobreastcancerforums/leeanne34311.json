      "Content": "Hi Leanne, I am a Nurse Practitioner in the States who used to work in women's health, ie evaluate women for breast cancer. I also have guttate psoriasis, a history of breast cancer-IDC, and was worked up for Paget's Disease. You didn't tell me if you have a family history of breast cancer, history of breast feeding, and your age. You need to be evaluated by a knowledgeable breast surgeon from a University Medical Center, immediately. Call for an appointment Monday, please. Do not go to the Planned Parenthood or local hospital breast surgeon for this. Do you have any masses when you perform a self breast exam? Do you have any enlarged axillary (armpit) lymph nodes? The reason I ask is Paget's Disease is associated with Intraductal Carcinoma, in which you might feel a breast mass. When you have Paget's Disease, as you know, it is usually one-sided. As you have had chronic Psoriasis, I am hoping it is Psoriasis. However, the breast needs to be evaluated by an excellent breast surgeon, pronto. You will feel relief when you take action steps towards a diagnosis. FYI, Oddly enough, when I was diagnosed with breast cancer three years ago, I had no fear. I hope I have helped you. Warm hugs to you. Merry Juliana Report Reply",

      "Content": "Breasts & anxiety can't shake it been suffering in silent for 2 weeks. Not sure how best to explain this but here goes. I have had inverted nipples which is normal for me but they would come out now & again - I also suffer with Guttate psoriasis which are small lesions like small round patches mostly around torso and back of my legs & breasts. I keep reading about pagits & I'm freaking out! I have no lump but my nipple that is inverted seems to be more swollen as usual and I have a small patch of dry red skin around/next to nipple. Please if anyone knows of any thing or can offer some advise I would really appreciate your help. Xxx . 1 like, 1 reply Report 1",
