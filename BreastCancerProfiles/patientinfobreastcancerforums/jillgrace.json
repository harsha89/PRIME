    "Content": "Please don't worry.  When it first happened to me I felt so afraid and alone - the pamphlet said that 4 out of 100 women are recalled but  I am sure that figure is much, much higher.   I know of lots of women who have been recalled for loads of  different reasons - please bear in mind that there are so many things that mammograms pick up, the vast majority of which are nothing sinister.
