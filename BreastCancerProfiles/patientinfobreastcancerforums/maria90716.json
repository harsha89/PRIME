      "Content": "I was diagnosed with left breast ductal carcinoma h2+ poorly diferintiated in October 2013, had a lumpectomy 12/2/13 started chemo in 2/14 and done with all of my infusions 5/15 almost two years a survivor Don't overwhelm yourself, I read all of my papers, did my own research, and asked many questions, know your body, and have faith, it can be scary and it's normal, one thing I do recommend is to try drinking fluids constantly, it was hard for me due to the vomiting, just slowly but constant, have crackers, I was given zofran for nausea but was not good for me, then got compazine which helped better, but ativan also halped me for the anxiety and even made a difference but just ask your doctor. Met patients who also told me to drink guanavana juice, that it helped with all the side effects, but again always ask your physician first. I know you will be okay, don't lose your sense of humor and smile this always helps... Report",
