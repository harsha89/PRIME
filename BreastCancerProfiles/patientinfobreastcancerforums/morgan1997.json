      "Content": "best thing is to get breast usg done asap. I also got same issue, burning sensation so much so that it even hurt when I use to take shower. got my usg done and it was fibromyalgia and costochondritis. doc gave me evening primrose to take. and within 2 days my symptoms eased off. so don't worry and get yr thorough check up. ur too young to worry abt having BC. don't worry it could be hormonal. keep us posted it after yr usg or any further tests Report Reply",

      "Content": "Some background info, last june i started getting sever itching on my right nipple. ive had exzema my whole life so i thought it must be that. i treated it with my topical steroid cream but it didnt help at all. i was reluctant to go to the doctor until about last month the itching became horrible. on top of that my nipple started to hurt, it feels like a burning stinging pain deep inside of my breast, it got so bad that it even wakes me up at night. i finally went to my doctor yesterday and theyre sending me to a breast soecialist for an ultrasound and mammogram. im just so nervous and dont have people to talk to who will understand. i attached two photos, the first of my normal nipple and the second of the one causing me problems. i think something is compeltely wrong and i dont think its as simple as exzema anymore 0 likes, 2 replies Report",
