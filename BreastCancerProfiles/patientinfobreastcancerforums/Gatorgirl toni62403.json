    "Content": "Hi Toni. I think the dr will pick up on the dimpling. My question is why wouldn't your mom want to mention it to them? If she's afraid of what it could mean, she needs to get into the mindset of doing what's best for herself and early detection is key! It may be nothing, but she needs to be her own best advocate when it comes to her health. I think if it were me, I would ask the doctor if I could sit in with them during the exam or at least ask them if there would be an opportunity for you to ask them some questions afterwards. That way, if it wasn't mentioned by her or them, then you'll be able to speak up. It's hard not to worry, I know. But be strong for your mom...hopefully everything will turn out fine. Best of luck!
