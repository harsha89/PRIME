      "Content": "Hi. I was recalled after my first routine mammogram and like you underwent all the follow up tests and was then given the devastating news that it was cancer. It felt like the bottom had fallen out of my world but one year on I have had a lumpectomy, 3 weeks of radiotherapy and I am now on Tamoxifen. I went back to work in January, I feel healthy and in so many ways life has gone back to normal.  Mentally though it it has been a roller coaster!!! The anger, fear and tears you will be experiencing are quite normal! I found that it was better not to bottle it up and I had a good cry if I felt like it. I was lucky in that a close friend had gone through a similar experience a couple of years earlier so I found it a great help to talk to her as she was able to offer the sort of advice you cannot read about in all the endless leaflets you will be given. I also built up a good relationship with my breast nurse who was able to offer lots of advice.....hopefully you will find someone you can talk to and that will help. Please try to stay positive and try to talk things through with friends, family or health professionals. I tried to keep as busy as I could as I was determined that having cancer would not take over my life.  Good luck and best wishes for the future.x Report 2 Thank you for the words of support. I have kept to myself today trying to not cry every time i think of this horrible thing. I will know when i'm having the lumpectomy probably on monday then thats the next step to deal with. I really appreciate the support of women who know. I live alone but have a few close friends and a son and daughter locally who are all shocked but will do what they can. Things is tho that they don't understand this horrible fear, fear of all thats to come...thank you and stay well. Blue :-( x   Report",

      "Content": "Hi. I started on Tamoxifen (following surgery and radiotherapy) last October. I am having hot flushes. They are not too bad although as they occur mainly at night it can disrupt sleep. My oncologist suggested auricular acupuncture which I am trying and so far I think it is helping. As the Tamoxifen is meant to help stop further tumours I feel it is worth trying to put up with the flushes but it is a personal choice. Good luck! Report Thanks for your reply. Glad to hear from someone who is getting on ok with the tablets.  I have heard some negative comments about people who have stopped taking the tablets. I'm hoping I get on with them especially as it will decrease the chance of a recurrence. Report",
