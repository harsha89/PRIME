      "Content": "Its not the best thing in the world, but its purpose is the best thing in the world.  If tumours are detected early they can be dealt with quite easily.  Why wait until its too late. Report 1 The \"purpose\" is only relevant if the actual facts support it. But that isn't the case because the mantra of \"early detection=saving lives\" through mammography hasn't resulted in a notable reduction of breast cancer mortality but instead it has led to a situation where the test causes more harm than good to most women (sources: Mammography Screening: Truth, Lies and Controversy by Peter Gotzsche and The Mammogram Myth by Rolf Hefti). Because the majority of women only have awareness\" of the pro-mammogram messages disseminated by the big medical business (with most mammogram-favorable \"studies\" sponsored by them) few know what the real facts are. Example, very few women understand or know the fact that a lot of breast cancer \"survivors\" are victims of harm instead of receivers of benefit.   Report 1 Well if not for my mammogram having found two tumours then maybe I may not be here. They have saved lives, and all for it. The benefit for me was life. This is my opinion and proud yo support mammograms. Report I tend to agree just having found a breast dimple myself in January 2014 which led to chemotherapy, surgery and radiotherapy I don't know whether attendance for a mammography would have found the tumour more quickly or not.  And of course there are now the follow up mammographies which I feel I cannot decline. Prior to this episode I did not attend for mammography because I found the procedure hell.  If I decide to go, I will be taking the advice of Karen007 and take painkillers beforehand. Report Well done Pat for speaking up about the harms of mammograms. So many women walk into these screening tests without finding out anything about them, and just blindly follow all the propaganda. Readers may also like to search on Michael Baum's name, who has also provided much balanced information on the subject, and also the organsation Sense about Science. Do please find out all you can before going for a mammogram. They are entirely optional, and there is a real risk of getting harmful treatment for finding something quite harmless on the mammogram. Report Thank you for your fabulous post that may deter women from having this useful service. Had I not gone for a mammogram, my 'c' (still can't bring myself to say the word) would still be undetected as it was not palpable. Because of this I am now having life saving surgery on Thursday. I do hope no-one takes notice of your post as it is most DEFINATELY a life saver both to myself and my mum who is a 10 year clear survivor with many thanks to the mammogram. I can't explain how furious I am at the negativity for something SAVING MY LIFE! Report The literature I received here in Scotland prior to my breast screening clearly stated the pros and cons of breast screening. I understood that I may end up receiving treatment for a cancer that may have gone undetected and never bothered me. I clearly understood this when welcoming the mammogram (due to a family history). Why do you say the majority of women only have awareness of the pro-mammogram messages? Is this literature not disseminated throughout the UK? So some people may have surgery or treatment when they might not have needed it, a shame but not the end of the world - however, what about those women who definately did need treatment and only found out via a mammogram? You state that the test 'causes more harm than good to most women'. What do you mean by that? That for every 1 person whose life is saved, two may have uneccessary treatment such as a biopsy or radiation etc? If so I would gladly be one of those who may have 'unnecessary' treatment should it save someone else's life.   Report I got a leaflet that clearly set out the pros and cons including unecessary treatment and worry. I live in England near London to be more precise Report I went for my 1st screening today, was umming and amming about it as have read stuff about it.  I think we just have to all go for it.  What Pat was saying is actually correct, its the same with cervical screening you can get false positives etc etc. meaning that roughly 17 out of a 1000 women will have surgery/treatment for something that may have never turned into anything.  I understand that the ering on the side of caution r is better then and potential cancer being left to its own devices which is why i went today.

      "Content": "Hi Christine, My oncologist doesn't seem to think aches and stiffness are due to the Letrozole, but more likely to be the ongoing after effects of the chemotherapy.  I too have gone down the same route as you (chemotherapy, surgery, radiotherapy which is ongoing and Letrozole for the next ten years - at least they're optimistic).  I am taking Tramadol Hydrochloride 50 mg for the pain along with an antiflamatory more to do with my osteo arthritic hip though, but it helps with the other things too.  Nowt much to growing old, eh?

Report Poor you, of course if he gives me any advise to help I will pass it on to you.  I only have osteoarthritis in my neck, but this muscle ache is everywhere, legs toes, arms, and I feel like I'm ageing rapidly.  Report",

      "Content": "This is very useful info Christine.  I too wake in the morning feeling 90.  I do stretching while in bed to lessen the effect of actually standing when I get out of it.  As in your experience, my stiffness, aches and pains do ease as I get moving, but it is difficult at first.  I am still taking pain killers to help ease things.  I agree that Letrozole is to blame having asked around other patients and professionals.  Added complication with me is that I have a severe arthritic hip and am now having to decide whether or not to go for a new hip op or to live with it.    Report",

      "Content": "Kelly, you are paranoid about it.  You have seen and spoken to so many professionals there must come a time when you trust them and relieve yourself of all this anxiety.  Its the anxiety that's making your life a misery think more positively; save all that anxiety for when there is something to be anxious about.  Try pilates for relaxation and a good walk to put roses in your cheeks.  And think about your little boy and have loads of fun with him.  Prioritise. Report Hi Poorly Person ( I do hope you are ok going off your name)  I really, completely understand what you are saying and believe me i have this fight with myself all the time. It's draining. I try to think positively, i think right... They have been checked a few times, i've had my bloods done, i've had chest xrays (although a chest xray wouldn't show BC) i calm myself down... Then after a matter of minutes the thoughts are back. What if it is BC, what if something has been missed, If i don't get it checked again or properly, then i could be dead in 6 months. That thought process takes over... and well... here i am. I'll mention it to my doctor again on Friday. If i'm persistant enough she might refer me. Thank you for your comment, i will try some of your suggestions too :-) xx Report",
