      "Content": "Hi June,  It seems my last post was deleted because of an external link which rather annoys me since it was a post to help but, I'll try this again. There's been several reports of people experiencing these same issues as you and if you do an internet search for \"letrozole causing gas and bloating\" there's a wide array of other people that are experiencing this and seem to have some valuable advice for helping with this.  Fennel seeds can be very helpful for this. Chewing on a teaspoonful can help. I do hope you find relief ^  Emis Moderator comment: I have removed the website details as they were to a site unsuitable for inclusion in the forums.

I am grateful to know that I am not the only one with this problem. I will certainly try all of your suggestions. Report",
