      "Content": "I have been for tests just before Xmas and they said it was infection. I have been back to gp in last couple of days and have to go back. I have chose a different hospital this time. Just so it's a different pair of eyes. I'm not a person who worries so I'm ok just think they have either missed something or if it is infection I need treating for it as its not going away and is painful. Report",

      "Content": "About 3 month ago I realized a change in left breast. Dimple in skin and had a little discharge from both breasts. Also both but more so left breast were very sore. Went to doctors, week of antibiotics, went back not much better but discharge had stopped. Doctor sent me to hospital and had mammogram and ultrasound scan and finally consultant said it was a infection. He said I was younger enough to fight it myself and no other action needed. I'm 39 years old. Any way about a month ago, about a month after hospital tests I realised its changes, just left side. Under my nipple feels like there's a hard tube like lump. Also nipple is been pulled in over. Sore than it was and often feels heavy. So went back to doctors. Different doctor, she said well u have had all the tests done but seen as its different to the first time may need tests done again. Didn't know what else to do with me. She was concerned about nipple been pulled inwards and also could fell tube like lump. Anyone had any similar problems or any advice? Feel ridiculous going back to hospital, but have opted for different hospital from last time Nicolax 1 like, 8 replies Report 1",
