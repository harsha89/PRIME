      "Content": "Hi falco, No doubt your both in turmoil right now. Try not to worry too much. They will do a biopsies and the samples will be sent off. Mammogram will show up exact situation of the cancer and they will show you what it looks like.They will talk you through everything you need to know. Not sure if you will see specialist same day or not. I Saw mine one week later when all the results were in. It depends on how your NHS works. I found the staff were great, very caring. When you see the specialist you will get all the info you need. And then they will go through treatment. I was unlucky to have 2 x 3cm tumours and both heading for each other which would make it a 10 cm tumour or more when they reached each other. My treatment was mastectomy and reconstruction. I would imagine chemotherapy would be offered to your wife. But the bright side of this is that caught early then they can sort it all. Where I live we have a place called MAGGIE'S, they are brilliant look them up on line. Also you can ring McMillan s, believe between 9 - 8pm. I have used both of these are was given so much help and info. O800 no. for Macmillan sorry do not have the rest but easily found on line. If anything can help you with let me know. Report thanks for your insight, not determined yet if it is cancer so lets hope for the best! I am from Toronto Canada. Report Sorry if jumped to wrong conclusion. From UK so do not know How things are done in Toronto. As far as I know McMillan 's. are also in Canada. But you would have some organisation with which you can get in touch with. Fingers crossed things go well for your wife. Report thanks for the kind words, lets pray and hope for the best! Report Hi Janet and others, results were not good, malignant tumor. She is having a lumpectomy followed by 3-5 weeks of radiation on March 6th. If lymph nodes are involved then she will need chemo. Lets pray and hope for the best! I went through surgery and chemo 7 years ago for stage 3 colon cancer so I know what my wife is going through! Report So very sorry to hear that, how big was the Tumor? Did they say. This is a tough time for both of you. Will be thinking of you both. Until you get biopsy results it's a waiting game. Do let us know how you get on. Report She is going through menepause so her cycle is all screwed up, getting period every 2 weeks with painful boobs which is normal. Then in January she didnt get period for a month but during that time one breast was hurting her. She checked it and noticed a lump. On Feb 4th she had an ultrasound which showed a 2cm mass. I paid and booked our trip to Florida leaving Feb 10. On Feb 6th she gets a call from her doctor not the secretary asking my wife to have a fast track mammo and biopsy on same day, it was scheduled for Feb 12 so I moved our departure to 6 Feb 16. On Feb 17 in Florida my wife called the hospital that morning and scheduled an appointment for Feb 26th the day we would be back. They had told us that it would take 7 days for results and would not say anything when they called us. Late afternoon she gets a call from the hospital from another intern asking her to see her ASAP. My with told her we were not in Toronto and an appointment was booked for the 26th, she said that was too late! But we are in Florida my wife told her, I guess she thought about it and said, \"ok Mrs. Schieda you enjoy the rest of your stay and we'll see you when you get back!\" So we staid until 26th, obviously we had an idea of what the results were going to be! But we stuck it out for the 9 days in Florida as best as we could. We got back and you know the rest...malignant 2cm tumor...surgery this Friday and radiation to follow...hoping NO CHEMO!!! Report",
