      "Content": "Hi, I found a lump on my breast 8 weeks ago and was referred to the breast clinic last week where I had a mammogram, ultrasound and biopsy taken. I went back today and they told me I had fibromatosis which is a benign breast tumour. I have to have a operation to remove the tumour but have been told that its extremely rare and that they don't know how to treat it until they have removed it and do another biopsy. Has anyone else had this? Been reading on the internet (I know I shouldn't!) and it says in some cases you need reconstruction, chemo and radio. There just seems to be very little to refer to.   0 likes, 9 replies Report",

      "Content": "Lin, That sounds awful. My doctor has been very hands up and said he's never dealt with fibromatosis before but he's said that I'll be monitored quickly for life. He said as I was young (34) he would try and minimise scarring so he went up through the nipple. I'm also very large chested which complicated things as as they have had to remove a fair bit I'm a bit hollow now so need to wait for the swelling to settle down to see if I possibly need any reconstruction work. I'm healing well but just worried that it's going to come back as think that's where the problems will start. Think I will mention to him about that paper although doctors do hate being told don't they!  Report",

      "Content": "Hi Lin, Thanks so much for replying, there really isn't anything on the web at all and think my surgeon is a bit perplexed. I had surgery to remove my tumour on Friday, all went well although in the space of 3 weeks my lump had doubled in size to over 4cm so was growing really fast. He seems confident that they have got rid but I know from seeing some articles on the web it has a high risk of coming back. Did yours come back after the initial surgery and in what time frame? Such scary stuff isn't it?  Report",
