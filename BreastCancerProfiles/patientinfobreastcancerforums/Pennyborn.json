      "Content": "Hi Penny, \"Hypoechoic\" can be a characteristic of a solid tumor, either benign or malignant. The size of over one centimeter concerns me. They do not mention any visualization of calcifications or spiculations, which is great, as they are indicative of malignancy. The macrolobulation supposedly is more indicative of a benign tumor than microlobulations, but I prefer to see smooth margins on imaging reports. Have you noticed any increased vascularity (blood vessels) to that one breast? Have you had a mammogram 3D computererized, as well? May I ask your age? Frankly, the radiologist has no way of knowing if a 6 month delay in treatment would affect your treatment. I think he is wrong. I am a Nurse Practitioner in the States who was diagnosed with Invasive Ductal Carcinoma three years ago, had a partial mastectomy, radiation, and am on EXEMESTANE. I used to perform a \"breast clinic.\" When in doubt, I would order a biopsy of the breast mass. The radiologists would be perturbed, as I didn't agree with their findings to wait 6 months. I performed the breast exam, I read the history, I had cared for too many women as they died from breast cancer. When biopsied, a few women had breast cancer. That is the only way to know. I am going to private message you. Best Wishes Merry Juliana Report",

      "Content": "I went for my yearly in January. All was good. March came around and I found a hard lump. I moved so I needed to find a new doctor where I am now. I found a doctor. He felt the lump as well. Ordered an ultrasound. Gave me a few scenarios and said he was concerned it did not go away after my menstrual cycles. My grandmother passed away from breast cancer and my mom has had issues and scares throughout the years. I had a lump a long time ago that was very painful and saw a breast specialist due to family history. This new lump is not painful. I went for the ultrasound and was told that it is not a cyst and is a solid mass. The technician said she wouldn\u2019t lose sleep over it and come back in 6 months. The radiologist came in and told me the same. Also told me that if I came back and anthign changed and it turned out to be cancerous my prognosis and treatment wouldn\u2019t be affected. Didn\u2019t really make me feel good. I later had no follow up from my doctor and had to call in. When I called in a nurse said that my results were read to me by the radiologist and to go off what they said. I had to look online to get the test results which read: There is a 1.9 x 0.8 x 1.4 cm oval hypoechoic nodule with macrolobulated margins at 5 oclock, 5 cm from nipple, which corresponds to a firm mobile marble-sized nodule on exam. birad3. Probably not cancer. I know I am fine but the follow up was terrible and doesn\u2019t sit well with me. Any insight?  0 likes, 1 reply Report",
