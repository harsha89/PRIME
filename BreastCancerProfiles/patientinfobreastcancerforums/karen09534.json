      "Content": "Hi I am recovering from BC    My advice to you is see your GP for immediate advice/referral for tests. No one, not even a BC Consultant can diagnose anyone without mammogram/scan/biopsy.  The sooner you seek advice the sooner you will get peace of mind.  If it is cancer the sooner it is treated the better your survival   Good luck and see your GP as soon as possible  Report Reply",

      "Content": "Hi  I had a mastectomy and had part reconstruction may 2017. It takes about 6 months to fully complete reconstruction from having expander fitted during mastectomy operation to having the exchange with the implant. I can honestly say my whole experience was fine. I would also say that I lost my nipple due to type of cancer. I had lobular. Hope this helps. Good luck with your op.  Report",

      "Content": "Yes I was diagnosed in May   I had masectomy as they found 2 tumors which were too far apart to do lumpectomy.  Cancer did not spread to lymph nodes so did not need radiotherapy as it would not benefit me.  They did a further test which is only done in America  to see whether chemo would benefit me.  Thankfully I did not need chemo as my score was border line.  My treatment is therefore letrozole tablets for 5 years and also zoledronic acid which is given by infusion every 6 months.  This treatment is for 3 years.  I am currently undergoing reconstruction which will hopefully be complete later this year.    ?Please remember everyones treatment is unique to them.  So my advice to you is just to concentrate on yourself and listen to your Surgeon My experience tells me they know what they are doing.  If you need any further help please do not hesitate to contact me. ?Good luck.  Report",
