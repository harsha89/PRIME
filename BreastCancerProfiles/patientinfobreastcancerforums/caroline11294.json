      "Content": "Firstly, really sorry to hear what you are going through and wishing you very well. I found the the following letter in the research. Obviously he is writing doctor to doctor so the tone is upsetting (the science may think possible effects on singing are \"trivial\" but you would disagree!). They did huge trials on Tamoxifen and it seems effects on singing were not flagged up as a side effect. I think it's likely if it were a big effect on a lot of people they would have noticed. That said, this is so central to who you are, I'd discuss with your doctors what they think and ask if there are other treatments which are as good as Tamoxifen but carry no risk of affecting your voice. Very best of luck! caroline here's the letter:  Tamoxifen and the Singing Voice Andrew Herxheimer Citation: Herxheimer A (2005) Tamoxifen and the Singing Voice. PLoS Med 2(9): e310. doi:10.1371/journal.pmed.0020310 Published: September 27, 2005 Copyright: © 2005 Andrew Herxheimer.

Competing interests: The author has declared that no competing interests exist. My remark, in my recent Essay in PLoS Medicine [1], that deepening of the voice occurs with long-term use of tamoxifen for breast cancer needs qualification. Several colleagues have rightly pointed out that the evidence for the effect is less clear than I implied: it comes from women who have experienced it [2], but there have been no controlled studies. A change in voice was looked for and not found among effects spontaneously reported in large trials of tamoxifen, but this was not specifically asked about and might well have been missed. It is also recognised that the voice sometimes becomes deeper during or after menopause, in the absence of tamoxifen. To convey the uncertainty of the facts, I wish to amend my statement as follows: \u201cThe irreversible deepening of the voice that has been reported to occur with long-term use of tamoxifen for breast cancer is an example of a side effect that prescribers, manufacturers, and drug regulators seem to have considered trivial and have not investigated.\u201d Report",

      "Content": "Very best of luck! The first session of MLD made me feel a bit peculiar (like 10% of flu) and I'd wished I got someone to drive me home. I was peeing like a horse too for a couple of hours after!  The subsequent sessions were much easier though. I had health insurance and got my MLD practitioner through my consultant and the insurance paid so that was good. She said that she was training my lymph fluid to take new pathways, a bit like a road being closed and widening a back road to be a permanent diversion.... Report",

Re the MLD you need to quiz any practitioners about their training and qualifications  according to the lady who helped me - some people have only done a few weekends of training, Report Thanks, I'll ask around for an experienced MLD therapist.

      "Content": "Firstly I want to say how sorry I am and that I hope you are getting good medical care at such a worrying time, Everyone is different so your path may be different from me but I hope my story may reassure you. I had a similar diagnosis to you. After a radical mastectomy in June 2007 I was given chemotherapy (doses every 2 weeks July 2007-Oct 2007) and radiotherapy (Nov-Dec 2007). My tumour also tested positive for herceptin and oestrogen so I had herceptin Oct 2007-Oct 2008. I still take the aromatase inhibitor anastrozole which stops oestrogen production. I feel battered by the whole experience but I am still here (!). I got help on dealing with it all from both Macmillan counsellors and The Haven which also offers complimentary therapies like acupuncture, meditation etc. Since then Maggie's Centres have started to appear - I'd have used them if I could. Other thing I had was manual lymphatic drainage which completely cured the lymphodoema I started to get at one point. Wishing you well in all respects,  Caroline Report Thanks Caroline, I had good news; the cancer hadn't become invasive. No further treatment, check up in 6 months and yearly mammograms on the remaining breast. I do have oedema around the scar site and the area feels a bit uncomfortable but the surgeon said nothing to worry about. The manual lymphatic drainage sounds a good idea. Thanks for sharing your experience with me and I wish you all the best. Report",
