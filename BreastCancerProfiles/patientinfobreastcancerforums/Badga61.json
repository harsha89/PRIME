      "Content": "I am 56 and had my third regular breast screening mammogram today.  On the previous two occasions I had two scans per breast - on where the breast is squashed from top to bottom and one squashed side to side. \u200bToday the mammographer did an extra top to bottom one focusing on the nipple area of both breasts. \u200bIs this something new, or are my breasts now too pendulous to be able to get the nipple on in the normal top to bottom one?  My main concern is that she did this because she saw something abnormal.  Could this be the reason for doing it? 0 likes, 2 replies Report",
