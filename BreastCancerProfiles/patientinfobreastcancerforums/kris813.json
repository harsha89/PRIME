    "Content": "Hi Nicoletta6, Do you still have this issue.  I have the same thing under/in my left breast . Its like a fast vibration like a cell phone or maybe a twitching,  It happens to me every day all day long on and off.  It started about 2 or 3 month ago ..... Its kind of driving me crazy Report Reply what about night? do you feel it by night? mine went away for 2 monțhs but now it come back but i feel it more slowly than the first time. i have problems with my back and my doctor said to me that is possible to feel this because of my spine problems. i will have to take a MRI to see what is it. maybe herniated disc and because o that i may feel this strange thing. i hope we all be ok and find out what is it. so if you know that you have spine problems its ok to check it out. Happy holidays and all the best! Report Reply",
