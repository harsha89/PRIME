      "Content": "Hi there I had breast cancer 13 years ago it was diagnosed after my first mammogram I was 50 and for three months I was in a state of shock and didn't take it in at all I looked at various alternatives to surgery but in the end I decided to have a mastectomy and a restructure at the same time I spent 10 days in hospital and felt fine but as soon as I came home the realisation of the prognosis hit me and I felt extremely low and very vulnerable and found it it distressing like most women I have always been a strong person but this made me feel frightened and insecure but within three months I was back to my old self and returned to work I had looked at the holistic approach but the results were not always successful it's a gamble either way but I wanted to give myself the best chance of recovery so decided to have the surgery and I'm happy to say I am a survivor I have regular mammograms (every two yearly) there is life after breast cancer I'm living proof. Good luck with your research I'm happy to talk to you again if I can be of help xx Report",

      "Content": "Hi there I had a mastectomy 12 years ago and since then have come into contact with many ladies who have had this operation but I have never heard of anyone having this pouch come up, did she have a reconstruction at the same time? I would be extremely worried about this does she have a breast care nurse she can speak to, she should still be under the care of the hospital so the fact that they say there's nothing they can do about this is just not good enough and I would be very quick to tell them that I am not happy with their diagnosis and want further investigations as soon as possible, how long was she in hospital for was there any sign of this pouch then, the fact that they have drained this and found fluid she be convincing them to investigate further, and I would recommend she keeps on at them until she is satisfied, I'm sorry to hear she's not having a good recovery but please try to get her to not let this go. good luck  kind regards suexxxxxxx Report",

      "Content": "Hi there good luck with the holistic treatment I'm not sure what kind of breast cancer your wife has or what treatment has been advised so far, I had a lump that had been growing inwards so without the mammogram it would not have been diagnosed so quickly thankfully it had not spread into the lymph glands so I did not need chemotherapy but I was put on tamoxifen for 5 years which I found no problem. I believe without surgery there can be no way of knowing whether the cancer is just in one place, during the surgery they take various samples to confirm if this has spread through the lymph nodes and to other areas I must admit the wait to find out this information was about 4 weeks and this time was the most nerve racking period of all. My best wishes to you both Sue Report",
