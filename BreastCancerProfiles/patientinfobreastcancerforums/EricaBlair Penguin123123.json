    "Content": "I never found anything to relieve the intense, frequent hot flashes. I stuck with Tamoxifen for one year, then came off it. Been a year now. The hot flashes dropped by about 70%. I never had radiation. Six rounds of TCH/chemo, followed by a mastectomy and then Tamoxifen. Chemo effects are hard on a person, weight gain, hot flashes, Tamoxifen just made it worse. Other than that.....good luck. Hope it works for you without too much hassle. Report 1",
