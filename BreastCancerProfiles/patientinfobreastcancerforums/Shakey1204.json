      "Content": "Hi Sarah, It is all very overwhelming and frightening when it seems time is moving at a snails pace with getting appointments and most importantly, results!  It's so good that you've told your partner as having someone to lean on is really important. Try to think positively, I know only too well how difficult it is right now but it does help.  Razouski is right, it could well turn out to be a simple cyst.  I got cysts constantly when I was younger (42 now), I had 22 in my left breast alone and numerous in the right plus underarm in one MRI scan.  Docs were surprised to say the least! Your a strong woman, with a loving partner and 4 beautiful children.  That's your rock.  You are not in this fight alone, we are all in it with you. Warm wishes and Godspeed, Shakey xx Report 2 Thank you so much shakey it means alot and to be honest i think ive googled far to much can you get cyst in your lythnode as thats what doctor said is swollen but i suppose they dont really know till test are done. Do you know how long test results take and did you ever get any answers the same day? I hope you are well and thank you again x Report Hi Sarah, I luckily have not had any issues with lymph nodes. I have however had cysts in both breasts, overlies ( excruciating when bursting), behind my left ear and worst of all panty line of crotch!!! Im not sure but I think cysts can form in just about any part of the body.  Google it and see?? Results.... ONCE is how often over the past 20 years that I got a result the same day as a biopsy.  That however, was a lumpectomy in hospital and I was absolutely blessed with a simply fantastic surgeon. Are you in the UK?  If your anywhere near \" The Lister Hospital\". My old specialist is now there. Buggar moved half a planet away from me.... Peter Barry has the best bed side manner of any doctor or specialist I've ever seen!  He made the results speedy because he knew how scared I was. Hope this helps xx Report I meant ovaries not overlies  shake Report I will google and see. Wow you are a brave lady keep going though them scares must be awful, i am in the uk im in sheffield so will go to hallamshire hospital, im not holding out to much hope as to getting results that day then, looks like more waiting x Report You are brave too, you just don't know it yet. Stand tall and glare straight ahead at the fear of what might be with the hope of what can be. We are all here to back you every step of the way x Report 1 Your right im causing myself way to much stress, thank you i will keep u all informed x Report 1",

      "Content": "Hi Sarah Shoulder/back pain is no doubt due to the stress your feeling.  Treat yourself to a massage to help you relax. Have a soak in a nice hot tub with some lavender oil and play some relaxing music.  Both will help, if you've found more lumps, report them to your doc. Im in Oz and its Sat arvo so I'm guessing you've had your appointment? Hope all is well, warm wishes, shake. Report",

      "Content": "Hi Razouski, Im 42 and have also had reconstructive breast surgery.  My only option was implants and I understand what you mean with the pain/discomfort.  Foreign objects do feel strange in our body! Unfortunately, I am now 6 yrs down the track and still get buzzing nipples.  It can be overwhelming but it does ease off after some time.  I still wouldn't run and still find overnight bras to be painful or uncomfortable.  The biggest PLUS for us ladies with a roconstruction is as Dee stated, massage!  While it does seem odd, regular massage and movement will help with scar tissue as it has no elasticity.   On occasion, scar tissue continues to grow and 'Capsular Contracture' can occur.  I unfortunately have this and am now in the process of getting ready for more surgery to correct it.  Pain radiates up under my arm and right through my chest.  If you are experiencing this or similar you need to see a specialist. Warm Regards, Shakey Report 1 Thanks Shakey. I'll keep this in mind. I have actually managed, with a combination of two sports bras, pain relief and holding my breast still with my arm to gradually restart the C25K running programme. I'm taking it gently, but now I'm actually able to run for 25minutes without holding my chest, and with only one sports bra. I feel I'm making good progress in that respect. I have been massaging both breasts, and at last the nipple on the augmented side is beginning to be much less painful. I'm feeling a lot more positive now. :-) Report Fantastic!  That's awesome news.  Keep it up, onward and forwards is the way to go indeed.  Shakey x Report",
