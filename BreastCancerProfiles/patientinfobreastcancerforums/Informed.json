    "Content": "Well done Pat for speaking up about the harms of mammograms. So many women walk into these screening tests without finding out anything about them, and just blindly follow all the propaganda. Readers may also like to search on Michael Baum's name, who has also provided much balanced information on the subject, and also the organsation Sense about Science. Do please find out all you can before going for a mammogram. They are entirely optional, and there is a real risk of getting harmful treatment for finding something quite harmless on the mammogram.
