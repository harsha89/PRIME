      "Content": "i am sorry you are in so much pain. Â it is my opinion, only knowing a little about your case, but what the doc did to you is just wrong, forcing you to have yet another surgery. Â the cynic in me wonders if it was done on purpose to make more money or if it was a male doc gratify his needs.Â  Pain goes away after time, several times a day, massage the area with coconut oil where it hurts. I had a major surgery in a differnt area many years ago. In about a year the pain was all gone.Â  I am so srry you have to go through al this.ðŸ’™ Report",

First they said she had stage 0 cancer, did a biospy and radiation (whiched knocked her on her rear for months!), and said it was gone. 5 years later, she had her last mam and they said it would be her last for a while, but they called her and said come in for another look see. She was flipping scared! Â She went it, thankfully it was nothing, but the fear she had was terrible.Â  Because of the scare though, with the advice of her oncol, she decided to change her diet and became a strict vegetarian with little to no dairy and she is meditating and exercising every day. Â She was always sort of a healthy monded person anyway, this just took it to another level. Hang in there, keep breathing. Report",
