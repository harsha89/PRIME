    "Content": "Hi Christine, My oncologist doesn't seem to think aches and stiffness are due to the Letrozole, but more likely to be the ongoing after effects of the chemotherapy.  I too have gone down the same route as you (chemotherapy, surgery, radiotherapy which is ongoing and Letrozole for the next ten years - at least they're optimistic).  I am taking Tramadol Hydrochloride 50 mg for the pain along with an antiflamatory more to do with my osteo arthritic hip though, but it helps with the other things too.  Nowt much to growing old, eh?
