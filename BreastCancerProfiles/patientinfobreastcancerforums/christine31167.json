      "Content": "Hi Diane i also am having problems with sweats and flushes following surgery for breast cancer. I know it's my medication Letrozole because I have already been through the menopause. I also have mood swings and joint ache. Horrible to go through a false menopause when I already have been through one. I am hoping someone has been through the same and can help. The breast cancer and radiotherapy is enough without the other symptoms. Sure there must be something to help us both. Report 1",

      "Content": "Hi Christine, My oncologist doesn't seem to think aches and stiffness are due to the Letrozole, but more likely to be the ongoing after effects of the chemotherapy.  I too have gone down the same route as you (chemotherapy, surgery, radiotherapy which is ongoing and Letrozole for the next ten years - at least they're optimistic).  I am taking Tramadol Hydrochloride 50 mg for the pain along with an antiflamatory more to do with my osteo arthritic hip though, but it helps with the other things too.  Nowt much to growing old, eh?

      "Content": "Hi there thank you for replying to my question. I see my oncologist this Thursday and hope to get more information then. I know I have to take some form of medication to stop my oestrogen from creating more cancers and I am really greatfull that there are such tablets. However, there must be women who have taken Letrozole and have found help through either alternative therapies or complimentary medication.  I am just hoping for help in speeding my way back to good health.  Report",
