    "Content": "Hi Tezi I too have this genetic fault, diagnosed after one of my younger sisters tested positive. She was offered the test after being diagnosed with breast cancer at 47 and ovarian cancer at 49. Also Mum had did of breast cancer in 1989. Also my brother died in 1992 of Pancreatic cancer ( one of the other cancers with BRCA 2 gene) When I got my results it was shown to be that the genetic fault had in fact come from my Dad's side of the family - not my Mum. Hers must have just been a coincidence. However although there are no other breast cancers on my Dads side there are pancreatic, prostate and skin cancers - all related to BRCA 2. I am 61, my dad died at 86, so not all people with BRCA 2 go on to have cancer. So when filling in your family history form - don't just look at breast cancer in the family - look also at ovarian, pancreatic, skin, colo-rectal and prostate (in males). Good luck if you do decide to have the genetic test, I wanted to just for my peace of mind, and it does mean I get annual scans and if I do have a scare - I get a priority check up. thti3290 Report",
