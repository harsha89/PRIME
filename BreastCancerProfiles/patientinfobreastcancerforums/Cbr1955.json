      "Content": "Hello Alex,(cbr55) I'm so sorry for the delay in replying but it has taken me ages to get back into my account even then I have had to re-register., I had 6 bouts of chemo followed by radio after my mastectomy,I've also just had my latest check up where I also asked about pain and the consultant explained it is apparently due to the radio and if I start to get a cold or virus it will hit there first and I must say that I do find that to be true, but if you are not happy about any change or pain mention it as it's best to get it checked, other than that I hope your fine :-) Report",
