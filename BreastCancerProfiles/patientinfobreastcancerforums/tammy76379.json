      "Content": "Hi Tammy, Reassuring news is that the you are going to get through this with a wonderful husband, and you caught this before it spread throughout your body. I want you to know that the medical people who work with breast cancer patients are great. They know how scary this is. My twin and I were diagnosed at the exact same time three years ago with an identical Intraductal Carcinoma, same breast, same time, same markers, same everything. Somehow, because it was caught early, we were not anxious. We both had partial mastectomies and radiation, plus are on Exemestane as the tumors were Estrogen POS, Progesterone POS, Herceptin neg. We had the partial mastectomies due to the calcifications. The tumors were 7mm. There were no involved lymph nodes. I know it wasn't carcinoma in situ, but...we both said, we just wished it was just ourself, so the other twin didn't have to go through it. You will find tremendous support for whatever you do go through, I assure you. If you have the lumpectomy with radiation, I found the best bra to wear is the Bali Cami. BTW, I found that out by asking at the Breast Center where I had my initial mammogram. A lady came out who worked there and told me where to go to buy them. It slips over your head, actually you step into it, because you cannot raise your arm after a lumpectomy, but the microfiber is like silk. I still wear them three years later. You do not feel the bra on you. You join a sisterhood, essentially, helping others through the treatments as you help yourself. Tammy, where do you live? How old are you? I know you will get tremendous care, as all breast cancer patients do. I am a Nurse Practitioner in the States. Please feel free to ask more questions.... Best Wishes Merry Juliana Report 1 Reply",

      "Content": "Hi. Thank you for all the good wishes and info. I just spoke to the breast surgeon that I met a week ago to review my mammogram. She also has calcifications. But she recommended I get the biopsy. Today, she said feels this is totally curable and that her mom had the same thing 25 years ago and had a lumpectomy/radiation with no recurrence. She also told me not to panic and I haven't. Just very nervous. I'm babysitting my granddaughter today and my older granddaughter will be coming home at lunch. I don't have time to panic today....1 year old and 4 1/2. ðŸ¤ª The nurse will be calling shortly to schedule the MRI and then after that, we'll know more. It's the waiting game that gets me. (I live in SW Pennsylvania). And I'm almost 54, also menopausal, hysterectomy last February, still have ovaries. Otherwise, in good health. We do have a history of gastric cancers on my mom's side. My grandmother had breast cancer in her 70's, she had a mastectomy and lived to be 86, her sister had stomach cancer, but her daughter had metastatic breast cancer and passed away recently..... And her brother's daughter had breast cancer. These are my cousins, I realize, but there is a lot of cancer in my family. A LOT! Ugggg. And my dad's side, there's stroke and beautiful cancer. I can't win!!! Anyway, I'll be okay one way or the other. Thanks for everything! Report Reply",

      "Content": "Thank you! And I'm glad your okay. I probably should stay off Google. Not sure if I want to do 6 weeks of radiation. We'll know more after I schedule the MRI with the nurse. I'm just going to push it to the back of my head....I have a lot going on in my life right now, mostly good, some not so good. With anxiety disorder, even on medication, I have to make a conscious effort to control my thinking. So stress isn't good for anyone. I responded to to Merry19451, if you'd like, you can read my response to her. Thank you so much for responding! Report Reply",

      "Content": "Hi I recently had a biopsy due to new calcifications in my breast. Calcifications are nothing new for me but there were two new clusters one the mammogram. The biopsy showed DCIS. Because my husband is a PCP/administrator, I know all of the doctors in our hospital.... And the radiologist is a friend who did the procedure, she herself a brat cancer survivor of 9 years. She called with the results yesterday and said that it's practically a grade zero, and then she went in to say my options were. For now, I'll be getting a breast MRI, and possibly more biopsies. At best, a lumpectomy and 6 weeks of chemo, or if it's widespread a mastectomy, possibly of both breasts. My husband is so reassuring, but of course I'm scared. Really scared. He says that since right now, it's zero grade and NOT invasive, that's the best news regarding this kind of cancer. I trust what he says, but I'm so early into all of this. Can someone reply to me with the same diagnosis. I can't bear any bad stories right now. I have panic and anxiety disorder and it's all I can do to keep it together today. 0 likes, 6 replies Report",

      "Content": "hi. I was diagnosed with dcis in October and had a lumpectomy but 17 of the 18 slides came back positive. at this point it is still dcis and not invasive. so it recommende by a panel of doctors that I have a mastectomy and I'm getting very scared. my surgery is January 4th. I've met with the plastic surgeon and I have a pre-op appointment with my breast surgeon next week. the doctors are all friends of mine as well as colleagues of my husband. I'm confident that I'm going to be getting the best medical care. that doesn't make this any easier for me. I just don't think I'm mentally ready to wake up and see me not having a breast. the plastic surgeon said that he will have the expander in place during that surgery and it will be expanded to almost a full b cup. i just need some advice and encouragement. thank you all? 0 likes, 1 reply Report",

      "Content": "Hi Tammy, Firstly I would like to say how sorry I am to hear that it is necessary for you to have a mastectomy. I know how you feel because I had one 22 years ago at the age of 26. Back then I have to admit that I was more concerned about mortality and the effect it would have on my family rather than the removal of the breast, but it is a huge thing to happen to a woman, and yes I admit it does have it's challenges. However it is not as bad as you first think. I was lucky in a way and didn't have the chance to worry about when I was going to look at the area where my breast once was. I had a very loose dressing around the scar and the first time I got out of bed after the operation and went to clean my teeth, as I bent down the bandage sagged away from my body and there it was. I remember thinking \"well that's not as bad as I thought it would be\". I had what looked like a long worm across where my left breast used to be which went from under my left armpit to my sternum. The skin was raised to look like a worm due to the staples along the scar. I also remember thinking how neat it was. I believe looking at it immediately was a real positive. It also helped me to go and see a couple of friends of my Mum who had also had mastectomy's before the operation. They were very open and just took out their prosthesis's and showed me their scars. This helped me to become mentally prepared for what was to come. With your friends being in the medical profession hopefully they can point you in the right direction to do the same? The best advice I can give you is to stick to your excercise's once the operation is over to help to regain full movement. It really is worth the discomfort. I decided to leave myself with no breast, unfortunately as a Grade 3 I had to have radiotherapy on the area straight away and therefore an expander was not a option for me. Therefore I cannot advise in this area. By the time an operation was offered I was used to what I had and did not want another scar on my back or stomach area to make a new one. I believe you will be surprised by how strong you will be. It is the wondering that is the worst part. After living with no breast for so long I can give you lots of advice. Keep in touch if I can help. Take care of yourself. Report Reply",
