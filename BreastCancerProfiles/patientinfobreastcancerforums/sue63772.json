      "Content": "Hi ladies Thank you all. Such a great site. And I appreciate all ur replys and advise. Like a donut I still haven't been to see my doctor mainly because im hoping its just a swollen gland. Yesterday after talking to my daughter and her asking me to take some pics of my breast and forward them onto her . So took photos . Sat back down ready to look through pics and select one to send to my daughter (who has been a fantastic listener n support) And WOW I was so shocked. \" how did I not notice this\" maybe cause its happened suddenly my right breast has got alot bigger than the other.( normally both breast are pretty much the sameish size ) its massive, no visable lump, iv tried to feel for one but as im a 38dd my breast are always have been lumpy. So cant feel much. But I a sufferer of psoriasis . Have been for 6 ish years so wrn my right nipple started forming a crust it didnt worry me . . Im planning to phone doctors in morning for an appointment. But I doubt that eill happen cause im terrified. What s going on . Help pls? Report",
