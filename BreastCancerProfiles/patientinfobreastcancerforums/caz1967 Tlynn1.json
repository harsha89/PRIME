    "Content": "I have had this happen on a couple of occasions, however it would depend on what is determined as a rash, my problems turned out to start form a scab, which has left scarring, the gp informed me it was a bacterial skin infection When I enquired about the info id read regarding inflammatory breast cancer, I was told it would be a definite rash, similar to nappy rash. I hope you will find the same or similar result and be reassured by your gp. \u200bgood luck  carol   Report Reply",
