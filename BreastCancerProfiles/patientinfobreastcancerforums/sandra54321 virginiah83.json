    "Content": "So sorry you have this worry. Unfortunately until you get your results, there isn't much to be 'done'  I will say I was diagnosed with aggressive cancer 6 years ago, and still here! So please try not to stress too much, lots of very good treatment out there 'if' it is breast cancer. Are you going to a one stop breast clinic, where you get the results the same day?  If not please ask if you have one at your hospital/clinic. A friend of mine has lupus she also has breast cancer,mi have never heard her say she was more susceptible than I was, but perhaps the conversation never came up!  A very good helpline for you. Google, Breast Cancer  Care helpline, they have a forum, but most importantly they have a breast cancer nurse that you can speak to on the phone. She will hopefully put your mind at rest until your results are through. hope all goes well for you on Wednesday. If the results are positive, I am admin for a very good breast cancer group on Facebook, you will find the information and support invaluable. But that is jumping ahead. Until now speak to the breast cancer nurse at BCC. you can send me a pm if you want to talk privately, but until you have the results I am sorry to say the 'waiting room' isn't a nice place to be. hope Wednesday goes as well as it can.
