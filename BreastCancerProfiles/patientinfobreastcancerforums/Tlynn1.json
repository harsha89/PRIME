      "Content": "About 2 weeks ago I noticed my breasts were very very itchy, I also noticed there was a rash with it. Very patchy and dry. I assumed it was dry skin and moisturized. I still have it and it has only gotten worse. It\u2019s on both breasts. Anything I\u2019ve tried to read about has talked about inflammatory breast cancer. I\u2019m very worried and on edge now, just wondering if anyone else has experienced this and what the outcome was. Any feedback is appreciated, thank youðŸ™‚ 0 likes, 2 replies Report",

      "Content": "I have had this happen on a couple of occasions, however it would depend on what is determined as a rash, my problems turned out to start form a scab, which has left scarring, the gp informed me it was a bacterial skin infection When I enquired about the info id read regarding inflammatory breast cancer, I was told it would be a definite rash, similar to nappy rash. I hope you will find the same or similar result and be reassured by your gp. \u200bgood luckÂ  carol Â  Report Reply",
