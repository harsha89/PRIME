    "Content": "Hi mcncheri, I am 28 and have the same problem as you. I just wanted to check if you have been assessed yet and if so, how it went? Thanks  Report I haven't had the actual exam yet, due to my age they only gave me a blood test and a referral, so I'm still awaiting results. The problem still hasn't gone away, but I have read it might be a hormonal imbalance at best ?? I've also noticed that under my left breast it seems to be lumpy in nature, I only hope it's due to acne or something of the sort... I'll be sure to keep you updated! Best. Report",
