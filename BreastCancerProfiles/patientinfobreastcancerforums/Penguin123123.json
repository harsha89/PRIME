      "Content": "I never found anything to relieve the intense, frequent hot flashes. I stuck with Tamoxifen for one year, then came off it. Been a year now. The hot flashes dropped by about 70%. I never had radiation. Six rounds of TCH/chemo, followed by a mastectomy and then Tamoxifen. Chemo effects are hard on a person, weight gain, hot flashes, Tamoxifen just made it worse. Other than that.....good luck. Hope it works for you without too much hassle. Report 1",

Any advice will be much appreciated and I do realise that the tablets can affect people differently. 0 likes, 8 replies Report",

      "Content": "Thanks for your reply EricaBlair. I've read that a lot of people start taking Tamoxifen and then stop it after a short period of time, some as quick as a few months after starting.  Already having hot flushes since having the radiotherapy.  So I will have to see how the tablets affect me.  Thanks again for your advice.
