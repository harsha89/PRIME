    "Content": "The \"purpose\" is only relevant if the actual facts support it. But that isn't the case because the mantra of \"early detection=saving lives\" through mammography hasn't resulted in a notable reduction of breast cancer mortality but instead it has led to a situation where the test causes more harm than good to most women (sources: Mammography Screening: Truth, Lies and Controversy by Peter Gotzsche and The Mammogram Myth by Rolf Hefti). Because the majority of women only have awareness\" of the pro-mammogram messages disseminated by the big medical business (with most mammogram-favorable \"studies\" sponsored by them) few know what the real facts are. Example, very few women understand or know the fact that a lot of breast cancer \"survivors\" are victims of harm instead of receivers of benefit.   Report 1",
