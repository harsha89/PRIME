      "Content": "Hi Tammy, I was diagnosed with DCIS in 2015. It was quite a big spread and in 2 sites on the right breast. Â I had a mastectomy and no further treatment as it had not spread. I\u2019ve been fine ever since except I had to be drained a few weeks after the op because of fluid on the operation site which is totally normal and common. I was offered reconstruction which would be done at the same time as the mastectomy. I declined but it is a personal choice. I wish you well and please don\u2019t worry too much. DCIS is probably the least scary form of breast cancer. Report 1 Reply Thank you! And I'm glad your okay. I probably should stay off Google. Not sure if I want to do 6 weeks of radiation. We'll know more after I schedule the MRI with the nurse. I'm just going to push it to the back of my head....I have a lot going on in my life right now, mostly good, some not so good. With anxiety disorder, even on medication, I have to make a conscious effort to control my thinking. So stress isn't good for anyone. I responded to to Merry19451, if you'd like, you can read my response to her. Thank you so much for responding! Report Reply",

      "Content": "Hallo, this is my first time here. I had a mastectomy and sentinel node surgery 4 days ago. I had DCIS intermediate with 10 cm spread. I get results in 6 days. As I understand it the cancer could have become invasive via the lymph nodes and/or into the chest area. Nobody has really explained the possible further treatments. Has anyone had any experience of this or do you have further knowledge? Thanks. 1 like, 7 replies Report 1",

      "Content": "Hello Sarah I know what you're going through. It's the not knowing and the waiting and the worry that is getting to you? Are you in the UK? If you are, once you get into the system the breast services are very good. you will get a dedicated nurse and phone service. I expect the next step will be a mammogram. Then it's normally 2weeks to get results. So it's waiting and worrying. More than likely it will turn out to be nothing. I know you don't want to tell anyone but be kind to yourself and reach out to a friend or family member that you trust and share your fears. It's no time to try to be strong and suffer alone.

      "Content": "Thanks Caroline, I had good news; the cancer hadn't become invasive. No further treatment, check up in 6 months and yearly mammograms on the remaining breast. I do have oedema around the scar site and the area feels a bit uncomfortable but the surgeon said nothing to worry about. The manual lymphatic drainage sounds a good idea. Thanks for sharing your experience with me and I wish you all the best. Report",
