      "Content": "given that this is a busy time of the year for the postal service, letters might take a bit longer to arrive than usual. as the other posters have said - and as the clerk told you, if there was a problem then they would have called you in earlier. so please try not to worry. Â  Report That is even more terrifying as this is their normal timescale and one they can't see a problem with. So far as they are concerned we sent it out on the very last day of the two weeks, oh and second class so be several days. This is my first ever one so of course I am getting more and more scared as feel either look at things last minute, seen something wrong and making appointments before send letter or hiding something Report",

      "Content": "i think it probably depends on the type of tumour, the location, the size, how advanced it is, whether it has spread anywhere else, the age of the person and any other medical problems that the person has. There is very good information on the cancer research website, and on the macmillan website. There should also be a macmillan nurse / information person that you could talk to at the hopsital. Hope that this helps. Best wishes Report 1",
