    "Content": "Please see your GP ASAP.  This happened to me 11 months ago and unfortunately it was lobular Breast cancer   Drs caught it early. I had to have a mastectomy. I also underwent immediate reconstruction.  Yours may not be BC but get it checked by Medical expert who will be able to put your mind at rest. I am cancer free now and enjoying life again  Best of luck. Keep me updated  Report Reply",
