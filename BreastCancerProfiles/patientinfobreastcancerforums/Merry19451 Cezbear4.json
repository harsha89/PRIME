    "Content": "Hi Cezbear! I would make an appointment with your primary care clinician to have an exam. Many irregularities are actually normal variations of anatomy. That being said, you never know for certain. I am a Nurse Practitioner in the States and performed countless breast exams. One thing is certain, you need to be examined by a professional. They can do an X-ray if they are concerned about the structure, contour, or shape of the breast bone. Please let me know what they find. I shall be thinking of you!
