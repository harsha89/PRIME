    "Content": "I have been on Anastrozole for over two and a half years. After breast cancer I started on Tamoxifen and then after a total hysterectomy in Jan. 2012 I went on Anastrozole. I have had no problems with taking it. I do have hot flashes but I have had those since  the time I started chemo over 5 years ago. I know everyone is different but my experience has been that being on Anastrozole is no big deal. Report Hi, Denise, I have just been prescribed anastrozole, and I was glad to find your post on this site.   Could you please tell me if you experienced hair loss, or any other types of side effects? Thanks so much! Report",
