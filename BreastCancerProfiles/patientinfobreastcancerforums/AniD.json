      "Content": "Hi AniD, Breast cancer tumors are spiculated, ie have spikes or points emanating from them. They do not have the smooth margins. They are not mobile. They are firmly adhered to the tissue wall. They are usually painless. The only way to tell for certain is to have breast biopsies. I would have her see an oncology breast surgeon. She might be eligible for genetic testing. BTW, in addition to the current 25 plus known breast cancer mutations for which there is testing, they have discovered 72 more mutations, but tests have not yet been developed.

      "Content": "Thanks Merry for your quick reply. Given her age and other existing medical conditions, I was hoping to find a non-invasive course of action. The consulting radiologist has recommended a 6 mth follow-up scan at this stage. From a timing as well as procedure standpoint, any other pointers would be welcome. Ani Report Reply",

      "Content": "Hi, My 68 year old mother was diagnosed with a fibroadenoma (BIRADs 2) by the consulting radiologist, after a routine mammography as well as a sonography. The radiologists report says \"multiply round smoothly marginated lesions found in both breasts. No evidence of micro calcification or architectural distortion\". She has a family history of breast cancer (her mother was diagnosed at the age of 89, and her younger sister at the age of 60). I therefore want a second opinion. Thanks!
