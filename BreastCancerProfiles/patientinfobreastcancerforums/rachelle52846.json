      "Content": "I believe most oncologists think that aÂ  mastectomy,rather than a lumpectomy is the best option for a good outcome with this type of cancer,but chemotherapy and radiotherapy are still essential to stop any spread.Â  This must be a shock for you and your family but you must go with what your oncologist has suggested.Â  Â  Report",

Please keep me posted and sending lots of good luck. Report 1",
