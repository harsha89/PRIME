      "Content": "Hi I've always had inverted nipples but in the past 2 months my right nipple has become more so if that makes sense. It has become tight and wrinkly looking, I have examined myself and felt no lumps but am becoming slightly worried. My Dr said not to worry when I brought it up at a recent visit regarding heart palpitations I've been having. I also have a persistent itch on my back behind my right breast. I've also had 3 dreams in the last 2 weeks about having a mastectomy this I find odd. Am I just a crazy hypochondriac or should I go back to the Dr.   0 likes, 9 replies Report",

      "Content": "Thank you all for your replies I saw my gp Tuesday night and she has referred me for an urgent triple assessment. I also along with the inverted nipple I now have an indentation on the underside of my breast. Dr said she couldn't find a lump but wanted me checked anyway, she said I would be waiting at least 5 weeks for an appointment but I got a letter in the post today saying its next Thursday. Fingers crossed all is OK but I have a bad feeling in my gut..  PS it's my left breast that's how stupid I was last week and how long I had spent looking at my breast in the mirror  Report",
