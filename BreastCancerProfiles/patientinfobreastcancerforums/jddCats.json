    "Content": "Hi, Carol: For your own peace of mind, I recommend getting the tests.  But then, I am a worrier.  In my case, it very much paid to worry! I had been getting my annual mammogram for years.  When I was around 50, I started getting \"your results were inconclusive, you need to come back for further testing\" from the breast diagnostic center.  Fine.  I did so, they placed markers in my left breast, and I seemed to be good for a couple of years. When I was 53, I felt something hard (not squishy, no movement, it was just hard) in my left breast.  My internist sent me off to get a core needle biopsy, which came back positive for cancer.  I then got an MRI, which showed a lump of 6 cm x 7 cm x 2 cm - and the yearly mammogram didn't catch it.  Nor did the stupid sonoscans that I went through. My point?  Again, for your peace of mind, please get the additional tests.  I caught my cancer when it was still confined to the breast ducts (DCIS, Stage 0).  I had a bilateral mastectomy, didn't have to do chemo, radiation or take any drugs.   I apologize if this is a bit lengthy, but it truly pays to be proactive. Good luck!   Report 1 Reply Glad to hear that you caught it in time x Report Reply",
