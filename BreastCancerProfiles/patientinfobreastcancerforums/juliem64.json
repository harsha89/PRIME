      "Content": "Hi Blue. I found out Thursday I do have breast cancer. I'm having surgery on the 10th of Nov if all goes to plan. It hasn't hit me yet but all I'm doing is thinking about the future. Will it come back and everything else which I should imagine everyone with cancer thinks and worries the same. How are you doing? Have you had the 2nd op yet? Good luck and all the best Blue. Reply if you feel up to it but I understand if you don't. Julie x Report",

      "Content": "Hi Blue. Sorry you were so down yesterday. Hope you not today and am feeling bit better!. I haven't told my kids well..grown ups as don't want them to worry! I've had enough today. I spoke to my gp and she told me my liver isn't working as it should and I have to have another blood test in January and if the same results I've gotta have investigation. I don't drink anymore. Haven't done so in years and I know the liver can heal itself that's if it hasn't had too much damage which I hope not! I have stage 3 kidney disease too which is stable at present but with what could be cancer too I'm worn out mentally. I never say 'why me' it isn't fair anyone having to go through anything! You are right in the sense that I will find the courage if and when is needed. Thank you again Blue. Take care and I'll keep in touch. x Report",

      "Content": "Hi. Last Thursday I had to go to a 2nd breast screening where I ended up having lots more mammograms plus scan's and 2 biopsies. The specialist/consultant/Dr said that she didn't like the look of one of the particular areas she took a biopsy from. I saw the images and it doesnt have a smooth outlinning unlike the other area. Because of what the Dr said I am more worried. Could this mean it is cancer ? They know what their looking at/for. I guess I'm just getting myself too worked up! I'd appreciate any honest answers. Thank you. Julie. 0 likes, 12 replies Report",

I'm not any good at replying so I'm sorry if I offend you in anyway! I'm not sure what to write ! I'll be glad when next Thursday comes as the hard bit is waiting and then I'll no the answer. I may well find out tomorrow from my blood test results. I dunno. I'm just a mess at the moment as are many others. I'll post results once I find out at some point. Thank you very much Blue for taking time out to reply to me. Julie Report",
