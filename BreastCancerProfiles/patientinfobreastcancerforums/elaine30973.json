      "Content": "Dear Elaine, Often times, the pain comes from hormonal changes before and during one's period. Usually, breast cancer is painless. That being said, I strongly recommend consulting with a physician to have the breast pain evaluated by a professional. You didn't give your age, history of family breast cancer, history of breast feeding, birth control pills, number of pregnancies, live births, that will be helpful to further assess the risk. You will need a breast exam, mammogram, and possibly an ultrasound for the evaluation. Best regards, Merry Juliana Report Reply",
