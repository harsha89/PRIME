      "Content": "i had my yearly breast exam, the doctor felt something, the ultrasound showed 2 masses.  im 32. And scared. I got a biopsy the same day, and im getting my results Monday.  The masses are small, which makes me slightly hopeful. They also performed ultrasound on my lymph nodes which were clear.Which i hope is a good sign. They said its possible its cancer, they couldnt be sure as the masses didnt have a clear 'message' for the docs. I cant hide the fact that im scared obviously.  Already going through another  diagnosis, and im overwhelmed. Im trying to behave as a happy 'child', i dont want my parents to feel my terror. Both of them have gone through cancer, so they are hopeful we caught it early. But yeah, im scared 0 likes, 2 replies Report",
