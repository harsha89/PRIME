      "Content": "Hi Diane i also am having problems with sweats and flushes following surgery for breast cancer. I know it's my medication Letrozole because I have already been through the menopause. I also have mood swings and joint ache. Horrible to go through a false menopause when I already have been through one. I am hoping someone has been through the same and can help. The breast cancer and radiotherapy is enough without the other symptoms. Sure there must be something to help us both. Report 1",
