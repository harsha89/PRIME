      "Content": "Hi all, newbie here. My nana was diagnosed in June with stage 4 very aggressive breast cancer; she also had lupus and was on dialysis 4 times a week........ She just passed away on august 3rd..... my question for everyone would be should the women in our family get screened? We don\u2019t know much about her side of the family because she immigrated here from Ireland and didn\u2019t know much of her family medical history. 0 likes, 6 replies Report",
