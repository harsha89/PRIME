    "Content": "Hi, So sorry to hear about your nana. If there were a lot of breast and ovarian cancers, especially under age 50, in her side of the family then you could ask your GP about your genetic risk. Breast is the most common cancer in women and everyone's risk increases with age (1 in 8 over a lifetime), so one case is unlikely you need extra sceening. We are all offered routine mammogram after age 50. Before 50 and between mammos we can all be 'breast aware'. Breast Cancer Care has a good website with information on what changes to look out for. Hope this helps put your mind at rest. Report High Ann I reallt think as well as a mommogram an Ultra Sound is needed as well, I had a mommogram, and the cancer wasn't detected but an Ultra Sound found it?? Report Thanks ladies. I deff have alot to talk to my doctor about. We dont know much about her family history so its really hard to say if it runs in the family but im definitely educating myself so i am prepared to ask questions when i go in to meet with my doctor.
