      "Content": "Thank you, i just wish the letter would hurry up and arrive so i can make an appointment im so worrid of been messed about again as i said i was referred for a ultra sound but radiology cancelled but when they cancelled it they didnt follow protocol and inform my doctors to refer me to breast clinic they just put it in the note but didnt follow itÂ  though so my doctors have made a complain about it but that was 3 weeks of waiting for nothing now back to waiting. Ive googled everything possible, im more scared for my kids i cant leave them yet there to young thats all that keeps me going im trying to be very mentaly strong just in case they say its cancer as i will fight with everything i have but im also trying to keep in mind it mostly likly is something less sinister, i think its because doctors have actually said she needs breast clinic for breast cancer rule out it shocked me abit. hope you are well.

Report Hi Sarah, I can understand what you're going through! Â But please remember that finding out what's going on will take some time. The waiting is necessary, because the doctors will know more after they see you and possibly do tests. Â The results will let them respond appropriately. Try not to lose heart! Â Be good to yourself and take it easy, as much as you can. Â We're here for you! x Report Hi Sarah Shoulder/back pain is no doubt due to the stress your feeling. Â Treat yourself to a massage to help you relax. Have a soak in a nice hot tub with some lavender oil and play some relaxing music. Â Both will help, if you've found more lumps, report them to your doc. Im in Oz and its Sat arvo so I'm guessing you've had your appointment? Hope all is well, warm wishes, shake. Report",

      "Content": "Hello Sarah I know what you're going through. It's the not knowing and the waiting and the worry that is getting to you? Are you in the UK? If you are, once you get into the system the breast services are very good. you will get a dedicated nurse and phone service. I expect the next step will be a mammogram. Then it's normally 2weeks to get results. So it's waiting and worrying. More than likely it will turn out to be nothing. I know you don't want to tell anyone but be kind to yourself and reach out to a friend or family member that you trust and share your fears. It's no time to try to be strong and suffer alone.
