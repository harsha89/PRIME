    "Content": "Hi all, I'm 30 year's old woman, my mum was diagnoised with breast cancer at the age of 32. She had too have her breast removed but she's fine now and she's 57 and healthy. I have filled out a family history form..I have no other members in my family who had breast cancer except my mothers father's sister. She got breast cancer in her 60's..I'm very worried about my health and risk. Could there be a genetic link? I was told it's only when 2 same family members and not one... I have had my breasts checked by a gp and she said there fine..she did feel a slight thicking in my right breast but she said it was normal..and that it could be my menstural cycle..I recently had fibroid surgery and haven't had a period in 6 months..so I guess my hormones are mixed up! I'm just really scared and become almost obsesseb about checking my breasts Please help Tezi xx 0 likes, 3 replies Report",
