    "Content": "Interesting I never heard of it affecting vocals. I do suggest getting an eye exam before starting any dose of Tamoxifen. I was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2006. Started 10mg of Tamoxifen daily in May 2007. Shortly after I found my eyes were quite blurry and I bought a few pairs of reading glasses. During my routine yearly physical I spoke to the doctor about it. At the time my last eye exam was 5 years prior. Two weeks later I had an eye exam. My vision was measured as left 125 and right was 75 and the opthalmologist told me I had Tamoxifen Retinopathy of the left eye and only a very very small amount of people have been diagnosed with low dose retinopathy. She consulted with my oncologist, he agreed and I discontinued with the medicine. Norma Jean Report",
