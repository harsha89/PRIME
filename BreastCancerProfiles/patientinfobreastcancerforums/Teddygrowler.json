      "Content": "I had a left sided mastectomy with reconstruction at the end of Oct last year after 3 previous unsuccessful ops between August and September to try and remove my dcis. Started on tamoxifen at the end of November. On 4th January this year (I remember the exact day) I started with pain in my lower back and I am still suffering. Also get cramping in my legs and my hips and feet ache. Doctor says it is muscular rather than the tamoxifen but there are numerous forums with plenty of people on tamoxifen complaining of joint pain. Had a bone scan but all clear. I have had enough. Stopped taking the tamoxifen about 2 weeks ago but still in pain. Different opinions as to how long it can take tamoxifen to leave the body. Anyone have any ideas or have experienced the same symptoms? 0 likes, 5 replies Report",

      "Content": "Hi Did you  have chemotherapy? I was wondering if your aches from your feet could be from that.  Google Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, I have had lots of problem with my feet since chemo, I had taxotere. i am pretty sure your aches and pains are from tamoxifen, for some reason oncologist seem to disagree, I belong to a breast cancer group, and hear of lots of ladies with the same problems as yourself. Perhaps you could join some of the groups, they may have some suggestions to help with the aches and pains. Report",

      "Content": "Hi, after 3 attempts (3 ops) to remove my dcis in 2015 I had a left sided mastectomy with immediate reconstruction with an implant in the October. Because my skin had been damaged after 3 previous incisions, I didn't have enough skin to cover the same size implant as my remaining right breast so a slightly smaller one was fitted and no nipple. However it was the right decision for me. I just add a small insert in my bra. I think that having nothing on one side wouldve put my body out of kilter and given me back problems. I was 49 then. I just got it over and done with, couldn't face prolonging future surgeries and more hospital visits, not worth it. Everyone's decision IS unique to them. So sorry about your diagnosis but there is light at the end of the tunnel. I'm happy with life again and have just had to get on with my body being different. It could've been a lot worse right? Good luck xxx Report",

Have been on it, off it, on it, then off again, hot flushes, night sweats, bad back, aching legs and feet, mood swings, tearful, no quality of life. Decided not to take it anymore, taking my chances. Would rather have quality of life. Check with your oncologist. Everyone's choice is individual and shouldn't sway you either way. Report",
