    "Content": "Hi T! I am a Nurse Practitioner who used to perform breast clinics. I also have breast cancer. Your breast mass is smooth and moveable and tiny. Those three factors inform me it is not breast cancer. Breast Cancer adheres to the chest wall, is irregular in shape, and usually larger than a pea, when found. I do congratulate you on your immediate follow up with your physician. When in doubt, always check it out. Follow your maternal instincts regarding your baby-child, as well. A mother always knows when something isn't right with her child. Never let a physician be condescending to you! Best wishes with your pregnancy! Please let me know the results of the ultrasound! I have found a lot of breast cancer in women and an occasional man, but it is never freely moveable, nor does it have a smooth contour. It needs anchors for a blood supply, and is growing in a disorganized chaotic manner, which is a description of a cancer. Best wishes Merry Juliana Report Reply",
