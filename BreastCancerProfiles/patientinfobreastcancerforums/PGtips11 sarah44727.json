    "Content": "Hello Sarah I know what you're going through. It's the not knowing and the waiting and the worry that is getting to you? Are you in the UK? If you are, once you get into the system the breast services are very good. you will get a dedicated nurse and phone service. I expect the next step will be a mammogram. Then it's normally 2weeks to get results. So it's waiting and worrying. More than likely it will turn out to be nothing. I know you don't want to tell anyone but be kind to yourself and reach out to a friend or family member that you trust and share your fears. It's no time to try to be strong and suffer alone.
