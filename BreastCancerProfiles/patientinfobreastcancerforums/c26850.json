      "Content": "Just thought I would let you both know that I feel very blessed to get a clear result on the mri , no idea as to what the breast lump is. May just be the way I was made or some fatty tissue but mri screen showed no suspicions of malignancy . I sincerely Thankyou both for your kind words during my anxious times , I can\u2019t imagine what it\u2019s like going through something so threatening but I can genuinely say this experience involving scary machines and awaiting results has certainly opened my eyes to appreciating the more important things in life . We are very lucky to be here and not every day is granted , let\u2019s live our lives to the fullest . Sending positives vibes to all xÂ  Report Such great news and what a relief - I am so happy for you! I somehow felt strongly that everything would be fine for you in advance. But should my instinct have failed me, I was prepared to support you by letting you know that going through the \"bad news\" and the following experience, precisely leads to the same conclusion you came to today: \"Don't take anything for granted and enjoy what you have to the fullest\". Going through the whole survival process does make that message sink in forever! All the best and celebrate your weekend! Greg. Report",

      "Content": "Could anyone please ease my mind . I had an ultrasound on a very moveable lump before Christmas . Ultrasound results came back normal . My doctor sent me for another opinion and the lump is faulty big and this morning A doctor who done the Ultrasound said he found a definite palpable lump and is recommending an mri over a biopsy . This worries me why not a biopsy . I\u2019m only 31 with two beautiful children . He mentioned a lump my size would have possibly spread by now therefore he wasn\u2019t too worried . I don\u2019t get the comment , is he checking via mri to see if it\u2019s spread meaning he thinks it\u2019s dangarrous . He said possibly lipoma but the other sonography said it wasn\u2019t a lipoma . I\u2019m so confused , so scared and don\u2019t know how to feel .Â  0 likes, 8 replies Report",

      "Content": "Thankyou for your response Greg and I\u2019m sorry to hear about your diagnosis . I just dont feel comfortable with my doctors due to the first ulstrasound being normal and only weeks later the second ultrasound showing \u201c something \u201c I guess I don\u2019t understand the mri scan rather than biopsy . Thankyou for your reassurance though , Ita good to talk to people who may actually have a little insight . I have Â been so upset all day and I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m over Â reacting . The sonograoher made comment on the size of the lump which made me think the worst , I\u2019ve also had headaches for weeks which I was working with but now my anxiety has kicked in and I\u2019m worried the breast lump and headaches are related . Â  Again Thankyou for taking the time to respond , it\u2019s appreciated more than you know .Â  Report",

      "Content": "Thankyou both so much for your thoughtful words . I will let you know how things go , I have an mri Friday so not too long of a wait thankfully . My doctor has suggested after reading the ultrasound report that although the size and feel doesn\u2019t always characterise cancer , the odds are in my favour being soft and \u201c smooth \u201c apparently . Â I\u2019m keeping positive and just adoring my beautiful children even more . ThankyouÂ  Report",

      "Content": "There is no point in feeling anxious before you get your test results, because there are many varieties of harmless non-cancerous tumours asides from the classic and widespread lipoma. Your doctor just wants to get a clear picture of what your lump is all about, and feels an MRI will be more helpful than any other method to find out. Doctors usually perform a biopsy right away if they have serious doubts you may have cancer. That is what happened in my case; my doctor told me straight off that the lump she touched had about 80% odds of being cancer, and the biopsy came back positive. Good luck, Greg Report 1",
