    "Content": "Hey Christine31167 I have been taking  letrozole now for 18 months. I was 32 on diagnosis and so pre-menopausal but due to not being able to take tamoxifen as soon as I finished radio I had my ovaries removed & was started on letrozole. My hot flushes originally were terrible & some days prevented me from going out because as soon as moved I would be all clammy. Gradually over time they have improved massively & now on average have about 8 a wk with prob 1 day a month being terrible. I can cope with that. My other side effects are not so great I am now 34 yet when I wake in the morning I feel about 90.....no joke. All my legs & fingers are so stiff I literally shuffle about until I loosen up!! I also get terrible hip pain both sides at night. I spoke to my surgeon, oncologist & gp and they all said the same which was my pain & stiffness is without doubt due to letrozole . I have to say my pain is def better than the first 6 months I had taken it. I asked my oncologist if maybe I could take it every other day but she said if I did that I would be high risk of my tumour returning so sadly letrozole is the lesser of two evils. I have also just recently started having vaginal bleeding which again is a side effect of letrozole & I am waiting on a day to go in hospital for a gynae app so they can check my uterus with a camera because as with tamoxifen letrozole can cause uterine cancer & or bleeding. I really hope this has helped clarify a few things.  All the best x Report",
