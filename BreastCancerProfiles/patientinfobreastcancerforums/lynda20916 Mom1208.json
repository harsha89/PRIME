    "Content": "I was offered arimidex by my surgeon/oncologist after surgery for endometrial cancer last year.  I didn't have to do anything, really, as I was staged at 1A.  I took the arimidex for three weeks.  I was very careful, and took partial doses for a few days, until I was at full dosage.  It was hell.  My joints became sore and immobile. My whole body ached. I could barely shuffle 25 feet to the mail box.  I was unable to sleep, full of adrenaline.  I stopped after 3 weeks (I had started taking it in August).  It took until the end of December for the side effects to dissipate! I had done lots of research before starting it.  The drug didn't bother some women.  Others had terrible side effects, worse than mine. a few quit the drug, saying that they'd take the risk of getting cancer again, but in the interim, they'd prefer to have some quality of life.    Report",
