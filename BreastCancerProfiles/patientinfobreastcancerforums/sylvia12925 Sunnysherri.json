    "Content": "Hi Sunnysherri, I'm not a doctor but I have just finished treatment for breast cancer (IDC).  The only thing I can say with confidence is that microcalcifications have the ability to turn cancerous.  This is as per the oncologist, radio-oncologist and surgeon and I mention it because I have 4 microcalcifications that were there initially and were not removed for some reason.  They can also appear due to radiation therapy.  They will be closely monitored, however, this is because I've just had breast cancer. That being said, here are a few links I found relative to some of the terms you indicated in your post.  It would SEEM that they ae benign, but the oncologist is your best source and she/he will do whatever tests are required in order to rule everything out.  Knowledge is power and I think doing some reading may help you focus on the positive! http://breast-cancer.ca If you scroll down on this webpage, there is a search bar.  Below are two that you mentioned. http://breast-cancer.ca/papily/ The one above appears to be fairly easy to understand, (regarding Peripheral Papilloma) http://breast-cancer.ca/sclerosdenosis/ Same site again, (Sclerosing adenosis) Best of luck!  Looking forward to positive news!
