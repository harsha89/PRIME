      "Content": "I\u2019ve had severe eczema all my life ( I am 14-turning 15 in two months) and it started to improve when I was 11. I noticed some white crusty type skin on both my nipples , More on my right, a couple week ago so I just cleaned it and carried on. I noticed it again earlier so I cleaned it and then thought is this Normal? Obviously, google isn\u2019t the best option but I am embarrassed by it so I decided to google \u2018is crusty skin on nipples normal?\u2019. The first thing that came up was pagets. I read the symptoms - on many many websites including this one, and the main symptoms are an inverted nipple ( and I have an inverted nipple on my right breast) , eczema type skin ( I\u2019ve never had a problem with my eczema on my breasts) , itchy nipples ( which I\u2019ve had really bad lately) and pain (which I get on my period now and then so I don\u2019t really know about that one). I sat here googling if I am too young, but many teenagers get breast cancer. I\u2019m way too embarrassed to ask a friend and I don\u2019t want to panic my mom, so I\u2019m asking on here. Does it seem like I have breast cancer? And what should I do? I\u2019m trying to calm myself and say \u2018 leave it for a bit\u2019 but then I get scared of development. Please reply whether your a medical professional or not, I need advice  0 likes, 3 replies Report",

      "Content": "Dear Elle, I am a Nurse Practitioner with breast cancer and eczema. I was just checked out for Paget's Disease, BTW. Breasts get very itchy around your period. Every woman will vouch for that. Eczema occurs on both breasts. Paget's Disease only occurs on one breast !!!! Breast Cancer does not hurt. Breasts are painful before and during your period. I doubt highly that it is Paget's Disease, as it is on both your breasts. That being said, it is a concern of yours, so I would tell your Mom. The eczema on your breasts needs to be treated, evaluated by a medical professional, and perhaps biopsied. Has your one nipple always been inverted, or is this a recent change? I know that the thought that you might have breast cancer is scary. While I always go with the maxim, \"When in doubt, check it out, \" I feel the likelihood of your having breast cancer is close to zero. I am not minimizing your concerns, however. I had a breast mass checked out when I was 13 or 14 by a male physician. It was benign,. and the doctor was so very sweet and understanding. I couldn't sleep, I was so anxious about it. Please let me know what you find out. Best Wishes to you! Do you have an excellent dermatologist for your eczema? Merry Juliana Report Reply",

      "Content": "Hello, Thank you for this information  I overthink everything and I don\u2019t think me researching it all is any help either, but this has eased my worries I have always had this inverted nipple, so I think I am just connecting the dots in the wrong way so thank you!  And yes, I have a very good dermatologist who has helped my eczema improve so much Report Reply",
