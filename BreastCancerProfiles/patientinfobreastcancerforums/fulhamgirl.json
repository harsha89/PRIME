However, the Doctors are not as pleased with her progress as they would like, and have arranged a course of Radio-therapy. My Mother is not happy at the prospect of this - what then would be the result of not going ahead with that!??    1 like, 3 replies Report 1",

      "Content": "Radiotherapy has temporary side-effects including potential for low white blood cell count called leukemia, weak immune system. I've yet to begin radiotherapy for sore thoracic/cervical vertebral hemangioma ive had for over two documented month, due to some unidentified infection in my lungs that was discovered on scans; because of the risks of weak immunology. From my understanding radiotherapy is less invasive than chemo? Yet I don't know much about the treatment process although my mother had breast cancer when I was young. Report",
