    "Content": "Hi I took Arimadex for about 18 months and thought I was going to die from pain.  Every joint in my body felt as though I was being stabbed over and over again.  It got so bad I couldn't walk and told my oncologist I would rather die from a further bout of cancer than carry on taking them.   He changed my prescription to Exemestane and wow what a difference - it took about 6 days before I began to feel like I was a normal woman again.  I have been taking them now for 3 years and have had no problems with them at all.  I hope you can sort this out and can't understand why they haven't offered you an alternative.  Report",
