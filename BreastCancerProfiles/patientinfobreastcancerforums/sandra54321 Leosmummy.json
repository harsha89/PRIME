    "Content": "Hi Leosmummy, what have they said is the cause of the indentation? Please don't be fobbed off, there must be an explanation, the breast doesn't get indentation for no reason. Ask for further tests, biopsy, or make sure they check it again in three months.  Lobular breast cancer doesn't always show on a mammogram, so please insist they check again. as for the 'incidental' they mean while they were checking mainly your left breast they found something in your right, so 'just by chance'  indentation will not be due to your body changing.  You need to be kept an eye on until they have some answers. i belong to a breast cancer group and can only say I have known ladies get the all clear, then 2/3 months later diagnosed with breast cancer, not trying to frighten you, but you need an answer to the indentation! Good Luck  Report 1",
