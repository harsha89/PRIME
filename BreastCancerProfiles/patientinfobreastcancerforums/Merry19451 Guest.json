    "Content": "Hi Myachinback! Usually, breast cancer does not cause any discomfort or pain or aches. You certainly would not have one mass pop up suddenly, then another the next day. Enlarged lymph nodes do hurt, and will pop up acutely during a viral or bacterial infection. Breast Cancer grows slowly, and is painfree in the beginning. Infections occur quickly and are painful. Have you examined your breasts? A breast cancer mass is hard, fixed, immobile, irregular contour, and painless. A benign mass is mobile, regular contour, can be sometimes sore due to hormonal changes, and change size due to your period. If you have an infection in your hand, such as an infected finger, you can get swollen and painful lymph nodes in your armspit. If you are nursing, and have mastitis, you can also have swollen lymph nodes in the armpit. As I have become older, I have learned not to worry about about stuff. Why, you ask? Most stuff never happens! When stuff happens, it is never as bad as your or my imagination. You are much stronger than you think you are. ( from a former ICU nurse and Nurse Practitioner who survived attempted murder twice, breast cancer, and two strokes, and is thriving!) Best Regards, Merry Juliana Report 3 Reply",
