    "Content": "Breast MRI scan Share on facebook Share on twitter Bookmark & Share Printer-friendly version A breast MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan is an imaging test that uses powerful magnets and radio waves to create pictures of the breast and surrounding tissue. It does not use radiation (x-rays). A breast MRI may be done in combination with mammography or ultrasound. But it is not a replacement for mammography. MRI provides detailed pictures of the breast. It also provides clear pictures of parts of the breast that are difficult to see clearly on an ultrasound or mammogram. Breast MRI may also be performed to:     Check for more cancer in the same breast or the other breast after breast cancer has been diagnosed     Distinguish between scar tissue and tumors in the breast     Evaluate a breast lump (usually after biopsy)     Evaluate an abnormal result on a mammogram or breast ultrasound     Evaluate for possible rupture of breast implants     Find any cancer that remains after surgery or chemotherapy     Guide a biopsy (rare)     Screen for cancer in women at very high risk for breast cancer (such as those with a strong family history)     Screen for cancer in women with very dense breast tissue An MRI of the breast can also show:     Blood flow through the breast area     Blood vessels in the breast area Report",
