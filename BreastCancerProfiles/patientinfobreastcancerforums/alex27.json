      "Content": "I had a partial mastectomy (lumpectomy) in Oct 2008/2009 followed by radio. The scar area has always been tender with some parts of the skin numb to touch. Just lately though, the whole breast area is aching worse than usual. I had a normal mammogram in December and a recent examination which was fine. I mentioned the tenderness but was told that it was normal as long as it wasn't worse than usual. Well it's worse than usual. I'm not sure if I should be concerned or not... Report",

      "Content": "Thanks for the reply. I'm feeling back to normal now, with the pain at the usual manageable levels. Yes, I'm on Tamoxifan but have never had any noticable side effects. Side effects from the radio can manifest years later, so maybe this was just something from that. But it's settled down now, thank goodness. Report",
