    "Content": "Hi Knowing ladies who have had breast cancer with a low risk of it coming back l would say, take Tamoxifen!! two of the ladies breast cancer came back and spread. both were 'low' chancef it coming back.  I am sorry to say, they don't know enough about the different breast cancer, or they would be somewhere near finding a cure. It all seems very hit and miss, there are some amazing treatments out there, but they still are not 100% So l think you should take a chance.  I know ladies that have no problem with Tamoxifen, it is like any drug, and we all different with how with cope with the side effects. If you are borderline, then l guess in a year or two they will suggest you change to Aromatase inhibitors,hich are for post menopausal ladies.  There is a  study that suggest it is better to stay on AI's for more than 5 years.  I have been on them for 6 years and will continue for at least another 4 years and who knows could be forever!  I am more than happy to stay on the AI's anything that will give me a chance. l don't want any 'if only l had taken the drugs' if it returns/spreads. I wish you well in whatever your decide. Are you in the UK? Report",
