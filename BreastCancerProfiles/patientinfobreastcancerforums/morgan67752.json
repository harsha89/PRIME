    "Content": "Hi, I'm a 36-year old woman, mother of two kids. I have been working in a private firm in Ottawa. I need a help from the people over here. Recently I was diagnosed with breast cancer. I was really shocked to hear the test result. As a single parent, I'm concerned about my kids who are under 5. I had a disability insurance and when I consulted the company, they denied the disability pay. The reason is that the lump was already there in the breast, before taking the insurance! But, I'm sure I was not having it during that time. I had undergone a medical checkup during that time and the doctor asked me not to worry about anything. And I was completely healthy. I want to know whether there is an option to claim for the insurance. In my search, I came across a disability claims lawyer in Ottawa ( http://www.sginjurylaw.ca/long-term-disability-claims/ ). Can I consult them for a service? Does anyone know more about them? Or do you have any other suggestions? 0 likes, 0 replies Report",
