    "Content": "I got a lump it was sore. I went to the dr then he made me go get ultrasound, then mammogram.  It's still a toss up though... so going to see Surgeon next week for biopsy.  Pretty scared right now. If you're really concerned. Just go to another dr.  Or just request to get an ultrasound... but that mammogram squishes your boobies.  I had mine since May.  I could still there but it move since or it went smaller...  Report 1 Reply",
