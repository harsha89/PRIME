    "Content": "The literature I received here in Scotland prior to my breast screening clearly stated the pros and cons of breast screening. I understood that I may end up receiving treatment for a cancer that may have gone undetected and never bothered me. I clearly understood this when welcoming the mammogram (due to a family history). Why do you say the majority of women only have awareness of the pro-mammogram messages? Is this literature not disseminated throughout the UK? So some people may have surgery or treatment when they might not have needed it, a shame but not the end of the world - however, what about those women who definately did need treatment and only found out via a mammogram? You state that the test 'causes more harm than good to most women'. What do you mean by that? That for every 1 person whose life is saved, two may have uneccessary treatment such as a biopsy or radiation etc? If so I would gladly be one of those who may have 'unnecessary' treatment should it save someone else's life.   Report",
