    "Content": "Hi Pamela, Im so sorry to hear this.  I hope you are ok.  There is some information on the internet about this, however reading stuff on here is probably not the best idea, it did mention lobular which is what my cousin had, she had treatment and is ok now.  My cousin had a genetic link as her fathers mother and his sister had it.  I hope everything is ok for you. Kindest regards Niki x Report",
