      "Content": "I went for my 1st screening today, was umming and amming about it as have read stuff about it.  I think we just have to all go for it.  What Pat was saying is actually correct, its the same with cervical screening you can get false positives etc etc. meaning that roughly 17 out of a 1000 women will have surgery/treatment for something that may have never turned into anything.  I understand that the ering on the side of caution r is better then and potential cancer being left to its own devices which is why i went today.

      "Content": "Hi Pamela, Im so sorry to hear this.  I hope you are ok.  There is some information on the internet about this, however reading stuff on here is probably not the best idea, it did mention lobular which is what my cousin had, she had treatment and is ok now.  My cousin had a genetic link as her fathers mother and his sister had it.  I hope everything is ok for you. Kindest regards Niki x Report",
