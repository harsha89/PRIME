      "Content": "I had a mastectomy on December 12th 2013. I still have a pouch beneath my left arm where I also had 3 lymph nodes removed. It doesn't hurt, but sometimes feels a bit uncomfortable. When I went for my first annual breast check, I was told that surgeons sometimes leave extra tissue behind, in case further surgery is needed at a later date. It gives a bit extra room to perform such surgery. She also told me I could opt to have it 'tidied up' if I wanted. It might be a good idea to ask  if this would be possible at a later date, when she has recovered from the mastectomy. Report",

      "Content": "Hello Charlotte, First to put your mind at rest a litte. A lump and thickened breast tissue MIGHT mean breast cancer, but quite often turn out to be quite harmless. Although some women do get breast pain with breast cancer, there are many who don't. I didn't have any pain with mine, even though it had spread into one of my lymph nodes. The swollen lymph nodes COULD also be a sign of breast cancer, but they could just mean you have some kind of infection and the lymph nodes are mopping it up. That's what they are for.. My suggestion to you is to go to the Breast Cancer Care website.  They have a free helpline where you can chat to a nurse specialising in breast cancer. There are also sections (and downloadable info) on the various benign breast conditions that you might have. I don't know how long you have to wait for your appointment to the breast clinic, but that is the only way you will really know for sure whether you do have BC or not. I'll  keep my fingers crossed for you. xx Report 1",

      "Content": "Letrozole is an aromatase inhibitor. Aromatase inhibitors stop the production of estrogen in postmenopausal women. Aromatase inhibitors work by blocking the enzyme aromatase, which turns the hormone androgen into small amounts of estrogen in the body. This means that less estrogen is available to stimulate the growth of hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer cells. Aromatase inhibitors can't stop the ovaries from making estrogen, so aromatase inhibitors only work in postmenopausal women. Tamoxifen on the other hand, prevents the ovaries from producing Oestrogen, which means it is the drug usually given to pre-menopausal women. Ask you oncologist what percentage hormone positive your tumour was. Mine was 100% Oestrogen and 70% Progesterone, but as I am 63, I am taking Anastrazole (another aromatase inhibitor). If yours was only minimally hormone positive, you might not need to take a hormone tablet. Report",

      "Content": "Hello Sophie, The most effective therapies depend on what receptors - if any - your breast cancer has. If your tumour proves to be hormone positve (ER+ and/or PR+) then somewhere along the line you will be offered anti hormone drugs for at least 5 years. They are not effective with hormone negative tumours.  If your tumour is HER2 positive (epidermal growth hormone) you will need Herceptin, which is a targeted therapy. This will have no effect on hormone positive tumours. But it is usually given alongside chemotherapy.  Chemotherapy is usually offered when (in the UK in any case) if the tumour is grade 3, or has several lymph nodes involved, or you are very young (under 55) at diagnosis. Or, if your cancer is what is called triple negative (ER- , PR- , HER2-) as there are no other therapies for this type of breast cancer. Some women are triple positive (ER+ , PR + and HER+ and will be offered all the therapies the oncologist feels will treat your cancer best. For more information, visit the Breast Cancer Care website, where you can download booklets about all types of breast cancers and their subtypes. An example is my own cancer. It was grade 3 with lymph node involvement, ER+ PR+ HER2-  So I had chemo, followed by anti hormone tablets. Radiotherapy is usually offered too. I refused that as I have a lung disease and didn't want to harm my lungs any more. This is a generalisation, and it would be best to check either on the Breast cancer care website, or the Macmillan website. Report thank you for the help, was you happy with your therapies you chose or would you have changed them? Report I was very happy with my decisions, I wouldn't have changed any of them and would make the same decisions again if necessary (Heaven forbid ) Report",
