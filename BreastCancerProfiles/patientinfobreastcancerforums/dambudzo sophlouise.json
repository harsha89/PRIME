    "Content": "i think it probably depends on the type of tumour, the location, the size, how advanced it is, whether it has spread anywhere else, the age of the person and any other medical problems that the person has. There is very good information on the cancer research website, and on the macmillan website. There should also be a macmillan nurse / information person that you could talk to at the hopsital. Hope that this helps. Best wishes Report 1",
