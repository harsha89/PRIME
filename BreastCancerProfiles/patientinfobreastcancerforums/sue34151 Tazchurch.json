    "Content": "Hi there don't listen to other people I did that for five years and eventually when I was fifty I went and had a mammogram I it was nothing like I expected uncomfortable yes but definitely not painful and unfortunately my first one detectected a lump growing inside I would never have noticed it and maybe if I had gone five years before i wouldn't have had to have a mastectomy and ongoing treatment. Just a few minutes that's all it take and then it's all over better to have regular mammograms  Report",
