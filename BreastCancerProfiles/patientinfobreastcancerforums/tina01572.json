      "Content": "Hi Lynda I got my bloods back all were ok except c reactive protein which was 7 when it should be between 1-3. I have read mixed things about this some say over 10 is high so mine slightly elevated.... for some serious conditions it is over 100 or high 20s. I think it depends on the underlying condition so can't really use as a guide. I have read people diagnosed with lymphoma had levels of between 4-10. So I guess it is just indicative and depends on the individual. I have also developed 2 large swellings in my neck over the weekend. I don't know what they are there is one on each side sitting under my arteries. One is the size of a golf ball and one is about the size of a bouncy ball just slightly smaller. They aren't particularly hard. And are moveable but they are only visible in certain positions if I yawn ...cough or clench my teeth. They aren't obvious if I am just standing upright. My haemotology app has come through and is 8 days away...so a long wait . It's hard because the veins/artery over them are quite thick....i don't know of its meant to be there. I have also lost 5lb this week without really doing anything different! Hopefully I will know more next week x Report",

      "Content": "Hi Lynda Things have moved on slightly. Feeling a little better and my gp is taking me seriously now. CT: so turns out all my nodes are well below 1cm. The ones in the neck especially. The only slightly enlarged ones where in my armpit and they were 9mm so still not a cause for concern. Groin: the lump isn't related to the lymph nodes so I am having an ultrasound to rule out anything sinister. My gp has said it could just be a lipoma and as it's close to the surface on the skin the ultrasound should show it clearly. Bloods: I have had Epstein barr previously but it's not active now so they have said that may explain why there may be some slight raised nodes that haven't gone down. All other bloods have been normal. Larger lumps either side at the front of my neck: I can still feel these and they have a weird tingling sensation. Doctor has said the are soft tissue muscle related and she isn't concerned Ed but to keep an eye on them. Thyroid. The CT showed a small thyroid nodule which they arent concerned about. They have suddenly realised I haven't had a thyroid function test or hormone level test and that this could explain night sweats. I have been booked in to have these. I think from the sounds of things now it's unlikely to be lymphoma. I'm hoping there's a simple explanation for it all. Feeling more positive now though xx Report",

She said the groin swelling is a hard mass.....but it's not a hernia she said neck nodes alone aren't concerning they are there but they shouldn't be (they don't feel hard) the ones behind my ear shouldn't be there and are hard and one is quite big and noticeable...she had said that are suspicious as there is no sign of infection anywhere.

      "Content": "I am I need of some advice. Been suffering bad low back pain for a few months. This week my boyfriend found a lump on my neck near my clavical it's around 1.5 cm and rubbery. Upon inspection my lymph nodes under my jaw are swollen and there is another lump on the other side. This has prompted me to look for other swollen nodes and it seems like the nodes in both my breasts are swollen. I actually think my right breast has a lump. The problem is I am.not sure...my breasts are quite small. Does this mean I should be able to feel my nodes?? I can't feel them under my armpit bit they are definitely there in my breast and palpable...quite hard. In terms of the lump...it's quite big...it's definitely say around 3cm it's irregular in shape and more like a mass. I don't know if it is a cluster of nodes ...but it feels different to the rest of my breast. It's above my right nipple (same side my lymph node on my neck). Does anyone have any advice they can give re breast lumps...what should I be be to feel? 0 likes, 31 replies Report",

      "Content": "So Lynda mixture of good news and bad. I'm afraid I am still a bit in limbo. My CT didn't show any masses. Although I didn't get given a copy of the report nor did I get to go through each area where I have inflammation. My Haemotologist has said she doesn't think I have lymphoma ...and that the nodes are swollen but only around 1cm if just bigger in the neck. In terms of the groin she is not sure and she didn't comment on what the CT scan said about that area. But I have a definite swelling/mass. She was going to refer to multidisciplinary team and come back to me on next steps there but she didn't think it was lymphoma. I didn't really probe on this and wished I had. I was distracted as she had said everything is fine but then back tracked. From what I could gather there is a node there bit it's size isn't a cause for concern ?? Or is just within margins. I am getting a copy of CT report next week so I can see for myself. Because I am still having night sweats she is going to see me again in 8 weeks and if I have continued to have them she will do a bone marrow biopsy. I'm not really sure what to think as I would prefer a biopsy on the nodes to be sure but she's saying they aren't big enough to warrant that. My blood work doesn't indicate that there is something wrong with my bone marrow. My bloods are normal and she has ordered a whole host of others to rule out mono, hiv and epstein Barr. My concern really is the groin as the mass is visible to the eye and is around 5cm by 3 cm. If it's not lymph node related then I need to be referred to a gynaecologist or orthopaedic or someone to look at it and say what it is. I am getting pelvic pain and pain radiating down the side of the swelling when I walk over a mile so I really want it resolving to rule anythung sinister out. So alas am not really any further on. Subject to what my CT says if any of the nodes are over 1cm I am going to ask her to biopsy. Not really sure what else I can do !! Report",

She said the groin mass she wasn't sure on (she's not sure if it's related to lymph nodes) but it's in the place where they should be. My smaller nodes near clavicle she could feel them but said they are small. She didn't exam the large lumps at the front of the neck. She said she won't repeat bloods as they were ok and were only done last week (not too alarming she said) but has booked me in for a CT scan next week. I have figured that although I haven't got any answers at least a CT scan will show up what is going on !

She asked me where they where and then when I showed her she felt from behind and agreed she could feel and they were slightly swollen. However, she didn't think they were hard or big enough to cause concern.
