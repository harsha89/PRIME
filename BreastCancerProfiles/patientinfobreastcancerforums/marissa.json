Welcome I have not been here long and have had only one answer to a couple of posts seems a bit slow, I am so sorry to hear about your condition I hope thingss are good for you at the moment, .I had a recall from a mammogram three years ago where they found a lump in my breast I was one of the lucky ones as it was only fatty tissue, the waiting for the results was horrendous so I have a little insight to what you must be feeling, I have a very rare neurological condition and cannot find anyone with the same so I feel so alone at times, if you would like to talk about your jounney I am hear to listen anytime..........................tc......................................M Report",
