      "Content": "Hi Marie, Sorry that you're going through this.  But you did the right thing by going to the doctor straightaway.  Most things can be taken care of if they're caught in time. If you can, try to take things one day at a time.  Please know that I'll keep you in my thoughts and prayers.  Let me know how you get on! xx Report",
