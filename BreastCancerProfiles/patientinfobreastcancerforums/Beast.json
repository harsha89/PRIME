    "Content": "I was started on Levesterole and really couldn't tolerate it at all. Really bad aches and pains but the worst was the loss of any kind of functioning brain! One morning I couldn't remember how to switch on the TV. I was changed to Anastrozole (the generic version) and it's a lot better but still there. Different tablets have different side effects for different people. I don't agree that you don't have a choice. You always have a choice - if you chose to go for a better quality of life over a higher chance of a recurrence, you would have that right. Report",
