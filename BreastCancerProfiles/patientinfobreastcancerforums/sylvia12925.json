Have to wait to see what the radiologist decided once I go see the surgeon mid-month.  Fingers crossed they stay calcified !!

      "Content": "Hoping that this message finds you well.  I came across this site by accident but hope that I can offer some words of encouragement.  I've been dealing with breast cancer since September of last year.  Like you, I was stunned by the news.  On the other hand, I had just started a new job a week earlier and was determined to keep it.  They confirmed I will have a job when I'm cleared to go back to work! Yes, being positive is the key, along with the treatment.  I live in Quebec, Canada.  The medical system is good here.  As far as support goes, family has been there for me.  But again, being positive and not letting this thing take over your emotions and control you is what helped me up to this point.  The fact that you are a strong person to start with is great! Remember you have so much to look forward to, specifically with a grandchild on the way!  This is a bump in the road, albeit difficult, but trust that you will get through it with the love and support of the people around you.  Feel free to reach out, would love to hear how you are doing! Best, S Report hi Sylvia \u200bThank yo for taking the time to message me. I had my surgery last Monday and yesterday returned to find out the results. I'm glad to report that my lymphnodes are CLEAR which is the best news but I unfortunately have to have a second surgery a week on Monday as the margin betweeen the cancer lump and the healthy tissue was a bit too small so to be extra cautious, i'm having to go through the breast surgery again so am upset about that. \u200bOn the whole though I realise this is good news and I WILL beat this. My radiotherpy treatment will now be put back a couple of weeks which is also a bit of a disappointment as I'd hoped to perhaps be through that by xmas. But yes, i have a GREAT-grandaughter coming in March and saw a scan of her the other day and am very excited and determined that there is more to me than my wonky boob!!! I hope you are getting there too and feel better soon. Family & friends will see us through!! \u200btake care and thanku again, Blue :-) Report So happy for you that the lymph nodes are negative!!  Wonderful news!  Yes, I must say that from diagnosis to treatment, (Tx) is not always smooth sailing.  I had a few recalls for procedures that should have been done in one shot.  Coming towards the end now, I can see things a bit differently though.  When you consider how many people are diagnosed with breast cancer alone, its not surprising that oversights occur.  Since we aren't at our best through this journey though, we can't be expected to be patient all the time!  The second operation will soon enough be a distant memory but thankfully they are taking that precaution now.  Rest up and take it easy throughout the radiation Tx.  Its effects are cummulative, (i.e.,fatigue). best, S Report hi, \u200bfeels a bit like one step forward on this journey then 2 back at the moment but off course I want them to be as sure as possibl that they have 'got it' so to speak. I have only the greatest respect for how I've been seen and treated all within a few weeks. Can't fault them at all. \u200bI was told i'd get 3 weeks of radiotherapy mon-fri and i do believe the side effect of the treatment is fatigue. Will this hit me the first week or further on and have you any advice on how to 'prevent' or just deal with that? I hope to drive myself to my daily appointments, is this advisable? thank you Blue :-) Report Your story is exactly the same as mine except I only had to have surgery once. I have just finished 3 weeks of radiotheray and drove to the hospital everyday myself, a round trip of 50 miles.      I only did light house work and walked the dog  Some days I called in to meet my daughter in town for lunch then went on to the hospital. If I had tried to do a lot more I would have been tired,so I didn't. The team at the hospital were great and although some days there was extra waiting time for the machines the staff did what they could and I couldn't fault them. I eat quite healthly and upped my intake to give my body the extra fuel to repair itself. I also walked the dog everyday to stay active. Everyone is different but I couldn't have wished for my treatment to go any better. Now the treatment has finished my skin might get worse this next week, but after that I hope I should be fine. Good luck. Denise  Report thanks for that Denise. Home from 2nd surgery yesterday and i feel ok. Wee bit sore and tired but thats normal. I too have a dog to walk and yes, the daily toddle with him will be my regular exercise! My weeks wait to see if this time the surgeon is happy that he got it ALL then radiotherapy will begin in a few weeks. Your comment is very positive so thanku for that. Stay well and keep looking after yourself!

      "Content": "Hi Sunnysherri, I'm not a doctor but I have just finished treatment for breast cancer (IDC).  The only thing I can say with confidence is that microcalcifications have the ability to turn cancerous.  This is as per the oncologist, radio-oncologist and surgeon and I mention it because I have 4 microcalcifications that were there initially and were not removed for some reason.  They can also appear due to radiation therapy.  They will be closely monitored, however, this is because I've just had breast cancer. That being said, here are a few links I found relative to some of the terms you indicated in your post.  It would SEEM that they ae benign, but the oncologist is your best source and she/he will do whatever tests are required in order to rule everything out.  Knowledge is power and I think doing some reading may help you focus on the positive! http://breast-cancer.ca If you scroll down on this webpage, there is a search bar.  Below are two that you mentioned. http://breast-cancer.ca/papily/ The one above appears to be fairly easy to understand, (regarding Peripheral Papilloma) http://breast-cancer.ca/sclerosdenosis/ Same site again, (Sclerosing adenosis) Best of luck!  Looking forward to positive news!

      "Content": "Hi Lisa43476, Its good advice to not worry and to wait for the results to come in.  I sincerely hope that it is linked to changes in breastfeeding.  On the other hand, I don't how you handle or deal with stress but being logical and preparing for a worst case scenario may help if its less than good news.  I was diagnosed with IDC in the right breast in Sept-2014.  Deep down, I knew what the mammo was going to say.  So I prepared myself mentally......and only had about 4 days to do so before my GP called.  Despite the fact I had done my homework, the news still stunned me.  Now, I know you wanted to hear positive stories so here you go:  I had just started a new job in a new industry 5 days prior to my diagnosis!  Fortunately, my employer said my job would be there when I came back.  Because its a unionized job, I worked crazy long hours in order to attain union status.  I wanted to be sure that I did in fact have something to go back to.  No one needs to have to worry about having a job after going through a year or more of any illness .  I guess what I'm trying to say is, should push come to shove, take the long view.  I swear it helped me get through it.  One of my sisters also helped me enormously.  One of her friends, (who has children) was diagnosed with the same cancer as mine but she was closer to you in age.  She is now cancer free!  Even though I never spoke to her, my sister forwarded my questions and she replied based on what had helped her get through it.  There is a friend of a friend who was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2015.  Hers was rather aggressive and grew fast.  She experienced pain but ignored it at first.  She is progressing well now and last I heard she was ready to start radiation therapy.  She is almost at the end! I have also come to the end, have one more treatment left and have already started a progressive return to work.  Its true appreciation of the little things that help you through rough times.  Friends, family, kids, pets, (my 3 dogs were very important for me in this whole process) can be an incredible source of positive energy. One last thing and perhaps I'm out of line here but if you have the chance of finding a new GP, go for it.  In my humble opinion, he dragged his feet for too long.  Sincere best wishes that your news is good!  Hoping that you update your post! best, Sylvia   Report Thanks very much for your response Sylvia. I am glad to hear you are doing well now and thanks for sharing stories of others you know. I have been trying to prepare myself mentally either way, good or bad news. I understand your point about the gp. I actually saw a different one about the pain in my armpit to the one who referred me for the lump. The gp who referred me for the lump didn't seem to think there was any significance to the pain in my armpit eother though. Maybe because the lump is near my breastbone, but guess we wait and see. I will update you with how I get on, on Friday. Thanks again Lisa Report",

      "Content": "Hi Coffeecup Seems as though you haven't had breast cancer yourself, but theres a family Hx ?  I can't speak to your situation but what Merry stated in her case is similar to mine.  Can only add that Tamoxifen also increases risk of uterine cancer.  This and the fact that its inhibitory percentage isn't as high as the 3rd generation aromatase inhibitors.  The latter, simply stated, works by preventing cancer from using estrogen which it needs to grow. I'm currently on anastrazole/generic brand so cost is lower, (live in Canada and have a somewhat restrictive insurance that insists on using generic unless otherwise stated by a doctor).  Yes, the joint pain and sudden stabbing pains, (not a constant issue) are annoying and make sleep difficult if you move around during the night.  When you go to turn, you wake up and the joint pain tends to make turning incomfortable and slow. Was initially on anastrazole at the end of all Tx and stopped due to the pain as I was simply fed up and and had no more tolerance for discomfort.  Went to Tamox for a year and a bit and went back to anastrazole due to the 100% efficiency, (after discussing with doc) and I figure I'll live with the discomfort for the 5-10 years that I'll have to take the medication rather than go through it all again.  You have to make the choice based on your situation and what you're comfortable with, maybe research both medications to be well informed and for your own peace of mind. Wish you all the best, Sylvia Report Reply",
