      "Content": "Sorry other users have had problems but I'd like to reassure people thinking about taking anastrozole. I'm 52, CA right breast diagnosed April 2007, WLE and axillary clearance, TAC chemo, 30 doses radio and straight on to anastrozole aka arimidex. I went back to the gym after surgery until half way through chemo and then again from start of radio: now doing 3 times a week. My paid work is freelance/part-time and mild/moderate lymphoedema has limited my other activities like DIY, housework etc. I've had minimal side effects from arimidex: stiffness (in hand damaged by chemo) which goes on movement, hot flushes continuing since chemo but getting less frequent and less horrid. I am only tired when I'm bored (funny how my work dried up when I was sick) - when working or working out I'm full of energy. I do get mizzy but who wouldn't with all we've been through, the fear of recurrence and mourning for loss of a healthy body and the lifestyle changes involved. Anastrozole is better protection than tamoxifem against recurrence and has fewer nasty side effects than the 2 other similar anti-hormonals and far fewer than tamoxifem. If you're offered anastrozole, I'd say \\\"go for it!\\\" 1 like, 4 replies Report 1",

I reached under and felt a lump, right between where my breast ends and my armpit begins. I am FREAKED out. I woke up the next day with another lump (I'm assuming these are enlarged lymphnodes.) But this lump is higher up and in the socket area of my armpit. I did make an appt to see my GP but she can't see me tot 2 weeks, so in the meantime I have given myself full blown anxiety since Google tells me all signs point to cancer. Can anybody relate?

      "Content": "I agree, go for it. To every one out there: The essential thing is that the cells removed are tested to see if they are Oestrogen positive which means that they multiply when you have extra oestrogen in your system. Arimidex holds down/blocks oestrigen production (I think). My cell cluster formed after I doubled up on my oestrogen patches (50 to 100) and didn't follow the monthly cycle correctly. My own silly fault, tho I had permission to go for the 100 patch. The adverse effects on previous comments are probably due to lack of oestrogen. I went onto patches due to feeling scatty, forgetful, and deperately wanting to pee. (not due to diabetes). You should try finding a public loo in Europe on holiday. Almost impossible. This \\\"urgency\\\" stopped as soon as I went on patches. The worry is that I will never be able to take oestrogen replacement again and after four years of Arimidex, slight \\\"urgency\\\" seems to be returning. I will wait and see. No aches and pains. Mood swings are hormonal also, the joint pains may also be, but have you been tested for anaemia? A friend with what was thought to be chronic arthritis is very much better after being found to be anaemic. Good luck and dont forget to go for your scans. Report",

      "Content": "Hi Myachinback! Usually, breast cancer does not cause any discomfort or pain or aches. You certainly would not have one mass pop up suddenly, then another the next day. Enlarged lymph nodes do hurt, and will pop up acutely during a viral or bacterial infection. Breast Cancer grows slowly, and is painfree in the beginning. Infections occur quickly and are painful. Have you examined your breasts? A breast cancer mass is hard, fixed, immobile, irregular contour, and painless. A benign mass is mobile, regular contour, can be sometimes sore due to hormonal changes, and change size due to your period. If you have an infection in your hand, such as an infected finger, you can get swollen and painful lymph nodes in your armspit. If you are nursing, and have mastitis, you can also have swollen lymph nodes in the armpit. As I have become older, I have learned not to worry about about stuff. Why, you ask? Most stuff never happens! When stuff happens, it is never as bad as your or my imagination. You are much stronger than you think you are. ( from a former ICU nurse and Nurse Practitioner who survived attempted murder twice, breast cancer, and two strokes, and is thriving!) Best Regards, Merry Juliana Report 3 Reply",

However, a close relative had breast cancer some years ago and now has secondaries in liver and lungs and is having chemotherapy again. I would like to find out about MRI scans to pick up secondaries at an early stage (I believe they are called Hot Spots). I realise MRIs are not offered on the NHS but we feel it would be helpful and wonder why they are not done on a regular basis. Surely it would be cheaper for the NHS to do this than deal with the treatment costs of advanced secondaries. At the moment we do not know if these would be helpful and if so how often it should be done or how much it will cost. Hope someone can advise. 0 likes, 3 replies Report",
