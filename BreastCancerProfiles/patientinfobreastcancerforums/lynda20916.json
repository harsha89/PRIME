Report 1 Thank you, i just wish the letter would hurry up and arrive so i can make an appointment im so worrid of been messed about again as i said i was referred for a ultra sound but radiology cancelled but when they cancelled it they didnt follow protocol and inform my doctors to refer me to breast clinic they just put it in the note but didnt follow it  though so my doctors have made a complain about it but that was 3 weeks of waiting for nothing now back to waiting. Ive googled everything possible, im more scared for my kids i cant leave them yet there to young thats all that keeps me going im trying to be very mentaly strong just in case they say its cancer as i will fight with everything i have but im also trying to keep in mind it mostly likly is something less sinister, i think its because doctors have actually said she needs breast clinic for breast cancer rule out it shocked me abit. hope you are well.
