      "Content": "I have had 4 injections of zoladex with the last one being on 10 December.  Since then I have had severe debilitating headache and into my fourth week off work with it.  In a lot of pain and unable to do much, throbbing headachend nausea when I over do it.  Not having any more injections as directed by GP and waiting for date of hysterectomy. Can anyone tell me how long before the zoladex wears off and when headache should stop.  I have not had any relief at all in over 4 weeks and GP thinks it is zoladex. Have been referred for head scan which is in 11 days. 0 likes, 2 replies Report",

      "Content": "Yep, severe headache is a listed side effect and one for which you're supposed to call doc right away, so good thing you're off it. I can't tell you how long it takes to wear off, but am here to support you on the hysterectomy. I had a total hyst at 27 back in '82. If you want to know more about that, ssy so. Sending you lots of positive thoughts. Report",
