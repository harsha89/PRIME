    "Content": "Yes I was diagnosed in May   I had masectomy as they found 2 tumors which were too far apart to do lumpectomy.  Cancer did not spread to lymph nodes so did not need radiotherapy as it would not benefit me.  They did a further test which is only done in America  to see whether chemo would benefit me.  Thankfully I did not need chemo as my score was border line.  My treatment is therefore letrozole tablets for 5 years and also zoledronic acid which is given by infusion every 6 months.  This treatment is for 3 years.  I am currently undergoing reconstruction which will hopefully be complete later this year.    ?Please remember everyones treatment is unique to them.  So my advice to you is just to concentrate on yourself and listen to your Surgeon My experience tells me they know what they are doing.  If you need any further help please do not hesitate to contact me. ?Good luck.  Report",
