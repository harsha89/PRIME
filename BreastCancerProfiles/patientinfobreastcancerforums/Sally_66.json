      "Content": "Hi Sandra. Had my recall appointment and yes some small cysts were showing in my right breast. I had another mammogram and an ultrasound scan. Happily the consultant concluded that there was nothing causing concern and that the cysts would probably disappear post menopause. They were being super cautious due to this being my first screening and first benchmark. This was a happy outcome but a very anxious wait. I hope this may reassure others and it shows the uk screening programme is being very thorough Andy we should be thankful for that. Thanks for all your reassurance.  Report",

      "Content": "Hi Sally. I know that waiting can be the hardest part so do whatever you can this weekend with your son to keep your mind off of the letter. Often you will receive those letters even in the case of something as simple as a fibroid cyst that had been detected. If you have had previous yearly mammograms and those were all clear, hopefully this is just something simple that can be rectified next week. If it does end up being something more significant, then at least it sounds like it would be caught very early. Try to stay positive and please keep us posted! Report",

      "Content": "Sadly, Gatorgirl, in the U.K. Screening is only offered to 50-70 age bracket but some NHS regions are offering it to women from age 47 and post 70 too. It is, however, a free National Health service so we have to be grateful for that. I did have a trainee do my scan so I'm praying it is a technical issue but I don't want to give myself a false sense of security. Report",

      "Content": "Yes, Sandra, I'm in the U.K. I am being seen on Tuesday. Just feels like I'm on my last weekend of bail before the jury returns to give their verdict. Situation worse as I have no adult shoulder to lean on. Hubby back 10pm tonight. At least having the entire weekend's domestic responsibilities all on myself, I have kept busy. That and watching my son play Rugby in the freezing cold and my usual trip to my mum who is now bed ridden with Alzheimer's. I had a full abdominal hysterectomy 2 years ago. Not cancer, benign fibroids but so large I had a 6 hour operation. My body now feels so good compared to then. I kept my ovaries though so feel good. I have everything crossed. Report",

      "Content": "Do you know if the same standard letter is given to those who have something suspicious in their scan and those retesting due to a technical problem? I had mine done by a trainee but surely if they were saying you need a retest due to a technical problem they should say that and not give you the ambiguity that causes so much anxiety? Of course a technical problem means I'm back to square one - \"unknown\" but that is a lot less stressful than a weekend of wondering if something is seriously wrong. In this day and age why are they not capable of tailoring their communications more. I have no obvious signs even after re-examining myself again and again.  Report",

      "Content": "Hi there. I know being recalled after a routine screening (part of the pre-age 50 group being screened in our area) but I still feel incredibly anxious. The letter was written yesterday and so was waiting on the doorstep when I got in from work. At that time on a Friday all advice lines are closed and I'm left to wait over the weekend before I can talk to anyone. My husband is working abroad unti Sunday night so it's just me and my 10 year old son. I feel so alone. I had no concerns about my breasts and regularly self examined but I'm worried about problems deep within the breast that I can't detect. Any advice is welcome. 0 likes, 16 replies Report",

      "Content": "Cheers Gatorgirl. This is my first ever mammogram. I'm 49 and so part of the screening of 47+ in our area. If I ring up on Monday will they say the reason for the recall or will that only be discussed when I go to the appointment. I was surprised to be recalled as I genuinely had not detected any change. My Mum had a few lumps in her 50s and they were all benign cysts. Bless her she's 83 now and in the latter stages of Alzheimer's. However, she detected her own lumps. It's scary if you think there is something there you have no knowledge of. Report",

But I'm frightened too. I know it might be fine but then it might not be. I'm 49 and this was my first mammogram too. I have no lumps and feel fine but I know you don't have to have a lump to have it. Praying, can't sleep. Since the weekend my breasts have felt more tender. Is that me being paranoid, over examining? Sorry I can't say much to reassure but at least you know you are not alone. Good luck on Thursday. Report",
