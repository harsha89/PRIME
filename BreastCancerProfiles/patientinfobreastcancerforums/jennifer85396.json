      "Content": "My name is Jennifer, I am 50 year old wife and mother going through Perimenopause.  Ten years ago I had my first mammogram which revealed a suspicious mass in my right breast.  I actually had two, one they could aspirate and one was solid, had biopsy and came back benign now have a marker on it.  I have had all normal mammos and ultrasounds for the past nine years.  Six months ago I had my yearly mammo and ultrasound.  Got a letter about two to three weeks later telling me there is area they believe is benign, but I should follow up in six months.  I went today had sono, and doctor came in and said I have two small cysts in right breast.  One of the cycst they can't tell if it is fluid or solid.  I was told the cyst was about 1 mm in size.  If biopsy says cancer they will take out the cyst.  I mentioned radiation and the doctor said we are not at that point I do not think it is anything to worry about.  I am worrying and I reallly need some help .Thank you 0 likes, 3 replies Report",
