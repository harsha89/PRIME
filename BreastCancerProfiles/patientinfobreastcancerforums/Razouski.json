      "Content": "Firstly, really sorry to hear what you are going through and wishing you very well. I found the the following letter in the research. Obviously he is writing doctor to doctor so the tone is upsetting (the science may think possible effects on singing are \"trivial\" but you would disagree!). They did huge trials on Tamoxifen and it seems effects on singing were not flagged up as a side effect. I think it's likely if it were a big effect on a lot of people they would have noticed. That said, this is so central to who you are, I'd discuss with your doctors what they think and ask if there are other treatments which are as good as Tamoxifen but carry no risk of affecting your voice. Very best of luck! caroline here's the letter:  Tamoxifen and the Singing Voice Andrew Herxheimer Citation: Herxheimer A (2005) Tamoxifen and the Singing Voice. PLoS Med 2(9): e310. doi:10.1371/journal.pmed.0020310 Published: September 27, 2005 Copyright: © 2005 Andrew Herxheimer.

Competing interests: The author has declared that no competing interests exist. My remark, in my recent Essay in PLoS Medicine [1], that deepening of the voice occurs with long-term use of tamoxifen for breast cancer needs qualification. Several colleagues have rightly pointed out that the evidence for the effect is less clear than I implied: it comes from women who have experienced it [2], but there have been no controlled studies. A change in voice was looked for and not found among effects spontaneously reported in large trials of tamoxifen, but this was not specifically asked about and might well have been missed. It is also recognised that the voice sometimes becomes deeper during or after menopause, in the absence of tamoxifen. To convey the uncertainty of the facts, I wish to amend my statement as follows: \u201cThe irreversible deepening of the voice that has been reported to occur with long-term use of tamoxifen for breast cancer is an example of a side effect that prescribers, manufacturers, and drug regulators seem to have considered trivial and have not investigated.\u201d Report",

      "Content": "after going to the breast clinic to have routine procedure to drain a couple of cysts, I was shocked to find I had a tumour in the left breast. A subsequent MRI then identified many other areas of cancer in left breast and a benign tumour in the right. Initially I was told the other areas were not cancer and it was only on the day I arrived at hospital for a lumpectomy that I was then informed I would be having a mastectomy. that was a few weeks ago, and I've now been told the only follow up treatment I need is Tamixifen. I'm a little concerned as included in the list of possible side effects is one concerning the voice - particularly for singers. I do a lot of semi professional singing and also teach singing at school and run the choir. Singing is one of the things that keeps me sane (my therapy you could say). I'm finding it hard to find and fast information and wondered if anyone had any knowledge or experience of the singing voice and Tamoxifen. (It may sound silly, but last year I lost my hearing suddenly due to a virus - profoundly deaf in one ear and partial in other- and I had to work really hard to be able to sing in tune when I can't properly hear what's going on. I am so anxious not to jeopardise this) Thanks for any info/ advice. 0 likes, 3 replies Report",

      "Content": "I can understand how your feeling. The not knowing and waiiting around is horrible, and your mind seems to dream up the worst possible scenarios. As others in here have said, it is really improtant to share this with someone, even just one close and trusted friend or family member.  And I can understand you worrying about your family, and feeling \"not ready to leave them yet\". I felt so scared when I got a diagnosis of breast cancer on New Year's Eve and felt very very mortal. However try to remember, even if it is breast cancer, that the majority of women survive breast cancer nowadays and the treatment is swift once you get in the system. Someone else has said about being given a dedicated nurse and telephone contact if you get in the system. They are fab. However, while you're awaiting your appointment you can always phone the Macmillan helpline as often as you want for someone to talk to. Their is 0808 808 00 00. If you live near a Maggies Centre you can always drop in there and talk to someone - they are also fantastic, but there aren't that many of them around. I hope your appointment comes through soon, and wish that all turns out to be quite straightforward. (My mum had a lump in her armpit next to her breast, which was biopsied and was nothing sinister at all, so it may be that it's just a small cyst or fatty lump.) Try to be kind to yourself and find someone to talk to... <3 Report 1 Hi i rang the breast clinic up myself friday as i have felt another lump on the edge of my breast it is only small and probably me feeling to hard i dont know but it freaked me out luckily my partner was there and i told him and he calmed me down as i had a panic attacked which ive never had before but any way my appointment is on thurs morning, im scared but a bit calmer and trying to keep my mind forcused, im praying its a cyst or something. talking on here has really helped and i thank you all for your kind words and its nice to talk to some one that understands Report 1",

I was a 36B until the age of 51 when I had the diagnosis of breast cancer, and have had a mastectomy on one breast and a lump ectomy on the other. So I'm no longer a 36B and actually have no idea what to categorise my size as. If I were still a 36B with no surgery I'd be very happy with my lot.

      "Content": "HI, I had a mastectomy back in January and felt absolutely dreadful about my body, even thought the surgeon had done some reconstruction at the time. The problem being that the reconstructed breast ended up a lot larger than my natural breast (not too mention the shape, scaring and loss of nipple). I was given a partial prosthesis to wear in the natural side so that I didn't feel quite so lop sided (one breast was an A cup the other a generous C cup), and then two weeks ago after much deliberation with the consultant, I had \"symmetrising surgery\". During the consultation before hand he had said that he didn't want to go back into the reconstructed breast to replace the implant with a smaller one as it was liable to infection, and suggested making the natural one match (using breast augmentation). Although all I wanted was to go back to my original 52 year old shape, this seemed like a good option.  All seemed to go well, but I am still in a lot of pain with the new augmented boob, and my nipple is especially sensitive and tender. I'm not sure what to do for the best. When I had my check up on Friday the consultant said it was all great, signed me off, and also said I could get back to exercising including running. Well despite buying M&S's finest ultra high impactbra I attempted one minute of running yesterday and had to hang onto my breast the whole time. Today I am in a lot of pain and not sure if there is anythng I can do, or if this is normal to still be in pain. I know that last time I was in pain for ages, but that was  a much more invasive and extensive op. Just wondered if anyone else has similar expeience or advice. Thanks. 1 like, 4 replies Report 1",

I have actually managed, with a combination of two sports bras, pain relief and holding my breast still with my arm to gradually restart the C25K running programme. I'm taking it gently, but now I'm actually able to run for 25minutes without holding my chest, and with only one sports bra. I feel I'm making good progress in that respect. I have been massaging both breasts, and at last the nipple on the augmented side is beginning to be much less painful. I'm feeling a lot more positive now. :-) Report",

I had a major surgery in a differnt area many years ago. In about a year the pain was all gone.  I am so srry you have to go through al this.💙 Report",

      "Content": "I can empathise with how you're feeling. I had a mastectomy earlier this year. I'm 52 but (surprisingly to my oncologist) am still having periods, so was told I would need to take Tamoxifen. I was really reluctant as one of the possible side effects was changes to the voice (and I do a lot of singing, and had only just got my confidence back to sing more after loosing my hearing 12 months before). I looked at the stats and had various conversations about it. In the end it was my daughters who convinced me (aged 19 and 21), who asked me what I would tell them to do if they were in the same position.  I then started taking the Tamoxifen, and found my periods stopped, I had hot flushes, and worst of all it exacerbated my vertigo (linked to my hearing loss) and made me very dizzy and unstable. The oncologist was really surprised but took me off the Tamoxifen for about 6 weeks to see if my dizziness would improve. It did and my periods returned with a vengeance. Went back and he has put me back on it, and if the dizziness repeats he is going to investigate other solutions either to remove my ovaries or to have monthly injections to stop them producing  oestrogen, so that I can be given one of the post menopausal drugs. It all seems frightfully involved to me, but I know if I don't take something and the cancer recurrs I will really regret it. It's hard all these decisions we have to make. Good luck.
