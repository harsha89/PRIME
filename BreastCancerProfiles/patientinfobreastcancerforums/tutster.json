    "Content": "hello I am living with the breast cancer gene and the reason i was tested was because both my mother and grandmother had cancer. I have regular check ups and mri scans, the only problem is they are a little over cautious and i have had 3 biopsies in 2 years which were found to be nothing. I think if you are worried you can be tested for the gene but if i were you i would stick with just checking them yourself once a week and if you notice anything different go to your doctor and tell him your history. Please dont let it take over your life. Report",
