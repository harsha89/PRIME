      "Content": "A family member of mine has had a mastectomy after being diagnosed with breast cancer. It has been two weeks since the operation and she has a fairly large pouch which has appeared on the side of her body, under the armpit, on the same side as where the breast was removed. It's causing her considerable discomfort and is not reducing in size. It is about 10cm long vertically and protruding 5cm horizontally from where her skin would normally rest. We have been to see her breast cancer doctor and nurse, and they say there is nothing they can do about it. They say that this is not a build-up of fluid which occurs after such a treatment and so can't be drained. (She has been drained where her operation was, in the breast area, and about 200ml of fluid came out about a few days ago.) I have not come across other patients having such pouches appear in the tens of thousands of words I've read about breast cancer and mastectomies. Does anybody know such a pouch appearing under the armpit area and what can be done about it please? Thank you very much. I appreciate your advice. 0 likes, 4 replies Report",

Further to your replies, we'll ask the nurses again if anything can be done. We've raised it a couple of times now, but they just dismiss it saying nothing can be done. Report",
