      "Content": "Hi Amanda, I'm in the exact same position. Got notice of the call back last Friday and I'm in today- my wedding anniversary of all days. I've done my best to keep calm. But I'm frightened too. I know it might be fine but then it might not be. I'm 49 and this was my first mammogram too. I have no lumps and feel fine but I know you don't have to have a lump to have it. Praying, can't sleep. Since the weekend my breasts have felt more tender. Is that me being paranoid, over examining? Sorry I can't say much to reassure but at least you know you are not alone. Good luck on Thursday. Report",
