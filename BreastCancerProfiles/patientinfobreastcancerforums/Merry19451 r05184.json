    "Content": "Dear R, While you definitely need to have the lesion evaluated, and there is always a remote possibility of skin cancer, it doesn't sound like breast cancer. It may have been a sebaceous cyst or abscess (pimple) that didn't drain completely, and now needs to be evaluated. Breast cancers are hard, painless, irregular, immobile masses. If it now is reddish purple, and wasn't before you popped it, that is probably old blood from the trauma of popping it. I am a Nurse Practitioner in the States.
