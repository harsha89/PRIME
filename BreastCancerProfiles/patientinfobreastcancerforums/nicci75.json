      "Content": "Hi Nicci, Sorry you're going through this.  Have you been to see a gp or any doctor?  It seems to me that you might have an infection going on that needs to be taken care of with better antibiotics than you can get at the store. I suggest you go to A&E or to the ER.   Best of luck to you, please let me know how you get on.   Report",
