      "Content": "I would be very wary of radiotherapy if I were you, as I underwent it a few years ago when I had breast cancer, and I believe I had an overdose of radiation. I developed an awful stitch in my side which I still get. When investigated I was told it was damage to one of my lungs due to an overdose of radiotherapy. Unless your mum feels she really needs this radiotherapy she shouldn't just go ahead with it because it has been arranged, does she fully trust the specialist involved? I would look into more deeply as to whether she really believes it's a plus for her. I know if my breast cancer ever came back I would not have radiotherapy, as it badly burned my skin as well as contributing to the severe deformity of the reconstructed breast I had done (besides the botched surgery which had taken place) at Bolton Royal Hospital in Lancashire. Do not just trust the NHS as they sometimes are more concerned as to getting as much useage as possible from these machines than they are about curing the patient! Report",

      "Content": "Maybe she needs other medication than tamoxifen, I would go back to her GP's if I were her, to find out if she may be more suited to a different drug. I know the NHS give that to most women after breast cancer because it is the cheapest option. One of the side-effects of tamoxifen can be blood clots though. I was never given it because of a history of clots genetically and also because I had bad pain in the breast cancer side, although this turned out to be an overdose of radiation. Tell her to go ask her GP to refer her to whichever specialist prescribed her tamoxifen to possibly get her changed to a drug she may get along better with, because there are a number of other drugs that probably could be tried for her condition.
