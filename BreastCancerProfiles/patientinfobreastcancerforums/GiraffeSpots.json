      "Content": "Hi. I really don't know how to tell anyone about the pain I've started experiancing and I would really appreciate some advice. I'm only 20 (21 next month) so I'm quite hopeful that it's not cancer, but I looked my symptoms up online and I'm really scared now. Everything from the sore back I've had for the past five days really seems to point in that direction. My breasts are really sore. I thought it was just pms at first, even though it was a couple of weeks early, but last night the pain got much worse and today it really hurts. It feels nothing like pms now that I've actually started paying attention to the pain. Instead of just a sensitive nipple that hurts when touched, my nipple is the only part that doesn't hurt. There's a sharp pain in my left breast beside my armpit that shoots into the center of the breast and both breasts are generally achey. I can't think of anything in my routine that could be causing this pain as I've been taking it easy with my sore back. I can't feel a lump, but from what I've read both my age and large cupsize would mean a tumour would have to be quite big before I could detect it. All the advice says to seek help as early as possible, but I don't know how. I don't know how to contact my doctor; I still live with my parents and they still consider me a child (I have a bed time) so they haven't really gotten round to telling me how to do things like that. I don't know how to tell my Mum about it. Even thinking about it makes me cry. I know it could be something else, and I could be getting choked up over nothing, but I'm really scared. I know I need to get examined (no matter what it is, it really hurts and I want it to stop hurting) but I just don't know how. 1 like, 8 replies Report 1",
