      "Content": "i have the same thing and it is driving me crazy. I have lots of back issues and after several fusions I have a constant nerve buzzing down my left leg . This sorta feels the same . I worry that it is some artery in my heart that is working overtime . Report Reply hi! mine went away for 2 mon»õhs but now it come back but i feel it more slowly than the first time. i have problems with my back and my doctor said to me that is possible to feel this because of my spine problems. i will have to take a MRI to see what is it. maybe herniated disc and because o that i may feel this strange thing. i hope we all be ok and find out what is it. so if you know that you have spine problems its ok to check it out. the problem may be neurological. Merry Christmas! Report Reply",
