      "Content": "Hi Jenna, Thank you, the diagnosis was over twenty years ago for me at the age of 26 ,showing how long you can live with it. I had the same thing with a later lump I found, where it seemed to disappear, and that one turned out just to be a cyst because my remaining breast is apparently very cystic. I'm pleased to hear that your appointment is tomorrow, let me know how it went if you feel you can. I don't know whether you have tried it, but personally I find meditation is very good to calm me down, as well as burning aromatherapy oils or incense sticks. Sandalwood works for me with an incense stick, and lavender is very calming as an oil at bedtime. When I was going through my cancer treatment I also found lying down with my eyes closed and listening to whale music or rain forests really helped, and now I like sounds of the sea. This has been replaced by meditation and yoga for me now though. I've been learning herbalism which helps too. I even made myself St John's Wort tincture which I am finding really helps me. Maybe something like this may work for you too? Just to warn you though it can cause sensitivity to the sun, not that we need to worry about that right now! Maybe read up about it yourself and see what you think? Or maybe even try chamomile tea which helps me to relax? I would need to know more about you to make informed suggestions which don't contradict others conditions for example. Best of luck for tomorrow Jenna. Report Reply I've just come back from my app with the doctors, she had a good feefeel and check both boobs. She said the lump feel more nodular/gristly but to put my mind at ease she is sending me for a ultrasound which will be on the 21 December, my anxiety Is really bad as been ever since my daughter was killed in 2014 when she was just six so my fear of death is really bad. Ibe got 3 children who are all under the age of 6 so the though of getting something and leaving the. Is too much fornem to handle. But with my anxiety I always seem to jump to the worse case scenario my brain just can't see the other possibilities. I'm so glad you have replied to me xx Report Reply Jenna, I am so sorry for the loss of your daughter. When I stated that breast cancer wasn't the worse thing you could go through in life, you already have experienced it. I understand your anxiety and having breast cancer in relation to your children. Nowhereels gave beautiful suggestions on how to manage anxiety. When I went through PTSD and severe depression after my former husband tried to murder me twice, I was hospitalized as I was suicidal and was on antidepressants and they have helped me tremendously. I was suicidal as I could not get the terror out of my thoughts, could not live with the terror, and hospitalized myself because I wanted to live. I had a four year old son at the time. I listen to beautiful music, surround myself with wonderful friends and family, and saw an excellent psychiatrist to address the trauma in my life. My psychiatrist was excellent in finding the medications to help me and did psycho- therapy. Not every person needs medications for anxiety, but many people who have sustained loss can benefit from professional help regarding anxiety. This is just another suggestion, because I care. I do not believe anti-anxiety medications and antidepressants are bad for you. It is difficult to find the correct ones to help you. FYI: St. John's Wart and herbs are medications, with side effects, just as the prescribed medications from physicians are. I know raising children, especially when they are under 6 years, is a busy time, but if you can take a soothing bath alone, with candlelight, with music. I also did creative imagery, imagining I was at the shore with my family, jumping waves, in the sunshine, with my twin and son! (insert your favorite things to do) Please let us know how things turn out! Remember, if the ultrasound does not show a clear fluid filled cyst, you will need a diagnostic mammogram. A biopsy is the only definitive diagnosis if the ultrasound and mammogram are suspicious. For mammograms, if you need one digital 3-D is the only way to go. Drive longer to get it. As yours is mobile, soft, and changes size, it sounds like it is benign. Best Wishes Merry Juliana Report Reply I'm so sorry that your family suffered the loss of a child aswell.. it's the worst pain I think anyone could ever feel. I'm scared if cars and roads now to the point I will walk the long way to d just so I don't have to cross a road. My little girls called lily she was knocked over by a speeding driver in front of me and her little brother she died in my arms, my depression and anxiety spiralled out of control from there. But the fear of death is so Intenense at the minute. I'm on diazepam, and citalopram. But it doesn't seem to be working anymore xx Report Reply No wonder you are struggling. My brother was run over by a lorry whilst playing on the pavement near his home and it came up onto the pavement, and my father found his body. Back then he had to have shock treatment as it was many years ago. That didn't do him any good to be honest. It effected all of us and my sister and I were overprotected understandably as our parents were always worried it would happen again. My greatest fear when I was diagnosed with the cancer was how my parents would deal with the thought of losing another child and therefore I fought hard, especially as my dad had just suffered a heart attack. What have the doctors said to you about the anti-depressants? I had absolute nightmares with my doctors over the way they treated me with anti-depressants and in the end I slowly weaned myself off them. One of the ones I had was diazepan. I now use alternative methods like those mentioned and its not easy but personally its better for me. I wasn't me on the anti-depressants if that makes sense to you? Slowly I' m coming back and, I've even found a creative side again which I lost for many years thanks to those awful drugs. Unfortunately my condition is such that I can't work anymore thanks to the side effects of the cancer treatment, and the anti-depressants that I should never have been given, but I cope with my alternative treatments. I am learning about herbalism to keep the grey matter going, help myself, friends, family, and anyone else I can. I' m more than happy to take a look and see if we can find some suggestions and free advice which may help your body and mind to heal themselves. I would need to ask quite a few questions to do this though and probably best not on here. I'll warn you that although I'm qualified to advise now its still very new to me and would take me a few days to collate everything properly. Let me know if you do and we will find another way to keep in touch. You will also need to run any suggestions by your doctor to check the suggestions don't interact negatively with anything else that they are already on, or any intollerances, allergies, or illnesses you may have. Take care xx Report Reply I Just wanted to say that I am so sorry to hear about what happened with your husband. I had a ex who hit me and that was bad enough. Your right that some herbal medicines have side effects too and it's extremely important to consider these and discuss them with your doctor before taking any alternative/complementary herbal remedies. I was unfortunate that I was given a brand new cancer treatment, given wrong information about it such as being told I would still be able to have children, but it sterilised me. Now I'm suffering from long term side effects of the treatment which mean that I can no longer digest food properly or keep in the required minerals and vitamins which causes me loads of other physical problems. For years doctors said it was IBS and put me on anti-depressants and were constantly trying increasing and decreasing the anti-depressant drugs by huge amounts because they were not working, and my gastrointestinal problems continued to deteriorate. I was so out of it on the drugs at the time that its not until I paid for my medical notes this year that I saw how wrong their treatment of me was. Due to these massive drops and rises in the drugs, which they should never have changed by these drastic amounts, I even ended up in hospital as an attempted suicide too. Even the paramedics at the time said the doctors should not have decreased the drugs the way they did. I agree they can help but only if prescribed in the correct way for the correct reason. I'm understandably wary of doctors now. Due to the fact that I never actually needed the anti-depressants in the first place, which has now been confirmed by a specialist because I was diagnosed incorrectly and never had IBS, the anti-depressants ended up giving me the actual mental issues that they were designed to cure by creating imbalances. The problem with these pharmaceutical drugs is that when you take an isolated chemical and make a pill which may get rid of a disease or problem it can leave another behind like a dormant virus. Just like my cancer drug which ended up destroying the chemicals in my gut which digest food properly. However if you take a plant that has the same curing chemical naturally, its power will be counterbalanced by other contra effect properties. Thus with a natural plant derived cure there are less likely to be adverse side effects as there invariably are with a pill enclosed drug. I love the fact that herbalism doesn't just look at the illness, it looks at the patients life as a whole. Taking a certain herb may assist the body to heal itself, but master herbalism / phytotherapy is so much more than this. You also look at the food they eat, aromotherapy, and spirituality. My friends and family are coming to me more and more as they become dissatisfied with their present treatments, and not getting any better. I am pleased to say that I am helping myself and them and no side effects to report as yet. Report Reply Dear Nowherelse, I am so sorry of what happened to you. So many practitioners are abysmally ignorant, and fail to listen to the patient, do not look at the adverse reactions of medications, are inaccurate in diagnosis, are arrogant and condescending, etc, etc...I believe in combination of western and alternative medicine to treat the entire person. I am sadly aware of Big Pharm and the Health Industry overtaking quality health care given by dedicated and caring health care professionals. It is difficult to find quality clinicians, but they do exist, fortunately. I am on the Herpes Zoster-Shingles forum and many use Lysine as a supplement and I do the Hi Lysine Low Arginine Diet. It is an extremely active forum. Best Wishes to you! Merry Juliana Report Reply Hi Merry, Thank you for taking the time to message me back. It's nice to talk to people who feel the same way as I do. I am glad to hear that you have found something which works for you with the Hi Lysine Low Arginine Diet. My best friend at the moment is kelp powder. As my condition continues to deteriorate I have found that I am struggling with lack of salt and sugar. When I told my doctor recently over the phone that I felt like this, and that it seemed like I was becoming a little diabetic, he said you will do. The kelp powder is helping me with my salt problems, and I take stevia drops to help with the sugar. They can't help me so I'm helping myself as best as I can. It's amazing what we eat can do for us. Take care of yourself x Report Reply Hi The Nuts and Legumes I was eating were contributing to my frequent severe Herpes Zoster-Shingles episodes. You are indeed what you eat! I am so sorry you have been through so much in your life. Some become bitter, and some learn, evolve and channel their energy to help others. Best Wishes Merry Juliana Report Reply Hi, Thank you, unfortunately there has been a lot more to cope with which I won't go into, but I keep picking myself back up. I have helped so many people in different ways in my life, always putting them first. I have become very spiritual now and I am learning to look after myself too for a change, and the herbalist course is to continue to help me to help others and myself. I'm sorry to hear about the nuts and legumes, I know how you feel because my condition is made much worse with dairy, gluten, and maize/corn. It is so difficult to find things to eat and I have to cook all of my own meals from scratch. I know how many things have nuts in to avoid bless you. I could have a look for any suggestions for Herpes Zoster-Shingles which may help the body to heal itself if you would like? However I am aware that being part of a group you may have already tried most things. Take care Report Reply That would be helpful. Here is my history. I am eating a Mediterranean diet, High Lysine, Low Arginine. I have always cooked from scratch and eat a lot of raw fruits and vegetables. My only supplements are Vit D3 2000 IU daily as my level is 14-16 without it, and Centrum with Lutein, as I am at hi risk for macular degeneration. I also have many IgE mediated food allergies to Sulfites, Nitrites, Latex, grapes mango, cherries bananas, figs, currants, which means I have to be very careful with food packaging. I get anaphylaxis with grapes and wine...and many processed foods contain the food preservatives. I had to figure out these allergies by myself, as the allergist sure couldn't. I do love to drink milk, as it soothes me, although one person on our site thinks it is bad for you, as does the breast oncologist. However, it is great for calcium, and my favorite drink. I eat enough poultry and fish and occasionally beef for protein, because I need protein. I eat grains and am not allergic to gluten. I have had two ischemic strokes due to atrial fibrillation, in addition to breast cancer, and a few neck and lumbar surgeries. I have asthma, atopic dermatitis, and allergic rhinitis, but none is caused by food. Thank you for any suggestions....I do love my dairy products... Best Wishes Merry Juliana Report Reply Thank you for your reply and for being so open and honest with me. You have had, and continue to have, a tremendous amount to deal with bless you. I would love to try and help in any way I can. Yesterday I received my results for my final Online Master Herbalist exam to be informed that I got a distinction and the highest score possible. Therefore I feel ready to asses and suggest possible ways to help your body to heal itself. I need to look at the whole you, physically and emotionally. With this being the case please could you share with me how you feel emotionally at the moment, and describe your current lifestyle. Additionally please could you inform me of any current medication you are on that the doctors have prescribed. It is very important that I avoid anything which could contraindicate them. I will always add here that any suggestions made I would advise that they be discussed with your doctors so that they are fully aware and happy. I think you may also be like me and fully research the suggestions yourself too. which I fully endorse. Also please advise current drinking habits with regards to alcohol. It may take days, even weeks to come back to you with my findings because there is obviously an awful lot to consider with your case. I may also need to message you on occasion for further information. I hope this is ok? I look forward to hearing from you xx Report Reply",

      "Content": "Zoladex Warning Hi everyone, I believe that it is my duty to warn everyone out there about the long term side effects of having Zoladex injections if you have been offered this particular drug. I was given injections of Zoladex directly into my stomach from 0ctober 1996 for two and a half years for breast cancer. I have had terrible stomach issues which began with me often ending up crawled in a ball on the floor with excrutiating stomach pains during the years the drug was administered to me. Ever since this began, on the numerous occasions that I have been to doctors and specialists about my stomach problems I have continually asked if they have been caused by the Zoladex injections but I have always received a resounding no as a response. My symptoms have been like a snowball gathering speed down a steep hill. I now have had to stop working since November and on a good day I have diarreah 3-4 times in a day, up to 11 times on a bad day. I get bad lower and upper back pains, a lot of headaches, I have to wear pads when I go out, I have urinary accidents, if I try to walk too far I get sore and itchy, and I can often wipe and there is blood. I am so malnourised now and losing a lot of weight. This often means that I \"space out\" and cannot take in what is being said or what is happening around me. Luckily I am now being looked at by a specialist who used to work at the Royal Marsden hospital in London. At long last I am being told that they are 98% sure that the Zoladex has caused my condition, but they cannot comment if the correct cause of my conditon not being diagnosed for so long would have given me a different outcome. The top specialist also says that Zoladex is a nasty and aggresive drug. Even if the outcome would have been the same at least being correctly diagnosed would have stopped the doctors giving me the wrong treatment for years. The specialist tells me that my condition is a rare side effect from having the Zoladex injections. However, I would disagree with this statement. From my research I can see that Zoladex was approved for use by the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) in January 1996, and I was given my first injection in October 1996. I was obviously a \"guinea pig\" for the new drug. My first husband and I discussed it recently and we both remember the doctors being keen to push the Zoladex injections onto me, saying that I would not lose my hair and I would still be able to have children with me only being 26. I wasn't really bothered myself, and I had already prepared myself for chemotherapy, but you think the doctors know best. As it turns out a few years later, I was told by the hospital that they were 99% sure that the injections had sterilised me! With me obviously being one of the first to receive this Zoladex treatment for two and half years for breast cancer, I will obviously be one of the first to have survived for twenty years after this treatment. Therefore also one of the first to now show the malnourishment and weight loss effects of being misdiagnosed for so long.  I was previously diagnosed with IBS (Irritable Bowel Syndrome) for years, when all the time I actually had IBD (Inflammatory Bowel Disease) caused by the cancer treatment. I was often treated as if the condition was \"all in my head\" and was given antidepressants which I never needed for many years. One of my major complaints is about these antidepressants. I recently paid for my medical notes and was very shocked by what I read. They started me off with a mild antidepressant, amitriptyline, which I can understand because yes in small amounts this can be used to treat the IBS which they thought I had. However, instead of continuing to look into what was the real cause of my problems, they did a few test and labelled me as IBS saying it was \"likely\". Then as time went on I was given stronger and stronger antidepressants, and lots of problems were caused when they tried to take tme off them too quickly, and then put me on them again. I am naturally a very a strong woman who has coped admirally with many bad moments in my life before I was given mood altering drugs. However, these drugs changed me and actually gave me the symptoms which they were supposed to cure. I was also shocked to see from my medical notes that when I went to see one of my doctors about perimenopausal symptoms that he actually put me down as suffering from anxiety. Even though another doctor gave me treatment for menstrual problems the month before. I obviously was perimenopausal because I have not had a period for years now. Please see the attached article about The Viscount, Luke Montagu. What happened to him in a lot of ways mirrors what happened to me by wrongly being given antidepressants; [b]http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-4173468/My-GP-gave-antidepressants-didn-t-need-20-years[b].html Please make sure that you consider whether you wish to take Zoladex very carefully. Personally I believe this to be a very poisoness drug which needs to be removed from circulation. It may be too late for me now. I am still being tested but the damage may be to great too fix, in which case I will just continue to waste away. I just want to ensure that this does not happen to anyone else. If anyone has any questions that I can help with please do not hesitate to ask.  0 likes, 0 replies Report",

      "Content": "Hi Jenna, I'm sorry to hear about your worries. Obviously you are doing the right thing going to the doctors and all I can do is share my experiences and details of what I have heard to see if this will help. When I was diagnosed with breast cancer I had a lump at the tail end of my left breast under my armpit. It felt very hard and bone like and did not move at all. It was so hard that before I was diagnosed my doctor said it felt like the end of a rib. From what you say yours does not sound like this. As I waited for my results I also had darting pains from the lump to the middle of my nipple. I have been told in the past that it you can pick up the lump and move it then it is usually a cyst. From what you say yours may well be a cyst and I feel this would be more likely. However, I'm obviously not a doctor and therefore your checking it out is the sensible thing to do. I have since had other scares but they turned out fine. I'm keeping everything crossed for you. Take care Report Reply Hi, thankyou for replying. I'm so sorry about your diagnosis. The lump is really strange, some days it seems to be bigger then ItIt seems smaller, I can't seem to pick up the lump because when I do it seems to disappear. I'm familiar with my boobs as I suffer with anxiety so past few week I have actually checked them more than monthly. I'm just absolutely petrified. Xx Report Reply",

I think you may also be like me and fully research the suggestions yourself too. which I fully endorse. Also please advise current drinking habits with regards to alcohol. It may take days, even weeks to come back to you with my findings because there is obviously an awful lot to consider with your case. I may also need to message you on occasion for further information. I hope this is ok? I look forward to hearing from you xx Report Reply",

      "Content": "Hi Tammy, Firstly I would like to say how sorry I am to hear that it is necessary for you to have a mastectomy. I know how you feel because I had one 22 years ago at the age of 26. Back then I have to admit that I was more concerned about mortality and the effect it would have on my family rather than the removal of the breast, but it is a huge thing to happen to a woman, and yes I admit it does have it's challenges. However it is not as bad as you first think. I was lucky in a way and didn't have the chance to worry about when I was going to look at the area where my breast once was. I had a very loose dressing around the scar and the first time I got out of bed after the operation and went to clean my teeth, as I bent down the bandage sagged away from my body and there it was. I remember thinking \"well that's not as bad as I thought it would be\". I had what looked like a long worm across where my left breast used to be which went from under my left armpit to my sternum. The skin was raised to look like a worm due to the staples along the scar. I also remember thinking how neat it was. I believe looking at it immediately was a real positive. It also helped me to go and see a couple of friends of my Mum who had also had mastectomy's before the operation. They were very open and just took out their prosthesis's and showed me their scars. This helped me to become mentally prepared for what was to come. With your friends being in the medical profession hopefully they can point you in the right direction to do the same? The best advice I can give you is to stick to your excercise's once the operation is over to help to regain full movement. It really is worth the discomfort. I decided to leave myself with no breast, unfortunately as a Grade 3 I had to have radiotherapy on the area straight away and therefore an expander was not a option for me. Therefore I cannot advise in this area. By the time an operation was offered I was used to what I had and did not want another scar on my back or stomach area to make a new one. I believe you will be surprised by how strong you will be. It is the wondering that is the worst part. After living with no breast for so long I can give you lots of advice. Keep in touch if I can help. Take care of yourself. Report Reply",
