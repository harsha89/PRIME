    "Content": "Hi Penny, \"Hypoechoic\" can be a characteristic of a solid tumor, either benign or malignant. The size of over one centimeter concerns me. They do not mention any visualization of calcifications or spiculations, which is great, as they are indicative of malignancy. The macrolobulation supposedly is more indicative of a benign tumor than microlobulations, but I prefer to see smooth margins on imaging reports. Have you noticed any increased vascularity (blood vessels) to that one breast? Have you had a mammogram 3D computererized, as well? May I ask your age? Frankly, the radiologist has no way of knowing if a 6 month delay in treatment would affect your treatment. I think he is wrong. I am a Nurse Practitioner in the States who was diagnosed with Invasive Ductal Carcinoma three years ago, had a partial mastectomy, radiation, and am on EXEMESTANE. I used to perform a \"breast clinic.\" When in doubt, I would order a biopsy of the breast mass. The radiologists would be perturbed, as I didn't agree with their findings to wait 6 months. I performed the breast exam, I read the history, I had cared for too many women as they died from breast cancer. When biopsied, a few women had breast cancer. That is the only way to know. I am going to private message you. Best Wishes Merry Juliana Report",
