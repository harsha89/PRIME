      "Content": "I've had a lump on my bra line for a while now. I always just thought it was a part of my chest wall until the other day when I felt it and noticed there was not a bump on the other breast. I called my obgyn and got in for an appointment. She said it was a pimple/sebaceous cyst and she could see it \"coming to head\". Well, I went home and looked and there was NOTHING. No pimple, no head, no mark, absolutely nothing. This lump is small, a little hard, and painless. I am 20 years old and just got an ultrasound of my breasts done this past June. I am wondering if this could be breast cancer and if I should get a second opinion. I want a biopsy but my husband is telling me I should trust my doctor. I don't know how I could trust her if I don't see a pimple there. It's been there for a while I highly doubt it could be a pimple. Especially since there isn't anything there. I'm so worried and upset right now I have been crying constantly because I am so afraid of this being breast cancer. Please help me. 0 likes, 8 replies Report",
