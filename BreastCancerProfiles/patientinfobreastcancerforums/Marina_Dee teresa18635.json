    "Content": "If the lump is smooth and mobile it is probably a fibroadenoma as your gyno has suggested.  She cant tell you it isnt cancer because until she gets the result of the mamogram she doesnt know.    You must attend for the mammogram and ultrasound,so a proper diagnosis can be made. As you have a family history of breast cancer I understand how frightening this must be for you as I have been in the same position myself. Please try not to worry...it sounds as though you are in good hands. Big hug wherever you are.x Report",
