      "Content": "Hi  I had a mastectomy and had part reconstruction may 2017. It takes about 6 months to fully complete reconstruction from having expander fitted during mastectomy operation to having the exchange with the implant. I can honestly say my whole experience was fine. I would also say that I lost my nipple due to type of cancer. I had lobular. Hope this helps. Good luck with your op.  Report",

      "Content": "I've been diagnosed with breast cancer following routine screening 2 weeks ago.  After several biopsies I've been told I need a mastectomy and have to decide on whether I want implant reconstruction or to have nothing and use prosthesis.  It's been a lot to take in over the last 2 weeks and I'm not sure whether to opt for reconstruction or try the prosthesis.  Autologous flaps are not an option for me.  I'm concerned about the amount of surgery required if I opt for implants.  I'd really appreciate hearing from anyone who has been through a mastectomy and had reconstruction implants, or those who had no reconstruction and are managing with prosthesis.  They are pushing me for a decision so the operation can be booked - having implants some time after the mastectomy has not been mentioned but from looking through this site I see this may be an option.  I am seeing the consultant oncoplastic and reconstructive breast surgeon on Thursday who may give me more information/guidance. I also have to decide whether to keep the nipple  in which case they will take shavings and if it has spread I will have to have another operation to remove the nipple, or to sacrifice the nipple at the time of mastectomy.  So many decisions to be made. 0 likes, 2 replies Report",
