      "Content": "I am a breast cancer survivor just very fortunate but I assure you that not all recalls lead to that.  I have been recalled a number of times and in my case it has been what they call a floating lymph node and nothing to worry about or mostly it is a cyst as it was with you. I also have heard that a loss of weight can be a factor. I live in Canada and have yearky mammos maybe because I did have breast cancer.  But if ever they find something suspicious and they check it out and the result is that everything is ok....I still insist on having it checked again in 6 months time.  You have to be your own advocate.  Best wishes.   Report Bless you Marion for your kind response. Whilst Google is helpful it can also have the opposite effect! X Report I agree with you regarding Google.....by the time I`ve finished checking everything I can think of I have frightened myself to death!!!    Praying for good results on Monday....keep us all posted.

      "Content": "Hi, Sorry you are going through this and we all jump to the worst conclusion when we think something is wrong with us and more often than not it`s not always bad news. I think you should tell your Mum and then she can make an appointment for you plus she will be good support for you.  Once you make this first step you will actually feel relieved that you habe believe me.  Not to do anything is not the answer so please tell your Mum and she will get you the help you need.

      "Content": "I have to ask, when you say you \"can`t do it\" is it because by telling it will then lead you to seeing a doctor and that scares you?  Or can you not tell your Mum because you do not want to upset her.  If that is the case is there a friend that you can confide in? Once you have made the first step you will be on the right track to getting the help you may need.    Report",
