      "Content": "Hello Simba try not to worry too much, sometimes the xrays are not clear and they may call you back to get clearer images .. if the xray was fine to start with then surely if it was something of real concern your doctor would be calling you ... Maybe .. i have heard before of some ladies going back / recalled due to need clearer images, as maybe the others were not as good as they could be. try not to worry, i understand your worry though.. try and keep positiveÂ  good luck simbatipps jayÂ  Report",
