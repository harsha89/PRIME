      "Content": "Hi Myachinback! Usually, breast cancer does not cause any discomfort or pain or aches. You certainly would not have one mass pop up suddenly, then another the next day. Enlarged lymph nodes do hurt, and will pop up acutely during a viral or bacterial infection. Breast Cancer grows slowly, and is painfree in the beginning. Infections occur quickly and are painful. Have you examined your breasts? A breast cancer mass is hard, fixed, immobile, irregular contour, and painless. A benign mass is mobile, regular contour, can be sometimes sore due to hormonal changes, and change size due to your period. If you have an infection in your hand, such as an infected finger, you can get swollen and painful lymph nodes in your armspit. If you are nursing, and have mastitis, you can also have swollen lymph nodes in the armpit. As I have become older, I have learned not to worry about about stuff. Why, you ask? Most stuff never happens! When stuff happens, it is never as bad as your or my imagination. You are much stronger than you think you are. ( from a former ICU nurse and Nurse Practitioner who survived attempted murder twice, breast cancer, and two strokes, and is thriving!) Best Regards, Merry Juliana Report 3 Reply",

I want you to know that the medical people who work with breast cancer patients are great. They know how scary this is. My twin and I were diagnosed at the exact same time three years ago with an identical Intraductal Carcinoma, same breast, same time, same markers, same everything. Somehow, because it was caught early, we were not anxious. We both had partial mastectomies and radiation, plus are on Exemestane as the tumors were Estrogen POS, Progesterone POS, Herceptin neg. We had the partial mastectomies due to the calcifications. The tumors were 7mm. There were no involved lymph nodes. I know it wasn't carcinoma in situ, but...we both said, we just wished it was just ourself, so the other twin didn't have to go through it. You will find tremendous support for whatever you do go through, I assure you. If you have the lumpectomy with radiation, I found the best bra to wear is the Bali Cami. BTW, I found that out by asking at the Breast Center where I had my initial mammogram. A lady came out who worked there and told me where to go to buy them. It slips over your head, actually you step into it, because you cannot raise your arm after a lumpectomy, but the microfiber is like silk. I still wear them three years later. You do not feel the bra on you. You join a sisterhood, essentially, helping others through the treatments as you help yourself. Tammy, where do you live? How old are you? I know you will get tremendous care, as all breast cancer patients do. I am a Nurse Practitioner in the States. Please feel free to ask more questions.... Best Wishes Merry Juliana Report 1 Reply",

Those three factors inform me it is not breast cancer. Breast Cancer adheres to the chest wall, is irregular in shape, and usually larger than a pea, when found. I do congratulate you on your immediate follow up with your physician. When in doubt, always check it out. Follow your maternal instincts regarding your baby-child, as well. A mother always knows when something isn't right with her child. Never let a physician be condescending to you! Best wishes with your pregnancy! Please let me know the results of the ultrasound! I have found a lot of breast cancer in women and an occasional man, but it is never freely moveable, nor does it have a smooth contour. It needs anchors for a blood supply, and is growing in a disorganized chaotic manner, which is a description of a cancer. Best wishes Merry Juliana Report Reply",

      "Content": "Dear T, As early as the 6th week of pregnancy, your breasts begin to change. Montgomery tubercles, which are located on the outer rim of the aereola, are sebaceous glands that begin to enlarge in preparation for the pregnancy. Also, you begin to form galactocoeles, or cysts, in preparation for lactation. As your hormones are changing, you can develop harmless fibroadenomas. While new breast masses always need to be evaluated, your body is undergoing huge changes during these nine months. As an anecdote, of sorts, when I was approximately 10-1/2 years old, the American Cancer Society first started having Public Service Announcements about detecting cancers. Naturally, I started development of my breasts, including the Montgomery Tubercles, which were enlarging at that age. I went to my mother, an RN, who sent me to my father, a physician. He handled my concerns so sweetly. I was terribly embarrassed, but he was kind in explaining the development of girls and not marginalizing me. My father's office was in our house, BTW.

I understand your anxiety and having breast cancer in relation to your children. Nowhereels gave beautiful suggestions on how to manage anxiety. When I went through PTSD and severe depression after my former husband tried to murder me twice, I was hospitalized as I was suicidal and was on antidepressants and they have helped me tremendously. I was suicidal as I could not get the terror out of my thoughts, could not live with the terror, and hospitalized myself because I wanted to live. I had a four year old son at the time. I listen to beautiful music, surround myself with wonderful friends and family, and saw an excellent psychiatrist to address the trauma in my life. My psychiatrist was excellent in finding the medications to help me and did psycho- therapy. Not every person needs medications for anxiety, but many people who have sustained loss can benefit from professional help regarding anxiety. This is just another suggestion, because I care. I do not believe anti-anxiety medications and antidepressants are bad for you. It is difficult to find the correct ones to help you. FYI: St. John's Wart and herbs are medications, with side effects, just as the prescribed medications from physicians are. I know raising children, especially when they are under 6 years, is a busy time, but if you can take a soothing bath alone, with candlelight, with music. I also did creative imagery, imagining I was at the shore with my family, jumping waves, in the sunshine, with my twin and son! (insert your favorite things to do) Please let us know how things turn out! Remember, if the ultrasound does not show a clear fluid filled cyst, you will need a diagnostic mammogram. A biopsy is the only definitive diagnosis if the ultrasound and mammogram are suspicious. For mammograms, if you need one digital 3-D is the only way to go. Drive longer to get it. As yours is mobile, soft, and changes size, it sounds like it is benign. Best Wishes Merry Juliana Report Reply",

I had intraductal carcinoma of my left breast, had a partial mastectomy, radiation, and was initially placed on Anastrazole, which I could not tolerate at all. I had deep bone and muscular pain.

I switched to Exemestane, and have aches and pains, but it is toleable. My identical twin, who has the same diagnosis and treatment at the identical time is on Lectrozole, and experiences the same aches and pains. The aromatase inhibitors are superior in that there is no stroke or clot risk, and deliver the same preventative or lowering of recurrent cancer profile. They are more expensive, which is why Physicians promote Tamoxifin. I have had two strokes, so cannot take Tamoxifin. The other issue with all of these is they deplete you of ALL YOUR ESTROGEN, so you are vaginally dry, lose sexual desire, and feel hot all the time. You may feel somewhat depressed. PLEASE, ask any other questions. I am a nurse practitioner in the States. Best Wishes. Merry Juliana Report Reply",

      "Content": "Dear Sheelagh, At the time of the initial biopsy and pathology report during your surgery, depending on the tumor type and grade, ie spread to lymph nodes, the statistics are set. If you had a low grade tumor less than one centimeter, that did not spread to your lymph nodes, you have a much better rate of survival, etc. If your family does not have a history of breast and ovarian cancer, and you do not carry any mutations for cancer genes, your odds are again much better that it doesn't return. Your medical oncologist should have told you your score or likelihood ie percentage of the cancer recurring. That being said, we are not little statistics in charts, we are human beings. If you have reached five years, the odds are looking great for you. We all have concerns that cancer can recur, but I have had other health problems more devastating in my life, and fought back each time and won. Make time to enjoy your life each day as it happens. Take care of your body as the temple it is. Live your life to the fullest. Sometimes, it is better to put your worries aside and just live life. I get my screenings, my immunizations, take my medications, but realized, somethings are out of my control. I have been an RN for 45 years and a nurse practitioner for twenty. I worked in ICU, PACU, surgery, and Home Care in NYC, and seen and felt it all, many of it beautiful interactions. When and if you do experience a complex illness, you need to find the best physician in the best Medical Center. You will never be sorry. My Best Wishes to you. Merry Juliana Report Reply",

      "Content": "Hi Penny, \"Hypoechoic\" can be a characteristic of a solid tumor, either benign or malignant. The size of over one centimeter concerns me. They do not mention any visualization of calcifications or spiculations, which is great, as they are indicative of malignancy. The macrolobulation supposedly is more indicative of a benign tumor than microlobulations, but I prefer to see smooth margins on imaging reports. Have you noticed any increased vascularity (blood vessels) to that one breast? Have you had a mammogram 3D computererized, as well? May I ask your age? Frankly, the radiologist has no way of knowing if a 6 month delay in treatment would affect your treatment. I think he is wrong. I am a Nurse Practitioner in the States who was diagnosed with Invasive Ductal Carcinoma three years ago, had a partial mastectomy, radiation, and am on EXEMESTANE. I used to perform a \"breast clinic.\" When in doubt, I would order a biopsy of the breast mass. The radiologists would be perturbed, as I didn't agree with their findings to wait 6 months. I performed the breast exam, I read the history, I had cared for too many women as they died from breast cancer. When biopsied, a few women had breast cancer. That is the only way to know. I am going to private message you. Best Wishes Merry Juliana Report",

      "Content": "Hi Mr. Usually, a patient has a mastectomy, radiation, then after the tissue has healed after radiation, starts herceptin plus other chemotherapeutic agents that would be effective against her specific tumor type. The medical oncologist receives specific information about the tumor type, markers, and grade. He is the one to speak to regarding your mother, plus include your mother in the discussion. I am conjecturing that your mother's breast mass was large, and they chose to treat it with herceptin prior to surgery. Has it metastasized beyond the lymph nodes, and if so, where? Did her body respond to the chemotherapy with herceptin the first time? How is she physically? Remember, all chemotherapy is poison or toxic to your mother, and the oncologist is weighing all these factors in the decision. I am so sorry your mother has breast cancer. My identical twin and I both have it. Please let me know what happens with your mom. Best Wishes Merry Juliana Report",

      "Content": "Hi Leanne, I am a Nurse Practitioner in the States who used to work in women's health, ie evaluate women for breast cancer. I also have guttate psoriasis, a history of breast cancer-IDC, and was worked up for Paget's Disease. You didn't tell me if you have a family history of breast cancer, history of breast feeding, and your age. You need to be evaluated by a knowledgeable breast surgeon from a University Medical Center, immediately. Call for an appointment Monday, please. Do not go to the Planned Parenthood or local hospital breast surgeon for this. Do you have any masses when you perform a self breast exam? Do you have any enlarged axillary (armpit) lymph nodes? The reason I ask is Paget's Disease is associated with Intraductal Carcinoma, in which you might feel a breast mass. When you have Paget's Disease, as you know, it is usually one-sided. As you have had chronic Psoriasis, I am hoping it is Psoriasis. However, the breast needs to be evaluated by an excellent breast surgeon, pronto. You will feel relief when you take action steps towards a diagnosis. FYI, Oddly enough, when I was diagnosed with breast cancer three years ago, I had no fear. I hope I have helped you.

      "Content": "Elaine, Go to your Gynecologist who will order a mammogram, ultrasound, and perhaps an MRI of both breasts. As your sister died of breast cancer, you still need a breast exam and imaging studies ASAP!!!! Blood tests are not going to show to show breast cancer. If you can't get an appointment with your gynecologist, make one with a breast surgeon, ASAP, who will order the appropriate imaging studies. You are at a much higher risk for breast cancer. My Twin's and my breast cancer were caught early. The mammograms were clear (negative) the prior years, but always had calcifications. The cancers were identical in tumor markers, same location, tumor type, size, time of diagnosis, everything. We had partial mastectomies, radiation, and are on chemo. We have excellent prognoses.

Every woman will vouch for that. Eczema occurs on both breasts. Paget's Disease only occurs on one breast !!!! Breast Cancer does not hurt. Breasts are painful before and during your period. I doubt highly that it is Paget's Disease, as it is on both your breasts. That being said, it is a concern of yours, so I would tell your Mom. The eczema on your breasts needs to be treated, evaluated by a medical professional, and perhaps biopsied. Has your one nipple always been inverted, or is this a recent change? I know that the thought that you might have breast cancer is scary. While I always go with the maxim, \"When in doubt, check it out, \" I feel the likelihood of your having breast cancer is close to zero. I am not minimizing your concerns, however. I had a breast mass checked out when I was 13 or 14 by a male physician. It was benign,. and the doctor was so very sweet and understanding. I couldn't sleep, I was so anxious about it. Please let me know what you find out. Best Wishes to you! Do you have an excellent dermatologist for your eczema? Merry Juliana Report Reply",
