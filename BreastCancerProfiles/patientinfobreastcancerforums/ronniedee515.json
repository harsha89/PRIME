    "Content": "My advice to you would be push your GP to get you an urgent referral for a mamogram and ultrasould.  I went to my female GP in Jan 2014 with a sharp pain in my left breast, never had anything like it before but she sent me away saying it was hormonal, I knew it wasn't but it did go away in a month or two so I forgot about it, then in June 2014 I had an infection in my left nipple, went to my other female GP who said it was an infection and gave me tablets to clear it but she did refer me for a mamogram. As it wasn't an urgent referral it was going to be five months before they could see me so I went private.  I had a mamogram, ultrasound and a biopsy done.  I was diagonised with stage two breast cancer, two small tumors but as they were so deep in my breast it would never have become a lump.  It turned out the nipple infection was not related to the breast cancer so I dread to think if I hadn't had it what would have happened to me.  I do believe that the pain in my breast was the cancer starting and my GP should have referred me then. I had a lumpectomy and 25 sessions of radiotheropy, on tamoxifen now for five years. Insist that your GP gets you an urgent referral, they can do it...Gpod luck.. Report",
