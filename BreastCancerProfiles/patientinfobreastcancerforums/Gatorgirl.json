If she's afraid of what it could mean, she needs to get into the mindset of doing what's best for herself and early detection is key! It may be nothing, but she needs to be her own best advocate when it comes to her health. I think if it were me, I would ask the doctor if I could sit in with them during the exam or at least ask them if there would be an opportunity for you to ask them some questions afterwards. That way, if it wasn't mentioned by her or them, then you'll be able to speak up. It's hard not to worry, I know. But be strong for your mom...hopefully everything will turn out fine. Best of luck!

      "Content": "I'm 46, have had a double mastectomy, had ER+ Stage1 (10.5 mm) cancer in left breast. No family history and BRCA/32 genes tested-no mutations at all. I was advised by my oncologist that because I had multiple aspirations in years past on both breast for fibroid cysts, that it put me at a higher risk for future cancer in the other breast, so that's why I decided on the bilateral. All nodes are clear and I'm otherwise a very healthy person. My question is, I've been told that by taking tamoxifen it will lower my chance of recurrence somewhere else in my body by only a slight amount. I had the I Oncotype DX test done and it came back at 17. Per those results, with Tamoxifen it lowers it to 11%. I consulted with 3 medical oncologists and they all 3 have different numbers. I probably fall somewhere in between. The lowest was approx 12% recurrence after 5 years if I do nothing but lowering it by 4% with Tomoxifen. I've read about all the horrible side effects and I'm truly torn between what I should do. My blood work came back that I am already borderline menopause. I really need guidance! 1 like, 15 replies Report 1",

This is my first ever mammogram. I'm 49 and so part of the screening of 47+ in our area. If I ring up on Monday will they say the reason for the recall or will that only be discussed when I go to the appointment. I was surprised to be recalled as I genuinely had not detected any change. My Mum had a few lumps in her 50s and they were all benign cysts. Bless her she's 83 now and in the latter stages of Alzheimer's. However, she detected her own lumps. It's scary if you think there is something there you have no knowledge of.

Report Sadly, Gatorgirl, in the U.K. Screening is only offered to 50-70 age bracket but some NHS regions are offering it to women from age 47 and post 70 too. It is, however, a free National Health service so we have to be grateful for that. I did have a trainee do my scan so I'm praying it is a technical issue but I don't want to give myself a false sense of security.

It all seems very hit and miss, there are some amazing treatments out there, but they still are not 100% So l think you should take a chance.  I know ladies that have no problem with Tamoxifen, it is like any drug, and we all different with how with cope with the side effects. If you are borderline, then l guess in a year or two they will suggest you change to Aromatase inhibitors,hich are for post menopausal ladies.  There is a  study that suggest it is better to stay on AI's for more than 5 years.  I have been on them for 6 years and will continue for at least another 4 years and who knows could be forever!  I am more than happy to stay on the AI's anything that will give me a chance. l don't want any 'if only l had taken the drugs' if it returns/spreads.
