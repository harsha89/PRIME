      "Content": "I had a mammogram last week and have an appointment for a diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound on both breasts this Friday. In my left breast they found asymmetrical density and in the right a small mass toward my armpit. The wait is killing me. My mother died of breast cancer at 52 and now I'm 40 and have horrible anxiety over this. I had a biopsy of a cyst 10 years ago and it ended up being fibroid. Should I be so worried? 0 likes, 8 replies Report",
