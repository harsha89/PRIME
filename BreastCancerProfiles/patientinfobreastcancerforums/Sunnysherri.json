      "Content": "Hi Sunnysherri, I'm not a doctor but I have just finished treatment for breast cancer (IDC).  The only thing I can say with confidence is that microcalcifications have the ability to turn cancerous.  This is as per the oncologist, radio-oncologist and surgeon and I mention it because I have 4 microcalcifications that were there initially and were not removed for some reason.  They can also appear due to radiation therapy.  They will be closely monitored, however, this is because I've just had breast cancer. That being said, here are a few links I found relative to some of the terms you indicated in your post.  It would SEEM that they ae benign, but the oncologist is your best source and she/he will do whatever tests are required in order to rule everything out.  Knowledge is power and I think doing some reading may help you focus on the positive! http://breast-cancer.ca If you scroll down on this webpage, there is a search bar.  Below are two that you mentioned. http://breast-cancer.ca/papily/ The one above appears to be fairly easy to understand, (regarding Peripheral Papilloma) http://breast-cancer.ca/sclerosdenosis/ Same site again, (Sclerosing adenosis) Best of luck!  Looking forward to positive news!

      "Content": "I'm 50 with no cancer on either side of my family. (Although my 28 yr old daughter is also having issues. Bad looking discharge from her nipple. Told her to get to a doctor ASAP!) Mammogram, ulta sound, syeriotactic core biopsy all came back with more findings each time. They now have sent me to an oncologist. We all know that is a cancer doctor so even more nervous now. This is what they have found. Sclerosing adenosis, Intraductal papillomatosis (Peripheral Papilloma) duct hyperplasia, fibrocystic changes, extremely dense breast & microcalcifications. They said the oncologist will need to do some additional MRI's with and without contrast then talk to me about surgery. And this is where they have left me. Scared and confused. Is anyone familiar with any of these findings and if it means scary removal or just simple, no worry kind of stuff? Please, any help is appreciated. Thank you so much for you time. ~Sunnysherri 1 like, 3 replies Report 1",
