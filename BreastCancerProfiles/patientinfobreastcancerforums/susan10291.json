    "Content": "Thank you for your fabulous post that may deter women from having this useful service. Had I not gone for a mammogram, my 'c' (still can't bring myself to say the word) would still be undetected as it was not palpable. Because of this I am now having life saving surgery on Thursday. I do hope no-one takes notice of your post as it is most DEFINATELY a life saver both to myself and my mum who is a 10 year clear survivor with many thanks to the mammogram. I can't explain how furious I am at the negativity for something SAVING MY LIFE! Report",
