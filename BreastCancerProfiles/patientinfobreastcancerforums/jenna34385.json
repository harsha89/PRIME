      "Content": "Hi, thankyou for replying. I'm so sorry about your diagnosis. The lump is really strange, some days it seems to be bigger then ItIt seems smaller, I can't seem to pick up the lump because when I do it seems to disappear. I'm familiar with my boobs as I suffer with anxiety so past few week I have actually checked them more than monthly. I'm just absolutely petrified. Xx Report Reply",

      "Content": "Hi Jenna, I am glad you are doing monthly breast checks and immediately scheduled an appointment with your physician. (S)He should schedule a diagnostic mammogram no matter what. As your mass is small and mobile, it is more likely a benign mass. Breast Cancer feels hard, irregular, immobile, fixated, often with skin changes such as peau d'orange and puckering, and inverted nipple, and enlarged lymph nodes. I certainly did see breast surgeon for a benign tumor, and it turned out to be nothing. Three years ago, my identical twin and I did have breast cancer, and you know what, it wasn't the worse thing that ever happened to me (us) as I (we)caught it early! I got my screening mammograms yearly, and when available, got digital 3-D mammograms. Our prognosis is excellent. I am a Nurse Practitioner in the States and have cared for many women with breast cancer. I am 67 years old. Please let me know what happens. Best Wishes Merry Juliana Report Reply",
