    "Content": "There is no point in feeling anxious before you get your test results, because there are many varieties of harmless non-cancerous tumours asides from the classic and widespread lipoma. Your doctor just wants to get a clear picture of what your lump is all about, and feels an MRI will be more helpful than any other method to find out. Doctors usually perform a biopsy right away if they have serious doubts you may have cancer. That is what happened in my case; my doctor told me straight off that the lump she touched had about 80% odds of being cancer, and the biopsy came back positive. Good luck, Greg Report 1",
