    "Content": "Hi Diane,Â  First I am here because of the paralells between breast cancer and prostate cancer. Hormone therapy is one paralell. Anyway I shall start a discussion here on the paralells in behavour patterns. I expect that it will be interesting. Now to practical matters. Men too have hot flushes when on hormone therapy. I have found two things helpful in managing my hot flushes. 1) as soon as a hot flush starts I take vigorous exercise such as would raise my temperature to the state the hot flush has brought me. I then actively try to cool down. As my temperature (as I perceive it) drops so my hot flush fades. 2) I take 35 drops of tincture of sage three times a day. Capsules of sage I found to be ineffective. This was immediately helpful and after a month or so the hot flushes became a relatively slow rise in heat. I could then control it by removing some layers of clothes or going to a cooler place. Eleven years - oh my! you have suffered. I hope you find some way to improve it. George Report",
