      "Content": "I'm from India and I had been to the UK for a month for vacation. By the end of that one month I found this lump all of a sudden and I am too worried about it now. It's been two weeks since I noticed the lump which is a little above my right nipple and there is no change in its size and it is painless and it's the size of a grape. It's not movable but just moved under the skin with my fingers and there are no other changes in my breasts other than the lump. Can this lump be caused due to change in place or food or anything like that? What are the chances of this lump being cancerous? Should I wait for it increase in size or wait for it just disappear? Or should I visit a doctor immediately? 0 likes, 4 replies Report",
