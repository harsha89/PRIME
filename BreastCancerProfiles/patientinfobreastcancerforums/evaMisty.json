      "Content": "Sorry this is happening to you.  The gyn is being careful, more careful that the surgeon.  It is possible that a needle biopsy could miss cancerous cells.  They are microscopic after all.  I would suggest that you get your gyn to refer you to an oncologist for a consultation.  Remember, not only do you have a complex adenoma, you also have hyperplasia and calcifications.  This is something that a surgeon would know relatively little about, but an oncologist would.   If there is any possibility of cancer, I myself would want it removed. Best of luck to you. xx Report",
