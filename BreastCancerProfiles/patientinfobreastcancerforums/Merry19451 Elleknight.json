    "Content": "Dear Elle, I am a Nurse Practitioner with breast cancer and eczema. I was just checked out for Paget's Disease, BTW. Breasts get very itchy around your period. Every woman will vouch for that. Eczema occurs on both breasts. Paget's Disease only occurs on one breast !!!! Breast Cancer does not hurt. Breasts are painful before and during your period. I doubt highly that it is Paget's Disease, as it is on both your breasts. That being said, it is a concern of yours, so I would tell your Mom. The eczema on your breasts needs to be treated, evaluated by a medical professional, and perhaps biopsied. Has your one nipple always been inverted, or is this a recent change? I know that the thought that you might have breast cancer is scary. While I always go with the maxim, \"When in doubt, check it out, \" I feel the likelihood of your having breast cancer is close to zero. I am not minimizing your concerns, however. I had a breast mass checked out when I was 13 or 14 by a male physician. It was benign,. and the doctor was so very sweet and understanding. I couldn't sleep, I was so anxious about it. Please let me know what you find out. Best Wishes to you! Do you have an excellent dermatologist for your eczema? Merry Juliana Report Reply",
