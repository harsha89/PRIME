      "Content": "Hello, I'm a African American female, just turned 18. As of lately I had to take amoxicillin to get rid of a ear ache; now a few days later my right breast was very sore, not very sore on what happened & why it is. Now it feels really heavy, I don't think they're any lumps. Just feels really tender & heavy? It looks a bit larger than my other breast. Can someone please help me? I'm worried it might breast cancer. Thank you 0 likes, 4 replies Report",
