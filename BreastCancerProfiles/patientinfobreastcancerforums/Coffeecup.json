      "Content": "Hi Coffee cup! I have not taken Tamoxifin, but have taken two aromatase inhibitors, Anastrozole and Exemestane. The adverse effects are similar, except that Tamoxifin also increases your risk for DVT and stroke, so I was placed first on Anastrazole, then Exemestane. I had intraductal carcinoma of my left breast, had a partial mastectomy, radiation, and was initially placed on Anastrazole, which I could not tolerate at all. I had deep bone and muscular pain. I have had severe Neurogenic pain in the past, kidney stones, shingles, and child birth, but the pain from Anastrazole was unbearable. I switched to Exemestane, and have aches and pains, but it is toleable. My identical twin, who has the same diagnosis and treatment at the identical time is on Lectrozole, and experiences the same aches and pains. The aromatase inhibitors are superior in that there is no stroke or clot risk, and deliver the same preventative or lowering of recurrent cancer profile. They are more expensive, which is why Physicians promote Tamoxifin. I have had two strokes, so cannot take Tamoxifin. The other issue with all of these is they deplete you of ALL YOUR ESTROGEN, so you are vaginally dry, lose sexual desire, and feel hot all the time. You may feel somewhat depressed. PLEASE, ask any other questions. I am a nurse practitioner in the States. Best Wishes. Merry Juliana Report Reply",

      "Content": "Hi,  Does anyone have any experience with taking Tamoxifen as a preventative measure against breast cancer? Im 49, had a hysterectomy 10 years ago, and have a family history of breast cancer. Had a letter from genetics today to explain the figures re the reduction rates.  Thank you for reading this  0 likes, 3 replies Report",
