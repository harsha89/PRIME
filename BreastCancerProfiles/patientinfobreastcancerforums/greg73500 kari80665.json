    "Content": "No, it isn't possible to predict anything before the result of your biopsy is received. The reason it is being performed, is because of the presence of a solid nodule, which raises a red flag. The cysts are no immediate concern, because they are very common benign tumours; However, their evolution will preferably require a follow-up in the future. The biopsy of the solid nodule will determine whether the mass is cancerous or not and the characteristics of the cells extracted. The great news is that even if this nodule ends up being cancerous, it is extremely small at 4mm, so in all likelihood, it means that it has been caught very, very early in its development. And of course, it may also end up being nothing special at all. I wish you great luck, and to not worry whatsoever! Greg. Report Reply",
