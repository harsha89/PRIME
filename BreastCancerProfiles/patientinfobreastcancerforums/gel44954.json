    "Content": "Hi Rachel, I was diagnosed with Invasive ductal cancer 4 years ago. Had chemo first to reduce a 6cm tumour which after 6 rounds of FEC-T had reduced to nothing. Then had Surgery and breast reduction with only 3 lymph nodes removed as a micron was found. Then 20 rounds of Radiotherapy. Mine was ER+ HER2+. You can ask for a second opinion from another surgeon as to whether mastectomy is necessary. I also recommend joining Breast Cancer Care Forum as I met online 45 women going through chemo at the same time. They were a great support and we are all still in touch via a facebook group meeting up annually. We have lost some along the way but you can be sure that we are all a great support to each other even after all this time when it all seems like a bad dream. Â  Report",
