      "Content": "Ok so.. I've been suffering from what the doctors thought was health anxiety.. I've had lots and lots of different symptoms that have been happening since January this year.. I had lots of blood tests and a ECG (I was worried about my heart doing strange things). I don't seem to be getting any better - if anything I feel I'm getting worse.. I went to a clinic on Wednesday just for my pill, whilst I was there I just mentioned to the doctor that my left breast was sore - she examined me and said she would like to refer me to a breast clinic as she felt a lump and thickened breast tissue.. As you can imagine my anxiety is now through the roof!! Are all these symptoms I've been experiencing down to breast cancer?? Not health anxiety which my doctor said?? I have chest pains (more on the left side), very strong aches and pains in both my left breast and arm, extreme tiredness, feeling sick, and also swollen lymph nodes.. I'm am so scared right now!! Any help/advice would be brilliant!Â  2 likes, 3 replies Report 2",

But try to be positive, have had lumps many times and all non cancerous If really serious would of had you in straight away. Fingers crossed for you. Report 2",
