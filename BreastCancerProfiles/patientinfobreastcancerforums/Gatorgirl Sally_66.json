    "Content": "Hi Sally. I know that waiting can be the hardest part so do whatever you can this weekend with your son to keep your mind off of the letter. Often you will receive those letters even in the case of something as simple as a fibroid cyst that had been detected. If you have had previous yearly mammograms and those were all clear, hopefully this is just something simple that can be rectified next week. If it does end up being something more significant, then at least it sounds like it would be caught very early. Try to stay positive and please keep us posted! Report",
