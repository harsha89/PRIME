      "Content": "I believe most oncologists think that a  mastectomy,rather than a lumpectomy is the best option for a good outcome with this type of cancer,but chemotherapy and radiotherapy are still essential to stop any spread.  This must be a shock for you and your family but you must go with what your oncologist has suggested.    Report",

      "Content": "If the lump is smooth and mobile it is probably a fibroadenoma as your gyno has suggested.  She cant tell you it isnt cancer because until she gets the result of the mamogram she doesnt know.    You must attend for the mammogram and ultrasound,so a proper diagnosis can be made. As you have a family history of breast cancer I understand how frightening this must be for you as I have been in the same position myself. Please try not to worry...it sounds as though you are in good hands. Big hug wherever you are.x Report",

      "Content": "No,I havent had a lump but because my mother died with breast cancer I always make sure I get my Mammograms done. I was called back 2 years ago as there were \"changes\",but after an ultrasound and being pummelled like a piece of dough I was proclaimed to be OK.   The ghastly feeling of doom  has never left me so I know how you feel. Just remember not all lumps are cancerous,in fact most aren't.  Another hug to wish you well.  Do you have the appt for your Mammo and ultrasound yet? Report",

      "Content": "Dont be concerned. This happens to lots of women and not only in the breast....you can feel this vibrating/buzzing feeling anywhere.   Its thought to be a tiny spasm of underlying muscles.....like the twitching you can get near the eye,and often associated with being overtired or a bit stressed. Try to get a few early nights. Report Reply",

      "Content": "You really must see a doctor. This could be something simple but it needs checking out properly. it could be an infected cyst coupled with eczema,but nobody on here will be able to give you a 100% definite answer. It may even be something to do with your age and approaching menopause,and oestrogen levels starting to lower and be erratic. Of course you are terrified,all women are frightened at symptoms like this,so do see your doctor ASAP and get a proper diagnosis. Report Reply",
