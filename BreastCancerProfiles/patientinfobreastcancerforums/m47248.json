      "Content": "Please go get a second opinion. I'm personally not familiar with inflammatory breast cancer but I would certainly want to get it checked out by another doctor if it's hard to detect. I would be calling daily until I got an answer from the first doc too. You have to be your own advocate! Best of luck. Please keep us informed. Report",
