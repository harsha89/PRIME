    "Content": "Hi AniD, Breast cancer tumors are spiculated, ie have spikes or points emanating from them. They do not have the smooth margins. They are not mobile. They are firmly adhered to the tissue wall. They are usually painless. The only way to tell for certain is to have breast biopsies. I would have her see an oncology breast surgeon. She might be eligible for genetic testing. BTW, in addition to the current 25 plus known breast cancer mutations for which there is testing, they have discovered 72 more mutations, but tests have not yet been developed.
