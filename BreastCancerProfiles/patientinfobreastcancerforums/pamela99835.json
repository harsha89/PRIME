      "Content": "Hi, I have just had my mammogram as I am 50, have had private ones in the past and all come back clear. However, this letter doesn't say anything about further tests or mammograms, just that the doctor is going to discuss the films and do a breast examination. Â I am really worried, any advice would be appreciated. 2 likes, 7 replies Report 2",
