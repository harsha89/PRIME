      "Content": "This is my history, I'm 46 years old. Summer 2018: Sharp shooting pains and electric shock type pains in right breast. Non cyclical. When leaning or bending a certain way feeling a \u2018pulling\u2019 and \u2018pinching\u2019 pain. Areolas both sides often flaky and itchy. Usually clears up. Clear mammogram in September 2018. One episode of very small dried blood from right nipple (although can\u2019t be certain that\u2019s where it came from) in October 2018. Clear ultrasound on right breast in Nov 2018. April 2019: Intense itching on right breast for a couple of weeks. Two weeks later, (this Friday) extreme pain in right areola. Tender and feeling like a bad bruise. Feels warm to touch. Pain seems to be in one spot near areola. After a couple of days, pain increases to being constant and faint redness radiating from edge of areola to surrounding skin. Hurts to walk around and move arm. Pain decreases when lying on back. Redness has increased although its still very faint. Went to walk in centre today to see if they would give me antibiotics, hoping it's an infection. No sign of infection and wouldn't give me any. Now I'm terrified. 0 likes, 3 replies Report",
