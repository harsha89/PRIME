    "Content": "Hi Tezi, try not to worry too much, tutster is right, do not let this take over your life. I have the same history as you but am much older. I have had regular mamograms for over 30 years now. Twice I was recalled and both times it turned out to be calcified lumps. No Cancer. I have also experienced over this time lots of mastitis pains what the docs call 'breast mice'. ie; lumps that move about. It was all to do with hormones and came and went. I was often terrified and upset over all this. Looking back I wish I'd been a bit more pragmatic about it all. Your GP is aware of your family history. Your mum may have had a rogue cancer that was nothing to do with genetics. I'm also sure if you check yourself regularly and pop along to the docs when you are worried she will be sympathetic and helpful.I have 3 sisters in their 50's, none of us has had breast cancer but have had the cyclic hormonal painsand lumps I mentioned. Get on with your life and take care of yourself, Fanny Jane. Report",
