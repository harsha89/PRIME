    "Content": "Hi Did you  have chemotherapy? I was wondering if your aches from your feet could be from that.  Google Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, I have had lots of problem with my feet since chemo, I had taxotere. i am pretty sure your aches and pains are from tamoxifen, for some reason oncologist seem to disagree, I belong to a breast cancer group, and hear of lots of ladies with the same problems as yourself. Perhaps you could join some of the groups, they may have some suggestions to help with the aches and pains. Report",
