      "Content": "She is going through menepause so her cycle is all screwed up, getting period every 2 weeks with painful boobs which is normal. Then in January she didnt get period for a month but during that time one breast was hurting her. She checked it and noticed a lump. On Feb 4th she had an ultrasound which showed a 2cm mass. I paid and booked our trip to Florida leaving Feb 10. On Feb 6th she gets a call from her doctor not the secretary asking my wife to have a fast track mammo and biopsy on same day, it was scheduled for Feb 12 so I moved our departure to 6 Feb 16. On Feb 17 in Florida my wife called the hospital that morning and scheduled an appointment for Feb 26th the day we would be back. They had told us that it would take 7 days for results and would not say anything when they called us. Late afternoon she gets a call from the hospital from another intern asking her to see her ASAP. My with told her we were not in Toronto and an appointment was booked for the 26th, she said that was too late! But we are in Florida my wife told her, I guess she thought about it and said, \"ok Mrs. Schieda you enjoy the rest of your stay and we'll see you when you get back!\" So we staid until 26th, obviously we had an idea of what the results were going to be! But we stuck it out for the 9 days in Florida as best as we could. We got back and you know the rest...malignant 2cm tumor...surgery this Friday and radiation to follow...hoping NO CHEMO!!! Report",
