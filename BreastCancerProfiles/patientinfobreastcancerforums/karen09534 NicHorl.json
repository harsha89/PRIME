    "Content": "Hi  I had a mastectomy and had part reconstruction may 2017. It takes about 6 months to fully complete reconstruction from having expander fitted during mastectomy operation to having the exchange with the implant. I can honestly say my whole experience was fine. I would also say that I lost my nipple due to type of cancer. I had lobular. Hope this helps. Good luck with your op.  Report",
