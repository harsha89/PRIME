    "Content": "IN 2001 WHEN I WAS 49. I FELT PAIN IN THE BOTTOM OF MY LEFT BREAST. WHEN I SAY FELT, I MEAN, I ONLY FELT IT TO THE TOUCH. I FIRST NOTICED IT WHEN LYING IN BED ON MY TUMMY. IT FELT SIMILAR TO WHEN YOU PRESS A BRUISE. I POKED AND PRODDED AND THOUGHT MAYBE THAT I COULD FEEL SOMETHING, BUT NOT NECESSARILY A LUMP. I ALSO NOTICED THAT MY NIPPLE WAS INVERTING WHEN I LIFTED MY ARM. I TOOK A TRIP TO MY GP. SHE REFERRED ME TO THE LOCAL HOSPITAL. I COULDN'T WAIT THE 2 WEEKS AND SO DECIDED TO SEE THE SAME BREAST SURGEON PRIVATELY. HE SCANNED MY BREAST AND FELT AROUND. HE DID NOT GIVE ME A MAMMOGRAM. HE SAID THAT IT'S NOT CANCER AND ADVISED ME TO TAKE SOME EVENING PRIMROSE. HE SAID IT WAS MOST LIKELY HORMONAL. 3 MONTHS LATER I DECIDED TO REVISIT MY GP AS THE PAIN WAS STILL THERE. THIS TIME I WAITED FOR THE TWO WEEKS TO HAVE THE STANDARD NHS TESTS. A MAMMOGRAM REVEALED CANCER CELLS. WITHOUT GOING INTO TOO MUCH DETAIL. I ENDED UP HAVING PART OF MY BREAST REMOVED, AS IT WAS DCIS. THEREFORE CONTAINED IN THE DUCTS. THE SAME CANCER SPECIALIST AS BEFORE SEEMED FAIRLY SATISFIED THAT THIS WAS ENOUGH BUT ALSO SAID THAT IF I FELT I WANTED A MASTECTOMY WITH RECONSTRUCTION. HE WAS WILLING TO DO THIS. BUT, IT WASN'T URGENT. DURING THE NEXT 6 MONTHS I HAD SEVERAL APPOINTMENTS WITH THE PLASTIC SURGEON TO DISCUSS PROCEDURES. ANYWAY, I HAD A TRAM FLAP OP. THE PLASTIC SURGEON DISCOVERED TISSUE WHICH LOOKED SUSPICIOUS AND HAD TO ALSO REMOVE MY NIPPLE. AFTER RECOVERY I WAS TOLD THAT IT WAS THE BEST DECISION I COULD HAVE MADE AS THE CANCEROUS CELLS WERE PRESENT IN OTHER PARTS OF THE BREAST. IF I HAD NOT GONE AHEAD WITH THIS OP, GOODNESS KNOWS WHERE I'D BE NOW. WHAT I'M SAYING IS 'GO WITH YOU GUT'. IF IT DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT. GET OT CHECKED ND IF YOU'RE STILL NOT HAPPY. GET IT RECHECKED.
