      "Content": "Hi Good Afternoon All.. Today we discuss about, What is use of  Cancer Screening? Many cancer screening tests are in used to find the cancer in an early stage and to lower the chance of dying from the disease. Some Screening tests  have been shown to find cancer early. But, have not been shown to reduce the risk of dying from cancer. So, mostly cancer screenings are very helpful to every one. Thank you.. 0 likes, 3 replies Report",

      "Content": "I went for a routine screening in Aug 2015, aged 50. I had previously had 2 other routine screenings. This time cancer was found in the very early stages. I had surgery and radiotherapy and now take Tamoxifen. I think routine screening is a must and although not save all lives, I'm sure the ones in the early stages that are saved make it worth while and cost effect. Report",
