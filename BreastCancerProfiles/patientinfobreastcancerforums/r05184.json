      "Content": "I had a pimple on the underside of my breast months ago. It popped and there was a bit of white pus, but it's been over 4 months and its still there like a scar or something. It's smaller than a dime, sort of rubbery texture, reddish purple in color depending on the day. Underneath it feels squishy but sort of firm. I've never had a pimple do this. I'm getting it checked but I can't get in to my doctor for almost a month. Does this sound like something I should be worried about? I'm also 23 with sizeable breasts if it helps. 0 likes, 1 reply Report",

      "Content": "Dear R, While you definitely need to have the lesion evaluated, and there is always a remote possibility of skin cancer, it doesn't sound like breast cancer. It may have been a sebaceous cyst or abscess (pimple) that didn't drain completely, and now needs to be evaluated. Breast cancers are hard, painless, irregular, immobile masses. If it now is reddish purple, and wasn't before you popped it, that is probably old blood from the trauma of popping it. I am a Nurse Practitioner in the States.
