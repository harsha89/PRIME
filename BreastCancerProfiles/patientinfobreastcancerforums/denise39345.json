      "Content": "Your story is exactly the same as mine except I only had to have surgery once. I have just finished 3 weeks of radiotheray and drove to the hospital everyday myself, a round trip of 50 miles.      I only did light house work and walked the dog  Some days I called in to meet my daughter in town for lunch then went on to the hospital. If I had tried to do a lot more I would have been tired,so I didn't. The team at the hospital were great and although some days there was extra waiting time for the machines the staff did what they could and I couldn't fault them. I eat quite healthly and upped my intake to give my body the extra fuel to repair itself. I also walked the dog everyday to stay active. Everyone is different but I couldn't have wished for my treatment to go any better. Now the treatment has finished my skin might get worse this next week, but after that I hope I should be fine. Good luck. Denise  Report",

      "Content": "Hi, I was diagnosed in July with breast cancer and had sugery in September. Fortunately they got all the cancer and my lymphnodes were clear too. I have had 3 weeks of radiotherapy and have finished the treatment except for anti hormone tablets which I will have to take for a while.   I feel fine, not 100%, but really good. I have tried to stay positive through as there is not really a lot you can do about the cancer. It is good to talk about it and also on these forums for advise on side effects etc.   Everyone's case is different but the results for surviving breast cancer nowadays is really good so try to stay positive. Good luck. Denise Denise Report",

I was called back and was in the early stages of cancer which was dealt with quickly and efficiently.  I am fine now but would urge you not to worry. Worrying cannot change anything and might create health problems of it's own. Wait and see what happens at your recall and deal with the results then.  Report Reply",

      "Content": "I had breast cancer surgery in September this year and 15 sessions of radiotherapy in October. I felt fine when I was having the treatment although I didn't do much so I wasn't overly tired and my skin was fine throughout.    I do have aches in my arm, but I think that is a combination of the lymph node surgery and radiotherapy. My hosptial was St James' at Leeds and at the moment would go through radiotherapy again with no question. Everyone is different but I hope my reply helps. Report",

I had surgery and radiotherapy and now take Tamoxifen. I think routine screening is a must and although not save all lives, I'm sure the ones in the early stages that are saved make it worth while and cost effect. Report",
