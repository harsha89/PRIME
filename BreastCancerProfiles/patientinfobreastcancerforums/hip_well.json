      "Content": "Hi Liza Sorry to say, it is impossible to say if your friend will make a full recovery. is she Herceptin positive? that usually effects the heart. Until your friend has had a mastectomy, they cannot know the true extent of her breast cancer. I hope she is getting lots of support, there are a lot of groups out there, if she needs any support groups, please ask her to contact me, l can hopefully point her in the right direction.  In the meantime Breast Cancer Care have an amazing forum. Along with an online breast cancer nurse. Report",
