      "Content": "I've only noticed this change around this month of my cycle, though I've managed to successfully terrify myself thanks to Google... More frequently--multiple times a day at that--either one or both of my areolae seem to 'dip' or pull inward. TMI--but the actual nipple isn't an issue here, it's just...the outside portion. I only have sharp needle-like pain in my left breast, and I have an examination for this on Tuesday, but I'm not sure if anyone else has experienced similar to this?? I'm only 18, and I'm /terrified/ it might be the big BC despite low risk. 0 likes, 3 replies Report",

      "Content": "I haven't had the actual exam yet, due to my age they only gave me a blood test and a referral, so I'm still awaiting results. The problem still hasn't gone away, but I have read it might be a hormonal imbalance at best ?? I've also noticed that under my left breast it seems to be lumpy in nature, I only hope it's due to acne or something of the sort... I'll be sure to keep you updated! Best. Report",
