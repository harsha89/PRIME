      "Content": "back to the dr today for the ultrasound report. the report said it was non echoic (?) or vascular or something that meant it had no blood vessels or blood supply. it has no tendrils or funny looking edges so it doesnt look invasive. my lymph nodes are not involved and look normal and the size of the mass is 3mm x 5mm. the ultrasound said \"causes could be fibroadenoma, lymph node or less likely cancer\" still waiting on biopsy results but feeling a little bit more positive than i was yesterday Report Reply",

      "Content": "Hi T! I am a Nurse Practitioner who used to perform breast clinics. I also have breast cancer. Your breast mass is smooth and moveable and tiny. Those three factors inform me it is not breast cancer. Breast Cancer adheres to the chest wall, is irregular in shape, and usually larger than a pea, when found. I do congratulate you on your immediate follow up with your physician. When in doubt, always check it out. Follow your maternal instincts regarding your baby-child, as well. A mother always knows when something isn't right with her child. Never let a physician be condescending to you! Best wishes with your pregnancy! Please let me know the results of the ultrasound! I have found a lot of breast cancer in women and an occasional man, but it is never freely moveable, nor does it have a smooth contour. It needs anchors for a blood supply, and is growing in a disorganized chaotic manner, which is a description of a cancer. Best wishes Merry Juliana Report Reply",

      "Content": "thank you for your response Merry. My husbands mother passed away from breast cancer before i met him so he was adamant i saw a dr right away just to be sure. when my gp felt the lump he said it was moveable but when i feel it, it doesnt feel like it moves at all really. is there any likelihood of what could cause a lump in that location? i will update with results once ultrasound is done. thank you again for your response x Report Reply",
