    "Content": "i am sorry you are in so much pain. Â it is my opinion, only knowing a little about your case, but what the doc did to you is just wrong, forcing you to have yet another surgery. Â the cynic in me wonders if it was done on purpose to make more money or if it was a male doc gratify his needs.Â  Pain goes away after time, several times a day, massage the area with coconut oil where it hurts. I had a major surgery in a differnt area many years ago. In about a year the pain was all gone.Â  I am so srry you have to go through al this.ðŸ’™ Report",
