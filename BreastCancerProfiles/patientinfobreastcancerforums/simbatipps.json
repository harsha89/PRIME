      "Content": "This has got to be one of the most terrifying and awful days of my life so far. I had a mammogram recall today, 40 photographs taken, a biopsy and a titanium staple inserted to alert the surgeon where the area is just in case that they have to operate. Another week to wait for biopsy results and if that's not enough I have got to have a colonoscopy this Friday. I was 50 in December last and since then I feel threatened with these scares and my mental health has taken a huge plummet. I'm totally worn out and yet I cannot sleep. Sorry for the rant but I had to get it off my chest. 1 like, 4 replies Report 1",

      "Content": "Hello Simba try not to worry too much, sometimes the xrays are not clear and they may call you back to get clearer images .. if the xray was fine to start with then surely if it was something of real concern your doctor would be calling you ... Maybe .. i have heard before of some ladies going back / recalled due to need clearer images, as maybe the others were not as good as they could be. try not to worry, i understand your worry though.. try and keep positiveÂ  good luck simbatipps jayÂ  Report",

      "Content": "Hello, can anyone shed some light for me. I'm aged 50 going through the menopause. I have had a recall on a mammogram, I'm absolutely terrified. Five years ago I had a cyst removed via private medical insurance through my employer and everything fine. NHS mammograms since been ok until the one I had a week ago which is the recall. Probably a silly question but I've heard that you can get a recall if you have lost weight between the previous mammogram and the latest one. I have been on a diet and lost over a stone, my cup size has been reduced could this be a amongst many factors of a recall? Thank you 0 likes, 7 replies Report",
