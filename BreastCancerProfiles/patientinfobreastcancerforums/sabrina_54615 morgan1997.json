    "Content": "best thing is to get breast usg done asap. I also got same issue, burning sensation so much so that it even hurt when I use to take shower. got my usg done and it was fibromyalgia and costochondritis. doc gave me evening primrose to take. and within 2 days my symptoms eased off. so don't worry and get yr thorough check up. ur too young to worry abt having BC. don't worry it could be hormonal. keep us posted it after yr usg or any further tests Report Reply",
