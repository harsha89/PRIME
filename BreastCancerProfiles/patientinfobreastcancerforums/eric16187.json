    "Content": "Hi Sid, I had aradical prostatectomie back in november 2014, 35 sessions radiation in 2015 plus Zoladex untill august 2016. Then one year without Zoladex, a year again Zoadex untill a few weeks ago. I'm 64' years young and retired since a few months. My side effects, confirmed by my urologe as being caused by Zoladex are: ?- hot flashes, more or less each two hours, 24/7 ?- pain in joints, may be muscular too ?- If I sit down or lay down even for half a minute, pain all over, but it's over after a few steps ?- Depressive moods, incl suicide thoughts - sexuality sized down to zero ?- All together : not feeling 'normal', not feeling good, not a second all day and night long ?Your question, which preoccupies me as well: how long does it take to get back to normal? ?I guess you have more experience since your last message and I'm keen to hear from you. My experience: ?Feel bad to feeling good: pretty fast. I'd say two weeks. Hot flaches, not sure, three months? Sexual appetite, not sure, three monts? joint pain: ever? ?Please disregard spelling faults etc, I'm native Dutch speaking, second laguage Frech, and then English. ?Cheers ?Eric Report",
