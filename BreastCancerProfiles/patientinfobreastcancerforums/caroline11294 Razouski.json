    "Content": "Firstly, really sorry to hear what you are going through and wishing you very well. I found the the following letter in the research. Obviously he is writing doctor to doctor so the tone is upsetting (the science may think possible effects on singing are \"trivial\" but you would disagree!). They did huge trials on Tamoxifen and it seems effects on singing were not flagged up as a side effect. I think it's likely if it were a big effect on a lot of people they would have noticed. That said, this is so central to who you are, I'd discuss with your doctors what they think and ask if there are other treatments which are as good as Tamoxifen but carry no risk of affecting your voice. Very best of luck! caroline here's the letter:  Tamoxifen and the Singing Voice Andrew Herxheimer Citation: Herxheimer A (2005) Tamoxifen and the Singing Voice.

Competing interests: The author has declared that no competing interests exist. My remark, in my recent Essay in PLoS Medicine [1], that deepening of the voice occurs with long-term use of tamoxifen for breast cancer needs qualification. Several colleagues have rightly pointed out that the evidence for the effect is less clear than I implied: it comes from women who have experienced it [2], but there have been no controlled studies. A change in voice was looked for and not found among effects spontaneously reported in large trials of tamoxifen, but this was not specifically asked about and might well have been missed. It is also recognised that the voice sometimes becomes deeper during or after menopause, in the absence of tamoxifen. To convey the uncertainty of the facts, I wish to amend my statement as follows: \u201cThe irreversible deepening of the voice that has been reported to occur with long-term use of tamoxifen for breast cancer is an example of a side effect that prescribers, manufacturers, and drug regulators seem to have considered trivial and have not investigated.\u201d Report",
