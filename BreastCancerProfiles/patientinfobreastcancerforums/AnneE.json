      "Content": "Well, thank you House... :-) I found this site while just surfing the net about cancer and trying to find out a little more about my path report on my cancer. I let it go, then every now and then something sparks in my head and I think....I must look that up, and sometimes it gets quite interesting...like today. :-) So I try to register into a couple of new forums and see how they work out.....sometimes they do...sometimes they don't....mostly they don't. :-) So I'll hang around for a while and see what happens. :-) Cheers, Anne :-) Report",

      "Content": "Hi Marissa, :-) I feel the same about the site...a bit slow, now sure how long I'll hang around. I've checked out a few sites and many don't seem to have much activity, though I have found one which seems quite good....don't know if I should mention it here, but I'll give it a try...it's called....Cancer Survivors and is American based. I'm getting lots of responses from them and they seem to have a great variety of topics. I know what it feels like to be isolated, because I chose not to have chemo I've really felt on the outter of the....breast cancer...mob...if you know what I mean. Anyway, lovely to hear from you. Cheers, Anne. :-) Report",
