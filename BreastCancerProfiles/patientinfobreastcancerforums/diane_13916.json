      "Content": "Loads of women are called back and it turns out to be nothing. I was called back and was in the early stages of cancer which was dealt with quickly and efficiently.  I am fine now but would urge you not to worry. Worrying cannot change anything and might create health problems of it's own. Wait and see what happens at your recall and deal with the results then.  Report Reply",
