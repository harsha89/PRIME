      "Content": "Hi Rachelle, I'm sorry to hear about your recent diagnosis, but please don't allow the common fear associated with the disease overtake your life. Many people get breast cancer and go on living normally afterwards, brushing off the sad adventure as a typical incident during our physical existences. I am a perfect example of this, as I was diagnosed with Stage 2 Male Breast Cancer, ER Positive, with 4 cancerous Lymph Nodes among 16 removed during the mastectomy, some 13 years ago. I have follow-ups every year and so far, there is not a trace of cancer in my body. The surgery was a great success and all margins were negative, meaning there was no trace of cancer on the edges of the tissues dissected out of my body. To answer your questions, yes, a mastectomy is preferable over a lumpectomy as this decreases the chances that some lonely cancer cells, not detectable at this time in your breast, may decide to reorganize and form new tumors after surgery; by removing all adjacent tissues to the tumor, you are improving your chances for the future. The recommendation your doctors will give you on doing chemo, hormone and radio therapies will depend on the presence and number of cancerous lymph nodes detected during and after the surgery. If there are none, your doctors might just say you can do without these extra treatments. However, if there are many positives, they will likely tell you it is a must to start those therapies ASAP, to prevent the cancer from spreading to a vital organ; that is what I was told. However, after giving it a lot of thought, I decided to take my chances, learn about and treat myself with natural chemotherapy (which is side-effect-free for the great majority of people), at the great dismay of my doctors who thought I was crazy and might be back in the hospital to receive some very bad news within 6 months of my decision. So there it is... you can follow your doctors orders, or, if you are brave and want to do things your way and avoid the potentially damaging or fatal effects of current treatments, you can go and read very interesting things on the Internet and make a clear decision afterwards. If you go the natural way, don't expect your doctors to approve your decision, because they will tell you there is not enough scientific evidence to encourage you. Some cues if you want to learn about natural anti-cancer therapies: You can type up Indole-3-carbinol, EGCG, Selenium, Turmeric and Bromelaine along with the word Cancer (or Breast Cancer) in your search engine, and maybe you will discover some other options to consider. All these substances are available as pills or tablets you can purchase freely without a prescription, and come from food products such as Broccoli, Green Tea, Nuts and Spices in a concentrated form. Eventhough modern research has many convincing arguments about using these products to prevent or possibly help cure cancer, they are not yet approved as conventional treatments by the mainstream medical community. Enjoy reading and best of luck! Greg. Report Hi Greg73500 Thank you very much for your detailed message I will definitely do my research and then decide.  So pleased everything worked out!!  Mine has not spread to my lymph nodes thank god Take care  Report",

      "Content": "I was DX'ed with MBC, IDC, Stage II, 4/16 Lymph nodes positive in Feb. 2005. Following a mastectomy of my right breast and the following pathological examination of my tumour, I was told I should undergo CT, RT and HT. After carefully studying the risks/benefits of the post-surgical treatments, I took the risky decision of not following them. My caregivers, family and friends were extremely worried about that decision, but I simply could not accept the risks of permanent damage to my body, and statistics convinced me that I may not have a significantly increased chance of survival by following the classical course of treatments. Instead, I decided to follow the highly experimental route of studying and undertaking natural treatment options. In effect, I made a human guinea pig of myself, by following a self-imposed regimen of \"natural chemotherapy\" with products for which there was little evidence on humans, but good evidence on lab animals and in vitro. The 4 main natural products I decided to take for the next 2 following years were: 1) Indole-3-Carbinol (from broccoli) 2) EGCG (from Green Tea) 3) Turmeric with Bromelain 4) Inositol Hexaphospate (aka IP6) I am now in my 10th year of survival, cancer-free, with various tests being performed on a yearly basis. I obviously cannot know scientifically if I was cured by the excellent surgery that was initially performed (negative margins), or the combination of that surgery and what I elected to do on my own. Nevertheless, I am still alive to this day and obviously do not regret my decision. I also cannot know if a Met will ever materialize as far ahead as 20 years post-surgery (since I know full well this is a documented possibility), however, I try to look back as this experience as a successful one and I pretty much live as everything from the past was just a bad dream. I'm confident the cancer will never return. I also try to treat every single more minor medical ailment with a natural therapy option - I just cured myself (this time with no possible doubt), of a 20 year Eczema condition deemed incurable by my HCP, with a single natural product. I wouldn't necessarily recommend what I did to anyone. I realize it requires tremendous faith and courage to explore what is pretty much unknown. But I am saying it is possible, if one wishes to truly study his own personal options and accept to take a risk that few wil agree with initially. Report",

      "Content": "No, it isn't possible to predict anything before the result of your biopsy is received. The reason it is being performed, is because of the presence of a solid nodule, which raises a red flag. The cysts are no immediate concern, because they are very common benign tumours; However, their evolution will preferably require a follow-up in the future. The biopsy of the solid nodule will determine whether the mass is cancerous or not and the characteristics of the cells extracted. The great news is that even if this nodule ends up being cancerous, it is extremely small at 4mm, so in all likelihood, it means that it has been caught very, very early in its development. And of course, it may also end up being nothing special at all. I wish you great luck, and to not worry whatsoever! Greg. Report Reply",

      "Content": "There is no point in feeling anxious before you get your test results, because there are many varieties of harmless non-cancerous tumours asides from the classic and widespread lipoma. Your doctor just wants to get a clear picture of what your lump is all about, and feels an MRI will be more helpful than any other method to find out. Doctors usually perform a biopsy right away if they have serious doubts you may have cancer. That is what happened in my case; my doctor told me straight off that the lump she touched had about 80% odds of being cancer, and the biopsy came back positive. Good luck, Greg Report 1",

      "Content": "Oh don't worry about my diagnosis... In fact, it was a great and enlightening experience to survive Breast Cancer for 13 years now! And just to let you know, I also had many tests performed to follow-up on my remission, and at one point, my doctors were concerned I may have developed a potential lung metastasis that had showed up on some X-Rays and an MRI scan, but then dissappeared on another. The equipment offers many great benefits, but it is not always perfect... Sometimes it just picks up \"ghosts\"... an additional reason not to get overly concerned before everything is 100% confirmed. But to come back on the subject of stress, anxiety and potentially-related headaches... We all go through them at one point in our lives for a reason or another... So you may want to read about some great natural products on the Net that may be helpful if your issues persist... Type up 5-HTP or St. John's Wort in your search engine, and if what you read pleases you, you may want to consider them if your issues persist. They both did great for me since I've discovered them, and although no medication is suited for everyone, a majority of people who have also tried them would generally agree. All the best, Greg Report 1",

      "Content": "If you don't feel comfortable taking a particular drug, perhaps both your instinct and intelligence are sending you a message. If you are only trying to prevent a recurrence of breast cancer, there are potentially safer and side-effect free alternatives out there. One of them is called Indole-3-Carbinol. Just type \"Indole-3-Carbinol Vs. Tamoxifen\" in your search engine and enjoy many articles. Just don't ask for a prescription of I3C because your doctor cannot prescribe a natural product that is available freely. I3C comes from Broccoli and other cruciferous vegetables known to have anti-cancer properties. It just hasn't been tested enough on humans so that it can have an official drug status. I personally took I3C for 2 years after breast surgery for male breast cancer over 11 years ago. No side effects then. Cancer-free today. I just can't prove that I3C or any of the other supplements I took had anything to do with my remission. But I did refuse all treatments after surgery: No chemo, no radio and no hormone-therapy.

Report Greg, can you please tell me the other supplements you are taking? Please and thank you... Report Certainly GatorGirl. I was taking I3C, Inositol Hexaphosphate with Inositol, EGCG, Turmeric with Bromelain, Selenium, Maitake Mushroom Extract and countless multivitamins. If I were going through this ordeal over again, I would probably do without the Maitake Mushroom Extract which is likely better indicated to provide immune support after conventional chemotherapy.
