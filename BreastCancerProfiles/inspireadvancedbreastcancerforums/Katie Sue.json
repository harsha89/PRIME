      "Content": "God Bless you for writing such an honest and heartfelt post! Whenever I hear the term \u201cNew Normal\u201d I want to either scream or cry! There\u2019s absolutely nothing normal...new or otherwise about our situation ! I compare the way we now live to living on a roller coaster...and I\u2019ve always despised coasters! I beg to get off and have my old life back. Odd as this will sound, at times, the only time I feel I belong is when I\u2019m at the Cancer Center. It\u2019s there that I\u2019m surrounded by people who know what I\u2019m going through when no one else really does. I try so hard to stay upbeat, but there are those times as we all know. Your blog was amazing, thank you. You have a true gift! Hugs...Katie xoxo 💕💕💕",
