      "Content": "Worriedtoomuch, In February my parents took me on a 16 days road trip from Minnesota to Disney World. We drove because you can't bring oxygen tanks on a plane. I didn't want to be reminded of being sick. As I had spent in the last 6 months before the trip a total of 20 days in the hospital. So we took off with no oxygen tanks, no Walker or wheelchair. Just 3 canes. We drove, saw things along the way, spent time with friends that were in Florida for the winter. Got to Disney World and got buttons saying we are celebrating life. It got us some really cool expensive things for free! My dad ended up getting a motorized chair as he couldn't handle all the walking. My mom used her cane. I needed a wheelchair the day we did Epcot. It was a great trip of memories and tears. I came back home to the \"new normal\". Getting called Grandma by people when I'm with my neighbor kids. I am 2 years older then their parents, but after losing my hair twice to chemo. It has come back gray. Having an appointment everyday for a week with different providers or getting tests. Dealing with government insurance and being told it will stop at the end of the month because I didn't provide requested information. Which comes to, you didn't pay your premium. Which, I have paid it before it was due. I have a provider that comes in to my home for an hour each week and informed me that she doesn't feel that my living condition is safe for me and will have to report it. As my PCA/homemaker is not keeping the place clean enough. Works 27 hours paid a week with me. Takes me to my appointments and does errands with me. Takes up most of the hours. She makes my meals for me as feeling in my hands and feet come go. She stands outside the bathroom while I take a shower in case I fall or need help. Before she leaves, she makes sure all walking paths are cleared. Since Sunday, I have questioned if everything I am doing to live is worth it. Today, I decided after my oncologist appointment to buy some wine. Get home, set the bottles on the counter. 2 yr old goes into the kitchen, hear a crash and 2 yr old is standing by a puddle of wine and 2 broken bottles. Get kids off the school bus, check backpacks, head them off to do chores. Tell oldest child I am leaving for a little bit. Go get meds ready at pharmacy, get watermelon. Then, go and buy 2 more bottles of wine. I start my 21 day cycle of Ibrance tonight. After I have at least 1 glass of wine. So if this is our \"NEW NORMAL \", we should be able to snap at rude people, cry whenever we want, scream I'M HAVING A HOT FLASH FROM THE STUPID MEDICATIONS SO BACK OFF, and when in great pain look at the dear friend, family members or Pastor and state, \"TOUCH ME AND DIE.\" Then start laughing like you've gone mad. It helps alot.",

      "Content": "I love reading your blogs. Totally write a book. I have been told to write one. Just unsure about it. I was diagnosed in 2010 with breast cancer. During treatment my husband decided he didn't want be married anymore and told me to move out. A year later I was told I was cancer free. The oncologist told me he was going to release me and my family doctor could keep an eye out if cancer returned. May 4th, 2018, I had a doctor appointment and could not get rid of a cold. My family doctor did tests and sent me to the ER for a CT scan. The ER doctor contacted a lung specialist and transferred me to a hospital in the twin cities. On May 7th I was told I have stage IV breast cancer that spread to the lungs and bones. They made an appointment with an oncologist that is 45 minutes away from me. She looked at me and told me what the treatment plan was for the next 3 to 5 years. Then, after that what treatment is for the next 5 to 10 years. She looked at me and informed me that she has patients that are in treatment for 20 years so far. She makes treatment plans for patients for at least 20 years. July 4th I ended up in the hospital with dehydration. They transferred me to the hospital in the twin cities as I had a blood infection, my kidneys were shutting down, fluid in and around my lungs, issues with my heart. I almost died. The doctors on my medical team was amazed how well I was doing and they could send me home after a 12 day stay. I am now on the treatment plan my oncologist was planning for me to be on 3 to 5 years from now. However, all is good. I use much humor with everything I am going through. I have been told negative comments when I say I have cancer. They hurt. At the same time I have a wonderful support system. I am single with no kids. I live in income based housing as I'm on disability. My neighbors told my parents that they will be my fulltime caregivers. To help my parents out. A month ago my neighbor guy informed me that he would like to find a house to rent before fall. They have 5 kids ages 12 to almost 2 yrs old. He is looking for a place our family of 8 are in 1 house. As 2 apartments to maintain is hard. That made me cry.",
