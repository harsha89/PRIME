      "Content": "Hilltopper Judy has provided a good summary and you definitely will find good support here when you have questions. I am on Letrozole only (after some spinal surgery and radiation). I have been relatively stable for almost 6 years and despite some minor side effects continue to be able to enjoy life. Good luck to your daughter and to you. I often think it is harder for our family (especially Mothers) to keep positive with this disease but with support you will find it a little easier to adjust to a \u2018new normal\u2019. Best wishes, Linda",

      "Content": "We have all been at the place where you are now - confused, shocked and not sure what's ahead. Believe me, it will become easier with further understanding and (hopefully) information provided by your Oncologist on Monday. I was diagnosed in 2013 (Stage 4 from the outset). Doing well so far on Letrozole (I did have some spinal surgery to remove the met which was quite large in my Thoracic spine, followed by radiation). Don\u2019t rely on old stats that you might read from the internet - we are very fortunate that research is moving at a fast pace and prognosis have improve exponentially. If you contact BestBird on this site (send her a direct message) she has very kindly and thoroughly put in great effort to compile a a comprehensive guide which she has recently updated. See BestBird\u2019s post of February 19th - BB will send it to you, upon request. There is a table in the Guide (page 35 - \"Conditional Survival\") which provides hope for us all re the updated stats resulting from much improved treatment protocols over the last couple of decades. For example, a stat that continues to give me hope is that the one that states \"At 5 years already survived MBC, the probability of five MORE years of relative survival of 56.9%\" based on 2010 statistical analysis; however, \"A more recent study of conditional survival in breast cancer data from SEER examined cases that were diagnosed during 2000-2008 and followed up through 2013 (states that) \"Specific to distant breast cancer disease, the analysis indicated that five-year relative survival was 30%, and that the improvement in 5-year relative survival from diagnosis to five years already survived for distant disease was 91.4%\". Thanks BestBird!! Hope this provides you with some comfort and hope - something we all need. Good luck with your new normal!",

Below is an extract of BestBird\u2019s post providing her email contact: - hope this helps: Greetings, When contending with an initial diagnosis, treatment change, or side effect, it can be quite difficult to obtain current science-based information. When I was diagnosed with MBC in 2011, I began researching the disease and its treatments and shared my notes with other patients. In 2015 I organized everything into a .pdf entitled \u201cThe Insider\u2019s Guide to Metastatic Breast Cancer\u201d that I continually update and have forwarded free of charge to more than 3,100 patients and caregivers worldwide over the past 4 years. Those interested in receiving a copy may email me at bestbird@hotmail.com I\u2019m delighted to say that \u201cThe Insider\u2019s Guide to Metastatic Breast Cancer\u201d is now offered in paperback and eBook format on Amazon at https://www.amazon.com/Insiders-Guide-Metastatic-Breast-Cancer/dp/179586060 X/ref=sr_1_fkmrnull_1?crid=2EL3W64I1UXA0&keywords=the+insider%27s+guide+to+ metastatic+breast+cancer&qid=1550509998&s=gateway&sprefix=insiders+guide+to +me%2Caps%2C684&sr=8-1-fkmrnull",

Good luck and don\u2019t ask random doctors for their prognosis - just keep on as best you can with a positive attitude - sometimes easier said than done, I know.",
