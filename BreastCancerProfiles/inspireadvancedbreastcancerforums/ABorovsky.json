    "Content": "Thanks for this. My husband sent me an article the other day from an Israeli newspaper and while I think the multi-pronged approach makes sense, there was so much information missing. What type of cancer cells did they treat in the mice? To just say we can cure any type of cancer with no side effects is questionable at best. And as most of us probably know, the fact that it works in mice doesn\u2019t mean much when it comes to humans. Let\u2019s see how a Phase I trial goes. Unfortunately, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we never hear of this again.",
