    "Content": "I think the hardest decision has to be making the decision with my colorectal surgeon, that doing any corrective surgery to correct problems my surgeon made during my colonectomy, was very tough. The decision not to do anything like remove the rest of my colon to get rid of the cdiff that has plagued me for 3 1/2 years would possibly cause more serious infection, the incision would have to be cut out, and the two sides of the belly brought together, means more scar tissue, on and on. Making the decision for all this, then even redoing ostomy to other side for better stool flow, gain brings possibility of serious infection.Any other repairs, are not in the cards for me. It's such a big disappointment, and I could have a blockage in the transverse where my ostomy is hooked up...will find out what the xray showed when I see him next week.. but the chance of even further damage and serious surgery, infection, and long recovery just isn't in my future. I live with the ugliest flabby, deep incision anyone could have, I am praying FMT would someday be in my future to cure my cdiff that I got in the hospital during surgery or hospital stay. It just is all too upsetting to even talk about, but being able to let others know what can happen if you get a terrible surgeon, is more NB important to me than keeping this to myself.",
