      "Content": "I have been dealing with bone mets for almost 2 yrs. The onc started me on instance/faslodex, then AI, then Xeloda. They didn't work for me, but others do very well for years on them. Then I went to IV Taxol that worked for 7 mos. Dr is giving me a break for a month bc of side effects. I have been no progression or new tumors for over a year. When diagnosed I felt the same way you are feeling. It does get better. You will too, there is a period of depression. My Dr said the bones can hold more cancer than the organs, and tend to do better than when there's organ involvement. Trust in the Lord!",

If your active you probably will do ok with exercise. I'm moving on to liposomal Doxorubicin. Almost forgot....my hair started thinning so I shaved it off. It started growing back in! So don't be too quick to shave it off! Good luck, I'm sure you'll do fine.üíïüôè",
