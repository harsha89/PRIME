    "Content": "As a former nurse and too frequent patient, my focus is on nursing care. Nurses should have fewer patients and less busy work so they can focus on what they are trained for: implementing care and monitoring for changes in patient condition. There should be more transparency in costs. Doctors should be more available to teach patients and actually see with their own eyes how their patients are responding to treatment. A culture of respect for staff and patients should be maintained by the hospital and people behaving in disrespectful ways should be counseled. An example of this is the doctor who speaks rudely to nursing staff or patients and families. More chaplains and counselors available to help support the emotional and spiritual needs of patients, families, and staff.",
