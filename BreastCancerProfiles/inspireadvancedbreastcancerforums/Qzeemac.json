We hear so often about new treatments yet when I try to read the articles about them it's either too technical for me to understand or so dumbed down it doesn't really contain any useful information. Thank you for writing in language I understand (mostly). I really appreciate you and the efforts you make to keep us informed.",

(I wouldn't have told my 89-year-old mom about my recurrence, but she lives with us and her dementia is still mild - she hears and sees more than I think - it would be hard to fool her about all the appointments, etc.) So, enjoy your brunch. There's nothing to regret - your decisions are being made with love.",

      "Content": "I've had bouts of depression myself, but I've been lucky enough to have them dissipate after a few days. Finding my way out of one of those bouts isn't always easy or predictable - sometimes I just wake up one morning stronger and more hopeful than the day before. (Wish I knew the secret sauce for that - I'd bottle it and give it away to anyone who needs it.) Unfortunately, we have to deal with a problem that can't be solved, just managed - a reality that's tough to face. I'm so glad you have a wonderful family (me, too - I'm very blessed). You can lean on them. Trust your friends, too - they probably understand more than you realize. You might feel isolated, but there's a lot of us out here ready to listen and sympathize. I'm in North Texas or I'd suggest meeting at Starbucks and indulging in one of their decadent frothy drinks while we talk. Since that can't happen today, know I'm thinking of you and wishing peaceful days ahead for you. Take good care of yourself Hugs Susan",
