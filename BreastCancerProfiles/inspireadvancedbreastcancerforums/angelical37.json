I completely understand how u feel, I fell into a depression, at the point I just lay in my bed after work and cry behind close doors.. I feel like my life expansion has been cut, the new normal is hard for me to kope with, I don\u2019t want to buy anything new cause I\u2019m afraid everytime I get a test done it\u2019s not good news, to worry about blood work, pet scans, if chemo is helping and the day you hear that you have no more options for your cancer is frightening to me.. stage 4 is another new kind of normal to accept from the stage 2 I went threw.. I will always fight and Never Give up by all means.. I have two kids and a grandson I want to be there for as long as I can.. I had to cut /shave my hair again yesterday back to wearing scarves, so now comes the questions from people that suppose to be your friends or family.. I feel like I don\u2019t want anyone to see me, only because of the questions..I have to learn to live life I will never be the same with CANCER but I have to remain strong to fight !

My onc said it\u2019s a chronic disease, not s death sentence, I literally think about dying every min of the day, it was so bad I thought about taking my own life.. I am not on any depression medication at this time ,I tried Zoloft it only made me sleepy for a hour..I read so many stories good and bad..My mind only thinks about CANCER..How do I kope with this reality ? How do I go back living my normal life ? I have two kids and a grandson that means the world to me, I will Never Give up and will fight this terrible disease ! Depression is a very serious illness.. I tried to get help with the hospital advocate, that was a total disappointment.. I felt as if I was begging for help.. I talked to her one time and never heard from her again..I come here because I consider inspire to be my outlet, people understand especially when it comes to Cancer... Hopefully I can get some encouraging words or positive stories from tnbc survivors... I feel like I\u2019m in a totally dark space..",
