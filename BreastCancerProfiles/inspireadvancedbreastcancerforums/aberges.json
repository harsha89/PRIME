      "Content": "Hello everyone. I've just started my 3rd cycle of Xeloda 2000mg twice a day. 7 days on 7 days off. My palms and feet are starting to itch. And the nausea is really severe. Even with taking Zofran 30 minutes prior to taking the xeloda. I've also been using Udderly Smooth on my hands and feet everyday. Xeloda is my third treatment. MBC with mets to multiple bone sites. Any suggestions will be appreciated.",

      "Content": "Thank you, Denise9991, for sharing your experience. I've been using Udderly Smooth throughout the day and Aquaphor at night also. I've tried taking my dose with my meal and after and I still feel the same either way. I see my onc this week and will go over everything with her as well. Will get my scans next month and hopefully this treatment is working as this is my 3rd medication since diagnosis almost 3 years ago.",
