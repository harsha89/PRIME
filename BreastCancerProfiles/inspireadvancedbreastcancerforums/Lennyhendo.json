    "Content": "I had a similar experience. Left side implant that had radiation encapsulated so had it removed and at the same time had the right breast removed, as I was not interested in another implant and did not want to be lopsided. Luckily my surgeon was very supportive and she had no issue with my request (2016). Even though my recovery was not straight forward as I had infection, it was definitely the best decision for me and have no regrets about being flat chested at all! A whole lot easier and more comfortable.",
