      "Content": "pambayer, by way of reminder, I'm the one who suggested DS 8201 for your daughter. It should not cause hair loss and side effects should be mild. The drug is targeted, so does not affect all cells, should just target cancer cells. Makes a big difference with side effects compared to traditional chemo. I sent you a separate message with some information, hope you received it. Best of luck with the tests. When will your daughter start the DS 8201 trial? Again, wishing her a very quick response and please keep us posted. If I discover anything that might help her, I'll post it immediately. I have had a lot of experience with cancer treatments and as a survivor, really agonize over patients getting the best treatment. You're a wonderful advocate for her! ---Minnie",

      "Content": "Thanks, lpburwell, my husband is a doctor and concurs with you that all side effects are listed, because no one will ever know if what a person is going through is related to that specific drug or not. If someone is taking too much Vitamin A and doesn't report it during the trial, that person might experience more hair loss than most. I did experience hair loss on all treatments I've tried for the past 36 years, and for traditional chemo, it was only partial, for targeted drugs it was minor. Lucky me! And for some, no hair loss at all. One relative, on 24/7 chemo for one year, lost no hair at all, when most people lose all their hair. A doctor friend lost just a little on the same chemo and he did it for a year. So it is individual. No worries about being a Debbie Downer, as they say, it is better to be prepared than surprised. All the drugs in trial will show side effects known to date on the labels or sites, so the important thing is we are all different, and all experience different effects, so sometimes we have to exchange a chance at life for a little more hair. And if there is hair loss it usually comes back. So all should hang in there!",

      "Content": "Not sure if McKenzie lost hair with TDM-1, she tried it, I believe it failed and she is now going to try DS-2801. It appears that reported hair loss in TDM-1 patients are less than DS 8201 to date, but TDM-1 has been around longer so has more statistics. It went through clinical trials prior to FDA approval in 2013, and we now have an additional 5 years of statistics to add on to that time frame. DS 8201 isn't out of clinical trials yet. I went from loss of most of my hair on top when doing taxotere infusions, and then taxotere failed, I went on to TDM-1. I'm happy to say all my hair grew back, somewhat thicker than before (my dermatologist was so fascinated with hair loss statistics while on chemo that he cataloged my progress with photos). He confirmed that the before and after results conclude I'm one of those people who were lucky, my hair is situation is doing very well. My doctor reported to me that if TDM-1 fails for me, DS 8201 will be next. Since DS 8201 currently shows higher hair loss statistics, even though it has not been around as long as TDM-1, I glad I didn't donate my wig after taxotere. Choosing the right one can help a lot, it saved me a lot of time and I had so many ask me for a referral to the stylist who did the cut and color. Made my husband smile, he knew the secret. All is not lost. Even a little hair. Hang in there!",

      "Content": "Julesxx, wonderful news! Hopefully the elevations are just inflammation, but if not, kudos to you for jumping on exploring additional treatment. I had a slight elevation recently and the bloodwork was repeated and it had gone back to normal range, likely I picked up a minor bug. I've heard gamma knife works really well. Wishing you the best!",
