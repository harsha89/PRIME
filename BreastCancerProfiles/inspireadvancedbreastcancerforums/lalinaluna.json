    "Content": "Hi Beth, I'm on Kadcyla since November 2018 every 3 weeks and I was never given Dexamethasone. I had Docetaxel with Herceptin before where I had to take steroids. When brainmets showed up September 2018 I got steroids for inflammation due to Radiation and the cancer. Maybe every country has different regulations (im based in Australia) I'm slightly nauseous , but that's gone by day 5 and nothing compared to other chemos I had. Steroids will increase your blood sugar, which I try to avoid as well. During Radiation they were a blessing though!! Much Love Angelina",
