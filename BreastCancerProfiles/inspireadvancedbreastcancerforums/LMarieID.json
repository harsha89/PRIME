    "Content": "I have noticed the same. My triggers are chocolate and Chinese food. For me the queasiness and nausea have subsided the longer I am on Verzenio (150mg, 2x day). Never took anything for it. It does give me terrible heartburn though, as did chemo. As long as I take daily Prilosec (omeprazole) all is good. It helped with the nausea too. The diarrhea gets better also. Lab values have been a little low but stable. Verzenio has been an easy drug for me and seems to be working. Dropped tumor marker over 500 points in 5 mo. Wish you good luck on it! Hang in there.",
