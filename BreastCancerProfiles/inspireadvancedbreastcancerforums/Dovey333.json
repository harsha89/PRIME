    "Content": "Hi there. My lobular breast cancer returned after only two and a half years in remission. I did not do chemo or radiation.total right breast mastecomy .My oncologist put me strictly on faslodex and no others. After nine months there is no evidence of disease. The oncologist says a woman who is my same age which is 65, is going on her fourth year of no evidence of disease just being on the faslodex. So I am looking forward to getting as much out of this as I can. The side effects from the faslodex for me are achiness in my legs and muscles. And initially it was hard to get up from a sitting position to walk but I have worked through a lot of that and I barely have that side effect now. I was one of the rare 2% of lobular that goes to the stomach and the colon. That was a rough time and I lost 30 lb because I couldn't eat. I am back on track but the 30 lb back on plus some LOL. My heart goes out to you but know that if somebody says the average just know that we're not average for Fighters Edited March 5, 2019 at 12:36 pm",
