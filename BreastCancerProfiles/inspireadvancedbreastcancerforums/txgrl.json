After 10 years with innumerable Mets I just want to be here next year. They really do not give people enough warning about the level of hair thinning ibrance causes. I have had that too. every time I see those commercials with the ladies talking about what a big fight they're going to put up with their beautiful long hair or they are young and pretty and look great in a scarf I just want to scream.",

      "Content": "The side effects I had from Eribulin were low white counts and neuropathy which caused muscle wasting most noticeably in my hand, but also my feet, which was alarming to say the least. The Neulasta I took for the low white counts caused the bone pain. I had taken Neupogen in the past and thought Neulasta would be the same, but it was the shot from Hell. I now use Zarxio which is a biosimilar and it seems to work well with less pain. I had mixed results on my scans, some things better, some worse, some the same. I have had several different treatments over the last ten years, so I already had some neuropathy prior to starting Halaven.",
