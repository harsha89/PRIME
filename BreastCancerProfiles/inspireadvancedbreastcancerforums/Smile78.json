    "Content": "I have been on Ibrance 125 mg and Femara 2.5 for 2 years without progression. Sometimes I have diarrhea with the Ibrance and some fatigue toward then end of a cycle. I nap for about 30 min. in the afternoon and that helps. I have not had to skip any doses or lower my dose. The Femara does make my joints hurt somewhat but it is all very tolerable. Hang in there! You have every right to have the feelings you are experiencing but take heart! There are many, many people do very well on a wide variety of treatments.",
