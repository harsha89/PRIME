      "Content": "I live my life in thanksgiving and gratitude. I stopped listing my treatments and clinical trials because it\u2019s too much to keep up. It takes effort to do that at times but many people with or without cancer have their own issues they deal with. I have several friends who have lost their battle with this disease and if there is anything I learned from them it\u2019s this. Don\u2019t let cancer become who you are. As for the Home Depot guy he was rude no excuse. He could have apologized Each day you live is another day for chance at a good day. Today we have so much more available to us than our sisters before us. Don\u2019t get me wrong there are days that my mind wants me to listen to poor me, but I try hard to focus on the blessings I have.",
