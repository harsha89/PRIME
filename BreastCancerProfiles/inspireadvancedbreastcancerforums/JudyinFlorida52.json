      "Content": "I sure hope you get a lot more time on the Ibrance! I\u2019m on Afinitor and Exemestane since 12/28/18. On 2/1, one of my tumor markers dropped significantly. But, I\u2019ve had low grade temperatures, and very bad pain in my sides. I spent a day in the ER last week and not a thing showed up that could be causing it. The ER doctor was on the phone constantly with my oncologist. I\u2019ve tended to experience rarer side effects with the various medications. And I\u2019m thinking this is possibly one of those instances. So I\u2019m determined to tough it out! Blessings!",

      "Content": "I\u2019d like the big pharma lobbying to end. As much as I\u2019m for less regulations, the drug pricing basically eliminates many who could truly benefit. If I weren\u2019t working and paying for really good medical coverage, and if I were on Medicare, my oncologist told me it would be $2300/21 days out of pocket. My oncologist must have provided my contact info to an organization that helps with copays for Xgeva. When they called me, the first question was, and I quote \u201cAre you on Medicare because if you are you won\u2019t qualify for this program.\u201d",

      "Content": "I couldn\u2019t agree more! Mouth sores, fevers, and the fatigue! My skin changed and my hair completely changed texture. Let\u2019s put it this way, if I was out of Brillo I could use my head to get that stubborn baked on food off the pan, lol. Also, coworkers saw the commercial and questioned me because I had to work from home while on it. The risk of infection was too great where I work. They saw the commercial and thought I was having a good ole time at home! Ibrance stopped working for me after 2 years, however, despite the side effects, I\u2019m hugely grateful it was available for me. That said, the vast majority of the almost 9 years at Stage 4, have been relatively normal. The past 2 years have been a very trying \u201cnew normal.\u201d",
