If I understand you speak of cellular vaccines where manipulated dentritic cells are injected to the patient ? If it is so the problem is that it requires an advanced technology which is only available in very specialized centers. The use of vaccines made for instance with peptides or mRNA can be much more widespread.",

This is the first clinical trial with the association of vaccine and checkpoint inhibitor for metastatic TNBC. According to my knowledge there are at this time 5 clinical trials with vaccine and checkpoint inhibitor on various cancers. I hope this will confirm for TNBC the results obtained by the such a combination (including GMCSF !) and which saves lifes and more particularly the life of my wife at this time.

      "Content": "This is indeed good news because it will obviously improve the treatment of metastatic TNBC. However the complete remissions in IMPassion 130 are only at 3 %. I believe the following case is therefore interesting. Independently of a clinical trial 4 patients with metastatic TNBC and with the tumor cells from the primitive tumor expressing PD-L1 have been treated with anti PD1, chemotherapy and a peptidic vaccine against survivin plus GMCSF. 2 patients, including my wife are in complete remission. My wife after 32 months treatment and the other one since 1 month. I agree statistics are impossible with 4 patients, but I consider this could trigger some thinking . My wife had abraxane and keytruda and the other ones had a different chemotherapy and opdivo. The treatment of my wife was initiated in 2016 when we had knowledge of the phase 1 of IMPassion 130 from december 2015 which gave 40 % of response for 24 patients. My wife was before resistant to the first line chemotherapy and metastasis were progressing quickly. I do not know if there are clinical trials for metastatic TNBC including abraxane, anti PD-1/PD-L1 and a vaccine. According to litterature vaccine could improve the response by up regulating MHC, improving the activity of cytotoxic CD8 lymphocytes, facilitating the CD8 lymphocyte penetration in the tumors. Nevertheless a peptidic vaccine did not improve the checkpoint inhibition therapy of metastatic melanoma, but different cancers could have different responses to immunotherapy.",

I still remember when he initiated IL2 for the treatment of kidney cancer more than 20 years ago. It was a revolution. 2) the cellular therapy worked wonderfuly for her brest cancer (was it TNBC?). This treatment with TIL is highly sophisticated and gives great hope. However, taking into account its sophistication, it will probably take time before it can be applicated routinely. In the time to come I believe that there will be more likely improvements of IMPassion 130, such as vaccine or targeted chemo, that showed that TNBC responds to the combo chemotherapy checkpoint inhibitor.",

      "Content": "I agree with you. Research is progressing and a stable disease may in addition offer new opportunities in the future with new treatments. However the complete responses show the very powerful action of immunotherapy when it works. Long term complete remissions with chemotherapy for metastatic TNBC are very exceptionnal and then deserve publications. We know that tumor are heterogeneous and therefore it is difficult not to have some cell compartment resisting to chemotherapy. I do not know how the cytotoxic CD8 lymphocytes cope with heterogeneous tumors when immunotherapy is working very well, is it a whole population of lymphocytes acting on various tumor neo-antigens, is it what is called epitope spreading ? May be immunologists will tell us. I thank you for your wishes for my wife. When we were told the result of the pet-scan in august 2016 after less than 2 months treatment it was difficult to believe it, even if we had some hope with immunotherapy.",
