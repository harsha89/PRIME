      "Content": "Are you saying a little cancer should be left in the lungs to prevent reoccurrence? For my reoccurrence, I tool Alectinib for 5 weeks until CPK too high. The CT results, performed to see why I was short of breath, showed it completly wiped out a new tumor in my left lung. Now there is only a small place that may still have cancer in the pleural of the left lung, which was treated in 2012.",

      "Content": "1). I would suggest that hospital have a certified team of experts who can drawn blood and IV from people on the first stick and insert and IV on the first stick. I have beem stuck as many as 8 times for one stick by several different people. Most tell me they only stick twice before they ask fo help, but they go get someone that still only sticks twice, finally they bring in someone that gets the stick their first time. How hard are you to stick? should be on the check in sheet. 2). I suffer from insomia. When I just dose off they come at 4:00 AM to start trying to stick me again. There are many tests that can be diagnosed with a meter, using a finger stick, but the hospital rarely uses these. Why not? 3). Have a quite time for patient in rooms. Where there will be no loud conversations of nurses or visitors or banging of equipment out in the hallways. I have been in the hospital for 4 -5 days at a time and have not had a wink of sleep until i went home! this cannot be healthy. 4) Don't pretend that the Social Worker is there to be a patient advocate. She is the doctor's advocate and if you ask the doctor too many questions she comes and threatens you with dismisal. She also is only interested in how you are going to pay. She/H pretends that she is a counselor when she IS NOT certified as a psychiatrist.",
