      "Content": "I got 42 cycles out of I/L... the last 39 at 75 mg. There is post-marketing evidence that the results are nearly identical across all three doses. Based on cell biology and how these meds work, you will get more benefit from being able to complete full cycles and starting the next cycle on time with a lower dose than skipping doses or delaying the start of the next cycle. Go for it! Plus, you may find your fatigue is less. Quality of life is important too.",

      "Content": "I looked into this trial last summer. It uses atezolizumab (a PD-l1 inhibitor, a type of checkpoint inhibitor) plus any number of targeted therapies. I really liked a few of the arms-- I did not have \"measurable\" disease so I couldn't enroll. Ate alone is not the most promising of immunotherapy meds, but in comb with one of these targeted medications it may have some efficacy. I'd seriously consider it...I can't do it now that I have measurable disease since I had Xeloda as my most recent treatment, and one line of chemo in the metastatic setting is not allowed per enrollment criteria...so I'm trying to get into a nivolumab (PD-1)/ipilibumab (CTLA-4)/bicalutamide (anti-androgen) trial....should hear any day if I am in. Hopefully one of these immunotherapy combos proves effective against ER+ MBC.",

I've been on it since September with very tolerable side effects-- no GI problems, mild hand/foot symptoms. I hope you are successful in convincing your onc to switch you to this-- although there's nothing to prevent you from doing it this way on your own. I get my CBC and CMP labs drawn at random times-- sometimes at the immediate end of the 7 day \"on\" week, sometimes at the end of my 7 day \"off\" week-- and those labs are almost identical every time....unlike with the CDK4/6i meds there doesn't seem to be 'telltale' lab results that correspond to being on or off the medication at the time of the lab draw. Let us know how it goes with your onc. Elizabeth Edited May 1, 2019 at 10:01 pm",
