    "Content": "I have been on IBrance and Letrozole since Sept, 2016 for my ER+ MBC too. Last July my mri showed a new tumor on my pelvis and leisions on my spine. I stayed on the IBrance and Letrozole and didn't make any other changes to my diet or my other medications or vitamins. In November I had an ultrasound and the tumor and the leisions were all gone. It is now March and another ultrasound is still showing no tumors or leisions. I'm only one of us, but that's my good fortune story. Hope this helps in your decision-making process.",
