      "Content": "Shoo foo, So glad you convinced them to not include it! I\u2019ve had it with various chemos as well, horrible, can\u2019t sleep more than 3 hrs first two nights following treatment. I\u2019ve been able to get it reduced from 10 to 5mg, but they won\u2019t let me eliminate it. Currently on pills, but maybe I\u2019ll push a bit harder next chemo lol! Good luck to you! Nancy",

      "Content": "I was on Halaven from Oct 2017 to Dec 2018. I have mets in my liver since 2010. (been on nearly everything now). The Halaven was very tolerable actually. My hair did thin out considerably & was very grey and frizzy, the neuropathy did get worse in my toes however (I do take L-Carnitine which is supposed to help against neuropathy) and just a little constipation now & then. My PET/CT in Oct 2018 showed original lesions shrinking considerably and very minimal metabolic activity-awesome result there but it also showed two new spots growing as well, had to biopsy those to confirm still breast cancer and yes,that\u2019s what they are. Kind of weird combo of results, so I switched to Navelbine in Jan 2019 and now awaiting my next scan next week. My hair is growing in now on the Navelbine too. Good luck with the Halaven. Nancy",
