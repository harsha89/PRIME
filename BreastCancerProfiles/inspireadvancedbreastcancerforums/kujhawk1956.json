    "Content": "So, improving the quality and access to my medical records through the patient portal. The summary my urologist posts after each consult is pretty much worthless, does not summarize the key points, questions, results, answers and discussions about what to do next. Throughout my chemotherapy treatments my oncologist never posted any notes, a year after I completed my treatments they took down all the lab results. Often I find that even though a nurse took my vitals and medical history (yes, I had the Shingrix shots, pneumonia and flu shots too, yes, tetanus...but my health history in the portal reflects none of tha! Mayo probably does the best job of the various portals I use. Some day I would envision a single medical records system with tabs for each hospital, practice where patient and physicians with the appropriate access protocols can go in and enter, see lab, tests, imaging, surgical notes...rather than today\u2019s helter skelter system that places the onus on the patient to track down and provide pertinent medical records to their medical team.",
