    "Content": "I've been following many topics on this forum for my daughter who has been fighting BC for 9 years now. She has had 2 remissions. Most recently she was using Taxol low dose, and seemed to be doing pretty well. Her scans were looking good and was about ready to come off. Then all of a sudden she had some numbness and went in for and MRI and found that she had Leptomeningeal metastases. Thing took a very quick turn for bad when she had so seizures . Long story short, they started Methotrexate and we moved her to Boston to try to get her into a trial https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02939300 . Turned out they couldn't get her stable enough for the trial, so she will likely come home now. Chemo is known for spreading secondary cancers and is probably what happened here.",
