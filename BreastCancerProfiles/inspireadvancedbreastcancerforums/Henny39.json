    "Content": "Ladies I may have to start TDKM1 or Kadcyla as my tumour markers keep increasing. I have Er positive and Herr 2 positive BC in bones and I have had stable scans for 4 years however my tumour markers continue to increase so I am trying a new hormone therapy for 3 months and if that doesn\u2019t work kadcyla is my next line of treatment. I am just wondering if any of you have experienced side effects and could you go to work on it? Appreciate the advice, Kind regards sinead x",
