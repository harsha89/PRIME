      "Content": "Hi there and welcome to Inspire. Sorry you have the need to join but I have found it a useful site. I\u2019m in between Glasgow and Stirling, where are you? I\u2019ll write again as kids just down and pile of ironing to do but I tend to look on here most nights. I\u2019ve been metastatic for two half years. I\u2019m her2 and hormone positive,deducing you are hormone positive? I get where you are coming from. My feeling is it\u2019s probably from your hormone drugs, i\u2019m only on zoladex but at times i feel miserable on it. No oomph yet physically keep quite well on kadcyla, though i do notice on weekends like this when i had it on Friday and have had the kids to entertain all weekend (hubby is on nights) i\u2019m tired and easily stressed. I imagine if i\u2019d felt like this as result of a natural menopause I would have been to the GP asking for HRT!. I\u2019m 49, so not many friends at this stage yet. Anyway you will read from some very inspiring, knowledgeable and uplifting people on this site so I hope it\u2019s useful to dip into and as i say I\u2019m happy to chat with you anon. Anne",

      "Content": "Hi Beth, that seems a pretty high dose for anti emetic purposes over a period of days. I can\u2019t exactly remember dose i took for lymphoma chemo but i definitely relate to feeling \u201cwired\u201d then. Now for MBC I\u2019m on Kadcyla but have luckily never needed pre chemo anti emetic cover so yes you can do it without the dex. I only occasionally need a little metoclopramide so i\u2019m lucky. Could they look at increasing your zofran dose instead. Must be some new anti emetics out there now, all these drugs were around when i worked in oncology 20 years ago! Hope you get something better to suit and that Kadcyla is beneficial for you once again Anne x",
