    "Content": "Louise, I am from the USA, and completely agree with you. In a for-profit system, in is difficult to help each other as we would all like to do in clinical trials, etc. We may offer our DNA, but know we have no control over who gets helped with the information rendered. We know that drugs and treatment available will only be affordable for some people. People take part in trials and still that doesn't qualify them to have affordable access to any treatment derived that used their information. If we had an ethical system, non-insurance company/profit based, I would be the first on line to donate anything needed for all the other humans. To give information so a company profits, while others literally die while being denied cutting edge treatments if they have the \"wrong\" insurance (or potentially have the information used against them)- not so much. Not very inspiring. Discussion of the healthcare system should underlie questions of donating samples. We hold great power in this- precision medicine requires participation, and we can change the system with our participation-or lack of. I",
