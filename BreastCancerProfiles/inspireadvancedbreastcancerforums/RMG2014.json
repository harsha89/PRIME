      "Content": "Thank you, Fightterm, for posting this. I\u2019ve been interested in vaccines for a long time and was considering going to a clinic in Mexico that creates a vaccine using dentric cells. Fortunately, I was able to try Keytruda and thank G-d it\u2019s working. But I do think vaccines could lead to a cure. :) Randie",
