    "Content": "At my mammogram in 2015 I found out I had cancer so had the biopsy that day. The woman who was doing it said she had stage IV liver cancer and she was the happiest she had ever been. Still in shock I said yeah well I was pretty happy yesterday. Then within a week after all tests found out I was stage IV. The first oncologist was very matter of fact, no bedside manner and said well you know what this means. We try things, it keeps popping up until we run out of options. I felt like it wAs over but walked out and never went back to her. Went to a well known center and have been happy with treatment since and doing ok. I think it\u2019s all in how they say it and staying positive! Wish you all the best!",
