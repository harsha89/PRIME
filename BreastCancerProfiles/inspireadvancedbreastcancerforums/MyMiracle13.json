I\u2019ve not known of others here who have mets to mediastinal nodes so I\u2019m interested to know your treatment plan. I have mets to mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes, right lung and pleura.

      "Content": "Thank you for sharing your feelings. Many times, I too have questioned if all the anxiety, pain and disappointments are worth it. But when I think of my husband and children and when I get good scan results, suddenly my thoughts change to \u201cyes I want to live.\u201d You wrote so beautifully and from the heart. I can somehow feel your pain and absolutely get you because I too am on Faslodex and Ibrance. I dread the monthly injections because I still have hematoma from a few months back yet when I get my scan results showing the Faslodex and Ibrance are still working, I am so happy and think that yes, the injections and pain are worth it.

I don\u2019t know what my next line of treatment will be after Ibrance fails. I hope it keeps me stable for a long time to come. Hope we do okay for a long time. take care and God bless! Maria",
