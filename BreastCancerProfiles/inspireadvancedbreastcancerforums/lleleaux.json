Wondering about what others experiences have been. dr said no hair loss but I\u2019ve read the opposite on the one post I read elsewhere. Told me same about Ibrance and that was not correct either. Not seeing many experiencing this drug but he is suggesting few SE and I don\u2019t trust that! Anyone who can share. Tks",

      "Content": "Well I go in for second treatment tomorrow. I have been coughing nonstop since treatment. Noticed things getting better last few days. While I do have some lung pleura issues, I started to realize that these side effects were so much like long ago when I ,in fact, had coughing from acid reflux and this felt identical so will talk to dr tomorrow. NO, I am not able to speak to dr same day as treatment (policies prohibit that) ugh but will try to talk to nurse. Also became dizzy when just starting infusion. Nurse guessed that was from Zophran. Passed pretty quickly. May have stayed a little unbalanced. Bits of nausea but didn\u2019t take meds, just had a bite to eat. Think my dosage is 2.3 mgs...don\u2019t know if that is the normal dosage. Sure hair will go. Sleepiness to a point that I could sleep all day long. Leave the house to stay awake. Novel over but trying to figure what is causing what so trying to compare. Hope the rest of our little group is doing well. My best.",

I am not necessarily expecting the best because of area pain and I\u2019m not able to take the suggested dosage of Ibrance with the Faslodex and Xgeva. My best to you and hoping for decent test results also.",

      "Content": "I do a lot of small things to help cope. Try to make the constant drs visit a little fun by having lunch or coffee with a friend after. I was taking Lexapro to sleep and started breaking pill in half. Once around 5 because of Faslodex side effects, then second half before bed. Figured it wouldn't hurt if I am taking same dosage and it helped a bit. I enjoy the smallest things....like decorating a small corner for Easter or putting a new wreath on the door. Will make Easter basket for 20yo daughter....anything small thing to look forward to. Even new earrings. Whatever will give a small lift. While I have little motivation at times, I find I can follow behind a friend most of the day if one is available. Don't know what that is but it helpsso you will find things as you can to pick up a little bit and while Im not crazy about taking even more meds, depression and anxiety medication is out there. Good luck. BTW I had to evict a renter who was destroying a small renthouse that I own and she suggested that God gave me cancer because of the way I treat people. Ugh. Picking myself up from that attack today. Hugs.",

I have MBC moved to bones and most recently affecting lung so drip is now where I am. They are telling me I will take it once a week for two and then third week, I\u2019m off. Unfortunately I cannot see dr on same day as chemo, as I did before because of insurance issues but would like to be able to meet with him first....comforting and last minute questions come up.

Just plain disappointed but just gonna wait it out. I always have to take such a low dose that I don\u2019t get results. Ugh.",

I always have to take such low doses that cancer can tolerate it very well, unfortunately. Was psyched getting off of ibrance, which counts just didnt ever tolerate. Hospitals terrify me too. Thank you for your shared experience i check back in with dr on weds. They gave me a shot yesterday but it wasnt Neulasta?! Good. luck.",
