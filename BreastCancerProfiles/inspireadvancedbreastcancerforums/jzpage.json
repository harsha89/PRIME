This novel finding is important given that elevated levels of T-cell activation have been associated with lower CD4+ T-cell gains following ART [4] and with mortality in this population [29]. Thus, our work suggests that cannabinoids may have an immunological benefit in the context of HIV infection ' They identified daily cannabis uses and stratified them into light, medium and heavy usage by their blood THC levels. They didn't find any differences in their overall CD4+ and CD8+ frequency's but as mentioned above did find a difference in activated T cell frequency with heavy use suppressing activation.

Although the data on immune suppression is clear, I think practical impact is not that significant as dosing probably doesn't reach high enough levels. (unless consumption is outrageous) That applies as well for it's cancer fighting properties. For instance, \"10 mg/kg body weight\" is ~75x typical humane dose. \"Cannabinoid-induced apoptosis in immune cells as a pathway to immunosuppression THC administration in vivo (10 mg/kg body weight) decreased the cellularity in the spleen and thymus,....\" \"150 mg/kg body weight\" is ~ 1000x typical humane dose \"CB2 cannabinoid receptor agonist, JWH-015, triggers apoptosis in immune cells: potential role for CB2-selective ligands as immunosuppressive agents....In vivo administration of JWH-015 (150 mg/kg body weight) inhibited the proliferation of splenocytes\") 10uM is about 300x typical human dose. \"investigated the effects of Aja on human peripheral blood T lymphocytes.
