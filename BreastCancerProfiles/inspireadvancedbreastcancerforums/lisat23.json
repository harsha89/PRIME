      "Content": "Hi, I did 2 months of zometa then switched to xgeva due to side effects of the zometa. I took xgeva for about a year and a half then had a small piece of exposed jaw bone. Oral surgeon said ONJ, onc said no more xgeva or any drug in it's class. Oral surgeon removed a large piece of upper jaw bone 4/23/19 (1.1 x 2.6 x3.3 mm). So far it is healing and did not affect my sinus thank god. I still have a hole in my gum a 5 weeks later that is healing . Oral surgeon says it will take time, and I will see him in mid June for a follow up. It seems that ONJ is alot more common than they say. Oral surgeon said that zometa stays in your body up to 11 years, while xgeva uas a half life of 3 months. Lisa",

      "Content": "Hi Cherylking, Luckily the only tooth this cost me was my back upper molar, my wisdom teeth were removed when I was 16. the piece of upper jaw bone removed was big (1.1 x 2.6 x3.3 mm) but it was where the back molar, wisdom, and behind that. We were worried the sinus might open into mouth and be a big problem, with food and drink able to go in. But after the DR came out of surgery he said he didn't even see the sinus!! Now he says the hole is a \"blind hole\" not opening anywhere else, and will take time to heal. I have to rinse every time I eat, and he gave me a syringe to squirt water gently, but it seems to be getting smaller. I am not sure if the bone will grow back, but as long as the gum fills in it will be fine. You can't tell by looking at me, it did not affect my cheek bone. If I press on my cheeks it feels a little more hollow?? He said that I would never be able to do an implant, but could wear a partial denture once it heals. The tooth extraction was covered by dental and the jaw debridement was covered by my medical insurance. Where do you live? I am on long island in New York, and my oral surgeon is one of the best for this (medicine related ONJ). He is dual certified as an Oral Surgeon and Medical Surgeon, and has written many papers on it. He even lectures on it. There were over 14 students/doctors there just to observe my surgery. If you google him, Dr Salvatore Ruggiero, you can read many of his articles. He used to be chief of oral and maxofacial surgery at the hospital, but is now private. It looks like he accepts all insurance though. Lisa",

      "Content": "Hi Cherylking, Did they say the sinus will defiantly be open? We were worried because it was a big possibility based on the x-ray. Dr said that he has found that the walls of the sinus have a tendency to get stronger/ tougher when there is a history of sinusitis that is related to this prior to surgery. So the wall might hold without the bone. Of course before the surgery we went over every possible outcome, best to worst. 1 The sinus is not involved. 2 The sinus is involved, but there is enough healthy tissue that he would be able to close it. 3 The sinus is involved and we would have to wait awhile until there was enough healthy tissue for him to go back and close it in a second surgery. 4 I would have to wear an \"accentuator\" (??) like a partial denture to cover the hole into the sinus. No matter the risk he said I needed the surgery. I think he was surprised at the size. He kept saying \"I removed a LARGE piece of bone.\" I goofed before it was ((1.1 x 2.6 x3.3 cm), about 1 inch by more than 1 inch by 1/2 inch Once the bone was removed, I was shocked by how much better it felt even that day! I think a piece of it was able to wiggle before and caused me the pain. Maybe you will be lucky(?) too? Prayers, Lisa",
