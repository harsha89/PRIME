      "Content": "I\u2019m on the doxil every 4 weeks and I find it much easier than AC-T. I had ACT when I found out I had BC in 2013 and I was hospitalized several times. I was told by doctors at Weil Cornell in NYC that it would be very difficult, but because I was just 60 I could take it. I felt like it almost killed me. It\u2019s a very difficult routine. I was very anxious about the Doxil since I had the other but I was \u2018 relatively\u2019 surprised. I took a PET scan Tues so I am just waiting to see the results after 3 months of infusion. Good luck whatever your mom tries",
