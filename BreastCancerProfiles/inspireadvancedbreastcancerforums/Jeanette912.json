      "Content": "I got the results of my latest scan today. I expected to hear that the breast cancer in my sternum was out of remission because I found a new lump on it (which is why we did the PET scan this morning). I wasn't expecting to hear that it has spread to my ribs and liver. I've been on Aromasin (exemestane) 25 mg for the past four years, which is when it first showed up again, only in my sternum. I also met my new oncologist today. The one whose care I've been under for the past 10 years (original diagnosis in 2008, double mastectomy and chemo) retired last month. This doctor is starting me on Faslodex and IBrance. I get my first injection next Monday. I pressed and was told that this treatment usually lasts two years before progression returns, if it works, and then there is chemotherapy. I know that in 2 years they probably will have created new medicines and treatments, but I am having trouble convincing myself. I'm allowing myself to wallow in self-pity tonight, then in the morning, I will start once again taking each day as it comes. I'm working from home for the Kentucky Unemployment Office, so I keep occupied during the day. As you know, nights are the hardest. I've been divorced for 12 years, live alone except for my 3 dogs, don't have many friends but the ones I have are close. Parents are both gone, and my sister is in Atlanta, though her phone calls always pull me out of the doldrums when I need her to. I'd like to hear from others who are on or have been on this combo treatment as to what side effects to expect. I know that fatigue is one of the side effects, but I already experience mild fatigue. Will the fatigue get worse? What are other side effects you've experienced? Will I be able to keep working? How long has the treatment lasted? I will appreciate any advice you can give me.",
