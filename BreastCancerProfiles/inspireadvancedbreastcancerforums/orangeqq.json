      "Content": "My cancer is very aggressive (triple negative).My dr and I tried 4th combinations of chemo, each combination helps me to stabilise the disease for 3 months before it came back on the same area (breast and lung nodules). These has been happening for almost 14 months. After deep consideration, the dr say masectomy might helps. So I had masectomy in Jan 2019. For the last few months my wound and rib area are alway red. Surgeon and oncologist said that it was nothing serious. Petscan report show mild increase uptake, but non specific and likely related to post surgery. Recently the redness has spread to lateral chest .I did a biopsy and it came back positive, the dr say it met to chestwall and saying high chances that the redness at my wound and rib contain cancer. Right now I am having taxol, Tecentriq, carboplatin (5th combinations). The dr saying that I might need to do radiation again which I had did once before. Edited May 9, 2019 at 12:18 pm",
