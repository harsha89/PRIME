      "Content": "Dear Waldbet: I can provide you with some reassuring evidence on this issue: An exposure\u2013response analysis was recently conducted using data from PALOMA-2 to assess the effect of changes in palbociclib (Ibrance) exposure (due to dose modification / reduction) on progression-free survival (PFS) in patients [Zheng 2017]. What they found was that the median PFS was similar in each dose level group, so duration of progression-free survival (PFS) was NOT associated with palbociclib exposure. These results suggest that patients who had different exposure levels to palbociclib due to dose reductions or interruptions still benefited comparably to those who didn't, and that the dose reduction algorithm implemented in PALOMA-2 (from 125 mg, down to 100 mg, down to 75 mg as needed) effectively managed palbociclib toxicity without significantly affecting it effectiveness or treatment outcome (see also: [McShane 2018]. These findings from the PALOMA-2 trial were then confirmed in PALOMA-3 where dose reduction (down to 75 mg) did not impact efficacy or survival outcome [Verma 2016]. The safety analysis from the PALOMA-3 trial showed no difference in PFS among patients who had dose reductions or delays, usually secondary to neutropenia. Finally, another retrospective study analyze the impact of dose delays and reductions on toxicity and progression free survival (PFS) in patients receiving palbociclib (Ibrance) [Clifton 2017]. CLINICAL LESSONS LEARNED: (1) Survival outcome (PFS) is NOT negatively affected in patients who required dose reductions and delays, whether early in their cycles, late in their cycles, or throughout the cycles. (2) Patients who are experiencing adverse side effects that are appreciably compromising their quality of life (QoL) SHOULD NOT HESITATE to request dose reductions or delays, since this will have no significant negative effect on their survival outcomes. (3) Patients who DO undergo dose reductions or delays tend to have significantly higher health-related QoL and experience significantly fewer adverse side effects. BOTTOM LINE: DOSE REDUCTIONS AND/OR DELAYS ON PALBOCICLIB (IBRANCE) DO NOT COMPROMISE CLINICAL SURVIVAL OUTCOMES. LOWER THRESHOLD: STRUGGLEBUSTED and JOSIEGIRL: Unlike reduce doses at 100 mg and at 75 mg which make no material difference to efficacy and survival outcome, we just don't have dose-outcome study data for reduction down to 50 mg. The official FDA dose guidance indicates \"If further dose reduction below 75 mg/day is required, discontinue\". This does NOT mean that dosing at the 50 mg level is without clinical benefit, ONLY that we LACK any supporting data to tell us one way or the other. However, I will report some of my own impressions and experiences. First, we have suspected that with the current three-week on and one week off schedule, a significant number of patients develop grade 3 or higher degree of neutropenia and require dose reduction and sometimes discontinuation, BUT more importantly with the one week break with the standard 3 weeks on and 1 week off dosing schedule, the fear - including my own - is that this could potentially lead to recovery of Rb phosphorylation (what's being suppressed by palbociclib (Ibrance) during the off week, which would allow for progression in the so-called \"vacation period\" on one week off. This is the motivation for colleagues at the Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM) conducting (under Cynthia Ma as principal investigator) a clinical trial (NCT03007979) testing a novel dosing schedule of a 5 days on and 2 days off (5-on/2-off continuous) schedule each week - every week with no weeks off drug. It turns out that if you do that the cumulative doses each 28-day cycle is just about the same with this (5-on/2-off continuous) schedule compared to conventional dosing, BUT now the bone marrow is not assaulted with the drug continuously for 21 uninterrupted days, now getting frequent breaks from therapy. What the investigators hypothesize is that the 5-on/2-off continuous schedule is more tolerable AND with less frequent high grade neutropenia and so with less need for dose interruption/reduction. A BONUS: this schedule also provides for a more continuous drug delivery since it abolished the week's break in therapy, so the speculation is that it could ultimately prove to be more efficacious AND more tolerable and avoid drug reductions and delays. AND although we don't yet know the final trial outcome - the trial began June 2017 - it is coming up to a FINAL completion date of February 2021, but it has a PRIMARY completion date of March 2019, so I am expecting some early results to be reported (formally or informally) in the next couple of month or so hopefully. But to me the novel schedule makes excellent \"molecular\" sense and similar dosing schemes with other agents that Larry Norton at MSK pioneered have always been successful, so the promise is good. SUGGESTION: Given that we have no data on the efficacy of a reduction down to 50 mg, one experimental option your oncologists might want to entertain is the WUSM trial's 5 days on and 2 days off (5-on/2-off continuous) schedule with the high likelihood of greater tolerability since the bone marrow takes a hit only for 5 - not 21 - days, before getting a vacation of 2 days to recover. Currently the trial protocol starts at 125 mg for 5 days a week, then 2 days off, repeating the cycle weekly, but a fallback position could still be 100 mg using the sane schedule. Me, I suspect that that reduction would not be necessary, but it's available under duress. REFERENCES [Clifton 2017] Clifton KK, Kimmel J, Yi M, Chad B, Litton J, Debu T, Meghan K.

      "Content": "Dear Waldbet, and Others: HOW TO THINK ABOUT AND DECIDE ON CDK INHIBITORS Except on one criterion I discuss below, the three approved CDK4/6 inhibitors - PALBOCICLIB (IBRANCE), RIBOCICLIB (KISQALI), and ABEMACICLIB (VERZENIO) - are fairly comparable on clinical benefits within first-line and second-line therapies in metastatic disease, so they separate mainly on adverse side effects, each with a somewhat different profile although all with manageable toxicity and relatively wide latitude for dose reductions and delays that do not compromise efficacy and outcome. But although as Waldbet has correctly pointed out they are in the same CLASS of agents - CDK4/6 inhibitors - they are NOT in the same SUBCLASS: uniquely, abemaciclib (Verzenio) is a CDK4-SELECTIVE CDK INHIBITOR [Hafner 2018]. This is important because myelotoxicity including neutropenia (low neutrophil counts) is primarily associated with CDK6, making the incidence of neutropenia on abemaciclib (Verzenio) dramatically lower and more manageable (although it stills occurs, but less aggressively and tends to be transient in early cycles). CDK-4 selective inhibitors are more associated with GI side effects (like diarrhea) and significantly less associated with any serious hematological toxicities like neutropenia. And NOTE: it is typically harder to manage hematological toxicities like neutropenia, than to manage GI side effects like diarrhea (for which I have elsewhere in these Inspire forums described and designed a preemptive (to radically reduce chance of ever developing problematic diarrhea) Modified ExteNET Trial Regimen that is highly effective even in the most intractable and recurrent/refractory cases.). But for later-line treatment, starting at third-line out to eleventh and above (number of previous lines of therapy), some of the best survival outcomes to data of any agent (even compared to non-endocrine targeted andÂ  chemotherapeutic approaches) is associated uniquely with abemaciclib (Verzenio). Here\u2019s my take on this extraordinary agent, and why: 1. HIGH CLINICAL BENEFIT AND DURABILITY OF RESPONSES: MONARCH 1 (monotherapy) MONARCH-2 (with letrozole) and MONARCH-3 (with fulvestrant) clinical trials have decisively confirmed has high clinical benefit rates and durable responses of abemaciclib (Verzenio) in later line settings. 2. EFFECTIVE AS MONOTHERAPY: Abemaciclib (Verzenio) - unlike the other CDK4/6 inhibitors - has strong single-agent activity in HR\u2013positive MBC, 3. LOW TOXICITY: Abemaciclib (Verzenio) has good tolerability profile with significantly reduced neutropenia, and manageable GI adverse events. 4. Rb-INDEPENDENCE: Abemaciclib (Verzenio) is active even in retinoblastoma protein (Rb)-deficient cells in which CDK4/6 inhibition by palbociclib or ribociclib is completely ineffective. 5. BEST OVERALL SURVIVAL IN LATER-LINE SETTINGS: AND to date has returned the highest overall survival (OS) in challenging heavily pretreated settings of any oncotherapeutic agent, whether endocrine therapy, chemotherapy, or biological therapy, in MBC patients who experienced progression with previous treatments, benefiting survival in a population of patients 90% of whom had visceral metastases (liver and/or lung) and over half had three or more sites of metastasis). 6. STRONG BENEFIT IN LIVER METASTASES: Finally, abemaciclib (Verzenio) appears to have unique benefits in liver metastases, as I have demonstrated elsewhere: an exploratory subgroup analysis was conducted in patients with liver metastases at baseline across all three of the MONARCH (1, 2, and 3) trials, demonstrating it's particular efficacy in inducing tumor response / regression as well as delaying disease progression in this population [Di Leo 2018]. And another exploratory analysis [Goetz 2018] of the MONARCH 2 and MONARCH 3 TRIAL RESULTS found that while all subpopulations benefited from the addition of abemaciclib to endocrine therapy regardless of prognosis, substantial benefit of abemaciclib was observed in the liver metastases subgroup (among others), characterized by large increases in progression-free survival / PFS (hazard ratios = 0.4 to 0.5) and in objective response rates / ORR (over 30%). But there is one last advantage that has been completely overlooked in the literature: 7. ADVANTAGE OF CONTINUOUS ADMINISTRATION IN AGGRESSIVE DISEASE: Abemaciclib (Verzenio) has a superior dosing regimen / schedule: Palbociclib and ribociclib inhibit both CDK4 and 6 but trigger significant neutropenia due to the fact they inhibit CDK6, causing some marrow suppression and neutropenia, and for that reason you treat for 21 days, but give a week off to allow for recovery of the bone marrow. Abemaciclib (Verzenio) is vastly more potent in inhibiting CDK4 CDK6, so neutropenia and bone marrow suppression in general is reduced, which means it can be given continuously / daily, with no need for a vacation, time off for bone marrow recovery. CLINICAL LESSON: What this last feature of continuous administration means is that abemaciclib (Verzenio) shows best benefit and moves ahead of the other CDK inhibitors (those being given 3 weeks on, 1 week off) is for the most highly aggressive cancers, which are those with short treatment-free intervals, heavy metastases, Grade 3 (highly proliferative, often also with loss of the progesterone receptor (PR), and with liver metastasis, the most difficult to treat within ER\u2013positive disease. In these most challenging and aggressive metastatic breast cancer, abemaciclib (Verzenio) shines brightest and pulls well ahead of the others, since we can just keep the inhibition of the targets going continuously without any break to allow the tumor cells to recover, the secret of densely packed metronomic therapies - \"Give No Quarter!\" to the tumor cells, they are ALWAYS being bombarded, always being suppressed. TECHNICALLY: This continuous \"barrage\" strategy of abemaciclib (Verzenio) reduces the chance of what is called \"REBOUND G1/S ACTIVATION\" - the return of aggressive cell division and proliferation - that potentially occurs during the REST period of time that the patient is off the drug (week-off period), which if this is allowed to rebound, could undue an appreciable portion of the benefits of the previous three on-cycle weeks.
