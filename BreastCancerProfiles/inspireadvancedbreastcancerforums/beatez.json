      "Content": "\"I have two kids and a grandson that means the world to me, I will Never Give up and will fight this terrible disease\", you wrote. Part of this struggle is how to get yourself out of the obsessive fear. There are techniques such as counseling, meditation or yoga and all of them can be really good. But I want to share with you somethig simple that helped me again and again: daily walks in a pleasant environment. It really makes me feel so much better adwith my feet on the ground. But from time to time this isn't enough.I have then to \"look the beast in the eye\". I tell myself: Okay, I will die. What would I want to say before to the ones I love. What would I want to do still if my death was near. In my mind I then prepare for it. This has on me a calming effect. When I am \"prepared\" I can turn again in the other direction, fighting the disease by healthy living, being involved in tasks (preferably being active with something meaningfull), AND... spoiling myself and enjoying good moments to the full. With your latest diagnosis you are right now still in shock. But when your new treatment will be in place I am sure you will find out what works with you. Prayers, mantras, a boxing ball or whatever... ;)",

Addition to your list: As somebody who did speak about my MBC diagnosis, it happened that years later I encounteted someone who apparently was shocked to see me. \"You said you had cancer!\" She just didn't add explicitly \"You should be dead by now\". Another thing making me a pretender in the eyes of some: I am telling that I am now undergoing chemo treatment. But with Xeloda I still have my hair... Still, I'm not willing to tell less than the truth when asked how and what. Avoiding to say it as it is may be more polite but would leave me more sombre.",

      "Content": "Mbcbone, I agree with you. That professor of Radiology spoke about statistical probability. But what I learned from statistics is that there is always also room for exceptions. Since mets to my lung arra were found in 2006 I live on the hope to be an exception. My intuition told me to gamble that my cancer is not one of the most aggressive and I have in those 13 years been insisting on first trying mild therapies and/or low doses. Avoiding overmedication is one way to live longer. I have not been NED ever after the mbc diagnosis. But I am under the impression that stability is what counts the most. If that can be had with NED - fine. But it is okay with me to have in my body \"sleeping\" tumors, as long as I can function. Why sacrificing the healthy part of me to get totally rid of those sleeping mets? Preserving the healthy part of body and mind is also important for survival.Therefore, I believe in staying active but avoiding stress, doing enough enjoyable things; and also: daily walks, eating wisely, adding supplements. You cannot leave it only to the doctors.",

But patallel to that you need to work on getting rid of the stress. Stress is unpleasant and not healthy either. It could easily make other symptoms worse. Maybe you should seek advice for that and find what suits you. There is of course acupuncture and yoga etc. But you could also see a councillor. All this NOT instead of seeking physical checks, but in addition. Your kids should have a mother who is not stressed all the time. And more important you yourself have the right to be supported in order to deal with the facts of life without complicating them by unhelpful stressing. And ... don't forget to spoil yourself from time to time. An evening with a friend can cheer you up. Also, a walk in a beautiful park. Or buying that book or that dress which is a bit expensive.
