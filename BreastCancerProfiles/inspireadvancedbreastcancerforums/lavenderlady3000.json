      "Content": "Hi everyone I\u2019ve just joined this site after a recommendation and would really love to hear from anyone as sometimes I feel so isolated with this illness. I have stage 4 breast cancer and I take exemestane palbocyclib and zoladex. I am really suffering with depression at the moment and I am desperate to try to see the positives I still have in my life - mainly my wonderful family. I just can\u2019t motivate myself to do anything even though I\u2019m still physically able to. I even struggle to meet up with friends or anything like that. I\u2019m also finding it difficult to find which bits of the site are most relevant to my situation. Obviously I\u2019ll return any friendship offered! Any suggestions warmly received, Jx",
