    "Content": "Hi Suzie, I\u2019ve been taking IBRANCE and extremestane for almost 2 years. I\u2019ve been on short delays in taking my IBRANCE due to low blood counts and it did not effect treatment. I know everyone is different in how they respond. Your doctor is looking out for you lowering the dose may be better then stopping for a short time. You are in my thoughts and prayers. Sue",
