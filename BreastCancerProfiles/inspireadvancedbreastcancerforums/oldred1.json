    "Content": "I have 3 liver tumors (TNBC) that are growing and bone mets that are Ductal ER+ (stable). Also, BRCA2 positive. I am 4 years out from MBC dx. Xeloda, Carboplatin, Gemzar, Lynparza, and Navelbine have stopped working on liver. Oncologist is looking at Abraxane+Tecentriq or Eribulin+Keytruda. Waiting for PD-L1 results. Has anyone had either of these combinations? The immuno therapies could be cost prohibitive. It sure is a challenge and I don't want to be disabled from the treatments. Donna",
