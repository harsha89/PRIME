    "Content": "Hello Bestbird, just a question, not relating to this post as such. I started off last year with \u2018straight forward\u2019 oestrogen Pos her 2 meg grade 4 metastatic breast cancer, with reasonable treatment options. This year Feb a cat scan showed it had changed to lymphangetic carcinomatosis affecting lungs, oematum and small 4mm rear tight sided brain met. The stats are not good with this and my onc thinks I am too unwell to change from Taxol to erubilin. Do you have any current info re this diagnosis please? The only thing I find is bad news online. If this is the case then so be it. I know that you keep bang up to date with anything cancer related. Many thanks, SueG",
