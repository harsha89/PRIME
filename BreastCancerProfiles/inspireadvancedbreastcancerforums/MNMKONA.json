      "Content": "The reviewing editor of that article, Jeffrey Settleman, is with Calico Life Sciences. The Google backed life science org. http://fortune.com/2017/03/24/google-calico-c4-therapeutics/ And within that article Fighterm posted they state \"ERX-11 is orally bioavailable......\". Which likely means they have, or are developing, the blueprints for \"the pill\" to begin the trial process. Maybe within that CT4 partnership framework mentioned in the Calico news piece.",

      "Content": "A likely efficacious single agent application for CD47 anti bodies in OVCA might be post optimal debulking. The tumor burden is very low, it's micro environment has been severely disrupted, and macrophages are naturally drawn to wound sites as part of the body's wound healing process. But agree with Fight that single agents often are not enough in any setting. Trillium did announce a trial arm combo with PD-1 (can't remember what disease setting, wasn't OVCA). Some OVCA does not express elevated CD47 too, so that's a consideration.",
