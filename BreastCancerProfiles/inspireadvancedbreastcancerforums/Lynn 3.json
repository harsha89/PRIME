      "Content": "Anne, As always, thanks for your willingness to research and share such valuable information. You are so well versed on this wicked disease! I have been on the Keytruda/Lynparza combo for almost 9 months with a lot of stability but am afraid the cancer is getting around the treatment. (hard to differentiate between arthritis, tumor pain, or pain from these drugs!). Had a Guardant 360 test last year and even though I\u2019m ERPR+HER2- as well as BRAC-, this was recommended by my ONC. After reading your post about this newly approved drug, I went back to the results of the Guardant test and found that my tumors show PIK3CA H1047R 32% and PIK3CA E453Q 29% Is this what you are referring to as far as the mutation? So hard to understand! Any enlightening is appreciated as well as your continued support to this forum. Hugs from Alabama, Lynn",
