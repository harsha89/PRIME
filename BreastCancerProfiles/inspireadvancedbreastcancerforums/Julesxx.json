It\u2019s a terrible shock when something like this happens but please know that you do have a future and that one day, when you least expect it, you will find happiness and balance again. Hang on in there. Julesxx",

      "Content": "Hi Jay I saw Dr Crook recently and he thinks that DS 8201 is likely to have an effect in the brain. I believe his trial is actually set up in London now as well as Guildford. He said he has 5 patients on it who where literally dying and are now actually recovered enough to lead relatively normal lives ( normal for us MBC gang is actually not anybody else\u2019s normal, but still good). Every good wish to you both. Jxx",

      "Content": "I got my MRI and PET scan results back today. The PET was completely clear - no activity. The MRI showed a small area of activity around the trigeminal nerve but everything else clear. The oncologist said it may be activity from the surgery. I\u2019m not sure about that as my markers are staying slightly up. The 125 is 40 (normal 35 and below)and the 15-3 is 20 (normal below 25). So it may be that there is a bit left. If there is I will need radiotherapy to the operation site. I have already booked myself an appointment with a neurologist who does gamma knife. It would be lovely to leave it but that\u2019s not the way to survive. But tonight I am happy. And I am going to have a little drink! I get to live another day and the World has opened up again. Thank you my inspire sisters. I don\u2019t know how I would have got through the last two weeks of waiting without you. My very best wishes to all those awaiting results. Yesterday was dark but today I get to glimpse the dawn. Julesxx",

I know many of you have your own worries and this makes your words so much more precious. We all help to carry one another. Sometimes the World seems to have gone mad but you all show the other good side, the side of light. Many thanks, Jxx",
