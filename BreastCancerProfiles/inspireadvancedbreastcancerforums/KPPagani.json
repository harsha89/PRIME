      "Content": "Rather than 21 on and 7 off, I take 5 on and 2 off. 100 mg down from the original 125. I have had only one delay in 15 months on this regimen. The onc is aware, but did not prescribe (standard of care issues). I also read that Ibrance interferes with the maturing of the white blood cells rather than destroying them. Can't remember where this info came from. I am 73 and think age might also be a factor. Those WBC aren't as robust as they once were. Good luck.",
