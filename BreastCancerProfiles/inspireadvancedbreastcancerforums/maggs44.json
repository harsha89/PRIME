    "Content": "Hi everyone. I\u2019m stage IV HER2+ PR & ER+ I was originally diagnosed Stage III in 2006 w/spread to stomach muscle lymph node and lung in 2016. I was on Herceptin and Perjeta and Femera but recently the only spot left in my lung grew just a little. My Onc wanted me to do SBRT radiation on it and continue my treatment they way it is,BUT my insurance apparently knows better. I am no longer certified for the treatment I\u2019m on and the SBRT they consider experimental so they deem my treatment is now \u201cno longer medically necessary \u201c. I go to my Onc today to see what\u2019s going to happen now. They said they would appeal, but what do I do in the meantime? I\u2019m freaking out now. What treatments are next..? How does the insurance co know more than my doctor? Any advice would be greatly appreciated Thanks",
