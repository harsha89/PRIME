    "Content": "Am new to this site and delighted to see in this thread postings from the UK. Our friends in the US seem to have access to more drugs than we have in the NHS here. I was diagnosed with mets last November when I lifted a heavy case and fractured a collar bone! Primary tumour in 2011 with lymph node clearance but they didnt remove all the cancerous nodes so the mets started there in the axilla and spread to bones. I had no idea and was initially falling apart with fear and anxiety. Then someone suggested a therapist and I have found talking to her really useful. Not cheap but for me well worth spending my savings! I still have times feeling anxious and fearful but have built up a new routine which incorporates the monthly infusion and blood tests and oncology visits with treats for myself on those weeks. I feel fortunate that this has hit at the ripe age of 77 rather than in mid life but nevertheless I have kids and grandkids and an 83 year old husband and was in excellent health so had anticipsted being around and being involved for many more years. Perhaps that will happen thanks to the Afinitor and Aramosin and monthly infusions of Zometa. I live in London where I thought there would be lots of support groups but have found only one at the Haven in Fulham. Any Londoners out there? Best wishes and good luck to all of you x",
