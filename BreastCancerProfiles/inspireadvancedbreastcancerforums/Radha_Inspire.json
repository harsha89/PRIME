      "Content": "Greetings! I\u2019d like to introduce a new resource for all of us in the Inspire community - a glossary. We believe this will be a helpful resource that will improve your experience on Inspire. Thanks to the many, many of you who suggested this feature and helped make it a priority. Inspire\u2019s glossary includes common terms and acronyms that reflect the shorthand that patients, caregivers, and others who seek support here use to talk about their conditions and experiences. For example, you would find 6MWT (6-minute walking test) but we also included LWASA (let\u2019s wait and see approach). In creating the glossary, we began with a list of terms compiled by Inspire\u2019s community team from around the site and solicited further suggestions from a few large communities in order to have a baseline group of terms. You can access the glossary via the drop down menu next to your Inspire username at the top left of the page. Here is the direct link: https://www.inspire.com/about/glossary This glossary is very much a work in progress and we would love your help in growing it. So, please visit the page, use the resource, and if you don\u2019t see the term you are looking for or you would like to suggest one, leave it as a comment in response to this post or email glossary@inspire.com. Remember to include the following details: - Term, abbreviation, or acronym - If an abbreviation or acronym, a fully spelled out version - If applicable, a definition Thank you!
