    "Content": "Thank you, lleleaux, for starting this post. I start on Halaven on Tuesday for my liver mets. My oncologist took me off a clinical trial for Tesetaxel with Xeloda which I was on for 8 months. My bone mets stabilized and/or shrank. It worked for a while on my liver mets, but now they are back and increasing in size, along with my tumor markers rising. So, I'll be glad to start Halaven next week!",
