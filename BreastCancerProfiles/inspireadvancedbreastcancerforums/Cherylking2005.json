      "Content": "You would be surprised by how many women are Stage IV MBC. There are a lot of us. I personally hate the Ibrance commercials ... not that they advertise it but that they make it seem like with this drug and Letrozole your life goes back to normal. If you consider exhaustion, constipation, diarrhea and shortness of breath normal, then it would be normal. I\u2019m not even going to mention the pain or other lovely side effects of which there are many. I\u2019m. It saying that I am not grateful for ibrance as it has given me two additional years but it is not a walk in the park. Hell I would be happy if I could walk a whole block without excruciating pain or shortness of breath.",

      "Content": "Lisat23 please keep us (or me) posted as to your path in dealing with your ONJ. I gave been in the throes of this path for a year now. Last visit a couple weeks ago they predicted another six months st must before I lose three upper right jawbone teeth and bone, with a possibility of two more teeth. What happens if jawbone does not grow back string enough to support a partial? What happens if they need to make a jawbone our if titanium? How long will I facially bd deformed? Will Medicare insurance pay for the titanium jawbone? These are just a few of the fears run through my mind and that I live with 24/7. My only saving grace is that I am allergic to penicillin so my backup plan is to get one or two pills as I have no intention of living my life with that kind if deformity. That is no quality of life.",

      "Content": "Lisat23 Thanks for the additional information. I will have a good sized hole going into my sinus that they will need to figure out how to plug it if will affect my speech. I\u2019m seeing Dr Tara Aghaloo who is an ONJ specialist here in Los Angeles at UCLA. She too also teaches and has written papers on ONJ. I believe I just read an article that had both of our doctors referenced in the footnotes. I\u2019m glad you only lost one tooth. I think I wouldn\u2019t be freaking out so much if it were just 3 teeth but now it is all of my right upper back teeth, excluding my wisdom tooth that was removed decades ago.",

      "Content": "I ended up with ONJ from Xgeva and would never agree to take anything in this family of drugs that has the potential for ONJ. My oncologist switched me to faslodex shots once a month after the initial loading doses. I have been on faslodex for a year now along with ibrance and letrozole. So far so good but will know more after I get scan results later this week. Last scan results my bond cancer was under control but had some progression with lung cancer.",
