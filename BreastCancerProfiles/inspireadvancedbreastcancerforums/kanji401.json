      "Content": "Thanks for your inspirational post. I'm new to MBC but my mets are quite extensive in my bones and many in my lungs. At first I wondered, \"What's the sense in going through all the difficult treatments only to extend my life for a little while?\" But I learned very quickly that living matters a lot to those whose lives I touch and now I'm ready to fight to live as long as I can for them. I'm also ready to fight for myself because I love life and living is all I know.",

      "Content": "Angelical, I know exactly how you feel. I'm going through the same thing right now. I was diagnosed with BC 2a 14 years ago. A month ago, because of rib pain, I found out that I have mets in my bones: legs, pelvis, ribs, arm, sternum, maybe spine, and skull. The cancer has fractured my sternum and a rib that I know of. I also have at least 10 spots in my lung pleura in both lungs. I feel shocked and devastated! I've had x-rays, CT scans, brain MRI, PET scan, bone scan, and yesterday a sternum biopsy because they felt a lung biopsy was too risky. Now I'm waiting for the biopsy results and to see the oncologist again to hear what he has to say about a treatment plan. I'm on Medicare so some of the drugs will be terribly expensive. I feel like I'm not going to live very much longer and I have so much to do to wrap up my life and dispose of all non-essential items so my kids won't be burdened with those tasks after I'm gone. I'm also afraid that I'll lose my ability to walk so I won't be able to take care of my dog or myself. I live alone and feel SO overwhelmed! The pain in my fractured rib is slowly getting worse which makes it painful to wear a bra and I'm getting pain in my leg which makes it harder to walk longer distances. I'm scared to death because medical professionals always talk about how painful bone cancer is. This whole thing is my worst nightmare. I know we just have to take it one day at a time. We have to be grateful for what we have and for our ability to function TODAY. That means that today is a good day. I try not to focus on the future right now because it would drive me crazy. Just want to let you know that you're not alone in beginning this new journey into the unknown.",
