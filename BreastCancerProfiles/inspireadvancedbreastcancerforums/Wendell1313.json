    "Content": "Hi Ted, Just wanted to say that I appreciated your response. An excellent analysis of so-called \"expertise\" on both sides--from patients whose opinions qualify as scientific knowledge to physicians whose education and practice frequently fall far short of either evidence based care, or even a trustworthy understanding of the research in their own fields of practice. I agree with everything you said and as someone who has lost a loved one as the result of a disastrous treatment protocol previously believed to be \"safe,\" I remain more than skeptical of any \"expert\" opinion that is not backed up by rigorous, precise, honest examination, study and presentation of facts--for and against. Legitimate opinions are welcome, subjective experiences are often helpful to read---but to call a personal essay advice from an \"expert\" is misleading and, as you note, dangerous. Just another watered down use of the language in a marketing ploy disguised as \"help.\" Lisa",
