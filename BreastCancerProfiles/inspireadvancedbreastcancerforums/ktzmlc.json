      "Content": "Cherylking2005, My oncologist told me that the pain (muscle and joint, like I've been hit by a truck) is most likely from the AI. (mine is Exemestane, yours, probably Letrozole) So I read online somewhere that taking Vitamin D with it, is supposed to help. (I take 5000, every other day. Maybe it's mind over matter, but I think it's helping. Moving and stretching help too! I've been on Ibrance for 3 1/2 years. (75mg) Try the vitamin D and see if it helps. Good luck. Katie",

      "Content": "JudyinFlorida52, I hope I do too. I asked him what my next corse would be, if/when the Ibrance stops working and he said Afinitor and Exemestane, (already on Exemestane). My biggest complaint is that my leg and foot cramps have gotten worse. Does anyone else get these? I'll have to do some Googling and see what's out there about it. I'm afraid to drive on the highway, because they are so debilitating! BTW...I told my oncologist that I wasn't taking the Ibrance everyday, because of the side effects. I miss two, sometime 3 pills a week and my tumor markers are still good. I think they (Pharma) are over dosing us, like they did when the birth control 1st came out. That's probably why they are doing that Ibrance trial of being on 4 days and off 3 every week, instead of on 21 days, off 7 days. I tried that, but the side effects were worse for me. Keep me posted on the Afinitor and it's side effects, ok? Hopefully, I won't be needing it for a while. Good luck to you! Katie",
