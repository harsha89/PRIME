      "Content": "My wife is 55yo and is ~4mo s/p large mastectomy with node dissection for TNBC. About 7 weeks postop she developed cutaneous mets along and above the surgical scar. She has been applying 5-fluorouracil for (5% Effudex) since then -- about 8 weeks - but they have continued to progress. I found some previous discussions that mentioned a 100 page MBC guide prepared by \"BestBird\", but these threads are now well over 3 years old. Can anyone share any information on electrochemotherapy? A local dermatologist used liquid nitrogen (Cryotherapy) on 5 of the lesions a few days ago so we will see what effect that may have. Also since she has had slow progression of lesions on the Effudex, we are thinking of asking for a switch to Imiquimod cream. Can anyone comment on any experience with Imiquimod or electrochemotherapy? thank you in advance -",
