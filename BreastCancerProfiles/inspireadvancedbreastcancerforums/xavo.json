      "Content": "teamcc, your questioning of Fightem's intention of posting her understanding of cancer and cancer treatments crossboardly sounds very odd. Fightem's posts might not be for you, but for those who would like to understand better their disease and the broader picture of the clinical world that treats the disease, Fightem's posts have been very educational and informational. She is surely very appreciated by many for it.",

      "Content": "chipofbags, my understanding of fighterm's approach to treating cancer is studies, studies, and studies. She wants more fellow patients to be armed with deeper and broader knowledge of the disease when it's time to make treatment decisions. Anecdotes of cancer cases could be very misleading and more often useless. I believe the better informed patients always make better treatment decisions. What's wrong to learn? One can still go a different way of treatment after knowing the studied ways. It's always better than going a different way without knowing the studied treatments. I appreciate hugely that fighterm sends her posts crossboardly, for otherwise I would not be able to find her posts due to she and I have different diseases.",
