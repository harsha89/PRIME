      "Content": "Hi, Lavenderlady, I find my Ibrance puts me in a rather dark mood. But what works for me is the following: (1) Gallows humor (2) Keeping very busy indeed--I go to the gym, I go to tap dance classes, and I work. When I was really sick, however, in the middle of chemo, I couldn't do these things. But if you're not having infusions and can manage to keep busy, it might help--I say this because working and doing other things distracts me and sports really make me feel better. I just wrote an essay on cancer treatment in Germany--and on dealing with cancer in general, using humor: http://volneyroadreview.com/2019/03/01/issue-1-2-essay-melissa-k... Also use humor on my blog: http://www.thecriticalmom.blogspot.com Hope this helps. For me anyway, laughter is the best medicine. I am stage four estrogen-positive breast cancer, using Ibrance, Faslodex, Xgeva",

      "Content": "For me, the following helps with depression (and oh-my-God-the-mets could-come-back-any-nanosecond anxiety) (1) Activity. I always liked ballet and tap. Can't do ballet after an operation on my femur (mets) but working toward returning to ballet: exercises at the gym and tap. (2) I eat whatever the heck I want unless I go over a certain number of kilos. Doughnuts for breakfast? Yum. Second glass of wine? You bet. But I do buy wine with lower alcohol content (3) I write.",

      "Content": "Gracejmz: Xgeva is usually given every month. Lesions can show up unexpectedly. If you are not at a major medical center, find one, or Google \"ten best\" breast cancer treatment centers. You may want a second opinion. Just be sure you are in a place where your doctors are very, very familiar with your kind of cancer and you trust them .",

      "Content": "They advertise because they're allowed to advertise--in the USA and in Australia drug companies can advertise to general audiences, as opposed to specialized medical ones. I don't like this but a friend who works for Big Pharma, and whom I trust, says they don't actually make that much money with the ads--not enough to offset what is lost in governmentally-sanctioned lower prices in European and other countries. But in the States, drug prices remain relatively unregulated (as far as I can tell) so are skyrocketing. At any rate, I've written about those commercials here: https://thecriticalmom.blogspot.com/2018/11/american-optimism-an...",
