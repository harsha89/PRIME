    "Content": "I was diagnosed Stage 4 de novo in January 2013. I am currently NED and have been so since September 2013. My oncologist is super supportive and excited for me. He has never once said anything I construed as negative. I eat well, excercise, and compliment traditional medicine with some naturopathic medicine. I think the key is a positive attitude. I plan to be around for a long, long time! Keep the faith.",
