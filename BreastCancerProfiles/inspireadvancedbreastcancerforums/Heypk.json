    "Content": "I hate those ads. It makes it sound like some \"miracle\" drug and having MBC is a a walk in the park if your on it. New normal? This ad just makes me cringe everytime I see it. I actually said \"go to hell\" one time when the ad came on. Yeah i was having a bad day. lol Ibrance didn't work for me. And now I've seen the Verzenio ads.....ugh. I am a respiratory therapist and occasionally would have patients ask about some medication they saw on tv. Like Jean1948condo's son says.... not every medication is right for every patient....what works for me doesn't mean it works for you. As we all know :-) Prayers for everyone. :-)",
