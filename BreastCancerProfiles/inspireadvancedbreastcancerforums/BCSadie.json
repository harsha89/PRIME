    "Content": "Also diagnosed stage IV due to right pleural effusion in December 2016, almost 16 years after my original stage IIa diagnosis. I had a lot of fluid which promptly returned after a thoracentesis so they inserted a PleurX Catheter. I had it for about six months until it suddenly dried up. The bottom third of my right lung no longer functions and I still have pockets of loculated fluid with lots of adhesions but generally am doing well. Taxol failed as did Letrozole but Faslodex seems to be keeping things under control. I am experiencing more achiness and fatigue lately which may be from the Faslodex. I think by pleural consolidation they mean thickening of the pleural membrane. I find it interesting that they measured this on you. I always get the impression from the reports that they are primarily looking for masses. In my case I have suspicions that the pleural mets are continuing to spread slowly - I have some chest discomfort on the right side, feel it is harder to take a breath and also have some caving of my lower ribs likely due to the pleural mets pulling on the ribs. I see my MO at the end of next month and will be chatting with him about this.",
