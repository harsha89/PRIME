      "Content": "4000mg/day of Xeloda is a high dose. You might want to talk to your oncologist about lowering the dose. I took 2000mg/day (1 week on, 1 week off) for a year and they have now lowered my dose to 1500 (1000mg AM, 500mg PM). The lower doses really helped with my side effects. A study published in the Annals of Oncology in 2005 showed that the lower doses were actually just as effective.",

      "Content": "I have been on Xeloda for more than a year. I have hand and foot side effects. The hand effects were the most troublesome. I used a lot of uric acid cream and other creams. I had such a great response with Xeloda that after 11 months, my oncologist reduced my dose from 1000mg twice a day to 1000mg in the morning and 500mg in the evening. One week on, one week off. This greatly helped my hands. So far Xeloda is still working even at the reduced dose. By the way, at my clinic (a major cancer clinic in Seattle), 2000mg a day of Xeloda is considered the standard dose. Some clinics in the US give much more but it may not be necessary.",
