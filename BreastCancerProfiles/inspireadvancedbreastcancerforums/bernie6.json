      "Content": "My experience is similar. I had been on xGiva, and has developed jaw necrosis. It sounds like it was worse than yours. I had 2 debridments, and then some additional bits of bone. I had been off the xGiva for a year and a half. My previous oncologist said that I should go back onto the xGiva. I had radiation on my spine-hip area due to pain. He said we might have to \"rob Peter to pay Paul\" -- I read that to balance the bone strength and the jaw issue. I saw my dentist, had the cleaning before the treatment, and then moved to another state. My new (current) oncologist said that I should go back on the xGiva, but every 12 weeks instead of every 4 weeks. In some sense, I see that as two opinions. I had my second shot this week. While I felt that I had good dental care in my previous state, I spent the same care selecting my new dentist that I did selecting my new oncologist. I do believe that I have upped the quality of the dental care. All of my x-rays will now be external so that nothing will push into my jaw, and the hygienist gave my additional information of dental care. I am now on a four month cleaning/recall schedule at the dentist. This is a dentist who has worked with similar patients in the past. This is a dentist who was highly recommended by another dentist. My previous oncologist also wanted me walking quite a bit. I think that this was \"weight bearing\" exercise to strengthen the bones. While I exercise and do yoga, this was an addition. I also take (was told to take) a daily calcium chew and 2000 units of vitamin D, since diagnosis. I have always assumed that this is for the bones. Except for what I was told to take, I don't take any other supplements. My diagnosis is similar to yours, multiple bones especially the spine, pelvis and hips, Ibrance, letrozole, with diagnosis about 2.5 years ago. Best wishes on your decisions.",

      "Content": "The combination is also for bone mets. I started with extensive (numerous) bone mets about 2.5 years ago. The mets are in all three parts of my spine, my pelvis, my hips, and a long bone in my leg and arm, plus a few other places. I have had scans that are stable (stable is good) and some that showed reduction. I was getting both bone scans and CT scans for the first two years. Now I am only getting CT scans. I have moved to another state, and therefore have a different, very well respected oncologist. I have learned to accept \"no progression\" for my last two scans as a really good thing, and enjoying my life. While I am not a medical person of any kind, I would assume that if the mets in the organs are reduced or gone, the medication is working. The combination is recommended also for bone mets only. Wishing you the best.",

      "Content": "The calcium chew that I am taking has 650 mg of calcium plus some vitamin D and vitamin K. I can take it more easily than the calcium tablets -- I have a strong gag reflex. I did have full body bone scans with my first oncologist for two years. I think it was to look for the extent of the bone mets -- they were extensive. My current oncologist only does CT scans of the body. I did get a dexa scan this spring. My primary care physician sent me for the dexa scan. While there were differences in the three numbers, it indicated that I did not have osteoporosis or osteopenia. I was happily surprised. The dexascan looks at bone strength -- it does not look for cancer. I have had two broken ankles during this time, but as far as I know, this is a balance issue. Once you have a fall, you tend to be more careful, and push youself less on balance, and your balance drops. The fear (on balance) is the factor and not the cancer mets in the bones.",
