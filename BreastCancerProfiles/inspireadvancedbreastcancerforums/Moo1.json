      "Content": "Some of us stage 4 metastatic BC have been on various protocols until they stop working! I \u2018ve tried them all, but have been on IBrance/ Faslodex since February 2016 with good results. I\u2019m due for scans in early June so I \u201cpray hard\u201d that I It is still working. I do have fatigue, some joint and muscle pain, but feel it\u2019s a small price to pay if It keeps me stable! Like all of you, I worry when the \u201c other shoe will drop\u201d and fear each 6 month scan result. Hopefully, those of us on the IBrance/Faslodex train can keep riding! I pray for us all! Moo1",

Tried allergy tabs and Flonase nasal spray. Finally, Pulmonologist prescribed Proventil to control the cough! It\u2019s just an annoying side effect of the treatment unless your scan shows more than inflammation. Wishing you well! Moo1",
