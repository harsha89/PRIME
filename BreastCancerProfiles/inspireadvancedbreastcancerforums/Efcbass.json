      "Content": "Hang in there! I was diagnosed June 2017 MBC with bone mets. Initial success with letro and Ribo, progressed after 9 months. Liquid biopsy revealed ESR1 mutation, switched to Faslodex/ribo. Progressed three months later, sent tumor to Tempus and discovered ATM Gene and CHEK2 mutation. I am currently on Xeloda and just completed radiation to my primary tumors. Feeling good, work full time and have two young children. Scans next month. Advocate for yourself and make the case for a liquid biopsy and tumor analysis. You want to understand your specific cancer and take advantage of precision medicine. You've got this! Love and light from Chicago!",
