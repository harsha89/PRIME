      "Content": "There's a dissertation in this. Right now my global priority would be to keep healthcare accessible. The trend of hospitals in rural and under served areas closing is alarming. Everyone should have at least an Emergency/family practice facility with basics within 45 minutes of their home with a way to get to higher-acuity treatment quickly. Patient-focused facilities. The patient should always be the focus of the encounter, be it inpatient or outpatient. This should carry through to facility design, communications, privacy, wait times, courtesy of staff. Infection Control. Hand washing, sufficient time for housekeeping to thoroughly clean rooms, staff staying home when sick. As someone who has worked in facilities design of academic medical centers for three decades, it is a fine line and all too many who dream up projects put patients behind cost, staff convenience and space constraints. I try to always keep patients at the fore, and then make sure that staff (particularly nursing staff in inpatient settings) has input into their work environment. Beth",
