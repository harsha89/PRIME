      "Content": "Good morning Yes, mets to the pleura - diagnosed because of pleural effusion, the pleural effusion was drained twice but now that the chemo/hercptin/perjeta is working the pleural effusion has gone. I'm not clear what pleural consolidation is, but I agree that if the nodes haven't changed that's got to be good - I've got an area that still shows up on CT scans but Oncologist thinks it could be scare tissue from the biopsy etc, good luck with treatment Kathy",

I\u2019m doing CBD oil too - again a lot on here about that - consensus being I think that it doesn\u2019t cure cancer but helps with low level pain - I think it helps me sleep :-) Kathy",

      "Content": "Hi Grace I\u2019m on Herceptin and Perjeta too and they do keep a lot of people going for a long time - but as and when they don\u2019t seem to be working any more there are lots of other options. Could also be the bone mets were always there but just noticed now - my experience was that they only picked up the bone mets to spine when they were going/gone - as I understand it the spaces where they were will always be visible - ( I\u2019m on xgeva too for bone mets - make sure you get your teeth checked if they didn\u2019t already tell you that as dental work is problematic on xgeva ) so it might be that the bone mets are not signs of treatment not working - all the best Kathy xx",

      "Content": "Dear Angelica Agree with what people say, I work in mental health and would agree with the value of both those small steps towards feeling as though it's manageable if not normal yet - like walking each day, doing ten minutes of yoga, meeting a friend etc, but also counselling/therapy. I go private for therapy so she's not connecting to the health services and I think that's probably easier because we can talk about the treatment expereinces etc from a distance and she can feel like she's really on my side - my counsellor has experience of chronic illness too which helps - if you can find anyone who gets this then it's got to be useful - so then I guess this site helps enormously too - because it's the only place where people really do get it Kathy (Wales)",
