Whereas I didn't find anything specific relative to crossing the bbb, the interesting thing to note is that certain drugs that appear not to cross the bbb can still be effective against brain mets for reasons that are as yet unclear to scientists. This was something I learned while watching at the FDA\u2019s March 22, 2019 forum entitled, \u201cProduct Development for Central Nervous System (CNS) Metastases,\u201d where it was disclosed that penetration across the intact BBB is not required for a drug to exhibit a degree of efficacy in treating brain metastases. This represents a considerable paradigm shift, and several drugs that do not freely penetrate an intact BBB yet display antitumor efficacy were used as examples (including Lapatinib, Pembrolizumab, Capecitabine, TDM-1, and others).

Dexamethasone (Decadron): Although not a cancer treatment in and of itself, a steroid called Dexamethasone is given to patients with brain metastasis (often at the time of diagnosis) to reduce cerebral edema (swelling). That said, Dexamethasone may bind to a segment of DNA that may activate genes associated with drug resistance and poor patient outcomes, so alternative anti-inflammatories should be considered. From: http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2015-10/osuw-ssn100615.php It may be worthwhile to speak with the doctor about Boswellia Serrata (BS). It is used to help relieve edema (swelling). In one study, 44 patients with primary or secondary malignant cerebral tumors were randomly assigned to radiotherapy plus either BS or placebo. Blood samples were taken to analyze the serum concentration of boswellic acids (AKBA and KBA). Compared with baseline, a reduction of cerebral edema of more than 75% was found in 60% of patients receiving BS, and in only 26% of patients receiving placebo. These findings may be based on an additional antitumor effect. There were no severe adverse events in either group. BS did not have a significant impact on quality of life or cognitive function. Therefore, Boswellia Serrata could potentially be steroid-sparing for patients receiving brain irradiation. From: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21287538",

Here's a recap I put together: Those who received taselisib (GDC-0032) and Faslodex had a 30% lower risk of cancer worsening than those who received fulvestrant plus placebo, but taselisib with Faslodex extended PFS by a median of just two months over placebo (7.4 months vs. 5.4 months, respectively). Side effects, especially gastrointestinal toxicities, were troubling. The incidence of all grades of diarrhea was 60.1% for the taselisib arm vs. 19.7% for placebo. Hyperglycemia represented another frequent adverse event (AE), with an incidence (all grades) of 40.4% among those who received taselisib compared to 9.4% in the placebo arm. Among a subset of Alpelisib patients in the SOLAR-1 trial with PIK3CA mutations, the median PFS was 11.0 months for those who received the Alpelisib with Faslodex combination compared with 5.7 months for those who received placebo plus Faslodex. Those results, assessed after a median follow-up of 20 months, translated into a 35% reduction in the risk of progression or death. Diarrhea of grade 3 occurred in 6.7% of patients in the alpelisib\u2013fulvestrant group, as compared with 0.3% of those in the placebo\u2013fulvestrant group; no diarrhea of grade 4 was reported.

      "Content": "The PI3K (or PIK3CA) mutation is frequently found in metastatic breast cancer tumors, and it can be diagnosed via a liquid biopsy or a tumor biopsy. Until recently, there has not been an approved therapy targeting this mutation. The good news is that Alpelisib, an oral PI3K inhibitor, was FDA-approved in May 2019 for the treatment of postmenopausal women (and men) with HR-positive, HER2-negative, PIK3CA-mutated MBC following progression on or after a hormonal therapy regimen. Alpelisib's approval was based upon the SOLAR-1 Phase 3 clinical trial which compared Faslodex plus Alpelisib versus Faslodex plus placebo in postmenopausal patients with PIK3CA mutations that were found via liquid or tumor biopsy. Patients in the Faslodex/Alpelisib arm fared substantially better (median PFS 11.0 months) than similar patients in the Faslodex plus placebo arm (median PFS 5.7 months). Patients in this trial had received 1 or more lines of prior hormonal therapy but no chemotherapy. The Overall Response Rate in the PIK3CA-mutant cohort was 26.6% in the Faslodex/Alpelisib arm compared with 12.8% in the Faslodex/placebo arm. These results, assessed after a median follow-up of 20 months, translated into a 35% reduction in the risk of progression or death in favor of Faslodex/Alpelisib arm. (There was no advantage to providing Alpelisib in patients without a PIK3CA mutation). The FDA has also approved the companion diagnostic test \u201cTherascreen PIK3CA RGQ PCR Kit\u201d to detect the PIK3CA mutation in a tissue and/or a liquid biopsy. Patients whose results are negative by the Therascreen test using the liquid biopsy are encouraged to undergo tumor biopsy for PIK3CA mutation testing.

      "Content": "First, I'd like to thank Dr. Krumholz for reaching out to patients regarding their firsthand experience with hospitals. The points raised herein are insightful, and I just have a few things to add. 1. Keep patients advised about wait times to see the medical practitioner, and if they are running very late, contact the patient at home to advise them about the delay. 2. For those who are in-patients, improve the quality of food by adding a variety of healthier offerings including freshly-cut fruits, steamed fresh vegetables, and whole grains. Also offer soy and almond milks so that those who are lactose intolerant can have viable alternatives. And of course provide gluten-free options. 3. Although my local hospitals do a great job of this, others may not: Keep family members apprised during surgery as to how things are going. This should be done at least once if the surgery is 1.5 hours or more, and more often if longer. 4. Inform the patient and family regarding what to expect next. Who will see them, when will they be seen, and for what purpose? What symptoms and/or side effects might they have? What follow up will be undertaken and by whom? 5. I know this may sound trivial, but it would be nice to have magazines and books available while waiting. And not just \"Golf Digest!\" 6. Let the patient know what their out-of-pocket costs will be. Too often we receive a complex bill or statement of expenses and don't know what needs to be paid vs. what was covered by insurance. 7. Ensure that every patient leaving the hospital, along with their caregiver(s), has the contact number of a professional in the event of an emergency. This should not merely be the hospital's main number. 8. Whenever a patient is discharged after undergoing a procedure, follow up by phone the next day and possibly thereafter to ascertain the patient's status and answer questions (my hospitals do this, but I'm not sure if others receive this valuable service). 9. After a procedure, discharge instructions should be provided in the language the patient speaks. 10. Whenever a patient visits the hospital, they should be asked about their level of pain and about what other symptoms they maybe having. If the patient is in pain or experiencing other issues, a palliative care team should be assembled to ensure that their condition improves. I believe that this is vital for all patients. Thank you.",

      "Content": "The annual American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) conference encompasses multiple types of cancer, and this year many abstracts were submitted about metastatic breast cancer (MBC). I\u2019ve reviewed the abstracts and taken the liberty of pasting information about those that were not previously in my book, \u201cThe Insider\u2019s Guide to Metastatic Breast Cancer.\u201d To order the book from Amazon or download the complimentary .pdf, you are welcome to visit: https://www.insidersguidembc.com For hormone receptor positive, HER2 negative patients, a key question has been whether Verzenio (Abemaciclib) can be effective after prior failure on Ibrance or Kisqali. Based upon the two small studies provided below, the answer appears to be Yes although more robust studies are called for. Hopefully there\u2019ll be more to come in June after the conference, and I hope you find this helpful! 1. For Hormone Receptor Positive, HER2 Negative MBC Taking Verzenio after Prior Failure on Ibrance or Kisqali: Ibrance, Kisqali and Verzenio are CDK4/6 inhibitors, although Verzenio works somewhat differently. A small study of 19 evaluable heavily pre-treated HR+ HER2- MBC patients conducted by the Moffitt Cancer Center concluded that Verzenio elicited a response in a significant number of patients who previously took Ibrance in combination with endocrine therapy. The study participants had previously received a mean of 5.6 prior therapies, and 73.6% had visceral involvement (including brain metastasis in 26%). 15 of the study patients were given Verzenio in combination with endocrine therapy and 4 patients received Verzenio as a single agent. The median Progression Free Survival (PFS) on Verzenio was 7.0 months, and although no partial or complete responses were observed, 33% of the patients had stable disease. From: https://meetinglibrary.asco.org/record/177494/abstract From Feb. 2015 to Jan. 2019, a somewhat larger study evaluated clinical outcomes in patients with HR+/HER2- MBC who received Verzenio after progressing on Ibrance or Kisqali. 20 (34%) of the patients on Verzenio had disease progression in less than 3 months, while 21 patients (36%) had a treatment duration exceeding 6 months - including 10 patients who remained on treatment at interim analysis (range 181-413 days). The median PFS on Verzenio following a prior CDK4/6 inhibitor was 5.8 months. Interestingly, a preliminary analysis of circulating free DNA revealed RB1 and FGFR1 alterations in patients who exhibited progressive disease. From: https://meetinglibrary.asco.org/record/175766/abstract Phase 1 study of Lenvatinib and Letrozole: Lenvatinib, an approved drug that is used to treat liver, thyroid, and kidney cancer, is currently being studied against other types of cancer. It works by inhibiting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which is a signal protein produced by cells that stimulates the formation of blood vessels that in turn promote tumor growth. In a very small study that included 12 MBC patients (8 of whom had prior therapy with a CDK4/6 inhibitor and endocrine therapy), lenvatinib combined with letrozole elicited an overall disease control rate (DCR) of 92% after 12 weeks. (Anne\u2019s note: Although not explicitly stated in the abstract, it is assumed that all 12 patients had hormone receptor positive disease, although it is unclear whether they were also HER2 negative). From: https://meetinglibrary.asco.org/record/175824/abstract Potential Impact of Being on a CDK4/6 Inhibitor before Moving on to Afinitor: A small study examined the medical records of 33 patients who underwent therapy with Afinitor and Aromasin (A/A). 17 of the patients had prior CDK4/6 inhibitor therapy combined with endocrine therapy and 16 had taken either letrozole or arimidex alone. In patients who had previously received a CDK4/6 inhibitor, the PFS was 5.7 months vs. 4.7 months in patients who had taken letrozole or arimidex alone. The median overall survival of patients who\u2019d had a prior CDK4/6 inhibitor was 17.8 months vs. 11.4 months for those who had only taken letrozole or arimidex. The study concluded that A/A was effective for patients who had previously received CDK4/6 inhibitor therapy and for those who had received prior therapy with an aromatase inhibitor alone. From: https://meetinglibrary.asco.org/record/177375/abstract 2. For HER2 Positive MBC Prognostic Factors Relative to HER2 Positive Patients: A Canadian study evaluated the clinical characteristics of 119 evaluable patients with HER2+ MBC and an unusually prolonged response to anti-HER2 therapy. The patients had been treated with either: 1) Herceptin, Perjeta, and a taxane 2) Herceptin plus chemotherapy, or 3) TDM-1. Patients with median duration of response that was 2 times higher than the Phase 2 or 3 trials for each regimen were included in the study due to their prolonged response. 41% of these patients were NED (No Evidence of Disease) and 59% had residual disease. It was determined that patients who were NED were generally under the age of 50 and had never had breast surgery. Patients who were NED enjoyed relative longevity when compared with patients who had residual disease. Treatment type and number of organs with metastases were deemed to be merely of borderline significance. From: https://meetinglibrary.asco.org/record/176119/abstract Conversely, the Cleveland Clinic evaluated 47 HER2+ patients, many of whom also had hormone receptor positive disease. 17 patients (36%) had a mastectomy after diagnosis of stage IV breast cancer. The two-year OS (Overall Survival) for the 17 patients who had a mastectomy was 94%, and the two-year OS for the 30 patients with no mastectomy was 50%. The study concluded that on univariable analysis (as a single statistical variable), only mastectomy vs no mastectomy predicted OS, and that on multivariable analysis, mastectomy vs no mastectomy remained a statistically significant predictor of OS. The study furthermore determined that age, chemotherapy, HER2-directed therapy, and breast radiation were not independent predictors of improved OS. From: https://meetinglibrary.asco.org/record/177083/abstract 3. General: Low Dose Metronomic Chemotherapy: In a retrospective case-control-analysis, the effectiveness of low dose metronomic chemotherapy (LDMC) was compared with conventionally-administered chemotherapy in 105 MBC patients taking cytoxan and methotrexate. Of the 35 patients taking LDMC, 31% had a disease control rate (DCR) at 6 months vs. 26% of the 70 patients taking conventional chemotherapy. In the TNBC MBC group, 30% of the LDMC patients showed a DCR vs. 5% of the patients in the control group. From: https://meetinglibrary.asco.org/record/171918/abstract Edited May 25, 2019 at 3:29 pm",

      "Content": "I'm sorry to hear that you're dealing with TNBC MBC, and wanted to provide an excerpt about therapies from my book, \"The Insider's Guide to Metastatic Breast Cancer.\" Sequence of Therapy for TNBC MBC Patients in the US: If the patient\u2019s tumor has immune cells on or near it that are PD-L1 positive, then the patient should receive Atezolizumab (Tecentriq) with Abraxane. Atezolizumab is an immunotherapy drug that works well in combination with chemotherapy. Atezolizumab was closely studied in the IMPassion130 trial, which determined that MBC patients whose tumors expressed PD-L1 had a median Overall Survival of 25 months on Atezolizumab with Abraxane, vs. 15.5 months on Abraxane alone. As a result, in March 2019 the FDA granted accelerated approval to Atezolizumab in combination with Abraxane for TNBC patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic disease whose tumors express PD-L1 (PD-L1 stained tumor-infiltrating immune cells of any intensity covering â‰¥ 1% of the tumor area), as determined by an FDA-approved test. The FDA has also approved the VENTANA PD-L1 (SP142) Assay as a companion diagnostic device for selecting TNBC patients for this therapy. From: https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/InformationOnDrugs/ApprovedDrugs/ucm633065.htm If the patient\u2019s tumor-related immune cells are PD-L1 negative, then sequential single agent chemotherapy is recommended (as per materials provided at SABCS 2018). It was likewise advised that combination chemotherapy should only be given in the event of visceral crisis (severe organ dysfunction). For HER2 negative MBC patients in the US with BRCA germline mutations, Talazoparib and Olaparib have been approved. Halaven Chemotherapy for TNBC: Relative to existing FDA-approved chemotherapy, in a Phase 3 multicenter study, women with metastatic TNBC had a more significant response to treatment with Halaven (Eribulin) versus Xeloda. Additional Phase 3 trials substantiated the effectiveness of Halaven over standard treatment. The two studies showed an overall improvement in survival of 5 months for metastatic breast cancer patients with TNBC. From[42, PMID:28141030]: http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/11/141102212054.htm Platinum Chemotherapy (such as Carboplatin and Cisplatin) for TNBC: Many people with TNBC may respond well to platinum chemotherapy drugs. TNBC patients with Homologous Recombination\u2013Deficient (HRD) tumors, which have lost the ability to repair double-stranded DNA breaks, may possibly have a more favorable response to DNA-damaging drugs such as platinum agents and PARP (poly ADP-ribose polymerase) inhibitors. Furthermore, the presence of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), a type of white blood cell, ahead of treatment may help predict a favorable response to platinum-based chemotherapy (and possibly other therapies, such as immunotherapy) in women with triple-negative breast cancer. From[43; 44; PMID:25476537] and [194, PMID:23012302]: http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/releases/270261.php and http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/releases/276870.php and http://www.ascopost.com/issues/january-25-2016/homologous-recomb... Although a patient\u2019s HER2 status may be negative as per their pathology report, in some cases HER2-directed treatment may be viable, and this situation is being studied. For example, the experimental drug trastuzumab deruxtecan elicited a response in patients with HER2 low expression (1+ or 2+) whose In Situ Hybridization (ISH) test results classified their status as HER2 negative. (Additional information about trastuzumab deruxtecan and other cutting edge research for TNBC is located under Research and Potential Therapies for HER2 Negative MBC in the bpook, \"The Insider's Guide to Metastatic Breast Cancer\").",

      "Content": "Greetings, Great news! TNBC MBC patients whose tumors express PD-L1 (PD-L1 stained tumor-infiltrating immune cells of any intensity covering â‰¥ 1% of the tumor area) may be eligible to receive Atezolizumab (Tecentriq) with Abraxane. Atezolizumab is an immunotherapy drug that works well in combination with chemotherapy. Atezolizumab was closely studied in the IMPassion130 trial, which determined that TNBC MBC patients whose tumors expressed PD-L1 had a median Overall Survival of at least 25 months on Atezolizumab with Abraxane, vs. 15.5 months on Abraxane alone. As a result, in March 2019 the FDA granted accelerated approval to Atezolizumab in combination with Abraxane for TNBC patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic disease whose tumors express PD-L1. The FDA has also approved the VENTANA PD-L1 (SP142) Assay as a companion diagnostic device for selecting TNBC patients for this therapy. From: https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/InformationOnDrugs/ApprovedDrugs/ucm633065.htm This newly-released information has been incorporated into my book, \u201cThe Insider\u2019s Guide to Metastatic Breast Cancer\u201d which is available in paperback and eBook formats on Amazon at https://www.amazon.com/Insiders-Guide-Metastatic-Breast-Cancer/dp/179586060 X A complimentary .pdf is available by emailing me at bestbird@hotmail.com With best wishes!

It has been written up in my book, \"The Insider's Guide to Metastatic Breast Cancer\" which is available in paperback and eBook formats as well as in a complimentary .pdf. If interested, please visit https://www.insidersguidembc.com Trastuzumab Deruxtecan (DS-8201) is a novel drug consisting of a HER2 antibody attached to a \u201ctopoisomerase I inhibitor\u201d (a new class of anticancer agents that interrupt DNA replication in cancer cells). The recent Phase 2 DESTINY BreastO1 clinical trial studied trastuzumab deruxtecan in 115 patients with unresectable and/or metastatic cancer who had previously received a median 7 lines of therapy including Herceptin and Kadcyla (as well as Perjeta in most cases). The patients in the study had either: HER2-positive breast cancer, HER2\u2013low expressing breast cancer (considered HER2 negative), HER2-positive gastric cancer, or various other HER2-expressing solid tumors. Data revealed that the overall response rate with trastuzumab deruxtecan was 59.5% and the disease control rate was an impressive 93.7%. The median duration of response was 20.7 months, the median progression-free survival was 22.1 months, and the median overall survival has not yet been reached. From: https://www.targetedonc.com/news/fam-trastuzumab-deruxtecan-demo... As of May 2019, there are three recruiting clinical trials of trastuzumab deruxtecan for MBC patients.",

      "Content": "SueG, I'd never heard the term lymphangitic carcinomatosis before and looked it up. It's a condition in which cancer cells spread from the primary tumor and invade lymph vessels (thin tubes that carry lymph and white blood cells through the body\u2019s lymph system). The invaded lymph vessels then fill up with cancer cells and become blocked. Although lymphangitic carcinomatosis can occur anywhere in the body, it commonly happens in the lungs. It can happen in many types of cancer but is most common in breast, lung, colon, stomach, pancreatic, and prostate cancer. Also called carcinomatous lymphangitis. A quick Google search about the condition provided similar information to that which you found. I'd suggest seeking a second professional opinion if possible about the eribulin and potentially other treatment options. Also, if your tumor has specific mutations or you have a germline BRCA mutation, you may be a candidate for additional (targeted) therapies. Perhaps a liquid biopsy may be useful in this regard. I hope you'll be written up as an unusual and wonderful case of a person with this condition who made an excellent recovery!",
