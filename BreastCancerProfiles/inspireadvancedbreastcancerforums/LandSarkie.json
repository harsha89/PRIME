    "Content": "For me, the key is finding doctors I can trust and building a good relationship with them. When I'm getting to know a doctor, I may make certain statements or ask questions I already know the answer to because I am interested in how they respond. I depend on having clear communication from someone who is willing to explain things to me in a way that respects my intelligence and ability to participate in the decision making process. When I am moving beyond a routine medical situation into something more significant, it is important for me to be able to identify who the experts in that particular are (practitioners and facilities) and seek information and treatment from those sources. Both of my cancer scares brought me to the nearest NCI cancer center as I didn't see any benefit to sticking with my local doctors. However, for my sarcoidosis treatment, while I did travel to the Cleveland Clinic after my initial diagnosis to get their input in designing a treatment plan, since then I have gotten care from local doctors. If my sarcoidosis changes in a significant way, I'll be back at the Cleveland Clinic, though, in order to understand the change and adjust my treatment plan. While I do look at some medical studies, I do so with the understanding that I don't have the medical knowledge or experience to reliably differentiate between studies that are well-designed and have reliable results and those that do not. So I depend on the guidance of the doctors to inform me and direct me to good research. I like to read a couple of blogs written by medical professionals who advocate science-based medicine. They are helping me to better understand how to evaluate the quality of scientific research. I like to listen to Doctor Radio in order to help build my understanding of issues in medicine. Then there is my own common sense and ability to think logically. Sometimes that proves to be invaluable in trying to make sense of the situation in which you find yourself.",
