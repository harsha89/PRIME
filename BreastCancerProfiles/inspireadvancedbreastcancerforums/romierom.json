      "Content": "I have been on taxol since Nov 2018. It clear up my bone metastasis but it\u2019s not working on my ascites. Hair started thinning, very tired, neuropathy in finger tips and toes. Food taste like metal, heartburn some nausea ( it started last week for the first time just one day). Onc said I would be on chemo indefinitely. Very sad. I continue to work three days a week and exercise. I also have A port. Take care blessings be unto you.",
