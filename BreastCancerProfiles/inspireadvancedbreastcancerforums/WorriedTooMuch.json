I don't expect the general population to understand how we feel, but sure glad to know that I am not alone. I have tried to \"live\" with this, but at times, I go to that place of despair and fear. I think the prognosis for us all is relatively good with the advances they are making, so we all need to hang on tight for that day, which I believe will come in our lifetimes.",

      "Content": "Hi everyone! I went to Memorial Sloan Kettering and found out the treatment I am getting at my small-town oncologist's office is the best treatment I can get. They took some blood and are testing biopsy samples against it - both from my 2016 mastectomies and my 2018 pleural fluid, to seek out gene markers, etc. that may help me in the future. This is called genomic sequence testing. They are also testing me again for HER-2, as well. I have been negative both times, but apparently it can surface at any time? That was news to me. Otherwise, the trip was lengthy, expensive, and a little difficult. I was able to walk 4 city blocks and did not get short of breath; pretty remarkable for someone who has pleural mets and smokes...but that's another blog post. I am so glad I went. All is stable right now, and my PET showed decreased uptake in all pleural metastases. so Ibrance is working. Now onto the \"He called me sir\" portion of this post. I was at Home Depot this morning with my husband and yes, like most home improvement shoppers, I was dressed in jeans and a sweatshirt and had my head down talking on my cell to my oncology pharmacy who has threatened to stop sending my meds if my cancer center doesn't respond to their prescription request. However, I was wearing a pink sweatshirt, wearing a silver jacket and carrying a pink purse! When he said, \"Excuse me, sir,\" I turned and looked and thought it was meant for my husband who was standing at the paint counter. As many you may have read in a prior blog of mine, I am not too impressed with the physiologic changes of this disease. Survivors and stage IV's alike, none of us get to keep all of our original equipment in the name of saving our life. Feeling very annoyed seeing that there was no \"man\" standing there, I said rather defensively, \"I am a woman.\" The guy didn't care, either. He just kept on going. It stopped my day dead in its tracks. I began to worry about everything and anything associated with this diagnosis. Perhaps it was coming off a long trip to NYC, 5 hours by train, which was more like 8 hours on the way home due to a disabled train. Or, perhaps it was because my oncologist, who knows my PET is improved, still wants to do a brain MRI, which was ordered today, because of my tumor marker going up 30 points. For whatever reason, I just had a \"poor me\" Kind of day after that encounter. I contacted my local cancer center, who, by the way, does a hell of a great job caring for me, and got the Ibrance prescription mess cleared up. I got my favorite burgundy paint for the guest bath that my husband has hired someone to do. I even was able to work a few hours this afternoon and evening and found out I am getting a raise. My day actually ended on a high note, but yet something still nags at me: We are supposed to try and live the so-called \"new normal\" in our lives. The women in the Ibrance and Versenio ads are never shown arguing with the mail order pharmacy to get their meds; they aren't shown being run through a gammit of tests, and lastly, they are not shown the pain of being referred to as \"sir\" because their hair has thinned from treatment. How can we all live a \"new normal\" without all of these intrusions reminding us that we are, in fact sick? People have told me, \"You don't LOOK sick at all.\" Great, glad to hear it. However, I am. I walk around in personal pain, which sometimes is expressed as anger at very little. My doctor tells me it is the Faslodex that makes me flare, but I am afraid that I am afraid, and that's what makes me flare. For all of my beloved stage IV long-term survivors on this blog, may I ask you when you get to be somewhat normal again? When do the intrusive appointments, tests, and doctor office visits end so that you can try and live with this without reminders? Thanks for letting me vent. Very few people understood why I was so upset by a careless remark by a stranger in Home Depot, but I know you good people on here get it.",

      "Content": "Ah, tumor markers. The first was right after diagnosis and was 198, which was high. I had a slight drop, but they are rising exponentially every 2 weeks! I liken my \"obsession\" about a number, which I don't truly understand fully, to the stock market, which I also do not understand. You put a few bucks in there and pick up the paper religiously to see how the stock is doing until you're either overly concerned; to the point of uncertainty, or jumping for joy at potential gains that may only hold water for a couple of days If the emotions of a stage IV diagnosis aren't enough, those numbers started adversely affecting my life, hence the screen name \"Worries Too Much,\" which sums me up perfectly. One of my recent tests was on the heels of a trip to my surgeon for general followup. When I told her about the recurrence, she was all gloom and doom. Perhaps it is because I was deemed by her as \"free of disease,\" despite the fact that her nurse practitioner \"palpated something on my chest\" and requested an ultrasound, to which my physician said, \"Nothing to worry about. Just scar tissue from the implants. That was October 14, 2018. On December 13, 2018, I was in ICU with lungs that were obliterated with bloody-fluid containing metastatic breast cancer. The tumor markers are/were dictating my life. When it goes up, I get depressed and start worrying in great detail about my mortality, which I am sure many patients do, but it was affecting my quality of life, as well, made me irritable and angry at the disease. I had to change my thinking if I was going to get through this, which I have. A nurse oncology case manager from my insurance company was talking to me. As I started to cry about the increased tumor marker, she said something that made sense: She does not dispute that they have \"some\" utility in detecting progression, they are not an exact science, and in fact sometimes are out of whack for a host of other reasons NOT related to progression. But more importantly, she told me to go by how I FELT, not the number. Truth is, I feel better than ever. The shortness of breath has decreased. A tightness in my upper abdomen that was bending me in half is now gone. My labs rebound after each cycle of Ibrance. I am, for all intents and purposes, doing well. I listened cautiously because I think she's pretty smart, but I am also a skeptic and thought maybe she was holding back. I knew that these were my perceptions, not actual events. I am due for a PET Scan 05/21; first since starting the Ibrance, which to me, is the truest way to determine disease status. Still, I had to change my thinking. The ways I've learned to overcome this hurdle is to accept the unacceptable. I have accepted that I now have cancer again; that is for sure. The hardest part to accept is what this disease is going to do - will it progress? will it regress will I ever enjoy another remission? As I cannot accept or deal with the uncertainty, at least for now, the same holds true for the tumor markers. They are a slice of the whole picture. Scans and symptoms are the only true measurement of treatment success or failure. My regimen is being changed again because of other complimentary tests which shows my receptors have changed. Didn't even know that was possible. Will it work? I hope so. My doctor is in charge, thank goodness. She has told me NOT to read the patient portal reports because she'd rather talk to me first. Now, about that stock market...anyone care to explain the psychology of that.",

My white count, H&H and platelets decrease in a similar pattern with each cycle, rebounding only slightly with the 7-day off period. The only reason my onc. hasn't considered Versenio for me is because studies on it have not been out long enough, I guess, to test its efficacy.

      "Content": "This morning, before my weekly blood work/monthly Faslodex shots, I attended the funeral of a friend of mine from church. His wife and I are good friends and for a variety of reasons, he chose to take his own life on Holy Thursday, but today was his memorial. The thing about suicide is that I believe it is a choice a person makes for a host of reasons non-suicidal people can't possibly understand. Both times I was diagnosed, my friend and her husband were the first ones at my house with food and flowers. I was devastated when I found out he made the choice, and like many people have said - \"I never saw it coming.\" Even his own wife didn't see it, nor did his children or friends. After the funeral when my husband and I were driving to about my 50th appointment for followup and care, I started to think how hard we're fighting to live. Tests, scans, chemo drugs and their side effects, countless blood tests, etc. and we submit to all of it simply to stay alive. From the time we hear the word \"cancer,\" I believe all of us decide we're going to fight, win, and live no matter what it takes. That's the choice I've made twice. Never has it occurred to me to not fight, not use traditional medical therapy and a few non-traditional therapies, too. Never have I refused a test, surgery, or trip for a second opinion. No is not an option with this disease if you want to live. In fact, I had my Faslodex shots today and they hurt, and the nurses always \"apologize\" for it, but I always respond, \"I don't mind because it is a life-saving gift and it works,\" knowing that as recent as 15-20 years ago, they didn't have this for us or Ibrance. How lucky we are! My friend, Rob was 71. His autopsy showed he was still in excellent health, and no natural cause would have claimed his life. So they ruled out a medical illness as a probable cause for making this choice. I think the \"why\" of this will linger along with the memoriy of this wonderful man. At times, I feel like a shell of a person; something that is tested, medicated, and waiting in doctor's offices for hours, but yet, week after long week, I make the choice to attempt to preserve the life that I believe God gave to me. There are many times when I say to myself, \"Is it all worth it?\" I take the Ibrance and my \"new normal\" has been really hard to deal with, but yet I do those labs, those tests, and everyhing the doctor requests in the name of preserving my life. I was devastated that Rob made the choice to die because of unbearable emotional pain. We've all experienced emotional pain, too, but yet we don't stop trying. I do not believe Rob's choice was an easy one, and I even thought for a few minutes that it sure would be a quick end to my problems, but that isn't true, either. Cancer has been an intrusive, disruptive and difficult diagnosis for me - both times. The \"monster\", as I like to call it, poses us each with a choice - are we going to fight, or not? After several hours of contemplating this today, I made my choice. I am going to live and see this through. There's new treatments on the horizon for us. We are walking a path which can make an unexpected turn at any moment. But, I believe that it can be eradicated, and I believe I have chosen to continue to fight and live. I hope that you all have decided the same because each and every one of you have contributed to someone's life and mean so much to many, including me, and I hope that you, too, are choosing life freely.",

      "Content": "Tonight's journal is about the bizarre things people have said to me during the course of my disease. Out of the gate, I was stage III-C; lots of lymph nodes and a big mass in my left breast. I knew my treatment was going to be aggressive. Right before my surgery, I went to Mass and afterwards, people had heard (small town - lots of caring people), and a guy approached me and said, \"My wife had it. She had no lymph nodes, so we thought we'd get spared, but she died.\" Um, thanks? As we all know on these boards, that first diagnosis is the worst diagnosis. I took it worse than when I was told I was stage IV. The nurse navigator at my surgeon's office said to another nurse, right in front of me, \"Yeah, she was a real basket case!\". I said in response, \"Being told you have advanced-stage breast cancer is not the BEST news I've ever gotten.\" She turned red and then started to try and suck up to me. She had been there from the beginning, and I had conversations about my fears with her, and she said THAT! I felt like my confidence was betrayed. When I became stage IV, the doctor told me as I sat in my ICU bed, and I said, \"Ok, where do we go from here treatment-wise,\" to which he responded, \"You're taking this remarkably well; you're strong.\" I guess a lot changed between the 1st and 2nd diagnosis. When I wrote the navigator an e-mail telling her about my advanced disease, I commented, \"You'd have been really proud of me. I didn't even shed a tear this time.\" I felt compelled to say that because of how she'd been previously. It wasn't a shot; it was now a fact. PET/CT scans are difficult because I have had so many procedures, they can't tell mets from hardware! At my recent PET, I presented the secretary with a list of procedures so the radiologist had a guide and she said, \"Well, looks like standard breast cancer treatment to me, it's not needed.\" I said, \"You have to put that in my chart, please, and if not, I will fax it to Radiology myself.\" She said, \"I guess we can scan it in, if you think it's needed.\" Of course I think it's needed. She had on a lab coat, so I assumed she was trained in some form or fashion about PET scans - Nope, you just need a high school diploma to do the job she's doing. I have a scan 5/21/19, so she'd better be prepared to rescan my procedure sheet again. Funny, the radiologist who interpreted my PET started out the report by saying, \"I wish to thank the patient for providing additional clinical information. It was very helpful in determining what was scar tissue.\" She can SCAN that into my chart, too. In 1998, I lost my oldest sister to an aggressive form of cancer; it was the worst. Oddly enough, I was working in Radiation Oncology at the same time she was going through it. When she passed, several patients came to calling hours to comfort me. I knew that I didn't want to discourage them. I went out of my way to say, \"What happened to my sister is very rare; it's not the same as it is for you.\" I don't believe that I ever talked to a patient or family member matter-of-fact, and certainly didn't make them feel hopeless. As we all know, hope is a huge part of this process. I saw my surgeon in follow-up just a few weeks ago. The way she talked (mind you, she hasn't seen the inside of my body since 2016, nor has she thoroughly read the reports of my medical oncologist), it was like a bad philosophy course at the community college, saying \"No one knows why, who or how it happens. It just happens. The last statement made no sense. After all, there are all kinds of treatments and things they can do now, so someone definitely knew the how and why. She continued, \"Eat that cheeseburger, drink that wine. I've seen 30-year-old women die from this, so you shouldn't bother trying diets, supplements; they don't work.\" Um, thanks! I was depressed for a week, but thanks to the great people on this board, once again I can face it and be somewhat optimistic about my future, and feeling as if indeed, I have a future. To all of the women and men on this Board, let me begin by saying that ALL comments you've left for me have been nothing but encouraging and positive. I truly appreciate the support I get on this forum, which is why I visit it nightly when I can't fall asleep as I should. Of course, none of us know what the future holds, but when people say silly things, don't walk away - RUN!! I've kept as quiet as possible about this diagnosis solely because I can't take the comments people make. In fact, my sister said to me, \"Suzie, let's try and keep this one quiet so that you don't have to hear STUPID things like last time!\" Thanks for reading this. I am deriving significant therapeutic benefit from blogging my experiences. I appreciate that you take the time to leave comments and help me make sense of this from the same or similar point-of-view.",

      "Content": "Tonight after I finished working, I began to fill out paperwork for my mother. She is 86 and has dementia from a stroke she had in 2018. My family wants her kept home, so me and my 3 sisters take turns staying at her house 24/7. I actually recurred in the middle of all of this in December 2018, and was having symptoms at times when I was at her house. I was hospitalized for 5 days for a pleural effusion and I told her it was pneumonia. I have made a conscious decision not to tell her, as we lost a sister to cancer in 1998. This was a surprisingly easy moral and ethical decision for me. She would not fully understand or remember it, and I felt I didn't want that stress on her as well. Sisters and caregivers and providers agree with this approach, so although I don't need their approval, I do want their support in the form of keeping quiet. Ironically, I am sicker than my mom. The first time I went through this she was still herself and handled it reasonably well. I felt guilty about lying to go have a biopsy the first time, and spilled it a few days later. She had been through this herself and reassured me I would be okay. During my remission and at the start of her dementia, she was diagnosed with Stage I triple negative cancer. Her first was hormone-positive. The decision was not to treat with chemo, as it yielded little value and she had no nodes, either. Plus, at the age of 85, it would be slow-growing. She had a mastectomy and lymph node dissection and did reasonably well; however, it was shortly after the surgery we began to notice behavioral changes in her, which turned out to be a temporal stroke. We have given up social activities, job opportunities, and even appointments (when I can get away with it), and I will be going to a cancer center soon for further investigation into my own cancer. My sisters are going to New York with me and we are telling her it is a pleasure trip. She will not know the difference. Every once in awhile her motherly intuition will spike and she'll say, \"Suzie are you really sick?\" I always reassure her I am fine. This is tough for me. Before the dementia struck, we were together all the time. I paid her bills, took her shopping, and groaned to her when my husband was being a pain. She was my rock, my sounding board, and I am lucky to have had her for 53 GOOD years. My sisters and husband have taken on her role and they are great to me, providing ample moral and physical support, but it is not the same without her. I am glad she's being spared, and I have no trouble fibbing as needed. On this Mother's Day weekend, I still remember how she made me dresses; took me shopping for school and Easter clothes; comforted me when guys dumped me, and helped plan my wedding. It isn't the same without her knowing, and that's okay. My Mother's Day gift to this wonderfully unselfish, utterly committed woman is the gift of not knowing. She has lost so much - parents, 3 siblings, best friend, a daughter and her husband. I think the least I can do is take her to brunch and keep it under my hat. Her appt. with the geriatric specialists will hopefully yield some positive results for both of us. I want to know how she feels and I want her to NOT know how I feel. Happy Mother's Day to those of you who were lucky enough to earn the title.",

If you are still concerned about your breast, go to a breast specialty clinic where they see this and do this a hundred times per week. I went to the Elizabeth Wende Breast Clinic in Rochester, NY, and was diagnosed the same day. Not only that, but the biopsy was done with little discomfort. You didn't mention other symptoms such as pain, swelling, or tingling down the arm, but I was stage III at diagnosis, so already pretty advanced. Trust your instincts and keep pushing if you're uncomfortable. An MRI may not be a bad idea for the breast, either. Keep us posted, please.",

My PET scan showed improvement in my plueral metastases and no new disease elsewhere, and my doctor is shocked. I told her I wasn't surprised. Yes, the meds are obviously working, but my head wasn't in a good place - until I came here. Knowing how my mind works, I was all gloom and doom and sat in shock for about 3 months, waiting for something to give. I am going to Sloane-Kettering, anyway, for additional treatment recommendations, but I know it was through the power of prayer, love and support of my Inspire friends who are doing so well, that I came to a place to being my healing. I will post and let you know what Sloane says now about my MBC, because we can all benefit from knowledge, but ever since I came to this board a few months ago, I have not been the same - just better every day. Thanks for the support and I will report on my visit to Memorial Sloane Kettering. Any questions or information I get, I'll share with everyone. Thank you again!",

My CA27.29 has gone from 198 to 260 in 3 months on Ibrance and Faslodex. If you're having the CA27.29, the \"normal\" is 36, so you are below normal, and yet you're in the same boat as me with mets. If we are having the same marker, this proves how inaccurate they truly are. You're like me - you go 3-4 days being ok, and then all of a sudden you remember, \"I'm stage IV.\" I think we are waiting for the other shoe to drop, but with all they are coming up with for MBC, we should be able to relax - a little at least.",
