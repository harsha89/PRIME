    "Content": "I started Verzenio at 100mgs 2x a day and have been on that dose since June. I was working well after 3 month scan. I haven't seen my latest scan, and I may have some progression, but even if that's the case, I got nine good months at least from the 100mg dose. Very minimal side effects except low blood counts and some fatigue.",
