    "Content": "By Radha_Inspire Digital Editor, Inspire Laura Pole, RN, MSN, is the Director of Nourishment Programs at the Smith Center for Healing and the Arts in Washington, D.C., a non-profit health, education, and arts organization, and senior researcher for Beyond Conventional Cancer Therapies, an open access, evidence-based resource for those interested in integrative cancer care. Pole trained and practiced as an oncology nurse before pursuing an interest in the science of food and nutrition to support cancer patients. We spoke with Pole about her work as a health-supportive chef. How would you describe what you do? I am a culinary translator. If someone has been told \u201cthis is the diet you need to eat\u201d, or they\u2019ve done their research and decided [how they] want to eat, I help them translate it in all the practical ways to get it to their plate and it tastes good. Whether it\u2019s teaching them to cook or shop or plan menus, working with someone else who\u2019s going to cook for them, or teaching them how to go out and eat if they aren\u2019t up for cooking. Nourishment is everything about food, from selecting and preparing it, to enjoying it, to digesting it, to it working with your body to take care of you. At what point do people come to you to address diet as part of cancer care? Sometimes we\u2019ll have people who from the get-go know they want to take an integrative approach to their care and they\u2019ll ask for help. But in the shock of a diagnosis and trying to do everything you can to figure out your treatment and get through it, we don\u2019t see too many seriously looking at diet until after [that]. I mostly get people who are done with treatment and now they want to know what they can do related to eating that will reduce the risk of recurrence. I like to help people understand [how to use] food and other healing practices to make the body inhospitable to cancer. The kind of eating pattern we\u2019re talking about is a primarily plant-based, whole foods diet \u2013 like eating apples with the skin vs drinking apple juice. How can food make the body inhospitable to cancer? We\u2019re now pretty sure that obesity is connected to at least 13 different cancers \u2013 it\u2019s getting as clear as smoking is clear[ly] related to cancer. The fat that accumulates is active, causing inflammation and interfering with the insulin system. Insulin resistance, which a lot of people with obesity have \u2013 but you can have it even if you\u2019re not obese \u2013 happens when you eat high glycemic load foods (refined flours, white pasta, white bread). Consider insulin like a real estate agent taking glucose into [cellular] homes\u2026 When you have more glucose than cells want to take up, cells become resistant to the insulin \u2013 that\u2019s insulin resistance \u2013 yet the pancreas is still kicking out insulin. Cancer cells will take the glucose, and the insulin says, \u201cI\u2019ll give you some growth factor while we\u2019re at it.\u201d That\u2019s the last thing you want! What questions could patients and caregivers ask of their primary caregivers or oncologists in order to get them to a nutrition-related resource? They could say something like: \u201cI feel like food and diet is going to be important to my healing. I plan to look into that. I wonder what your thoughts are on it?\u201d Whether your doctor knows about what you\u2019re exploring, it\u2019s important to let them know that you\u2019re doing it or you\u2019re thinking about it so they can flag concerns. There are a lot of sources and videos on the Internet that are out of date. You need to look for reliable sources. A lot of people don\u2019t know about the culinary translation piece. You can ask for a referral to an oncology dietician. There are doctors who practice integrative or more holistic medicine and we talk about how to find them [at the Smith Center]. You might want to work with a navigator who\u2019s trained in understanding integrative cancer care. There are a subgroup of naturopaths called naturopathic oncologists. If they are true to their profession, they will work cooperatively with your conventional medicine doctors\u2026 to help people with lifestyle practices, maybe supplements, complementary therapies, natural approaches, that will complement your conventional cancer treatment. How can eating well for cancer accommodate different cultures and food traditions? One thing you do is you go back to the roots of the food for that culture... what were the traditional foods? If you look at Latin American cuisine, if you look at African cuisine, there\u2019s a lot of health supportive foods in it. If you think about the Mediterranean diet, [which is] based on the cultures and ethnicities of the people who live on the Mediterranean, that\u2019s one of the most evidence-based diets for good health outcomes, including for cancer, heart disease, cardiovascular disease. I like [the writer] Michael Pollan\u2019s advice \u2013 eat real food, not too much, mostly plants. Is there anything else important to mention? I was getting to the end of a lecture when I talk about \u201cdelicious\u201d being a very important principle. [A French student] couldn\u2019t contain herself and she said: \u201cYou keep talking about the science but in my country, we love food, we enjoy it, it\u2019s pleasure! And that has to be good for you.\u201d I said you\u2019re right and maybe I should talk about that first. [Food] doesn\u2019t have to be like taking a bad medicine and it doesn\u2019t have to be complicated. And pleasure should be part of it. What resources help you stay updated on the latest thinking about cancer and diet? The American Institute for Cancer Research\u2019s Continuous Update Project (CUP) reports review literature for several cancers. I listen to [Five to Thrive Live!] on iThrive Radio where they interview an expert in some topic related to cancer, quite often related to diet. The Center for Mind-Body Medicine does trainings twice a year on food as medicine, and I have done that training and was on the faculty for some time.
