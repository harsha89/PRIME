At T2 (invasion in the muscle layer) it's about 50% (with chemo). The problem is that even at early stage there are cancer cells in the blood. Even at the premalignant stage the premalignant cells are found in the blood. And from there it's a matter of chance what they do next. About the competition between cells. I meant between different cancer cells in the tumor. Healthy cells cannot compete with cancer. They always loose. Even if you have a low grade tumor and some cells of high grade appeared there they will transform the whole tumor to high grade. High grade cells are more abnormal, more aggressive, they multiply faster, they press on normal tissues and penetrate them and create more acidic environment to kill normal cells. The acidosis is caused by lactic acid which is pumped out from cancer cells in the microenvironment. Normal cells don't produce lactic acid. Edited May 28, 2019 at 7:07 pm",

After a couple of other lines of therapy the sensitivity to the first drug might be restored because all drug resistant cells (to the first drug) are eliminated by other therapies. Congrats on the clear left lung. If there is a remaining cancer in the pleura that was not wiped out by your drug it might need a different drug. That's what we are talking about that not all cancer cells can be killed by any drug. The remaining cancer cells are the reason for recurrence.

Actually, it is happening every day as aberrations in our DNA happen every day. We have many mechanisms to fix them by DNA repair proteins, by mismatch repair proteins, by apoptotic proteins and by our immune cells. (I personally had once a spontaneous cancer regression. Then it came back again a decade later). But if these problems are not fixed by natural processes in our bodies then cancer cells proliferate. If DNA repair and apoptosis are damaged as happens in most cancers and the immune system cannot kill them because they express \"don't kill me signals\" or self signals or signals for immunotolerance. There are also fibroblasts that protect cancer too. They form a tight shield around tumors. An early stage tumor is easier to treat than a late stage tumor because the tumor changes (evolves) so much in terms of protecting itself. See the picture. An immune cell approaches a tumor and often has no way to get inside. Major obstacles 1. Acidic tumor microenvironment 2. hypoxia (low oxygen) inside tumor 3. low nutrition there 4. fibroblasts form tight shields 5. A lot of immune suppressors like myeloid derived suppressor cells, regulatory T cells, checkpoint expression, immune suppressive cytokines. Other unknown things. That's why blood cancers are easier to treat than solid cancers. They are easier to penetrate. It is easier to kill cancer when it's microscopic and if natural ways could not do it then they can't do it after cancer grows and evolves.",

Cb1 receptors are located mostly in the brain, CB2 receptors are located mostly on all types immune cells. The plant cannabinoids are used on top of our endocannabinoids. Marijuana has 2 major components, THC and CBD. THC binds to both CB1 and CB2 receptors. It causes immunosupressive effects by 4 different mechanisms. Apoptosis of immune cells, inhibition of cytokine and chemokine production, inhibition of T cell proliferation and increase in pro-cancer regulatory T cells (Tregs). \"Cannabinoid-induced apoptosis in immune cells as a pathway to immunosuppression\" https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3005548/ CBD exerts it's immunosupressive effects in activated memory TMOG cells via (a) suppressing proinflammatory Th17-related transcription, (b) by promoting T cell exhaustion/tolerance, (c) inhibiting IFN-dependent T cell proliferation, (d) hampering antigen presentation, and (e) inducing antioxidant milieu resolving inflammation. https://jneuroinflammation.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s1... From another paper: \"CBD also suppressed IL-2 and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) mRNA expression, proliferation, and cell surface expression of the IL-2 receptor alpha chain, CD25. While all of these observations support the fact that CBD suppresses T cell function, we now demonstrate that CBD suppressed IL-2 and IFN-γ production in purified splenic T cells. CBD also suppressed activator protein-1 (AP-1) and nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) transcriptional activity, which are critical regulators of IL-2 and IFN-γ. Furthermore, CBD suppressed the T cell-dependent anti-sheep red blood cell immunoglobulin M antibody forming cell (anti-sRBC IgM AFC) response. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2748879/ All these effects are anti-inflammatory and beneficial for the treatment of autoimmune diseases and organ transplant maintenance. The usage of cannabinoids for cancer is being studied. Some cancers express CB2 receptors and can undergo apoptosis similar to immune cells. The doses and scheduling should be determined in clinical trials for selected patients expressing CB2 on cancer cells. However, cannabinoids is not beneficial for patients undergoing cancer immunotherapy. The response rate to cancer immunotherapy decreased 2 fold with the concurrent use of cannabis.

LAG-3 TIM-3 (was discovered about 10 years ago). TIGIT is a newly discovered immune receptor on some percentage of T cells and Natural Killer Cells(NK). BTLA (displays T-Cell inhibition via interaction with tumor necrosis family receptors (TNF-R) and B7 family of cell surface receptors). The inhibitors of these checkpoints are used also in combinations and with other immunotherapies in many clinical trials. See the table below (cut in 3 pieces)",

      "Content": "There are many mechanisms of drug resistance that have been uncovered in the last decades. They include genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptional factors. Years ago I worked on a project of developing a drug for hepatitis C virus, HCV, (in collaboration with many other groups). We would spend a couple of months improving our drugs based on protein structure of the viral RNA-polymerase, but the virus needed usually one week to become drug-insensitive. The viral genome sequencing revealed multiple mutations in the resistant virus. A similar situation happened with other drugs for many chronic viral diseases such as HIV. To control viral replication combination drugs were needed to inhibit almost all viral functions simultaneously. Still, some small numbers of the virus would persist. There is also drug resistance of bacterial infections to antibiotics (known for a long time). Cancer cells behave like other unicellular organisms. They compete for space and nutrients, they obey the laws of Darwinian evolution according to which the fittest cells survive, the unfit cells die off. The tumors are very heterogeneous. they consist of multiple subclones. Even though all cancer cells are descended from the same cell of origin by clonal expansion, new random mutations were added to some cells during frequent cell divisions. These cells formed their own subclones and the resulting tumor is a mixture of many subclones with different added mutations and different sensitivity to drugs. Cancer can be cured at early stages when it is localized. Once it spreads through the body it's more difficult to kill each cancer cell till the last one. But the tumor is heterogeneous not only genetically (due to different mutations in subclones), but even in the same subclone the expression of different markers is different. There are individual cells with high expression of resistance markers. When a drug penetrates the tumor environment it kills chemosensitive cells, but insensitive cells survive and repopulate the tumor. As a result, it becomes drug resistant. Any cytotoxic drug that kills cancer cells causes drug resistance to this particular drug. Other drugs are needed to kill those cells resistant to previous therapy. Other causes of drug resistance include cancer stem cells, dormant cells and EMTcells. There are some common traits between these types of cells. They are more resistant to treatments than regular cancer cells. \"Treatment-Induced Mutagenesis and Selective Pressures Sculpt Cancer Evolution.\" https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5538404/ \"Rare cell variability and drug-induced reprogramming as a mode of cancer drug resistance\" https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5542814/ Interestingly, another proposed strategy to treat cancer is to avoid complete elimination of drug-sensitive cell population in order to prevent proliferation of drug-resistant subclones. \"Exploiting evolutionary principles to prolong tumor control in preclinical models of breast cancer\" https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4962860/.

      "Content": "The worst manifestation of drug resistance could happen in immunotherapy. It's called hyperprogression. Hyperprogression was discovered a couple of years ago when checkpoint inhibitors were used more routinely. The mutations that caused hyperprogression were mostly in 2 areas: in antigen display machinery and in oncogenic signaling pathways. For immunotherapy to work he cancer antigens should be displayed on the surface of cancer cells by MHC complexes. MHCs are the antigen displaying machinery. If cancer antigens are not displayed the cytotoxic T cells don't see cancer cells and don't kill them. At the same time the oncogenic pathways can accelerate by mutations/amplifications. As a result, the tumor growth rate exceeds that of the most aggressive cancers. In this case chemotherapy is the most useful response to hyperprogression.",

But if you target several receptors at once cancer cannot mutate all of them simultaneously. So it's multi targeted poison. Targets will be personalized depending on patients tumors. But for now they did the research only in mice.

Patients will begin to receive the new treatment next year, and the team now wants to establish \u2018immune banks\u2019 to store disease-fighting cells.\" Another new approach was developed for glioma. Patients receive vaccine that is made from autologous tumors mixed with processed similar tumors from strangers. The simultaneous use of tolerance-breaking immunostimulatory allogeneic (from other patients) tissue-derived antigens stimulates immune pathways against tumor associated antigens of the patient\u2019s tumor. I see such approach for the first time (usage of tumors from other patients together with autologous tumors. Gliovac was injected into the skin, and given with Leukine (GM-CSF) and low-dose Cytoxan (cyclophosphamide), a chemotherapy. The results showed that Gliovac was safe and potentially effective in treatment-resistant GBM patients, enhancing the overall survival in all nine patients. Based on these results, the FDA approved a Phase 2, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial (NCT01903330) in recurrent GBM patients. This trial will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Gliovac in combination with Leukine and Cytoxan, plus the cancer medicine Avastin (bevacizumab). The trial is currently enrolling up to 84 patients at one site in California. https://immuno-oncologynews.com/erc1671/ So, the new cancer breakthroughs are in the air.
