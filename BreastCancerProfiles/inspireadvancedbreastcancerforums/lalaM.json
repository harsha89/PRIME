      "Content": "I was diagnosed with Estrogen plus grade 3 breast cancer in June 18th/2017. Had lumpectomy and chemotherapy. Two weeks later found another lump. after that had mastectomy. One week after my surgery found another lump. So my surgeon had to remove major and minor pectoralis muscles. One month later started radiation, I had 22 sessions. In November 26th/2018 had oophorectomy. Now, I just got my CT scan results. My oncologist thinks that I have a secondary breast cancer in my lungs. She said life expectancy 5 years. I just want to know if anyone has a secondary bc in lungs . What was ur treatment? Was it effective? Lala Edited April 6, 2019 at 10:44 pm",
