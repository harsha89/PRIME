    "Content": "The pain and indignity of cancer are lifted, and for that, we can be thankful. The death of a loved one weighs heavy, and for that, we can look towards peace. How splendid May lives on - in your heart, in your children and grandchildren, and in the art she created. Pray that you are surrounded by friends and family as you mourn May and that you find memories of her bring joy to your days. Her obituary, as well as your writing here, paint a beautiful portrait of a loving, accomplished woman. https://www.saulsfh.com/notices/MabelMay-Reisz Edited May 30, 2019 at 12:23 pm",
