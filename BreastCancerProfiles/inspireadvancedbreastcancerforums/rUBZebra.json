Do you think she is at risk of falling? Perhaps she might benefit from using an assisted device, cane or walker, even maybe a wheelchair. Can you get her physician to order a physical therapy assessment and possibly an Occupational Therapy assessment. She may greatly benefit from learning some energy saving techniques and benefit from assistive devices and gentle therapeutic exercises to improve her ability to function in daily activities including leisure actives. If fatigue is an issue, she will benefit from learning energy saving techniques. The therapists will work with you as well to educate you on how you can best help your mom to have best quality of life and be most comfortable. Check it out. Feel free to ask me any questions if you think I can help. Best of luck.",
