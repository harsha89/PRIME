      "Content": "My wife Kitty, who started this journey as a triple positive (as of a 2015 recurrence after 20 years of remission), is now TN-MBC Stage IV / PD-L1 Negative based on a March 2019 biopsy and April genetic tests by Tempus. Pulled her off Ibrance / Faslodex and put her on Xeloda (4000 mgs daily) because there are no alternatives for her at this point. She has developed mets throughout her spine, pelvis and ribs.",

      "Content": "Jeanette: Sorry to hear about your situation. My wife, Kitty, has a 20-plus-year history with MBC that I won't repeat for the millionth time on the blog. Suffice to say for purposes of your post that she has been on Ibrance / Faslodex since Sept 2016. A PETscan last week showed a breakout...cancer on every vertebrae, ribs, pelvis and some nodes after more than a year of NED except for spots of some of her vertebrae. She will undergo a core biopsy of the nodes asap to test for receptors and genetics of the cancer. Her onc guessed today that he will be moving her to Afinitor & Aromasin.",
