      "Content": "Tomorrow (04/25/19) I am going for the removal of the lobular breast cancer on the right along with some lymph nodes and the papaloma they found on the left. I met with a thoracic surgeon today concerning the lung cancer. He wants a lung function test, an EBUS (to get a biopsy of trachea tissue) and an MRI of the brain to check for mets. He said once he has these, he can form a plan of attack. He has mentioned surgery, radiation and possibly chemo or immunotherapy. I asked if he had a stage yet. He said 2A or 2B (the tumor is in the left lower lung and there are some lymph nodes on the left side of the lung that are involved) . I asked the prognosis. He said 50-60% have a 5 year survival rate. Tough news! Still keeping a positive attitude though! I am still feeling fine. No symptoms of lung cancer and, other than feeling the lump, no signs of breast cancer. I read a cancer forum room that was more humor oriented that people were naming their cancers. So, Molly is my Lobular Cancer, Polly is the Papaloma and Felicia is the Lung Cancer. (This is so when it is gone, we can say Bye Felicia!) So, tomorrow I say good bye to Molly and Polly! I hope I never see you again!",

      "Content": "Molly and Polly are gone. The breast cancer surgery was a success! When the biopsy on the Lobular breast cancer came back, it was HER2-. After the surgery the tumor was sent away for testing. It came back as Equivocal. This means they aren't sure. They had to send the specimen off to California for a FISH test. This would be definitive. About a week later, it came back as HER2-! Yay! I was prescribed Norco (Vicodin) for pain after the surgery. I did not need to take any., They gave me exercises to do to help with range of motion. (Walking fingers up the wall and making circular motions with my arms by my sides.) I didn't do these because I was not having any trouble with motion. My surgery was on a Thursday. Saturday I was driven 2 hours to and 2 hours from my daughter's college graduation. It was not too bad. I was expecting the recovery to be a lot worse than it was. Maybe it was the places of the incisions??? I do actually have a pretty high pain tolerance. No chemo needed. Recommended 6 weeks of radiation. July I am supposed to start Arimidex, an anti-cancer hormone therapy. Tomorrow I meet with the radiation oncologist right before the thoracic surgeon. The Adenosquamous Lung Cancer: I had the lung function test. This was basically breathing into a tube with and without resistance with a clip to close my nose. No meds or IV's needed! They said my lung function was very good! Yay! I had the brain MRI with and without contrast. This is not for the claustrophobic! They do give you headphones and you can chose a genre of music to listen to. I just kept my eyes closed. For the contrast, I did have to get an IV to administer the contrast. Tests came back ... there is a brain, but no visible lesions! Yay! The last test I had was the EBUS (brochoscopy). This was treated as a surgery. I was put to sleep. They went in through my mouth and took 5 or 6 specimens checking for cancer. They were checking the trachea and lymph nodes near the trachea for cancer. I was able to eat soft foods later that day. I had a bit of a cough for a day or 2. I just used throat lozenges to help with a sore throat. It wasn't horrible. Just like a strep throat feeling. I just got the results back ... no cancer found in any of the samples they took! Yay! I go to the thoracic surgeon tomorrow to find out the plan of attack for the lung cancer (Felicia!).",
