    "Content": "I regret to inform you that my wife, May, died yesterday, May 23, 2019. She was \"New Challenges,\" She had Stage 4 Metastasized Lobular Breast Cancer. It was diagnosed in 2013. However,as you know, it does not show up on mamograms which she had regularly had. In 2013, near where we live in SC,she was playing in the waves at Hilton Head island with our grandchildren. She got hit by a big wave and it slightly fractured her back. In treating her for that injury, they found the presence of cancer calls and subsequently identified it as breast cancer, left breast, at that point through out her bones. Recently, 2018-2019, in December on a PET scan (I think) they discovered the presence of cancer spots on her liver. The first soft tissue cancer. She really started getting worse. By April, 2019, she could not stand on her own with out help, and then was bed-ridden. In the final weeks she was not able to communicate with us. I recalled Dylan Thomas' poetical lines, \"Do no go gently into that good night.Rage rage against the dying of the light\" I was holding her hand as she died. She was seemingly unconscious but she fought for every last breath! She was an artist, painter, with her work in many corporate and private collections. She had had a number of one woman shows. Losing an artist is a serious thing! as is my losing a wife, mother, grandmother, companion. The INSPIRE Community was extremely important to her! Peace...Fred( Reisz)",
