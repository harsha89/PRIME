    "Content": "My wife was on Kadcyla for 28 months and I can report was just great!. She has been on Xeloda also and suffered H&F syndrome, took a break and is now back on it on a Trial (Syd985.002). We have lots of different creams so fingers crossed. Good luck on Kadcyla and have no fears God bless x",
