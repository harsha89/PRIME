      "Content": "Hi May 607 I landed up with necrosis of the jaw when I had been on zometa for about 9/10 years. I used to have infusions once a month for a couple of years then reduced to every three months. I had to have the jaw scraped by a maxillofacial surgeon and still bits of bones appeared. Finally, when one big piece of bone appeared he pulled it out. Touch wood, all has been OK since then which was about 5 years ago. Both the onco and surgeon said to stay off the zometa which I have to date. ONJ is really painful and I feel desperately sorry that you are going through this. Holding thumbs that your jaw is sorted soon. Speak to your onco and dentist/surgeon about going back onto zometa. A lot of info on this site about ONJ. Good luck and let me know how you are getting on. Take care Sue",

      "Content": "Hi all Everyone who has/had ONJ has my deepest sympathy. I was told by both onco and maxillofacial surgeon to stay off Zometa and other such drugs. Must admit, I am too scared to go back on them as ONJ pain is unbearable. Good luck May, with whatever route you eventually decided on. Take care Sue",
