    "Content": "I was on dexamethasone for about a month and started at 4 mg for inflammation. The first day I took it I felt great but sleep was challenging. It seems that 10 mg is kind of high I would ask for it to be reduced to half that. It has a really long half life and it takes about two weeks to get completely out of your system. After I got off I had very uncomfortable with drawl symptoms of bodyaches headaches my skin broke out . The medicine is a blessing and a curse and I recommend using it as little as possible. The letters all is the reason why I had to use it it\u2019s been two years now and my hands and feet and back and neck I just ache all the time and at night my hands and feet swell up and hurt in the morning. But the dexamethasone made it all go away and it was great for a while but the lack of sleep and the worry of side effects were enough to make me wean off . I\u2019m going to be experimenting with taking 2 mg once a month to see if that keeps the inflammation down to a more comfortable level without having the bad side effects. I seemed good on the 2 mg to control the pain and the sleep problems seem to kind of settle down a little bit. But I have to admit I was really hyper the first few days on the dexamethasone. But after I reduced it down to 2 mg and then down to one the fatigue started to come back so you just have to find the right dose for yourself . But to anyone considering taking the dexamethasone please use it as little as possible the side effects can be pretty bad if you take it for too long and it takes a long time for her to get out of your system",
