      "Content": "Hi all! I just started halaven last tues. I will go again for dose two or my round one this tues. For me, I felt great the day of infusion. I did get premeds for nausea and haven\u2019t needed anything since. Day two I was ok and day three a bit blah. Day four my back hurt pretty bad. Day five still about the same with back. Feet burned bad a couple of nights and I didn\u2019t sleep much at all. Today is day six and feeling better. I have been taking l-glutamine powder in water, blight on amazon and b6 for the neuropathy. I just started it when I started halaven. I missed a day of glutamine and my feet burned horrible. So I do feel it helps. Your supposed to do two glasses a day but I don\u2019t find it tastes so great so I\u2019m trying to make sure I get one done a day. I\u2019d say I\u2019m a mix of constipated to a bit loose. I did miralax first day of treatment but that was all. My hair, I lost it with abraxane, which didn\u2019t work for me. Then went for 7 rounds of ac/red devil chemo so it didn\u2019t grow back. I had two weeks off between ac and halaven so have a good fuzz going. Should be interesting to see what happens! I\u2019m three years stage 4, de novo and er+ pr- her2-. I started bone only and it went to my liver after 18 months of lbrance femara. My liver is the issue now, pretty full of larger mets that nothing seems to kill! There are not a lot on this chemo I found out as well from the boards. Will keep posting and let you know how next dose is. I have read the first few rounds are the hardest and it gets better. Side effect of course do seem to build up over the long haul. Most say this chemo is pretty do-able. Sarah",

      "Content": "txgirl, how long did you make it on halaven? so last week I went for dose two of round one but white counts were too low to get it. I went this tues and they again drew blood and my white counts went down a little more, again. the doctor said not a big deal I just went through 7 rounds of ac chemo so it is hard to rebound. the red counts did go up decent though. next tues, should my whites go back up, ill get full dose halaven and then the next day a neulesta shot. hope to get both doses in for my round two!! I really never did get tired and didn't get nausea. I did get horrible back pain and some joint pain. ill keep you posted.",

      "Content": "Lleleaux- were your counts in the normal range even after having two weeks off ibrance? I was off ac chemo for two weeks before I started halaven. My counts were up but not near normal range. My doctor says with suppressed numbers already it isn\u2019t shocking they went this low. I stopped abraxane and then went right into ac chemo and it took it all out of me. Both red and white counts went so low, had a fever, went in hospital for a week. It took me a week to get the hell out of there. I had blood transfusions, platelets, potassium. I finally got neulesta shots at the end of the week or I\u2019d probably still be in the hospital, lol! That was the end of oct. It takes so long for the counts to come up and then you hit them again with harder chemo and it wipes you right back out. I read the first round is the hardest. It prob is bc they said the same thing with ac. It was two rounds and I was a little better. You can try a lower dose or every other week too. You still have options. I\u2019ll let you know next week tues what happens. Sarah",
