      "Content": "I have been on Taxol for a few months. It was working great at the start and then suddenly markers went up and yesterday's PET secured the fact that I have to get off it. Verzenio next. Hair loss, yes, but fuzz has grown back with the lower dose. No brows or lashes. Also the nails on both big toes had to be removed as they were pulling away from the skin. Bad skin reactions on arms and thighs (which is why dose was lowered) and moderate neuropathy in feet in spite of the icing of the hands and feet during infusion. But I am an actress and I was able to do my complete week of shows for months while on it. Fatigue for me was moderate. I have a port and that did make it easier. The hardest thing for me was the Benadryl given before the chemo infusion. Knocked me out. Needed to crawl into bed for a few hours after. But in spite of it would have stayed on Taxol if it continued to work.",
