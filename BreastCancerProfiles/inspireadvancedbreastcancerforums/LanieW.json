    "Content": "Hi I was originally diagnosed with BC in 1994 - yes, that long ago. Had a mastectomy and all good until 2011 when a tumour was discovered in my rotters node. Radiotherapy and tamoxifen took care of that but there was a suspicion that it was in my lungs (just miniscule dots at this point). Unfortunately it was correct but I have been on all the hormone tablets, just finished a round of chemotherapy and started faslodex. Apart from tiredness, still living a normal life. Don't believe your Dr Doom - even though my tumours are now apparent I hopefully have many years left and at 75 that makes me happy. I just think of it as a chronic illness that is being treated and that i'm lucky to be living a good life. Hugs and good luck",
