    "Content": "Hi, I am on one of the DS-8201A trials - i am HER2 Low and I have a HEr2 activating mutation. I started the drug in late February and I have been an objective responder - meaning my cancer has been shrinking. The drug is very tolerable - I am working nearly full time, I have young kids, and I am living a full life. I have met many other patients on DS-8201A and everyone I know is doing well. It appears to have lasting impact - e.g. folks tend to stay on the drug a fairly long time. for the phase 1 with HER2 Low, the medial was 12.9 months to progression. In cancerland, that is great. My side effects have been nauseau (managed with drugs), diarrhea (managed with Imodium) and occasional fatigue (managed with naps). I am crossing my fingers that I stay on the drug a very, very long time. Good luck to your daughter.",
