      "Content": "Brian your bosses are barking up the gene therapy tree since these modified genes can be patented and therefore profits sky high. Our group(and many others) already has a proven and effective treatment but the FDA will not push it through nor will trials be funded(USA) due to lack of profits. The Europeans however are moving along very well. We don't need Joe Biden's moon shot, since everyone knows clinical research is guarded by intellectual property rights and can't be shared. It's every clinic for themselves since to show your cards defeats the chase for profits, and stops the game. I don't know if theres a kitty hat for cancer site monitors but do a Google you might find one. It's a shame to see so many people passing away that can't make it to Europe, but such is life. Scientist say 2 to 300 new cancer drugs must be approved a year for gene mapping to be effective, that's a ten fold increase from today. ..... just saying",

      "Content": "I don't see any direct applications of your cut and paste info for PNET. Could you explain what your goals are here at the PNET site? And why you are doing these global posts? We have specific experts on this site but you're clearly not one of them. So what are you trying to achieve? If there is a overall cure for cancer we will see it on the nightly news. As a matter of fact Alpha radiation has been on the 6pm news....we just need to get FDA approval here.",
