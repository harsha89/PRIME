      "Content": "I had headaches initially, and we determined it was caused by long acting anti nausea drug given to me at infusion called Aloxi. Main side effect is headaches & stays in your system for 72+ hours. I switched to one Zofran tab, taken at infusion, that lasts 8 hours. If I continued to be nauseated, I could have taken another tab or two, but haven\u2019t had to. I had a slight headache the next day, controllable with Advil. I also do acupuncture weekly for migraine headaches and to keep the neuropathy I got from taxol at bay. Honestly, the nausea will get much better as your daughter adjusts to the drug. Mine did. Hope she does well on it. I dm getting my 14th cycle today. Lori",

      "Content": "I know you asked Lisa these questions, but I can also weigh in. Firstly, what dose is your daughter on? Phase 2 has 3 dosage levels, and if she is on the really high dose, she is getting pummeled. Doc might consider a dose reduction. FYI, Phase 3 will go forward with 5.4. My onc used IV aloxi first, but I had bad headaches (se of many anti-nausea meds). We tried Zofran, both IV and pill form - headache again. Now I use old fashioned compazine. Her body should adjust to the drug, and se will diminish somewhat. I would also expect continual response on scans. That seems to be the pattern of results at MSKCC. From experience, it\u2019s very easy to be depressed when you physically feel awful. I hope things improve.",

      "Content": "I don\u2019t mean to be a Debbie Downer, but if you are on DS8201-a, you will lose some hair, in spite of it being a targeted therapy. To be in a clinical trial, you have to sign a document, that lists all the side effects and all the additional tests, bloodwork, etc, that you can expect to have. If you are on Phase 2 of this trial, look at this document and under side effects you should see partial or complete alopecia. I have been on this trial for 40 weeks and met 3 other trial participants. They have all lost some degree of hair. It does come back. Mine is coming back, but not with the same texture and body as my original hair.",

      "Content": "My scans have been really good.I have never been on a drug this long. Best results I\u2019ve had have been 8 mos. Acupuncture does help for nausea and headaches, but please be certain your daughter is seeing a certified, licensed acupuncturist. In some states, therapists can just take one course to call themselves an acupuncturist. I am in Phase 2 of this trial at Memorial Sloan Kettering in NYC. I live in Virginia and travel every 3 weeks to participate and be treated. I fought hard to get into this trial and consider myself both lucky and smart for being here. Is your daughter\u2019s cancer high or low expressing her2? Do you know what dose she is on?",

      "Content": "If she is low expressing, there are 4 levels of dosing, ranging from 5.4 to 8.4, I believe. I will tell you for high expressing her2 patients, the FDA approved dose for Phase 3 (and probably beyond) is 5.4. I am on 6.4 and just asked for a dose reduction, which the onc said was reasonable and I would get in my next cycle. The higher the dose, the more the toxicity and intensity of se. Find out what dosage she is on. If it\u2019s the really high one, it\u2019s reasonable to ask for a dose reduction, especially w all the info they have on the drug. She has to live her life.",
