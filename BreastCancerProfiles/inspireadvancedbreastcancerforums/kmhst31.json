    "Content": "My Wife started taking Halaven in December 2015 after her liver mets progressed on Xeloda. Within Days of her first dose, she became incoherent and upon arrival at the ER her BP was 59/35 and she was suffering from acute kidney failure. she took her second dose about three weeks later, followed by another hospital stay as her Ammonia levels were spiking. She was a complete mess until about mid march 2016 and could barely walk until September 2016. All of her hair fell out, including her eyelashes and eyebrows, and she lost a lot of weight. It did shrink her tumors by about half by March, 2016, and it kept her stable until March 2017. Her Oncologist said that the symptoms were a result of the disease and not the Drug, but she started improving after the Oncologist lowered the dose and changed the frequency to every 2 weeks instead of 3 out of 4 weeks. she had progression in March 2016, at which time she switched to Gemzar and changed oncologists.",
