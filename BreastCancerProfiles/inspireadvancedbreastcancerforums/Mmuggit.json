    "Content": "File a complaint with the hospital, anesthesiologist and surgeon. File a claim. I\u2019m so sorry this happened. They messed up, badly. Call the Patient Advocate at the hospital immediately, at minimum. Ask them to have the hospital board review your case. If I were you, I\u2019d just go straight to an attorney and have them manage the case. You don\u2019t need the extra stress. They forgot to anesthetize you. I had numbing agent and twilight. I felt my catheter poking my heart and spoke up. I still had no PAIN, just a sensation. They knocked me out again dropped the head of the table and pulled it back a bit. Then looked at the position on X-ray. This surgeon messed up it sounds like. Blessings. ðŸ’—",
