    "Content": "I was on Halaven for a short period of time. I had salt and pepper hair and only the black part fell out. What was left was this weird color and texture. I went to a hair thinning specialist, she cut and colored my hair and had me use products called Revive3. This helped with the texture and fullness. I also had weakness/neuropathy in my arms. But it resolved after I moved on to another drug. I wish you the best. Diana",
