      "Content": "The faslodex injections are paid by Medicare Part A and the remainder, at least for me, through my supplementary health insurance. The Ibrance is covered under Medicare Rx plans, but the initial deductible is very high, and subsequent refills have a large co-pay. There are foundations that will help and for Medicare patients, there is a Pfizer Patient Assistance Program that will pay the cost totally if you qualify financially. I received the initial information for this from my hospital's specialty pharmacy. You can also go on the Pfizer website for assistance and see what they offer. I hope this helps.",

      "Content": "Thank you Squire BC. I\u2019ve exhausted all the AI treatments: tamoxifen, an Astrozole, Exemestane, and Faslodex/Ibrance. Now that I Mets to lungs, bones & liver (new), my ONC says I must go the chemo route. I don\u2019t qualify for the immunotherapy b/c I have a history of neumonitis which I got on a clinical trial with Entinostat. I\u2019m glad you did well on the Xeloda. I\u2019m starting to lean towards that, but I\u2019m afraid of GI problems. A week ago, I went through 10 sessions of radiation to Pelvic structures and both femurs. It has left me with horrible GI problems, both diarrhea & constipation, not to mention fatigue. I had radiation to my chest for 2 1/2 months 6 years ago. It was bad, but not as terrible as what I\u2019m experiencing now. Good news - the bone pain I was experiencing is gone. I must wait another few weeks to start on Xeloda. Of course this current GI situation worries me and I\u2019m afraid of this being my new normal. If you don\u2019t mind, would you please share information on your Xeloda experience. What was your dosage? How many pills did you take in the AM & PM. What side effects did you have & how did you manage them? I am desperate to get back to my water exercise, walking and yoga routines. Do you think I can do it on Xeloda. I thank you so much and the other people on this forum that have been so helpful. You are all comforting.",

      "Content": "It's so understandable to go through a period of sadness & even fear when there is progression. I started Ibrance/Faslodex on July 2017, when my MBC progressed from lungs to bones. I saw a clinical SW a few times to help me accept this new chapter. I had fatigue for the first few months. I had to accept it & take a nap. I am 70 years old, but have always been athletic. Within months, I resumed my activity at the gym every day & renewed energy. I get tired at times, but no fatigue. However, the muscle/bone pain has increased, so I had to modify the intensity & frequency of my activity. I am retired, so I do volunteer work & keeping busy. My hair has thinned out, which bugs me, but I keep it short & fluff it up. The fact that you're working is so helpful in keeping your mind alert & away from focusing on your cancer and even any possible side effects. My first bout of BC was in 1995 and I am so impressed and hopeful by the continued advances in treatments. I have met many women who have been on this combo for way longer periods and continue to be stable. Many of them work outside the home. I wish you the best on this new treatment.",

      "Content": "If you have commercial insurance (e.g., from employer) you can get assistance from Pfizer. I think at $10 copay or something like that. If you are on medicare & additional Rx insurance, then you might try the Pfizer Financial Assistance Program for Ibrance. I\u2019ve received Ibrance free for 2018 & 2019. I was initially rejected for both years, but wrote a hardship letter & was approved. You must fill out forms (on Pfizer website) and have your doctor fill out their part & send directly to Pfizer. I was also concerned about the high co-pay, but my hospital\u2019s specialty pharmacy initially helped with this. I hope that this helps.",

      "Content": "Ibrance/Faslodex stopped working for me this month. My doctor recommended Taxol or Xeloda. I am leaning towards weekly Taxol. Before I decide, I want to know from you wonderful ladies what life is like on Taxol. While on I/F, I was doing water exercise and yoga 3x a week, as well as walking about 50 minutes daily. How possible is that on taxol. I will need a port. Do you think I can swim & do water exercise? Also, is hair loss always a side effect? Thanks for your help.",
