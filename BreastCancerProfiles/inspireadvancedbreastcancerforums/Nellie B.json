      "Content": "My experience is not that great. I waited after mild progression and was simply switched from Ibrance and letrozole to Ibrance and Faslodex. Suddenly the viscous cells went to my liver and many other places. If you\u2019re going to stay on the same regimen pls pls stay on top of things with weekly marker checks. My liver progression was not caught by regular scans but by the PET CT. I hope that things will be much better for you. Ibrance and Verzinio give great quality of life.",

      "Content": "Sorry that she has to go through this terrible disease.... just like me :( Most probably her oncologist will give her some chemo regimen to make sure that the cancer cells are stopped from progressing. Then he might try immunotherapy which has shown lots of promise for TNBC patients. She will need the support of all of you around her. Wishing her all the best.",
