    "Content": "I\u2019m so sorry to hear of your friends passing especially when there are lack of answers. When I was first diagnosed my first 2 appointments I told my husband and my oncologist I don\u2019t know why we are doing anything. It came back within the first 3 years so the end result is the end result. My oncologist was very worried especially because I have kids still in HS but over the next 6 months I did what she told me to do crying and feeling sorry for myself every step of the way. Now luckily I\u2019m 30 months out with no progression and some resolution. It seemed like something in my head clicked and said enough get on with your life. So I agree at one point we, not all of us, just decide to fight it and see what happens. Hugs to you!!",
