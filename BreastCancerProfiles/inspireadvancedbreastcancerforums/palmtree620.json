    "Content": "I have been asked several times by the same people who already asked me when I will be finished with my treatments. Either they were\u2019nt listening the first time or have a memory problem. Another person said to me recently when I was talking to someone about my illness, \u201cWow, you sound so calm\u201d. Some people just do not Know what to say. However, professionals who work in oncology and that includes technicians who do the scans should know better. I had a doctor when I was originally diagnosed with stage 4 shake her head in front of me which made me feel hopeless. No bedside manner. The people on this board are very supportive and have a wealth of information. I have learned a lot from them and try to give back by providing information about the things I have been through.
