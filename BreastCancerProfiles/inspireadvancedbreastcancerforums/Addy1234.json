      "Content": "Fighterm, Glad to hear from you again. Your posts are always an educational experience for my non-scientific mind. That last paragraph was a real head-scratcher for me -- retaining some of the current cancer cell population in order to prevent cells from forming new mutations. Thank you for sharing these articles. I'll be re-reading the articles slowly. Best Wishes, Addy",

The pain and side effects from treatment is bad enough, not to mention adding insult to injury with the loss of your hair. To me and others of the Inspire community, you are a strong beautiful woman, hair or not. Wishing you a good outcome from chemo and keeping you in my prayers! Addy",
