    "Content": "I've done genetic testing, which comes into play more if you're like me, with metastatic thyroid cancer that is RAI resistant. I've been in a few clinical trials, most of them passive (extra blood drawn) and one that involved a new drug therapy. Those kinds of tests are very specific and less likely to be a danger as the broader workups that may find you have a predisposition toward some disease and (if changes occur in insurance) you're not covered as to a pre-existing condition. Warning, such testing is often not covered by insurance. I had the benefit of a clinical trial paying the bills.",
