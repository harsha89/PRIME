      "Content": "Dear angelical37, I am so sorry to read how you are feeling. I am sure many of us have been in a similar place at different points. It is so disappointing to hear how the hospital advocate let you down when you need their support. Where are you based? Are there any other resources available to you locally? Any cancer charities who might be able to guide you towards a better counselling service? I don't have TNBC but wanted to respond as one survivor to another and let you know I am thinking of you and I absolutely believe you can get through this. Sending gentle hugs to you, saltee xxx",

Like shoofoo has said, please keep reaching out. Everyone here will want to support you and help you through this. Maybe your oncologist could also refer you for some one to one counselling to help get you through this? saltee xx",
