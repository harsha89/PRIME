      "Content": "Hi everyone! I don\u2019t know that I\u2019m in the right place as I do not have a diagnosis of breast cancer. But I just wanted to know what everyone thinks based on your experiences. Long story short, or as short as I can make it, about a year and a half ago, I found an indention on my breast about the size of a 50 cent piece. After seeing my ob/gyn she sent me for an ultrasound and mammo. Those came back clear. I still wasn\u2019t convinced I didn\u2019t have breast cancer so my ob/gyn referred me to a breast oncologist. She looked at the indention and did a breast exam and said it looked fine, and if the tests came back fine, she thought i didn\u2019t have anything to worry about. I went for a few months trying to convince myself that she was right. I just couldn\u2019t feel good about it but just continued to try to go on as though I was fine. I put it to the back of my mind, but last November, I woke up with my chin and lip feeling kind of weird. I would get a zapping feeling in my lip about 20 times a day. After googling, I found out about numb chin syndrome. It scared me so much because the main cause is metastatic breast cancer. My nurse practitioner ordered an MRI of my brain to rule out MS and it was clear. So I went back to the breast oncologist and she ordered another mammogram to be done. It was benign findings and showed benign calcifications. Once again, I put it out of my mind and tried to forget about it. Well, now here I am 6 months later, with a somewhat numb chin, almost like dental anesthesia is wearing off and you just start to get the feeling back, and every time I smile, I get a zapping feeling in my lip. I saw my nurse practitioner and cried my eyes out to her about what was going on and she ordered an MRI of the mandible. I went to get it done and they said they don\u2019t do them of the mandible, so they changed it to a soft tissue neck MRI. It came back clear, even stating that the mandible was unremarkable. You would think I would feel fantastic after hearing that, but I\u2019m so afraid they didn\u2019t do the right test to see cancer and they\u2019ve missed something. I\u2019m terrified. I\u2019m 36 with 2 little girls and I\u2019m so afraid I have breast cancer they never found and I\u2019m gonna leave my two babies motherless. I have an appointment Wednesday with an oral surgeon to see about getting my impacted wisdom tooth cut out, so they\u2019ll be doing panoramic xrays showing my jaw, but what else should I be doing? I also have a neurologist appointment in july but that seems like forever away. Edited May 20, 2019 at 10:39 am",

I\u2019m actually at an oral surgeons office now to set up surgery to get my impacted upper wisdom tooth out. They\u2019re getting ready to do xrays. I\u2019m so scared it\u2019s going to show a tumor. This morning my chin started to tingle. It\u2019s only done that a couple of times and not for this long. I\u2019m praying it\u2019s something simple that the oral surgeon can tell me is causing it.",

      "Content": "Thank you! I had my panorama X-ray at the oral surgeon\u2019s office and he said everything looked normal and that MRI would have picked up any tumors soft tissue or in my mandible. I\u2019m still scared because I still have the tingling in my chin. I could forget about it if it didn\u2019t tingle all the time. I called the neurologist office to see if I could get in sooner and she said they\u2019ve not had any cancellations so I still can\u2019t get in until July. I\u2019m so frustrated because everything I\u2019ve read on numb chin syndrome says it should be handled as emergent because of the grave prognosis. I\u2019m sorry. I know all of you who are battling breast cancer have way bigger things to deal with. I appreciate that you all are taking time out to answer my questions and give me advice.",

I\u2019ve called every day to see if they\u2019ve had any cancellations and no such luck. I\u2019m praying because I just want answers. I have aches and pains all over and every time I worry that it\u2019s cancer that\u2019s spread to my bones. My anxiety is in high gear these days. My primary care doctor started me on Wellbutrin 3 weeks ago but so far it hasn\u2019t helped me. I\u2019m just scared.",

My breast surgeon said that it\u2019s nothing to worry about. I respect her because she\u2019s a great doctor and actually a breast oncologist, so she does see breast cancer every day, but I still have a gut feeling they\u2019ve missed something by not doing an MRI. When I mentioned it she told me that the insurance wouldn\u2019t pay unless I had a palpable lump. I just don\u2019t know what else to do if they won\u2019t order the MRI.",

      "Content": "Thank you, beatez! I\u2019ll definitely look into that. I\u2019ve been doing an anti-inflammatory diet following a guy named Dr. Josh Axe. His mother had breast cancer and it has metastasized and that diet and following her doctor\u2019s advice she is now cancer free. She did do chemo too, but I believe the diet helped a lot. So, I do want to do whatever I can to keep it at bay if this is indeed cancer. My pain is in different spots for the most part but it does tend to show up In the same spots at times. Like in my upper thighs and arms. It\u2019s just unnerving when you think it could really be cancer. I also think maybe I\u2019m hyper-sensitive to the pain because it\u2019s always in the back of my mind, no matter what.",
