      "Content": "I have a right malignant pleural effusion that was found on a November 2018 scan. I was experiencing SOB and coughing as well as fatigue. I was on navelbine which did not work for me after Verzenio also stopped working. I am estrogen + and Her 2 -. They surgically drained my lung but the effusion came back so now I have a tube inserted since December 2018 which I drain every 3-4 days. I get about 200-300 cc every few days. I am now on weekly taxotere with one week off every 3 weeks. My CA153 has come down from 1200 to about 800. I am feeling much better and will be rescanned next month. My oncologist says it is common for metastatic BC to spread to the pleura. I was diagnosed stage 4 in 2010 at diagnosis despite annual mammograms. I have had mets to the bones, skin, adrenal gland, mediastinum, right lung and liver. I am currently 62, non smoker, non drinker and a fitness buff my entire life. Good luck with your pleural effusion. I hope I answered your question.",

      "Content": "Update. I had ct scans showing mixed results. Liver looks better but still draining my right lung every 2 days getting 100-150 cc. Dr. Says it helps to dry up the lung with frequent drainings. I have new bon Mets but no pain. I also have some new skull Mets. We are going to continue weekly taxol and one week off every 3 sessions. We are u are if Taxle is work8ng after 6 months. My CA153 went up from low 700\u2019s after initially dropping from 1200\u2019s. I am now in the 900\u2019s again. I feel fine but get fatigued and SOB easily. I also have developed severe swelling in my feet, ankles and legs. Going for a kidney ct to see kidney function. No clots or fluid seen on recent ultrasound of legs but severe edema. Seeing Lymphedema specialist in 2 weeks. In the mean time using support hose and raising legs as often as possible. Also started gaining weight so they put me on a mild diuretic. Anyone else going through this? I have not had adriamycin yet. No clinical trial available at this time. Any suggestions? How long did Taxol work for you? Did it cause edema for you? Did your pleural effusion ever heal?",
