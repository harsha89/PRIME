    "Content": "Hi Jeanette, I\u2019ve been on Ibrance for 48 cycles now, the last 26 cycles paired with Faslodex. My MBC started in my sturnum also, and then spread to my lung. I have been stable for 26 months on Ibrance and Faslodex. The main sides effects for me have been hair thinning, occasional mouth sores and hot flashes. Fatigue hasn\u2019t been overwhelming. I\u2019ve been very happy with this treatment. I strongly hope it works well for you too. My best wishes to you. Chris.",
