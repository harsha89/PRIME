      "Content": "Liver ablation for my case was surgery where they used heat to destroy the met. 4 hour procedure, stayed overnight 1 night at hospital. Yes I\u2019ve had it in my bones since 2013 making me stage 4. Originally diagnosed in 2010 with stage 2 ( had surgery, chemo). Abraxane is IV chemo, before that I was on Navelbine which also is an IV chemo. I\u2019ve exhausted all the Aromatase Inhibitors so thats why I\u2019m on chemo now. If I do end up moving I think I\u2019ll go with the doctors at Albany Med.",
