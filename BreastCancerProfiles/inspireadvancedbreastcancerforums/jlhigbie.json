      "Content": "I too am depressed and fatigued I will feel good for one min then the wave of fatigue comes over me. What I keep telling my self is remember life is a thread. It can be broken in an instant not even cancer. Car accident, shooting, fall, you name it. I remember one instant a mom and 13 yr old daughter were volunteering. The Mom stayed back to talk with a friend and her 13 yr went on to the car. The story goes the Mom looks up only to see her daughter fall. The daughter died from a ruptured aneurysm only 13. When I am down I tell myself it is my choice to happy!!!. It is my responsibility to look on the half full cup side. Live every day to the fullest enjoy a hug, movie, etc. It does help. if those sad days get in the way talk with some one. We are all on the same page",

      "Content": "Wow reading all the blogs tonight. It seems like we all have our issues and troubles. Me-- my spouse is 84 with some health issues. My son a quad with MS and me stage 4. Of all of us in my family I am probably the healthiest but oh the fatigue. We have a home with a good size yard. Tom helps but the major stuff is mine to do. I too have issues with the cancer staff. I truly believe their problem is they have never had cancer themselves. They don't comprehend where we are. We ourselves have seen many deaths from cancer and worry what it means for us. They don't understand when we have a new pain and panic wanting to know if it a change and the big \"C\" has spread. They don't understand how the meds makes us feel and how it affects our lives for us and the family. It just plain sucks. For now it is just take a day at a time. To all of you keep the encouragement coming. The community helps because we know how it feels and can say truthfully I know what you mean and pass a hug. to all of you just hang in there!!!",

      "Content": "I too have lost the motivation I use to have. Fasolodex lowers your estrogen. I am thinking it has something to do with how we feel. At least for me--yes I think I feel the same but not really. When I was using estrogen replacement therapy I felt tons better. I had more energy, more confidence, just all around felt like a human being. Yes I am surviving, but it isn't the same.",

      "Content": "I agree with the MRI I also havent' read you had a biopsy. Unless you look at the cells you really don't know. Seeing a neurologist is a great idea and be evaluated the chin with the nerve that inervates the chin. Would you have a pinched nerve? Still if it were me, I would try to get some one to biopsy the area of indention.",
