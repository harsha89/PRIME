      "Content": "I\u2019ve been on weekly taxol and carboplatin since the first week of February. Three weeks on and one week off. The first 4 treatments really seemed fine. I was a little fatigued but overall was breezing through compared to prior treatment of radiation with cisplatin. Then after 5th treatment I hit a wall. I started getting very tired, taste changes and icky stomach. I think I got a little dehydrated as the next week I boosted my water intake again and didn\u2019t feel as bad. By end of 6th treatment I needed Neulasta for low WBC. Hemoglobin is also lower. It definitely has gotten harder. I have three more treatments to go and I\u2019ll be done 5/21. Taxol causes hair loss. My hair started coming out after second treatment. I buzzed it off as it was patchy. I still have a lot of fuzz like a crew cut. My body hair has gone and eyebrows and lashes are mostly gone. I don\u2019t know how people do the bigger dose every three weeks. I\u2019m glad I\u2019ve done it weekly. It\u2019s a pain to go weekly but I\u2019ve never needed other meds than what they gave in the infusion. No nausea or vomiting. Heartburn has been an issue as time has gone on but maybe it\u2019s the Carboplatin. Taxol can cause neuropathy so I ice my hands and feet during the infusion and take B complex. So far no neuropathy.",
