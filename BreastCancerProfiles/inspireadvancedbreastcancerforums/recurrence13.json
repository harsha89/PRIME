    "Content": "Have read with great interest and deepest of compassion of your despair, WorriedTooMuch. We\u2019re right there with you! I\u2019ve been METS since 2014; 8 lesions treated 2016, and an old one rearing it\u2019s little head again in 2018. These all treated successfully ZAPPED! SRS. Presently, NED. Yay! PETS and MRI within the next two weeks. It\u2019s damned tough to drown those negative thoughts, doubts and brown spots poppin\u2019 up, those wrinkles comin\u2019 on strong ..my buns a lot saggier as well. I am so lucky to have found someone who deeply loves me (second time around), what a guy! Still, having to take occasional chemo meds for prophylactic purposes is no picnic.Those crappy days when you just wish you didn\u2019t have to reach for the Xeloda and didn\u2019t need a daytime nap/rest doesn\u2019t go away anytime too soon either. I always reach for my positive support resources when one of those fears creep up. I\u2019d be lost without my METS support groups. They are a system, a rock upon which we all gain knowledge and acceptance. We all afraid we\u2019ll get those words, no more options. That\u2019s why we\u2019re there for each other.. Without my two biggest outside activities within my community I\u2019d have serious doubt what i\u2019m Still contributing to a healthy society and my love of this country. They are teaching related, one tutoring the other civic tours and education. Spirit Feeding. I\u2019m a real believer the Jon Cabot Zinn Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction system for meditation is vital to a positive outlook fighting this disease. Take it for a spin through uTube. Most cities have someone certified in teaching the syllabus. Pets. Training is a gem of a way to nurture one of the most precious gifts we\u2019ve been given that of human to canine/feline bonding. The distraction of their love is delicious. My music. I love all sorts to listen to but find tranquility and release when I sit down at piano. And I\u2019ve only had the courage lately to haul out the old sheet music for fear my carpal tunnel surgery May have robbed the expected strength. It\u2019s coming, folks, a work in progress, but still there. My 93 year old mother and I always find common ground and our deepest connections when we talk of our practicing and keeping the fingers nimble. And cooking and walking! I love to conjure new recipes and surround myself with fresh seasonal magazines that peek my curiosities and teach me ways of supporting my best health. It\u2019s now seven months out after total knee replacement and while I need lots more healing and continued strength stretch and weight training for endurance and maximum gains, I am free to explore new places for hiking and dog walking fun too. Last but not LEAST I invest time in maintaining my sense of self image. I see this gift of great medical care , also MSKCC NYC, as a sort of launch pad for also addressing my psychological and emotion insecurities. I take time for \u2018those\u2019 appointments too. The Look Good Feel Good program is a perfect program to get your everything in gear to face the unknown fashionably and with pride. Totally aware we all feel rather do do\u2019ish more times than we want to admit, I take time for the wigs, the makeup, perfume ( mostly very faint scents like Ginger by Origins or Grace by Philosophy... like Ivory Soapfresh!!!) so when I get done with my routine I CAN FACE anything. I know this was a big rambling on, but friends, it\u2019s how I cope. It works for me and brings me close to my beloved as well. Thank you for reading thank you for being out there sharing journeys. We will live to know the best discoveries. Believe It. Affectionately, over here across the river in NJ.",
