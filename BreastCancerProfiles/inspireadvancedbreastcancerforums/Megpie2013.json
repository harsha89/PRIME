      "Content": "Beth, I am on Dexamethasone after I was throwing up three days in a row. The highest dosage I was on is 4 mg a day. Most days I only took the 1 mg and only in the morning so that to can sleep at night. I was having trouble fell asleep. My oncologist said that my pd-1 inhibitors is at 90%. So i should have good result at the mri but I am getting more imbalance, more dizziness. I am extremely scared. I have been through so many treatments i need one that could stop the tumor. God l hope opdivo works like it did on Peter.",

      "Content": "I\u2019ve been on dexamethasone on and off the last year. I pretty much take them when I need it, like when I need to go out. For me it\u2019s the balance issue. I feel fine when I am sitting or laying down. When I stand up I tend to get dizzy and lost balance. The most I ever taken is 4 mg a day. A lot of times I took just 1 mg a day. I don\u2019t know of side effects for me other than sleeplessness.",
