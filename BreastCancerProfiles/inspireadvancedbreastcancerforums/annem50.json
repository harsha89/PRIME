      "Content": "I was on Ibrance for 5 months in 2016. I did not stop due to progression, but due to my concern about known and unknown side effects. I try to minimize meds whenever possible. I was on the lowest 75mg dose Ibrance. It took me into NEAD where I remained for over a year. Now tumor markers are rising and cancer is again active. I am oligometastatic in just my sternum. I'm trying Verzenio since it is said to affect WBC less and hoping for the best",
