    "Content": "Hello, Its is totally shite. I had stage 3 breast cancer which thought id kicked into touch only to be told last week that I now have sternum mets. PET scan later today. I too was on Zoladex and exemestane and was put on sertraline to help with the hot flushes. I think this has really helped with my mood. During chemo I was put on metoclopramide to combat the nausea ....this made me feel very low, sobbing all the time (not me at all) after 3 tablets I stopped and requested an alternative which immediately improved my mood. I am in Lincolnshire, where are you?",
