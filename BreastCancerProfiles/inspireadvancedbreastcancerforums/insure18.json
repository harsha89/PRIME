Easier said then done but try to do something that will take your mind off the results, a funny move, a good book a walk. You are feeling good so that\u2019s a good sign. If the results aren\u2019t what you hoped for you will be upset but then there will be a new plan . We are all here to support you!!",

      "Content": "Hi Angelica, I\u2019m sorry this has happened to you. I was diagnosed stage 4 in feb of 2016, I was put on ibrance and letrozole. I had my ovaries out right away to help stop the estrogen. I also started out with a xgeva shot every month but that is now once every 3 months. I have a very normal life and only my husband and myself know of my diagnosis. I\u2019m still on my 1st line of treatment and have had clear scans since 2017. Of course you are upset, you have ever right to feel it but I can reassure you it won\u2019t slways be like this and it\u2019s not a death sentence. Once you talk to your doctor about treatment I think you might be relieved. We are all here for you and I\u2019m sending you a virtual hug ðŸ’•ðŸ’•",

      "Content": "There was a new nurse at my oncologist office who not only did a number on my arm taking blood but also mentioned she had been \u201cin my seat\u201d 20 years ago. What? I\u2019m sorry a 20 year \u201csurvivor\u201d can not know what it\u2019s like to be stage 4. I thought did she even look at my file??? I just sat quietly, I wasn\u2019t even going to bother saying anything about it. This is exactly why only my husband and I know my diagnosis, I just can\u2019t deal with people. It reminds me of when my first son was stillborn when I was 7 months pregnant, one person said to me \u201c you know, he may have ended up being a criminal\u201d as if this would somehow comfort me?????? 30 years later and I have never forgotten that comment!!",

      "Content": "I understand your fear! My markers have never been high, when I was first diagnosed 3 years ago my marker was 29, now it is 23. So while the markers aren\u2019t too much of a concern, every ache and pain makes me nervous. A headache, is it just a headache or Brain Mets??? Hip pain, are the bone Mets back??? Even when nothing is \u201cwrong\u2019 it feels like we are waiting for the other shoe to drop. Sometimes I can go days and forget I even am stage 4 and then sometimes I can\u2019t even sleep. That\u2019s why after 3 years I\u2019m going to retire, I want to just concentrate on my life and the things that matter to me.",
