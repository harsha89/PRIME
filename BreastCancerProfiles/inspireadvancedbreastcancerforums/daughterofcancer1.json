    "Content": "I am 25 years old, my mom was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer, with months left to live. She\u2019s slowly losing her ability to mobilize. There are so many things I still want to do with her but I\u2019m at a loss with how to plan activities or outings with her as her pain is a constant battle. Do any other caregivers out there have some creative solutions? I want to make the most out of our time together. Thanks.",
