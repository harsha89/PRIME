    "Content": "I\u2019m thankful for options such as Ibrance. When we run out of options, life takes a drastic turn. So, I\u2019m thankful that research continues and they keep coming out with new drugs. I\u2019ve been on Ibrance/Exemestane for just about two months. My tumor markers went down the beginning of January (76.8) and now last week they are up again (114.1). The doctor is not too concerned but I\u2019m worried that if it doesn\u2019t change, we\u2019ll have to go to something else. I hate using up \u201cmy cards\u201d. I too have shortness of breath and extreme fatigue. But, I\u2019ll take it as long as I can keep going. I just adjust my expectations. As far as the Ibrance commercials go, that\u2019s the nice thing about a mute button, or just changing the channel. I ignore the ads.",
