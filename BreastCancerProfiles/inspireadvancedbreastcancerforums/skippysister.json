      "Content": "My onc put me on Percocet and compazine which helped a little but not lasting relief. My tumor marker numbers were much better with the Al's but are over 200 now. Arimidex was great in that respect but I couldn't walk, ended up using a walker. Don't want to go back that route. Its a trade off....I meet with her next week and will get scan results and next plan of action. Sending good thoughts to everyone. üôèüôèüôè",
