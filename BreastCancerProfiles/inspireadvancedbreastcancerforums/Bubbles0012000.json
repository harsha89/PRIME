    "Content": "I have osteonecrosis of the jaw from Zometa, too. My Onc at Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa will not put me on any bisphophonate going forward. I went to an oral surgeon at the University of Miami (Dr. Marks) specializing in ONJ for cancer patients and he told me the drug stays in your system for 11 years. He also told me not to use a different bisphosphonate because they have encountered very bad drug interactions and many oncs are not aware of that issue because they are not oral surgeons. The good news is your zometa is continuing to work.",
