    "Content": "Hi Jeanette, My heart goes out to you but for me Ibrance, Fastodex. and Xgeva have been a God send for me. I have been on this regimen for two years and four months. Have a few side effects(thinning hair, some itchy spots, DRY skin) but small effects for being being NED(no evidence of disease) for 28 months. Yeah! Please stay positive and hope you have much success on your journey. Prayers...Patty",
