    "Content": "As noted by others, your numbness could be caused by pressure on the trigeminal nerve. Although you should rule out cancer, there are other potential causes. I would think that a neurologist connected to a cancer center would be most knowledgeable about what to investigate. I'm sharing my mother's experience to help you communicate with physicians who may not be familiar with the symptoms. She experienced numbness of her lip a few months before she was diagnosed with MBC -- her first recurrence after 3 prior independent breast cancers. The numbness and \"tightness\" spread to her chin fairly quickly. Numerous imaging studies revealed tumors in the bones at the base of her skull in the back of her head and neck and extensive tumor in her mandible. We went to neurologists at the Cancer Institute of NJ and Weill Cornell.",
