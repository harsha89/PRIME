      "Content": "My daughter, age 40, has just been diagnosed with Stage IV metastatic breast cancer. The cancer has spread to lymph nodes and her spine. The cancer is technically described, I think, as \"Hormone Positive Receptive Breast Cancer\". She is a patient at the University of California San Francisco Hospital breast cancer center. Treatment plan is to reduce estrogen levels in her body to a menopausal level and to attack the cancer cells with one or more drugs (don't know their names). I understand this, according to her oncologist, to be the standard of care for this type and stage of breast cancer. The doctor has said that her cancer, at this stage, cannot be eliminated from her body, but that it can be controlled long-term with medication. Any information experience with Stage IV breast cancer and on clinical trials or cutting edge treatments for this type of cancer would be much appreciated.",
