      "Content": "I think my \"favorite\" one is, \"wow! no evidence of disease? when are you going back to work?\" Um.................I still feel like crap and I still take meds and I still have a ton of side effects, but thanks for asking! My husband has a coworker that all she wanted to do was talk to him about my cancer constantly and wanted to know when I was going to die. Recently her mother was diagnosed with ovarian cancer and passed in a matter of months. He went to her to offer his condolences on her loss and she said right away............I don't want to talk about it. He said, I just wanted to say I am sorry, you don't need to talk about it. I think until you actually have cancer touch your life, you just don't get it. Kim B",

      "Content": "I have been stage IV for over two years now. I had it in my lungs and bones. It never hurt really, it was just a struggle my first year because my left lung kept filling to the brim with fluid. That was finally fixed after about a year. Hopefully you have a doctor that you trust, and trust in your treatment. I am currently no evidence of disease and my bones were riddled with spots. Between Ibrance, Letrizole, & Xgeva my body has been put back to a better place. It was not easy and it still is not easy. I had to see a therapist early on and I have had to take medication for anxiety, but I take it a whole less often now. I try my best to stay positive and if at any time I think dark thoughts, I think of my grand children and that puts an instant smile on my face. Don't get me wrong, there are times I need to cry and I just do it and get it over with and then I feel better. I buy myself flowers often and keep them in my craft room to enjoy. They put a smile on my face. I don't know where stage IV is going to take me and neither do my doctors. What I do know is that although I have side effects from the meds and feel achy and exhausted sometimes, I am going to live my life the best I can because you only get one life to live. I am living with no regrets and I refuse to let cancer control me in any way. It's hard and I wish you so much luck. Please get some support to lift you up and live, live, live! Hugs, Kim B",
