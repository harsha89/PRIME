    "Content": "Welcome! You have found a wnderful site. I also feel isolated and depressed but try to do what I can. Usually have so many doctors appts. That it seems they are the only reasons I go out! It's terrible. But I don't have a car which doesn't help. I find that I have too much time to think about mbc as I am retired! There is no support group for mbc patients in my area so these mbc sites are priceless! Feel free to vent and ask questions! Love, Marianne",
