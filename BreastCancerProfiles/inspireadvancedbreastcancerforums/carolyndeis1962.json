      "Content": "Thank you for your support. I did call the hospital patient relations and I filed a written report with ethics point.com, a website on L.B. Memorials website for complaints. I need to go further. I posted a review on YELP about him and came across the exact same type of complaint from a year ago. This doc works in the outpatient surgical center and is in charge of the anesthesia. Either he enjoys watching people suffer or he keeps the meds. ordered for the patient for home parties or for trade. I am not sure how to file a complaint to him and the anesthesia department that is different than the one I did. My husband thinks I need to wait until I get a copy of my medical records for that days surgery, before I find a lawyer, but I hate to wait too long. How many other people has he done this too. I have been so weepy and depressed because I feel helpless. Thank you all for listening",

      "Content": "On April 1, 2019 I had a port placed in my chest by a Charles Kay Raker, md. at Long Beach Memorial Hospital (CA). I had no idea he did not put pain meds in the IV and he began the procedure. First I felt a sharp stab leaving me unable to breathe and then another sharp stab. But the worst wa set to come. As I go some oxygen in my lungs that sadistic animal slices across my chest , talk about searing pain!, and then proceeds to rip apart my skin from the muscle as he shoves the port deep into the skin pocket! I screamed in agony, \u201cYou\u201dre hurting me!,\u201d Not a word was said by anyone. The next thing I know is I\u2019m being wheeled into recovery where I start to cry uncontrollably about the assault that just happened. I feel I need to go to the police. Any advice? Carolyn",
