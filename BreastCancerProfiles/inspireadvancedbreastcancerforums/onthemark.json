      "Content": "There are many nonlinear effects in the human body. You can't say if something has a few percent effect at low dosage on the immune system it just takes longer to see the harm. If it is a minor effect then the consequences can also be minor and most likely are. Otherwise you would see widespread cancers in cannabis users, which isn't apparent.",
