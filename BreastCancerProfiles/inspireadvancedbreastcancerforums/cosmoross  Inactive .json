    "Content": "I agree you should have your DNA run, but keep it private. I use mine to check which meds would or would not work for me. Like I would not benefit from Methotrexate but I can metabolize Azathioprine. What a waste of money and time and sickness it would have been to take that next line drug first. Turned out the hospital used the same company I used so I feel more sure of there findings. At 62 I dont really worry about someone else getting my data but they should not profit from it.
