    "Content": "I think there are two main things that come to mind. Communication and compassion The communication part is between doctors and staff as well as with the loved ones who are worried about their family member. Letting me know what bloodwork was being done and when and for what, what tests needed to be scheduled and when. And letting my husband know things that were going on as well. When he is sitting and waiting for me after surgery and the doctor had told him it would be twenty minutes and no one will tell him anything after an hour and a half, that\u2019s not good communication. Much of this communication comes down to compassion. I think nurses have it but are overworked but it\u2019s important to remember that these patients are important people to someone. They hurt. If you can make it so they get blood taken once a day instead of twice, that would be a blessing. If you can take a moment to let their spouse know that they\u2019re doing well, that would be great. If doctors could regularly check on patients and communicate what their thoughts are, this would be fabulous. I hope that made sense. On a positive note, I\u2019ve loved all of my nurses. They are such great human beings!",
