      "Content": "Worried, I'm sorry to hear your friend attempted suicide and relieved that she was found in time. You and your friend can lean on each other and offer support. Having incurable breast cancer taught me to not live in a variation of either the past or the future. For once in my life I'm living in the present. I'm afraid of pain and leaving my kids, but not to actually die. I think some of us may be surprised that the next life will be better than we could have ever imagined and that there really is life after death. I promised my kids that I will blast myself with every treatment imaginable because they need their mother.",

      "Content": "I have never thought of myself as a success, I just try to stay alive for my youngest to graduate from high school. I tell my mind that it is my task (no matter how unpleasant sometimes) to stay alive for them. The truth is I have a bad marriage and don't get a lot of help at home. I believe in gallows humor, and to make a joke out of every macabre incident, no matter how socially inappropriate or frowned upon. My cancer survivor friend Jim and I joke about starting a graveyard named \"Ozzy's Boneyard,\" since that's the station we listen to on Sirius and he goes to so many funerals. In terms of treatment I'm on hercetin, perjeta and arimidex for my Her2+ breast cancer. I've also had many rounds of radiation and have been on navalbine chemo a couple of years ago. I believe in the truth, no matter how difficult it may be. I knew that I wasn't one of those happy-go-lucky think positive people, so that in my opinion, would have been a losing strategy for my survival.That is why I use the humor and I have a job-to-do strategy to living. Each of us here are different, but also the same. Figure out realistically the best way for you to deal with the cancer. It's funny because I was really down today and crying (which I haven't done in a while). It was only after reading these messages that I began to feel the love and support coming from all of you. We are a family here and we take turns being the strong one and the one who needs that shoulder to cry on. I love my sisters and I'm so grateful to have all of you.",

      "Content": "Thanks insure18, My husband and I have had a 20 year relationship, not much of it good. He is bipolar and can't keep a job despite having a useful degree. He blames all of his problems on my not being supportive, and he never looks at his own behavior. He says mean things to me and I return fire. My kids are both teenagers and difficult to live with, as all teens are. It all gets to be too much sometimes. These pills that keep us alive, esp. the aromatase inhibitors, makes me feel awful so I switched to a new one. I told my oncologist that I wake up every morning transported to the time I lived in New Orleans. I wake up feeling like I have a terrible hangover where I drank and danced too much, except I definitely didn't have fun the night before. I start physical therapy in a couple of days, so I hope that will help. This disease is just depressing sometimes. I'm supposed to have 22 years before I can retire (if I weren't sick) but I can't go back to work until/unless I feel better physically. I'm thinking about writing a book--just self-publish something. I had a crazy upbringing plus the whole cancer thing. I thought it might resonate with others who are having a difficult time for whatever reason. Thank you for encouraging me let it all out. I needed that life preserver.",

      "Content": "Worried, I have a degree in psychology that maybe isn't worth much, but from what I've researched, I found that a certain group consisting of older white males have a higher suicide rate attributed to fear of ill health and loss of mobility. They know that their health may be okay at the moment, but are terrified of the possible future. We are living the nightmares of others, while we somehow do our best to hold it all together. I'm so sorry for your loss. He must have had to deal with an inner turmoil that he kept to himself.",

      "Content": "Hi worried, I'm so sorry for all of the garbage you have to deal with, and I have had to deal with thinning hair too. I found a product called Toppik that helped my hair to look fuller. I also use organic castor oil, which seems to have improved the texture and fullness. I know that people think they're paying us a complement when they tell us we don't look sick, but I feel as though I'm accused of being a faker. My church helped us in the beginning, but I stopped going because of the discomfort of having to sit on the hard benches, or standing too long during the singing. I think they think that I'm faking because I still have breasts, am not skinny and never went bald. If I were really stage IV I shouldn't be alive almost 3 years later. I thought I would be dead too. I just tell people that I'm happy to be stable and that ever day I live, the closer my kids get to adulthood.",

      "Content": "All of these stories go to show that people really don't know how to act, regardless of their professional title. Close to three years ago I was diagnosed with stage IV breast cancer after my very first mammogram. It was in my lymph nodes and bones. My kids were 14 and 11. My GP said that I was in my early 40s and that the average age of breast cancer was 55. He didn't even want to schedule a mammogram, so after the reports were in, his office called to say sorry and to offer an Rx for xanax. My first oncologist said matter of factly, that I had 2-3 years, perhaps 5, and extreme outliers can live 10 years. I didn't take the news well and just got up and left. The next visit I thought I might punch him in the face (not kidding) to see if I could get him to change facial expressions. I dropped him for a good doctor and currently have no active cancer. Regular people told me how I was living their nightmare and I was just \"so brave.\" They are wondering why I'm not dead, or emaciated and have a full head of hair. I even had a PhD nurse I know ask me how my hair grew in so fast after chemo. This is a smart woman too. She really didn't know that not all chemo causes cancer and that some women use immunotherapy to treat cancer. The early days were so hard. I cried all the time and once I ran down the street in a fit of despair, while my family ran after me. They called a local crisis line and I went to this center and slept on an inflatable bed for the night. I would read about alternative cancer treatment. I read garlic was good, so I bought a huge bag of garlic from Costco and ate enormous quantities of it. I smelled horrific, from every pore I stank of garlic and my daughter couldn't even sit next to me. I rode in a police car to the crisis center that night I mentioned and I apologized for the smell. Perhaps the officer thought I had schizophrenia and was doing battle with an imaginary, vicious vampire colony. Things get better in time. When people piss me off, I just say that around 50% of the population will get cancer, and many have no family history, and are in shape. I mean, I've got to get my kicks where I can get them. This site has helped me so much and I don't post as much because of the support I've been given. It has helped me to know I'm not alone and I have others that are here for me and know what I'm going through. You are not alone, ever.",
