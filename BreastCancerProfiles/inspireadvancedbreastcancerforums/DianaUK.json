      "Content": "I have been stable on I/L plus Denosumab since September 2016. I asked my Onc to reduce my dose to 100mg after 6 months. He agreed straight away saying the he felt that 125mg was too high for most people but that the Pharma\u2019s always suggest to start with the highest dose tolerated in the trials. I often wonder if our \u201csize\u201d may also have a bearing on the dose that suits us. I have heard that a number of women successfully take 75mg and I also understand that having a lower dose is better than too many breaks. Good luck.",
