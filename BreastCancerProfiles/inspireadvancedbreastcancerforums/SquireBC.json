      "Content": "I took 1650mg Xeloda morning and evening, 3 large 500mg and a small 150mg. It can give you diarrhea but that balanced my morphine constipation effect! I had extremely mild hand-foot syndrome, I used Udderly Smooth cream overnight every few days on feet with socks. That\u2019s quite a hit of radiation, I had 5 low dose treatments for my lumbar back pain. I\u2019m 70 too, dx MBC 9/15 in bones, it\u2019s throughout my torso and numerous small liver tumours have run together, lungs are OK. I had a CT scan after taking Xeloda 3 months to confirm it was working. You sound really fit, Xeloda did not affect my energy level. Ask your oncologist what they\u2019d recommend. Xeloda is an oral chemo and some do very well on it, others have to switch to another drug like me eventually. It\u2019s worth trying for 3 months. Wishing you all the very best, Angela",

      "Content": "Ibrance worked about 8 months for me, thinned my hair, then Xeloda for a year, hair thickened great! It\u2019s much easier taking pills daily than chemo. I\u2019m now having Paclitaxel since mid-April, once a week 3/4 weeks. Got my hair shaved short but I will lose all. I\u2019d definitely recommend Xeloda first.",

      "Content": "I was on Ibrance and Letrozole. When it quit working I went on Xeloda. Effective for me a year, other folks have gotten two years and more. I\u2019ve had two taxol treatments, they nixed the third of my 3/4 week schedule because of low neutrophils. Next treatment May 14. I definitely recommend Xeloda for as long as it holds metastases stable. My hair thickened too on it. Now after two taxol infusions my hair is falling out so I got a buzz cut from Bill the Barber lol. Last week got a port and once healed can swim. Taxol is more tiring and time-consuming. Good luck Syl70,",
