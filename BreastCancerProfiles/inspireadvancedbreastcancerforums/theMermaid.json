    "Content": "Hi Suzie, Please don't worry! And you can always change your screen name to WorriedNoMore ;-). I've been on Ibrance and Letrozole for about 17 months now, and I, too, had to reduce from 125s to 100s and then the 75s. I was too frequently sick, suffered terrible fatigue and painful mouth, and because of it I needed many breaks. On the 75s I'm barely aware I'm on treatment, and from what I have read, the effectiveness seems to be on par with the strongest dose, so why would we put ourselves thru that needlessly? I'm quite content on Ibrance 75mg. and intend on having a long run with it! Living life to the fullest every day! Sending you all the best!",
