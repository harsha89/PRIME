      "Content": "Sometimes I see those ads several times a day. I watch TV for relaxation and escape from reality, mainly. When these ads pop up it just reminds me (us) what we are dealing with. We do not need to be reminded !! My son is an Physician and he says he has patients come in everyday and ask to be prescribed some medication that was advertised on TV. In most cases, he says, the meds are not even appropriate for the condition and he has to spend valuable time convincing patients that the medication will not help them.",

      "Content": "Personally, I hate those ads. Ibrance failed completely for me. I was on it only three months before progression. The ads make it sound like MBC is a walk in the park and practically a cure for MBC. No one can believe how expensive it is in reality either. BI I think that ads for medicines for any number of different diseases and MBC have no place on TV. But that is my opinion.",
