    "Content": "I listen to the doctors, then go home and use the internet to research peer reviewed published articles related to my problem, I may post a few questions on a patient board to ask others who have the condition. I will then try to get a clear picture of the pros and cons of the decision and the odds of each occurring As a gambler and a bit of a risk taker, I will try to find the solution that offers the best odds of a good outcome with the minimal amount of medical intervention. I will then go back to the doctor and discuss my findings and the decision I am leaning towards. I will get their opinion and then either get a second opinion if it is a very major surgery or else just make a decision myself if it is less major. REPLY",
