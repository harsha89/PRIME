      "Content": "So I don't even know where to start..My Mom had been at the hospital 90% of the time since February. We got to the point she needed blood transfusions every other day. At Moffitt they tried to treat all kind of blood disorders to no success. Bone marrow biopsy came clean, so the only suspicion left that its cancer induced blood issue so they started her on chemo AC-T regimen . 1 week after AC being administered all her blood numbers tanked ( please tell me is it pretty normal numbers after chemo or are they low enough to consider to change chemo? ??white blood cells were 0.4 the lowest after 7 shots of Neupogen, platelets were down to 11) and she got blood infection, which sent her back to the hospital for another week. However the chemo seems to work! Her hemoglobin and platelets are up and stable with no transfusions! Moffitt wants to keep giving her AC-T (( my understanding is that it is pretty rare given to stage 4, but they decided on it because of how often it is given - AC (doxorubicin/Adriamycin and Cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan) every 2 weeks for 4 times and then Paclitaxel (Taxol) weekly for another 8 weeks.) However our Orlando Dr. from UF cancer center thinks that it will kill her ( and he might be right!!!) and recommends switching to either Taxol weekly or Doxil monthly. He explains that Doxil is very similar to Doxorubicin but with much less side effects and less impact on blood counts. Even assuming those 2 are the same, If we switch to Doxil we will loose the combo of Cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan) and the frequency ( biweekly vs monthly). Is it safe to predict that if Doxorubicin worked the Doxil will work too? I guess I'd like to hear your thoughts and possibly similar stories too...",

      "Content": "Hi Anne! I don't know what I was thinking not to list all details. She is stage 4, ER+, pr-, her2 - withbone Mets only, but potentially some lung Mets too. Been on letro/ibrance for a year and affinitor/arimidex for another year with a lot of side effects. I read your guide multiple time. Greta work! Thank you! As of now we hear that doxil/cytoxan combo won get approved by insurance so out options are either doxil only monthlyin our home city or doxorubicin/cytoxan at Moffitt biweekly, which means 2 HR drive.",
