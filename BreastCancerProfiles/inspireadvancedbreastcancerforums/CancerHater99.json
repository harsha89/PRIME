      "Content": "My wife started DS-8201a three weeks ago after TDM-1 failed and the cancer spread to her lung. Today she is getting her second infusion. After she had it first time, she had nausea and was down for a few days. But, she regained her energy and does her normal daily life including her part time job, prayer, walking, cooking, watching netflix movies, etc. She suspects a little bit of hair loss, but the doctor told her that probably it is not due to the drug side effect. Hope this drug works for your daughter for a long time!",

      "Content": "My wife took CT scan yesterday and the result is very promising. All of her tumors shrank by 30+% after she had two infusions of DS8201a (5.4 dose). She did not have anti nausea drug previously but plan to have that from the next infusion. As I understand from Lpburwell, Aloxi may cause severe headache, which we want to avoid. So it looks like Zofran is a good option to try.",
