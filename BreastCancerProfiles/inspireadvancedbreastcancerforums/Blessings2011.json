    "Content": "My degree is in medical counseling, so I research the hell out of anything that comes my way. I seek out not only clinical/research data, but also anecdotal data, such as the personal stories found on the Inspire site and other support group sites. I talk to doctors, nurses, and other medical staff when I can. For so many of the serious medical conditions my husband and I have experienced, we had absolutely no control over the outcome, and that's what made it scary. Conducting my research made me feel like at least I was DOING something..... and in my book, knowledge is power. (I now have LOTS of knowledge in the areas of breast cancer, FSGS, traumatic brain injuries, sleep disorders, and, well, a list too long to type here.) I also do Medical Management for several family members. I have been called on as the \"Family Expert\" when a serious decision has to be made. Generally, I take all the information I have gathered, sift it down into layman's terms, spell out each alternative, and see what the family member ultimately wants to do, and help them discuss the risk vs benefit of each decision. For personal medical issues, I take all our questions to our doctors. I do not let them leave the room until they answer all my questions, and sometimes my typed questions are three pages long. If they don't know the answer, I want them to refer me to someone who does. So what do we ultimately do with all that data and all those suggestions the professionals make? We pray, and wait for God's guidance. He ALWAYS answers.... \"Yes\", \"No\", or \"Not right now.\" All of our choices have been the right ones.",
