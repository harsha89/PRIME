      "Content": "Patient centered, not dollar centered. Smaller staff to patient ratio. As rural hospitals disappear, what's to replace local emergency, local wound care, local education, local rehab? As more rural hospitals are the only employers for all the local doctors, where's the focus? I can tell you, from my experience, it's not on prevention, it's not on wellness.

We all want to have a COE in our neighborhood, but they, for lots of reasons, go to the population density areas. All budgets have flexibility...if someone is looking.",

      "Content": "Thanks for bringing this up for discussion. I, too, agree that if you \"follow the money\" you get to the reason for this testing. I, too, agree that the opportunity for abuse is rampart, even if - technically - not yet fully developed. This will be a divisive discussion as, unfortunately, lots of subjects are these days. I urge civility. I urge all to read to learn, to form, perhaps, multiple views...views dependent on specific situations. Once this bell is rung, it cannot be unrung.",
