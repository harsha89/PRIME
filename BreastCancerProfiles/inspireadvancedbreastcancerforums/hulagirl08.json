    "Content": "Hello Angelical, I too, was diagnosed with tnbc two years ago. And, like you could only think about Cancer everyday for the first six months!.....Then, I decided that I was going \"to be the Victor, not the Victim!! I read-up, & watched YOUTUBE videos that gave me hope, and followed their \"all natural Integrative protocols, and I began to feel better mentally & physically, as I now believe that tnbc can be treated like any cronic disease. You just have to stay on top of it! .....About four months ago, I started watching Joel Osteen for one sermon \"of hope,\" each morning, and that, again, has helped me.....I hope my story, along with the other supportive messages help you to overcome your depression!.....Good Luck & God Bless!üòçüòç",
