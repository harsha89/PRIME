    "Content": "I had a bilateral mastectomy in 2016 to address Stage 3 BC, followed by chemo and then radiation on one side. The implant on the side with no radiation is fine. The implant on the side where I had radiation got hard as a rock and lifted up. I had it replaced 2 months ago and already it is encapsulating again. My plastic surgeon is recommending a flap, but he cautioned me that flap surgery could trigger lymphedema, which really worries me. When I asked if they could just be removed (I'm nearly 60 and don't really care whether or not I have breasts), he told me \"we don't like to do that.\" That response kinda pissed me off: I felt he was being dismissive. My questions for the forum is this: have any of you faced this decision (flap or just take 'em out)? What did you decide? And why? Finally: are you happy with your decision? Thanks for sharing!",
