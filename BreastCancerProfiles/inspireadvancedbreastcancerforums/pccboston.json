    "Content": "My late wife got Xeloda, then Taxol two years later. Xeloda worked well for her. It was oral, so she did not have to come in for chemo. She had some thinning, but not total hair loss. She was able to lead a pretty normal life with Xeloda - traveling, cooking, working. Taxol was much more taxing for her. She had to come in weekly, plus get Neupogen shots for two consecutive days thereafter. She went to the hospital three times a week. Plus, a lot more of her hair fell out.",
