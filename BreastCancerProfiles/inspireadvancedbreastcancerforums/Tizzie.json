    "Content": "Thank you! Always appreciate your posts. I've seen some women in the ovarian cancer group say that a few rounds of immunotherapy seemed to boost the tumor's sensitivity to subsequent chemo. That is, they tried immunotherapy and it \"didn't work\" (i.e, cancer progressed) or else toxicities were unacceptable. So they switched back to chemo. And the chemo suddenly seemed to work miraculously well, shrinking tumors rapidly. Have you heard of that phenomenon?",
