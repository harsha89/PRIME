      "Content": "Edgerider, Thanks so much again for all the information. I wonder if my minor progression with new small spinal lesion on Ibrance (combined with Letrozole) is due to Rebound G1/S Activation which builds during my Ibrance off week. I don\u2019t think we will ever know for sure but regardless, after 2 1/2 years on Ibrance and now with slight progression in spine, I have decided to give Verzenio a try in combination with Letrozole. I know the next big change is to Faslodex but I would like to prolong my time on a CDK4/6 inhibitor as long as possible. So far my mets is widespread to bone but no where else. Wish me luck :) Again, thank you for your vast knowledge and time. Greatly appreciated!!!",

      "Content": "Thank you all very much!! That article was very interesting. May be worth a 28 day Ibrance holiday and then restarting Ibrance or newly starting Verzenio. I will, of course, discuss these options with my onc. Just feeling like it may be time to try something new and not necessarily be bound to evidenced based care due to lack of available data of newer options. Seems to me I don\u2019t have much to lose as the cancer metastisized anyway even with the recommended treatment. Feeling empowered to make treatment decisions that may be slightly unorthodox but certainly not foolhardy or contraindicated as I really want to live!!",

      "Content": "Hi All, After 30 months on Ibrance I now have new mild progression on my spine. After doing some reading I am changing my Ibrance schedule (with my onc\u2019s consent) to 5 days on and 2 days off for the whole month rather than the usual 21 days on and 7 days off. I know there is no research to support this but I am wondering if a more steady dose of Ibrance with just 2 days off at a time rather than the entire week off will halt the progression. My calculations indicate that 5 days on and 2 days off delivers approximately the same amount as 21 days on and 7 days off. And perhaps the new schedule will keep my counts up and my cancer growth down. Has anyone else done this or had any experience with changing the recommended Ibrance schedule? Thanks so much!",

      "Content": "Hi All, Has anyone out there started Verzenio on the LOWEST dose rather than starting with the HIGHEST dose? I am starting Verzenio next month after progression on Ibrance. I will remain on Letrozole and would be switching from Ibrance to Verzenio. I was only able to tolerate Ibrance at 75mg after starting at 125mg and decreasing to 100mg and then to 75mg. I am wondering if starting on the LOWEST dose of Verzenio would help me deal with the SE\u2019s of low blood counts, diarrhea and nausea. My Onc is open to my considerations. I am more interested in minimum effective dose than maximum tolerated dose. Anyone have any experiences or thoughts to share? All the Verzenio SE\u2019s are scaring me!! Overall I tolerated 75mg of Ibrance pretty well but now have new lesion on spine and others larger. Time for a change... Thanks!",

I was wondering- if the Verzenio does not agree with you, meaning too many adverse side effects, would you be able to go back on Ibrance since it sounds like you did so well on that? Are people able to go back and forth between Ibrance and Verzenio? For example 2 years on Ibrance- then Verzenio for 1 year- then back on Ibrance? Just to mix things up with known and unknown side effects?",

My onc suggested not changing medications for now and continuing to monitor the situation. When time comes, probably in a few months, onc recommends switching to Ibrance and Faslodex. But I am considering changing to VERZENIO with Letrozole just to see if it shakes things up a bit and gives the cancer something new to contend with. My onc indicates this is not contraindicated but not his first choice either as there is no data to support this. Has anyone out there switched from Ibrance to Verzenio after having progression on Ibrance? Was it effective? Side effects? Thoughts? Thanks so much!!",
