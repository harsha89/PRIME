      "Content": "You're a blessing to your mother. I was my daughters advocate & you are your moms. It's not easy, as a matter of fact...their bravery & fight now hurts me so much. Try to get her outside, if it's nice to sit on the porch or a bench in the park. Does she usually go to Church, if so please get her there. Let her enjoy scenery, just a short ride to the beach or a park. Gods art...the birds, the flowers etc. are a huge uplift when Sick. The sun feels so good‚úåÔ∏è No one knows when our time to be in heaven is...expect miracles for your mom. Bless you sweetheartüôè",
