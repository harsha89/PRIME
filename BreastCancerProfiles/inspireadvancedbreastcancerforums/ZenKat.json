    "Content": "Hi ycats, I am on Ibrance, Faslodex and Zometa... I tend to feel achey much of the time and take morphine extended release twice daily, which really does help. Also, for the crying and depression, Faslodex messes with our hormones which can cause serious depression. You might talk to your doctor about an anti-depressant (I know, more meds! ugh), but it helps me stay stable and nearly eliminated by crying spells. Don't know when you were diagnosed, but once you adjust mentally to all this, there will be a new normal, not so overwhelming. Sending love.",
