      "Content": "my oncologist doesn't use the work remission any more. They say NED instead. No Evidence of Disease. I don't think I am in that category, because I am only good as long as the treatments are working. So far I have been three years since the Stage 4 Diagnosis and doing great. There are a lot of people on this site who have been free for much longer than that. I had some small side effects at the beginning, but I think my body has adapted and I don't have side effects (SE) and more.! Good luck to you and your daughter!",

I had mouth sores in the first months and got a perscription for \"Magic Mouthwash\" from the pharmacist. My body seems to have adjusted, because I don't get them any more. I have stocked up on SolanPas Pain patches when they are on sale at Costco. My pains come at night...and I slap on a pain patch and take some advil. I have sleep problems many nights. My primary care gave me Elavil for anxiety and to help sleep. We Don't want a \"sleeping Pill\" because I already have fatigue during the day,.. Nausea...I have only occasionally, but the doctor gave me a pill for that. My point is: take each side effect as it comes and it might even go away. You will get through the side effects. God Bless!",

Over the first year on Ibrance, Faslodex & Xgeva that tumor shrank and now has been totally gone for the last two years. I am sorry you have had to go through so much. Have hope, they keep coming up with new therapies and results are better than they thought. Prayers for you.",
