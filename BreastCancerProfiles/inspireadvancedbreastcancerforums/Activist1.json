      "Content": "It sounds like we've embarked on a similar experiment. In January, after 21 or 22 cycles of stability on Ibrance, my bone scan identified a small sclerotic lesion in my left scapula with conspicuous radiotracer uptake. I'd done some reading and wondered if a 5 day on 2 day off schedule would provide better suppression than 21 days on and 7 days off. I started the new schedule March 4th. On followup bone scan (April 16th), the scapular lesion was less conspicuous, but I had slight increase in uptake in a rib. So, the jury is still out and I'm continuing the new schedule. Two sets of labs have been similar to previous except that my platelet counts hav been better.",

      "Content": "I don't like the Ibrance and Verzenio commercials because they get too much air time and are an ever-present reminder of my breast cancer. I'm approaching the 5-year mark and feel lucky that I can otherwise live my life without thinking about cancer except on clinic days (every 28 days for labs and Faslodex shots). I've been stable enough that see my oncologist every 3 months (only 4 times a year). For me, at this point, my life is a \"new normal\" and it's reassuring to see women carrying on with their lives (the way I do). Granted, things can and will change. I've had mets to soft tissue (lungs, intrathoracic lymph nodes) and bones (spine, ribs, hip), so I'm not disease-free by any stretch. But I'm living my life with occasional excursions to in-person and/or online support groups to touch base and keep up with others (and for new research, some of which is amazing). In any event, I relate to those ads. And on a couple occasions, I've been asked to give input (marketing research) and I had no complaint with the content of the ads, just the frequency. Seriously, you want the ads to feature people freaking out in clinic waiting rooms or what? Send the drug companies some reasonable suggestions. They seem to be listening. p.s. I was also called \"sir\" a couple times during chemo when I was flat chested and bald but wearing nail polish and girly clothes and accessories. One time as I was walking from the parking lot to the grocery store, a small child pointed at me and said, \"Mommy, look at that woman with no hair...she has no hair!\" The mother was obviously embarrassed, but I just laughed and told her not to worry about it. My comment was, \"I'm just happy she could see that I'm a woman...not everyone can.\" So, truly, if you're looking for indignities, you can find them anywhere and everywhere all day long, but I choose not to. Go ahead and hate me, but I just don't see any point in wallowing, she said as gently as possible. Edited May 25, 2019 at 12:42 pm",
