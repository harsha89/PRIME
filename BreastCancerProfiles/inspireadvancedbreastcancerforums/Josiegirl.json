      "Content": "Waldebet, you are so sweet to think of me! That's why I love this site. Just saw my onc. No new lesions and reduction of activity on existing ones. As usual, I had prepared for the worst, so you could have knocked me over with a feather! The labs not so good. Still great liver function numbers but neutropenic again. Now I'll do just one verzenio every other day instead of two. AND my very reliable CEA tumor marker dropped another 15 points in a month, a total of 30 points in two months. I'm hoping verzenio gives me a good run. Hope you are well...ðŸ’œ",

Iexmpra, 16 IVs over 10 months, progression. Now verzenio, reduced dose from 150 to 100 to 50 with faslodex. As you can see, I've been through the wringer. And that's having done xeloda and halaven prior to ibrance. I need a new drug to get approved for my genetic composition! Hope this info helps. ðŸ’œ",

After almost 8 years with liver mets....really, I'm not kidding, 8 years...woo hoo... i now wake up every day and while still in bed say out loud \"today I am going to be happy\". It helps get me in the right frame of mind. I also walk the beach with my dog every day and although I am not religious, I open my arms to the sky and say out loud \"thank you for another day\"....I guess I'm thanking the universe...lol...I was fortunate to get to meet two women on this site. That was great...i also read a lot, tell no one I have cancer and live life like it isn't happening. I take my meds, but try not to dwell on it all. So hard.... The best to you. ðŸ’œ",
