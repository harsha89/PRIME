      "Content": "Mouth sores prompted a prescription for Gelclair that my insurance would not cover and the charge was $700. Neither my oncologist or the pharmacist mentioned that we can go online and look up our meds and often get a coupon. Also, my drug store has a $20/year prescription savings card that in this 1st instance saved me $700! The copay is $0 with this $20/year card. I surely hope that this brings relief to some of you fellow fighters.",
