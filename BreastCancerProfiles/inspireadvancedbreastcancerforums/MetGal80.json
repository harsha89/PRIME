    "Content": "I have switched to Verzenio/ Faslodex after progression on Ibrance/letrozole. Or I should say I am trying to switch. I started on 200mg per day, but that only lasted 2 weeks because my neutrophils and platelets were too low to continue. After a month off, I am restarting at 100mg/day. While the tumors in my liver haven't decreased, my liver function has stabilized. Fingers crossed for all of us!",
