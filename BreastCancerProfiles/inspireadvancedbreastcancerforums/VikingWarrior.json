It is called the Insiders Guide to Metastatic Breast Cancer by Anne Loeser. Here is the link: https://www.amazon.com/Insiders-Guide-Metastatic-Breast-Cancer/d... Best wishes and hugs to you and your wife. Carrie",

      "Content": "Sounds very good. My surgeon said that a Ki67 below 19% means that the cancer is growing so slow that it may not respond to chemo so I was put on just hormonal therapy, (Lupron to shut down ovaries and Arimidex as my aromatase inhibitor). Ki67 basically measures how many of the cancer cells were dividing at the time the tumor was removed. My Ki67 was 20% so I was on the fence and I had some of the tumor sent to OncoType and I got a score of 0 so I then was sure I didn't want to do chemo. Hugs, Carrie",

      "Content": "You need a breast MRI!! Lobular breast cancer often does not show up on mammograms. It shows up on MRIs. About 90% of breast cancers start in the milk ducts and are called ductal carcinoma. Lobular is less common and tends to be missed since it is harder to diagnose. At the very least get a 3D ultrasound of the breast. It can be seen on ultrasound quite often and maybe a quick and cheaper way to proceed. And good for you for advocating for yourself and reaching out. Let us know if you need more advice. We are happy to share. Hugs to you. Carrie",

I agree with Beatez, it is just a setback and at least it isn't in a bad place. But of course, I understand your anxiety. I struggle with keeping positive. Sending you a virtual hug. Carrie",
