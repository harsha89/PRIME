      "Content": "I've noticed she really likes very expensive purses, jewelry, clothes and vehicles so it might have been as simple as the easy money she thought she could make. Still, highly inappropriate and insensitive, hopefully not reflective of all mortuaries which could try to take advantage when one is most vulnerable.
