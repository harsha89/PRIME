    "Content": "I know they ads make money. but I actually like them, especially the Ibrance ones since I am on Ibrance/Letrozole. When \"Julie\" first came on the ad I told some people about the ad (a little lightheartedly since I didn't want to be morbid about my MBC) . I said I guess I am like her ---MBC with Ibrance is my new norm. The ad helped them better understand what I was going through. My Nurse Practitioner said it helped her explain the treatment to one patient. Now that Versenio is on the scene, I asked my NP about it and she said some Oncs are using it as a 2nd line of treatment. So I learned about a new use of Versenio from the ad.",
