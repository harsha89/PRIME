Do you have any written info on this direction that I could share with my doctor whose protocol is two weeks on one week off? Seems that it has many benefits. Thank you for anything you can share",

      "Content": "Thanks for the info. At my visit they asked that I complete two more cycles and get the next scan before any changes. In the mean time they sent my case to a board to review to see if I should go off and wait and see if I continue to be NED. Have mixed emotions but it would feel good to feel 100% again.",
