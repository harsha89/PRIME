      "Content": "Hi Hilltopper! You have come to the right place for info and support. I was diagnosed stage IV this past December. Mets to the bones. Two weeks after getting the news, I had an 18\" nail placed in my R femur because my team was concerned about a fracture. (I had to promise them that I would take it easy so that they would support me waiting until after Christmas.) 6 weeks after that I had my ovaries removed. I am HR positive, HER2 negative and I am on Kisqali and Letrozole. I have minimal side effects and my tumor markers have already reduced since I began. I meditate and visualize every day which helps me feel like I have some say in how my body is responding. I am going for NED and I keep that thought front and center at all times! Sending your daughter, and you! healing energy!",
