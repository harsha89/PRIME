      "Content": "I too am so sorry for your experience. I had a port placed many years ago without ANY pain. You need to get as far away from that doctor as possible! Seek someone other than him for follow ups. Report the incident to everyone that will listen to avoid this from happening to anyone one else. Sounds like someone forgot to administer the sedation and pain meds. Legal assistance may be warranted now. You are dealing with so much right now. All doctors are not like him. Try to breathe and rest to allow for healing. You are in my thoughts and prayers....",
