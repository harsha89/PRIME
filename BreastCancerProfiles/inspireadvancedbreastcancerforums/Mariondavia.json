    "Content": "Yes, there were trials on antiCd47, but frustratingly slow. It seemed as if they were running into problems of safety and the phases were not forthcoming. Celgene got involved and other drug companies. Changes were made by adding other drugs. Somehow, now, it's back. I need to read and catch up on what really happened. Thanks for the post, fighterm. Hope you are doing well with your health issues!",
