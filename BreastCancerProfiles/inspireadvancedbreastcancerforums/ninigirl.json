    "Content": "Hi Brian! Remember me? We had our quibble over my 3billion (whole exome sequencing beta trial) post! I have a few comments; I think precision medicine will be becoming more and more prevalent whether we like it or not. Sequencing prices are falling, and the insurance and medical community see the value of its ability to predict treatment outcomes and the likely development and progression of disorders. However, there is so much that is unknown in genetics! I cannot emphasize that enough! We are at the very, very beginning of our understanding! I, like many of you, have mixed feelings on this issue. I love the idea of knowledge, but I hate the idea of people/businesses grabbing and 'owning' genetic information to make a profit or to deny treatment. Like the (mostly) free and open Internet, all of us should be able to benefit together on discoveries. I think Dwindle put it beautifully; \"Simply put, if we matter to each other, there exist no borders, nor separations of spirit, when it is accepted that, collectively, every voice counts when a fellow human being is wounded ... both seen and unseen.\" Unfortunately, research takes money. In a perfect world, everyone would get healthcare, no matter what, and scientists would all share information. However, the future will probably hold legal and governmental battles between restriction and freedom... For me, the bottom line is the more we know, the better it could be for everyone. For those of you who would like to participate in sharing, I have offered a thread which introduces the Precision Medicine Initiative--where anyone can donate data about themselves to help promote universal knowledge; https://www.inspire.com/groups/ehlers-danlos-syndromes-and-relat... (Take note Brian, this is backed by the NIH and does not involve any fees or ownership of our biology!)",
