      "Content": "LMarie, I am about to start Verzenio but have had to wait. because I have been having diarrhea and need to get that under control first. This will be my 7th drug, some oral and some IV. It is heartening to hear that you have found it effective and have also used Prilosec successfully to control the worst side effects. I have lobular mbc with mets to the GI tract and the bones. I am taking Femara at the same time and will have shots of Xgeva as well since there is a lot of cancer in my bones. Thank you for this post. Joan",

      "Content": "Sarah, For l-glutamine, I take it in apple cider or apple juice. It is still unpleasant and grainy,but better than with water. I am using carrot sticks for constipation. I have pretty bad neuropathy already from Abraxane, which did work for me for a year, so the added neuropathy from Halaven is not much fun. And I have about an inch of relatively normal hair with very tight curls at the tips. Joan",

      "Content": "I just started Halaven on Tuesday. So far constipation is one side effect, but I also get Aloxi for the nausea, and that also causes constipation. For hair loss, on a web page where a doctor was reporting research on Halaven's effectiveness in a trial, a doctor from Dana Farber participating in the trial said her patients had some hair loss, but not enough to require a wig. I lost all my hair in Abraxane, but then it began growing back. Gemzar, which I was on after that, was supposed to cause hair loss, but it didn\u2019t. However, my doctor said to expect hair loss on Halaven, while the nurses giving the chemo said it varied from person to person. The other side effect that concerns is neuropathy, and I already have that pretty badly. I take gabapentin for that, and I had my dose increased to hopefully prevent even worse neuropathy. Joan",
