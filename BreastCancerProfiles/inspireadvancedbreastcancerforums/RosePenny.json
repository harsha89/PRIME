    "Content": "Hi Brian I listened to the doctor, nurses, talked to other patients, Bestbird and a number of members of Inspire helped me understand my options. I followed what made me feel the most comfortable. I sifted through, decided on my treatment plan. Luckily my oncologist and I were together on what would work out best. He believed the same as I, that surgery for my spread was best. Then a wait and see if/when it shows up again. Three years ned so far. hugs Rose",
