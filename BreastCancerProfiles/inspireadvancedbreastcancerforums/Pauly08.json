    "Content": "Claudepa, I came across your post about the combination of a vaccine +GMCSF + Pembrolizumab and I'm happy to see that this combination has worked for your wife as well. I have been also treated with a combined vaccine in Germany and I feel happy to see your comments about the overall complete remission rates with Pembrolizumab because I also think that the vaccine made the major difference for me. May I ask where your wife is getting treated? In regard to the combination of Atezolizumab and Abraxane I know of several patients who are receiving a combination that consists of Abraxane plus Ipilimumab plus Nivolumab plus a vaccine in PD-L1 negative TNBC at my clinic, although I do not understand why one would use a PD-1 antibody without PD-L1 positivity? Is there an advantage to use Nivolumab or Pembrolizumab over Atezolizumab? What is the reason for the combination with Ipilimumab?",
