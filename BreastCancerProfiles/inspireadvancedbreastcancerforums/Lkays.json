    "Content": "If that were true I would not be here. Even though my oncologist thought I was probably not going to make it he never once said anything except positive support. I went 7 years with stage 2 after Ned. then Mets with ten tumors in all stage 4 triple negative. I went a year and a half of treatment and I\u2019ve been Ned 6 years from stage 4 TNBC Mets. I do think my success has been through eating healthy, limiting dairy and sugar and my wonderful supplement Ip6 and inositol. We are all different but I\u2019m still here and no lingering side effects. My oncologist is very surprised as well as my radiologist. So oncologists should not give a prediction. We can all read the statistics ourselves. Sorry that yours told you that. Lkays",
