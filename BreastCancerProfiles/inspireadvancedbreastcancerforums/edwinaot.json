    "Content": "Hi Jeanette sorry you have had this news. I\u2019m on ibrance and letrozole ( similar to faslodex) since July 2018. My liver tumour shrunk significantly so I had a radiofrequency ablation to get rid of it, my scan is on Saturday to see if it worked. Other tumours in my bones are now healing over. So far the results have been good. Downside I do suffer a lot of muscle and bone pain and this can be really bad and fatigue. But it\u2019s price worth paying for the results. My best wishes to you.",
