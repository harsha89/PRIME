      "Content": "In stage 4 forum because my diagnosis started there. The lump in my breast was misdiagnosed as benign. Two years later got a shocking wake up call doctor was very wrong and so sure of himself didnt advize to do a biospy.Everyone deals in their own way. Have been through this journey with friends and family who struggled with this dreaded disease. No judging anyone's way of dealing. Lots of ups and downs. I think everyone can look at their life and remember events that didn't take the natural course of events. I am a science teacher...If you meditate on the structure and workings of one cell,you realize that life itself is miraculous. An egg and a sperm meet,in a one out of 250,000 million chance to be you. And from the first moment all the information for your entire life is there. When you will get teeth as a baby to getting your period ...the blueprint for all your limbs and organs contained in a cell to small to be seen in a microscope let alone a human eye. When I feel really low I look into how the eye sees,how we digest our food....how we breath .Thousands of reactions and steps that take place in less than a blink of an eye. All the things we take for granted are perfectly orchestrated. In conclusion life is a miracle and life is a journey full of blessings and challenges. To look forward to a cure seems reasonable. Why it hasn't come yet is baffling considering all the research world wide. Thinking good has been scientifically proven to produce good. Not easy! Sharing on this forum often helps. Wishing everyone healing and well being and much support and love to cope.",

We all need to ask ourselves, what good comes out of worry.....I'm a chronic worrier. The true answer is nothing. It's not the same at all as trying to some soul searching accounting. Thinking good on the other hand actually affects reality and channels good. It's a good habit to adopt. The benefits well out weigh the hard work it takes. Wishing everyone healing and well being. May you be blessed with many good years with your current treatment.",

Almost was afraid to move. Started taking walks more regularly and feel so much better. Doctors don't seem to know much about diet. I heard from two highly respected alternative practitioners that when it comes to diet if you are stressed out by limiting yourself the stress can cancel out the benefits. We all need balance...",

It was very helpful to read the long time survivors blog here.They do exist and let's face it , it's encouraging. The One Above gave doctors the right to heal others not to share doomsday prophecies, even with their good intentions. I've found coping comes in cycles and that makes it real. I've been on Ibrance and letrozol and most of the time feel well, do have fatigue almost like a sleeping pill when it hits....I haven't adjusted to it very well yet, open to helpful suggestions. May you be blessed with well being, positivity and a complete cure. Thankfulness, doing good for others and positive thinking all go a long way...and it's work, takes effort",

The first doctor to diagnose we,turned down the light and shared a relation technique,only a year later I appreciate his good intentions. Walking,smiling, and expressing thankfulness for all the things we tend to take for granted ,help with tge anxiety. As well as being able to share. Thank you so much for taking the time to respond,it truly helped. Can feel the hug all the way overseas where I live.",
