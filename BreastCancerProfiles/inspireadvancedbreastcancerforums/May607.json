Unfortunately, both my dentist and oncologist is telling me to go back on the zometa . From the info and experiences you and other people in similar situation shared, I feel it\u2019s better if I don\u2019t resume the zometa infusions. I will be getting CT scan next week and will discuss with oncologist about not resuming the Zometa. I\u2019m still getting some tooth pain in same area where I had the jaw necrosis .",

      "Content": "Hello, does anyone have similar experience with jaw necrosis (bits of dead bone sticking out of gum) from zometa infusion for stage 4 breast cancer with bone Mets? Have been on zometa infusion for 8 years , every 16 weeks infusion before this problem started last May. My oncologist wants me to restart the zometa now that the jaw necrosis seems to be gone. But I am worried it will start again once I restart the zometa. I was off it for the last year. Are other kinds of bisphosphonates such as fosamox , pamidronate less likely to cause jaw necrosis compared to zometa? What else can be done to help strengthen bone due to damage caused by the bone Mets in spine, ribs if I don\u2019t take the zometa infusion? I am currently taking Ibrance and letrozole for the stage 4 breast Cancer, have been on these for two years, causing low platelets and neutrophils . Thanks, MayðŸ˜Š",
