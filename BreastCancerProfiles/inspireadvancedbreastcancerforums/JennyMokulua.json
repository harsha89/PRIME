    "Content": "I too had a surgical procedure in Long Beach end of January, but at a surgicenter. Had a lymph node biopsy under the arm. Offered 3 types of anaesthesia: local only, local with sedation or a GA. Chose option 2...big mistake. Felt everything including cautery 3 times. Because I was holding my breath in anticipation of the pain the anesthetist ended up putting me out. I have had experiences when local hasn\u2019t worked well for me but now I\u2019m wondering. GA in the future for sure. I have had 2 ports placed with no pain under light sedation.",
