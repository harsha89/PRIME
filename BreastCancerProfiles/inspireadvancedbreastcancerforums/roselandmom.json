    "Content": "Fighterm ... I'm sorry to go off topic but with your vast knowledge and expertise I would love to know if you know of any options stopping brain metastasis? My son - a never smoker - at 23 was dx with stage 4 cancer (atypical lung neuroendocrine carcinoma - very aggressive) and after several treatment modalities and steadily and very quickly going downhill - at the age of 25 was given Opdivo. He has been an excellent responder and literally hundreds of tumors are now gone. Our aim now is to stop all of the brain mets from the lung cancer. It boggles the mind that most people with brain mets are usually excluded from clinical trials. He has had WBR and several SBRT and recently underwent two major brain operations in a 27 hour timeframe for necrosis which was in a very precarious part of the brain from which he does have transient paralysis ... are there no systemic drugs that have a low enough molecular weight that cross the BBB? ... we are hesitant to return to radiation as the neurosurgeon said he would now be more likely to have necrosis since this past episode was quite large ... any input from you would be very much appreciated and welcomed! Many Thanks for ALL you do for everyone here on Inspire! You are a true Blessing in every since of the word!",
