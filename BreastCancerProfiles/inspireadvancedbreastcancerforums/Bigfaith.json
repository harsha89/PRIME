    "Content": "Hi everyone, I was just wondering if there was anyone else out there who has/had mets to the pleura in the lung? I was originally diagnosed with stage 2b breast cancer in 2005. Then in May of 2014, I was diagnosed with mets to the right lung pleura. My PET Scan in 2014 stated extensive medistinal adenopathy and metastatic nodules in the right lung. To date, I have been on same meds (Lupron, Faslodex/Arimidex combo) since 2014. In Nov 2015, my CT scan mentioned a pleural based finding in my right lung apex. A CT Scan in Mar 2016 reported stable to slightly progressed in my right lung apex, but Jun 2016 stated no change. Since Jan 2017 the apex area has been described as pleural consolidation with air bronchograms. In Aug 2018, my area of plueral consolidation was measured by a radiologist as increasing from 2 cm to 2.5 cm (from Jan 2018 to Aug 2018). However, every single nodule that has been visible since 2014, has not once increased in size. I think I am just looking to see if anyone else has mets to the pleura, and how did it go? Also, does anyone have anything similiar with air bronchograms or pleural thickening? Blessings, Bigfaith",
