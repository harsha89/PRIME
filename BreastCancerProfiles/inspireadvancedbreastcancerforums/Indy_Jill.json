    "Content": "Hi! I was diagnosed Stage 4 October 2014. Did Letrozole for 3.5 years and have been on Verzenio and Faslodex since his past June. I had a hard time dealing with the diagnosis for the first year, but an antidepressant finally helped. I still go through times where I don\u2019t want to be around my friends and I stay shut in the house. I recently started using the pedometer on my phone to track my activity and am trying to up it little by little. Light yoga is good for me, too. The fatigue is real. Edited March 5, 2019 at 8:46 pm",
