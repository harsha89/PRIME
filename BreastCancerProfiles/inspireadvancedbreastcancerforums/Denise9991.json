But I found that slathering my hands and feet with Aquaphor at night, and bags on my feet (I did just order silicone socks) and plastic food service gloves on my hands....Keep them from cracking as badly. The advice to wear white socks and white cotton gloves at night doesn't make sense since they absorb the ointment. I am on 2,000 a day, one week on and one week off as a 17+ year survivor of Stage 4 MBC de novo and currently NED.",

Foundation One testing showed that my chest node mets were BRCA2+ Somatic. I would never touch any non-FDA approved supplements since they can negate the efficacy of my chemos. So can CBD oil, depending on the type of BC one has. Also no alcohol for me. Edited March 7, 2019 at 2:55 pm",

      "Content": "I am a 17+ year survivor of Stage 4 MBC de novo. Depending on what chemo I am on, my diet varies. When I have nausea, I need to eat carbs to settle my stomach. While I try to eat a healthy diet, it just isn't always possible. And seriously, diets aren't going to really affect the cancer...chemo is what helps. I don't drink alcohol, take any non-FDA approved supplements (since they can negate the effects of chemo), and don't do CBD or THC. Others disagree, but I credit my longevity to my choices. As far as exercise, I do what I can, but now that I am on Xeloda with sore hands and feet, most exercise is out of the question for me.",

      "Content": "I have been on Xeloda for 14 months. I use Aquaphor all of the time. Had tried Ammonium Lactate, Clobetasol and Urea 40% as prescribed by my onc. But they all dried out my feet and I had a lot of raw areas. Instead of wearing white socks and gloves at night over the Aquaphor, I now use bags on my feet- LOL. But I did order silicone socks from eBay. And I wear plastic food service gloves at night. Because, obviously, the cotton socks and gloves just absorb the ointment. I use Udderly Smooth several times a day on my hands. I am only on 2,000 a day, one week on, one week off, so my nausea isn't bad at all. Take the pills a half hour after a high protein meal or snack. I have used Zofran, but also like OTC Emetrol for nausea.",

My large chest node mets were obliterated in only 8 days with a clinical trial of Poziotinib!! That is why I am now NED. I had bad SE's, so was taken off early. But I hope that they keep researching it.",

      "Content": "The weirdest thing for me, is that exercises really hurt my back. I have done Pilates for years and years, and about 4 years ago, I had the most excruciating pains in my back, to the extent that sometimes I couldn't move for an hour. No doctors could figure out the cause. Finally, after I broke my femur and shoulder in a fall (unrelated to my back pain), lying flat on my back in a nursing home for a month, the back pain went away. About a year ago, I started to exercise again, but only stretches and touching my toes, and the pains started again. Turns out that exercising hurts my back!!! So now I am doing very mild (old-lady type) exercising. Geesh.",
