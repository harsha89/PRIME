Our virtual group welcomes all survivors and their caregivers. We recognize BCa comes in all shapes and sizes.

That group meets every 4th Thursday - next meeting will be on Thursday, Jan 28, 2019 at 6 pm Eastern.

      "Content": "If diagnosed even recently with one of a host of diseases, including breast & prostate cancer and many pulmonary conditions, and you frequented Lower Manhattan/ NW Brooklyn after the WTC collapsed in 2001, you may be entitled to both healthcare assistance and compensation through the 9-11 WTC Healthcare Fund and Victims' Compensation Fund. People who responded &/or lived and worked in Lower Manhattan during and after the Towers collapsed may be entitled to assistance with their medical costs and compensation. Many of these folks were diagnosed several years later and may have moved away, while First Responders visited from all parts of the country. Since only 90,000 claims have been processed and some 450,000 were impacted, a large number remain and many are unaware of their benefits. And many are men living with prostate cancer - unless their medical team were sharp enough to pick it up in the intake, they would never know their rights.

      "Content": "Speaking Freely Virtual Support Group - Thursday, May 16 @ 8 pm Eastern; 7 pm Central; 6 pm Mountain; 5 pm Pacific; 2 pm Hawaii Discuss all the non-medical aspects of living with cancer ... join us tonight! Speaking Freely is a support group for men with cancer, any cancer. It is a place for us to talk without being judged. Every man present has cancer ... you'll be among friends. We help each other and in doing so, we help ourselves. You have Cancer. Not the little \"c\"ancer like a magazine article. You have the big \"C\"ancer. The difference? Its now personal - you own cancer. Doctors, nurses, physicians assistants, lab techs and a host of other medical professionals will help with the medical side, the technical side of dealing with the seemingly unending events that you have been thrust into ..... they will explain the terms and test and results. They don't help much with the rest of your life ...... the unknown, the emotional roller coaster we received a front row ticket to ride. The concern about how to provide for your family, the aching fear you won't walk your daughter down the isle. The sense of loss in not feeling well enough to play with your grandson or the unfairness of not being able to play with your son. The embarrassment of incontinence, the shame of ED, the loss of intimacy with your partner. The format is informal, the conversation enlightening and encouraging. Please join us at 8pm EDT on the 3rd Thursday of each month and let your voice support your brothers. JOINING INSTRUCTIONS ONLINE Please join our meeting from your computer, tablet or smartphone. Paste the link below into your browser: https://www.gotomeet.me/AnswerCancer You will be using your microphone and speakers (VoIP). A USB headset is recommended for the best sound quality.
