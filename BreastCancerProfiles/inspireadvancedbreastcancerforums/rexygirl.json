    "Content": "I do walks of 2 miles, but sometimes its hard after being on my feet all day at work. What I really find fun is biking ! It really helps pump the lymph and isn't hard on my feet. I go to a nearby bike trail so I don't have to worry about cars on the road. I have a little rebounder also.",
