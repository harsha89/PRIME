    "Content": "I don't think I would want comprehensive genetics testing--too great a chance for \"mishandling\" of the results. This said, after several sets of iron labs that were high, I had genetic testing for hemochromatosis. I discovered I had a double mutation, so now my relatives know to be tested. It's a pre-existing condition, though. Should my kids have to decide to be tested or not based upon proposed US health care legislation; e.g. do they want the chance of having a \"pre-existing\" condition in their records? Lots of questions around genetic testing.",
