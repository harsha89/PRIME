      "Content": "Help please , I\u2019m in bed all the time , weak legs , and sad . I could deal with the diarrhea but the weakness in limbs is horrible. Did anyone experience this on verzenio together with zomeda infusion or FASLODEX shots . It\u2019s alot of meds . I have stage 4 which spread to ribs only . So scared , help please with advice . My CA15-3 BLOOD TEST RESULT went down to 23 from 59 . The 59 was the reason for the pet scan which light up at rib on one side . Please tell me your experience. I\u2019m so upset and crying all the time . I can\u2019t eat .",

This is all very scary with no other options as we have an incurable but treatable disease . Treatable (hogwash) I just wish we could feel good while treatment which will never end until my end üò© no choices , just carry on . Hoping you are feeling ok and able to get some laughs in sometimes . I watch family feud and funny stuff and I still can laugh. Not yesterday , tears all day . ü•∞",
