      "Content": "From the patient/caregiver perspective, I think the constant stream of new and different people (\"I'm the nurse until 2 today\" \"I'm the respiratory aide specialist\" \"I'm the nutritionist\" \"I'm the hospitalist\") is exhausting. And the longer or more frequently a family is in the hospital, the more exhausting and frustrating that becomes. I saw one hospital that had each person give the patient or family a business card with his or her title and photo. They also provided an album (which was kind of hilarious that an album was needed but also highlights the point of just how many people come through a patient's room) in which the patient could put the card collection. This was helpful to be able to refer back to the cards to know who the person was that said \"X\" earlier in the day. But somehow easing this \"interaction burden\" would be helpful.",
