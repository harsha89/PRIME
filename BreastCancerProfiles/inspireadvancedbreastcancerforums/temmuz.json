    "Content": "Hello Dear ladies. As I use this group as a personal therapy since I have been diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer, I found myself again here. I have been diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer on June 2017, multiple bone and lung metastasis. My onc put me on Kisqali+femara and it was so effective for me. My CEA put from 180 to 60s and it was stable for nearly 6 months. Last month I took my 18th cycle of kisqali and according to blood tests my CEA elevated to 93. We waited for this month's results. So, yesterday CEA was 101. This morning I had a PET scan and I am waiting for the results. I am afraid ladies. Afraid of progression. Everything is going well, I feel myself healthy, my other blood results were perfect but this marker elevation devestated me. And now scanxiety kickes me of. I was doing well on this treatment regiment. I have no idea what am i going to do if it spread to another part of my body. Has anybody experienced something like this? I wish health for all of us, Hugs, temmuz.",
