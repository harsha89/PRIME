    "Content": "Hi, I was diagnosed and cured of throat Cancer last year, and I had 3 sessions of Chemo and 35ish sessions of Radiotherapy, obviously the Chemo helped and was necessary. However, my Girlfriend had Brain cancer in 2014-2015 and was given 13 months to live, we decided that Chemo was initially needed, she had one session and then we decided that another session was too much for her to handle and we thought that the side effects would negatively affect the last remaining months she had. A quick breakdown from my experience is, if you can be cured or progress towards the future have it, if it is a quick and agressive cancer then don't. Just my opinion. Good Luck Liam",
