Am on antibiotics cos infection in wound from wide re exision ( fail again, mastectomy after chemo ) .  Would be really grateful if someone could let me know if these shakes, trembling is normal. Is is something to do with the steroids?  Sorry rambling on, I'll stop now ",

Have to admit feel a bit violated now as not sure who else is reading my posts for their own agendas.  Just wonder if it was me being targeted or if anyone else has been?  Is there anyway to block them from seeing my posts? ",

My hospital would only fit one if I paid privately and there are not that many nurses on the unit who are actually able to use  one. Apparently on the unit this year they have seen about 5 people with ports , and that's a unit who give chemo to 35+ people a day.  I had no idea that it depends on where you live whether you can have the option.  Xx",

      "Content": "Hi . Just wanted to share a salutary lesson and ask advice. Had PICC line fitted week ago weds and first chemo the next day. 5 days after the line was fitted my upper arm started getting sore. It was worse by the weds ( had been in a week then ) so spoke to district nurse who came out to flush it and she said it looks and feels ok, will just be bruising under skin . Saw GP on Thursday about something else but mentioned it . He said it'll just be muscle settling down.  By Friday was agony so rang the chemo unit who said to come right in . Had ultrasound and it was a blood clot. They said one more day would have ended up with whole vein blocked which could be nasty. Anyway now on Warfarin inj  for length of chemo, having PICC out on Monday , and am going to have to have Hickman line. And arm is still agony  Got really told off for not contacting them earlier. So lesson learnt and shared . Next time I have any pain or something that I'm not sure about I'm going to get on phone to them straight away , not just wait and see if it goes off. Hope everyone else does too .  On another point, there is discussion about whether to delay 2nd chemo if I haven't had Hickman line in yet because it's not great to give chemo through cannula? Does anyone know why , and what's not great about it? I'm on FEC.  Thanks for listening ",

      "Content": "Thanks for that . Can I 'insist ' on a port? Sorry to sound stupid but what exactly is it?  I'm feeling so unsure and uneducated about all this at the moment as every turn seems to have gone wrong ( 2 failed ops, 2 horrible infections and now blood clot ) that I seem to have gone from someone who was positive and decisive to this crumbling wreck just being pulled along . Really need to get my big girl pants back on, but seem to have mislaid them !!!   Thanks again,  Sue",

      "Content": "Hi Mazza10. Please don't let my experience put you off. I had a worry about it dangling too but with a light bandage round it the first couple of days and then a proper cover it was fine. A district nurse came weekly to me to flush it so I didn't have to schlep to the hospital every week.  I was unfortunate to have the clot but most people have no problems.  It really is a matter of personal choice I think. I would go along and have a talk with them, then make a decision based on your own instincts.  If you do go with the PICC, you can get nice comfy covers from a company called Feelbetterwith.com. They sell all sorts of stuff to help with cancer and chemo side affects too. Not cheap but I found it worth it for the short time I had it. You can also get a free shower cover prescribed for you or buy one for about £10.  I would take advice then make the decision that feels right for you.  Take care Xxx",
