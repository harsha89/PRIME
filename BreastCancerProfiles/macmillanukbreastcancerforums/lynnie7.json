      "Content": "I had my second round of chemo 11 days ago. I was surprised how upset I was by the thought of losing my hair, when others had gone through it I always thought it was a small price to pay for a cure. Not the same when it\u2019s you! After picking my hair up from everywhere in the house (which was awful),  I had my head shaved and the tingling in my scalp wasn\u2019t as bad, I actually felt a whole lot better for it. . I had a no. 5 but now it\u2019s getting patchy I think I\u2019ll shave it off. Hopefully with a bit of sun on it, it won\u2019t look too bad.  As everyone keeps telling me \u2018it\u2019s only temporary\u2019. Good luck",
