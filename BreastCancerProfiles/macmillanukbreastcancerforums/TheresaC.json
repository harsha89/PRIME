    "Content": "Hi Mudge, I too, like you was diagnosed with ductal invasive breast cancer 18mm in my right breast and had my  lumpectomy and sentinel node biopsy operation on Wednesday 04 December and get the results back on 14 December.  I am also a \"glass half full\" person and am trying to staying positive.  I've received a copy of the letter sent to my GP from my surgeon and for once am happy to hear that the procedure was \"uneventful\", although I know that this is not the end of my journey.   Wishing you and everyone else who is awaiting results all the best of luck. Also thanks to all on this wonderful site.   Theresa x",
