      "Content": "Hi Charlie95, I had the same type of pains after my diagnosis - in my shoulder on the affected side and even into my neck. Like you I was worried, but I needn't have been. It was just tension, the cancer had not spread. I looked forward to my operation as I saw it as the forceful eviction of an unwanted lodger. Have to say it was very effective and all is going well. Hugs and very positive wishes coming your way Lesley x",

      "Content": "Hello Catsrme, I think I know some of how you are feeling. I was recalled after a routine mammogram and spent a couple of hours in the NNUH on the 21st of this month, Another 18 plates were taken then the ultrasound followed by the biopsies. The Radiologist asked if I wanted his opinion, which I did, and I was told it is very likely to be cancer. It has been suggested that I will have a lumpectomy in October, but I will know a lot more when I meet the team, including the surgeon, on the 28th - 44 hours to wait. I am 67 and live 8 miles west of the NNUH near Honingham if you ever want a coffee. Good Luck Lesley x",

      "Content": "Hello Catsrme, Please do not think that my situation puts yours \"into perspective\".  Cancer is a frightening thing to have no matter who we are or what we have been through and you have every right to feel the way you do. The positive side of my situation is that I have already seen the amazing work the cancer teams at the NNUH do. They have some of the best specialist in the UK and they make you feel that you are part of their team, not just a \"patient\". They are with you all they way and will tell you about some wonderful support services available to you - if you haven't heard about them already. That is what has given me so much faith in them and what they can do for us. I hope that after the 31st you will start to feel more confident about the next few weeks and the eviction of the unwanted \"lodger\" in your breast. I am around until 8th September and then back on the 4th August, but will be keeping in touch with the site. Keep positive  Hugs on their way to you Lesley x",
