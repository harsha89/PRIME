      "Content": "After my third EC I got a painful arm especially on straightening my elbow or raising my arm above my head. It is tender to touch but no signs of a blood clot. It is the arm used for the chemo (the lumpectomy and LN sampling was the other side). I understand it is a side effect of epirubicin (the red drug). I wondered if any one had any experience of this arm problem and if so whether they found anything that helped. I am uncertain as to whether physio or even kinesthiology taping would help or hinder.",
