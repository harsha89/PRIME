    "Content": "Hi Ladies, I'm another newcomer to all this, had Lumpectomy and SLNB 2 weeks ago and got my results yesterday. SLN is positive so just been told I need chemo followed by further lymph removal followed by radiotherapy. It all seems very daunting but already finding these discussions very helpful. I was particularly interested in the discussions around private versus NHS as I have private cover via my employer but so far all the advice I've had is to stick with the NHS. The Macmillan centre I attend has been great but now I'm reading that there are possible advantages in private, specifically interested in the portacath as my veins are really bad and they always struggle to get blood etc. is it possible to get this on the NHS? If I decide to use my insurance do I need to make a decision now or can I do it after I've seen my oncologist next week and understand the proposed treatments better?",
