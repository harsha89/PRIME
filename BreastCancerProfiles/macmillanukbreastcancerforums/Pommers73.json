      "Content": " Hi, I\u2019m a complete mess! Yesterday I had a mammogram as a couple of lumps were found in my left breast, it was clear and then had to have an ultrasound which they said was because my Breasts have a few lumpy what they think are fibro lumps/glands? and because the breast tissue is very dense they wanted me to have a biopsy. They said they didn\u2019t think it was anything to worry about at all and were doing it just for a precaution but I just can\u2019t think positively, having to wait is killing me, I\u2019m a complete and utter emotional wreck, my partner keeps saying but it was clear they didn\u2019t see anything it will be fine and they won\u2019t find anything as do my family and friends but I just can\u2019t get my head round it and can\u2019t function one bit. I keep doing the what ifs and maybes and I know I\u2019m making myself sick with worry and bringing everyone down around me.....",
