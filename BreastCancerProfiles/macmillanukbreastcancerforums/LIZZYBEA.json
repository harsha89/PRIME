      "Content": "Mamie I just come on from time to time Like you  i need to get a wee bit of reassurance.  The team and the people here are so nice also don t forget to call a helpline as well where there are trained nurses to talk you through your fears. We all get so carried away and truly there is so much medicine nowadays and advanced treatments. I was diagnosed with BC but after a mamagram and biopsy and step by step waiting to get treatment that was right for me. I had myself in such a state so I know the very worst scenarios we go through I also got blood taken and chest xray they called me in too. So I know what your saying. My BC was in early stages and I had 5 weeks radiation. I was like omg the things I thought I had, rvery pain I had I said tbats it the cancer is there. Sore back it was in my spine! IT was nothing of the sorts   It takestime to be convinced its not in these areas lol! And if your a worrier like me I thought it was everywhere.  Please phone helpline too Mamie, try not to worry. If you can keep us posted here. Im glad I was able to just say a few words that may help you. Xx",

      "Content": "Hi Mamie, Im so very sorry to hear your so upset, things might not be as bad as what you think it will. Try not to go reading into things and speculate. Youve not had a mamagram yet so let the experts talk you through whatever it is you think you have. Its a terrynfying experience I know Ive been there and ive speculated till the cows came home and got it all wrong!  So please dont go looking at the internet or Google truly its no good until the right people talk and examine you. Its lovely you have a good husband, take all the support you can get at the moment and please try not to diagnose yourself. Its not easy but once you  know the true facts then you can have a plan along with experts. In the meantime I pray all will be okay for you do not feel ashamed about a thing, youve nothing to feel ashemed about. Save your energy for YOURSELF and I hope all goes okay on Monday for you. Please if you can keep us posted. God bless you and all might not be what it seems. Xx",
