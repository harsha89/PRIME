      "Content": "Dear Carol I agree with everything Jayne & Tina have said. Can't comment on the vein/ Hikman issue, but can on the hair! I started to lose mine 2 weeks after the 1st FEC session. I had glossy, thick shoulder length hair...but once it started to fall out I initially cut it pretty short & then shaved it off. For me it was a common sense approach - it's going to fall off anyway so why not be a little ahead of the game! I too wear scarves and hats...and have had very complementary comments on the scarves from strangers! They obviously don't know what I'm hiding!!! I know the feeling of \"everyone\" is looking at me...I lost my partner 4 years ago...so don't have someone to give me a honest opinion at any given moment! But I've decided that I look so gorgeous and that's why some people look at me! Vain, I'm sure!! But the biggest thing I feel is you/ we all need to be BE KIND TO OURSELF - do things that feel good...that can be a bath/ downloading a CD/ having a cream cake or anything that your heart really desires! And when you feel down/ low look in a mirror and speak to yourself (loudly if you need to) as you would to a friend. What would you say to friend in a similar position who was feeling down...etc?? Hope that helps Carol. Keep posting when you need to. Hug, Sandie",

      "Content": "Hi all! Just a bit of info for anyone looking for headscarves. I had a few problems trying to find nice, bright cotton ones until I walked into my local Hobbycraft! They sell fabric by the metre and I bought 2 lovely ones (a metre each) for the princely sum of £3.98!! Prices range from 99p to around £10 a metre! I bought one with daisies on it - with the thought that my hair will grow back as beautiful as the daisies!! Cheers! Sandie",
