      "Content": "Tell your nurse - she should say what you should/should not do.  And tell the Spa - a good one will make you sign a disclaimer (this proves they know their stuff).   I was treated in France,  acknowledged as best at treating cancer, and had an aromatherapy massage EVERY DAY.  It does wonders for your skin,. Also have a facial massage because your skin will be dried out by drugs.  There is anecdotal evidence that Reflexology is good for you - I had it and found it beneficial. Have fun!",

      "Content": "What about going to see a good surgeon privately for a consultation first?  Since the NHS has got itself into such a pickle I have found consultants to be incredibly helpful.  They give you honest opinions, will be able to discuss pros and cons, and if they also work in the NHS can tell you how long you will have to wait.  Re another problem, I knew I should see my NHS consultant about this, but was told he didn't have an appointment slot available.  So I saw him privately (one week's wait at my convenience) and he greeted me with \"there won't be any charge for this consultation as you shouldn't have been mucked about by the NHS\".  Darling man!",
