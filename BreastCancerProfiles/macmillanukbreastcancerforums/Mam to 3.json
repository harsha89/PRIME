      "Content": "I\u2019ve been officially diagnosed with invasive ductal breast cancer. There is also cancer in my nodes.  The biopsy results show that it\u2019s ER+, they\u2019re still waiting for the results of the HER2 test.  I needed a CT scan to check if it\u2019s spread or not, there was a cancellation so I had that at 3:20pm this afternoon.  I\u2019ll be having surgery, chemo and radiotherapy, but the order/type of treatment depends on the remaining test results which hopefully I\u2019ll find out next Wednesday.",

      "Content": "@ask123 my consultant has said that they will put a temporary implant in after the mastectomy and will do the final reconstruction after the radiotherapy is finished, so probably about a year down the line. I\u2019m just going along with their advice, they\u2019re the experts so I need to trust that they\u2019re doing the best thing. I\u2019m only 37 (almost 38) so need to make sure that whatever is done is the best thing long term. ",

      "Content": "Thanks for the replies. I\u2019ve been told that I\u2019ll be having a mastectomy, chemo and radiotherapy.  The type of chemo, the order of the treatment and whether I\u2019ll have medication before the mastectomy all depends on the HER2 test as Mirabo says. I\u2019d hoped to know the plan today but in hindsight I was a little naive. Next Wednesday I should know more. ",

My oncologist only mentioned the cold cap briefly and the nurses haven\u2019t mentioned it at all.  I bought a couple of wigs from a lovely wig shop in Newcastle. Not sure if I\u2019ll wear them yet as my head is already irritable but we\u2019ll see. ",

When I had my pre-assessment the nurse said that because I\u2019d had bad morning sickness and have 3 young children she\u2019ll give me more than just the standard anti sickness meds from the start. Did you have to give yourself fail injections for 7 days after each chemo to help with white blood cell counts? I will which is fine but just wondering if you have any tips? Thanks x",
