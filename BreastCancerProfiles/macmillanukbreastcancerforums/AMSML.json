      "Content": "Hi there. I had 14 nodes removed, chemo, rads, Tamoxifen and am now on anastrozole. Ever since surgery I have had lymphodema of my breast an chest wall. A supportive bra helps, some days it is better than others, more often than not it is an indication of if I've been overdoing it!!!! I have of course run it past the docs and had every test in the book but I'm four years out and clear and enjoying life so figure it is a minor bother. Keep on at the docs and support team until your mind is set at ease, rest when you can and keep looking for he fun in life.",

      "Content": "Hi Kittycat, I am with you!  I am so fed up of people asking me about the state of my mind I want to give them a piece of it!!    I really am fed up with the whole doctor thing and would gladly never see another one or the inside of another hospital ever again but I am not crazy and will see the GP after this weekend because a) the pain won't go away b) it is in the liver zone c) the pesky thing I had in the first place grew very fast and d) my head is driving me nuts so maybe I do need my mind put at ease!! :-) I don't think I need counselling though, tried that and the counsellor basically kindly laughed me out of the room saying I was in jolly good shape and just fatigued.  You know if you tell your Gp you are fatigued they get you to fill in a form to see if you are depressed and it asks if you have trouble sleeping!  A hot flush every hour and fifteen minutes will do that!  I am so not depressed, I'm loving my life, I have a life! If I had more energy I would have even more of a life. I got through chemo, rads and herceptin great too.  The late effects  and the niggles seem to be the harder part for me because I hate being a fuss pot and want to be \"normal\" again or even find that new normal that is mentioned at times.  If this is it though I'm miffed.  The Queen has more energy than me and she is 36 years older than me - NO - I am hanging out there for more recovery and repair and restoration and will continue to have a blast and enjoy every moment just as soon as i have got this pesky pain checked out. I used to be a nurse and I was trained to understand that \"pain is what the patient feels\" and that we should pay attention.  So now is the time to take my own advice and not take no or some nonsense like you have had to face for an answer.   I feel a cheer leaders chant coming on, GO, GO, NEED TO KNOW!",

      "Content": "I love checking in here every now and again and even being able to share what I hope is an odd word of encouragement having been there, got the bandana, and had the hair grow back!  But every now and then it helps to know you guys are there to go to even though I'm not a newbie.   I'm four years out from WLE, chemo, rads, herceptin, tamoxifen and now on anestrozole.  In November I had a head, chest and abdominal CT because I was extremely fatigued and a couple of blood tests were a bit off but, Hallelulia, everything came back NORMAL - TA DAH!  Loud cheers around the room.  So, I've surged forward - ok - gently eased forward at a snail's pace is probably more like it into a new job and was getting used to improving slowly...........  Until now!  Now I have a new pain.  Not the usual rib pain but a new pain under my ribs and if it goes on I will have to see the doctor - BOTHER!!  And I'm in a whole other part of the country, across the water so I cannot see my regular folk - BOTHER!!  and maybe if the scans were all normal just 5 months ago i have in fact just pulled a muscle but I know better than to ignore things - BOTHER!! RATS, RATS, DOUBLE RATS AND A BOTHER!!!!!!!!! I will not be beaten by the elephant in the room.  I can normally keep it tiny and key ring size but if I'm honest the anxiety of not knowing what the problem is has let the elephant get big and take up half the carpet so I can't even see the telly and take my mind off it. So there you have it. I have a new pain and it has set me off on the speedy journey to worryville taking in the sights of anxiety town out of control city along the way.   Actually just talking it out here in this safe space helps to ignore the pesky preset satnav in my head and turn round and find my own way back to sanity.   Thanks for listening folks.",

      "Content": "When I had my op one of the wonderful nurses explained something that I think might be helpful. They told me that from whenever you find the lump or get the diagnosis until you have the operation to have the rebellious cells removed your adrenalin levels tend to run a bit high because it is all such a rush with so much to take in. After the op it takes about three days and then there is the feeling of a bit of a crash like after a big event you have been building up to for a while or doing an exam. It is the adrenaline levelling out. Add that to anaesthetics taking time to come out of your system and the general rule of thumb is to take things very gently for a while. It will pass, things will get better. I am sure you will be such a blessing to you wife. Encourage her to listen to her body and go with the flow and if she gets too worried to contact her gp or breast care nurse.",

So glad there is nothing sinister on your scan and xray.  I'm wondering if physio or massage might help on the pain front but I'm also with your doc and friend on the pain killer front!   Clinic appointment due next Tuesday and super busy spell of work and holiday planning between now and then so no time to dwell too much.

      "Content": "Hi folks, Well I have tried not to let it get on top of me but I'm sat here hurting and very scared. My back between my shoulder blades really hurts, it is so sore at night it wakes me, pain killers are not helping and it has taken ages to get the GP to help. I did the two week wait thing only to be told it was probably postural, two more visits later and after having to fight past an untrue report from a physio about a completely unrelated issue, thank goodness, I finally have an X-Ray tomorrow and I have been referred to see an onc. (I am not on home territory or I would have talked to the old team, everything is so much harder here) I'm 5yrs out from stage 3b er+ her2+++ wle, Anc, chemo, rads, herceptin, tamoxifen and now on anastrozole. It could just be side effects of anastrozole but I've been on that over a year, and as I had to say to the GP again and again this is a new pain. My problem is I hate not knowing what the problem is. The doc said, well your calcium is alright ( the sample was taken 6 months ago), the bone scan was clear (also done six months ago for a completely different pain). Can things change in six months? Yes Do bones scans show all problems? No they don't - they miss some types of lesion, tiny ones for instance? Would the doc hear that? No! Am I allowed to be paranoid for a moment? Right at the start of this whole \"life experience\" I had a mamo for a suspect area in the April and was seen by a consultant - nothing was seen of felt. In august I found the lump and by October it was 3+cm and in the lymph nodes. Aggressive little blighter! I had felt tired all the time and had a slightly sore throat and had blood tests which were all perfect. Now here I am again, same symptoms, perfect blood tests and a big b*********y question in my mind. Is this just arthritis or is it back? I know I've got pain-xiety, x-ray-xiety, paranoia and all the rest but it is hard sometimes when you're on your own. Thanks for being there, for being safe. Amsml",

      "Content": "Hi HilaryAnne, As one of your other ladies has said, no one can tell you what to do but we can share our thoughts and experiences.   I wondered if you have figured out what your biggest concerns are about chemo?  Is it about the side effects at the time, the longer term effects.  I don't know but I think there is a rightness in asking all the questions you can possibly think of to find the answer you did not know you were looking for.  So go for it. Ask and ask.   But I also know I drove myself nuts going round and round in circles with stats and possibilities when for me I finally woke up one morning having \"smelt some kind of coffee\" and realised what I wanted was to live and beat the thing that had rebelled in me so it became a sort of \"life vs side/late effects\" choice and I'm up for life every time. I had a 3cm stage 3 ER+ PR+ HER2+ lymph node + with clear margins on lumpectomy.  Had FEC-T herceptin, rads, tamoxifen and so on. I've written this before elsewhere but i saw the cancer cells as a terrorist cell that had unfortunately managed to send out suicide bombers and I was not up for them forming sleeper cels anywhere in my body so I wanted the SAS, CIA and any other tactical unit I could get going in there to rout them. Knowing these guys were not likely to be precision operatives I figured there would be some collateral damage but they were at least on my side.   I'm four years out and doing just fine.  I think every one responds in their own way.  I get a bit tired now and then but I work full time and some so it could be down to that.   Hope you find a settled place on this soon.  All the best, Amsml",

      "Content": "Hi Sue, Well, I did not get a 'Mallen Streak' but I have developed a 'hairline halo'.  I was 45 when diagnosed with about two grey hairs that I would remove when they dared show themselves and after chemo my hair came back more coarse with a bit of a kink (I was hoping for curly!) and with more colour than it had before but then on the tamoxifen I seemed to go rapidly grey round the edges!!  Of course it could just be age as I am heading for the five years but it did seem to go fast - maybe it's the stress, maybe it's the hormones, may be it was the Tamoxifen - I don't know. I think this stuff is just one big wierdness and deserving of any emotion that needs expressing in any way my body finds an out!  Odd eh? Was going travelling at the weekend but went nowhere instead - the airport was closed so stayed warm and snuggled up, bliss. Amsml x",
