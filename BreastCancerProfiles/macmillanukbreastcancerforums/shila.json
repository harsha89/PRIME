    "Content": "Hi I have taken Anastrazole now for a year.  I also get really itchy on the back and sometimes on the stomach.  The prickly itch is due to peripheral neuropathy normally from the chemotherapy. Otherwise no really bad side effects. This happens when I get stressed or too hot walking. It\u2019s horrid but I am still going to carry on taking it. Is yours better now? If so what did you get to help. Sheila x",
