      "Content": "Hi Blue Tit Yes i had Mr Mackey and I think he did an amazing job. I have been posting on the Breast Cancer Care website almost like a daily blog with all the little steps(major to me) at the time. My surgery was on Wednesday 15th May and I came out on the Saturday. I had had some leaking from my tummy scar which wasn't a problem but required daily changes of dressing. There was a slight redness on my newly reconstructed boob which did not respond to antibiotics so as a precautionary measure they admitted me again to give me antibiotics intravenously (2 weeks after initial discharge). I have now been here 3 days and as i mentioned a little area of tenderness in my boob they asked if they could drain off a little fluid to send for analysis so they could use the right antibiotics to clear it. When they drained the area they realised that there was quite a collection of fluid (80ml) which was obviously infected so i am scheduled for a brief trip to theatre today to give it a bit of a clean out My initial surgery was just under 11 hours but i was up in a chair on day one (just), was walking to the loo on day 2, and progressed daily from there on. I would say that i was 95% able to walk normally and get up and down by 2 weeks after discharge. I feel really well in myself so didn't think the boob redness was anything major but jolly glad i erred on the side of caution and came back in. My posts on the BCC sight go into daily detail and might be of benefit if you are waiting to go through the same procedure and i would be more than happy for you to pm me I would say - the staff at the QVH East Grinstead are brilliant - you will be in great hands!
