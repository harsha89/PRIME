A friend who I met at hospital had 6 her tumour did not change in size after 4 by the 6th it was same size so she wished she'd just had the 4. I think it depends on the type you have it maybe an idea to take all the paperwork and findings you have to yr onc and discuss further. That's what I did and he agreed only 4.

Leaving argon oil on all night is also good massage into scalp and brush thru and shampoo off in morning.  Remember if follicles are not damaged yr hair won't fall out regardless of what you do I used mousse blow dried it etc and it was fine.  It does dry out (hence argon oil) but it's well worth it I lost little or no hair it was just strands I lost if u want more info private message me and I can go into it further I will add u as a friend  Hang in there xxx",

You have to look at quality of life too my onc agreed and said we cld be over prescribing you and it won't come back and u didn't actually need it !! Not much help but it was enough for me to decide on an alternative route.

      "Content": "Hi Sara  I did cold cap & lost little hair no more than u normally wld.  If u read my previous posts you will see the main thing is ITS TIGHT TOUCHES THE ENTIRE SCALP. Take a paracetamol an hr b4 of during it you feel u need another ask nurses. The 1st 10 mins is very cold but very bearable & after that it's ok.  As its tight (make sure strap under chin is also tight) the pressure can build & u may get a headache but other than that it's fine. If yr on fec its to stay on 90 mins after chemo ends but I would say it's 100% worth it if u want to private message me for more detailed tips I'll give u my number.  Please don't apologise for jumping in that's what we're here for & I'm more than happy to help ❤️ Lots of love Lynn xxx",

      "Content": "Hi hetty50 Omg !! I am shocked of course it makes a difference The reason it's thinning on yr crown is because the cap is not touching it properly it needs to be TIGHT the ties on cap have to be pulled tight and the chin strap also there can't b air on top of cap at the crown.  It makes me so mad that lots of women go through this it's totally &  utterly unnecessary.  What chemo are you away to get fec or T or other ?  On the Paxman machine there shld be a laminated time guide re what chemo = what times it's to be on m.  The reason it's kept on after chemo is to ensure it's kept cold while chemo dissipates away from the scalp message me if you want more info  Lots of love Lynn xxxx",

      "Content": "Susien Also it's 30 mins b4 chemo & 90 mins after for fec & 30 mins after for T YOU MUST KERP IT ON FOR THS ALLOTED TIME OR IT WILL NOT WORK. I blow dried my hair I put mousse on it the only thing I did different was cut down on washing it to twice a week. I found a wet brush (amazon £5) was best purchase it doesn't pull yr hair wet or dry.  The best bit of advice I was given was from a top Scottish hairdresser who has dealt with wigs & chemo patients for over 40 yrs if the hair follicles are not damaged it won't fall out so you can treat it like yr hair.  If they are damaged it will fall out.  As I said I lost little or no more hair than you would in normal shedding &  mine is long. So before you go rash think about it because if it does thin you have the length to tie it up & it will still look tidy you get it cut short that's it if it's a mess yr snookered ❤️ Private message me if you want a proper chat  Love Lynn xxx",

It's all very well them saying it's not a guarantee.... no their right if it's not fitted properly   Lots of love Lynn xxxx",

By the time I got near the end I got an itchy rash I took antihistamine and within 20 mins itch gone so if u experience that take one a day works a treat. The R1 R2 are great and worked well for me (apart from my purse) I used to lie on the bed with my gel on for 20 mins and get the iPad out and shop lol  Good luck with it it is tiring going up every day but funnily enough it does pass relatively quickly Lynn ❤ xxx",
