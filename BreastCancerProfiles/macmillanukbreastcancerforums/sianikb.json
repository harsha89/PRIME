If I had a quid for every time a someone said to me \"oh your looking really well\" I would be rich.How does a cancer patient look like,are we given a picture telling us we should look like Gollum and every time some hair falls out we scream \" my precious\". I lost a lot of friends when I was diagnosed but they can all take a long walk off a short pier. How are you all girls I mean really,not the I'm ok mask. I mean the one we let fall in front of others like us? I'm angry,sad,depressed,tired and just want it over now. Plz girls feel free to friend add me,I'm a great listener.

For the past 17mth its been hospital's,scans,bloods,treatments,oncologists,cardiologists and surgeons. I could walk around my hospital blindfolded and find the right rooms needed. I am so fed up of it cos its taken over my life and I know nothing will ever be the same again and on top of that I have fibromyalgia and M.E. and also disabled due to a stroke in 2009. My life fe has been nothing but c**p since 2009 with illness and now breast cancer. Its so hard holding everything together,getting up in the morning and acting like all is ok.

Anyway back to what I wanted to ask. Yes sorry I blabber ;) Anyway yesterday I got my results and they were clear. I'm still having treatment, I have had fec,radiotherapy and now Herceptin. After I got my results I felt nothing. Do any of you know why I felt nothing? I told people the results and they were pleased for me and stuff,but I still felt nothing and don't feel anything now,shouldn't I be jumping for joy or something? I have to go back every six months then have a mammogram every twelve months for the next 7 years. But I still don't know how I'm going to feel every time they tell me something.

Because my breast cancer was so deep my surgeon told me when he opened me up,he had to cut down as far as my back to remove the \"Nasty\". Now I am left in pain and agony under the bottom of my shoulder exactly opposite my scar, so yay me along with all my other illnesses I now have this stupid inner pain to deal with. I had lymph nodes removed and along with a stroke I had I still don't have full strength in my right arm and quite a few times have gone to lift my arm and got it stuck or pulled my back. Chemo messed up my eating, I still can't stomach certain foods, radiotherapy has left a shadow on my lung, and I'm still waiting to see what side effects come out after having Herceptin. Sometimes I think it would have been easier to let the cancer take me. My husband even said to me the other day \" Your not ill, cos your not in bed\". I could have punched him. Apart from breast cancer I have Fibromyalgia and Myalgia Encephalomyelitis, partially sighted in my left eye and have a left side disability both from my stroke, but I'm not ill. We have had blazing rows twice in the last two weeks, he has told me I don't do anything, hang on when I do stuff he is forever telling me to take it easy cos he doesn't want me to get tired. Keeps telling me he does everything for me (again hang on he my full time carer) and that if he left I wouldn't be able to cope. I love him but sometimes I wish he would just f*** off and leave,cos it would be less stress. He spits his dummy out at the slightest thing its like rearing a child again. I can't win I sometimes wish the cancer had taken me, cos sometimes I can't bear to be alive. I'm fed up of fighting for my life and being accused of being lazy.

You will be told all of this when you start chemo if not don't be afraid to ask. You might get a sore mouth during chemo,so a good mouthwash and a soft toothbrush i.e a baby's one is good ask in the cancer unit for mouthwash they will usually supply it,make sure you have plenty of immodium which again is usually supplied. For my sore mouth I bought this of pineapple drained them,froze them then sucked on them. There is some enzyme in pineapple that is good for chemo mouth. You will also get chemo brain, which will make you forget some things and you will feel like you have a muzzy head. Don't worry about it. Don't drink bottled water as something in that can affect the chemo. Creams any aqueous cream is good for the sunburn effect you get from radiotherapy. Flu jabs are not given to anyone having treatment for cancer. Don't use deodorant or scented soap. Never heard of black nail varnish. The only other thing you can do is listen to your body as it will tell you when you need to rest. Rest as much as you can as chemo will take it out of you even stay in bed all day or for as long as you want,don't be ashamed to. During chemo keep away from anybody who is unwell in anyway even a simple cold could put you in hospital. But most of all Good luck xxxxx¬†",
