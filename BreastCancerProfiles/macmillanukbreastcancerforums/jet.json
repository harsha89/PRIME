Nurses were absolutely fabulous and reassuring. Felt a little bit sick yesterday eve but they said I could take my sleeping tablet which helped as I did get about 4 hours good sleep. Home now and just chilling out and feeling less and less unwell already......... but just waiting to see what other side effects are coming. Thanks for the support and have a good weekend. Jet x",

My breast had actually ached for a few weeks and seemed to moreso after an exercise class - it was this that made me carry out a more thorough self examination. The shock of actually finding a lump was tremendous. I saw my GP on 25th March, referred to Breast Clinic on 28th March where I had a mammogram, ultrascan and core biopsy and my consultant warned me from the initial results that it was a cancerous lump. Turned out I had a 37mm Grade 3 medullary type cancer but no node involvement. I am 53 and I had had a clear mammogram 18 months ago. No history of any cancer at all in the family. Had lumpectomy in April and started 1st session of 6 FEC chemo on 14th May. 20 rad treatments to follow + herceptin + tamoxifan.",

Decided to take wig on hols - I can wear a hat during the day and just slap on the wig for the evening without having to faff about trying to get my hair to look presentable!!  I am going to have a fab holiday and live for today.

Tess - hope your first day back to work went okay?  I was really nervous about going back after 4 months off  last year......like being the new girl again (and I have worked for the company for 20 years!) although there were quite a few people who hadn't even realised I had been off for more than 2 weeks (including the car park attendant)!!.  Of course taking your clothes off might help any promotion or appraisals....?! Mossies love me (got bites the size of plums in Boreno a couple of years ago + had to see the doctor every day and  stay out of the water)  so took double strength jungle gel for Sri Lanka + Dr prescribed some antibiotics in case I got any bites that became infected again.   But was fine - perhaps the chemo is still in the system and not attractive to the little blighters!!

      "Content": "Hi Sally The shampoo is Philip Kingsley no scent no colour and suitable for hair whilst having chemo as it is very gentle. There is also a conditioner. My hairdresser uses his brand in his salon but I ordered it and the conditioner via the internet. My hair is shoulder length and fine so I haven't tried to style it at all. I found wearing a sleep hairnet a night helped (so attractive!), and a thinner one with a hairband during the day, keep stray hairs at bay. Although my hair is growing it is still shedding but much much less. Hope this helps. Jet xx",

      "Content": "I thought I might add my commets re cold cap. I am having 6 x FEC and my last one is next week. I have done the cold cap. Started losing hair at day 19 after first session and although it has thinned and is very fragile (I have fine hair) and I had some bald areas - I guess I have lost 30% volume I have washed my hair just once a week and used Philip Kingsley chemo shampoo and dead sea serum conditioner. I have tried to mitigate any stress to the hair and have not styled it at all - I have just afro combed it once a day and at home I wear an adjustable hairband that can cover more or less as you want, and when I go out I just push it under a wig (have even had compliments about how good my hair looks!) But the good news is that IT HAS ALREADY STARTED TO GROW AGAIN. So ladies - It is definitely worth perserving with. Good luck to you all.",

      "Content": "Hi Noj I am also on Herceptin. Started on  24th Sept but have never heard of Mugga scan.  I  saw the cardiologist to have an echo sound to check my heart before I started and thereafter every 3 months but it is just like a scan when you are pregnant - only around your heart.   I haven't been weighed at all or had any injection prior to the scan and it took max 20 mins.  I also see my Onc every 3 months.  No side effects from the Herceptin except a very runny nose.  I have my blood checked each time and the treatment time is just over the hour with the flushing out.  Also on Tamoxifan for 5 years.
