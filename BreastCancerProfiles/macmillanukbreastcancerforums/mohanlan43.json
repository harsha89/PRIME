      "Content": "Hi Suzyjane,  I had the self same op in 2002, however had had breast cancer in both breasts 1990 without having surgery ,but had chemo plus radiotherapy, it then returned in 2002 as i say, so had to have the op .  I was also on tamoxifen from day 1. The only thing i do regret is that i could have had just one breast removed but because i'd had it in both before,  i decided to have the double mastectomy , i should have listened to my surgeon and not had both.  reason being i am still having bad pain where my back scar tissue is , so having to still taking pain killers,  this does not happen to everyone so please don't  be alarmed by this . Its a shame you cant talk to your family about this, tho i did'nt tell my mum for 6 months, i was also a single mum, however, i did have great girlfriends who supported me through it all.  I think like most men , they tend 2 bury their head in the sand, ( its not really happening ) you could also do what i did and join a support group which helped me a lot. I wish you all the best Suzyjane, if you have time ,you can read My Story, i wrote it last year and it went in all the national papers, i  put it on this site just really to let other women be  beware.  So having had it now 3 times over 25 years , but still here to tell the tale. Take care and good luck bosom buddy x",
