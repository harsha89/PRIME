      "Content": "Helll ladies.  I had my third zap today and my breast has been feeling hot, prickly and itchy since.  I still have pain from the lumpectomy and this additional discomfort is driving me nuts.  I\u2019m using an ice pack now against the breast and in the armpit and it\u2019s bliss!  But it suddenly occurred to me this may be one of those things we mustn\u2019t do! I will ask the radiographer tomorrow, but wondered in the meantime if anyone here knows? thanks",

      "Content": "Thank you, MoomC, Israel & xJukiex. i asked the radiographer and she was kind of uncommittal, as though no one had asked this question before.  Weird.   Anyway, she didn\u2019t say no, she just suggested putting the E45 cream in the fridge and trying an antihistamine. I tried that but it\u2019s nowhere near as good as using an ice pack. i spent some time looking for an Aloe Vera gel that is clear in colour and has fewer chemicals, and I thought it was also fragrance free, but on trying some on my hand today, found it was scented.  Grrrrr. Anyway, not really sure what to do now about the ice. Thanks for your help ladies, I will probably hold off using ice unless the discomfort becomes unbearable!  I did take a Piriton when I got home today and things do feel a little less uncomfortable than yesterday.",
