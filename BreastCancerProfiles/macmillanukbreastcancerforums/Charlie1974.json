      "Content": "Thank you for taking the time to reply. You are all so lovely on here.  Ì know I'm jumping the gun with all these questions etc....i think in my head, if I get organised and accept everything that is going to happen, then if/when I hear the news next week I can absorb all the information that will be given, quickly and calmly & make decisions in a quick timely manner so I don't delay any treatment faffing about!  Obviously I'm hoping they will say it's nothing...but the way things have been worded so far...its definately something. .  Preparing for the worst then any better news will be a bonus.  Thanks again....this weekend is going to feel spook long.

I received a letter from the consultant yesterday..all the usual history, what happened etc.. one if the last sentences was \"if the biopsies show malignancy then it will inflammatory in nature\". I was doing ok but seeing what I had self diagnosed in black and white potentially being right sent me back to the sick feeling again.  My partner is being amazing, we both bad separate wobbles at the weekend, as his wife died of breast cancer, & he was starting to relive the scenario...but we are good to go now...rhank you for your advice & information...id rather be equipped for the worse case anything else is a bonus.

We're getting through it one day at a time but it's so hard for him not to compare...he is so worried for me because he only knows of the bad outcome. I really feel for him, to have i go through jt twice is just crap..and so incredibly unfair. xxx",

I just want to know how fast you get treatment and how to cope with a mastectomy. I've tried to get that in my head but u would imagine that's one if the harder bits to deal with (May be not feeling womanly) I know its not the be all and end all... but I'm sure I'm not the only one to be anxious about it!!

It was the not knowing anything I struggled with. My first post on here was straight after the biopsies were taken and I was in major shock. My partner lost his wife to breast cancer at age 31, so it is a difficult position to be in as he has been here before...he is going to be comparing every comment to that time. In a way i think that is helping me to be more positive as I'm protecting him from the hurt...it my be different after the results...but I know he will be there when he is needed most. Xxx",

Thank you for taking the time to tell me your journey, I have read that it is a rare aggressive cancer so it is reassuring to speak to someone else that has got it & fighting it. I know at the moment I am self diagnosing (but there hasn't been a box left unticked on the list of symptoms) but to know I'm not alone what ever the outcome is a wonderful reassuring feeling.
