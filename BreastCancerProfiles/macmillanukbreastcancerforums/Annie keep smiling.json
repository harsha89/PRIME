      "Content": "Hi Fissi, Sorry to hear about the possible chemo. You'll get lots of advice and support from everyone on here and I hope your holiday gives you that added boost to face the next stage of your treatment.  I have 2nd WLE on 11th June so allowing for recovery it's looking certain that I can't fit rads in before holiday in mid-August, unless I'm wheeled from hospital to airport with major fatigue !!  The surgeon wouldn't be drawn on the subject - but I asked the BCN what my options would be and she said to see how I recovered from surgery, wait until I see the onc, see what dates I'm offered for rads and if it's very near to the holiday dates the onc may allow a short delay - as I've had it confirmed that it's not invasive. And face rads, after our break. But if onc won't delay, the holiday will have to go on hold and we'll rebook. We haven't taken out trav ins yet (well done that you have, it should help you). Will face all that when the time comes. If we lose out on accom costs and deposits, I'm feeling calm because it was so good to hear the words 'not invasive'. If I get away with 2 surgeries and radiotherapy, I WILL count myself as one of the lucky ones. And to all my friends who are approaching 50 and who get the mammo letter in the post, I'll be frog marching them to their appointments.  My DCIS was the size of a fingernail and I could never have known it was there without the mammo. It actually scares me more to think I might have flung that letter in the bin - busy Mum, working full time, will do that later etc.... Still some way to go, but the prospects look good for me.  And for you too Fissi, so just keep going. Good luck to everyone out there - wishing you determination and smiles Special hugs to Sazzieann - hope you're not too sore and miserable after today. Take care Annie xxx",

      "Content": "Hi, not sure if I'll be any help.  I'm DCIS due 2nd WLE soon and then radiotherapy.  As radio won't start until the WLE is healed (3 - 4 weeks minimum seems to be what most people report on here)  I too won't manage to fit in 3 wks radio before my holiday in August. I'll find out more next week - due to see my surgeon on 29th, and intend to check the possible timeline with him - and whether I could delay starting radio for a couple of weeks, starting it after my hol.  I do remind myself of the priority here, as I'm sure the surgeon and oncologist will too (I've prepared myself for that lecture !).  Once, I've sorted out getting completely well, there will be many more trips for me and my family. But I'll ask the question anyway and let you know the response - it might save you some embarrassment !!  If I'm able to have my holiday, the next hurdle will be travel insurance and it seems this is a barrel of laughs if you're having treatment.  Let me know if you have any insurance tips when you get to that point. Good luck, hoping it all works out well for you and you get your much needed break. Will keep in touch Annie xx",

      "Content": "Hello Ggrape6vine,  So sorry you've had to join us here. Yes you'll feel scared.  You're in good company on this site.  We're all here to support eachother and you'll find we're very good at it.  The next few days will be a bit of a blur, but keep reading the posts that seem to be near to your diagnosis and slowly you'll arm yourself with information to help you through.  Think of it in small steps.  I have a different treatment route to you, so can't offer you any immediate tips.  When I have my radiotherapy I'll happily share my experiences if that's useful to you. If someone had told me in March, that I'd have 2 breast surgeries within 5 weeks, have my 50th pretty ruined and manage to carry on regardless, still facing rads to come, I wouldn't have believed them.  But the thing is, what you don't know right now is how strong you're going to be.  You can do this.  We will help you. Take it gently, slowly, calmly.  Love and hugs Annie xxx  ",
