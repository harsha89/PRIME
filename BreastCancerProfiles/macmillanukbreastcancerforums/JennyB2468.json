      "Content": "Thanks SJ for your reply. I like lemongreen tea so will up that and try the apples and flaxseed. I also have heard lots about the manuka honey. There does seem to be a lot of conflicting info on this but may well try. My worry is the flavour. Is it like liquorice? Which one do you use? So many to choose? I wish you well on your journey. Thanks",

I don't drink alcohol and trying to drink loads. Is there anything else you can do to help poor old liver cope with treatment?",

      "Content": "I started radiotherapy on left breast on Wednesday and have been using Aveeno cream twice a day prior and during. As I have a pico dressing on the other breast I am having to avoid showers and wash at the sink. I have been using Aveeno baby wash and gently using flannel to remove soap. Today (day 4 Saturday) on day off, I didn't wash first thing and by lunchtime I noticed when I touched my skin it felt like small bits of skin/cream coming off. I washed gently but it was like a layer was coming off and scared me a little. Have now dried and 're creamed and just airing without anything on. I have an implants following bilateral mastectomy and so worried about contracture and skin braking down. Any one out there with similar? Tx",

      "Content": "Feeling totally gutted. Not only having to deal with breast cancer and the treatment but now have a bladder prolapse. Oncologist thinks it may be related to the hormone treatment and now lack of oestrogen in the system but the bladder was already weakening over the last 18 months. I suppose with the lack of excercise the last few months and the treament its just pushed things along. Wondered if anybody else had been through similar. I am waiting for the gaenacology appointment to be assessed and whether pessaries will be suitable for the time being as surgery is obviously out of the question at the moment - only aged 44 ! Any help/advise greatly appreciated. Thanks",
