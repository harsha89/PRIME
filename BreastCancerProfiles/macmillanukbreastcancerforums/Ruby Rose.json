      "Content": "Hi juley 68 i has 5 Dosetaxel ( didn\u2019t manage the 6th) I found going for a walk helped . On days I felt yucky I was much better going out somewhere a run in the car ( with hubby or a friend as I stopped driving while on chemo as with chemo I got floaty head now and again ) with a wee walk and a cup of tea somewhere . Keep on top of pain by taking paracetamol as packet says , take first half an hour before you get up. It wasn\u2019t too bad .  You MIGHT experience other side effects but we will not go into them for now and don\u2019t go looking for them !  After 3rd Dosetaxel I was admitted to hospital with a high temp and no immunity! But I was having a great day and feeling on top of the world !!!  Even had a wee glass of wine with dinner then later got shivery and noticed my face was red ! Yip I had a temp . So watch your temperature, I was told Dosetaxel is a very good chemo but strong !   Only my 5th Dosetaxel caused me any real problem .  Read my profile .  Plus dontvself medicate - tell your chemo team EVERY if any  problem you have . Don\u2019t mess about , if you need laxatives , they will give you the best , same with mouth wash etc  Hope all goes well and let your friends be good to you and take you out x Ruby Rose xx",

      "Content": "Hi fannygash personally I wouldn\u2019t go abroad . Infact during chemo I only travelled an hour an a half circumference of hospital ( that\u2019s how far I live from hospital ) . We went to some lovely hotels etc , but I know Hotels aren\u2019t always recommended while in Chemo due to contacting germs from others . Infact I was told to avoid small compact areas and chose large airy garden centres to meet friends for coffee .  I don\u2019t think you would enjoy your holiday - it\u2019s not the same , we jumped on a plane before my mastectomy, just to get away from IT ALL !! Ok it was nice but the worry and concerns follow you , ok we had time to ourselves and shed tears but we could have done that nearer home . A luxury caravan / lodge for instance. Without the worry of what if I get ill ?, when will I be fit to travel home ?  I was admitted after  chemo 2 or 3 ( can\u2019t remember now !) I felt great , looked great but I had a high temperature and was out in isolation for five days . Don\u2019t think any insurance would cover you for that .  So treat yourselves nearer home , be good to yourself , the holidays abroad will come , you will enjoy them but even those will be emotional .  Dont invite risk - stay safe xxx love Ruby Rose  ",

If you get side effects you should phone your team , who will advise you of what to do ,  a) ask you to come in so they can check you and give you meds  b) tell you to go to your GP c) advise you if over the counter meds  if they are closed then your next move would be your pharmacist as there are mouth washes , gels etc they can give you. BUT as to speak to the pharmacist , tell them discreetly that you are a Cancer Patient .  Please don\u2019t suffer , I was given lots of medication for moth ulcers and got very quick relief but all prescription.  You are suffering a lot with the cancer , so do not hesitate to ask your team . They have lotions and potions for most side effects .  Sorry not much help.  Take good care of yourself  love  Ruby Rose   Nurses are nurses because they care , let them care for you xx",

I was given a 5 day delayed action anti sickness pill , so sorry I can\u2019t remember what it was called . But phone and request something like that , I was given the tablet just before my chemo .  I had very bad side effects from Dosetaxel- peripheral neuropathy being the worst , that chemo was stopped after 5 . I was told it would make no difference to my outcome to miss one . I really was too poorly .  So please ask for better anti sickness meds . Do you remember to drink 3 litres the first 3 days and 2 litres every day after . Makes a huge difference but can be hard ifvtaste buds go peculiar!! you can also ask for chemo to be reduced - I did and they were going to reduce to 90% but my side effects became too debilitating and chemo was stopped.  So phone and request anti sickness and then phone day before chemo to make sure they are in hand and all organised for you . - it\u2019s your body , your health , you won\u2019t forget about you but unfortunately others can ! Don\u2019t be affraid to keep asking - this advise was given to me by an old family doctor !  Good luck  Ruby Rose  ",

He says that each ward has a safe and money , keys , phones etc can be deposited and you will sign a ward register . Very secure . Just be sensible and don\u2019t leave belongings on show .  You should always give a trusted friend a key for emergencies ( as you live alone ) The Hospital will ask for your next of kin and you could also give them your friends number as a contact .  Now is the time you will need friends , even if you are a very private person . There will be someone who will be happy to help you , people say \u201c ask if you need help\u201d so ask , you will be surprised by the number of good people there is in this world but also the ones we think will be good , will hide !!!

Do you need any further treatment Chemo or Radiotherapy?  Remember some further treatments are decided once the pathology comes back and that can take 2-3 weeks and you would not probably advised until you follow up appointment at about 5/6 weeks.  If you cancel now , will you get your money back ? If you do, I think I would cancel , it\u2019s a big operation and a brilliant one. But it comes with risks and depending if you have your lymph nodes removed too . If you were going on a luxury holiday nearer home I would probably say go for it . Why not phone your breast care nurse /team or your surgeons secretary .  Their secretaries are usually brilliant at helping .  What does your \u201cgut\u201d say ? Usually a good guide .  Good luck with the decision ,. Love  Ruby Rose  ",

Black nail polish on fingers and toes then Sometime I would have other colours put in top . I had Troll stickers , flower stickers etc applied too then a top coat to keep longer . I would also buy a colour similar to what beautician had applied , so that I could top up. I also found any polish with glitter in it lasted longer too.  I now have a vast array of polish ! I do them myself now as the girl who did mine is now battling breast cancer too !! never lost a finger nail , 6 months on and my nails are getting healthy again , I had a ridge in each finger nail for each chemo I had ! All grown out now . I did loose a big toe nail but there was a new one half grown under it .  Still do my nails , Love all the colours and sparkles . I also applied cuticle oil through out treatment . so if anyone wants to treat you - manicure , pedicure , or file and polish , buy you nail polish etc . Or ask them to do it for you .   Wishing you well Love  Ruby Rose  ",

One week later I found a lump on my arm and I called the chemo help line and they weren\u2019t concerned. I was worried and asked if I could go to the hospital and have it checked. I had it checked and they said it was a reactive node and it would disappear and it did but took about 3 weeks . Never seen again. Never gave me any bother either . hope yours turns out the same.    Ruby Rose x ",

Only my early cancer and One lymph node showed up on mammogram and MRI , the couldn\u2019t find the actual cancer tumour until I had my mastectomy and was found in pathology - all good and every thing removed , although only 1 lymph node had shown they took all of mine , think 30 and three were infected . I have had no problems . Thought I was getting lymphodema but it was a side effect of the Chemo I got and all settled now .  Tough one for you . I would phone the Macmillan nurses on here on Monday , they are great and so knowledgeable. It will still be your decision but a more informed one . Breast Cancer Care helpline is open on a Saturday morning and they too are great. I too have had questions I needed answers too - mine was about me getting reduced  Herceptin and the nurses on line were able to give me a better understanding of where my consultants were coming from .  Hope you get some carity  love  Ruby Rose  ",

I was also given a nice hot cup of tea to hug and drink . After 15 minutes you don\u2019t know you have it on . I also took a flask if coffee as sometimes they are so busy and a hot drink does help stops you getting cold , also a couple of light weight fleece blankets with me , to keep cosy ( hospital gave me a blanket too) just watch the tube at the back goes over the back if your seat NOT next to your back . Brrr if you need to go to the toilet they just unplug you and you push your drip to the ladies .  My chemotherapy was Dosetaxel and I was told it had a good success rate with cold cap . My hair bit thin on top after chemo had finished but started to grow back quickly . I\u2019m 63 and my hair was a wee bit thin on top before treatment .  I did NOT find it painful .  Ask your chemo nurse / oncologist if it\u2019s worth trying , they will be honest - or try it and see.  Wishing you well with your chemo , it\u2019s not the best but very doable ,  Love  Ruby Rose  ",

I am going to ask my oncologist for help and advise to accept what I now believe to be the correct treatment plan . This way they will know how I feel without questioning their decision , which if I\u2019m honest,  is I believe the correct one . What I want is someone else to say they totally agree with my treatment plan and all will be well - Big ask ! And not going to happen as this is crystal ball stuff . It\u2019s funny when we start on the treatment journey we are full,of fear and hope , when we near the end of the treatment journey the fear of the unknown is quite overwhelming .Friends also battling cancer ( in other forms) have told me about getting a gym prescription from my doctor - once I am over the final chemo - and ready to get well . I can go to our sports centre and get fit with a tailored regime for me. Plus water aerobics will be back on the agenda - again suited to my age and fitness.  So I have to learn to enjoy each day as it comes and not worry about my cancer coming back .  I think someone referred my post to Macmillan and for this I am so grateful , I got an email that they were concerned and asking me to phone etc .

      "Content": "Good Morning Frilly Flower ,  first diagnosed 3/1/18  i was a bit like you in the beginning , I was diagnosed after routine screening , I had no symptoms. I too was told various diagnosis to begin with . But as more tests done different things came to light . ALL TREATABLE !!  The first lesson we all must learn on this journey - ALWAYS  carry a wee notebook and write down all the questions you want to ask - either at appointments or my telephone to your team . My hospital dont allocate a specific breast care nurse as they are alllivrly and work as a team , this way if someone is on holiday , I\u2019ll or at another clinic YOU will always get someone to speak too.  The next lesson is WAITING the most cruel lesson we need to learn but pathology takes time to culture cells etc in labs .  Yet another lesson and the hardest for me , stop trying to plan your life as before as life is changing and not for the worst- we learn what is most precious to us and take each day or appointment to appointment as it comes .  I went from being an early cancer being treated by lumpectomy , followed by radiotherapy. I ended up with left side mastectomy with immediate DIEP reconstruction , purely because I had lots of tiny pre cancerous cells and one small tumour but spread to lymph nodes . They removed 32 lymth nodes but only 3 with cancer . My operation was frightening to think of and I wanted to run away but it was so successful and once I get my 3D nipple tattoo next year , no one will notice the difference. As my husband says - it\u2019s amazing !  The next shock for me was I had to get Chemo but not Radiotherapy ( who knows that could change ) because I have a heart murmur I\u2019m getting a different chemo plan - every treatment is individual to each patient - IT IS NOT ONE SIZE FITS ALL!  You are an individual and will be treated as one . My Chemo is going well and no great difficulties ( yet) . Every one says I\u2019m amazing which is so good for my confidence. I made up my mind after the first two months of crying every day ( in the shower - very therapeutic) . That when I looked in the mirror , my face looked better with a smile than when greetin!!! So smiley face it is .  Even now I have more questions to ask and I am phoning my oncologists secretary on Monday to ask the questions and I don\u2019t mind a reply by phone or by appointment .  If you read my profile ( flower) and you can see my posts if you scroll down . It\u2019s been an emotional roller coaster but we are fighters and fight we will .  My oncologist nearly jumped out of her seat when my eldest son asked if everything was positive and she said Oooo YES YES  very positive .  I have been very open with all my friends and they have all been fantastic , some special  ones have actually come out if the woodwork if you know what I mean , my house has been like a florists for months . You will find the special friends that you can shed a tear with . My hubby has been brilliant but sometime i want to cry and feel better instantly but he keeps feeling sad for days after we have a joint cry . Just a learning process all round .  The journey ahead will not be easy emotionally but definitely character building .    Just be prepared for anything and everyone on this community has been BRILLIANT, so supportive when I have had bad, sad times and seeking advise on everything , even about is it ok to take a holiday , brilliant tips for operations , managing ANY - IF ANY side effects of treatment but as my nurse said - HEY YOU DONT GO LOOKING FOR THEM !! We have a laugh.  We cancer warriors have a good laugh most days as it beats  crying !  I hope I haven\u2019t frightened you , but just to reassure you that EVERY EMOTION That you feel - fear , anger, sadness, bewilderment, is normal .

I went myself the first time and they were lovely and I chatted and cried and was cared for. Next time took my hubby under the pretext of wanting a nice relaxing cuppa and knowing that someone would chat to him too. Not all the surgeons spoke to him, he felt a bit miffed! But at Maggies it was very casual over a cuppa. I asked for counselling but men being men , my hubby said he was fine !! But every time we have gone back for a nice cuppa as we are early for my appointments , they always speak to him. I\u2019m in a happier place now and only needed the one counselling session but I also know that if I want more I will be seen very quickly as I\u2019m in the system. ( I also lost my 88 year old Mum during all this and I was her carer] . I\u2019m a bit far away - 1 hr drive from Maggies , so haven\u2019t been to yoga or anything yet but I\u2019m booked for the feel good session with make up and goodie bags etc. Plus my employer not playing the game , so speaking to  Macmillan CAB adviser at Maggies.  Yes definitely pay a visit.

      "Content": "Hi AnnJac  i didn\u2019t buy front fastening , I was advised to buy back fastening but also to buy bra extenders . I bought sports bras from Tesco - easy to return if not needed . Bra extenders from sewing   / hobby shops , also good bra shops stock them  yes you will have a catheter ( thank goodness)  I was in hospital gowns for 3 days then I wore front opening night shirt types - roomy ones . Also I liked soft fleecy type pjs with shirt style top . Big with waist to below boobs ( he he )? Yes I would recommend blouses and cardigans .  Lots of pillows , I was given a heart shaped one by hospital , to put under my arm for journey home . First night home I slept on our recliner . Then I was ok in bed but lots of soft pillows , lots of trying to get comfy . BUT NOT SORE !  You will get advise re exercises in hospital , when moving up the bed - bend your knees , dig your heels in and push from heels . Try standing up straight as soon as you can , bottom in and shoulders back ( I had two sections when I had my children - 100 years ago )   If you stoop too much you will get a sore back .  Yes a week will be good , get him to take you a little walk every day - 15- 39 mins - slow walk , you will feel the benefit but not of course if it\u2019s icy ! Let him spoil you .  I wore light support pants and leggings .  My surgery and recovery were text book  no problems .  Be warned :- you may have a melt down ! I did - well I was petrified !! But I ranted  that I wasn\u2019t going while packing !! My son told the anesthetist all my fears - being sick , not waking up again ,  mainly being sick . She prescribed me a different cocktail and reassured me that I would wake up . She prescribed me a tablet for bedtime and I slept till they woke me to go to theatre . Yes I did wake up and NO PAIN, NO SICKNESS - in the morning I sent hubby a selfie !!  Day 2 or was it 3 - I cried most if the day and seems that\u2019s normal after all the trauma , anaesthetics etc .  Once  home I must admit I didn\u2019t like to look in the mirror , I covered my bedroom one ! I couldn\u2019t check myself !!so I asked if a district nurse could call and they were only too delighted . All was well . One day I came out of the shower room and hubby was hovering ( like my shadow ) I always had a wee cry in the shower , so came  out and said / shouted - I suppose you want a look ?!!! Threw open the towel and he just went quiet then said whow!!! Your perfect , all amazing and he just stared - wee bit too long - so that\u2019s when I looked in the mirror properly and yes it was great but I cried and he cuddled me .  So all good and you will just need paracetamol and maybe a codein if your going out to lunch etc .renember if someone asks to take you out say - yes please . You can\u2019t drive for 6 weeks . I also asked to see a physiotherapist, my gp said they didn\u2019t ysysky do that but I said I would like to see one , she was great and made sure I was doing my exercises properly and actually gave me more. I did feel some cursing and it is so important to keep doing your exercises and massaging your breasts . I massaged using E45 emollient wash , while in the shower , I used E45 cream all over my boddy , hubby has continued helping me ( commonly known as milking it ) also Aveeno cream is lovely too . Love getting my back done!  Well I better shut up now !!!  I am getting my 3D Tattoo started next week Good luck and hope all goes smoothly - your getting a bigger op than me - I didn\u2019t need the reduction .  Lots of love  if I\u2019ve missed anything , just ask ruby rose  ",

Keep a note book handy by your bed as sometimes you think of things , once you write them down it\u2019s leaves that box ticked in your mind.  On the subject of private health my consultants , Breast, Plastic and oncologist all said it can take a lot longer to get diagnosis and treatment than on NHS , they tend to have to use NHS for treatment unless you live in a very large city with large private hospitals. But I do know a friend who went private for a second opinion who just confirmed what NHS consultant had said. Of course you may get different medication that NHS can\u2019t pay for , so I wouldn\u2019t rul it out . Maybe as you say go to NHS and tell them that you have private medical cover and ask if there are any medication that NHS can\u2019t pay for due to government restrictions ( be diplomatic ) . Good luck and polish your smiley face , keep asking us questions. We will hold your hand through this.  Love  Ruby Rose xx ",

Nothing is guaranteed though and I figured if I keep half my hair then I would only have half to grow again .  Before my chemo I busied myself and went shopping for my wig and laid one aside . I love it and everyone thinks I have just had my hair done !  I\u2019ve had 2 chemo and I still have my hair - ok I shed some when I wash it - only once a week and very gently . But it\u2019s dyill ok .  Cold cap is very do able - paracetamol 20 minutes before they put in on me And a hot cuppa at the ready , after 10 minutes all ok . I take lots of cosy fleece blankets to keep cosy . I\u2019m fine .  I hope this helps but it all depends what chemo. You get.  Take care  Ruby Rose x ",

      "Content": "Hi  I\u2019m so sorry you are all having a hard time . I have been like your Mum but only in melt down moments - I said things that hurt my family so much but at the time that was how I honestly felt .  My elder son in a very analytical manner told me what I was doing to both sons and my husband . Did I honestly want their last memory of me as being some out of control sobbing woman , spouting mad ness ? Would it help if we sat down together and planned my funeral to the very last moment ? In fact did I have a day in mind ?!! He told me I should just pack in the treatment and let the cancer rampage through my body and they - who love me dearly - would have to stand back and watch because what was the point of going to appointments if I didn\u2019t believe ANYONE?! He then handed me a list of phone numbers , Macmillan , Breast Cancer Care , the Samaratins , Maggies and Breast care nurses .  He said when I\u2019ve made up my mind , just let us know , we can get the funeral director round to discuss things or we can all sit and have a cup of tea and watch a film or cuddle or cry or laugh or go for a walk or just do everything except the undertaker ., they want to help me and fight with me but they can only take so much cruelty as this is real life and they need to work to pay bills which they couldn\u2019t do if I shut them out and gave them all this extra worry. They said I didn\u2019t choose to be Sick , it\u2019s not my fault , I\u2019m not a failure ( sorry but I will always feel one but keep that to myself) don\u2019t let Cancer win !  Well ,  I say these feelings only lasted for a few hours iof meltdowns . Thankfully only twice with a mini third one !  Hard to know if the straight talking approach would work in your situation . But you Mum is robbing you all of happy times  and so cruel on the grand children too.  I offered my husband a divorce ! 43 years we have been married - I said - you can go and get yourself a blonde!!! Well he has ! As I can\u2019t dye my hair anymore and I\u2019m now blonde/white and after DIEP remodelled figure  . It\u2019s an I\u2019ll wind that blows no good .  But depression is an awful thing - I experienced it once when I was in a job that I hated - blackness that\u2019s all I could see - awful and I never understood what depression could me like until then but I was easy cured - moved job !  Thinking about you all , just have lots of hugs and don\u2019t ask to visit - just do it . I don\u2019t think she would reject the grandchildren if they came to visit with sweets and cakes - maybe not flowers as she might think she is dying. ( we all are , nothing surer but not today if we can help it )  read my profile  off to hug hubby xxx love  Ruby Rose ",

Remember they are working and waiting to help you and wanting to help you .  They may email a prescription to a local pharmacy , they may want your mum to go to hospital , they may say to go to your GP but it\u2019s a holiday weekend . So if concerned in the slightest please phone them. No one wants your mum to suffer .  There is a thread - May 2018 Breast Cancer Chemo Club which is very useful to read and post on .  Also you can search for Breast Cancer Chemo Tips .  Hope this helps but never be afraid to ask your mums team , they are best placed to help, even if the out of hours number says it\u2019s for emergency , please phone them and they will give you advise to access help.  Love Ruby Rose xx",

My sons are 36 and 39 and I was a childminder for years so kept all the toys for grandchildren - mmmm both sons still single and I think I may be jinxing things by keeping all the toys . But been ndy for when my nephew visits from Canterbury but he\u2019s 11 now !! So I\u2019ll keep all  the Lego from 1 to 100 years . Girl over road starting childminding - mmm very handy , just took over books and games plus microscope for her elder son .  With my peripheral neuropathy bad in my feet , I feel I\u2019ve walked miles .  Oncologist appointment in the morning at 11.15   plus fasting bloods at 10.15 - I\u2019ll be starving ! I\u2019m taking part in add aspirin trial . See what transpired .  But im knackered .  Must get a fit bit and start walking but aqua aerobics are great for me just now . Funny we \u201crun\u201d in the water round the pool the she says turn but with the waves we make it\u2019s hard going fighting them. Great exercise for the facial cheeks - so much laughter .  See what Oncologist says tomorrow and if I\u2019m getting pills to take !  Hapoy walking and hope to join in soon - once loft clear !  Love  Ruby Rose xx My face looks better when I smile - so smile it is ! ",

      "Content": "Good morning everyone, lovely sunny day here on the East Coast of Scotland ! Very blustery ! Not looking forward to today , I am going to a close friends Mother\u2019s funeral , she had a good life and died at 91 years , but it\u2019s the first funeral I will have been too since my own mothers in April , when I had just had my first chemo . So going to emotional. Also I\u2019m getting my nails done first thing - so far they are looking ok but I know I could still loose them , but the girl who does them has just been told they are positive that the breast lump she found is cancer , she had a biopsy but that didn\u2019t go well and has to be repeated next week . Just brings all the emotions of those first weeks back . It\u2019s all just happening to often now - soo sad but glad she had confided in me and I\u2019m thankful that I have always been very cheery and positive when I\u2019ve been getting my nails done ( day before chemo when we all usually feel good) so we will keep smiling and I\u2019ll be there for her if she needs me , she has sisters and lots of friends .  Have a good day everyone and stay safe if your still experiencing high winds .

I did walk home on my own but between the peripheral neuropathy in my feet and my iffy eyesight , I felt a bit uncomfortable. Getting new glasses on thursday . The joys of treatment !!!  But !! Last night hubby and I went out ! Dinner with friends then a cabaret act at the Golf Club ( I\u2019m a social member) 60s music and a wee bit comedy . We danced ! Met lots of nice people who said nice things to me . Lots of laughs and we got home after 12 midnight !! Brilliant ! Only down side is that everyone I know with cancer have lost their hair during chemo - ME? I\u2019m loosing it now 8 weeks after , but I was very poorly with last chemo . Sons advice was - Mum just don\u2019t stand under a spotlight and no one will see your shiny head !!! Gee thanks - the place was full of downlighters! Maybe time to wear wig more . I like it but I thought that was behind me !!  Anyway I digress !! No aqua aerobics in the morning as problems with the pool ? So will try a walk with hubby - to doctors for blood test - oooo excitement! Sleep well everyone Love Ruby Rose  ",

If not please phone them , they are so knowledgable and will support you - give you facts and terminology to arm yourself for your visit to your GP . When my hubby was in his early 50s he had disabling hip pain and GP said he was too young for a hip replacement . Well I sent him back and he seen Gp again saying he couldn\u2019t go home without s referral and that I - his wife - had said he should sit in the surgery all day if need be . He had further tests and his hip was bone on bone and yes he got his hip replacement. It\u2019s your body and you know it best . If they don\u2019t attend to you medically they will end up attending to you sychologicaly !!  So please speak to someone on this helpline then go back to your GP.  Good luck and let us know how you get on .  Love  Ruby Rose  ",

So he said we propose doing a left mastectomy with immediate reconstruction . Like you initially told lumpectomy and radiotherapy , but after reading in hear about several ladies getting a lumpectomy then as they didn\u2019t get clear margins , having to go back for further surgery to get clear margins and some three times then a mastectomy ! i was relieved with my course of surgery . My plastic surgeon and specialist reconstruction nurse were brilliant . I had DIEP reconstruction - had a melt down on morning if admittance  but once I got to hospital I was still very tearful but everyone was great . Operation was long but I knew nothing but it\u2019s hard on family . I  At my first checkup after op I was told  \u201cwe got all the cancer\u201d those few words mean so much .  Since the cancer was also in 3 lymph nodes then I needed Chemo .to mop up any stray cells that might have gone walk about .  All finished now .  I have a son with a medical biological and genetic background and he was very blunt about what would happen to me if I didn\u2019t go for surgery !  Phone the Macmillan nurse on the number on this site . I have phoned a couple of times and they are so knowledgeable and informative . They helped me consider my options . Im delighted with my surgery , my new breast is amazing . I know what the future may hold - one way or another but I know I have done everything to continue to smell the roses  for as long as is humanly possible  .  Lots of Love  Ruby Rose  Lorna x",

Can\u2019t walk far at all! This morning a bit light headed - is this fatigue ? Feel ok otherwise . I will be phoning the hospital this morning to make sure my Dosetaxel is being reduced . Just wanted others opinion re fatigue - if I sit and watch tv or do my jigsaw I\u2019m fine . Doing wee bits around the house - my elder son who left Home 17 years ago is returning home to live with us !!!! He is off to Uni to study MSc Adult Nursing - huge step for him having left a very senior position and extremely well paid one - but one he said wasn\u2019t making him happy - so credit to him ! Fortunately I still have my late mums house, where he is storing his belongings , also we are waiting to see who goes to live there first him or US lol!!  Thankfully my husband is great and getting his old room in order . Fun times and my sons support will be great , especially for his dad .

      "Content": "Hi Peterawake  I know it\u2019s so hard to receive less treatment that we think we need , I had chemo shortened and herceptin reduced too . I found speaking to the Macmillan nurses in this site really good , they put all arguments  for and against and advise you appropriately.  Remember chemotherapy is a HUGE cocktail and not without risks . Chemo cures but it can also kill.  Nowadays the medics look at the whole picture of treatment and life after treatment with the emphasis being on quality of life .  I have been left with side effects that could be permanent , if I had received my full chemo I might have been left not being able to walk and if I had received my full Herceptin I might have had permanent heart damage due to a pre existinsting heart murmur . I almost begged for more but they refused .  After speaking the the Macmillan nurse I have accepted their decision, I still worry but getting on with life .  Keep asking till you accept their decision, it\u2019s your life .  Love Ruby Rose  ",

      "Content": "Hi NiceCuppa yes chemo makes your skin super photosensitive! You MUST wear factor 50 sun block , plus a hat . I never sat  in direct sunshine during treatment and up to  a month after . Just get used to showering and applying sun screen every day . One evening a neighbour visited me but wouldn\u2019t come into the house as she had a cold , we stood chatting in the garden at 8 o\u2019clock in the evening for only 10 minutes ( no sunscreen as showered and in pjs ) well I came out in a red rash ! That\u2019s how sensitive your skin will be .  So HAT , SUNBLOCK, and LOOSE CLOTHES. You will be fine , pale and interesting remember too much unprotected sunbathing  is not good for anyone  .  Personally I bought new furniture and blinds for my wee summerhouse , lady Year was a scorcher !  Take care  love  Ruby Rose  ",

Went back a few days later alone and got a completely different one that I felt happiest in . I liked the staff and I liked the selection and that was it . I thought I would answer your question to move you up the page .  Yes it\u2019s a good idea to wear your wig before you need it , then you will see that NO ONE.

Think that\u2019s what\u2019s happened with the thread , totally irrational but only because of cancer mucking up our thoughts . All very sad .  I\u2019m having a meeting with my oncologist today ( asked for by me ) and the before cancer person in me knows I\u2019m being an over reactive stupid bitch makeing life hell for all my loved ones . But the Cancer me thinks I\u2019m being totally short treated , although I do have at least 5 valid questions to ask .The Cancer me feels old ,small,and useless , I\u2019m going to wash my hair ( dosetaxel only chemo- never known anyone else with this regime  ) so still have my hair ! Although in the colour and style my late mother would never have worn ! I am going to do my nails and try and Power Dress for my appointment as the last time I asked if something would happen I was told in no uncertain terms NO IT HAS BEEN DECIDED ! I was in hospital at the time - much to my shame and disappointment- time on my hands and grieving for my mum ( it actualy took a couple of months to hit me ) so I was at rock  bottom. This week got injection to boost my white blood cells but I have had a lot of pain and to my shame found it hard to cope , also mega constipation - more pain and bleeding . So hard to eat well when I can taste anything . So it\u2019s going to be an interesting day , today !  Maybe they will release the awake thread to start afresh and even more fun for participants and folk like me reading and laughing .  The thought of meeting this highly educated oncologist today and mentioning pain and constipation is starting my irrational fears again . I\u2019m 62 but next to this usually lovely young woman , I feel 100 - as if I\u2019ll ever be 100   lol !   Hope they get the thread up again or start a new one - call it \u201c in the wee sma hours \u201c . Sorry for your loss of your friend , I think we feel it more in our situation .  Hugs Ruby Rose ",

      "Content": "Hi Sizzles , I was due to get 6 chemo  of Dosetaxel but only managed 5 . They wouldn\u2019t give me the 6th as the peripheral neuropathy was quite bad , my last chemo was on the 6th July . My fingers and feet are gettting better but I might be left with life long differences . The tops of my fingers are bad but I did manage to sew  a hem up but my finger tips were painful . My feet vary from day to day , my toes always feel like I am walking on sandpaper .i often have to take my husbands hand or a friends arm when out walking  I need to get my toe  nailes trimmed and filed at the beautician ( I cant feel them to cut them myself ) - fortunately I am in a position to get a file and polish every three weeks , also get my finger nails done too as they have been effected too even though I got them painted black before every chemo .not lost any though. I attended a meeting at our Maggies centre and there were people - men and women , who had life changing effects from peripheral neuropathy.  So it\u2019s a balancing act between trying to rid our bodies of cancer without disabling us with side effects .  Apart from the peripheral neuropathy, I also have chemo brain , which effects my short term memory, plus I need glasses now . Hopefully all will improve BUT I am so glad that I didn\u2019t get the last chemo . They assured me it wouldn\u2019t effect the outcome .  I can manage the side effects I have but who knows if I had gotten the 6th .  Of course it prays on my mind , I also could only get 6 Herceptin injections as opposed to the recommended 9 or 18 , but after lots of doubt on my mind I have accepted my oncologists decision. I have a pre existing heart murmur- nothing to worry about unless you take medicine that can harm the heart - and it did - but will heal itself . But could have ended in heart failure if I had had the planned 18.  Dont be afraid to ask questions and keep asking until you feel you can accept their decision. Phone the MacMillan nurses on the number on this site - I did - they are brilliant and put everything into layman\u2019s terms and put across the oncologists point of view etc . So please phone them .  Love  Ruby Rose  ",

I was 7 days in hospital . i was just about back to normal at 6 weeks then it was chemo for me ! I had a tough time as my mum died two days before my first chemo , but I managed all her arrangements and funeral , I was very tired but I did it , I was her carer for years and wanted to continue to do so to the very last for her .  You cant drive for 6 weeks but that is normal and due to me having DIEP , which is abdominal surgery .  My hospital had a specialist reconstruction nurse and she was and still is a wonderful knowledgeable  person , a very seniot nurse .  I can still phone her .  As your consultant quoted 5 hours I don\u2019t think it will be DIEP. I would phone your BCN and ask her and ask about a specialist nurse who can give you all the ins and outs .  Really it\u2019s all to do with which kind of reconstruction you are offered. Told I might not need chemo but I did to get any cancer cells that may have gonecwalk about . No radiotherapy for be though .  Love  Ruby Rose ",

I was in surgery from 8.30am back on my side room at 10.15 pm - a long time but I was none the wiser. My operation and reconstruction has been a huge success and text book .

If my heart was ok ( apart from my murmur) would I get more Herceptin?\u201d  No was the reply - it has been decided ! Quite sharp too. Told if my heart got damaged then they might not be able to fix it . I am prepared to pay for scans - well I have my pension pot that I can\u2019t spend and looks like  I never will! Worked and saved hard and at 62 ! ?? Why did they bother ? I\u2019m half way through and I was getting on great but disappointed that I was admitted to hospital with high temp and low white cell count. I have to get an injection 2 days after my next chemo to help keep my white blood count up. I have also developed peripheral nueropathy on the very tops of my fingers and toes.  Is Chemo worth it ? I\u2019m loosing a year from my life and looks like I might not get it back. They say they got all the cancer when I had my MX and only three nodes were infected but they took them all. It\u2019s a bit like fixing one thing then it goes wrong and they try that and fix the fix   and it escalates . Sorry I just feel so down - how can oncologist say 6 will be fine when all studies say 18 Herceptin , I was even told that there are studies that say 3 is enough and I\u2019m getting 6 , so I\u2019m getting extra . I found a study saying 9 but not 3 or 6 .  Suppose I could spend my pension pot on a second opinion but in Scotland that would be frowned at.  A very wilted  Ruby Rose ",

My main question is :- if my oncologist  thinks my heart  is as bad as she says it is , not getting anymore than 6 Herceptin, then why am not not seeing a cardiologist and why is she not following NICE recommendations ( not law ) and booking a heart scan at the recommended 3 months , which is next week?!  My murmur was discovered and discounted about 10 years ago after a year of heart tests that in the end were put down to the menopaus - I was in theatre and cardiologist did his last test and said - right your fine , your hearts fine , now go and book your holiday . He had always suspected that my symptoms were due to the menopaus !  Am I too old at 62? Have they run out of money ? i telephoned  the Macmillan help  line yesterday and nurse has advised me to tell her secretary how I feel - my son will do this for me as he has medical experience and knows the jargon. He phoned today and he spoke to someone covering for her , who was very nice and agreed with what the Macmillan nurse said - that my oncologist will be upset to discover how upset I am. He will phone again tomorrow .  Also my oncologist keeps referring to studies but doesn\u2019t tell me the names of these studies , then how can I read up on them myself .  My son says I shouldn\u2019t have to go private as what i am asking for is basic care .  Just wish he had spoken to her secretary today , I\u2019m on edge .  Thanks for being there for me  Ruby Rose ",

Then went to my late mums flat and sorted through more of her clothes and shed  buckets of tears but very therapeutic. I cried , talked to her and was angry with her, I washed her living room window and down fell a bonnie white feather . Bloods weren\u2019t back when nurse called for pre chemo assessment - ugh , but hopefully all ok , if I don\u2019t hear by lunch time tomorrow , all will go ahead on Friday . Keep you informed how next week goes. Love  Ruby Rose    ",

When I was doing my exercises  I found it helpful to \u201cjoin a class\u201d ffollowing the class , I  my exercises  written down but once I seen others doing them it was easier .  So if you know what you are supposed to do then have a look and see if someone has posted people doing the massage . Just type in the search box what you want and see what comes up . Ignore any rubbish !!  I found easy exercises to do when I had congestion in my arm on the operated side .

I do have peripheral  neuropathy slightly on fingers and toes which I reported last chemo , not interfering with daily activities . I was just wondering if anyone had MAGIC cream or potions !!! Wish . I suffered badly last couple of days with watery eyes but yesterday went to boots and was handed dry eye drops and yes magic instant relief , told although my eyes were watery ,  my tears wouldn\u2019t have been good quality , so suggested the drops for dry eyes . Maybe pop in today and see if they have any cheap and magic help for my feet ! I\u2019m going to the sea side with friends today , so I\u2019ll take my water shoes and go paddling !! nothing like a walk in the North Sea to reinvigorate one !!  i read your attachments , interesting about ice packs on my feet while having chemo but I\u2019m wearing a cold cap ( still gave 90% of my hair )so might be a bit too chilly !!! I\u2019ll take with me though and see how I get on . I\u2019m up fior  trying anything - within reason . Also good to read to apply cream and not massage .  Thanks  for your help  Ruby Rose ",

I would think one appointment will be with your Breast surgeon , then the other could be for one of many reasons . If you are having reconstruction in the future - it could be with plastic surgeon . You may have options of radiotherapy or chemotherapy, or you could be getting tablets so could be with Oncologist . You don\u2019t have too long to wait and I know that any wait is too long but look after yourself and all will become clear . An oncology appointment could also be to explain everything and that you don\u2019t need any further treatment .  Hugs love  Ruby Rose  ",

Lol - always wash your bottom with water after each movement if possible then dry and apply nappy cream and I also got boots own hemorroid cream ( just in case ) - my bottom and skin have survived !!!  You should also get meds for heartburn from your team.  So phone your team as soon as you can and get medication , if too far to go to hospital they may ask you to go to your own gp or they can email prescriptions to a pharmacy .

      "Content": "Hi Yve1362 I had 3 infected lymph nodes and they removed 32.  I had my left mastectomy with immediate DIEP reconstruction in March 18. My operation was text book . I was in hospital 7 days , no real pain , mainly discomfort , I took paracetamol and occasionally codein. When I came home I had no drains or anything.  First night home I slept sitting up on our recliner which was very comfortable.  The order of the day when you get home is rest.  I must admit when I got home I covered all the mirrors , I asked a district nurse from my doctors practice to call in and check  my wounds which she did twice. I came out the shower one morning and said to my husband \u201cWell I suppose you want a look \u201c he said yes , I threw open the towel and silence !!! I peaked through shut eyes and he was standing there in amazement , he said it\u2019s really amazing , fantastic . A few days later I looked - through tears ( it\u2019s a very emotional time) and I was pleasantly surprised . Every medical professional who has had to check me , all say my new breast is perfect. I have no difference between bra cups , at first there was a little difference but once settled they are equal .  You need to do your exercises , Macmillan have some on utube too. I also asked my gp for physio , told that\u2019s not usual but I wanted to be reassured that I was doing them correctly , physiotherapist was lovely and kept me on the right track and I only seen  her the once .     You will need plenty of moisturing cream - at first I used E45 then Aveena , it\u2019s important to moisturise and massage your breast and tummy . E45 emoliant bath is lovely to massage while in the bath. Ok your tummy and breast will be numb but mine is getting more feeling , don\u2019t think it will ever be normal but hey ho! I\u2019m not to sure of my tummy button ! Hubby cleaned it for me too ! It looks ok but different to my old one . I have a lovely flat tummy !  I now have lovely new feminine bras but non wired . I like wearing a top I have with a wee peak hole at the cleavage and I look good !!! Yes I do !  Be warned on the day before my operation i had a MEGA meltdown !! I wasn\u2019t going , i was cancelling etc etc . But I went to hospital , yes petrified and the staff picked up on that . The anaesthetist came round and I told her I was frightened of being sick and she changed the cocktail and I had no sickness . I was very well taken care of by everyone . Day 2, I couldn\u2019t stop crying but my plastic surgeon said she wouldn\u2019t expect anything else , due to the amount of medication I had had the day of the operation . She was the voice of reason.  I\u2019ve had it tough as my mum died 5 weeks later and 2 days before my first chemo .( I was her carer) But I\u2019m getting there , chemo going well , I wear the cold cap Bd still got my hair , I\u2019ve been admitted once due to high temp. I have 2 more chemo to get . I had my Plastic surgeon check up on Monday and all well and \u201cwhow\u201d used again re my breast .  I would honestly say the fear and emotional pain is the biggest hurdle on this journey .  I wish you well and please ask any questions.  Love and hugs  Ruby Rose 1362",

Told it\u2019s normal . Powerfull stuff chemo ! That\u2019s why they need your wounds to be well healed before starting chemo .  I started chemo 10 days after my 1st oncology appointment . When my mum died they said I could postpone for 2 weeks and it wouldn\u2019t effect my results. I went ahead , it was hard but I was so busy organising her funeral to worry about the chemo , chemo was kind to me . ( that\u2019s time Lol!)  its been ok . Don\u2019t just massage your wounds , massage your full breast , gently .  Thank you for your kind wishes . I hope you get your oncology appointment soon. You could phone your  BCN and chase it on .  Love Ruby Rose ",

I know you want to be independent but sometime we just have to accept help on the understanding that you will return that help in the decades to follow .  My son of 39 moved back home to go to uni and we are keeping him , our choice , he has accepted this graciously. Maybe too graciously I\u2019m sure someone will be along soon to point you in the financial help direction or you could phone the Macmillan helpline on here and I\u2019m sure they will help . Also citizens advice can help , they also have them at Maggies , if you have one near you,  then pop in, they are lovely and NOT full of sick people . Full of everyday folk trying to get the best from life . Plus you can register for the Look good feel good session where you get lots of lovely cosmetics and treats .  Keep in touch on here , wonderful people with lots of knowledge to help you .

I take paracetamol half an hour before they put the cap on me , I have a couple of fleece  blankets . My husband makes me a flask of hot coffee which is great to hold  and sip . After ten minutes the cold eases . Another lady I know ( chemo buddy aged 73!)with other cancers ,is using the cold cap too and getting on fine. I wear my wig after the cold cap as your hair is very flat . I love my  wig , it\u2019s a free one from NHS in Scotland . Looks better than my own hair !! Lady at Maggies said when I was starting that even if I lost  half my hair , I would only have half to grow after !!  See what your oncologist says . It\u2019s only a tiny layer that gets the cold .

It\u2019s just the thought of taking a drug then having take other drugs to counteract the side effects of the first drug - main one being heart burn - ok I could be lucky and not get any,  bye the way a side effect of omeprzole is bone thinning ! So itoes round in a circle i also signed up to take part in the add aspirin trial ,( seen research nurse before oncology registrar )  but warned about heartburn too, might give it a miss as the thought of 5 years taking a placebo is a bit worrying , they give either a placebo or one of two strengths of aspirin . Seems a long  time at my age although reassuring that they think I will still be here at the end of 5 years !!  Im really in a pity mood tonight as he wasn\u2019t bothered about my peripheral neuropathy in my feet and hands - \u201c might improve , might not ah but shouldn\u2019t get worse \u201c gee thanks for that .  Thank you very much for replying and I will try and give myself a shake in the morning .  Ruby Rose ",

      "Content": "Good morning Dreamthief ,  i cant contact the oncologist as I have been told I will no longer see that department . Also a few months ago I questioned the fact that I was only getting 6 Herceptin and she didn\u2019t take kindly to that  , she was very defensive and even my very placid husband got a shock at her manner . I now accept her decision due to my heart murmur and now see at 56% re MUGA scan , my heart isn\u2019t too great . So if cancer doesn\u2019t get me my heart will . Not seeing cardiologist though !??.  Im worried about my teeth and jaw with this drug but seeing my dentist tomorrow for X-rays . He\u2019s very good and very knowledgeable. I trust him .  I have never had a scan to check for osteoporosis. Not been told about chews but I have bought vitamin D myself.  Dont know when or how I will get the prescription as letter being sent to my GP . But I don\u2019t go to my GP and they dont know me . I did occasionally go to a doctor but she has retired. I usually phone for a sick line but expect I\u2019ll have to visit to plead for one now . My work just said your 62 with cancer maybe you should retire !!! I\u2019m hanging on as even if they don\u2019t pay me I get £70 approx from gov .  My PN is manageable but I dont know if I should be walking through the pain or discomfort or what . Both my feet to my ankles and even my right knee were effected .thats why they stopped my chemo after no.5.  Now right foot to sole of heal but toes are worst , left foot is a lot better . Top third of fingers tingle and after doing things are painfull ,  oncologist not really interested as I suppose there is nothing they can do .  Technically im cancer free but the oncologist I seen yesterday was like a wee boy and a very wet squid - no enthusiasm at all.  I was looking forward to booking a holiday and I was told I could , I just feel I would be irresponsible and unfair to my husband ( who wants to bubble wrap me and stick me somewhere safe !) . i see the plastic surgeon next month and that\u2019s it . Mammogram in March when it could all kick off again ! im down for the add aspirin trial , don\u2019t know if I will do it now but only good thing about it , I would get ct scans etc  and continual monitoring even if I get the placebo.  Just hate being reminded every day by taking pills - never ever taken pills until now !  Suppose I just have to get on with it .  Highlight of my week - easy aqua aerobics! I feel normal there .  Thanks for replying and great to hear your other half is doing well.  Ruby Rose x ",

Determined to be on my best behaviour and try not to be too hyper ! Sons doing Christmas dinner and I will take care of the music and. Prosecco! I will smile , I will be happy as I owe it my three men after the year I\u2019ve put them through . Going to be tough though ! But at least I\u2019ve finished treatment . But that gives me bit much time to think ( overthink !).   I know I have everyone on here battling with me too . We will all do our best , just as we cancer fighters do EVERY day !  Love Ruby Rose   i have screen shot that verse , so I can easily refer to it",

Some ladies have been a member of this communty for years , how do you manage ?  I really don\u2019t think I can do this , to knowingly inflict all this misery on family is so cruel . I have tried hard to be positive .

The consultant told me the side effects of Docetaxel and then said as for The Herceptin they will overtaken by the Docetaxel - nice - not .  I know everyone is different but I\u2019m expecting a rough time but what frightens me most is being sick as my tummy after the Diep surgery ( will be 5 and a half weeks from surgery) isn\u2019t ready for the reaching I usually end up if I\u2019m ill. I usually have to go to out of hours etc and get a jab to stop me being sick) I will tell them this at me pre-chemo appointment on the 11th .

Thank you everyone, had a good meeting for pre chemo assessment and all good but then I\u2019ve been floored, my dear Mum died so suddenly but peacefully to night , while in respite . She was 88 and the end came after 24hrs of having a chest infection. Care Home staff in shock at the suddenness.  I have spoken to the chemo ward senior nurse , at first I thought I can\u2019t start my chemo with this happening but Mum and I had planned and paid for her funeral a couple of years ago . So just really flowers to organise tomorrow and any loose ends to be tied up at undertakers. So I\u2019m going ahead on Friday, I owe it to my husband and sons and I\u2019m sure the chemo nurses will take care of me .  How many tears can one person cry ? How much heartache can one person take ? I must pull up my BIG pants and smile and greet the new dawn with strength.  A very very sad Ruby Rose ",

      "Content": "Hi Peanut11, i have a heart murmur and because of this I couldn\u2019t get FEC-T , plus the 18 Herceptin injections  . The plan changed to  6 x Dosetaxel but I only managed 5 as I became too poorly with side effects . 6 Herceptin injections - I questioned this and had an extra meeting to discuss with my oncologist, she said no I am not giving you anymore due to the danger to your heart - she said to me \u201c how would I like to be clear of cancer but in a wheel chair due to heart failure?\u201d So I excepted that 6 was best - I had pushed for 9 injections but she wouldn\u2019t budge and I\u2019m grateful because the chemo and herceptin have damaged my heart but should heal itself and I am not on any medication for it .  I would have been delighted if I had been allowed the 9 . But I have been told that 6 is good . ( told there have been trials with 6 injections and results were favourable too)  I spoke too the Macmillan nurses on here , they are so knowledgeable and can explain things from different perspective.  Its a hard choice but I\u2019m sure in a year there will be no choice it will be 9. Injections .  Love  Ruby Rose xx remember they don\u2019t throw everything at us cancer fighters anymore - they take a balanced view as we are going to be here a long time and they look at the effect side effects have on our lives . The medics want us to have a high quality of life . ",
