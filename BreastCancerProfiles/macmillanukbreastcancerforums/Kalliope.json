      "Content": "YES. I totally get that. In fact, being 'released' from the treatment and routine and regular medical support was just as hard as having to decide to go ahead with the treatment.  I think pretty much everyone feels like that, which doesn't make the situation better I know, but can make you feel less alone. I was talking to my Macmillan nurse the other day, and she was saying that now the treatment of cancer is over, it is time to heal your body and mind, and create a new normal life for yourself, whatever that means for you.  I was advised to join a H.O.P.E course that Macmillan run at lots of centres, and it really helped me, as it gave me a variety of tools to use to cope with the challenges thrown in my way, and connected me with a bunch of other cancer patients who I am still in touch with. I still need support from my nurses, a psychologist , this website etc. I am told I doing well considering.... it doesn't always feel that way, but I am not alone and my lord that really helps. Be kind to yourself my lovely, you've been through huge challenges, so don't rush yourself. If you could remind me of the same every now and then I'd appreciate it ;-) *hugs* Kalliope xx p.s. In the womb cancer group we have a Three Good Things thread which a lot of us find helpful to help us see the good in often challenging days. If you want to join in, you are very welcome, we're a friendly bunch xx",
