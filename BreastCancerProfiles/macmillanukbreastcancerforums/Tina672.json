    "Content": "Hi .I got diagnosed with breast cancer in may 2018 and had mastectomy on one breast after finding out I had hormone receptor cancer. I had a a reconstruction using tummy fat/blood vessels .I returned back to work January 2019 .I have had to return to Hospital every 5 weeks to get tummy drained as keeps filling with blood like fluid where it hasn't stuck right inside. When it fills up my belly goes rock hard and is very uncomfortable where even walking is an issue .I feel nobody understands how uncomfortable it actually is .Now it has filled up really bad and feel bad to phone in sick as feel that my boss doesn't understand and thinks I am making it up .Has anyone else had tummy problem after surgeryÂ  Kind Regards",
