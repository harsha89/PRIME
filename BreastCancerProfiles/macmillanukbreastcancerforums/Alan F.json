      "Content": "Spoke to oncologist today on routine visit, agreed live vaccine was to be avoided at all cost but he was a bit vague about the kennel cough risks, seemed to come as a bit of a surprise, \"never been asked that before\" to quote Having said that it was not one of my better visits, I think he was having a bad day.  Might be better to talk to a vet. I am however still digging. Best Wishes",

      "Content": "Took the dog to the vet today who advised me that whilst my dog can have it's normal vaccines they would not propose to carry out the kennel cough prevention as this is a live vaccine because, I am undertaking Chemotherapy. (Total fluke how the conversation arose) They say it could compromise the well being of any potentially immunocompromised individual including young children, pregnant women, those on Chemotherapy etc. The issue has been explained as exhalation of vaccine from the pet's nose and can last for up to 6 weeks after treatment, therefore creating an airborne virus, if I recall the vet mentioned whooping cough and pneumonia as potential risks to humans. Will be asking the oncologist tomorrow on routine visit what is his view.  Vet also says that 'annual' vaccine will last for 15 months!",

      "Content": "It is worrying that the oncologist and the vets are a bit vague on this issue and there is an obvious lack of awareness of the facts. You have found pretty much what I did although my information suggested 6 weeks was the risk phase. Interestingly I also learned that although the kennel cough is an \"annual\" vaccine it will last for up to 16 months without any booster, dates on record card confirm this, so a little bit of opportunism from the doggy doctor perhaps. However we decided to go ahead with the vaccine with some enhance precautions, so far no issues and with 2.5 days to go to the end of my treatment regime one remains cautious but optimistic. No disclaimer sought. I think I may contact Macmillan directly and ask them to raise awareness of the potential issues.  Trust you are well and best wishes.",

      "Content": "Routine annual vaccines are not the issue as far as I am aware. The problem is the Kennel Cough option and is only required where the animal is to be boarded where kennels insist on this preventative treatment, this is a live vaccine and a such should be avoided if there is a presence of anyone who is immunosuppressed or on chemo. The virus can be passed to humans as respiratory illness such as whooping cough , pneumonia or similar.. My information is based on dogs however but believe cats are no different. From my own experience the oncologist will be vague but will say no contact with live vaccines. Best wishes",
