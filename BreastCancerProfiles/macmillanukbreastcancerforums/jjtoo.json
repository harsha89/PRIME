      "Content": "Hi Shirl, Your post about being able to stay in in Edinburgh, eased my mind quite a bit, thank you! And when I had my second ultrasound yesterday, to check lymph nodes, (which radiologist thought looked alright), he said they could perhaps do a push(?) regime, a higher dose, for shorter time. They still don't know what cancer type I have though, radiologist said he has never seen it before, as it seems to be mainly in the skin, so I now have to go for an MRI in Edinburgh. I live near Coldstream and retired up here 4 years ago, so I don't know many people - Billy No Mates me! It has never worried me before, as I love living on my own (my brothers live in Australia), mainly just researching family history. I do plan to go to/ring GP surgery to ask re volunteer drivers for the operation, after CNS rings Monday to tell me what's next. There is also a Berwickshire group but although I am in a Scottish GP practice, I live in Northumberland, so not sure if covered. I'll sort it somehow....... Best wishes, Jan",

      "Content": "Hi, I've been lurking in this group since January, from the Vulval one which I joined last year after having VIN2/3 which is just being watched at present. In Aug 2014 I found a tiny lump the size of a grain of rice in my right breast, which turned out to be just a cyst. It started growing slowly (which I'd read was normal), but about 8 months ago it started turning hard, and then I realised it no longer moved. Also I couldn't feel under it when doing self exams, and it was protruding from the skin a bit, so thought I'd better finally have it drained & went to GP for referral back to breast Clinic. Surgeon said it would be like cheese, and too thick to drain now, so did another mammogram, nothing showed, then ultrasound, which did, but radiologist said he didn't know what it was, and they needed to take a biopsy, which they did and said to see Clinical Nurse Specialist for results in 10 days. She rang on morning of appt to say results not back yet, to save me the 2 hour round trip, which I really appreciated. Although I had been googling on here and other cancer and dermatology sites (have a science background so want to know exactly what is going on), I couldn't find any precise explanation of what it could be either as cancer or not. So went along for results Mon 29th Feb, thinking I'd been over dramatizing, and it would be nothing, but was told grade 2 invasive carcinoma, ER+, HER- at present but they were still looking at the biopsy. Going for underarm lymph node ultrasound Friday 4th, then probable WLE 2 weeks after results. Feeling rather detached about it all so far, although I expect that may change. I've always been very independent, and hate asking for help, but logistics of getting to & from hosp (I live alone in the country), especially if need R/T which means longer trip to Edinburgh are my main worries as I can't sort them out. The CNS said take each step at a time, as we find out results, which I'm tring to do, but just a bit annoyed that as cysts are uncommon apparently in postmenopausal women (I'm 64), why was I not followed up earlier. Has anyone else had this happen to them?",

However the cleanser doesn't seem to remove the Evonail polish itself, no matter how much I use/scrub/have soaked my nails in warm water beforehand, and I have to resort to non-acetone polish remover. Have I been applying it too thickly do you think? Any other suggestions greatly appreciated..... Good wishes to you all, Jan x",

Originally was told probable WLE, losing nipple, and probable Sentinel node biopsy, and hormone tabs. How long after surgery were you able to hold a hairdryer for 5-10 minutes (I have a bob that has just taken a year to grow!)?. I have dry shampoo at the ready, but am wondering should I just have my hair cut very short beforehand. Chemo hasn't been mentioned yet, if it had I'd definitely cut. Best wishes to you all,",

      "Content": "Oh Skye01, my heart goes out to you. Just when we thought you'd been able to turn things around. Would it be better on yourself to just not see any of your family for a while, say you've had enough of their selfishness/non support, and that you need to focus on getting better yourself. Think I'd ask your niece to move out now too, if she is absolutely no help at all, and just dragging you down. Ignore them! I wonder if it is because what your family may have said to shop staff, that makes you think they are staring, or is it just because they are sympathetic that you have cancer, but are awkward in how to deal with it or discuss it (as most people are). Just smile at them and be pleasant, and carry on as normal with them, and you may find they'll respond. It also may be that your family are at a loss how to deal with your cancer too, everyone reacts differently. Although from what you've said, perhaps not, if they've always been like that. When my brother came over from Oz to look after me after my mastectomy in May, I felt he was being a bit flippant at times and not caring, but when I mentioned it (after much soul searching, as I am NOT good with expressing my feelings), he said that was how he has coped with things his whole life. And I thought he had just been easy going, always a joker..... We've lived over 1000 miles apart since I was 22, so never had time really to discuss things. Have you made an appointment with your BCN to see what support she can give you or refer you to? Like complementary therapies, counselling, other practical help? Give Macmillan a ring too/again even just for a chat to make you feel better. Hang in there, Love and hugs, Jan xxx",

      "Content": "Hi dollydaydream01, I'm working my way through discovering what helps with the disgusting taste too, and am also coming up for my 3rd FEC-T out of 6 next week So far, anything with ginger helps -biscuits, ginger ale, ginger tea, ginger icecream. Polo mints -anything mint really but only helps for a while. Cinnamon Sweet things (don't go overboard!) but apparently they counteract the bitter taste according to a book I just read about yesterday written by a chef at a cancer centre Rebecca Katz \"The Cancer Fighting Kitchen\". Available on amazon but a bit pricey, although you can download some of the recipes from her website. I might try some when I feel like cooking! See below about it https://www.fredhutch.org/en/news/center-news/2014/05/Combating-chemo-mouth-experts-offer-tips.html I've cut out everything with artificial sweeteners in - diet drinks, yogurts etc as they seem to make things worse, and have gone back to (low) sugar varieties, lol. And drink gallons, OK litres, of water...... Best wishes,",

The flavour I picked was just because it was something I'd never had in a toothpast.  Hi Jim, That sounds interesting, love fennel/aniseed flavour. What brand/where did you buy it? Might try something aniseed flavoured to eat first to make sure it still tastes OK before I go ahead and buy it though! Best wishes, Jan",

I had 4 nodes affected, strongly ER+ and am older than you at 64, but you may have just to think that you could be one of those 3 extra women that survive. I've just had 3 cycles of FEC chemo, which was easier than I expected luckily with few side-effects, and another 3 Taxol to go, but if you found the chemo too hard, maybe they could stop it as you have such a high benefit already. It is good to try and have as much info as you can, so you can be comfortable with your decision. If your onco has said go ahead, well that is his expert opinion, and I'd be persuaded by that. Good luck, Jan",

But she lived until she was 96, dying from something unconnected. She played tennis once or twice weekly all her life till she was about 75, had a sherry, or two, at 5pm every day, later it was whisky. So did one trade off the other????? Best to all, Jan xx",

I have to say it was much easier than I expected and I'm recovering well. Did they say if the biopsy that showed you have lobular carcinoma, also showed if you are oestrogen positive or negative (ER+ or -), HER2 Positive or negative, or Triple negative? All these can have a factor in whether you might need chemo or radiotherapy afterwards or not. Did they actually say you might need these? I was diagnosed grade 2 and am ER+, HER2-, and my lymph node ultrasound looked clear which is why they only said I needed a mastectomy with SNB.  If it had looked like your nodes could be affected already, you would probably have had an extra underarm node biopsy as well, and then they may have sald you might need full node clearance. However if they are only saying you need SNB that is good, and it is an extra precaution they take to make sure. It is all very confusing to start with I know, so feel free to ask as many questions as you like on here, and I am sure others will be able to advise you too. Best wishes",
