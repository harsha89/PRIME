      "Content": "Hi was wandering if anyone else has had a spacer inserted after mastectomy and if it caused your breast to swell. I had my surgery in May and a couple of weeks later I went to get it checked as my breast had gotten bigger. They said it was fine and probably just fluid. It has happened again and I'm not sure if it's due to swimming and going to the gym which I just started a couple of weeks ago. It is a lot bigger than the other one. Also I was supposed to go back to hospital for it to be filled up but never ever needed to as it was same size as my other. I find this strange. Any advice would be grateful   Thanks. X ",

One from the muscles from my back and the other is getting a spacer in as they don't want to do both at same time. I've been fine until now. Think the nerves are kicking in a bit as I go in tomorrow. Don't like leaving my daughters either. Just keep thinking it's another step forward to getting rid of this horrible disease. I was told to get back fastening bras and extenders. Probably best asking your bn as the surgeons are all different. Was good to read all the tips from everyone that's been through it.  Wishing you all best. X ",

I'm actually recovering in hospital just now after having a double mastectomy on Thursday with immediate reconstruction on one side using the muscle from my back and a spacer in the other as they thought it was too risky to do both at same time. Pleased with results, just means my journey is going to be longer as I will have to wait at least 6 months before I get the next one done. That's good to hear your cancer free.

      "Content": "Emmie76 Hi everyone my name is Emma and I'm 41 married with 6 kids although 3 are adults now. I have had a lump in my right armpit directly next to my breast as apposed to deep inside my armpit. I finally went to my appointment with my GP after cancelling 3 previous appointments think the lump would go away. I have been suffering with all over breast pain but no pain in the lump which is about the size of a grape. My GP referred me to the breast clinic and my appointment is Wednesday. Has anyone else here had cancer diagnosed from an armpit/underarm lump? Will I have a biopsy the same day? And how long does it take for the results? And should I insist on a biopsy even if they think the lump isn't suspicious? (I have read too many stories of ladies being told the lump isn't expected to be cancer only to be told after a biopsy that it is indeed cancer). I'm trying not to worry but have a very strange feeling about it and I'm not sure if I've talked myself into believing it's going to be bad news or if this is a genuine 'sense or instinct' that something is very wrong Emma x   Hi  Emma,  I was exactly the same as you. Found a lump under my arm. Unlike yours mine was high up and you could only feel it certain ways I sat. Went to the Dr's and they referred me to the breast clinic. I was in an awful state and couldn't wait so came home and went on line to see if anyone would take me that day for a mammogram and ultrasound private. Mammogram showed cysts but ultrasound showed a slight lump in my breast. I then was referred back to the nhs and had to wait 2 weeks for biopsy. Was the longest 2 weeks ever. Didn't expect to get told it was breast cancer before I even got the biopsy. I thought my world had ended. I have came through all treatment and operations. I don't want to scare you as yours could be nothing but if it is cancer you will get through it. Hope all goes well.  Kerry. X ",

      "Content": "Emmie76 Thank you all so much for the support over the last few days. My news is fabulous and I'm happy to report that after initially reporting to the worst consultant I've ever visited I was sent from his clinic to the breast clinic who took over and did the mammo and ultrasound scan who gave me the all clear. Such lovely nurse and doctor compared to the more morbid one I had to report to first, actually took the time to hear how I ended up there, what I had been feeling and the changes etc. They are 99% certain it's a fatty lump and he was there a good while making sure! Showed my mammo results to me and explained everything, no biopsy needed and I came away feeling a huge weight off my shoulders. Breast pain is still unexplained however. I don't have dense breasts, but I suppose I could be going through menopause. He did say to report to my GP immediately in the future and to keep an eye on myself for any changes. Next time I'll be asking to see a different initial consultant. He was very dismissive, didn't ask about family history or even check my left side.... very naughty. Just a good job I was treated like I was the only patient they had today in the BC. Sorry for the late reply but I had all my crazy lot over for dinner and wine. They had no idea why I was so happy, especially in comparison to what I could've been calling them about! I hope I did the right thing with not having the biopsy? I'm certain that he would've done it should the lump of been suspicious. I feel my mind has been put at rest now anyway. I wish you all lots of love for the future and a fast recovery.   Just seen this. That's great news , I'm so happy for you.",
