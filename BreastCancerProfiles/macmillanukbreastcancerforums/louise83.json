    "Content": "Hey,  I know exactly how your feeling... I had an appointment at breast clinic last Thursday as I found a lump and go referred me as my sister has had breast cancer. The breast surgeon said it just felt like fatty tissue and that she will send me for ultrasound as precaution but she was certain it would be nothing. I am to young for a mammogram they said. I had the ultrasound and the radiographer said she could see a 1 cm mass and was going to do a biopsy there and then was so scary. Went back to the breast surgeon and she said that they can't tell if if it's sinister or not but the shape of mass is a concern and they would call when results are in. It has been the most awful week of my life, I just keep thinking the worst.  They called today and I have an appointment this wedsnesday ,so I have to wait another 2 days for results. Like you say, I just want to know now either way so I can deal with it. I hope that you get good news",
