      "Content": "I got them prescribed by my GP at the end of September. I think some won't prescribe due to costs but mine said she wouldn't get her knuckles rapped too badly for precribing. I am now 13 rads down with 6 to go and my skin is fine. I would add tho that the r2-the moisturising part-you are supposed to apply 3-4 times per day however you can only do this if you only use 1 sachet per application. I use about 5 as I'm getting breast and chest wall so I just use the cream at bedtime and supplement with other moisturiser. Therefore I couldn't in all honesty say that my current skin condition is down to the r1/r2. ",

I'm triple negative too but still in the midst of chemo so not had operation yet. I had same issue with steroids tho -they make me want to sleep!! I'm sure the other lovely ladies on here who are further ahead than me can offer better words of encouragement but I couldn't not say anything after reading your story.  Hopefully you are now through the worst and things will start getting better. ",

      "Content": "Not mad at all! I had got the job of my dreams last year and was really enjoying it, working from home 37.5 hours a week. This Feb I was diagnosed and started chemo in march, a year after getting dream job. They have been great and like you I worked as much as I could through chemobut had a good 6 weeks off following operation. I had decided before chemo tho that after all this I was definately reducing my hours. I am now working 3 days over 5 which means I have time for work, for me and most importantly my 5 year old. I just turned 41 a couple weeks ago.  I can always up my hours at work as the years go on.  I wanted a break really, I've been working since I was 16 and for all I know I might not reach retirement (I know we're not supposed to think that way and I'm a very positive person but it did enter into my decision making) so I this felt right for me. You could always ask your work and see how it goes? ",
