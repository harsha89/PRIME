      "Content": "Our practice had 3 GPs when we first registered and now has 8. You dont always see the same GP although if you have a preference you can ask for one in particular.What I have noticed though is that a new face is sometimes a good thing, I went along to see my GP and was told to give things time and they may improve! On going back I saw a new GP who immediatly referred me to the local hospital for tests. I have to say that so far our practice has been great. We live in a small village ( where everyone knows everyone else) I have had super care from all involved - GPs , District Nurses ( my new family), Gps receptionists and chemist. Saying thank you just isnt enough. Jules",

      "Content": "Hi Annya I had 4 cycles of Epi and am almost finished the CMF. I was to have 4 cycles of the stuff( day 1 and day 8) in effect 8 doses. I have 3 doses to go , thank god. The next one , day 8 , on Friday. That means 1 cycle to go. Tomorrow I go to make my appointment for radiotherapy which starts about March, all going well. I have had food fads especially for pork pies! My hubby keeps me going on them. I find fresh orange juice quenchies my thirst but need to watch how much I drink. My district nurse suggested pineapple juice might help and it did.I will give the cranberry a try too.Good luck with ypur treatment Jules x",

      "Content": "Hi Tracy, I just returned to work last week after being off for a year and like you underwent surgery, chemo and radiotherapy. I feel good , however I am beginning to realise I still have a way to go to regain some of my strength and energy. I have always had problems with my back although until a couple of weeks ago it had been fine. Now it is playing up and I have gone to the chiropracter who helped me before. I cant really give you any advice but know you are not alone. I guess we just have to be patient with ourselves although I know that can be hard.Best wishes Jules x",

      "Content": "Hi Jazz I was told about 3/4 weeks after my last chemo in order to allow my bloods to recover and to let my body recharge.I start RT on the 24 March every day for 5 weeks. I had originally planned to return to work part time but was advised to wait as I my find myself getting tired with the treatement and more so the traveling. I have all my dates in for the RT and go this coming week to get marked etc. The first 4 weeks I have to go in the morning for treatment , then in the afternoon on the last week. I have asked to use the volunteer drivers to come and go to the hospital and know that I could end up leaving early morning and returning later in the afternoon as there are always a few people taken at the same time. Goodluck with your treatment, let us know how you are getting on, best wishes Jules x",

      "Content": "Hi Janet the hot flushes are a pain. I looked on Amazon for the chillow pillow and read different comments on them, both good and bad. One woman writes that the pillow didnt stay cool ,long enough for her.Instead she bought a rubberised camping pillow ( 2.99) a sml funnel (99p) , filled it with water and it kept cold for 8 hrs! Total cost 3.98! Haven't tried it myself but sounds a good idea! Have thought about buying a childs water filled style pillow toy and putting it in the fridge/ freezer to see if it works - who knows?! Good luck Julesx",
