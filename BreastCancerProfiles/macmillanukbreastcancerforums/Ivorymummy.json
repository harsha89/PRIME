      "Content": "hi everyone, i am very new to this site (and to the whole notion of breast cancer!) Was diagnosed last week and in for pre-op tomorrow and lumpectomy on 18th. I am trying to keep things as normal as possible, especially for my little boy (8) as i am a single parent with no family nearby. Sounds a silly thing to worry about but we have a holiday booked for end July which will be 5 weeks after surgery. I'm damned if my son is going to miss out on his holiday, but i am also aware that i am due to start radiotherapy around then. will we be allowed to go do you think? thanks all.",
