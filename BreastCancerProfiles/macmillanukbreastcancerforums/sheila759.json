      "Content": "Hi All new to this so I hope I am doing this right. I have just found out I have Grade 3 Invasive ductal cancer I had a Lumpectomy with clear margins.But 3 Lymph Nodes had cancer one was attached to some tissue. I have ME and Fibromylgia so I am quite concerned about how Chemo and Radiotherapy will affect it. I feel very very frightened and think I am on the way out.  I will be starting Chemo in about 2 weeks time. My stomach churns all the time. I just don't know what to expect. Is it better to have Chemo through a Cannular or Picc line? How was anyone affected by chemo? Sorry for all the questions.  ",
