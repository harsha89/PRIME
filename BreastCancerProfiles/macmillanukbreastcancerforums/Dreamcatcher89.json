      "Content": "Hi I was wondering if anyone could help. My mum was diagnosed with breast cancer, since then she has had her whole breast removed including her nipple as that carried cancer cells.she had an implant put in place and shes healed really nicely. Today she was hoping to find out when she can start chemo to be told she can not have the chemo as her heart rate is low. The cancer shes been diagnosed with is her2 positive. She's been feeling tired and sometime shortness of breath and very light headed and wobbly and also has shooting pains sometime in her chest. She has been told she has to wait up to 6weeks to been seen to see what is causing her heart rate being so low. I am really scared something is going to happen to my mum she's only 45 years old and really healthy",

      "Content": "Hi hi Thank you for your reply. She is ment to be having the herceptin but can't at the moment with her heart rate being so slow but could that be from the operation that it went down? I am not sure when she had the mammogram done but she got the results back today. The lady who use to see my mum always pushed for my mum to have chemo and then the next time she saw her she only said hello she wasn't pushing for the chemo any more as I think she knew my mum's heart rate was really low. Is there anything that could help with bringing her heart rate back up like foods? I am sorry to hear that you have the same as my mum as I have hurd it's one of the worst you can get thank you for taking your time out to reply back to me x",

      "Content": "Hi lesleyhelen I went to see her last night as I don't live with my parents as I have my own family. When I spoke to her she told me that they said they will not be treating her as she has a heart condition. She wasn't told what was causing it just that 40% of blood is stuck in the heart and that it's not travelling around the body like it should. He gave her a prescription of tamoxifen which she said she will not take and the thing is she won't. I havnt told her what I or my brother or sister's think or how we feel. I am more scared they are not doing nothing for her she had the biopsy done 4-5weeks after the nipple removal. Could the implant cause a little blockage? I am trying to find everything I can to try and help her. She cried saying she went through all this for nothing and it really broke me I stayed strong as I don't want her seeing me crumble I just don't know what 2 do x",

      "Content": "Thank you for your reply. I am sorry for your loss and how much you have been through. My mum can be really stubborn at times. The hospital have gave Â her a scription for some medicine for her heart rate but she hasn't collected it as it causes the menopause and she don't want to go through that at her age. She can't have the chemo till her heart rate is back up but I think I will do what u said if she has a dizzy spell or anything unusual then call the doctors so she can be seen. I hope your feeling well and again sorry I know it's stupid but I really don't know what to say and I have never gone through any of what you have I dread what people go through with cancer. X",
