    "Content": "Hi Janice, I was diagnosed on Jan 8th and booked in for my op on 21st, very quick !! I had a stratis rec, I woke up and had a peek and thought they hadnt done the op it looked so natural, it has a scar across the breast and no nipple as yet but Im happy with it. I had a grade 3 invasive so Im lucky they found it so early on. The stratis is only suitable if you have small boobs- finally a bonus ha ha ....Ill have an implant in the other one and the nipple put on later.... Im starting chemo on Wed this week. In between Ive managed a cool city break in London and a trip to The lakes....Im now busy looking at what I should eat to stay as healthy as possible and rightly or wrongly carrying on pretty much as usual, I do have my odd down times but hey....always been one of those carry on regardless types, my main thing is not knowing how sick Im going to be but guess Ill know soon enough :)",
