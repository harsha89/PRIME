    "Content": "Hi Janet and other members of this group. This is the first time that I have posted anything since being diagnosed in December and I too thought (or rather convinced myself) that I had a cyst.  I remember waking up to the adrenaline filled realisation of it all, but pleased be assured that this will pass as your mind and body have had a huge shock and need to process what's happening.  We all cope in different ways, and family, friends and faith have been my rocks in this journey so far. Take one day at a time Janet and try to continue to do the things that you enjoy. Sending big hugs xxxx",
