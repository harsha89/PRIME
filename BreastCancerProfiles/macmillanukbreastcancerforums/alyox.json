      "Content": "Hi Katherine, Thanks for your reply.  Will try to get I removed before rads or failing that before we leave France. We are in Saone st Loire (small village, Frangy en Bresse).  Have been in France for 20 years but taken the decision to move back as missing family and parents not getting any younger, needing more support. How about you? Whereabouts are you based? Good luck for Monday.",

      "Content": "Hello ladies, I have just finished my chemo this week (FEC-T) and start my rads on 12 th November.  I am living in France but moving back to the UK in February. Over here they recommend leaving the portacath in situ for 2-3 years as standard in case of recurrence but I wondered what the protocol is in the UK?  Psychologically I would like to get it removed asap (plus it ruins the line of my clothes!). If I get it removed here,  would it be easy to have another one put in should I have a recurrence once I am back in the UK as it was really practical. Can anyone help/advise? Thanks.",

      "Content": " Hello ladies, Following WLE, chemo and radiotherapy (finished 19th December), I started taking Tamoxifen last Monday and on top of the worsening hot flushes and night sweats (which I have had since starting chemo), I am now noticing bruises on my arms and legs, with new bruises appearing every day without any obvious cause (no bumps or falls). They are not painful but I'm wondering if anyone has had a similar experience and can advise?  Should I wait and see if things improve or contact my GP?  Grateful for any feedback as I was very apprehensive about starting the Tamoxifen in the first place and may be stressing unnecessarily about every symptom. Alyson  ",
