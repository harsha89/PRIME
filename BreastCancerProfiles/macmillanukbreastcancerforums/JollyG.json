Update for me is that lenny was removed on monday and i got home yesterday.  Scar line looks as neat and tidy as it can at this stage and I'm not in too much discomfort considering. I go back a week tomorrow to find out  the results of lenny. At this stage glad lenny has gone and hoping he's not going to cause any more trouble down the line. Must go and do 2nd lot of todays exercises whilst i remember.  Hope all is ok currently with you all. JG",

I suspect that reasoning may be because I don't tend to carry a lot of spare stuff around with me and I'm pretty active/sporty, which was one of my reasons for not going ahead with it anyway, I don't fancy having extra muscle weaknesses from tissue based recons. I'm happy with my decision, I got to see prosthetics hands on too, so that was good. Hopefully it'll be the right decision but who really knows until you've gone through surgery. Question, did you ever get any pain in your PT? I get some, usually mild enough that it only annoys me in the background rather than really gets to me, but I was getting more shooting pains right through it earlier today mainly in the nipple area, which were a little bit more nippy ( i think I tend to have a reasonable pain threshold so find it hard to describe pain intensity sometimes) More often I get itching, because the skin is so stretched, and a burning, like sunburn/heartburn type pain.",

RT hasn't been mentioned yet in my case, but I assume they get a clearer picture when they remove my lump and look at it in closer detail. They'll have plenty to look at! How did you find the RT? I hope your outcome after the last batch of treatment is good. I'm quite small, so i'm leaning towards no reconstruction, as the thought of lots of surgeries does not appeal, I'd probably also have to have the 'good' side done too to match them up as a reconstruct would be far perkier, and I'm not going to be missing much from my natural size anyway. The thought of having to repeat it every 10 or so yrs for replacements doesn't wholly appeal either. Think I'm as sorted as I can be currently in my head with it all, just the nervous wait for dates, and the unknown of how it will go in the end. I'm convinced it has grown again even since last week when I was last at hospital. FX for you too.",

Come end of Aug start Sept, I had a larger mass and a rapidly larger breast than the other one and went back to GP. Had referral appoint at hosp a few weeks ago where I was scanned and then had a CB, including lymph nodes, I could tell by radiologist and the fact consultant did a biopsy there and then in their office that something was a miss. Results then came back as a borderline PT, plan is due to size of PT and breast size I'm looking at a mastectomy. I go back this week to discuss reconstruction options and to look at dates for surgery. Good to hear you're feeling well after treatment. Do you mind me asking if you're going to have a reconstruction or not? I think I've almost decided which way I'll go, but need to check a few more questions at appointment later this week first.",

Just hope the tiredness keeps at bay as much as possible.",

      "Content": "Jacmatholmad aw nightmare, fx you don't need to go through planning again!  I've just had zap no 10...double figures already, only 5 more to go. Review today was fine, skin red, no surprises there, but still holding up, being good at cream application hopefully will pay off, even on monday when i went to bed super early as head was exploding due to headache from hell, i somehow managed to still do my bedtime application, even though last thing i wanted to do. I'm not too tired currently, maybe a teeny bit more due to cold, but not anything i would class as rt related, guess it could hit anytime though, still managing to work so all good, but only doing mornings at mo anyway so that is probably helping. Seems the carpark wardens know me now too after a week and a half and a bit of banter with one of them yesterday, got a more personal welcome today, no more showing my appointment letter pass, every little helps with the mundaneness of travelling in each day, or maybe I'm just easily pleased. Lo.",

      "Content": "Intersting Lgilly  seeing as we are being treated in same place. I got told just to use a roll on deodorant, which is what i use anyway, never got told it had to be a specfic one. I've been flipping between my usual one and biosen anyway. Just water when showering was mentioned, but was also told could use shower gel like simple, that was fragrance free and mild. Did you get a leaflet when you were given your creams? Only 4 zaps left to go, time has gone quickly. Today has been the first day i didn't really want to drag myself in, but think that's because it's not been my usual daily routine today as no work this morning, and was geting lots of sinus headaches this morning so just wanted to curl up on sofa and not move.",

      "Content": "I've not used it for lymph purposes but i use keisio tape a lot for sports related stuff, and it does do the job for what I've used it for in the past, really interested to hear about its uses for lymph drainage, could come in handy. I myself would persevere with it. As sally says you can trim off any peeling parts, and it will normally stay on with showering etc so should last a few days if not a week.",

      "Content": "Louise I've only just had a MX without recon last month and no chemo, so not as far down line as you, but I'm also slender, so I can relate to the only feeling ribs and uncomfortable to lie on that side, in fact no where near trying that side at all, I've only just progressed from my back to my non operated side at night for sleeping. I have some firmness in my armpit area, and of course the skin is tight too in places, but \\I find that if I don't do enough of my exercises each day it soon tightens up again, I was told to keep doing my exercises for a number of months past the general 6 week post op period. I see you say that you're having physio in the armpit, is that for the tightness or for something else like cording if you also had nodes removed? What has your BCN or Dr said? For me I expect the chest area to always feel firm, due to the fact there is little underlying tissue there than there once was other than muscle, so feeling ribs is a given i reckon. Everyone also heals differently, so don't feel too disheartened if it's taking longer than you'd think, especially if you're having CT, your body has been through a lot, and still will be with the treatment.",
