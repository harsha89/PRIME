      "Content": "Hi, this is my first time here, first post. My diagnosis was confirmed last week, finalising treatment plan within a few days. Didn't have symptoms, but picked up by screening. At times I feel short of breath, just wondered if anyone else had felt the same? Can't find any online links to BC and shortness of breath. Grateful for advice. Thanks.",

      "Content": "Had official confirmation now - 2 tumours, one multifocal with 3 lesions, grade 1 invasive ductal carcinoma. Second tumour grade 1 tubular lobular carcinoma. One sentinel lymph node positive. Will need adjuvant FEC-D chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy to the breast and the axilla. If MRI scan shows further lesion, will need a masectomy. I've looked some of it up online but end up even more confused. Still don't know the stage. Anyone else here had 2 tumours at the same time? I have to focus more on the lymph node spread, and what the MRI scan shows, but have felt worried about the fact I managed to get 2 tumours at the same time.",

      "Content": "Had my operation results today. Not good. One of the lymph glands is cancerous, instead of one lump, there was 4. 3 so close together they looked like one, and another. Biggest is 16mm, so suppose that's not too bad. All Grade 1. Have to have chemotherapy and MRI scan. Very emotional/upset/scared tonight. The surgeon kept saying they've removed the cancerous lumps, but it's the spread to the lymph glands that's scared me.",

      "Content": "Another query, not medical, more emotional. My GP said I'd find some people would blank me, and it's happened, someone I thought was a very good friend has sent me one e-mail a few months ago, and not responded since. She told another friend she'd called me, she hasn't. I suspect if she sees me first, she'll make sure I don't see her. If we meet face to face, which it's possible, I'm not sure how I'd react. Anyone else had this kind of experience? It's sad, because come what may, the friendship's effectively over now, and some people who have been more in the acquaintance than friend camp, have been so thoughtful.",

      "Content": "Can so relate to these words regarding 'friends'. I too have experienced more help from people who are in the acquaintance category than a few so called friends. To be fair though, many friends have been great. Even one of my mom's friends who I've never met sent me some flowers, which was really kind. In addition to the emotional roller-coaster ride, like others, I'm finding out a lot about human nature.",
