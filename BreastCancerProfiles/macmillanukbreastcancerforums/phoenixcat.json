    "Content": "I have been on Arimidex for 2 months and I have had some pain and numbness in my right thigh, my surgeon and oncologist both said this was not caused by the medication, the pain is now less severe but I still have a certain amount of numbness , so not sure of the reason.  I will be taking them in any case as it gives you much greater protection against other tumours developing, Hope this helps, Jude    ",
