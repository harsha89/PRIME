      "Content": "Hi Sal Good to hear from you! Since I posted last I have taken the plunge and come off the tamoxifen,currently trying to conceive! After alot of thought and 'what if's I decided to go for it. I had been on tamoxifen for 2 years in June,like I say,my oncologist was happy for me to have a break for a while after being on it for 2 years,and assured me I am at no greater risk by having a break,to try for a few months.Plus Im now 38,so havent got too many years to think about it! If there were any doubts/chance of increased risk at all ,I know she wouldnt have allowed it and I certainly wouldnt have done it,and thats why I made the choice in the end,shes the expert! I expected to have a few anxious times after coming off it, but ,so far Im still feeling good about being off the tam,although hopefully can conceive soon if its meant to be so that I can get back to the tamoxifen.Im also on it for 10 years,so will have 8 years left! What will be will be! Good luck in whichever direction you turn,keep me posted,and Im here if you want to get in touch anytime Emma x",

      "Content": "Hi Yasmin I wasn't successful enough to concieveÂ  during my time off the tamoxifen unfortunately... I was off it for 8 months and was referred to the fertility unit during this time,after running some basic fertility tests ,they picked up in my bloods that I now have an under active thyroid and this is quite possibly the reason why I haven't caught pregnant.. I made the decision literally last week to get back on my tamoxifen as I was anxious of the time I was off it plus they were not happy for me to be off it for too much longer. I'm trying to come to terms with it,but find it difficult,but guess I need to allow some time,I have one child age 15 from a previous partner,but would have loved a child with my husband who has no children,but decision was made to ' call it a day'. I worry and get so anxious about everything. For yourself I would say to be positive, and take every opportunity that your offered,you are younger than me too so you have more time on your hands to concieve which helps. I always spend too much time thinking of the 'what if's' but so glad I came off the tamoxifen to try,at least I can't regret not doing so. I had so many scenario's in my head about the possibility of IVF etc but did not expect the result to be what it was,so I would just go with whatever you can at the time and see how it goes. I wish you all the success and am here if you want to talk about anything further. Emma x",

      "Content": "Hello, I've been taking tamoxifen for 2 years and thinking about coming off it to try for a baby. I was diagnosed 2 years ago at the age of 35.I had no chemo just radiotherapy treatment. I've spoken to the oncologist who has explained she is happy for me to come off the tamoxifen to try. I am frightened to death that the cancer will return if I stop the tamoxifen,even though I have been told I am at no greater risk if I have a break from it. Im worrying myself about it and thinking' what if' about every scenario. Just wondered if anyone else has felt this way or is in the same situation?If so how did you overcome your thoughts/fears,hopefully I can get some reassurance. Thankyou",
