    "Content": "Hi guys I am new to this. My mum was diagnosed with Breast Cancer on 23rd November 2018 and had Stage 1. She now has to go through Chemotherapy which frightens me as my mum is never ill. My Dad died of Stomach Cancer nearly 4 years ago which still hurts. Being strong is hard but I will be there for Mum. I have been told that there are bad side effects which frightens me.",
