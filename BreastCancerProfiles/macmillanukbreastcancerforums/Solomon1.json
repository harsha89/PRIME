      "Content": "So sorry you are experiencing mouth pain , I had same treatment and found drinking lots and lots of cold water really helped to flush my system , I kept 2 jugs permanently in the fridge so I didn't run out , never got on with the mouth products prescribed but found Plax sensitive comes in a pink bottle really helped rinsing after each meal . It is gruelling but your mouth will recover . Hope this helps , stay strong  Lucy xxx",

      "Content": "Hi Sarah, So sorry to hear of your diagnosis ,  I had same diagnosis 2 and a half years ago, it is a scary time but my three children at the time aged 6, 13 and 15 turned out to be a brilliant support .  I would say it was the hardest thing to tell them , but take day by day be open and keep them involved . My older two understood more than the six year old , but after my op when I started my Chemo we started a star chart for every treatment , my little girl loved to help me on return from the hospital . Take time for cuddles, there will be lots of tears along the way but you I am sure will come out stronger as a family at the end . Family , friends and school /nursery are a good help but don't be afraid to have a few wobbles along the way , I went from numbness , to anger before acceptance . Stay strong you can do it !! Lucyxxxx",
