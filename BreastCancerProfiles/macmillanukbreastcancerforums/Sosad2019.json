      "Content": "AHi everyone.  This is my first post. I have put it off for weeks and even put off creating an account because I didn\u2019t want this all to be real.  My mum found a lump in her left breast over Christmas. After a mammogram and biopsy we were told it was 2cm and grade 2 with 1 lymph node infected. Fast forward a month she had a lumpectomy and we had to wait 3.5 weeks for the results. Turns out the tumor was 3cm (and the surgeon got good 3cm margin around the tumor) but imfound it to be 3cm not 2cm, and grade 3 not grade 2 and 6 lymph nodes were infected not 1 as originally thought. (They took all 18 nodes out. 6 closest to the tumor were cancer)  She has invasive ductal cancer  estrogen positive and her2negative  They said that Mum needs a CT and full body PET scan to check to see if it spread. They will be Thursday and Friday this week and then results are another week after   I am so worried about her I live Abroad.. My Dad isn\u2019t around and she has my sister who lives 5 hours away who is able to come up to support my Mum  I\u2019ll go back for her chemo in a few weeks. Today my sister said it was a bad day for mum.  Have any of you had similar experiences?  What can I do to help? What questions can I ask the dr\u2019s?  Is it normal for it all to take so long? should I look at going private? Would that be faster or would it help? will she be okay?  WHat should we expect? I\u2019m  so sorry for all these questions. In all my life I have never seen my mum have so much as a cold  she is only just turned 60  I hate that she is going through all this   any advice would be appreciated   thank you",

      "Content": "Thank you for replying to me. I\u2019m just so worried about her. She tried to go to a support group but there was just two elderly ladies and she didn\u2019t stay. I think she was looking for someone who was a similar age. She doesn\u2019t want to go back to the hospital for the nhs psychologist because it\u2019s too upsetting for her to go back to the hospital when she doesn\u2019t actually have to go there. I\u2019m praying for good news ",

      "Content": "Hi Sue Thank younfor your kind words. I truly hope these scans come back clear. The alternative doesn\u2019t bare thinking about.  I don\u2019t think my Mum can do anything right now. My sister is keeping her busy but she is just overwhelmed and worried so much. She has never taken anything other than ibruprofren in her life and even then at a push. She has always been so happy and tells me not to worry. She is positive and I can confidently say the happiest and most lovely person in the world. This diagnosis csme out of the blue and has completely floored her.  THank you again for taking the time to reply. ",
