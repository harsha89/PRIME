      "Content": "Hi I don't know if I will help but I was diagnosed in July 2016 and I though my world was coming to an end.  I'm sure people can't imagine what its like to hear those words until it happens. I drove myself mad, constantly googling, asking various different family if they thought it would come back, and like you this monster was there all the time, in fact, I had awful dreams. I constantly burst into tears and cried so much, I just couldn't cry anymore. I was also ER+ positive but stage one, no lymph node activity but grade 2 (I think) and I cried again. I had to have chemo, Herceptin, radiotherapy and no one could console me. Then I thought - what can I do about it? I eat healthy as they suggested, I created a regime every morning, do my nails to stop them from turning yellow, rinse my mouth in salt water, make sure I use plenty of moisturiser, drink plenty of water, on my exercise bike for 20 25 minutes every morning. Went work full time ( only chemo days off and a couple more when I was three months in) its now April and just over 8 months on. It gets better, it never leaves your mind, but I am now researching the properties of aspirin and cannabis oil. I hate the word positive, I really do, I felt if one more person said to be \"stay positive\" I would have poked their eyes out. Upbeat! I'm feeling better, I don't google anymore, it won't help you, research into some of the stuff which can help. My GP tells me if you are going to have to have a cancer, breast is one of the best to have, they have come on leaps and bounds and the success rate is really good. Stay upbeat.  if you ever want to talk let me know. Caitlin",

      "Content": "Hello Carolyn Wow, 18 round of Herceptin.   I have to do 12 month of and injection plus 6 rounds of chemo. I am a self employed Financial Controller and work in an office, there are no children and I can do some work at home if needs be. I have done some research and understand that plenty of fluid and exercise can help, I can only say I am quite responsive to anti emetics as for anything else.  I just don't yet know.  I don't have any partners and my worry isn't the money, but losing the contracts. I need to at least retain one. Luckily (?) if I start sept 14th  at least it will be 3 months as I will finish around 20th December for two weeks and then that will be almost my last chemo blast - Im crossing my fingers. Any help would be appreciated Regards Caitlin Regards Caitlin",

      "Content": "Hello Kat40  I'm not in the same boat as you, but I really smiled when I read your tumour had responded well and you were going for your first mamogram, I really hope its clear.  I am searching the site for discussions being very new to it as I have only recently been diagnosed with a stage 1 grade 3 smallish tumour in the breast.  I am due to start chemo and herceptin and am so very very scared, mainly about whether I can work as I am self employed and cannot wait to be in your position of going for my first mammogram Caitlin50",

      "Content": "thanks Carolyn, I'm not sure how good/bad I'm going to be, I think I may work better at home.  I am struggling now with the emotional side, always thinking my cancer is getting worse, I have (I think) a mastitis infection but it has turned into Inflammatory breast cancer in my head as I have read the symptoms.  I have driven the hospital mad, my husband has said all the surgery, biopsies and appointments I have had would not have let this get past them, but I can't get it out of my head and I'm doing my own head in. Work is the only thing which calms me down and makes me forget so now I panic I won't be able to do it. I have searched all over websites and forums to try a gauge if I'm going to be able to do and to hear I had to have Herceptin has hit me harder than I thought. I'm all over the place at the moment and am seriously getting fed up of feeling this way. Your mail has made me laugh especially the chemo brain, but I really want it to be okay. Caitlin :(",
