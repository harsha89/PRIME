      "Content": "hi, early last month my mother felt a lump in her right breast and went to see her gp, her doc found another lump under her armpit and referred her to a local hospital, things moved very quickly from there onwards as she had a biopsy and was told that both lumps were cancerous(they only measured 1.5cm and 1.75cm) grade 2 invasive , it was her choice to have a mastectomy and was told that she would have all of her lymph nodes removed, i personally was unhappy with the treatment and the staff at the hospital as my mum was told loads of things after her op that made her get her hopes up (apparently though the surgeon was spot on though)!! i.e she was told that she had only had one node removed as the surgeon felt that only this one was necessary, when in reality, the oncologist informed her today that they had all been stripped out!! there was loads of administritive errors regarding her oncologist appointment, even after surgery she found out from the consultant that she had been given the wrong chest drain (which wasnt emptied for 3 days!!) and also post op, she was stuck in a gynocology ward because of bed shortages in the cancer suite and the nurses there obviously werent trained to deal with breast cancer patients!! anway, im going to get off my soapbox now and ask for any advice on the current situation that she faces, at her oncologists appointment today, as well as being informed that she had a full lymph node removal (9 or ten i think)she was told that the surgeon could only find 1 lump and that was the one near her armpit, apparently the lump in her breast must have been dispersed during the initial biopsy!! the oncologist then went on to say that even though she had had a full lymph node removal, it was only the first node that had a hint of cancer and that she would need a 6 month course of chemo, the cancer was hormone receptive and the oncologist even went on to admit that no-ones knows, whether or not, chemo actually stops any stray cancerous cells from spreading!!! my dad on the other hand doesnt think that she should have the chemo and its just the doctors covering their own backs, so to speak. My mother is a very strong person and im just worried that she will side with my father and refuse the chemotherapy, they both have different views but i belive that its my mothers body and that its up to her to decide, i am worried sick of the thoughts of her having chemotherapy but i know it would be for the best.... i know nothing about chemotherapy and am wondering, what are the side effect?? can it kill a person?? i understand that im rambling on but i still cant belive that my mum had got cancer and im worrying myself into a bad state of health :(",
