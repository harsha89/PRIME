      "Content": "I had a grade 3 stage 1 tumour (invasive ductal)which was 17mm. My cancer is avery aggressive form which is more likely to reccur within 5 years and is not responsive to hormones so chemo/radiotherapy is my only option. I felt I had to have chemo just to mop up any stray cells that may be lurking. I have 2 young children and felt it was important to give myself everychance to make sure I stay clear. I begin my chemo this week, and am very apprehensive but feel I have to go through it. Its 4 months out of my life, not long really in the great scheme of things and if it means I stay cancer free then I feel its my only choice. I know some peolpe choose not to go through it, everyone is different, I have put my trust in my oncologist and am going for it.I have many friends who are on standby to help out with the kids while I am unwell. Good luck whatever you decide to do. No one wants to be on this journey and all of us will taek a different path for a variety of reasons. All the bestÂ  xxx",

But since my second dose a week ago both my eyelids are doing it. It's really annoying and compleletly beyond my control. Hope it goes away when I finish! Anyone else had this? Kim xxx",

Not sure whether it was acoincidence, but the next day I had the most horrendous diarrhea, was quite concerned after about the sixth lot!!! But I took an immodium and it stopped.

Don't misunderstand me, I am so grateful for all the care I have had, but I am wondering if I should have asked for a double mascetomy. I know that TNBC is more likely to recur within 5 yearsand if I have a double mascetomy I am giving myself a better chance.I am just about to begin my chemo, so will wait until afterwards. I am only in my mid 40s with 2 children.Anyone else find themselves in this situation.?",

I underwent a lumpectomy and sentinal node biopsy a week later, luckily all the tumour has been removed and no cancer was found in my lymph nodes. I face 6 months of chemo soon followed by radiotherapy. I can see that I have been very lucky as it was caught early, but I now am beginning to feel very depressed. I got myself through christmas, visiting my family about 200 miles away which was lovely. Then New Year back at home with my husband and 2 children. They are all back at school this week and I am left at home with my thoughts! I feel sick at the moment , due to anxiety but my mind is in overdrive, could it be stomach cancer? N, o of course not, but then I didn't think I would get it in my breast!! My emotions seem to veer from manic activity, chatting happily, keeping busy etc to the depths of despair thinking the worst all the time. I do have lots of support at home and through friends, but I can't really talk to them about how I really feel.My husband is holding the fort, but I can see the strain in his face, I daren't speak to him about how I feel as I don't want to add to his stress. Also need to keep happy for my 2 kids who are both under 11, they need me to be strong. I feel such guilt that I am unable to be the Mum they need. Thanks for listening!!!",

One day last week I took the maximum dose of 8 imodium to no avail! I was due to have my 3rd FEC today but it has been delayed so I can recover. The decision has been made to possibly abandon FEC and go on to the Docetaxel for 4 cycles instead of 3. I am absolutely petrified of having the same reaction to the drug as I had to the FEC, it s been so bad. I have lost so much weight and I was only just 9 stone to start with. Has anyone else had severe reactions like mine to FEC? And was the docetaxel better? Need some reassurance!!!!",
