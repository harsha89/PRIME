      "Content": "Hi Sue Thank you for your response. It was really helpful. I have done 7 courses of chemotherapy and what I can say is that it is not great but I found the first one was the worst. I actually have my last one tomorrow. Also I found that for every side effect there was a remedy so you can manage your symptoms quite well as long as you let your oncologist know what they are. I was traumatised when my hair was coming out but I learnt a trick. I got a really short cut and found that after I did that and continued to use the cold cap I never became bald which was an emotional boost for me. Just in case I did go bald I had hats and wigs at hand. I was scared more about the unknown but once I started I got used to the ordeal of doing this every three weeks and it did get better. I suppose it is sort of how I am feeling now because I suppose having a mastectomy is just very daunting and I worry if I go ahead with a lumpectomy if it comes back or is not cleared then I would feel it was my fault etc. I just wished they had been more open with me from the start and not tell me that I would do chemo first to shrink the tumour and after this happened they just dropped the bomb on me unexpectedly after I was doing all these scans which they never fully explained the results of. I do wish you the very best with the rest of your treatment. I am sure you will get through it. Best of luck   Fiona",

      "Content": "Jowan   I know our situation is different but I read some of the things you wrote and also saw glimpses of myself. I also massively changed my diet to try to control the situation and felt that I could get better or cure myself. I persisted with the chemotherapy treatment asap because I was scared it would spread to other places but the chemo honestly was not as bad and it does depend on the individual. It was not easy and the first course was the worst but in saying so I might have to do my last one tomorrow because despite being told that number 7 would be my last I discovered that the surgeon did not book my surgery as he said he would so now if when I meet tomorrow he cant do it in the next 5 weeks I have to do the number 8. It is frustrating. In reading what you have written it has given me some hope that I should not worry too much about whether I meet someone after all this because whoever it is will have to accept me for who I am or it is not worth it. Most of my friends are abroad and my family so it has been a real tough journey. They do ring me and support me from afar which is very helpful and does make a difference. Some friends here have disappeared or have not been around but for me the key thing is to keep going and after 7 courses of chemo with what my medical team told me was great response I just think I was hit hard when at first they told me I had two options and now out of the blue I only have one.   Thank you Jowan for sharing your story because even though it is different from mine I still found it very helpful and I could see glimpses of myself. I wish you the very best on your journey.   Fiona x    ",

      "Content": "I was diagnosed with breast cancer in January and I have done 7 courses of chemotherapy as my hospital decided to do neo adjuvant chemo to shrink the lump so that I could have a lumpectomy. I was motivated because I thought if I could save my breast then it would be worth the torture. Now after I have done all 7 courses out of the blue my surgeon tells me that they want me to do a mastectomy. I was in shock because each time I did a scan they would tell me that the response was brilliant etc. The tumour is now barely visible on the MRI scan and I cannot understand why they want me to do it because they have not given me a reason that I understand. I basically met with the surgeon three weeks ago to plan my surgery and because I was hit with the news unexpectedly I broke down crying and he had to put off the consultation until tomorrow. I am no where near making a decision because I don't know what to do. I am scared about pressing for a lumpectomy and having to deal with cancer coming back because I made the wrong decision. I am really stressed out and have been crying most of last week because of this consultation tomorrow. I just want to do the right thing but the medical team just have not told me why they have suddenly switch from what they told me at the start. The tumour shrank as was the intention of doing the chemo first. Another reason why I am a bit upset is that while I was doing the chemo my oncologist kept saying that the scans were showing remarkable results but she still thinks I should do a mastectomy and never said why. I just wish they had been open with me and not wait until the end of my treatment to hit me with the news and expected me to just plan a surgery date without any counselling or anything. I am stressed and confused and need some advice.",

      "Content": "Hello everyone. I just joined the site today and I think I must be doing something wrong. I was after advice but so far I have received none so I must be doing something wrong. I was after advice from other women who were in a similar situation or who had been in a similar dilemma. I have decisions to make about my surgery but wanted to hear from women who had to do the same. I am 35 years old and the thought of a mastectomy scares me. Obviously I want to do the right thing but also prefer to do  a lumpectomy if it is t all possible to get clear margins etc. Maybe starting a new discussion is not the way to go about getting advice? Could someone point me in the right direction if I am going about this the wrong way as I am a newbie? I just wanted to hear from other women who struggled with these decisions. I hope to get some response this time. :)",

      "Content": "Hi Chris Thank you so much for responding. I am sorry to hear that despite doing a lumpectomy and everything else you are still faced with doing another surgery. It is so difficult to comprehend that you got clear margins but they discovered a different type of cancer cells. I wish you all the best and keep fighting because you have come a long way. It does help just knowing about other people's experiences which is what I was after. I know all our experiences are different but we all share this disease in common and what it means to fight in our own way. I have my meeting with the surgeon tomorrow as I broke down in the first consultation. I just have so many thoughts running around in my head. I am 35, single, no children and was hoping to meet someone before this happened. I guess I am an emotional wreck and I have to focus on doing whatever I can to increase my chances but to be honest it is very hard. I am sure that we can all attest to that. In reading about your experience it makes me look at my situation in different ways which is very helpful. I guess sometimes I sit and think how awful it is to be going through what I am going through when they are so many who are going through similar or worse or have been through it all and survived! Thank you for taking time to respond to me. Best luck on your journey.     Fiona",

      "Content": "Thank you for your response. It does help to know about other experiences. I certainly would rather not have to go through this again but I was also told that having a mastectomy does not mean that cancer would not return. My cousin did a double mastectomy and her cancer returned. I do understand what you mean as the mastectomy might be best as it might lower the chances of recurrence.   I just want to go in the consultation more prepared than I was last time when I broke down in tears because I was so hopeful because the tumour had shrank. Breast cancer is so complex. As you mentioned you had a Grade 1 and I have a Grade 3 which is much more aggressive so I have to consider that. Thank you for responding and will definitely take that on board.   Fiona",
