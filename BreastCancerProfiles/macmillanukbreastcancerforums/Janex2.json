      "Content": "A year on I've finally decided to get some counselling as breast cancer is ruining my life. I'm angry I got it, I'm angry at the insensitive treatment I received. I was sent home after the biopsy with bruising the size of a melon which meant i had to wait 6 agonising weeks before they could operate. I didn't get a breast cancer nurse- it was felt i would benefit from seein a psychologist as the nurses seem to offer practical but not emotional advice. I shall slap anyone else who tells me to be positive , and that i was lucky to have a very small tumour and negative nodes so i didn't need the dreaded chemo. I anyone else angry? Jane",

      "Content": "Thanks for all the replies- the counsellor is brill- made me realise it was perfectly reasonable to be angry , and also that I wasn't listened to. i'm a GP and I know logically that I am at the better end of the spectrum but I am sick of being told how well i look and that i was lucky.V. down at the moment as I have follow-up next week and the last mammogram, when I still had the haematoma, was soooooooo painful",

      "Content": "Hi Carol Sorry to hear you are having such a rough time at the moment, but you will get through it! I can't help with the veins I'm afraid as so far (touch wood) I've had no problems. I guess it's because they only have one arm to use following node removal? Anyway, I'm sure the people who look after you will do what they can to make you as comfortable as possible. With regard to the hair loss, I actually found the falling out phase far more distressing than shaving the whole lot off! I think it's because you are taking control of the situation, instead of it controlling you - does that make sense? It was actually quite liberating. I personally didn't bother with my wig, and felt more comfortable in scarves and hats, but that really is a personal choice. I had my last chemo in November, and had to have a hair trim last week, once it starts to grow it really does go for it! I had 8 chemo's, 4 AC and 4 Taxotere. One thing you may have been told already, is that by some strange fluke hair usually starts to re-grow, albeit slowly, during the Taxotere treatment. One other piece of advice I would give you for when you do start Tax would be to paint your nails a really dark colour. Sometimes during this treatment nails can peel and even fall off, and I was very grateful to receive this advice as I had no problems whatsoever. Best of luck and try to stay positive - that's half the battle!",

      "Content": "Hello My name is Lisa and I am nearly 38. I was diagnosed with advanced breast cancer just over 9 years ago. I had a mastectomy, high dose chemo (through Hickman line) and approx 25 sessions of radiotherapy. Two years later I had breast reconstruction with complications - I contracted MRSA. A couple of years later I had problems with my heart and needed a mitral valve repair (possibly due to the chemo being cardio-toxic). I then discovered that I am a BRCA2 carrier so opted for a prophylactic mastectomy. A year later I gave birth to my first child (after being told I was probably infertile - due to the chemo). Two days ago I was diagnosed with secondaries in my sternum and rib. At the moment I am not sure what the treatment or prognosis will be but I would love to hear from anyone with any advice, ideas or suggestions. Lisa x",
