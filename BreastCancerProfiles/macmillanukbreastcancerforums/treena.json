Take care Keep strong Treena xxxx",

      "Content": "Hiya, just read your post,first off congratulations in completion of treatments.... i have the same thing with inlaws, although iv just finished chemo just starting radio......all through my treatments and op before that they always blanked it out, my father in law says because i look fine i am fine....its amazing how much make up and a smile can hide, iv heard from different people that it takes a good year or so for your body to get back to some normality, so listen to your body only you know how your feeling, if you want to have a rest, have a rest, until someone goes through all this they dont know how hard it is. Dont beat yourself up.....be honest with your family, that way they can support you more, Take care let me know how you get on Treena xxxxxxxx",
