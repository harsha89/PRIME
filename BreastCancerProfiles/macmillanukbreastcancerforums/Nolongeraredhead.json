    "Content": "Hi I was taking Letrozole for about three months and suffered badly with aches and pains in my bones and joints.  Have been taking cod liver oil 1000mg and vitamin D 10mg for about 2 months now and have really noticed an improvement. Took a few weeks to kick in though.  I got mine at Holland and Barrett, COD liver oil also has vit A and Din so be careful and what to buy as too much Vit Dean cause hair to thin!!!!",
