      "Content": "Hi  i had a WLE in November with ANC so I'm 10 weeks post surgery. i had cording for a while but have been very disciplined with exercises and stretching and this has mainly resolved BUT I'm still getting swelling under my arm and back of shoulder, it's quite hard there and feels like Ive got a rolled up newspaper under there constantly though! saw the BCN today as hadn't seen her for 8 weeks as I thought it might be lymphodema but she doesn't think it's too bad, I get the feeling that nobody wants to discuss lymphodema- why is it so taboo? anyway was wondering how long others took for the swellling to resolve after ANC? thank you! x",

      "Content": "Hi Trapin1 They didnt mention seromas to me (or cording come to that!) and it is quite tender under there still. I'm going to go and see the BCN next week as haven't seen her since the drain was removed 7 days post surgery. I hope you continue to make good progress! You are right I know my body needs to re-adjust and I need to be patient - it's not a quality i possess though sadly! thanks again x",

      "Content": "Hi crystaljuju thanks for replying, i have to disagree though as lymphoedema wasn't discussed - i brought it up with my surgeon as my friend had had the same procedure and got lymphodema quite soon afterwards and now wears a sleeve most of the time. i just wanted to make sure i was doing everything correctly to avoid it, but my surgeon was very dismissive of it and i felt that he thought that i was being melodramatic. my physio reacted in a similar way, and as the swelling in my arm was minimal (it is worse in the trunk area) felt that it wasn't an issue. I actually think that most health care professionals just dont know much about lymphodema to be honest! Resources are very limited in most CCGs for this. i'm currently having RT, but if i still have swelling a few weeks after that i will definitely be getting a referral to see a specialist, but for the time being i need to wait and (try) to be paitent - not easy though! x",

My physio showed me how to massage the arm etc as i didnt want to make it worse - so although they might not want to start MLD until after your RT perhaps you could get the BCN or physio to show you how to massage it to encourage the flow! Good luck for RT tomorrow.I'm 2 weeks in and have put soooo much aqueous cream on every day, that i'm hoping it wont get too sore - so far it's been ok. i think i will ask the nurse about the swelling whilst at RT tomorrow. take care x",

I started RT 2 weeks ago so half way through and so far it's going okay, i'm going on my lunch break as back to work now. i know what you mean about getting answers - it's very frustrating isnt it?!  I felt like once the surgeon had referred me to the oncologist i shouldnt really ask him anything! anyway hopefully we will keep making good progress take care x",

I work in health care so understood the risks fully and of course consented to the surgery as the risk outweighed the disease, however what i was saying is that they dont want to recognise that it could be lymphoedema so early on - also when it's not in your arm ( the swelling is in my trunk area) i know that 25% of women that have ACN do get lymphoedema but i actually think that that is probably higher in reality as it is very difficult to get a proper diagnosis when it's not measurable e.g. my physio measures my forearm and there isn't much difference between the two, however you can't measure someone's under arm/breast/trunk. ps this isn't a dig at the NHS as my tx was done privately - i dont think that makes any difference to the after care tbh! thanks",

I did have swelling in my arm and the physio measured it and it has actually reduced since my first physio session, so I have to take the positives I guess! I'm half way through RT at the moment so will wait to finish and then give it a few weeks to see if it all settles down. Thanks for the hug x",
