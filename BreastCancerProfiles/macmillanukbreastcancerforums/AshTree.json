      "Content": "I went in for a CT scan for an unrelated lung condition at the end of January 2018 and was told that I'd hear if anything had changed - having not heard anything I assumed everything was stable. Went in for a clinic appointment yesterday for my lungs, and they confirmed the my lungs were stable but that they had noticed a 'lump' in my right breast. They did an examination there and then, and he could identify a lump he said was around 3cm. He dictated a letter there and then for an urgent referral to the breast clinic and said I'd get a letter through about an appointment soon! I'm 24 years old and he said it was probably nothing to worry about but my main concern is the length of time I went without noticing this/without being notified of this - it has been three months since it was visible on the CT scan... Not sure what else to say really, just that I'm super concerned and needed to tell someone as I don't want to worry my friends or family yet when I don't have all the info!",
