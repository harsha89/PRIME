      "Content": "I am 50 and I was diagnosed at the end of 2018 with bc and was due for lumpectomy and SNB. Consultant wanted me to have gene test and it turned out I am BRCA2. Everything changed and I am now 14 days post op having had bilateral mastectomy and implant reconstruction and right ANC (SNP was positive). I have to see oncologist this week who will decide on chemo and radiotherapy but it looks like I need both followed by tamoxifen for next 5 to 10 years. It\u2019s all been a bit of a whirlwind as I was convinced the lump I found was just a cyst.  Are there any stories of people out there going through this with very few complications.  When I start reading some of the threads it begins to freak me out - is it just that people with positive experiences don\u2019t feel the need to share them? also a question for anyone that\u2019s been through similar op - how long was it before you start to feel vaguely normal and does the chest tightness ever go away? How long is it before you can start sleeping on your side again? Sorry for rambling on - grateful for any advice.",
