      "Content": "Dear Kathryn.b. It\u2019s not surprising that you\u2019re feeling in a state of a shock since your diagnosis, and are anxious about what\u2019s to come. But you should also feel very positive that it is DCIS and, more importantly, that they\u2019re recommending a mastectomy. I too had DCIS in 2009 and had a lumpectomy and radiotherapy. All was well until last year, when on a routine mammogram a recurrence of cancer, invasive this time, was discovered in the same breast. I went on to have a mastectomy, LD flap reconstruction and chemotherapy, and am now fighting fit agin and enjoying life to the full. My main regret was not having a MX (assuming this means a mastectomy? Am probably being thick?!) back in 2009, which would have meant further recurrences wouldn\u2019t have been possible. But it was never offered as an option at the time and I therefore didn\u2019t even ask about it. So although I completely understand your worries and concerns, it looks as though you\u2019re being offered the best treatment and will get rid of that DCIS, never to see it again! I found the op itself no problem, and was amazed at the tiny little dressings that ran along the 3 sides of my newly constructed boob. It healed well and it is so neat that I showed my two daughters (in their 20s) as I knew they probably imagined it to look far worse. They were impressed! It does feel like having a brick attached to you with a very strong rubber band to begin with, but it gets better and feels like part of you in no time. I would strongly recommend you to stick religiously to the exercises given to you by your physiotherapist- I thought she was joking when she said start them the day after the op, but apparently not!- just to make sure you get full movement back after wards. I can now do any exercise I like as long as I have my bullet proof sports bra on, and on this subject, I found the nursing bras in M&S to be super comfortable in the weeks following the op. I was also given a cute, soft little heart shaped cushion before the op by my breast care nurse- they are made by volunteers apparently, and I became very attached to mine! It\u2019s really comfy and I took mine everywhere- to bed, in the car etc. It helps. Finally, I found the Macmillan Centre at my local hospital to be an absolutely brilliant and free resource; you can access complementary therapies such as Reiki, massages etc which can be really pampering when you\u2019re feeling a bit low. But your main resource will be your lovely family and close friends- you will become closer than ever before and will feel cosseted by their love and support. You will get through this and will know that you\u2019ve done everything possible to make sure it never comes back. Good luck and be strong! It will all be fine. Xxx",

      "Content": "Hi all! Having been through breast cancer, a mastectomy and LD flap reconstruction and chemotherapy, finishing treatment last September, it may seem a little strange that I\u2019m concerned with the red spots that are arriving on various parts of my body. Â I\u2019ve been taking Letrozole since September and have had various side effects, but none bad enough to make me consider stopping taking this valuable drug. I\u2019m exercising hard and this is keeping my weight in check, but I feel that if I stopped, the weight would creep up. My legs are swollen too and eyes itchy. These seem to be relatively common side effects and nothing too onerous, but I can\u2019t see any mention anywhere about spots. Rough pimply upper arms, and little red, raised spots on my thighs and occasionally on my face. I\u2019m assuming this is due to hormone changes due to the drug? It may seem a little thing, but when trying to feel positive about your changed, aging body (I\u2019m 58)- new boob, hair growing back but curly and grey (quite like that bit actually) you really could do without SPOTS! Has anyone else experienced this and have you any advice?... I\u2019m not a vain person but- give me a break!",

      "Content": "Thanks for your reply- the first for me on the forum and nice to know there really are people out there! Yes, had really thought spotty teenager problems were wayyyy in my past, but in the grand scheme of things it is very minor I know. I\u2019ll give it a while and see how things go. It\u2019s just strange that I\u2019m getting these wired minor side effects 6 months after starting Letrozole. Big hugs to you too",
