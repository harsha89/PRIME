    "Content": "Hi, I had Leiomyosarcoma in my vulva 5 years ago. It has returned to my abdomen and spread to my lungs. Through having cancer I have found my friends are the very best I could wish for. My family offering total support. I don't want to waste a moment. As I am going through my chemo, my family is growing. My daughter is the proud mum of another boy born 20th Jan. And just today my sons partner gave birth to a beautiful boy, just 6lbs called Leo. I'm very emotional about it but I'm alive and I'll get a cuddle in the next couple of days.Â ",
