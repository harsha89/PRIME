I had BC beginning of last year,my lump on my confidential report and I honestly never went into details all I wanted was it out of my body,was IDC grade 2 but when they took it out was found to be aggressive so stage 3 but that was only reason the aggressiveness of it, HER neg, UOQ 10mm one node was positive, so I said take as many as wanted,so they did, others were all clear. Surgeon said chemo would be borderline but I was determined not to have it,heard so many scare stories and sometimes people have it and it still comes back,id just lost a dear friend where it did and she had it   One of my friends was determined to make me have it, she just wouldn't give up, she came with me to see the oncologist, with another friend,  We walked in the room, he said what did they tell you, I said that I was borderline. He said \"my dear you are not borderline we got it all, it was caused by your long use of HRT, all rest of nodes are clear and margains were clear, you don't need chemo, and to be honest you are such a petite slim person it would do you more harm than good, for very little extra help, you need radio therapy and tamoxifen.Im not giving something like chemo to someone like you, you just don't need it, now lump removed you are still a very healthy women go on and enjoy your life,\" My friend wouldn't give up she asked him what would he say if his wife or sister, he said exactly the same, she just doesent need it. They were the words id waited to hear and never expected to, but I was sure I wasn't going to have it anyway, but what he said obviously made me feel a lot happier not having it and it even reassured my friend, who I know bless her didn't want it to come back and cared about me. Go with how you feel,hopefully you will get kind of reassurance I did, but if not only you can decide,  Some people survive chemo better than others,but I know people who have been very ill on it,  Only you can make the decision Lainy c. no one else.

My friends sister was found to have a cancerous lump, she wasn't much older than you are now, Glad to say 20 years later, she is well and enjoying life. Lets hope its not BC but I thought if it is, knowing that someone of about your age had it, survived 20 years ago when cancer treatment  was ,not as advanced as now  and is well to this day might help to make you feel better.

So I let them. The others all came back clear and had clear margains, But I don't regret having them done, yes my arm does feel a bit tingly and heavy sometimes, but it doesent stop me doing anything, I garden, carry shopping etc, ok if I do a bit too much with it it does ache so I stop, But no after effects apart from that My BC nurse told me as I was healthy in other ways and am very slightly built she didn't thing id ever get lympthodema and nearly 2 years later all well. Didn't have chemo just radio therapy and on tamoxifen. Personal choice Cathy but do what you want, I made a snap decision but as said was still thinking of my old colleague bout year older than me.guess that swayed me, and I didn't fancy any more ops, guess if other nodes affected id have had to have chemo,but again as im so slightly built the oncologist didn't want to give me that, he felt would be no benefit and possibly make me permanently unhealthy.

We had a great and happy meal out after both our treatments finished. Im not sure what you are supposed to do if single, you cant actually go out and find a partner just cause you've got breast cancer. I felt the article could be of concern to ladies who are alone, and would worry them that because alone their survival chances might be lower.Ive never been married or lived with a partner and since my dad went into care 9 years ago, hes since died, I ve lived alone, may be im used to it, but although obviously without a partner and family you do have more lonely moments than those who do, i don't honestly think it makes your survival chances less, you have to look after yourself and socialize once recovered as much as possible.I sat said helpful friends dog through my rads, and that helped me,. If i ever felt down, a little warm body would cuddle up to ,me, and smother me with kisses, sure it helped.  cant have a dog myself, i live in a flat.   June",

Its hard being on own sometimes and some find it harder than others, breast cancer is hard enough to deal with without people worrying re that, Though being partnerless I do sometimes feel it, as im an only child, parents gone, few relatives, I come from a very small family, I am fortunate in having good friends. I live in a city but I have a few friendly neighbours, friends I worked with,im  now retired  said friend whos dog I sit, love him loads bless him , and others from work, and my old school friend who had the ovarian cancer, we have known each other since in our mums womb practically, we come from same village originally, and our birthdays one day apart. She lives 30 miles from me but we still meet regularly. Also ive made a new friend on our local streetlife, she moved from London about 2 yrs ago is divorced  and she has just started a meet up dining group, we have a meal out sat night, the first evening one at our local Carluccios,Her and I have done a few things together, we both like ballet so off to that in Feb,ive also x arranged a trip for 30 friends from various shades of my life to see Mamma mia in March when it comes here It is hard being on own sometimes and yes we would all love to meet someone special, and being single does make you feel lonely sometimes  I know ive felt it,  but sadly it doesent happen to us all,\\I guess women find a social circle easier than men, women on own do seem more social don't they. Surely though if you have gone through your life with no friends, you must be a very sad and unhappy person anyway, so you would find it difficult.Actually on one of the other BCC sites I was on when going through my treatment, I did come across someone like that,. she seemed very lonely but talking to her I could see why.she really made no effort to make friends ever,.  When  I said well she had worked in quite a large organisation, surely she had some friends from that,she didn't, and didn't seem to have any anywhere. She was in 60s and I found myself thinking how the hell do you get to that age with no friends,. Food for thought Carolyn.Junexx",

I've been taking tamoxifen for forty days. When I started I was still experiencing side effects from chemo so it has taken a while to narrow down what causes what. I now feel like I understand what the tamoxifen is doing. I was given wockhardt brand which, from memory, is a brand that some found the easiest to deal with.  I am suffering from painful hands and feet, escalating to wrists and ankles, sometimes reaching as far as the elbow and knee and occasionally one hip! The worst part for me is my thumb base, worse in my dominant hand, causing me to need help (or suffering pain if there's nobody around) when I try to do things like opening pop bottles, opening bags of crisps or similar, closing press studs, pulling up trousers, squeezing the toothpaste tube. I'm sure there's a hundred more things but you get the gist. I love to cross stitch and I'm afraid the pain is cramping my style in that area too. So, on to my question, has anyone been in the same boat, with this brand? (Or is it really the best one) And if so, was there anything that would ease the pain, or did you change brand successfully? I'm reluctant to change brand as one of my initial worries was that the tamoxifen would turn me into superbitch, but it has mellowed my mood massively and I don't get the irrational mood swings I was getting (my whole life) previously.

Im much older than you and honestly I feel a lot younger than my age, I wasn't mad on taking tamoxifen as ive always been anti drugs, well I took HRT for years, hence the breast cancer, my oncologist said, but I never really thought of that as a drug. Taking one 20 mg did give me more side effects but with the 2 10 mg it doesent see too bad,  From what ive read on here tamoxifen does maybe seem better than the others , they seem to have worse side effects, so maybe give it a go,I take the Wockhardt  brand.

Saw one for drug treatment he said !we got all your cancer you know\" tamoxifen for 10 yrs,  Then saw the other oncologist who told me very emphatically I did NOT need chemo, I was a healthy women but im very slightly built and it could affect me very badly,in fact he said much more than cancer had.  he said as my cancer in his eyes had been caused by my long term use of HRT, and nothing else, he felt having chemo would be pointless, My friend who was with me and was convinced that everyone needs chemo, we had been arguing about it as id said I wasn't having it anyway,pressed him as to was he sure, he said very, she doesent need it and im not giving it to her when she dosent,  Its often given when unnecessary and it is for her, Rads and tamoxifen will be fine. I have to stress mine was a smallish lump, though aggressive found very early. Yes many do have chemo and are ok, but many are not my hairdressers mum in law who had BC same time as me, is still suffering the after effects, heart problems, and had to have a bowel operation. I don't think her health was good as mine, I believe she smoked but 2 years on she hasn't recovered, whereas I have no after effects. They are powerful drugs, and im having to come to terms with taking tamoxifen for 10 years, and ive had one of two problems with it, but nothing serious and ok now, so I can see no point in having something like chemo if it will hardly make any difference,  Your choice Ruthie, make it yourself,dont let anyone tell you what to do, only you and you alone can decide.  June",

As said no chemo needed, the oncologist I saw, another really nice man said chemo for me wasn't necessary, as im tiny would do me more harm than good and am on tamoxifen for 10 years, Ask  for another surgeon, you deserve better treatment than this,  I haven't got any nodes left under my left arm, I just wanted them all gone, anyway, its a rather odd numb feeling, but I can live with that, There is no reason why you cant have all your nodes taken,it certainly hasn't done me any harm.

No problem.mine was grade 2 initially, ER pos HER2 neg omne node was positive.13 mm  then scaled up to 3 only because was fast growing, but as I found it early, they removed the lump,and margains were clear and other nodes fine,  I told them to take more as id didn't want another operation and someone I worked with a few years ago, didn't have her nodes removed, and her cancer came back, Ok mine were fine, but losing them hasn't caused me any problems,  When I originally saw the surgeon he said I was borderline for chemo but didn't seem to think would make that ,much difference anyway so I had decided I didn't want it.  When I saw the oncologist, his first words were \"you dont need chemo\" the best words id heard since diagnosed, he said you were on HRT far too long,thats what caused your BC nothing else, you are a very healthy women in every other way.Chemo would hardly make any difference to your prognosis which is good anyway and im not giving it to someone as healthy as you, you are tiny, im 4 11 and weight 7 stone, it could do you more harm than good in fact it could debilitate you for life\" My friend who was with me and bless as im single had been a tower of strength to me, said are you sure, what if was your wife or sister, he said id say the same, she doesent need chemo, Rads and tamoxifen is fine , HRT shouldn't be prescribed, my friend who is on menopause said I was thinking of starting it, he dont think about it ever.   This was beginning of last year and im feeling fine now.  Obviously mine also was caused by high oestrogen too, like yours, Problems with tamoxifen was I started getting a lot of bloating and some joint pain after being on it a year, though Im over 60 tamoxifen was prescribed because of my osteoporosis risk, I dont want to take other drugs for that. So Dr changed me to 10mg tablets, I take 2 at different times of day, seems better, this way, I dont get joint pain now and bit b loating but nowhere near as bad. Ive always hated taking drugs, I resisted the one for osteoporosis as it also gave me gastric problems and it was same one my mum took years ago which frankly did her no good at all. But I know ive got  to take tamoxifen and it does help bones so im \"killing 2 birds with one stone\" I guess. I had my first mammogram in March and now feel fine. Its weird its like it happened to someone else now I dont dwell on it, and try and put it at back of my mind, maybe that is easier if you dont have the trauma of chemo, I dont know. Keep me posted how you get on and anything else you want to know ill be pleased to inform you if I can.I know when I was diagnosed, 2 people I know who had had BC over 20 years ago and both fine now, I had a chat with and they advised me, it always helps to talk to someone who has been through it.

But I found it early 2 years later, after lumpdecomy and rads im here and well,   Your risk of having BC is much lower,  But if it is, my friends sister had it at 28, her family had the BR gene and it was discovered when they had the gene test, they both had the gene, but she actually had cancer, but 20 years later shes ok and enjoying life.  And treatments have improved a ,lot in that time.    Keep us posted.   June",

      "Content": "Hi, Thanks for that, The reason I took HRT for so long was the fact that my mum had early menopause too and she got osteoporosis very badly she was taller than me,im the family miget. lol but by time she died I towered over her,  It totally crippled her and my mum was a very smartly dressed lady. she hated seeing  herself with this horrible hump, she basically just gave up, She had to go into care my dad couldn't cope with it,he bless him was 5 years older than her and lived till 98. She didn't look like my mum any more I hated seeing her that way, and she would have hated it too, she was too bent to see herself in mirrors, A girl I knew was one of carers in home and she only recognised my mum by my picture by her bedside. That's how much she had changed, So Carolyn you can see why I felt as I did when I got BC, i didn't ever regret taking HRT for so long,i never wanted to end up looking like my mum, I do care about how I look and I always will. Luckily I have inherited my dads teeth he had them till he died, no chipslol. I don't think people realise how women are tied up with their hair, losing it is crap, i give thanks every day i didn't when i brush it.i overplucked my eyebrows when young as we all did in 60s, i have to pencil them in, but ive still quite good eyelashes., A strange side effect of node removal seems to be underarm hair doesent seem to grow, Now that i can live with.  June.",

Im feeling fine at the age my mum was starting to feel the effects of osteoporosis, id rather have had cancer than what she had.  Until we start dealing with cancer like any other illness, peoples fear of it it will never change and Macmillans campaigns don't help this. Before I knew I didn't need chemo the fear of losing my hair was worse to me than having the cancer,. im a tough old bird, I knew id get over it, but losing my hair filled me with horror, I was set to refuse chemo,as initially I was borderline, in spite of my friends entreating me to have it. Ive always had short hair but starting growing it at 60 it took me two years, I always hated the \"older women shouldn't have long hair\", im dammed if I wanted to lose it.  I look a lot like my dad, and he was bald, he nearly drowned when young and it caused him to lose his hair, shock they said,  I adored my dad, but I didn't want to look that much like him.lol.

We need more of these kinds of stories to show cancer is an illness like any other,many recover from it and take away the mystique of it, which often puts fear into peoples heads and they ignore symptoms and we all know early detectiom helps survival chances Like you Alison its that sad music that gets to me,and yes you are right people with cancer are living lives.My old friend and i rarely mention ours and to be honest thankfully nor do many of my friends mine.And thats fine,cancer doesent define us.

They are the brave ones and all the people on here going through chemo now,maybe losing eyebrows,eyelashes,even finger nails and toenails.Not silly people shaving their heads.   June ",

From what ive read of many of you on here, you are same as me, always done the right thing and still got breast cancer.  My only risk was my long term use of HRT because of my early menopause,and my high risk of osteoporosis  due to my slight build and my mum having it very badly. This of course was prescribed to me by a doctor,.My mum had it so badly, I didn't want to end up like her, and as my other risks were so small, I took HRT for a long time,.  Now I wonder did I take too much,did I as a small slight women need the dose I took. I don't need this kind of rubbish that cancer is a lifestyle thing, nor do any of us  it isn t, its random it can happen to anyone, fit or not fit,.  When I went to see my oncologist for the first time, after my operation and he told me I wouldn't need chemo, I noticed on the computer screen it said \"very healthy women\" and he said for my age I was in excellent shape.

Yes I do agree, ok I took HRT which seemed to be my only risk factor that I could see,and I probably took it to long. but  I watched my mum disintegrate with it, She was 4 inches taller than me, and by the time she died I towered over her. Take HRT the doctors said, if you don't want to end up like her. Well I haven't got that but I got cancer. I now use pareben free deodorant but I do still drink wine,i enjoy a glass with my evening meal, but I always buy low alcohol wines now, and junk food has never passed my lips.  Some said to me \"o well you can eat what you want now\" lol, no thank you I hate junk food anyway, im hardly likely to start living on Macdonalds. My oldest friend who had ovarian cancer same time as I had breast ran into someone we were both at school with, after she had recovered from it,  This women who is very obese said to her \"O you with all your gym visits and weighing same as when young ,  etc. \" and you got cancer, look at me im fine.  I would have said \"you don't know whats going on inside\"  or worse lol but my friend who is a kindly soul just gritted her teeth. A another  friend of mine whose mum and gran both had BC is now on a mad exercise kick, runs every morning, circuit training, god knows what else. she was slim and petite anyway. and didn't smoke,.  This all started after her mum got it, I hope she doesent think it will definitely stop her getting it, cause obviously theres a family connection. There are no guarantees sadly and id hate that  these kind of articles might make people think there are. Hope we both stay well, have my second year mammogram in couple weeks, always a bit worrying but I try not to think about it too much. As I said to my friend, the fact we were pretty fit helped us to recover quicker and should stand us in good stead. Junex",

Does seem to have helped, I had bloating to and that is better, still get it occasionally but not as much. Sometimes if say Im going out in evening, I skip one pill and only take one in evening when I get home. Dr said this was ok. Did read the other day, did anyone else?that they gave women who are high risk of getting BC tamoxifen and others a placebo, and they all had same side effects,  I do find that hard to believe, after all they might be high risk but they haven't actually had BC have they,  My body must have been loaded with oestrogen as I took HRT for years due to early menopause like my mum, guess it still wants it, if only but I was told in no uncertain terms by my oncologist that oestrogen caused my BC and I must never take it again.  My friend who was with me and is having the menopause said she had thought of taking it,. He said no definitely not, don't even think about it. So there you have it,dont really have much choice do we.

Didn't have chemo as my oncologist said the benefit was minimal and as I was so tiny he felt might make me ill as would have to have massive dose to make even slightest difference, Had rads and on tamoxifen, probably why my bust size increased, I know many get weight gain with it, but although ive a few reasonably manageable side effects, weight gain isn't one of them. But I expect like me it sounds like you've always been tiny so sure you wont either.  June.",

Hers was passed through the male line before it reached her mum and aunt. Her sister and cousin also had gene.  Hers I think was helped because before she died her mum donated tissue so the tests could be carried out more successfully.This was 18 years ago in the sort of infancy of it, then they had to fight to get the tests done.  Was very fortunate they did as they all tested positively for the gene, her sister in fact had a cancer already forming which the test found I was successfully removed and shes fine today.  All 3 of them had a double mascectomy and reconstruction. and all are well to this day.Her cousin and sister who are the oldest have had ovaries removed to, as yet my friend hasn't; Another close friend of mine lost many relatives to ovarian and breast cancer, years ago  her mum and one of her cousins had ovarian but survived, She had ovarian same time as I had breast but had the test and was told hers wasn't genetic, although she still feels some connection,. Shes ok now to has to have 3 monthly check ups but all ok so far.  The test from what they all said is quite straight forward.   June",

Fixed op date for 9th Feb then later got call to say due to operational reasons date needs to be changed, The breast nurse was great but thank god my lovely friend was with me she took over the call and said she didnt think i would stand a longer wait living alone, as i do, and yes ive great friends but they cant be there all time, could they do something. So now have got another surgeon, good, on 29th Jan, Still worried though i said would having whole breast removed be better, id have both off if necessary but he said no,its not in breast anywhere else, but the lump is at top of breast not actually in it not that far from lympth glands so thats why its strayed  Has anyone else had this kind of lump,i feel ive taken a step back again. ",

Before then I was sure I wasn't going to have it anyway, in spite of my close friends telling me I should, One in particular, was really insistant I did,  One day she burst into tears and told me she wanted me to have it cause she didn't want me to die, she cared so much about me, and so did her dog, which I often care for when shes at work. She was always ringing me checking on me, sometimes it got a bit much, but I realised she cared and I knew if I needed her she only lives bout mile away, I only had to ring and shed be round.She even worked a sat so she could come to hospital with me during week.  As I don't have much family this was a comfort..  I only told her and a few other close friends until I was sure of situation, as I didn't want to many people asking me how I was. Sometimes you just don't need that, you just want to get through it and go back to normal.  But people do care, I guess its nice they care enough to be concerned, but I agree sometimes you feel you just don't need the \"how are you\" and I got a lot of \"I cant believe you've had cancer\" you look so well.  June",
