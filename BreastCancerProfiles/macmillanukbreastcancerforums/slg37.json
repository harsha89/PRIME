      "Content": "Hi Louise I'm only a few years older than you and had chemo (FEC-T+H), surgery, radiation and am continuing with Herceptin (H). Regarding your pain and node clearance. It does get better. I found for me that the pains and sensation could be wide ranging types, weird and migratory. One day they are one thing, the next another and somewhere else. It's all part of the nerves healing and sensations returning. I'm 4 months on from surgery - most of my pain & discomfort is gone and I have very very good movement in my arm. I too was very protective of my arm in the weeks immediately post surgery and held it awkwardly as I was really afraid of hurting my arm and getting Lymphoedema, but one of the best things I did was to use it normally on a graduated basis i.e. start small, don't overdo it, no sharp movements or anything heavy. It was my left arm and I am right handed so I made myself use it for normal everyday activities that I wouldn't normally have used it for otherwise it wouldn't get excercised much. So using my left hand, I opened the fridge, got mugs out of the cupboard with it, made cups of tea etc.  I also tried to do the exercises every day. I definitely started to improve. However, a few weeks on, I noticed I seemed to be worsening and the ground I had gained falling away. I had developed cording, my arm tightened up, movement became more restricted and there was more pain which started to extend further down my arm to places it had never been before and into my wrist. I spoke to the bcn quite quickly and was referred to a breast care physio for help which even after only one session, was immensely helpful and practically restored all movement I'd originally gained and released the pain!! A lovely nurse at my GP's who was 9 years on told me that it does improve gradually but persistently and to keep at it for several months even when you think you are better because the improvements will continue almost imperceptibly. The hospital gave me a small heart shaped pillow that the local patchworker group makes for the breast unit to go under my arm to help support it better and move it away from my body a bit. I found that very useful and supportive at night/sitting on the sofa. I found lying on the opposite side to my operation tipped towards my front, but with a pillow wedged in front of me to stop me tipping too far forward onto the sore breast also helped and was more comfortable than on my back when I was bit more healed. Wishing you all the best x",

      "Content": "I have that on Herceptin too like the others who replied. It's one of the listed side effects \"Nasal Drip\". Such a delightful effect! I get it each cycle but it's got much better since my nose hair regrew, but it still takes me by surprise sometimes. Are you on Herceptin? Even if it's that causing it, I'd suggest talking to your GP/Oncologist, they may be able to prescribe something more suitable than the antihistamines that will help",

      "Content": "Congratulations on getting to the end of chemo - it's a great feeling!! I finished chemo at the end of October and my straggly spider leg eyelashes have just about gained a few neighbours and there's some miniscule baby ones coming too. I think I've seen something somewhere about vaseline on eyelashes to make them grow quicker, but I have no idea what that's about or if it even works; I keep meaning to find out more. Maybe someone on here knows something about it?",
