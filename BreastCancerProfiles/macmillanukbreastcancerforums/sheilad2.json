    "Content": "Hello you guys. Has anyone experience of recurring nodules on mastectomy site? I've had four crops removed and another bunch are blossoming. Surgery on April 1st is booked.  Surgeon talked about electrochemotherapy as an alternative. Googled it, seems very new.  Any comments, had two separate chemo courses couple of years apart and radiation therapy, single mastectomy followed by these recurrent nasties allied to first cancer in histology report. Feeling ok just want to get on with life and stop focussing on health issues!! Thanks for listening.",
