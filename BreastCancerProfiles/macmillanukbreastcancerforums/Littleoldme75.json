    "Content": "I have a braca1 alteration and had a scare following a scan earlier this year. I've decided to have a risk reducing mastectomy but am unsure about reconstruction. I realise that everyone make decisions based on their own circumstances. I am worried about biomechanical problems in the future arising from using muscles in reconstruction. I've seen that diep flap recon doesn't need any muscles moving or removing. The counsellor I saw yesterday didn't give me a clear answer when i asked about it and I was too bamboozled to notice until I got back home. Any thoughts, advice or experiences would be very gratefully recieved. Thank you x",
