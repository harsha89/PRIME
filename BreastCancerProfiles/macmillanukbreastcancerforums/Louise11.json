      "Content": "Hi jo.thank you. i have just boreing white pants lol.nice and stretchy .must say in all the worrying at mo your reply did give me a chuckle I can just imagine trying to same thing. I was adviced to buy a couple of crop top bras which I have.bugger me how I will get them on after surgery it's bad enough before. I do a normal one at front and turn it round. I have been busy this week by trying to take my mind off things by making myself a couple of bag things to pop my drains in 1 around waist 1 roubd shoulder and a small pillow to tuck under my arm and for wearing when travelling in car for seat belt . I was adviced on not waiting extra time to have reconstruction done at same time as it would be a longer wait.so looking at that later on.im a dd/e cup so have been thinking about reduction on other one later.Â ",
