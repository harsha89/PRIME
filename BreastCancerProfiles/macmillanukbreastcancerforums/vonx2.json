      "Content": "Hi Alison Thanks for your reply Mine was from a tummy tuck but my 'new' breast seems bigger than my good one. although it is only 3 weeks since my op so i guess the swelling has not gone down yet. The surgeon did mention about an uplift if needed. I would quite like bigger boobs, but my husband didn't want me to have anymore surgery than that which was needed. So i was wondering if my new boob would 'shrink'. But as you say, it takes a while for the swelling to go down, so I guess I will have to be patient to see if I am equal at both sides!! Von xxxxx",

At the moment it is larger than my good boob, but its only 3 weeks since I had my reconstruction, so maybe it will get smaller as the swelling goes down. Von xxx",

As for your tummy button, they actually cut around it and reposition it, so it's in the right place. They pull the skin downwards so it doesn't affect the pubic area. Good luck with your treatment.

I go back to see the plastic surgeon in January, and am hoping that I can get my new breast made more like my other one, and get a 'new' nipple made. I think having the breast care nurse helped me a lot, as she gave advice and it was 'someone to talk to'. Good luck Von xx",

Its really nice to be able to talk to people on here who've had similar experiences, I find it helps a lot, just having someone to talk to is great. I had a problem the other day with my self esteem, which shook me, as it was so unexpected! Do other people have the same problem? I may have to have a skin graft, some of the skin has died on my boob, has anyone had the same? Once again, thanks for your reply. Von xx",

All I want to do now is recover from the op, and hopefully get the all clear, so I can get on with my life! I must admit, I was lucky to be able to have the reconstrution and the diep flap, there seem to be lots of people who didn't have that choice. I've a portion of dead skin on my reconstrucion, which the Dr's think will grow back. It does seem to have pink around the edges, so I am hoping this is a good sign. I see the surgeon on Monday, so fingers crossed!! Good luck with yours, I hope it all goes well for you in November! Its so nice to have someone to talk to!! love Von xxxxxxxxxxxxx",

Sorry to hear about your problems, especially loosing your job. I applied and got a new job with the NHS where I already work, before my op. I have not started the new job yet, so I hope they'll hold it for me!! I think they should do, as they knew about my surgery when I had the interview. Its quite a manual job, so I'll not be able to take up the post until I'm fully fit. Thanks again for the info! Cheers Von xx",

      "Content": "I contacted my BC nurse to ask about any emotional support, I(and my husband) can have, and any complimentary therapies. she told me they were available! Why is this information not just given to us, why did I need to ask? I agree, that some nurses don't seem to realise what an impact BC can have on people and they should be more supportive! My experience was, I was told I couldn't have a lumpectomey and my only option was a mastectomy (all matter of fact!). Then I was given a video of different reconstructive surgery, from which I had to make a choice. there was no emotional support at all. I must admit everyone was nice to me, but it was all medical information and no emotional support before the op at all. And even afterwards, although staff were nice, there's no emotional support unless you ask for it. My BC nurse is sending me some info in the post, so I'll see what they have to offer. So my advice is to ask what's available, as they don't seem to offer unless you ask first! Von xxx",

      "Content": "Hi Ive just had a mastectomy with reconstruction with a diep flap. I was diagnosed in March when I went for a routine mamagramme. The cancer was in the milk ducts, therefore I had no lump, or any idea there was anything wrong. It was a complete shock, but I decided to have the mastectomy even tho I still found it difficult to beleive that I had cancer. I had the op 10 days ago, and apart from some skin on the breast dying, I seem to be healing well. I have had lots of medical support, but no emotional support has been offered. That's why I joined this site just to chat with others, and maybe find out if there's some sort of group, other than this site, where I can get support. I have read a lot of the posts, and thought it was a friendly site, where everyone shares their experiences, which I have found to be very helpful.",

Its quite frightening, seeing the scars! some of the nurses in hospital were great, but some were quite rough with me and some of them kept pulling my attached drains by accident!!! Thanks everyone for the encouragement. I think my confidence will come back, when my scars etc have healed, I am worried at the moment in case people bump into me! I guess the hardest part will be returning back to work after a long break. I am going to talk to my manager, when the time comes, to see if I can phase back to work slowly, so as not to over do things at first. Cheers Von xx",

The breast shape is excellent, and no one would know by looking at me, that I've had the reconstruction. I had mine straight away after the mastectomy, so they used most of the skin from my breast, and used the fat from my tummy to 'fill' it. You do need a week in hospital, as it is a big operation. Also you'll need someone at home to look after you for the first week after leaving hospital. I had mine three weeks ago, and I can potter around the house and go for short walks. It does take time to recover, but I think its worth it. Hope this helps All the best Von xxxx",
