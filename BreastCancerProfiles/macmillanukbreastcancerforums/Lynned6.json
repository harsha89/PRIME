      "Content": "Hi Leen, I've just finished treatment (except for tamoxifen) and i haven't had a MRI or CT scan.  I think this was because my cancer was stage 2 / grade 2 with no lymph node involvement.  Treatment involved a therapeutic mammaplasty (lumpectomy or wide local incision WLE), cosmetic mammaplasty to the other breast (to match them up), sentinel node biopsy and radiotherapy.  It seem very overwhelming at the start but just take it one day at a time and stay away from google - stick to this site as many of the others offer out of date information. I wouldn't worry about the nipple but everyone is different - have you seen some of the photos of nipple tattoos, they look fabulous.  There are also some very friendly support groups on facebook that are closed so you can feel safe voicing any concerns or just screaming sometimes.  Good Luck on your journey xxxx",

      "Content": "Hi masquerade2010,  sorry to hear your news but it really isn't the end of the world.  I as diagnosed in October 2014 stage 2 invasive ductal cancer grade 2.  I had a lumpectomy, sentinal node biopsy and 15 sessions of radiotherapy and I know take Tamoxifen (10 years).  The worse bit is the waiting but things will start happening and it'll be like a whirlwind, I can't fault the treatment that I received from the NHS.  While you're waiting resist the urge to google, most information is out of date, if you need more info ask your healthcare staff or stick to Macmillan or the Breast Cancer Care site.  If you want to talk at any time, just shout Lynne",

      "Content": "Hi Rebecca, I had a lumpectomy and cosmetic reduction to the other breast on the 12th of November and there is really no need to panic.  I had little pain after the operation and no restriction in my movement in the following weeks.  I'm now waiting for my radiotherapy to start (no chemo) but have been told by my surgeon that I am cancer free following the operation.  I was also very scared by the whole situation and I think most people are.  Try to take it one day at a time and deal with what's happening step by step.  I didn't read any literature as it all made me panic but now I'm feeling calmer I've gone back and read more about the disease. If I can help with any question that you have regarding the operation or anything really, give me a shout xx You can do this x",
