      "Content": "Hi After surgery, rads and now Tamoxifen and Zoladex for pre menopause oestrogen positive cancer, I'm starting work again this week. I'm so low though, I've got terrible insomnia from the Tamoxifen. I feel like I don't want to go back yet. My GP says it's time to try. But, right going to be so honest here. My life before cancer was not too wonderful.  I went to work to pay the bills, I'm married but my marriage doesn't make me happy. So before cancer I was going through the motions, existing but not living.  Now going back to work seems like I'm stepping back into my sad little life without being able to wave a magic wand and dream of a new start. It's like I'm going back to all the conditions that added to my diagnosis. Years of unhappiness. I even feel life isn't worth this. I should be feeling I'm lucky surely? I'm so down. I thought about just disappearing so ironic after fighting to survive for so long.",

You are quite amazing you know! You restore my faith in everything. I really do think my medication especially the Tamoxifen seems to be making me into a different person. I am phoning the doctor TODAY. I need some help at the moment and yes I have troubles at home, life is like that, but with the Tamoxifen I have been feeling so low. Scarily so. I will seek help right now. You don't realise how much each and every reply has helped me. You've made me sit up and tackle this.  THANK YOU ALL OF YOU",

Had invasive DCIS in both breasts plus a micromet in one node. Grade 2 tumour. No chemo.  Just had first Zoladex injection and starting radiotherapy on Monday for 1 month. Then starting Tamoxifen.   However after a visit to GP today she agreed with me that we think near my original tumour site is a new lump. Large and nobbly just like the first. She's faxing an urgent letter to oncologist. I'm scared and really want radiotherapy to begin I've already waited 12 weeks. Could a new tumour really grow so quickly? ",

This is the burning question I've waited 7 weeks for an answer for. Chemo or no chemo. Today the test has not really helped. Basically I'm slap bang in the middle! Score was 21. Anything under 18 is a no to chemo. Anything over 25 a yes to chemo. I'm 45 years old. My stats are for a 10 year prognosis  84% if no treatment, add on 3.8 percent with radiotherapy and Tamoxifen.  Chemo would add on 1.9 % on top.  The chemo could help but it's a low percentage. She said I have the overall decision.  So hard! I don't want to ever have to regret thinking I should have had it, but statistically it's very small amount of possible help. There are no guarantees it would help or I could be that tiny fraction of people ie 3 in 100 women based on my stats that it would help. Confused!  Any advice most appreciated  xxxx",

I don't want to live with regret and have to be happy with my decision. Because my cancer is invasive and reached a node, I wonder if a rogue cell escaped etc and chemo could seek it out.

      "Content": "Hello lovely lady  Just sending you hugs and some kind positive thoughts. Sorry your going through this. Waiting for results/ worrying about medications etc. Wednesday will be here before you know it. Worrying will not change the outcome only take away your strength and ruin a day that could be good. I'm probably the world's worst worrier. I worry if I'm not worrying! I could win the award for worrying. Try Lavender oil on your pillow. Do things you like doing. Laugh at silly TV. I watched a re-run of the Vicar of Dibley and it made me laugh out loud.  Xxxxx hugs xxxx x Pootle ",
