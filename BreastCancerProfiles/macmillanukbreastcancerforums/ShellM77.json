      "Content": "Hello All, I am still here!  I had my 4th cycle of Docetaxel and Carboplatin yesterday with the delightful cold cap!  Did have some good news though - I got my midterm CT scan results back and the tumour in my breast has shrunk so much it couldn't be measured.  The tumours in my lymph nodes have also reduced from 28mm x 30mm to 14mm x 16mm. So happy with that news and makes it all worthwhile.  Not bad for someone with stage 3 aggressive little tumours! Best of luck to everyone here. Love and hugs Shell x",

      "Content": "Hello All, I\u2019m still here too! Had 5th cycle of Docetaxel and Carboplatin last week and feeling rather rubbish. Tastebuds have completely deserted me and everything aches. I also have pins and needles in my fingertips which is beginning to irritate me!  At least the cold cap is working and I still have hair.....every cloud! Hoping to feel better soon but this cycle has definitely hit me harder than the previous cycles. Not looking forward to the next cycle on the 16 April. Love and hugs to everyone riding the chemo train this month. shell x",

      "Content": "Hello, Welcome to the group but sorry you find yourself here. I find this group to be invaluable for help and support. I have had 3 cycles of Carboplatin. I have found the worst side effect is the metallic taste to everything which I just can\u2019t seem to get rid of. I haven\u2019t had any sickness at all. I take 2 Ondansetron tablets the day of chemo and for a further 2 days. This drug does cause constipation but a dulcolax tablet sorts this.  I also have Domperidone anti sickness tablets to take as needed. I hope this is of some help at least! Love and hugs Shell x",
