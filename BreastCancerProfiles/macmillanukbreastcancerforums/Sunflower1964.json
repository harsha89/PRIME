      "Content": "Hi .. I had a lumpectomy and lymph node removal on 23/04/14 and had first lot of FEC on 05/06/14. So far the side effects, although not pleasant, have been manageable ... but I've recently noticed that I have black stripes on either side of my tongue.  I'm using the 'Chlorhexidine Gluconate mouthwash the hospital gave me regularly but prefer the 'Biotene'  mouthwash  - given to me by a colleague at work who had breast cancer treatment herself last year  as it's much gentler on my mouth ulcers but I am wondering whether using both mouthwashes is responsible ...? Has anyone else experienced this? Jaine",

      "Content": "Hi Tracey, My hygenist had mentioned about diflam when I last saw her but I had forgotten about it. Thanks Tracey.  I'll definately be asking my GP/Chemo team to prescribe it. I wasn't told about  the mouthwash causing staining as er Mariannes post and I will run it by the chemo team.  I am relieved that it's not because of something more sinister though. I had tried to ring the hospital about this but NRRR - Sunday hours I suppose ... thank-goodness for this forum, :) ",
