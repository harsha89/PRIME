      "Content": "thankyou so much for taking the time to share your story.must have been a difficult time in your household especially with the girls taking exams.i was told my only option is a mastectomy and i still can not get my head round it.i go to castle hill again on tuesday to discuss things,hope i get a date soon to get it over with. i am surprised they said 6 weeks before driving,i was hoping it would be less than that,i had promised to do so much with the grandchildren. good you are driving and going to the gym again.i understand a few weeks out of your life is a small price to pay for saving your life but worry about not going to work and doing stuff with the grandchildren. its good you have kept your nipple,i go to see the consultant on tuesday,hope this is an option for me. its nice to hear from someone who as come through it. wishing you well and good luck to the girls with their exams take care x",

      "Content": "so sorry to hear of your situation.you have been through a lot and sad that you do not feel healed.You should really discuss this with your consultant.Have you tried talking to one of the macmillian nurses about your fears?Maybe they could advise or reassure you. I have to have a mastectomy because i was told i can not just have the lump removed followed by radiotherapy because i have had radiotheapy on my chest years ago.i was hoping that i could have an implant but was told today i can not have an implant because i have had radiotherapy,im diabetic and take tablets for high blood pressure so the risks are too high and the consultant will not do it. I feel sad having to lose my boob but at least i know it will get rid of the problem.my partner said well its better than losing an arm or a leg and it will still be you. For me i didnt have a choice about a mastectomy but you should really speak to someone medically qualified for advice.in the meantime its great to come on here for support. take care x",
