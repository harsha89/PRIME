My hands and feet r unbearable,I've got an upset tum, I'm tired all the time and was in a&e last Friday with a temp of 38.8. Not neutropenic tho. I've got to visit the unit tomorrow as they are worried because my arms are now getting red, and there was something in my bloods.. At this rate I won't be going away on Saturday. Did anyone else have sore feet etc, and how long did it last.. Unless they can find some way to stop it next time I might just give up. Oh and all my joints hurt. There I've finished now. Kath. Xx",

She will have to have more operations as she goes on growing, but that's the third one out of the way. She will have discomfort and swelling for some time but is doing OK. I've mentioned her and her Aperts several times on here so just thought I'd let you know. She is only two but is coping so well and we are all very proud of her. Kath",

In two ops and lymph nodes stripped after sentinel nodes found three affected. All others were clear tho. So why do some have mx and others lumpectomies for what seem similar size etc. worries me that I may not have had enough done. Also now I'm on chemo and seems like some people get more meds to go with chemo than others. E.g. I having injections growth hormones to increase white cell count I think but not everyone gets them. Also I had to have steroids before Tax as risk of bad reaction but a friend doesn't. Very confusing and I don't get it. It's stressed enough without worrying that my treatment is different. I understand that second lump was found as my cancer turned out to be not what initial biopsy result showed so had an MRI scan which found lymph node right next to original lump with cancer signs but can't help thinking I should have had mx at this point. Rather muddled post. Sorry. Had first Tax yesterday. Very tired but can't sleep probably steroids which I had to have intravenously as they forgot to give me tablets! Kath",

I lost my appetite completely, everything tasted horrid, my mouth was sore and I had no energy to make food. I lost 2.5 stone. I still don't want sweet stuff or citrusy stuff, drinks except coffee and strangely tonic water r a no no. Water yech! It's five weeks since my last chemo and I'm still losing weight (not a bad thing for me as I am large ). Chocolate is also yech. It feels funny on my tongue. I miss treats though. I think the best thing is not to worry about your weight but eat whatever you can. I found I was extra tired because for a week after each dose of chemo I could eat nothing except occasionally marmite on toast, as soon as I could eat a bit more I felt better. Enjoy your sweets!

It's not always easy being a mum to know when to ask questions and when to wait to be talked to. I've got two daughters and sometimes one will tell me something I don't know about the other and I have to wait until they tell me themselves Maybe you should tell your mum how you feel she'll probably be gutted you are feeling like that.

I'm planning to go back to work for a few hours next week and I can't wait. My manager and the company have been amazing and have carried over my leave from last year so I have 63 days to use up so I can get full pay and still make a phased return. They've also said if full time proves too much ( I am 61 after all) I could cut my hours down which as I'm the deputy manager is good of them. I have had so much support throughout all this I feel very lucky in that way. Family friends and colleagues have been great, and having here to unburden myself when needed has been wonderfull.

I'm on my 5th lot of chemo now and I won't say it's easy. My second op was on Christmas Eve, they actually had to remove an affected lymph node from my breast as well, right next to the initial lump, I had three others affected in my armpit as well. I didn't go with the cold cap either as I heard it could cause headaches and I get migraines anyway. I didn't get a wig but lots of hats and have not found hair loss as much of an issue as I thought I would. It's growing back slowly now, and I quite like my bit of white fuzz. I don't think anyone deserves cancer but the important thing is it is treatable. Take it a day at a time, rest when you need to, and accept any help that is offered. I hope it all goes as well as it can for you, and don't be afraid to moan on here on your bad days. Kath",

My treatment ended about four months ago and I've still got no appetite to speak of and everything tastes bad. I'm back at work and get very tired and don't feel like cooking much either. My husband doesn't need me to cook for him so no real incentive. I've now lost 4 stone, but am still slowly losing more. I know anastrozole can cause lack of appetite as well so could be that as well. Do your taste buds ever get over the shock as I really miss chocolate etc. can't eat anything sweet. Can't have any sweet drinks. I am not sorry to have lost weight but I'm not trying to and it's still continuing. Kath",
