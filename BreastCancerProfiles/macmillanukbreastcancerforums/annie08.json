    "Content": "Its very early days for you, so don't despair. Although I had different chemo, I felt the same as you after my treatment finished in September, had a lot of joint pain, aching legs, feet, arms and back, and couldn't walk far without aching all over. I would also sieze up if I sat for too long, so would get up and wander about regularly. I was advised by one of the Macmillan nurses on this site not to push myself and listen to my body, just doing gentle exercise until I felt better. The good news is that it does gradually start to ease. I still get some joint pain in my back/hips and my feet ache in the mornings, but when I think back to about November and where I am now, I have improved so much. On the advice of a physiotherapist, I take glucosamine optiflex for my joints, which may well have helped me, although its always hard to know whether something's helping or whether you'd have felt better anyway. Have a chat with your GP and see if he can come up with anything to help you. I was given Diclofenac for a while which seemed to help too. Good luck x",
