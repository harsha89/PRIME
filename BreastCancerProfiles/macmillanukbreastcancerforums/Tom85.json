    "Content": "Days 8 - 15 of your cycle is when your white blood cell count is at it lowest.  - I would say it's not worth the risk during that time. I picked up an infection during my chemo and was made priority one in majors A& E, three days in hospital with a constant antibiotic drips, it was not a nice experience at all, in fact, i was in alot of trouble and if i'd not gone to A&E I may not be here today. temp spiked over 40, heart rate to 160 and blood pressure dropped 60 over 40!  If you do go ahead, like Donna has said, routine washing of hands, don't change nappies, don't touch your face unless you've just washed your hands etc. The decision, unfortunately, is yours to make. All the very best Tom",
