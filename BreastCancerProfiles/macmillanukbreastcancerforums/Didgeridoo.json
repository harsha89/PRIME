    "Content": "Hi Jules Hope you are not suffering too badly from the first chemo, the anticipation of what side effects you will get I think is the worst part. I had a Central line fitted 4 days before my first of 6 chemo sessions and as I am also having 18 doses Herceptin every 3 weeks for 12 months I had already looked into it so was ready to ask for it when I went for a consultation. I always struggled as a blood donor when donating blood using my left arm as the veins disappear when needles are intriduced but with a right side mastectomy in February - using the right side should be avoided. On the morning of the fitting I did have a cannula put in and was sedated slightly but was awake throughout the procedure, done in a special room with xray and monitoring equipment and I can say that I have not had a problem with it at all.  I went home about 5 hours later after some lunch.  No-one can see anything, as it is all concealed within the bra area and I am pleased I had one fitted, it saves all the hassle of trying to find veins especially if you don't like needles. The district nurse comes once a week to flush it and change the dressings and also take the blood before chemo, all straight forward. I don't mind needles at all, and once the chemo is over, and Herceptin starts, I will be trained to flush the line myself as I intend going back to work.  Hope this helps.  ",
