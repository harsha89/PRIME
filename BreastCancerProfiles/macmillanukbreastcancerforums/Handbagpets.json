    "Content": "Hi there, I went through the same thing 8 weeks ago, so I know where.you.are.coming.from. You.have made one of the big decisions by seeing your gp. My tests were pretty quick. Mammogram straight to ultrasound and as I needed biopsies I was given the choice to have them there and then or come back, I had them done and it doesn't hurt. The whole thing took 90 mins it is the waiting for the results which is worse. Keep your chin up and concentrate on your family",
