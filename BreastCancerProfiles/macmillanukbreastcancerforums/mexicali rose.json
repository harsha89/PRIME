    "Content": "Taralou,  the most comfy thing, the fringe bang attachment.  It attaches to a headband with Velcro. Bought them on line at Headcovers Unlimited.  Wigs I had on hand are inexpensive and I can only wear for a few hours - they itch and feel too tight. But love the little bit of hair with the bangs look. And it\u2019s a small investment compared to a good wig.",
