      "Content": "Yes, Mr Ramus did my surgery. He is not the most approachable man but knows what he is doing. You are in good hands. I have a large lumpectomy scar under my breast and one under my arm for the lymph node clearance. That was on 24th March. What op are you having? What I would say is that you should not expect too much of yourself afterwards. I am a fairly fit active person and was expecting a quicker recovery. Everyone is different though. I am still not driving due to lack of movement in my arm. That is frustrating. Take all offers of help from family and friends. I was very frightened before my op too. Make sure you have someone with you until you go off to theatre. I wasn't given a pre-op sedative, so it helped to have someone to talk to, to distract me a bit. When I came back from theatres I didn't want to talk to anyone! Keep in touch, any time, Carole x",
