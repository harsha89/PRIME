      "Content": "Hi  I had my final chemo dose this morning, which was  reduced by 20% as they were concerned about the impact on me. I\u2019ve been feeling increasingly exhausted, achy, numb fingers and toes, oral thrush and abdominal pain.  I rang that bell so hard I think the whole cancer centre heard it and got a cheer!  Am bracing myself for side effects but hopefully these will be at least 20% reduced too. I have been armed with more meds to assist- found a week\u2019s sleeping tablets really helped last time, at least I was getting a good nights sleep which helped my sanity! My thoughts are with you all for the rest of your chemo- hope it\u2019s bearable, if I managed it I\u2019m sure you can too. Stay strong  Sunnycat",

      "Content": "Hi Thank you ladies for your kind words of support- it means a lot.  PS How could I forgotten to mention my hair loss! My hair started falling out on day 17 after first FEC dose (the day after my mum\u2019s memorial service - yes 2018 has been the worst crxxxst year of my life) - I lost most of my head hair, just a few strands which I cut off, I have a variety of hats and a wig. Can\u2019t wait for it to grow back - I had long curly thick hair! Other body hair has also fallen out, most of my eye brows and all of my eye lashes apart from 2 on one eye - my eyes constantly water when I go out which made them sore and puffy - I used over the counter optrex and put slices of cucumber on my eyes at home which was soothing and helped with the.puffiness. They said my hair would start to grow back after I\u2019d finished the FEC - much to my disappointment no signs yet. ",

      "Content": "Hi  I found the best way to deal with this roller coaster journey was to take it a step at a time- it was too overwhelming to take it all in. I had 3 doses of DEC and then D (last one yesterday). Unfortunately I suffered many extreme side effects- see my other post.  I tried not to think too far ahead and concentrated on my current situation- it helped me get through so far.  I have a break now over the festive season and start radiotherapy in January and start hormone tablets in 2 weeks time.  I can\u2019t remember looking forward to Christmas and New Year so much since I was a little girl!  Although I will miss my mum terribly- the first without her.  Good is luck with your treatment- stay strong you can get through this. ",

      "Content": "Hi I've spoken to the bc nurse and they've made a note of my holiday dates and said they will work apts around them. I have my post op apt this Friday and then will have oncology apt afterwards before further treatment starts. They said my treatment may be delayed by a week which won't make a difference.  I want my daughter to enjoy her summer holiday and could do with getting away myself before chemo starts.  I tried to respond to this post earlier but due to the site tech problems couldn't post - very frustrating!  Best wishes, hope all goes well for you x ",

      "Content": "Hi - I have opted for delayed reconstruction, I had a mastectomy and auxiliary clearance on 14th June. I will need further treatment of chemo and radiotherapy and had a consultation with both mastectomy surgeon and breast reconstruction surgeon prior to making my decision. I was told there was a high chance of damage due to the ongoing treatment, my focus has been on getting rid of the cancer first, so I've chosen to delay. However this is a personal choice and you need to get all the information you can before you make yours.  Best wishes and take care xx",
