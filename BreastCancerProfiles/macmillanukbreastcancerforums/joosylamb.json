    "Content": "Hi Tessa sorry to hear about the effects of rads. I was also effected in this way had 3 weeping sores which became one large one. Radiotherapy nurses at the WGH in Edinburgh gave me Proflavine Solution in sodium chloride. Within a week the sores had dried out, the only side effect was it turned whatever it touched yellow and it did nip a bit when applied but made a world of difference. Try not to wear any bra or top in the evening and let the air get at it,. I know it's not a practical thing to do but do it when you get the chance. Good luck with the rest of your treatment Â  Joosylamb",
