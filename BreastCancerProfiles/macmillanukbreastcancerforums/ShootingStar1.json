    "Content": "Ihi I had a lumpectomy & sentinel node biopsy on 14 Sept and just got results showing it was grade 3 (9/9) IDC which had spread to lymph (4mm) but as only one node was taken they don't know if more are affected. I have the choice of another op on 19 Oct to remove axillary lymph nodes or to proceed with treatment. I know the NICE guidelines advise treatment starts with I think 31 days of surgery as research showed people who had stage 2 cancer had a 20% better 5 year survival rate than those who started after 61 days so I am worried about delaying treatment with another op Â - can treatment alone gradekill off any cancer in lymph? I'm so confused and don't know what to do!",
