      "Content": "Hi I've just received a letter which suggest a radiotherapy planning appointment in Bristol but with treatment in Bath. I don't live in either place and was told I would be seen in Bristol I'm really upset about the Bath bit as its 44 miles each way from where I live 88 miles round trip. As I will be on my own for appointments I can' t do 80 miles and be knackered and be on public transport if i can't drive. I think that's unreasonable and I'm not going. If I'd of known I'd have had a mastectomy not a WLE. I'm hoping that somebody could confirm  that I can ask for this to be changed as I can't get to Bath. Really upset about this and had coped ok until now. I have contacted breast cancer nurse  and I'm hoping this is a hideous mistake. Thanks",
