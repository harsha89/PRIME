    "Content": "My husband is going into week 5 of radio and chemo for bowel cancer and is still at work and doing overtime,he said it is helping him to keep things as normal as possible.He is very tired but says if it gets too tiring he will stop but whatever helps I suppose,he has been better than me !!But I am glad he is coping this way,you just do what you have to and take care.
