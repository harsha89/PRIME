      "Content": "CBR, First the usual caveat - everybody is different... I had a mastectomy in October 2007 and in the first couple of months, I could actually make the fluid slop along the scar area. Do keep an eye on your scar area because fluid can give an infection there at any stage, so watch out for any unusual pain and tenderness with redness in that area. I had that in May 2008, after chemo finished, and the scar ballooned like half a rugby ball and probuced an abscess in the middle of the scar. That required a draining operation and two months of packed open wound before I was fit enough for radiotherapy. From what I can make out, feeling like a mutant with a cast iron plate inserted in your chest and your arm socket encased in concrete is a \"normal feeling\". 14 months after the op, I still have a \"heavy\" shoulder blade and light \"nettle rash\" feeling in the part of my upper arm which isn't numb, but the concrete cone round my arm socket is about a quarter of how it used to be. Something else which was never mentioned to me is that when you move your good arm, your breast slides out of the way, but at some point, when the chest scar fluid has gone (say 6 months or so) the scar section sticks down to your chest / ribs. Then it no longer slides out of the way when you bring your arm forward, but creases and folds instead. I assume that reconstruction overcomes this but I'm a man so it wasn't an option... Worryingly, the swelling feeling in the armpit ( a hot mini-Vesuvius under there?) can return and I haven't figured out if it is caused by physical exertion or possibly alcohol (No! please No!). So I'm 10 months ahead of you and still waiting for clothes to fit comfortably - tight silk short sleeve vests are good. I have a Boxer 1150RS which is still too heavy to ride (or manouvre) too much but I can ride a Thrux 900 OK, though my one piece textile suit is tight under the arm (yes I do mean the arm, not the Rossi adjustment area). I think that if anything vibrations are a help, but I am on Herceptin which gives fiery joint feelings and my wrists and fingers can't take too much riding yet. I do exercises at any opportunity but other than ensuring freedom of movement, the fluid is not really \"pumped away\" or anything. Beware also of phantom feelings, that volcano that your arm comes out of and that huge mountain that rubs on your inner arm (unless weraing a bra cures that, I wouldn't know) are nowhere near as big as they feel, so you need a mental adjustment to the new you, and try and ignore it. Sorry I can't say how soon it disappears, beacuse I'm still waiting, but it does get easier. Still, the silver lining is that 675 Street Triples are much lighter and there is no waiting list now. Good luck and keep moving that arm. Thrup x.",

In many ways, breast cancer is easy to talk about - even for a man like me. It is not so easy to discuss problems with bowel or urinary system and when it is tongue, mouth or throat it is just difficult to talk. When my wife was in hospital for tongue cancer, the women from our church formed a rota and brought meals every day to take away one burden - and the children were fed better than normally. The church was equally supportive during my breast cancer treatment and is now organising a transport rota for my wife to have RT & Chemo on a recurrence of mouth cancer, so that I can continue to work for the 6 week period without taking huge amounts of time off. Sharing and being honest about conditions is not whinging, and it allows others to show how much they care in any way that suits them.",

It is now 17 months since my operation and some days I am still troubled by the feeling that I am carrying a hot, hard, ball just below my armpit. Since I don't wear a bra the end of my scar, which is raised out to my side, can rub on my inner arm - which is really annoying. getting hot while walking is very annoying too as the hot ball feeling is worse. I have tried wearing tight tee shirts and silk vests but would just like to know if any of you experience similar feelings. I also have phantom \"thick\" shoulderblade feelings but I put that down to some fluid retention. Finally, where a normal breast moves nicely out of the way when you move your arm, the centre 2\" of my scar is firmly stuck to my chest and doesn't slide anywhere, it just creases almost vertically at that point. Is this normal for any women who have not had reconstruction? If I knew what normal was I could aim for it....",

      "Content": "I hate to say this but in the week following chemo I could hardly tell the difference between tea and coffee. For hot drinks I ended up drinking horlicks and I'm usually a tea drinker. Everything tasted slimy, because my mucus membranes were so thin, and my tongue and mouth were so sensitive that I couldn't even eat an apple because the acid stung my mouth and gums. Every drink that I tried was a disappointment and I just kept a large bottle of boiled water in the fridge to have with ribena or similar; I think the coldness was the best thing because taste didn't matter as much as feeling refreshed. Food was just tasteless. I knew if it was sweet or savoury but that is all and ice-cream just tasted awful. Food was just a necessary evil because I was always afraid starting a bout of hiccoughs (which really hurts your stomach, chest and gullet if you have it for over an hour). Chemo treatments seem to take over your life, beforehand you worry if your blood cell count will be good enough so that the treatment won't be delayed and afterwards, you count the days until the next one and plan any social activities for the last few days of the cycle when you will have the most energy and interest. My biggest help was knowing that my wife was always there, or I could phone her, and knowing that she would listen to every whinge and complaint. A good friend is a good listener who doesn't plan anything for you but just goes along with what you feel like doing. I think most people having chemo don't have long term thoughts and fears, just getting through the day with your fears of being sick or hiccoughs etc is enough to think about, so your long term anxiety would probably be lost on your friend anyway. It really is a case of one day at a time because you never really know how you will feel tomorrow. Just being available is your most precious gift to your friend and it really will be appreciated. I love my wife for the long hours she spent with me in waiting rooms and treatment rooms - just being there for me was really precious.",

      "Content": "It would be a brave specialist who diagnosed cancer without several different indications. A mamogram is quite a crude x-ray and shows density but not size, not least because your breast is being squashed at the time (my tumour felt like a frozen pea size - approx 4mm, but after surgery was measured at 22mm). A needle biopsy requires incredible accuracy abd a fair bit of luck to obtain a meaningful sample (mine was inconclusive). Ultrasound gives a better picture than a mammogram but still needs a lot of interpretation (mine implied a tumour). My specialist then had 2 out of 3 indicators but needed a core biopsy to be sure. (this proved positive for me). After all this, my specialist did not give me a size - because tumours don't have sharply defined margins and the (literal) grey area is open to interpretation. An MRI scan should indicate abnormality in sentinal lymph nodes (the nearest ones to the tumour) but this too is open to interpretation. If the breast cancer is seen to be large, it is fair to assume that lymph nodes are affected but the question is, how many? It seems to me that what you see as careless is probably an attempt by the specialist to avoid a mastectomy and lymph node removal, but the size of the tumour and the sentinel node biopsy makes complete removal the only option. You need to understand that everything has a risk, the reason that a core biopsy isn't a first line check even though it is more accurate than a neddle biopsy, is that stabbing a blade into a tumour and wiping it through the flesh and skin on the way out, does caryy a risk of actually spreading the cancer! So there are two major factors in diagnosis, Risk and Cost. It would obviously be easier just to take evrybody with a dodgy mamogam in and do a mastectomy, but the specialist has to go through several stages of investigation before reaching a full diagnosis. In the long run, the size of the tumour or its location matters less than how fast it is spreading. Dont be fooled into relying on technology, magnetic resonance scanners are simply the latest type of echo sounder and a laser is only the latest thing in knives. This applies to radiotherapy machines (actually linear accelerators), the best ones are the most accurately controlled ones, it is always better to be hit with a needle rather than a sledge hammer - there is les colateral damage. Finally, always take notes at every consultation. Specialists are quite happy about this and will even spell medical terms out for you, and no-one's memory is perfect. I wish you good luck, but cancer surgery and treatment is not an exact science",

      "Content": "Avie, You have made some assumptions which I feel I aught to correct: \u201cfull node clearance\u201d \u2013 you have dozens of nodes, 5 is a small sample of those nearest to the tumour. \u201cSure it hadn\u2019t spread\u201d \u2013 no-one can be sure, which is why they are going to give chemotherapy on your whole body, to chase any cancer down and destroy it. If you really want to know more, I have some thoughts for you. ADVICE You have been given good advice: Write it down \u2013 at this and every meeting with a consultant. Make them spell names of drugs and medical terms. They don\u2019t mind and it will help you to understand what is happening. You must write down about drugs too. Some anti-sickness drugs should be taken before the chemo dose, so that it is already in your system. Some drugs are steroids (dexomethasone is a corticosteroid) and need to be taken before 16:00 or you won\u2019t get a good night\u2018s sleep Some drugs are to prevent acid reflux in the stomach \u2013 and cannot be taken with common indigestion remedies or with certain \u201cbrain\u201d drugs like SSRI\u2019s (valium?) So take a list of all your prescription and favoured non-prescription drugs to ask if they are compatible. Ask about your diagnosis and staging and write it down. The staging (how far your cancer has developed) is derived from the size of the tumour, the number of nodes affected etc. Sometimes this is given as a TNM classification T = Tumour size N = which lymph nodes have cancer in them M = Metastasis (cancer spread beyond lymphs) I had a 22mm tumour, 3/10 cancerous lymph nodes and no apparent spread beyond that, giving me a TNM of T2N1M0 TNM and What it means T (tumour) Tis Your breast cancer hasn't spread beyond the lining of the ducts. It's called carcinoma in situ. T1 Your breast cancer is 2 centimetres (0.8 inches) or less across. T2 Your breast cancer is more than 2 centimetres (0.8 inches) across but no bigger than 5 centimetres (2 inches) across. T3 Your breast cancer is bigger than 5 centimetres (2 inches) across. T4 Your tumour extends from the breast into the chest wall and/or the skin, and/or is inflammatory. (Inflammatory cancer is a rare, invasive cancer that can block the lymph vessels in the skin over the breast.) N (nodes) N0 Your breast cancer hasn't spread to the nearest (local) lymph nodes. N1 Your breast cancer has spread to the lymph nodes on the same side of your body as your breast cancer, and these can be moved around (they aren't matted together by the cancer). N2 Your breast cancer has spread to the lymph nodes on the same side of your body as your breast cancer, and these can't be moved around (they are matted together). N3 Your breast cancer has spread to lymph nodes towards the middle of your chest (the internal mammary nodes) on the same side as your breast cancer. M (metastasis) M0 Your breast cancer hasn't spread to another part of your body. M1 Your breast cancer has spread to another part of your body. (This may mean it has spread to lymph nodes above the collarbone on the same side of your body as your breast cancer.) The Oncologist decides your treatment based on these criteria. Cycles \u2013 blood tests Before every cycle is given, you will need a blood test, often at your local doctor\u2019s. By the time the nurse that does this turns up, you can write off one morning. You need the test to be as late as possible in the cycle, or your blood won\u2019t have recovered enough for the next treatment. Scans You should have CT / MRI / ECG to ensure that there is \u201cbaseline\u201d information to compare with scanresults later and to ensure that there is no obvious cancer spread. The ECG is to give a baseline and later checks to make sure your heart is not affected by the treatment. Trials The Oncologist may mention \u201ctrials\u201d and ask if you are willing to take part in any suitable ones and the normal reaction is to say yes, purely for the good of mankind etc. There was an odd phrase written on my diagnosis which said \u201cmay be suitable for TACT2 I hoped that this didn\u2019t mean anything nasty and asked the oncologist what it meant. It was a trial of accelerated chemotherapy for oestrogen negative patients. I am oestrogen positive and thus suitable for Herceptin but not for that trial. I later read of people who were so happy to have much shorter treatments (3 instead of 6) as they would suffer less side effects and get on with their lives sooner. But my treatment was successfully trialled on 2000 French women in 1999 and their 5 year survival was excellent (3 x FEC + 3 x Taxotere), so I know that it is usually effective. How would I feel if I went on a reduced chemo trial and had a secondary 2 years later? Would I regret taking part in a trial? So just think long and hard about any new, untried or shorter treatments before agreeing, and ask what trial your suggested treatment is based on and the 5 year survival rates - if any. Finally, we are all individuals and the oncologist should be treating you as an individual, so internet or forum comparisons with other peoples treatment doesn\u2019t work out very well. If you search the internet too much you can really scare yourself unnecessarily. I am now 13 months from mastectomy, on Herceptin and doing well. Good luck and best wishes for a complete remission.",

Pagets disease is a very specific disease which may or may not produce Breast Cancer. I have a \"rare\" Breast Cancer but mine is only rare because its occurence is in a man. However relative rarity makes no difference to breast cancer treatment; I do not have \"male breast cancer\" I have breast cancer of the interductal carcinoma type. Your mother's would not be a secondary cancer, as its source and primary site are in the same place as the tumour. A PET scan alone does not confirm cancer, biopsies confirm cancer by type and stage. Cancer is not \"curable\". A cancer may be surgically removed, shrunk by chemicals or atrophied by radiation bombardment, but not cured; that is why when our treatment is completed we are only ever in \"remission\", never cured. The course of action will depend on the type, staging and spread of the cancer and will probably be a combination of surgery and chemotherapy with possible radiotherapy - whatever the consultant and ocologist decide as the most effective treatment. Outcome depends on: Age of patient, general health of patient to withstand treatment, size of tumour, spread of cancer and aggressiveness of cancer type. There is no \"remedy\" or quick fix in cancer and it is not just one battle, your mother has just embarked on a life-long campaign. So how to get help? Understand the diagnosis and the treatment, then you can ask specific questions of people that have been through similar situations. You don't need to be an expert in medical acronyms or shorthand, just say what you know and ask what you don't know. Speaking as both a sufferer and a carer, your job is to find out as much as you can about your mother's current state and her actual diagnosis, make notes of every meeting, every drug and treatment prescribed and understand how the prescribed treatment or surgery works. Then support your mother through the tough times ahead and remember that quality of life is as important as length of life. Wishing you every success in the treatment and outcome.",

Make up a list of questions, add to it when you think of more things, then make a copy before you see your consultant / oncologist. When you attend an appointment for any treatment give them the questions and then make sure you write down the answers. this will help you later when you mull things over. Write on your list in big letters: Options? ask about the schedules, treatments, side effects, long term effects, predicted outcomes - and any options for each point.

I could be wrong, and apologise in advance if I am, but most statistics are for 5 year non-recurrence/survival and there are less statistics for 10 years and very few statistics for fulfilment of life expectancy; mainly because there are so many variables and we all eventually die of something or other failing. So before you dismiss the treatment on offer, you are balancing 6 months nuisance and a further 6 months recovery against a potential national average life expectancy of 32 more years in your case. I wouldn't want to advise you in either direction, but do please be sure that your quoted statistics are applicable to your age, gender and general health, and that the prognosis is 32 year survival rather than 5 years. The tricky part of all your calculations is that life is unpredictable. Only 1% of men get breast cancer but I fell into that 1%.
