      "Content": "Hi there,  I'm 26 and recently found a lump in my left breast just over a week ago, got seen very quickly by my GP who also found a thickening in the right breast too (which I hadn't noticed when checking myself) My referral has been booked in for Tuesday June 12th. I just wondered if there was anyone a similar age to myself that's been through this referral process? Someone told me I won't need a mammogram as I'm under 35, and now I just don't know what to expect... I do know however that I'm catching myself worrying about every possible outcome, and not really knowing where to turn. I don't want to worry people by telling them (especially as right now technically there's nothing to worry about) and the couple I have told just seemed to brush it of as 'nothing to worry about'  If anyone could share their experience with me, I'd really appreciate it x (Did post this in the new to site thread, so apologies probably should have put it here first, blame my head being all over the place right now!)",

      "Content": "Thank you so much for your kind words and info, it really means a lot.  My GP was very thorough with my examination, but I didn\u2019t really have time left in my appointment to ask about the referral procedure (also my mind was somewhere else totally once she\u2019d confirmed the lump and found the other thing)  It sounds so silly and naive of me, but I hadn\u2019t really thought at a relatively young age I\u2019d find anything like this.  Trying to stay positive  ",

I've come home with good news, a fibroadenoma! All fine for now to be left as is (just supposed to keep an eye out for any changes over time) Feeling very lucky x",
