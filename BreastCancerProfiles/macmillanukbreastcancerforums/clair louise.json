My surgeon sought the assistance of another surgeon that deals with recon. tho, im up and down at the min. every so often become so so exhausted, something i have never experienced as i have only ever had 1 operation. im unsure what i can and cant or should or shouldnt do. i am very independant and kills me i cant jump up and tidy or get in my car to get some shopping in! im getting my node results a week monday so now im worrying over that. im fretting over money too as i have only been in my current job 6 months so i wont get much of my time off on full pay..... I guess im just curious as to how others deal with this 1st couple of weeks after their op...? if anyone has any advice or what not it would be great to hear x",

I had my 3rd chemo wed 20th april but i have been using the cold cap so i still have my hair. however, i can relate to how you are feeling right now. i posted something so similar. 18 days after i had my 1st chemo i started to lose my hair. id had it cut short to a pixie style so that when i used the cold cap there would be less pressure on my roots/folicles. nothing will ever quite prepare you (no matter how 'ok' you are with losing your hair) for that initial hair loss. i too felt really down about it and just spent far too much time running my fingers thru my hair panicking. what have you got for yourself? i have a wig, several bandanas (pls go to the website 'anna bandana' excellent quality and brill prices....and some really funky ideas) and i have a few wider head bands. like i said i had cold cap so i may not be in the exact position, i just hope you feel better soon. Many lovely ladies on here have gave me super advice so listen to it and use this fantastic website. chin up and remember its not forever....accessorize and work scarves, bandanas into your new chic look.... xxx",

I had a massive shock when i was diagnosed, im 30 and healthy!! but i guess that doesnt count when it comes to cancer. My dads mum had breast cancer in her 60's (1994 ish) but the doctors didnt count that as family history....??? I had a little hard lump. sometimes really easy to locate and other times couldnt feel it at all and my mammogram didnt show anything! so, i was sent for an ultra sound and i had a peek and i knew it would be treated as suspicious (but doesnt always mean CANCER). anyway, im such a soft arse i wouldn hav put me down as a brave person but i promise u, u find strength and just get through it. accept all your loved ones support with open arms (even if they do at times badger u for reassurance). fingers crossed u get good news!!! though, i bet you have still had such a shock, all the waiting and hospital visits.

I was given the option of having chemo, the oncologist pushed it a little as a ''mopping up'' then radio 3 weeks after chemo ends. I was terrified but found this site so helpful...ask questions and listen to the advice...i swear these lovely people have helped me so much! i had my 1st chemo (EC) 9th march with my 2nd tomorrow (4 in total) and out of all i have been through it was the chemo i was most frightened about. I came on here and got some really good advice about anything i was worried about at the time so ask away!!! Everyone does react different to the chemo. I got the cold cap 1st. I decided i wanted to try save my hair. 3 weeks later a little has begun to come out but its just thinned a bit. I have an excellent wig and snazzy head wear from a site called Anna Bandana (try it out, fab quality and very good prices). Im loving being the chilled out hippy chick these days haha!!! After i got home from my 1st chemo i was just a little groggy. had something to eat and a nap. i woke up sickly and i was sick, just once. then for the next few days i just felt hungover! bit of a sore throat and the odd mouth ulcer but nothing too unpleasant. after about a week i was fine! even went to a footy match!!! haha! armed with my hand sanitiser of course! last week i went out for my pals bday (no hard partying but still i got out the house!!!). im like you, i am a realist and find myself saying to myself  'just get on with it Mrs, get it out the way'...but we all have thoughts and feelings and you're allowed to have a cry and a rant...i certainly do!! my poor boyfriend just lets me get on with it and is there for me when im done!!! hahaha! Stay away from websites u dont know, if u want advice use this site or reputable ones such as NHS or Cancer Care. last thing u want to do is terrify yourself!!! when u start your treatment u will get lots of info on it all! hope you feel better soon xxx clair xxx",

      "Content": "HI all. Im currently undergoing my EC chemo. Im only having the 4. 3rd next week so i have estimated last chemo 11th May. Im just curious about the RT. All i have thought about or concentrated on for the last few month is the chemo and i have just realised i know nothing at all about the Radio! How soon after last Chemo does it usually start, i discussed it briefly with BCN and recall her saying 3 weeks after last chemo but that was her guessing have questions flying round my tired brain....! how long are the sessions, how to they make u feel, side affects and advice on getting through it. I would greatly appreciate your advice.... clair xxx",

Its a good way to see it, the next part to getting my life back. after radio i just need to decide on recon or not. probs will but i have all the time in the world to worry about that. yes you do put things into perspective and see the other side of life. whether its spending time going back and forth to hospital or battling the government to get financial help!!! so the tats dont really concern me i guess. take care everyone xxx",

      "Content": "thanks ladies! i bit the bullet and got a mild dye on my hair and teased it a little with my straighteners. then yesterday i went out with my boyfriend and straightened my hair and used a bit of hair wax! i felt just like the old ME (the old me with a really funky pixie cut that i probs will keep)!!! jane, my advice is to use the cold cap from day 1! make sure its really snug on your head so that each folicle gets chilly!!! i took 2 paracetemol and ibuprofen to take the edge off! also took scarves to put round my neck to keep the cold drips off. the nurse put gauze on my ears and forehead. please persevere as the 1st 20 mins is quite uncomfortable and a very bizarre feeling! 2 and a half weeks after my 1st chemo i started losing my hair but not so u could notice. some ppl just wet their hair and let it cleanse itself but i found a fab product called NAKED. its sold in Boots Chemist and is 97% organic and my chemo nurses recommended it. its so mild and can be used thru chemo. take care and keep in touch xxx",
