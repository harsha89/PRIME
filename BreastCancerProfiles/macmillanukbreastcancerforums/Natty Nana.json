      "Content": "Hello all-I'be popped over here from the Bowel Cancer group I think this is an issue that affects us all once we've been cursed with this terrible disease-in my opinion no Cancer is better or worse-Cancer Sucks. Prior to discovering I'd got a huge tumour in my colon I found sex to be very painful and unusually for me did not want it as much simply because it hurt so bad (I thought for a year I'd got a bad bladder infection) From day 1 of being diagnosed with bowel Cancer sex has simply been off the menu for physical reasons...that was and still is devastating for me and obviously for my hubby  (I'm 54 he's 47) even more so with the added attraction (NOT) of an ileostomy . im not ME anymore and that special closeness which was a huge part of our life has literally been snuffed out. It made me not want to live in those first dark days in hospital and I cried a LOT. i love my hubby to the end of the world and he is my Life-this horrid horrid Cancer has ruined our life in that respect and any sort of intimacy is out of the question as anyone who has an active stoma will probably agree I'm sure. As Lynda Bellingham described in her autobiography the thought of bending over the bathroom sink whilst your husband is banging away from behind with a bag of shit hanging down from your belly swinging away is hardly condusive to tomance-say no more.  My hubby loves me to bits and he gets so angry that this has happened to me and I don't think that frustration helps neither. I know I've got a lovely man who's struggling to cope-letting him take charge of my care helps a lot . Life can be so cruel can't it. And Libido....what's that? Lol Ive got a lovely McMillan nurse who is arranging for me to see a counseller as I'm not really coping very well deep down inside but I try to deal with it with humour .. But it's not funny and it's not nice and it's so not fair...to us all ... kind regards  Wendy  x ps: although I do have the happy knowledge that on holiday in Menorxa last July,we broke the settee....!",

      "Content": "I was bleach blonde and loved it but my hair started to go much thinner although having bowel cancer the chemo drugs aren't supposed to make me lose my hair .... anyway-well done Ali Owl for dying yours! My hubby told me to a. Get it cropped shorter and b. To go RED instead of blonde as bleach too harsh Ivet been all manner of colours before but have been blonde for so long but am now loving my new red head as somehow it's taken that stage of my life with cancer away from the 'me' that was before.... Think of ourselves as butterflies....we can change and be beautiful...with whatever colour we choose (as long as it's organic,natural,ammonia free and vegetable dye lol!!) Haha!!! Who says blondes have more fun?  Kind regards to all Natty xx",

      "Content": "Hi Ladies (hope you don't mind me popping over from bowel group?)  I'm on 5FU for bowel Cancer (Oxaliaplatin stopped due to peripheral neuropathy  on 2nd cycle)... my fingers were extremely sore with electric shocks-now I'm noticing that my nails (which grew beautifully during my hospital stay during resection of bowel and ileostomy)-first Xmas I didn't need falsies!! Well they've ALL but broken off right down to the quick and the ends of my fingers are are sore and the edges are splitting. not good is it-after everything else we go through. Makes tasks that much more fiddly and difficult (not to mention painful)! Been putting on lavender cuticle oil and using lashings of hand and nail cream then Sally Hansons Nail & Britlleness solver...am hoping that helps. kind regards to you all. Wendy x",
