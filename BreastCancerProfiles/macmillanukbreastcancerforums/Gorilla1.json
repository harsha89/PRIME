      "Content": "Hi Rose, Carl is on 120 twice a day, 12 hours apart.  Before that he was on 120 once a day, then 80 twice a day but as the stents not worked he had to have increase to 12o twice a day and that has only been for 3 weeks now but with good results so far. Fingers crossed.  He had to have blood tests all the time.",

      "Content": "Hi, sorry to jump in here if your situation has already been resolved but we have a little experience of injecting with clexane for clots. Hubby has massive lung cancer tumour that caused obstruction to superior vena cava and clots under each arm, which caused significant oedema in both arms and hands.  Had stents for SVOC but they didnt work so the clexane was increased and after 6 weeks the oedema has gone down and his arms are no longer leaking fluid so for him it is worth carrying on as he no longer feels like \"Aqua Man\" and it is worth the risk of \"bleeding out\" - still a bit scary for me injecting him twice a day but it does seem to have worked for him so far.  Wishing you the very best.  x",
