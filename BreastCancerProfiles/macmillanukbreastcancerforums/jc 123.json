    "Content": "Hi, popped over from lc site, I've just had my 2nd chemo of Docetaxel, 2 days after my 1st chemo had for 5 days a dreadful headache, felt like severe tension in my head and down my neck, looks as if number 2 is going the same way! I'm also having to inject myself after 24 hrs of chemo to boost white cells etc, that also has a side effect of a headache and steroids don't suit me either. Did find a warm wheat bag around my neck helped a little, soluable paracetamol is gentler on the stomach too. Is this your mums 1st session? Hope she starts to feel better soon",
