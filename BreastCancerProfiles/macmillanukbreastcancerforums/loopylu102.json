      "Content": "Hi  I had stage 3b invasive lobular cancer. I have finished treatment and am very well thankfully. Initially I was told I would have an mri every year as it is better at picking up lobular cancers but now I'm only having a mammogram.  Can anybody tell me what follow up they have after lobular cancer. I'm a bit worried this change may be due to budgetary constraints.    Many thanks in anticipation ",

      "Content": "Hi Carol, i am being treated with tamoxifen to shrink the tumour  pre surgery and have also lost my sense of smell. It was completely gone for about 6 weeks but i have noticed it i am getting very faint whiffs of things and can smell some food cooking now. I had never realized how important smell was for your appetite because without it i couldnt taste anything except salty food and had no appetite at all.  I am not on anything else at the moment so am guessing it is tamoxifen which is causing this. Best wishes ",

I was wondering how you got on during the year. I am finding it difficult to just wait for the tamoxifen to work. I feel i should be doing something more proactive. I would love to hear how you got on.  ",
