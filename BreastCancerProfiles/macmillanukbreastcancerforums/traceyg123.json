      "Content": "Hi all, I am 44 and have just been diagnosed with triple negative breast cancer, The cancer has spread throughout the breast so i need a full mast and lymph node removal . The mastecomy feels like my worst night mare. im quite big in the breast area and feel the impact to much to bare.I can't have reconstuction due to where the lumps are and the treatment required afterwards. I dont mean to sound selfish i know hundreds of people on here are suffering too ,i just cant get my head round it all. im trying to be strong in front of family and friends but as the operation date approaches im struggling . people are saying the operation isnt that bad and im sure its not ,im not scared of the operation i just feel this is a mammoth operation emotionally and this is what im struggling with although i fully appreciate its a must to get rid of the cancer.  ",

I went clothes shopping today but put loads back and left in tears, good to hear i might not need a new wardrobe. Do you have to have chemo now. They said I will have chemo then radio non of that alerts me just how i will feel after the op. They have said i will be discharged the same day which is scary also . please keep in touch and i will keep you updated . sending big hugs x  ",

As the operation day approaches (21st) I am becoming more tearful and keep picturing how i will look . Like you im a big busty girl with a clevage you could hide in. My hairdresser has offered to come and take my hair off once it starts coming out and i will definatly do that . Im quite fond of tattoos and have asked my brother who is a tattooist to tattoo hair on my head once this happens .(a joke he didint find funny ) please keep me posted on your recovery big hugs tracey          ",

      "Content": "Hi All, Thanks for all your comments last week, had my mastecomy on thurs and to be honest it wasnt as bad as i thought . it is painful post op and my one dread of looking in the mirror although emotional wasnt that bad. i was sent home at 10 at night the day of my op which was scary but im glad i did now, much better  than being on a ward and getting woke up every 5 minutes to all the ladies waiting for the op , its seems scarier than it is. had all sorts of thoughts going in but 2 days after op was pottering about the house not lifting anything but organising the hubby well. a friend came and washed and straightened my hair yesterday which made me feel tons better. thanks again everyone for your support it was reading this site before going in that helped me ,some times you think things because you dont know what to expect but reading all your comments was fantastic. back at hospital thursday will keep you updated. tracey  ",
