      "Content": "Hi Coley1993 i had a right mastectomy in October this year I also had a 21mm lump ER+ no lymphnodes involvement. My Oncotype score came back at 32 so I\u2019m having adjuvant chemo but a slightly different regime to yourself. I\u2019m having 12 cycles of Paclitaxel weekly (had number 5 today) and fortunately very little in the way of side effects apart from tiredness. I\u2019m also due to have 3 cycles of EC once the Packitaxel finishes.  My chemo is preventative too. I\u2019ve not used cold cap and my hair has come out so I made the decision to cut it right down and felt much better once I had done that and I have a lovely wig I\u2019m so sorry to hear you are finding chemo hard going. I did ask the question if I didn\u2019t or couldn\u2019t finish my chemo whether it would have any benefit but they couldn\u2019t really give me a clear answer. It might be worth talking to your Oncologist to see if they could perhaps change you to an alternative chemo that might give you less side effects - they did say to me that would be an option if I was finding it difficulties to tolerate it for any reason. Your Oncotype score is low so there could be other options for you. I will be going back on Letrozole for 5-10 years once my chemo has finished.  Sending you hugs   Lynn xx",

      "Content": "Hello Georgia78 I found myself in a very similar situation to yourself. I found a lump just before a family holiday last September - had a mastectomy (my choice) with no spread to my lymphnodes but had the Oncotype DX test which showed I was at high risk of recurrence and this was a huge shock. I was advised chemotherapy to prevent it coming back and started chemo on 28 November. I\u2019ve just completed 12 weekly cycles of Paclitaxel which was doable - I did have some rubbish days but I did manage to get out most days as normal  - I got tired but coped. Just had my first EC (3x3 weekly cycles) which has hit me harder and I\u2019ve had a couple of days where I\u2019ve felt wiped out but just rested but is doable and like you I will throw everything at it to prevent it coming back in the future.  What chemo have they advised? Be guided by your body rest when you need to - take all the anti sickness tablets they give you before you feel sick as it\u2019s much easier to control before you start to feel sick.  Everyone is different and you can do this and the time goes surprisingly quickly once you start.  Sending you lots of hugs   Lynn xx",

      "Content": "Hi Georgia78  I decided not to cold cap for the reason you said about the time it adds on and I do suffer with headaches so decided against it but a few ladies that I\u2019ve met have done it and with good results. You can always give it a go and it it\u2019s not for you then there\u2019s nothing lost. I bought lots of hats and have a lovely wig and it\u2019s great being able to get ready in a matter of minutes! Losing my hair was one of the hardest things for me but to be honest it hasn\u2019t been as bad as I thought it would be - once it started coming out I took the decision to shave it down to a number 2 (hubby did it Christmas Eve) and I\u2019ve never completely lost it and in fact it has started to grow a little bit but I think it will all go with my next cycle of treatment.  They will go through everything with you at your pre chemo chat and the nurses are just so lovely and reassuring and will answer all your questions. I took a notebook with me and wrote everything down - there is so much to remember. I also invested in a digital thermometer which has been worth every penny.  Big hugs   Lynn xx",

My results came back as ER positive and I was started on Letrozole that day and told I could go on my holiday and was given a date for surgery on my return for the 11th October. We had very mixed feelings about going away but am glad that we went even though it was always at the back of my mind but I knew the Letrozole was doing it\u2019s job.

I think it will go this weekend but I\u2019m much more prepared for it now i saw the Oncologist today and she wants me to have Zolendronate next week alongside my chemo (every 6 months for 3 years) and I\u2019ve done my homework and agreed to go ahead. The side effects sound pretty rubbish but let\u2019s face it all side effects do and you don\u2019t always get them. Has anyone had Zolendronate with their chemo and what was it like. I\u2019ve been advised to take Paracetamol and Ibuprofen the day before to help with any aches and pains and my Dentist has given me the go ahead.  Thanks - Lynn xx",
