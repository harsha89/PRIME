      "Content": "Hi Chez, I saw your post and popped over from the womb cancer group. I have surgical menopause with no HRT and can relate to what's happening, I've been trying to get help for a few months and here is what I've found so far. You can be referred to a menopause clinic who will advise you on how to treat your symptoms (I'm going in a week and a half so no miracles yet). My gp was fab and printed me a menu of options which I have set aside until I've tried everything else as they all involved long term medication / supplements. You can get a copper coil which has no hormones, I don't know if it will help with the bleeding but it's worth a chat with your medical team and maybe your local birth control centre to see if that or any other options would help.Â  Finally if you feel like you are slowly loosing the plot that is normal, reach out to your team, gp, anyone who can help and even if they don't have a magic wand they will listen and offer some advice. Lots of love and I hope that you can get some treatment that helps soon. Xx",

My poor husband has just got used to me being a bit mental some days. Fingers crossed that they can at least treat your symptoms and help control the bleeding. Xx",
