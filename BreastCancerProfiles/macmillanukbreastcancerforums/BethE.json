    "Content": "Hi all, on 23rd March I was told I have breast cancer. It took quite a few days for it to sink in! I had biopsies and saw the consultant on Thursday and I have invasive lobular cancer, they think it's grade 2 and oestrogen positive. I am having a full MRI and contrast CT scan within the next 2 weeks to make sure everywhere else is clear and obtain staging etc . I'm pleased they are doing that at least we will have a clear picture of everything. I'm not sure of treatment plan until these results are through, as they are unsure of tumour size or if there is more than one. My gp has signed me off work for a couple of weeks, I'm a paediatric nurse and my ward is extremely busy and we don't always get breaks etc (however I ❤ my job and will miss it!) I think it's best for me as 13 hour shifts take their toll and I don't want to be distracted with everything that's going on whilst caring for precious kiddies! So it's 2/3 more weeks of waiting for me but I'd rather they do a full MOT before they get their hands on me!! Any advice is very welcome!  I will beat this alongside all of you lovely people . Thanks Beth xx",
