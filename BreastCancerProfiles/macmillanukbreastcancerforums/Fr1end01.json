      "Content": "Dear All A friend of mine has just been diagnosed with breast cancer. Can anyone recommend a particularly good private or NHS doctor/surgeon/hospital for her, within the London/Kent area? I don't know what stage the cancer is at as she is still to have a biopsy, although her current clinic has recommended chemotherapy. Thanks in advance, Fr1end01",
