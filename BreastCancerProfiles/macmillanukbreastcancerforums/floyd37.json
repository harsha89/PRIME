      "Content": "Help!  My lovely Mum has just been 'diagnosed' with Paget's Disease.  Unfortunately, she also has advanced Alzheimer's and Vascular Dementia which means a mamogram or biopsy would be too traumatic and my sister and I have had to take the awful decision that  any treatment would be  too cruel.  Has anyone had experience of breast cancer with Alzheimer's sufferers?  We cannot get any sense out of her doctor as regards a prognosis or  what is in store for my poor Mum.  She is 73 and in a care home 250 miles away.",

It is interesting that your local hospice nursed your Dad in his care home- I didn't think of that- I will look into it. Thanks again.",
