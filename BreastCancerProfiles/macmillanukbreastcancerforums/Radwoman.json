      "Content": "Hi Dreamthief, That is so helpful. I was going round in circles trying to find a reference to TPM! I was diagnosed with grade 3 invasive ductal carcinoma associated with extensive squamous differentation (metaplastic characteristics) and associated in situ carcinoma again showing squamous differentation associated with extensive tumour cell necrosis. The lesion measures approx 53mm. Thank you so making this clearer for me. XX",

      "Content": "Hi Everyone, I have been given my breast cancer pathology report today (I had a mastectomy 2 weeks ago) but I am not able to understand it. Everywhere on this site, and others, describe TNM Staging whereas mine seems to be TPM. My lymph nodes were clear and I have grade 3 invasive ductal carcinoma T3 P3 M2-3 Â with the tumour measuring 53mm. Can anyone explain this for me please? Thanks for your help.",

      "Content": "Hi helpful ladies, I was diagnosed with stage 3 BC last June, luckily with no nodal involvement, so have had mastectomy, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. All completed at end of January and now just having three-weekly Herceptin injections (due one tomorrow) until October. The cancer diagnosis came out of the blue and hit me very hard. My problem is my emotions are all over the place! I used to be a strong person, an NHS professional, but have now taken ill-health retirement and am no longer working. I feel stressed and anxious all the time. We've sold our house in Sussex and need to find somewhere to rent in Devon soon, but haven't been to look there yet. Trying to pack everything as well. It all seems too much and I can't sleep more than a few hours at night. I ended up in A/E last week and, when the tests all came back negative, it was implied I had suffered a panic attack - probably true with hindsight, but I did genuinely feel very unwell. No-one knows how panicky and alone I am feeling when I think I should be getting stronger by now. Any tips/help to calm me down and get me through this would be very much appreciated.",
