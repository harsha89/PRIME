      "Content": "Hi Chin up, things will get better. I had a dog ear which was getting very sore and spoke to the Consultant about it. I was told there isn't anything that can be done. However, 7 months after surgery,  the dog ear is reducing in size and is less sore.  As a retired nurse I was aware of the properties of Bio-oil for reducing scar tissue so have been using it regularly, just gently massage into the scar and dog ear. Worth a try to save further surgery ? As for exercises, we are fortunate to have a gym in Harrogate that offers the 12 week Pink Ribbon exercise programme based on Pilates. At the beginning I only had 50% movement in my arm and shoulder, after completing the course I have a full range of movement and almost the same strength as before surgery. Take one day at a time and you will get there. L",

      "Content": "Thank you all for your kind words of support. With the agreement of my family I am thinking the way to go is quality of life not quantity. My mother had breast cancer (different type to mine) and refused surgery but agreed to Tamoxifen. She survived for nearly ten years and it was dementia that claimed her not the breast cancer. Will discuss with the Consultant on Wednesday and see what he says. Once again many thanks for your repliesand words of support. Bothered",

      "Content": "Hi everyone I hope someone out there has some words of wisdom for me. How quickly are the side effects of medication reversed? I have been taking Arimidex for 9 months, changed to Exemestane 1 month ago because of side effects. I forgot to take it for 2 days and can not believe how much better I felt. Joint pains all gone, slept well and woke refreshed, full of energy and enthusiasm for life. Managed to garden all day today without becoming exhausted. My husband also tells me I am in not as moody - always a bonus. Due in clinic on Wed so will discuss with Consultant but just wanted to get some idea of the stance I should take.",

      "Content": "Hi. I stopped taking anastrozole after 1 year as I couldn't cope with the joint pains, headaches, fatigue and lethargy. I had a huge row with the Consultant about not taking the tablets. Went back to see the Oncologist to discuss it. Found out that the tablets reduced the risk of a return by 0.3 % His answer to me when I said I didn't want to take the tablets \"well don't then\", he was a bit funny at first but then seemed to understand my reluctance to take anything including Tamoxifen as my family has a history of DVT and PE. I have now been tablet free for 6 months and the majority of my symptoms have settled.  I already had arthritis in my knees, back and hips so that will never improve any more than it is. I was not able to have chemotherapy as I was discovered to have a heart murmur. Lots of  things seemed to go wrong at the same time with me. I have now decided to live each day as it comes and if I want to do something I will regardless of how mad it may be. Wanting to do a sky dive now. Hope you are soon feeling better and everything goes ok with your further treatments.",

I only had a small range of movement in my arm shoulder and back after a mastectomy, LD reconstruction and sentinel lymph node removal in June last year. After doing the course I have full range of movement and feel a lot better about myself. I would highly recommend it if there is one in your area. ",
