    "Content": "Oh, oh, yours is exactly the scenario I'm secretly dreading (in my less positive moments). I was diagnosed with non-invasive DCIS last month. The consultant was terribly reassuring, telling me it's very early stage and surgery will be \"curative\". But I can't feel reassured until the pathology report comes back after my op (scheduled for this Friday) and I'm convinced the d*mn thing has grown since I found it. I suppose the medics want to be reassuring because they know there's only so much frightening information one human can take at a time, and if they spelled out all the possible negative outcomes it would be overwhelming. And because they want the best for you and so hope for the best for you, otherwise they wouldn't be in the business. We have to keep hoping. I hope your mx goes as well as it can and that it gives you some peace of mind. Sending you positive vibes. \"Abby\" xxx (x) xxx",
