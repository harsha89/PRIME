      "Content": "My first appointment was for ct scan and    Getting tattoos so everything was in. Place for starting 3 weeks later. When I asked about R1 and R2 I was told that they didn't know what it was and to use diorobase  which they supply.  I'm in my 3rd week now and so far I'm ok although I just had a lumpectomy and am not in any hormones,  As straight forward as you can get although tiredness is. Now setting in as I am trying to continue to work with support. Good luck with your treatment.  ",

      "Content": "I have found that It definitely has helped me to talk, all my friends and family have been really supportive, I'm in my 4th week or radiotherapy and my emotions are up and down constantly.  I do think I will ever not Be anxious now as it is always at theback if your mind. The hardest part for me is trying to put a brace front on all the time as I don't want to worry my family or elderly parents ",

      "Content": "I too had a lumpectomy 23mm, luckily it was contained in breast duct. It's the waiting for results that is the hardest.  I just keep telling myself how lucky I am that it was caught early.  I'm now in my 3rd week of radiotherapy and it's not too bad so far, 2 more weeks to Go.  It seems for forever when you're waiting for results but it definitely helped me to keep myself busy.  Good luck with your surgery ",
