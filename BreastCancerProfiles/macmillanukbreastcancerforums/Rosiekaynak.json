    "Content": "Hi there, Firstly - sorry to hear about this and what a huge shock for you as well as getting a new job. Never rains it pours. Secondly - you have a lot of rights.  Cancer is now treated as a disability under the disability act - so you are protected and your employer has to support you, or you have a lot of rights in your favour. My work were amazing - they asked me what I wanted, and I stopped working through chemotherapy, but worked from home when i felt well enough and returned soon after my operation and carried on through radiotherapy.  Everyone is different.  I did however feel hugely relieved that I was totally supported and also if you work in a larger company - occupational health should be there to support you, as they were for me. Good luck and don't worry - the laws are there to support you.",
