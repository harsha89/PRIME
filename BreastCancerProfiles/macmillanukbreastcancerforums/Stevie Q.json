I was also wondering if anyone is taking calcium, cod liver oil or products with biotin in as a supplement? Many thanks sisters xx",

It was the physio that told me this.  I went to see her about 6 weeks after op and told her what exercise I do in an average week ....ranging from boxercise to cheerleading.  She said that I could do anything which involved my legs, I could dance and jump but that upper body exercise involving arms was out!  As was lifting.  No swimming for 14 weeks more due to infection than anything else. So now my legs are amazing (ha ha !!!) and now that I can swim I feel I am getting good all round exercise. In 5 weeks I can do anything I like!  Bring it on! I know I am going off subject now, but exercise helps so much with both physical and emotional wellbeing and being able to do some has really helped me get through this time. With loads of love, Stevie xxx",

      "Content": "Hi, There was lots of bruising and swelling after my mastectomy, but I guess that would have been there strattice or not.  The implant was initially higher than it has ended up, if that makes sense.  It all settles over time. Everything is just so personal to each and every one of us.  I wanted a mastectomy, I did not want anxiety that cancer had not all gone.  I had already had two lumps (non cancerous) in my left breast.  I also felt very strongly that I wanted a reconstruction so that helped me accept my implant.   I had my nipple removed. I think it is a situation that no-one would want to be in and we have to make the best of a bad situation - in a way that is right for us as individuals.   Love Stevie Q xx",

      "Content": "Hi there! I had node biopsy at the same time and I think that was the most uncomfortable thing! I hardly used any pain relief after my op.  For me it is the implant that feels odd at times and it takes some getting used to.  I used to sleep on my tummy, but am only just getting back to that (5 months on).  I have no issues at all with strattice and I often laugh about having a teenage breast again!   I am glad I had it done. In hospital one night had drain in for 10 days and by then had stopped draining fluid, it just fitted in with a hospital appointment I had anyway!  Driving - I was advised 4 weeks - by physio.  I took that time because my husband could drive me around as he is retired.  It took time to get used to, but no problems. My advice would be to do the exercises given to you post op.  These have really worked for me.  I have total flexibility in my arm and did quite quickly.  Keep doing them.  I feel as fit and flexible as I always have. Take care, with love Stevie xx",

      "Content": "Hi there Kenla, Just read this and it sounded so like me that I needed to respond!  I was also diagnosed in March and have completed my treatment, now on hormone tablets for 5 years.  I am older than you, 56 years, but I have four children aged between 31 and 17.   My employers have been absolutely fabulous too and I have been treated with love and respect throughout.  I have never had so many flowers,  good wishes and kind words!  I am a social worker and have worked with children and families for 34 years.  Like you I absolutely love my job and used to say to my husband that he would have to drag me out of work kicking and screaming.  I still love my job, but my priorities have completely changed.  I am old enough to retire and although I have returned to work my heart is no longer in it and last week I got the news that I have osteoporosis.  I have looked after my health forever, I love exercise and I eat so healthily, never smoked and I hardly drink alcohol.  So I am feeling a bit, fat, 'It's not fair!' at the moment.  I always planned to retire when my youngest went to Uni, but on Monday I will hand in my notice with a retirement date for the autumn and I am beyond excited! My kids have been amazing, my youngest twins took their GCSEs during my treatment and passed with flying colours, they are now at sixth form and loving it.  We have celebrated my eldest sons wedding this year and what a joyous event that was!   I have loved being at home with my children and they have been amazing!  I always wanted to be a positive role model to them, working hard and providing for them equally to their father.  I have done that and now it is my turn to chill.  Like you my relationship with my husband is strong and his kindness and compassion has been wonderful. Breast cancer has definitely made me reevaluate my life and I am thankful for that.   Follow your dreams I am sure you will have no regrets. With love and respect, Stevie Q",

I was completely shocked to have osteoporosis as I am fit and healthy and was cheerleading and falling off the top of the pyramid on a regular basis with no problems whatsoever!   I do not have any pain at all from Letrozole and I am aware that I am lucky.  I have kept to the same brand as the initial one prescribed has been just fine.   Thanks for the almond milk tip, I am currently drinking soya milk with added calcium.  I do like almond milk too so shall give that a try.  I am also trying to eat green veg and yoghurt, cheese and rice pudding.   All the best and thanks again, Stevie Q",

      "Content": "Hi all, I am taking Letrozole which I started in June 2017.  I had a bone scan in August as a baseline, but it revealed that I had osteoporosis (clearly not having a good year health wise!). After being very angry and in denial (as I feel as fit as I ever have, thankfully I am in no pain at all), I have decided that it is another thing which I just have to 'get on with' and adapt my life accordingly.  I love to exercise but will have to stop doing the strenuous exercise that I do as it includes lifting and risk of falls.  I eat pretty healthily already, I am vegetarian with a good balanced diet. So I was wondering if anyone else finds themselves in this position and has any good tips and hints for keeping pain free and helping the old bones going!  I have been prescribed calcium tablets and aldrenic acid and will have another bone scan in two years.  Many thanks and with love as always, Stevie Q",
