      "Content": "Dear Trudi just try to stay strong you WILL get through it in the end with or without your uncaring family!!I also became very bitter and twisted about certain family members (most of them I no longer bother with!)I also have lost a few so called 'friends' who now never visit or even bother to email!I have turned to the people I love and trust best ( there are not many of them,)mainly my husband and daughters.You have been through an awful lot and it is only natural to feel like this,give yourself a big pat on the back for getting this far..and keep fighting and be more selfish (like they are)By the way you are also beautiful!!!

      "Content": "Hi I am new to this great site, and wish I had joined before!I live abroad and although Im getting good care I feel very alone.I had a lumpectomy to remove a small 7mm tumour and the first lymph node removed.I had a second op.to remove more of the 'margin' before chemo.but the cells were ok !I am having my fourth cycle in the morning, and dreading it.Does anyone have advice on how to prevent nausea?I do take pills for it and one extra if it fails to place under the tongue.I try to drink a lot of water, as I'm told this helps too.I'm returning to walking and swimming and feel quite well/positive but have low day's when I feel it may not work, and I get scared.Since my third chemo my nail beds look blue/purple on and off during the day,has anyone else noticed this?Could it be a heart/oxygen problem? julie",
