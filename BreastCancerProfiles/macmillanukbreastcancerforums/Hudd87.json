      "Content": "Sounds like you have similar to me my first operation was early March,second early April. I have a seroma under my first scar which was slowly disappearing so they didn't drain it,unfortunately I got an infection in it a fortnight ago. My GP prescribed strong antibiotics and I have been and had it drained so I am on the mend waiting to start radiotherapy. This is not a horror story in fact the opposite I was treated quickly, just wanted to say keep an eye on your lump and don't hesitate to go to your GP if needed.Hope all goes well x",

      "Content": "Hi Marine 20,Â I first spoke to my BCN and she suggested the GP so maybe give your nurse a call.Mine has almost cleared up now,and it has been a good excuse to sit in the garden enjoy the sunshine and get the family to make the tea. Don't worry about it I am guessing that infections are not that uncommon it is something that is not always talked about. Keep smiling all the best.",
