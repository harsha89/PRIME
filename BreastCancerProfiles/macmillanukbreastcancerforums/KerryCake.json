      "Content": "Hi limbo1977, sorry your here for a while, it can be a bumpy rollercoaster ride, but you will reach the end eventually. Lots of us lovely ladies and gents on here, to soothe the ride.  It's very hard to hear the confirmation of cancer. My consultant leant in, with an odd look on his face and I just knew what was going to come out of his mouth. I was told straight away, at the biopsy stage and it was almost a relief to have it confirmed the following week, and then  some form of treatment plan to focus on. It gave me some hope, to be honest.  I had to tell my two children and I found it easiest to be straight, but gentle. I used the word cancer, I told them not to google,and if they did, to only google what I'd told them as all cancers can be different. I promised not to keep secrets, so no whispering in the kitchen, and I kept it together. I was dreading it, more than anything, but my kids were and are amazing. There was the odd question, will you die? and that was hard. I just said 'I'm not planning on it, anytime soon, so you'll still have to tidy your room' and we laughed... The most important thing, for you, is that you are able to share how you feel with someone close. Hopefully your husband will be strong for you, because you need him to be. When I felt panicky my poor husband was like 'breathe, breathe' and I said ' I can't breathe, I need to get it out' and I cried for ages and he just hugged me, and that was enough. It helped to get it out, and it's a new level of upset. But you will move past it, too, in time. If you need to cry or panic or curse and swear don't try to keep it in. I'm not saying cancer is an excuse for us to rant and rave at everyone, but your emotions are all over the place and you'll be scared of the future, and what it entails.  I found a good sob in a nice hot shower really helped.  Your right at the start of all this, we're all going through it, even those of us who have finished active treatment, there's still stuff to deal with. The truth is, you get better at it all, you get stronger and you will suprise yourself. Right now, I know exactly how you feel, because I've been there, as we all have on here. We're testament to that strength. Whatever comes you'll cope, even when you feel like your not. In the meantime excercise, go for dinner, have a lovely piece of cake, do some nice things for you, go for a walk with your husband, in the sunshine. Watch some comedy with the kids, you might not feel like laughing, but it certainly helps. My 11 year son loves impractical jokers, so we watched a lot of them, and had a few good hugs, too.  Nothing you do will make it grow faster, so eat and drink, breathe and don't blame yourself, because it's nothing that you did.  Love Kerry xx",

      "Content": "Dear Jackiruss, I never had chemo, so can't add anything to the superb replies you've already had.  I think you've been lovingly told off, for not putting yourself first. It's very hard to become a taker, when your used to being a doer or a giver, isn't it? This is one very useful lesson in all this cancer bullocks. A lot of us ladies find/ found it hard to ask for help. To be at the mercy of this horrible disease, to be looked on with pity,or to be ignored. It sucks!!! Especially if your an independent person. It seems so weak to ask for help but it's not, it's the strong thing to do. Take your sick leave from work, give yourself time to recover after your treatment. Work will still be there when this is over, waiting for you  I went back to work for a week, after my lumpectomy and then realised it was too soon. I thought I could jut carry on as before. Haha what was I thinking! Heck, During my radiotherapy I didn't go into work once, because I felt to tired and mentally drained. I teach and found I couldn't cope with a lot of students. Chemo is a whole different level of side effects.  You could think about what help you need and then enlist your family and friends, give them some tasks.  My son was 10 when I told him and he coped admirably.  We had a lot of honest chats about what it all meant. He was fascinated that I'd have a blue boob! He was also very interested/ concerned about the hormone therapy and asked a lot of questions about that. He came to appointments with me and the nurses where so kind to him. It helped him see it all as 'normal'. I also told him if I felt ill or needed cheering up. It gave him something to do for me.  Stop worrying about everyone else, and put yourself first. Take everyday as it comes and when you're having a bad day let other care for you, you have cared for them, now it's your turn. Equally, when your having a good day, (which you will), do something that makes you happy❤️ Whatever that may be.  These are the things that get you through. Remember, whatever is happening now, it's only temporary. It will stop at some point. This site is testimony to that, there's life after cancer, and it can be good. You've just got to get through the crappy bits first.  Take very good care of yourself Love and hugs  Kerry xxxxx",

      "Content": "You've had some wonderful replies, Jemima, so I can't really add much. I would say this though.  I didn't do 'poo' until I had a baby, and then I surprised myself! I also worried about people seeing me naked giving birth, well, that wasn't a problem either The fear of the Unknown can be much worse than the actuality.  You love your mum very much and if and when the time comes, for vomit to be dealt with, you'll just deal with it. I think your fear of the unknown is making you worry but you will be okay darling.  Does your hospital have a Macmillan centre? You can talk to people there, they do meditation classes and stuff to help. You've got a lot on your shoulders so make sure it's not too much for you.  Would your mum be open to joining this forum? It might help her, if she has worries. None of us want to say everything we think, to our loved ones. Sometimes it's just too dark. But it does help to get it out and on here we totally get it.  If your mums being asked to decide on chemo before or after, I'd want to know more about the pros and cons and what the doctors think. It's a big decision to make when your stressed and anxious. Ask for more clear guidance from them.  Once the ball starts rolling you'll gain more confidence and not feel so scared.  In the meantime lots of love  Big hug Kerry xxxxxx",

      "Content": "Hi Skye, that's not very good, but at least you know where you stand now, and you seem to be making your plan and sorting out the right things for you and your little darling.  I'm so glad you've got great friends and you'll be amazed at what they'll do for you.  I will tell you, after reading your thread, my friend text me for a 'catch up'. It made me feel really cross that we should need that, if she bothered a bit more she would know what was going on. So today I text her back and politely but firmly told her this, that I needed people who can and not people who can't. I explained how sore and tired I felt and how stressed I'd been at nearly losing my job to redundancy. I said I needed to focus on the three weeks I had left and that we could talk after that.  Guess what... It's her who is hurt and upset ,that I've text her unkind and upsetting things. I've got no right to say I won't speak to her, she's not rejected me, but I've rejected her and so on and so on, she bombarded me by text, all morning and into the afternoon. She came and banged on the door and me and my son were hiding lol!! OMG! I did ask why it was all about her hurt feelings and suggested that if she reflected on what I'd initially said she might get it, but it's all about her. How I obviously think she's an unsupportive friend etc etc etc me me me me blah blah blah  At no point did she say anything compassionate, like oh no I'm so sorry, I didn't realise, what can I do.   It was exhausting, I nearly had a real panic attack. I only replied twice and didn't get into it.  I'm sure I'll get a visit tomorrow, but you know, I'm DONE!  Having cancer has made me want to simplify and detoxify my life. I don't want fair weather friends and fake drama. I want to run, eat well, spend time with people who love me and whom I love,also. who have real time for me ( and me them) I want to be happy  I call cancer the unwanted gift. You learn a hell of a lot about yourself and about what you want from life and the people who you choose to share that precious life with.  My friend has no idea of the strength that lies in me. Being told you have cancer, facing your possible mortality, telling your children....these are the things that change and drive me. If I'm to make sense of it then I have to use all the shit it throws up, to make my life better for whatever time I'm here. You, Skye, do what is right for YOU. Be with lovely people and spend quality time with your daughter and the people you love, that love you unconditionally.  Because that's all that really matters in this life.  Your family will find their way, but don't waste any time worrying about their  junk.  I wish all the very best for you and your daughter Lots of love and really big hug.  Kerry xxxxxxx Ps I must add, even though it was very difficult, I feel proud of myself for having the guts to finally say it X ",

Try not to dwell on them, unfortunately they've let you down before and I would imagine you hoped that cancer might wake them up a bit, because having a baby certainly didn't! When I read stuff like this I wish we could do more, if I lived near you I would babysit! Please don't let all this spoil the fact that you are on your last chemo!! You've made it through this far, just that one more to go! Remember!! Focus on people who can and will, not people who can't and won't!!

      "Content": "Hi Pipsters, I found a lump, but dismissed it as a 'period, hormonal lump'. I could feel it, not like hard or obvious, but more 'lumpy', if that makes sense. I thought a breast lump was hard, like a pea. I didn't go to the doctors for ages, it seemed to come and go. However a bad knee forced me there, and I said ' oh, could you check this lump'.... I would just get it checked out asap. It's possibly nothing, most lumps aren't anything sinister, but if you don't you'll be doing what I did. Ignoring it, but feeling around for it in the shower, hoping it had gone, but still feeling it. Then worrying. When I think that this time last year, I knew I had a lump, but I did not go to my doctor until April Whatever it is, the sooner it's looked at the sooner you can move forward in whatever way.  Don't be afraid of what you might hear, just get it checked out if it's nothing you can forget we met! If it's something, then there are plenty of us here, to help you through. Love Kerry xx",

You can't pick your family but you CAN pick your friends! I just find cancer to be a real 'sorter out' of the people who can and the people who can't, (or won't).  My family live 300 miles away, but message me and my mum and sister have been down to visit.  I barely hear from my 'best friend'. When I told her I had cancer she ignored me for 10 days before she text me. I spent ages being upset about it, I just thought I can't do this, I felt annoyed she'd put me in this position, where we'd have to have a confrontation about it. She doesn't ever ever text to see how I am, what appointments I've had how I feel or anything. Every so often she pops in for 10 mins, doing her guilt call. In my head I've cut her loose and won't be wasting anymore time on that. I accept she can't deal with it, but I don't want to have to deal with her not dealing with it. I've had enough on my plate already!  Skye, it's hard because it's maybe not what we are used to, asserting ourselves and saying what we need, but cancer changes us. You have to lay it down to them, kindly but firmly, what you need. Make a list if nessesary, maybe pinpoint areas where different people could give you support. There are some good leaflets about coping with cancer, for families of those affected. They might help.  People can be so blind. They wait for you to ask. Are you close to your sister? Could you perhaps meet her before the big meeting, and get her oneside a bit more.  At the end of the day you have to think about you and your own family. Rally your friends, I've had help from the most obscure people!! I would imagine that you have friends who want to ease the burden on you. Just tell them what you need. I would also, if you haven't already, talk to your nurse/ chemo nurse or BC nurses. Let them know what's happening and if there's any support they could suggest.  I wonder how your family would feel, reading these replies to your post. I'd be pretty ashamed, if it was me.  Anyway, just a massive hug to you and lots of love  Kerry xxxxxxx There's so much more to cope with having cancer, it's not just the disease but all the other sh*t that goes with it ( scuse my French!) ",

Your mum will have a hormone therapy, I have tamoxifen, usually for ten years now. This is because the cancer cells like estrogen a bit too much! The hormone therapies block the estrogen, cutting off the supply. Estrogen is measured in the lab on a scale. 8 is the highest score you can get, but is a good thing. The higher the number the more response from the hormone therapy. HER- means no herceptin receptors, so that treatment would not be needed. I can't answer the others off the top of my head, without looking it up. I'm just on my way out, but felt I could at least answer some of your questions. I'm sure the other chaps will appear and give you more info.  Hope your mum's okay, take care Kerry xx",

Lovely A few days after it started to 'peel' and my scar looks pale pink again. Much much better than before.  I used the R1/2 gel and cream, or R2D2 lol! It was excellent. Even the nurses said my skin did well, they were a bit wary of it at first. I am still using it couple of times a day, my doc gave me quite a lot. I also found udder cream with urea helped, I bought that online. I use both, the R2 first, then a good old slather of Udderly smooth. Your nipple can get a bit done in, mine was like an old prune The udder cream really helped. Urea is an ingredient for cracked skin so worth trying, but after treatment has finished.  You'll be okay, get a prescription from your doctor. I felt anxious and out of control when I started rads and then it became 'normal'. I had some teary days, when I hated having to go, but everyone was so kind, plus the odd diazepam helped! It's normal for your boob to get a bit swollen, that too will all calm down once it's over.  Don't worry  Sending you a huge hug Kerry xxxxxx",

I'm presuming your mum has had a mammogram, scan and a biopsy. Has she had the results back from that yet? This will give you all more information on her type of cancer and what treatment plan might be recommended. There are various factors with a cancer diagnosis that can dictate the course of treatment.  My cancer was eostrogen and progesterone positive. That is what fed my cancer cells so I take a daily tablet to block these hormones.   Your mum might need a lumpectomy or a mastectomy. They will check her lymph nodes for cells and then she might have chemo or radiotherapy or both. She might have hormone manipulation or herceptin or both. There's different variations depending on the biopsy and node results. Please don't be scared by this list. The doctors have what's called a multi disciplinary meeting, involving all the relevant experts. Oncology,radiology, the surgeon etc. They all have a voice and decide what will be the best plan and nothing gets missed. I had a meeting afterwards with my consultant. He went through what had been discussed, what was recommended and why. I could ask questions or query anything and decide if I was happy with it and I then signed a consent form for treatment.  Honestly, you will both feel a million times better when you have the treatment plan. It's what you can focus on and is the way forward. Once the ball stars rolling things it's a lot better.  Your mum will be assigned a Breast cancer nurse. Mine was great and very helpful, you can ring her with questions or concerns.  If your mums just found out then she'll be reeling with it all. You go through a huge range of emotions, I mainly felt terrified and numb, with a lot of fear and disbelief thrown in. It takes time to process such lifechanging information.  Can you tell us a bit more about your mum's diagnosis so far, if that ok. It would help to know were she is with it all.  I think you are obviously a very caring loving daughter, you are here, looking for advice on how to cope and help your mum and my heart goes out to you. As a mum myself I tried to be honest about my diagnosis but hid my tears and worry from my children.  Talking helps and being allowed to cry or say your deepest, darkest fears. I can't speak for everyone but I'd say a huge number of us think ' am I going to die'. It's natural. Your mum is probably worrying about you, too, and might try not to worry you too much.  Cancer is a very scary word, but lots of people survive it and treatments have come a long way, with new drugs being researched all the time.  Jemilyxx, you're on this journey with your mum now and you'll both discover hidden strength and depths that you never knew you had. It will greatly help your mum, knowing she's not alone. Sending you both a huge cyber hug and much love and positive thoughts Kerry xxx",

      "Content": "Hi Jemilyxx I'm so glad that has helped. I'm not very good with the statistics of it all, but I saw your other post in ask the nurse bit and I think she's done a fabulous job of giving you all the information on grading and survival rates etc. If you have a wobble just focus on what she has told you!  If your mum has been told her cancer is hormone receptive that's good ( in the weird world of 'cancer' good)  I am 48 so I'm on tamoxifen at the moment. At a later date they will change me to letrozole. I will take it for 10+ years and it will suppress the eostrogen that my cancer cells were enjoying a bit too much! My lump was small, so I had a lumpectomy (WLE) and they did a sentinel node biopsy (SNB) I will say, after the operation I felt a bit dizzy ( morphine) but not in pain. I had the op at 915am and went home at 4pm,   I managed on a cocodomal type painkiller they gave me, for a few days.  If your mum has a mastectomy ( mx) then she would probably stay in overnight and also have drain for a while.  When I took my dressing off the scar looked horrendous, like someone had bundled a load of skin up and stitched it. I cried all evening, my surgeon had promised me it would look wonderful. He seemed very proud he was giving me this 'wonderful scar' where as I was like ' knife and fork is fine, just cut it out!'. I joked I was getting a Chanel logo When it came down to it I was shocked by how much I actually cared. Anyway, when the dust settled It became a 'wonderful scar'. Everything heals and swelling goes down.    I had to wait two weeks for the results of my SNB. After the first week of healing I had the nervous terrors a bit, waiting for more test results. That can be a hard time, but you get through it.  I would encourage you both to cultivate some black humour. It can really help! My sister referred to my cancer as 'cells on crack' which made us both giggle !!  Don't be afraid to say the word 'cancer' out loud. It's not like 'he who must not be named'. Quite the opposite, in fact. Saying 'cancer' out loud can take the power away from the word. It can help you accept what has come into your life and help you focus your energy on more positive things.  It can often be very tiring telling people, as they all break down and you find your constantly comforting people. You could set up a private family and friends Facebook group, so you can inform everyone of what's happening and how your mum is  all in one message. It gets wearing, texting the same thing over and over, and they can all support each other, too. Make sure you both do some lovely mum and daughter stuff, maybe have a pedicure or a facial,shopping trip with a nice cake!  Don't scary Google! Go to reputable websites for information.  Watch comedy!! Not Eastenders lol. I rewatched the whole set of Ab Fab and some other silly stuff. It really does help. There is a wealth of advice and experience on here, mine is but one voice in a sea of voices.  No question is too daft and no rant will go unheard.  Just put one foot in front of the other and remember to breathe! And you will be amazed at the kindness and love you and your mum will receive. Accept all offers of help, people want to do something and it can take the pressure of you. Your only young and you can't carry it all yourself, so please make sure to look after yourself, too. Much love to you both  Kerry xx",

It's the future!  I used to get the nagging feeling, in bed at night, that there was me, my husband and my lump. So we christened it 'Camilla, there are three of us in this marriage', which my daughter loved, and still now refers to it as Camilla's demise.  There are terribly scary times on this journey, but it's not all like that. I've had wonderful support from some great people, I only told people who needed to know. Last week I ran my first 10k, inspired by my cancer journey to get fit again. It was only after that that I told all my other friends, via Facebook with pictures of the race. The amount of positive messages and love was overwhelming, people shared their stories of their journey. Cancer touches so many people.   We have to try to get through it, the best we can, and find something within ourselves to make all the pain and heartache worth the journey. Whatever the outcome  Treatment has moved on so much.  It's beautiful weather, try to get out in the sun and enjoy some 'you' time. Have a pedicure or a treat.  As women, we find it all too hard to look after ourselves and spoil ourselves, usually sorting everybody else out!  Love Kerry xxxx",

Having started to get a rash myself, I had a Google, wrote down the details and the pip numbers and today my lovely doctor has written me a prescription for these two items. Gel and lotion. Result!! Is says you can start to use them before your treatment, to build up the skin.  The small pharmacy could only get the R1, but Boots has ordered them both for me and they should be here by weds morning. They're a special item, so need to be ordered in advance. Normally 3-5 days, but as I've already started my rads they've put a rush on for me.  I would most definitely see your doctor. I spoke to my radiotherapist and she said it was good and to use it if possible. I told my doctor she'd recommended them. Take the info, because mine hadn't heard of them, though they popped up on her computer when she typed in the details.   She has given me a 6 weeks supply! Bless her. Let us know how you get on Kerry xxx ",

I'm taking my aspirin like a good little Guinea pig and so far so good lol! I wish I'd got this stuff earlier, I did use the gel last night and I'm going to use it today as well, to catch up a bit! Yesterday my boob felt frazzled for the first time. Today it looks so much better. I put three sachets of the lotion on, over a 4 hour period, because it felt so dry. Again it's really helped.  I'm going to give the nurse a sample, but I'm not going to disclose my methods! I have the greatest respect for my rads nurse, they are fab and I get that they are truly looking out for me and are naturally cautious.  I'll send you a friend request and we can keep tabs on our success ( hopefully)  Where are you up to?  Love  Kerry xxx",

She said she'd never heard of it but got the name and went and googled it. It's the talk of LA7! So today I had my treatment as usual, my skins getting the tan lines now, they asked me to wait to talk to the rads nurse. She then spent some time telling me that they'd actually called the company in Germany, she was very very cautious about me using it, stating they didn't recognise it at whatever the governing body of radiologists is called. She was trying be helpful. I said I'd be careful but that regardless, there was people on here that had used it successfully and that I would take on board what she said, but that also the real experiences of the ladies who'd used already were important to note.  She's asked if I'd take some in to let them have a look, on Monday.  Anyway, regardless, I spent a very happy 30 mins, boob out slathered in R1.  Was lovely and soaked in well and cooled my skin. I'm now happily coated in R2 and my skin feels ok.  I've actually felt dry all day, face etc. Drank loads of water, maybe this is phase 2 , the dryness, I feel like an old prune! Anyway, it will be interesting to see how it works and I'll keep you updated.  Hugs  Kerry xxx",

I would be of the mind to either ask for another doctor if possible, some are definitely more sympathetic than others, and secondly, I would remind him/her that you've had cancer and that actually, you deserve any old damn thing you feel will help you!!  There are weekly packs available and 6 weekly packs. The larger packs have 30 R1 sachets and 168 R2 sachets, split into three little boxes inside the big box. That's the one you need.  I would also say, if it helps, that your radiotherapist has recommended you get it. Yes, it might be a lie, but hey ho, whatever!  I have udder cream, don't use that, use the R1/2. You can use the udder cream on your legs and arms etc  My R1/2 came with clear instructions but if your not sure what to do give us a shout on here. Start using it as soon as you've had your first treatment, it would be good to use it for a week before but I'm not sure of the quantity you have or have access too.   It seems to me that the more of us ladies start using this then the more evidence there will be, maybe they should have a trial It's not always easy to get what we want, you have to fight a bit, so don't be put off!!  Best of luck  Big hug Kerry xxx",

      "Content": "Hi all, several years ago I bought and read a book called the China Study. has anyone else heard of it? It makes for interesting reading. It talks a lot about the link between dairy proteins and BC, in a study they did and also the difficulty in passing the findings over to the relevant people. It's American, so all the big organisations, the governing bodies, for milk, meat production etc managed to lobby congress, to stop this info getting out. Anyway, it scared the bejesus out of me, I nearly turned vegetarian. Anyhow, I did change to soy/almond milk and cut right back on dairy. I still got BC but I feel it was probably there already, DCIS. Anyway I only buy organic milk now, can't force my stuff on the family, unfortunately, but my daughter has followed my lead. We have vegetarian nights and meat/fish nights. I try to balance it out. I hate quorn so don't buy that. I try to buy organic meat were possible, to calm my food fears. Funny how I used to never think about this but now it's hard to not have the nagging voice. I've found buying less food but better quality has helped. My husband could do to lose a few pounds We can only try our best and do what sits right for us. Personally I'm sick of reading about all the things that are going to give me cancer. The Daily Mail is the worst for doom and gloom.  Love  Kerry xxxx",

It always pains me to see how many new members are joining, but it\u2019s comforting to know that the forum is here and that support is amazing. If your joining the club then this is the place to be   its been ages since I\u2019ve posted. My sister has been diagnosed with ovarian cancer and anal cancer. She had a 30cm mass removed from her abdomen and her ovaries also. They have said they have got it all and that they can treat the anal cancer with chemo, surgery etc. My oncologist has now  said that I should be genetically tested as there can be a link between breast and ovarian cancer.  Has anyone on here any experience of this and what it entails? I must admit I\u2019m a bit scared and it\u2019s all a bit much at the moment. Cancer seems to have re entered my life again, after a period of calm, through two of my family and a close friend.  I posted this on the ovarian cancer page as well, just hoping for some insights. When I was originally diagnosed I asked about genetic testing as I have a daughter and they didn\u2019t seem too concerned.  All my old fears and worries have come back to the surface. I\u2019ve been \u2018coping\u2019 for such a long time and now I feel like that\u2019s been shattered.  Any info is greatly appreciated  thanks Kerry x Sometimes only bunnies can get you through ️",

I've lost peopel very close to me and I think nowadays many many people have had to experience cancer for themselves or through a loved one. It brings all manner of things up and we all cope in different ways. My opinion of cancer, dealing with it and how I approached treatment was based on me and my knowledge of what I could cope with. Obviously I listened to my doctors, but I also did a lot of reading up and learnt as much as I could about my very detailed Pathology report. . Scary stuff, but it helped me deal with it and make better informed choices. Because at the end of the day, that's what it boils down to. We have a choice, we choose and then we cope with, deal with and live with our decisions...whether the conventional way or the nonconventional way. A number of people opt out of chemo or rads or the hormone therapies. That is what they can personally reconcile with. We are all different.  I respect you all, ladies, you are all survivors, just in your own way.  Now can everyone calm down and stroke the bunnies  peace and love to EVERYONE❤️❤️❤️",

We all have had to deal with our cancers, why is there so much aggression and angst over who does what? The thing that connects us seems to be tearing some of us up! I can't remember seeing this before.  Please can you all just spend 5 minutes looking at my lovely bunnies. ( OK, so I'm a saddo )They make me feel better everyday, and are so happy And loving.  Please ladies, this is gone past debate. ive found so much warmth and support on this forum and I feel quite upset reading some of these posts. Where is our compassion for each other..... Be gentle, we've all got scars ❤️❤️",

I'm not really too familiar with metaplastic BC and a quick Google tells me that it's rare, 1%!  You must feel very alone but you are in the best place for support. Firstly I would suggest starting a seperate thread, as you might  just get lost in this one. if you haven't already, join the triple negative group. There will be lots of info and support there. Is your appointment on weds to discuss treatment options? It is very frightening, waiting for test results, fearing the worse. Our minds can go down very deep dark holes, if we let them. I felt like I was out of control. I think though, when I got a treatment plan I could deal with everything much better. It was scary, but I felt better, I knew what would happen and when and I could make a few plans. What time is your appointment? Try to take someone, it can be for support or to remeber the bits you forget. There's such a lot to take in, it's easy to miss bits so make notes if you need to and ask as many questions as you feel you must. I made a little list. I found it helped because my brain was like a Swiss cheese in the early days.  Post on here if your worried, or just need to let off steam. There is usually someone awake to give you a cyber hug. And please let us know how you get on . Heres a big cyber hug from me ((((((((HUG))))))))) and sending you love  Kerry xxxx",

I started running just before I started rads, and ran everyday through treatment, in the summer, usually straight from the hospital. I didn't want to get fatigue and had read that exercise could help minimise it, so went for it!  I was only doing a mile or so to start with, running and walking. I hadn't run for about 10 years! Anyway, it helped me deal with everything so much that I can now say that I am a runner, and proud! I run 3 times a week and last month did my first 10k, a feat I'd have never dreamt of a year ago. If you feel like running, and you can, I'd just go for it. As long as it is not hurting you or making you feel any worse then try. Be gentle, though. Chemo is rough on some, but running might  help you through it. I'm much tougher, mentally, for all of this. Good luck and keep us posted  Love Kerry xx",

I'd just signed a permanent contract. Luckily my boss was, and is,brilliant. Several ladies at my company had in the past had breast cancer, so I felt very supported and they had an idea of what they were dealing with, for time off sick etc. I chose to only tell my boss and the HR manager at first. I was in a bit of a state and I just needed somewhere I could go where no one knew and I could do my job and pretend it was all ' business as usual'. My boss helped me and then, when I was ready, she told all my colleagues for me, so I didn't have to go through that. Everyone was incredibly kind, texting me and visiting. I was stunned, really.  So many people know someone who's been affected by cancer nowadays and I found a lot of support from unexpected places.  Your right at the start of it all and there's a lot to take in and a lot to come. Just take it slowly and don't feel you have to put on a brave face. It's very scary, being told you have cancer. We've all been in that boat and it's not a fun time. You'll find lots of information and support on here, so post anything you need to. No question is too daft, no rant will go unheard.  Love Kerry xx",

      "Content": "Hi Jane, I had what my surgeon described as a ' subcapsulation of cells' in my sentinel lymph node.This sounds the same as what your talking about. He explained that this is classed as a negative result. This is because it is smaller than 2mm. Mine was 0.2 mm, it might show this on your path report with a < sign, meaning smaller. He also said that it is more than likely due to the position of my lump, right upper quadrant, sitting right on the tail so very close to the lymph, rather than the cancer invading the node.  At the time it didn't really register, but later on I got myself in a right old tizz, imagining cancer cells floating around everywhere and worrying I should've had chemo. I went in for my radiotherapy appointment and had a bit of crying meltdown. The radiographer came, got my report and went through it in great detail, which really helped and reassured me. If your feeling anxious or unsure please talk to someone on your team, your BC nurse, your consultant, and don't be shooed in and out in a rush. It's important to be clear about what things mean and you don't always take it in on the day!  I have to say I really wanted my report but reading it without the full explanations was a bit of a minefield, then Dr Google gets in on the act and that's a recipe for disaster I would trust your surgeon. That is what I decided to do. He said clear margins, that's good. He said clear nodes, that's good. There are no guarantees for any of us, cancer or no cancer. We just have to find the good bits and run with them.  Hope this helps Love Kerry xxxx",

I didn't need it in the end as my lymph was 'clear'. I had a microcapsulation of cells in my SLN, but smaller than 1mm, 0.2mm, so that's classed as clear. As they'd removed it they said no chemo and no node rads. (I did have a breast boost, to the tumour site, 10 extra rads on top of the 15)  Do you have a number for your BC nurse? You could call her and explain what it is your worried about. Mine acted like a go between. I'd ring her, she'd speak to the consultant and call me back, or get the onco secretary to call.  If they recommend rads then they must have a clear reason, or it could be precautionary. I think they need to be helping you out a bit more.  my sister is a nurse. She always told me to ask the doctor ' if I was your sister/mum/gran what would you advice be?' It can help you make your decision.  Good luck and hugs Kerry xxx",

It can be different manufactures use slightly different ingredients, alongside the tamoxifen, and this seems to give different reactions in different people. My doctors surgery said they could only give me whatever they got in, but Boots orders Teva for me. I take Teva brand tamoxifen and have been okay, so far, fingers crossed.  My friend takes a 20mg dose in two 10mg tablets and strangely her flushes became nothing, same brand also.  I'm sure you'll get lots of helpful replies. I know a lot of the ladies have medicine from the doctor, to help. Sadly I feel all cancer treatments involve a trade off. Side effects vs possible recurrence.  Love  Kerry xx",

      "Content": "OHi Worried,  I'm also taking tamoxifen, since July 2016. It was very hot and I seemed to be very hot a lot, plus not using deodorant during rads didn't help! You ever tried drying your hair and it just keeps getting wet again, from the heat lovely!  Anyway, it did all settle down. You might've read that different generic brands can suit you better than others, so,if you are feeling okay on the brand your on, make sure that is what your pharmacist orders for you.  I have Teva. That suits me. Boots gets me this brand every two months.  I was not menopausal when I was diagnosed. My oncologist said to let her know when I'd not had a period for 18-24 months. As I'm a tad scared of switching to an aromatase, the longer I'm on tamoxifen the better, in my mind. I do dread getting joint pain and flushes. Only 'side effect' I've really noticed us my hair has got a lot thinner. It's possible this is a side effect of shock/ treatment. Things like that can cause stress hairloss and take 6months plus to show up.  I think the most important thing is to try not to worry or look for side effects. I've got friends on tamoxifen who have no problems at all. Millions of women take it but not everyone gets all the SE's listed.  I also started walking, then jogging, then running. Scared of putting peri menopausal weight on! I do yoga too, highly recommend it, not as easy as you think, but do good for calming your brain down. Beats therapy for me. It IS my therapy! Excersise is a great panacea, and gave me a chance to get out the house and rant, cry and talk myself back to sanity. Thank goodness for large dark sunglasses. Throuout my own cancer rollercoaster ride  I've been shocked, scared, sick, terrified, angry, helpless .......cried more tears than I thought possible. I've also been happy, thankful, humbled, amazed, grateful, determined, optimistic and alive.  And I discovered how strong I could be, in the worst times. I saw my consultant on Monday, he said 'how are you, anything your worried about?'  I said ' only the things that people who've had cancer worry about' Whenever something seems difficult, I just think about last year and I know I'll be able to cope. Because cancer showed me I could. You won't always be 'WORRIED'. You'll become yourself again, in time. A slightly different you, but still you Love Kerry xx",

      "Content": "Hi Acidomoduso saw your post, sorry your mum's joined our club, but welcome, you won't regret joining and we'll help you through. Grade 3 is how the cells look under the microscope, so not ness an indication of how fast they've grown. The staging is normally down to whether the lymphs are involved and how many. If lymphs are involved then chemo is pretty likely. No indication of vascular invasion is good, it means they have not detected cancer cells breaking into the blood stream.  I had estrogen receptor cancer and have been taking tamoxifen for nearly a year now. Your mum will have a hormone therapy, usually anastrazole or letrozole. It's important to monitor the bone density because these drugs can make the bones weaker, or less dense, giving more risk of osteoporosis. She'd probably be offered a regular injection to strengthen her bones, alongside the hormone treatment. I have tamoxifen because I'm pre menopausal. When that changes I'll have one of the others.  some ladies have side effects, like flushes and achey joints on these drugs. If this happens to your mum please come on here and post. There's tons of useful information that can help her, if needed. But don't worry unless it happens.  It's good she's having further scans. If there is anything to be found then they will find it, if there's nothing, then that puts everyone's mind at rest. The main thing is she's already started the process of getting treatment.  It's a very anxious time at the beginning and it can be very stressful and upsetting. But once you get the plan going it's much better, you have a focus, you can do things for your mum.  You might live 5 hours away but you can still help her find bras, share tips from here from the chemo club etc. There's a lot you can do via the Internet. Texting her regularly, just saying hello I love you, thinking about you, or whatever is a massive help. It was lovely getting texts from my family and friends, sometimes I wasn't upto a full blown conversation and a text was something I could look at and it made me feel better. Some people sent me funny jokes and stuff and that was good too.  The worst thing I found was that some people who I thought could cope with it really didn't. It became about them. I had to cut a good friend loose and we still don't talk. But I'm at peace with that decision and have some great people in my life now.  Also, being on the other side is still scary. We learn to be strong through treatment, but sometimes when it's over that's when we fall apart. Everyone sees the strong woman kicking cancer's butt, but it's not the whole picture. Your mum needs support throughout treatment, but in particular, after treatment is crucial.  I think, 'you can see my physical scars, but you can't see the mental ones'.  Your mum, being your mum, will not want you to worry too much, so will likely hide stuff so you don't stress. The mother instinct is always there. I had an open discussion with my then 11 and 14 year old children and I promised to be open and honest with them, and let them know what was happening. Perhaps you could have a chat with your mum and reassure her that you want to be kept completely in the loop, with info on her treatment and stuff around it.  Your mum's not going to be herself for a while. I felt being told I had cancer was like a death. It was the death of the old me, my old life and my old thoughts. You grieve for these things because you can never get them back. Grieving takes whatever time it takes and we're all different. It's difficult. But I can say I am very happy in my life at the moment and I do appreciate so much more than I ever did before. You do get your life back, it's just packaged differently and you never lose the fear. You just learn to live with it. I have a good sense of humour and that helps. Have a laugh, it's not all doom and gloom. No one is dead until they are!  Cancer is hard on everyone, but we get through, with the help of our friends, the love of our family and by sheer determination to not let it beat us.  Love Kerry xxx",

      "Content": "Hi Cocopops, I found my lump in November last year and didn't go to the doctors. It seemed to come and go so I convinced myself it was period related. When I finally got it looked at, in April, I'd actually gone to the doctors about my KNEES!  It was always there, nagging away, but I suppose I was in denial.  It's actually the first time I've admitted this timeframe to myself, let alone anyone else I silently beat myself up no end. I can't really take away your feelings, I felt so guilty and couldn't believe that I'd ' been so stupid' ( my words at me, not you) Once I was diagnosed I couldn't eat for fear of the lump having a growth spurt, that's not a realistic scenario but everything feels terrifying whilst your waiting for results.  But you know what? The main thing you have to focus on is that you HAVE had it looked at. Your in the system now and you will have your tests, get your results and have a treatment plan.  I replaced the word 'stupid' with 'scared'. I was scared, that's why I didn't go to the docs. I think many of us can relate to that.  It's such early days for you, Cocopops. We've all been there and totally get how you feel. Believe me when I say that you'll get through this. The initial fear/terror/panic calms down a bit. You will feel more in control when you have your results/treatment plan.  I won't lie, waiting for biopsy results is a nerve jangling time. I coped by crying in the shower, watching AbFab and the odd diazepam Please try not to do your head in with what ifs...your here now and that's all that matters. Keep looking forward because Cancer is a fast moving rollercoaster once your on it, and when you get off it you'll look back and think 'what the heck just happened !!' I've finished my treatment. Tomorrow is my first day back at work since May. I'm not the same person I was, but hopefully am a more relaxed, positive version. I still have terrors, it's part of me forever, now, but it's not the dominating focus of my day anymore.  Some things to tell yourself.... Just put one foot in front of the other Don't beat yourself up, it's nothing you did Remember to breathe and try to eat You are so much stronger than you realise Sending you a big hug and take care❤️ Kerry  Xxxx",

What can you do but be swept along with it all, clinging for dear life to your treatment plan, your friends and family and the hope it will all be okay.  Yippee indeed, for the end of your rads I've just been in for my follow up. I haven't set foot in the hospital for 10 days and I found I was really dragging my feet to go back there.  Isn't it funny how those dates are imprinted in your brain.  I am looking forward to going back to work, but only do two days a week. I need to reclaim some of myself back from the cancer.  My advice to you, for the week following the end of rads would be to book a pedicure or a facial, go for coffee and cake, or a lovely walk with friends.  Do things that make you happy❤️ You deserve it  Kerry xxxx",

I've got a creative muscle and it needs some excercise.  I'm not sure how much skill I've got, to be honest, but it's something I feel I need to do. Part of my mental recovery.  Glass making sounds amazing!   I took my kids to Pilkington glassworks last year. It's in St Helens, Ormskirk. My grandfather worked there. It was brilliant, but very hot, watching them making it all. I'd be fascinated to hear how you get on.  In the meantime have a lovely holiday  Kerry xxx",

I was just wafting along in my life, and now I've been jolted out of that. No pain no gain! I wouldn't have chosen cancer as my waker-upper, but there you go. If I have changed ( and I have) it's because I needed too.  I'm really excited about my art class, my family think it's brilliant.  Kerry xxxxx",

      "Content": "Hi lovely people Well last Friday I had my last radiotherapy. Yay! Unfortunately we don't have an 'end of treatment' bell in my hospital but let me tell you, I was ringing in my head!! It was a strange feeling. I didn't feel upset, just quietly confused. How did I get here?  On Saturday I had a bit of a crash, felt very sorry for myself and on Sunday I just felt exhausted.  On Monday, however, I felt much better! I was worried I'd be missing my routine and not know what to do with myself.  Instead, on Monday I met friends, on Tuesday I had a pedicure and on weds I went, with my lovely 15 year old daughter, for afternoon tea and a show in the West end. We had so much fun ❤️ Going to the hospital everyday for 5 weeks is very draining, it just makes you think about cancer a lot! You can feel very vulnerable and out of control when your lying on that bed, waiting to be zapperoonied.  Now it's done with I want to choose what to do with my day and it doesn't have to involve hospitals all the time.  When I think back to May, to my diagnosis, it's like another time. Your life has defining moments like this. Before and after kids, before and after marriage, times when you can say that was who I was THEN and this is who I am NOW. I don't feel the same person as I did back then, that person seems more naive and innocent. The person I am now feels older and wiser-ish and knows a hell of a lot more about cancer than she ever thought possible.  All the blind panic and terror I felt seems a long way back, though it's barely 4 months. So much can happen in a short space of time.  I feel like a sock that's been turned inside out, the one that gets stuck in the washing machine door and misses the spin. Edward Monkton could write one of his odes to me ' the sock of confusion' or something.  I don't really know who I am anymore. I really am 'trying to find my new normal'.  But I'm not miserable, I think I'm coming to terms with it all a bit more everyday. I try to be positive and I have a little rule.  Do things that make you happy I'm cautiously optimistic that I've turned a small but very important corner.  Just keep putting one foot in front of the other  Don't blame yourself, it's nothing you did. My very best wishes and love to everyone Kerry xxxx",

      "Content": "Dear Chris, I would just say, I found I needed to go to the darkest place, to prepare for the worst if it came. It's the way I cope with bad stuff. 'Be prepared'. in my own way. Nobody understands, unless they've experienced it, but the waiting for all these results is an absolute mind twister. As others have said, once you know then your mind has a focus, what to do next, but in the meantime, ohhh it's terribly difficult.  Someone actually told me to 'put my big girl pants on'......I know she thought she was 'cheering me up' lol. I am a positive person too but cancer knocks you for six, and takes away all your 'normal'.  Chris, I hope everything goes well for you today, sending you love and good energy.  None of us really know each other but we all have something in common. And we are here, talking about it, supporting each other. Your never on your own xxxx",

      "Content": "Hi Maria, hope your feeling better this morning X  'Best out than in', as we say 'oop North. Glad your husband is helping you, mine was brilliant, after a few hiccups. I think having cancer sends you into this 'positive me' overdrive. There's so many messages that you need to be strong, fight it, kick its butt and be positive etc etc. That's a whole lot of pressure right there, without all the fears, sadness and worries your can barely get your head around. You might also be feeling like your whole 'normal' has disappeared in an instant, so we try to be 'normal' to retain that essence of us. After I was told I had BC I felt like I wasn't me anymore, I asked who am I? ( I'm still discovering the answer, and it's not so bad) As someone who is used to getting on with it all I found it hard at the beginning, to express adequately, how I was feeling. I could hardly explain it to myself at times. In the end I just had to say' I'm freaking out' or ' I'm feeling really down/scared/frightened'. Insert appropriate word.....! I think that helped my family help me, because they knew what they were dealing with and not tippy toeing around, unsure of what to say or do.  My message to you, Maria, is that your not usually strong, you ARE strong. Having a down day or feeling weak and helpless doesn't change the strength you have. Just readjust your sentence back to 'I am a strong, positive person but today/ right now I feel....' Insert your word Positive affirmations and breathing really do help. It shows your strength that you can let your emotions out and it will become easier and less stressful with time. Think opening a bottle of fizzy pop. If you shake it up its gonna blow! Nice and gently does it When it all got a bit much for me, or I didn't want to be the morning dose of Misery, I used to escape into the shower and bawl my eyes there. It helped. And it was warm! I had to endure Peggy Mitchell's demise, from Breast cancer/suicide, during my early days! I couldnt switch it off, from some reason. I don't know what made me cry more, the storyline or the wooden acting from Grant Mitchell! lol Hugs to you Kerry xx",

      "Content": "Hi EJM60,  This is true, about the generics, and it's not just cancer drugs. I have Teva tamoxifen. It agrees with me and I won't take anything else. I went to two pharmacies, both who said they only get 'whatever arrives'. So I went to Boots, had a chat with the pharmacist there, who agreed with me and put it on my record, to only have Teva. In November I picked up my prescription and opened it at the counter, only to find two different packets. They managed to find a packet spare and reordered the other for me, with much apologies.  So definately say something.   I always check the bag before I leave, make sure you get it when you still have a couple of weeks worth of tablets, to make sure you have backup, incase of errors. If the chemist says they can't get it for you, you are perfectly OK to go elsewhere. It's a big deal, because you have to take this tablet and live with any effects, everyday. So don't let them fob you off.  You might not feel like a lion, but sometimes you have to roar, albeit in a nice way Love Kerry xx",
