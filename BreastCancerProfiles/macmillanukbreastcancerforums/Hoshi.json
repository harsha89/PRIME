      "Content": "Hi, is anyone else going through treatment for breast cancer and trying to look after a young family as well?  I was diagnosed with breast cancer in the summer and have had two operations to remove the lump and the lymph nodes.  I'm now on the second cycle of chemo. I have two daughters aged 3 and 1.  I had to give up breast feeding the youngest one sooner than I was planning to which was heartbreaking.  My husband is being great but there's no getting away from the fact that going through chemo is hard enough as it is without having to look after 2 small kids! I'd love to hear from others about how they're coping in similar circumstances...",

      "Content": "Hey Lisa,  I actually found it easier second time because I knew what to expect.  First time I was scared as hell!  I've done 3 now and I do feel more tired but the sickness doesn't get any worse.  In fact I felt it less last cycle, I think because I was able to get so much rest.  My third cycle was 3 days before christmas which meant I was feeling crap for christmas but had all my family around me to help out with the girls etc so I didn't have to worry.  Next cycle on Thursday this week - it comes round so quick! Sounds like you've got yourself a good man there and you've done well to keep the kids in a routine.  Have you got the 'Mummy's Lump' book?  I found it really helpful for my 3 year old.  The story ends with them all going on holiday so we're saving up for one now.  Great to have something to look forward to! Good luck for the next cycle.  Let me know how you get on x",

      "Content": "Good to hear from others going through the same thing.  Although not good that you're going through it obviously!   Emnoo, how are you feeling now.  It's such a shock in the beginning and then such a hard thing to start the treatment.  Let me know how you're getting on.  Will be thinking of you. And Sallyj78 - great to hear from someone out the other side.  How I long to be the other side of all this treatment - especially the chemo.  How did you find the radiotherapy compared to the chemo?",

      "Content": "Nelvans, no wonder you feel emotional!  Being diagnosed when your baby was 3 weeks old - SO hard.  Your emotions are all over the place anyway with a new baby let alone what you're going through.  I would say that anger is a pretty legitimate response to your situation.  Don't be too hard on yourself. This too will pass. Lots of love x",

      "Content": "Thanks both.  Yes I am accepting all offers of help!  I am lucky in that I have a great group of family and friends looking out for me.  But really they can't be there 24/7 and I can't put the kids lives on hold so we all have to keep going somehow.  I find it really hard not being able to actively participate in life when I am feeling really rough and tired.  I kind of just have to let it flow around me.  I guess 'this too shall pass...' and all that  x",
