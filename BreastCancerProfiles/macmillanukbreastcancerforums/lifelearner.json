      "Content": "Hi Geneva Had same experience as you only a few weeks earlier.  Never shopped online and putting on weight relating to recent surgery and after-effects and would not want to waste my time (believe in customer service not inconvenience) with your plan to order from Nicola Jane then return items.   Just returned from Sri Lanka on eleven hour flight and five and a half hour time change yesterday.  So taking it easy today with jet lag.  Bought three large sized swimming costumes a few years ago in Caribbean.  Took them to Sri Lanka and swam in them alternatively every day for two weeks, with one side having obvious breast lump missing.  I sat around pool in shorts and t-shirt (with prosthesis in place) then changed into swimming costume in hotel room with journey to pool in sarong.  After long swim, straight back to hotel room to wash out swimming costume and replace with dry normal clothes and prosthesis.  So my problem with appropriate post-surgery swimwear now to be dealt with again for next holiday and not yet solved.  When around the very large pool area, knowing statistics for breast cancer, had good look round for signs of anyone else having problems with appropriate swimwear and found no evidence.  So just had to ignore my problem assuming nobody noticed. Good luck with your search and happy holidays.     ",

      "Content": "Dear Geneva Many thanks for quick response on your purchases from Nicola Jane.  Would love to know what you christened these!  Part of my problem was having very recent surgery and desperate around Christmas time to get a swimsuit for holiday immediately after New Year.  Had newly issued prosthesis for first time that was too big and heavy as in rush to get everything ready for holiday.  Went back to prosthesis clinic this week and now have much lighter but equally firm prosthesis that I am assured can be used for swimming.  The company that supplied this also offer swim wear online so will check them out.  Before Christmas did find that Decathalon has a wide range of large sized swimming costumes usually with detachable foam bust liners.  They have a small hole at the back of each bust shape where the foam liner can be inserted or pulled out.  I might go back at have another look but would have to enlarge the hole to get my new prosthesis into.  I very much like your idea of inserting a 'shower scrunchie' into the bust pocket.  Desperately need to get back to local council pools as need the exercise, with one offering weekly water aerobics class, and two with 33 metre length pools.  One is very, very busy and try to avoid.  The other is usually only used by school groups during the week and I have it all to myself.  Adjacent to this pool is a large sauna and steam room.  Most local people who pay to swim never enter the pool but sit in the sauna and steam room during their paid session.  I of course have to avoid these after a mastectomy!!!  Will have to get used to these as belonging to my past.",
