      "Content": "Hello everyone. I'm making this post on behalf of my mother. She began the menopause during chemotherapy. Throughout her treatment, she had several hot flushes which disturbed her sleep and general daily living, and they didn't help her anxiety, which was also very prominent during her chemo. She would like to know if there are any treatments available to buy to help with her flushes. However, she cannot shop at Holland and Barrett because she was warned that they have oestrogen in some of their vitamins and supplements, and her cancer was indeed oestrogen-fed. She has been recommended sage tablets by quite a few women, who say they really keep hot flushes at bay. Is this true? If it helps, she is currently taking tamoxyphen, ramipril, and is currently having herceptin treatment. Just in case anything for hot flushes cannot be taken with any of those. Thank you in advance, I really hope this wasn'tÂ  too long a post. :)",

      "Content": "Thank you Janey, I will tell her about evening primrose capsules. She has indeed been asking her doctor and breast nurse, but nothing seems to be helping so she's wanting to try a more natural route. I do recommend checking the ingredients list of anything you have from Holland and Barrett, some of their products are listed unsuitable for oestrogen-sensitive cancer. I believe it's all been clarified now, with products clearly listed, but it's worth checking out just in case. I don't know much about this myself, this is just what I have gathered from her preferences. :)",

      "Content": "Hello Janey, Apologies if you are worried, I'm not sure which tablets she was told. I've been googling this and from what I can see, they had a change in ingredients policy in 2010, turns out the extra oestrogen was from a paraben in some brands that Holland and Barrett sold. They turned all their stock around and haven't sold anything containing it since. I'm going to pass that information on to my mother as well. We don't live near each other, and we only keep in touch via phonecalls. I really wish I had looked into this sooner before ruling out shopping at Holland and Barrett. Now she can get her sage tablets with peace of mind. I'm hoping this helps you as well, I'll be passing this on to anyone who is concerned about Holland and Barrett.",
