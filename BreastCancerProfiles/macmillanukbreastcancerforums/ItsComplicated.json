    "Content": "Hi All This is my first time posting in a forum so bear with me, but I could do with any and all advice!  Like kittycat1, I can see that the posts are old but hoping some of you might still be active? My basics: Diagnosed in June 2016 with TNBC, 8 months of chemo, then surgery in March 2017(double mastectomy and immediate implant recon), then radiotherapy.  In the August of 2017, when I was all settled with near-perfect, well-healing implant recon, my first infection started. In the last 18 months I've had more than 10 severe infections, requiring multiple ops, 5 different size implant, permanent and expander implants, before my surgeons and I agreed to a 'rest' period. During the rest period I've moved to the specialist plastics team in St. Thomas' to reconstruct my mangled left 'flat' side. Ironically, apart from some tightening (to be fixed with lipomodelling when this is all over), my right side is more or less perfect, even thought it was irradiated.  Anyway, I'm in the final stages of deciding on an SGAP (I'm quite small and it's the only option for a number of reasons) but I'm starting to feel guilty about choosing to put my family through this all again (It's been a long couple of years of emergency procedures and interruptions to family life). I don't want to be left with the body I have now, not after all I went through to keep some sort of breasts, certainly not when I'm still in my early 30s, but I'm feeling a bit isolated with no one else who has had such complications or an SGAP to talk to.  I'd love to know how you got on with your surgeries, if you went through with them and any suggestions/advice you would be happy to share? Thanks so much and wishing you all well.  ItsComplicated xx",
