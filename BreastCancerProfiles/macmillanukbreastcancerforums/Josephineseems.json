      "Content": "Hi Bethanerin1, It's early days yet after your surgery.  I had similar sounding surgery and I can still feel it (mildly) after 2 months.  Sometimes the scar stings and sometimes it itches as you go through recovery, or at least it did for me.  Apparently that is the healing taking place?  Hope all goes well for your results. Take care. ",

      "Content": "Hello  I followed the link and read a short article. Did you mean you found the NICE guidelines somewhere and read the whole thing?  I was just about to post a query as I have been prescribed ibandronic acid a biophosphonate (sp).  I have not started the tablets yet as I am a bit scared of the side effects that the oncologist and the leaflet inside the packet warned against.  Mainly about indigestion as I do get this sometimes and it can be painful.  I just wanted to ask if anyone else had started on these tablets and what your experience is.  The article says the tablets are 'well tolerated'. ",

      "Content": "Hiya Batfinkcaz, Thank you for replying to my query.  It is good to know that you are not having any digestion side effects from the ibandronic acid.  I know everyone is different but it gives me hope.  I hope Friday goes smoothly for you.  Will you stay in hospital after the op?   Today I go for my CT scan before radiotherapy - as you say what fun we have!  Yesterday I went to a friends anniversary lunch - the first time I was in a social situation in many months (due to having chemo).  Quite a few people were coughing and spluttering in an enclosed room and today I have woken up with a cold (the reason I didn't go out much during chemo was a low immune system).  I hope I am not burdening you with my troubles. The hot water trick you have sounds good. So at what point do you drink hot water (e.g. how long after you have taken the tablet?).  Does it make the tablet melt before it reaches your stomach (as the instructions seem to want it to reach the stomach intact as quickly as possible so as not to effect the esophagus)?   Thanks and take care x",
