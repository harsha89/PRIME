    "Content": "I\u2019ve one mole on chest like since years. It looks bigger to me. It doesn\u2019t look uneven but scabbing. Not sure about that too cuz it\u2019s basically a light brown and dark brown center with broken kinda part. I\u2019ve a pain in armpit too. Can\u2019t see any swollen nose though. I\u2019ve a pain in the area of gallbladder since so long. I\u2019m going to get it checked out this month. What this mole possibly can be? Does it sound like cancer? It\u2019s flat not ozzing neither bleeding. I\u2019ve some prominent veins around it. It\u2019s on the right side of my body. Please help! Im so worriedÂ ",
