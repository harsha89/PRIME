    "Content": "I was wonder if anyone has read the new e-book by Rolf Hefti called \"The Mammogram Myth: The Independent Investigation Of Mammography The Medical Profession Doesn't Want You To Know About\"? Here are a couple of excerpts from the author's site (http://www.themammogrammyth.com) about his extensive evaluation of mammograms: \"The story of breast cancer mammograms is largely the story of spinning insignificant or non-existent benefits and downplaying well-known risks. It's the story of acknowledging those \"facts\" that support the medical orthodoxy's dogma of the cherished screening modality while ignoring the substantial, highly relevant facts invalidating their dogma (i.e., myth). According to the claims made by modern medicine, mammography \"does no (or little) harm\" and \"saves many lives\". However, the scientific facts, unlike the medical profession's dogmatic proclamations, reveal that neither assertion is accurate. Orthodox medicine arrived at their pro-screening views by ignoring, obscuring, and carefully hiding, a large amount of well-established facts (\"inconvenient truths\") that threaten one of their central, and most lucrative, medical interventions: the use of medical x-rays.\" AND: \"But you will only know \"what is going on\" with mammography if you're awake, rather than sleeping. Being awake means having an alert, questioning mindset. Being asleep means compliantly accepting, without questioning and being critical, whatever the medical profession, or anyone else, propagates. Only if you're awake, will you let light (the truth) in -including light from the \"other side of the fence\". Only if you're awake and let light in, no matter what \"side of the fence\" it originates from, can you orient your life constructively, by avoiding dangers and enjoying benefits. As far as I'm aware of, this (e)book on mammographic screening is the only analytical report available, anywhere in the world, by an independent researcher (=someone not tied to the mammography-medical industry, or anyone else) that methodologically and comprehensively addresses the three most important questions women have about this breast cancer exam, as cited above. The work is the end result of a 3-year investigation. I began researching the popular screening method in 2010 and first published the (e)book in 2013. I poured over hundreds of studies and investigative accounts (the (e)book contains over 850 references and contains around 100,000 words [=a full-size book]). The endeavor took up an extraordinary amount of my time and efforts to find the real facts about mammographic screening (and so you don't have to do that research, unless you want to).\"",
