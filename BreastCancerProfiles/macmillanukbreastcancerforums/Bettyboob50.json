      "Content": "I had my bilateral mastectomy without reconstruction on the 29th February and things didn't go as planned and I had to have 7 units of blood and stayed in hospital for a week. Then my breasts filled with seroma which was drained every other day about 800 ml then the scar opened and the consultant pulled out loads of blood clots after that I was flat. I still have opened wounds and am leaking so the district nurse is coming every day to dress them. I have had 1 infection about two weeks ago and now I am feeling feverish and achy so the nurse stabbed the wounds .",

      "Content": "I had breast cancer in 2011 and had a lumpectomy followed by radiotherapy. In December 2015 I went for my yearly mammogram followed by an ultrasound and biopsy because they found a lump. In January it was confirmed and in February I had a bilateral mastectomy . When I saw the oncologist he told me that they found three different cancers 1 was hormonal and another was grade 2+. When I went to see the oncologist I thought he was going to tell me when and where I was going to start chemotherapy. Instead of this he told me due to having Addisons disease, Rheumatoid arthritis,fibromyalgia, sleep Apnea, I could not have chemo because if I got an infection it could give me sepsis and kill me . I was so upset because you automatically think that chemo will kill off any cells that have got through to your body and that safe guard has been taken away from me . Has anybody else been refused chemo ?",
