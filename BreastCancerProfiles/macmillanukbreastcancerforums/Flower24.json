      "Content": "I have to say that despite trying to keep my chin up, carry on as normal and smile, I am finding it very difficult to be enthusiastic about getting out of bed and doing everyday things. I thought I was doing so very well after my first battle last year and my visit to my GP this week which resulted in her announcing that it best to get my latest swelling checked has really taken the wind out of my sales. I have always been the person my family turns to for support when things go wrong, but after the events of October with my daughter, my family is really rock bottom (I only have my daughter, my son and my Mum). It shows how worried my son is because usually I have to shout him to get up for work if he has to be out of the house very early in the morning (self employed and sometimes leaves at 6.30 am or earlier) but last night he announced he had to be out by 7 this morning and please would I set my alarm and phone alarm to make sure he got up.  Lo and behold when my alarms went off and I was lying contemplating getting up - I heard him padding along the landing to the bathroom very quietly.  Amazing - and very unusual because he hates mornings. He's come back in tonight, got his tea and said his friends are taking him out to cheer him up which is good. Personally I'm just lacking energy, and frankly after the recent events I cant see any point any more in trying.. I think it is the fact that I had felt the swelling a couple of weeks ago but was sure I was mistaken.  I only went to my GP as a \"just in case\" check.  I think I went to see her hoping she would say I was imaging things. However it seems I was right and my swelling needs checking.   I think I am scared of what my lovely Consultant will say after I've had the tests and maybe what I will have to face.. I could do with a big cuddle from someone but I am a widow.   I was introduced to a fella but I discovered he was married and not only was he married, he had appeared in court in August for stalking his ex girlfriend (who he had told me had died from b. c. but lo and behold she is alive and kicking) - he was convicted in September and it turned out actually he had a record for stalking her in 2008 and 2010.  I found all this out just before my daughter lost her unborn baby in October a few days before my birthday and then this new swelling rears it's ugly head. Talk about bad luck - I can't take any more and just want something really nice to happen for a change. Hey hooo - I need to get a grip and stop being maudling. Big hugs to everybody",

I got myself so upset tonight when I logged back onto the site earlier tonight I somehow managed to get my wires crossed and posted something on a totally different Group (can't think how I did that but I was crying at the time).

      "Content": "Hi Ella, I was like you just before Christmas however I thought I had found a difference in my opposite side to where my op and treatment had been in 2013. Like you I went through hell. However, I ended up telephoning the Consultant's Secretary to ask her if the Consultant had received the results of my test and if not when would he get them? This triggered a chain reaction and suddenly I received a telephone call from the Consultant with the results. As I understand it, a patient has tests, the Consultant receives the results and discusses the case at the multi disciplinary team meeting the following week to put any care plan in place.  Then it is after that the patient receives the results. I sincerely hope the results you receive are the same that I did. In the meantime, until you receive your results, big hugs, try and keep smiling and hold your head high xx",

I'm now very lop sided as my WLE is actually underneath my breast - the scar runs right where my breast meets my body and the bra band sits . One side is a lot larger than the other and errr.........when I put a bra on with clothes on top (eg a blouse or t shirt), it just doesn't look straight. Do the medical team have a solution for WLE bra issues or is it up to the patient to sort themselves out? I keep trying to tell my BCN about it to trigger them investigating my problem, but it doesn't seem to register what my problem is. I had my WLE on May 17th. At the moment however, I only wear a bra when I go out because of where the scarring is and quite frankly it is uncomfortable. big hugs to everybody reading this xx",

However that problem is just a small one compared to what other people on the site are dealing with, plus I have to face my radiotherapy for the first time next Thursday.  I'm not sure how I will handle that. Thank you for your suggestion and taking the time to respond though - I really appreciate it.  Best wishes and take care, xx",

      "Content": "Hi 1Caroline, I didn't know whether or not to write my post - I did not want to upset anybody but I wanted to give encouragement. I had a lumpectomy - after a time recovering I was ok.   It seemed to take ages with the booking in procedure - answering questions with a nurse, then my lovely Plasto Surgeon coming with her team to mark me up and tell them her \"plan\" (I caught a glimpse of her markings in a mirror - I have to say I didn't know whether to laugh or cry with her thick black ink markings on my breast) - however I just thought to myself (to stop me being scared) -  \"these people are doing their best to try and help me and take away what could be a major problem if not stopped) I was in hospital just one night and discharged to the care of my family. Fortunately I did not need chemo but I did have to have Rads. When I went into Rads - well it was scary (more a fear of the unknown plus the fact you are in a room by yourself) However I asked the Radiographer person to tell me everything which was happening at anytime. So it stopped me feeling out of control of what was happening. The whole process of Rads only took a few minutes away - it actually took longer me getting changed and the team setting me up for the machinery. So - all things being equal after your treatment hopefully everything will be ok. I wish everybody facing treatment lots of luck, lots of care and you must not expect yourself to be able to do what you could do before you started treatment straight away - always be gentle with yourself and above all remember what I always say on every post - if you have any worry, any problems, any questions - tell your Breast Care Nurse Specialist or write a post on here - (everybody on here is amazing) - if people do not know your worries, your questions, your thoughts etc - then they cannot help you. Best wishes and big hugs x",

      "Content": "Hello,  This is very interesting because I was going to put up a post and ask the very same question!  Have or Had?  I also vaguely remember my Surgeon telliing me when she came on her rounds and I was still half anaesthatised, that the operation was a success and it had all gone! However, then my Consultant Oncologist told me the operation was successful but I have to have radiotherapy for 15 days (I'm counting down to starting on Thursday), and I also have to take Tamoxifen for 5 years.  Then he announced that they could never say I was cured but my prognosis was good.  So I think I came away from seeing him not really knowing if my op was successful or not, if I was cured and better......or not. However, like Dorotheeee, I didn't feel unwell before I started this rocky journey by going to the Gp's because I thought I felt a lump where I shouldn't have had one. Sorry, but I can't say one or the other, but thought I would join in because I would like to know what to say to people when I see them.  I think my best choice is - I am a Cancer Patient however I don't have it now.  This is because I am still having treatment to prevent it rearing it's ugly head again and returning.  It's a lovely evening so big hugs to everybody and lets try and enjoy it xx",

      "Content": "Hi folks  Earlier in May I had my first review session with my absolutely lovely Plasto Surgeon following a lumpectomy in May 2013. She told me that everything looked fine and she would order a mammogram just to make sure. Eventually the appointment came (16th June 2014) and I trotted along a bit scared - boy the pain was excrutiating because of where my op scarring was in relation to the framework of the machine - it brought tears to my eyes. Anyway my brilliant postman has just been (he's ace delivering out to us in the countryside down a farm track in all weathers despite getting his van stuck loads of times in deep snow) - he brought with him a Private & Confidential letter from hospital. Ohhh god I thought to myself because I realised what it was before I opened it! I plucked up courage and carefully dragged out the letter........YEAAAHHH the nurse specialist wrote that she was happy to confirm there wasn't anything showing in my recent mammogram to cause concern. I feel soooo happy. I just thought I would write and let everybody know that if you can manage to keep looking at the positive there is a chance your treatment will work. I know that there are people on here who aren't as fortunate and those who are just starting the long haul of op, chemo, rads etc - please try not to worry and know that the medical teams caring for you are doing their best. If you have any fears, questions or just want to say how you feel you must let your Cancer Nurse Specialist know - they are the people who can trigger other help. Also use this forum as a screaming board if you must - it is better to let out your feelings (no matter how bad they are) because to keep worrying on your own only makes things worse - feeling good about yourself is part of the battle. Thank you to everybody on here who over the last year have read, listened and supported me through what has been hell! At least I know I'm ok for at least another year - onwards and forwards. Best wishes and big cyberhugs to everybody xxxx",

      "Content": "Hello people,  I have read this thread with great interest this morning.  All I can say is that the staff in the hospital where I am having Rads have treat me with the utmost care, respect and consideration - this includes the male Radiographers although I think there are just 2 or 3 in the team.  I don't have time to think who is watching the cctv when they are lining me up because I'm too concerned that they understand I am scared stiff about it all and need them to talk to me over the intercom letting me know when the zap is going to start, break, start stop - radiographer come back, move machine, zap start and all finished.   I had a really rough time last week, I mentioned it to a Radiographer, they flagged it with a Radiographer Care Specialist Nurse who took me in a room and talked to me about my fears and worries.   I too was subject to verbal/physical abuse by my ex partner.  When I went into hospital for my op and was in the waiting area, I was lucky because as soon as ladies started to change into gowns all the men with their partners were told to leave.  The wards were mixed but seperate (ie they had sections or rooms for men and seperate ladies).  I think for anybody with concerns no matter how large or small, they need to flag it up with their BCN or Radiographer Care Specialist.  From past experiences in my life I work on the principle if people don't know you have a fear or a worry / problem then they can't help you.  So shout out to someone and let them know.   Not sure if this is the way most people deal with things, but I just tell everybody and anybody how I feel - I don't care what they think of me - I just let them know I'm not happy.  Take care folks, and big hugs to everybody xx",

However, in relation to the discussion about treatment and costs etc. I have various health issues and for many years had a \"Medical Exemption Certificate\" due to the fact I have to take certain medication for life for one of the issues. Ask your GP or Breast Care Nurse for a form to apply for that. Alternatively if you get \"Income Related\" ESA - note \"INCOME RELATED\" which means you have filled in a form showing all your income and outgoings - then the Jobcentre people have written telling you they will pay £x to you - you automatically are able to get prescriptions free plus contributions to your transport costs. If you are unsure  of what you have or what you are entitled to - phone the brilliant MacMillan Support Line - they have wonderful specialist benefit advisors who can help you or put you in touch with one at your local MacMillan centre / hospital so you can talk face to face. Don't be worrying about money when you are dealing with cancer - you have enough to be worrying about and there is always a way to sort things - the people to advise are the MacMillan Advisors - they are magic!

Anyway I took the bull by the horns so to speak and telephoned my Consultant's Secretary and explained the missed calls and also explained that only the hospital and bank know my mobile number so by process of elimination I decided it was hospital. The lovely Secretary said she had actually got my file on her desk and after typing the \"ops notes\" she would be doing my letter which the Consultant had left her to do. She said she would phone me back after 11 when she'd typed it. Sure enough, bless her, she phoned me and read out the letter - it was the best Christmas Present I've ever had! The letter said that my Consultant had great pleasure in informing me that my recent tests and scans showed no sign of Cancer Spread from my original Cancer on the other side!  He said follow up reviews would be made as previously planned after my original op and treatment. So I feel on top of the world. Thank you so much to everybody who sent me notes of support - you have no idea what a help you have been and how much I appreciated being able to read them. I thought I would type this post so that those facing treatment will know that there can be light at the end of the tunnel and despite what you might think when you first hear the word \"Cancer\", somehow it can be beaten and held at bay. I hope you all have a peaceful and happy time during this Christmas Season, God bless, Valerie xx",

      "Content": "Hello and good morning to everybody, I thought I would just drop in and see who is about and what is happening on the site. I also wanted to say thank you to everybody who supported me on my journey through treatment for Breast Cancer. Whilst I had Stage 2-3 (it was midway) invasive and non invasive cancer which hadn't spread and I only needed my lumpectomy and radiotherapy follow up, it was such a scary time. All you lovely people encouraged me and helped to pick me up when I felt so low and I am so grateful you are / were there despite sometimes struggling with worse problems than I have had. I realise that I have written posts about my 88 year old Mum having BC in 1998 and she is still going strong, but I also know that when your Consultant sits you down and says the words \"it's not good news I'm afraid you have a Cancer\" - it absolutely floors you. I have kept my Mum as a focus through my journey. On Thursday I saw my Oncologist person who told me I have had the best possible care and treatment for my Cancer, everything seems to be as it should be and he is discharging me back into the care of my lovely Consultant Surgeon's team.  I have my next appointment with her in 6 months times. So, despite my Cancer, my Rheumatoid Arthritis and Fybromyalgia, somehow, with the support of everybody, I feel quite positive. For those who are taking the first steps on the rough and rocky road through treatment for Cancer, please make the best use of everything offered on this site.  The people who either use it or are involved working as part of Macmillan Support Line are absolutely brilliant. It's a lovely sunny, blue skied day so let's all grasp it and enjoy it. Best wishes to you all, xx",

It would have been nice to welcome you to the ball but people can't split themselves into two and be in two different places at the same time. I hope your review goes well for you, just work on the principle that if the doctors/surgeons/ oncologists or whoever did your treatment properly last year, then you will be fine. Re the more mature people of this country - I agree with you, they seem to have a different outlook on life to everybody else and somehow keep going. Like you I wish my father was here now - just a couple of minutes to have him wrap me in his strong solid arms and tell me everything will be fine would do me the world of good. Hey ho............thank you so much for your good wishes, Let's all walk tall, keep smiling xx",

It is amazing how the more mature people manage, keep going and handle the worry of their child's diagnosis - I know mine left my family reeling for a few months but my mum dealt with both of my children (young adults) worrying and being upset as well. I hope your mum enjoys her birthday as well,  Lots of love and best wishes xx",

      "Content": "Hi Folks, Hope you are all managing to keep smiling through I know what can be very tough and worrying times. As some of you will know I have organised The 1st Inspiration and Hope Summer Ball for Friday 12th June 2015 at The Mercure Royal Hotel Hull. However due to a struggle to sell tickets because of 3/4 charity balls in the same area within 4-6 weeks - I have dropped the price and tickets were £60 with table for ten £550 Tickets are now £45 each or a table for ten £400! This will make the event break even with tickets sales (unless a business steps up to the plate and sponsors the event) but with the auction and raffle prizes at least some extra funds will be raised. It is a charity ball with a difference because we have a Champagne Reception, Three Course Meal, a full cabaret show running as well as Auction, raffles etc and the usual dancing.  Plus it is a live music event with no DJ or backing tracks.. The proceeds will be split three equal ways between MacMillan, Neo Natal Intensive Care Hull and Special Care Baby Unit Scarborough. (Just thought I would give it a mention - tickets are on sale now if anyone wants to go give me a shout) The hotel have given a discount on double / twin rooms with two sharing including breakfast at £60 per room for ball guests (password on the reservation which will be sent with tickets) Anyway that is not why I am here today...... Monday morning I received my hospital appointsment for my 2nd year Annual Review and Mammogram after my original Breast Cancer treatment. I was sailing along organising the ball quite happily but I have to say seeing the appointments and what they were for written in cold black and white really knocked me for 6 for a couple of days and made me remember just what a scary demon this thing is which causes so much chaos in our lives. On the other hand I have to say that considering the guest of honour at the ball is my Mum who will be celebrating her 90th birthday on the day Mum is / was a Breast Cancer sufferer - she had her mastectomy wayyyy back in 1998 Plus she has also had 2 seperate operations to replace heart valves (it was going to be a big family party but then I had a secondary cancer scare just before Christmas which really scared the living daylights out of me - which is why I turned the party into a charity ball) So if my Mum can keep going despite all that has happened to her I feel sure I can even though sometimes it can get a bit rocky and rough. Big hugs for everybody - especially those who have just been diagnosed and are scared xxx",

      "Content": "Hi Moonspeed, Hello to you, It is unfortunate you find yourself in the position of having to join \"the club\" so to speak. However, on the site there are many many people who have either survived treatment, are undergoing treatment or just starting treatment for Cancer, all these people are wonderful and do their best to support each other (or so I have found out since I joined at the start of May this year). I have Rheumatoid Arthritis / Fybromyalgia so I know exactly what you are talking about and can relate to you perfectly. I was diagnosed with BC early May. I was told the same as you WLE, radiotherapy and Tamoxifen for 5 years. I had my WLE on the 17th May and am recovering from my op, albeit with a little hic cup of uncertainty here and stress there (but the folks on the site helped me through it). I was told by my lovely Surgeon to stop my meds for RA/ F a week before my op. Then I was told by the Consultant Oncologist to stay off them until after my Radiotherapy has finished because the meds will exacerbate the side effects of Radiotherapy. Re Tamoxifen, I have been taking that for 10 days now. My body is still adjusting to it so I am taking it with an open mind. After all, if it stops the Cancer turning up again it's worth any hassle I think ! A case of choosing between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea..... However my Oncologist diverted me to Tamoxifen from his original meds because they would make my pains worse. Every hospital appointment I go to I make sure that the first thing I say to the Nurse, Doctor or whoever is when they start talking to me is......... - I have RA / F as well as the Cancer ! I also made sure that the team who cares for my RA/ F are aware of what is happening regarding my Cancer treatment. That way, hopefully both teams will work together nicely to give me the best possible care they can. I hope this helps you. Try not to worry tooo much, although I know from experience, when you first get your diagnosis all sorts of things go whirling round in your head. Ohhh and above all, don't go searching round on the internet for information about your Cancer you will scare yourself silly - stick with this site because they are the experts in caring for people like us. Best wishes and big hugs from me xxxx",

I ended up going to my GP because I had spent a lot of days in bed with major migraine type headaches, dizziness and generally disorientation. I also suffered the hot flushes and my face had brown blotches. I hadn't had those problems before I started taking the Tamoxifen My GP wrote to my Oncologist person asking for guidance but told me that whilst Tamoxifen is doing good in one way is it worth the effect it is having on my quality of life? (Mind you I also have other health issues including Rheumatoid Arthritis and Fybromyalgia to contend with) So I would take yourself to your GP and tell him/her what is happening and get them to write to your own Oncologist to get guidance. I work on the principle if it works ok but if it causes me problems something is not quite right and needs dealing with. Good luck, take care and cyberhugs to you and everybody else in our boat x",

Boy the cobwebs really got blown off because I live in the countryside and there are open fields on the lane which is on a hill - I have to say the wind was lazy because it went straight through my all weather jacket, scarf and woolly hat. Then when I got home, because I needed some more wood for the fire and my son was out working I set too - I got son's axe and set about log splitting! He's got a new axe this year and it's got a really heavy head so as long as I got the action right and a rhythmn the axe head did the work and not so much me. I have to say it is very good therapy and I felt so much better after getting rid of my frustrations (although I must also say I was shattered afterwards) However I have to warn - if you decided to do a bit of log splitting be very careful! I must remember to do a little log splitting every day - I feel a lot better than I did before. Enjoy your evening xxx",

He mentioned that he would discuss me in the weekly Big Team Meeting and get everybody's opinion what to do. Lo and behold he actually phoned me this afternoon!  I was amazed. He asked me what my thoughts were about a MRI scan and was I claustrophobic - which I confirmed obviously yes - and he said he thought he remembered me saying something about it. So he's booked me for a full CT Scan instead!  Apparently I will get my appointment in the next few weeks. I will just have to grit my teeth and close my eyes and try and think of something spectacular happening to me because it took the lovely Rads people 3 attempts to do my target markers for my RADs in the CT Scanner the last time I was treated  (anybody know a nice tallish mature millionaire to sweep me off to a desert island and park me under a Palm Tree with a Pina Colada?  I'm in desperate need of something good happening to me for a change) Big hugs and try to keep smiling folks xxx",

      "Content": "Hi Spammie, I've just logged on to see what is happening with people and spotted your posting. You have made one major good move - you have asked for support and help in the right place. Also I think MacMillan Support Services offer counselling in local areas - perhaps if you phone the helpline and talk to someone in the offices they can guide you. Whilst you need to be in \"your own space\" and have made the decision to be away from your husband prior to your diagnosis etc - you say (as someone has already pointed out) that you say there are things you don't like about him and don't love him, which is not a really good basis to return or try to rebuild your marriage. When someone is ill, and going through what can be really traumatic and tough treatment path, they either have the personality where they thrive on people fussing and caring and need lots of people near them all the time, or, they prefer to handle the somewhat challenging events and treatment quietly in their own way. If you are from the latter group, it still helps to have someone close to you - so perhaps you have other family members who can help you. I have thought carefully as I try to judge how to make suggestions and feel that your husband saying he has changed (since he learnt of your diagnosis etc) and wants you to go back to him - I'm inclined to think that deep inside you have already made your decision. As I have said, try phoning MacMillan Support on Monday when their offices open and asking if you can have a counselling session because you are finding things very difficult . Until then - just use this community to let rip if you have to and let off steam. Another possible helpline to use is - The Samaritans - they listen quietly and whilst they don't offer solutions, they help you talk through your problems and clear or put your thoughts into some sort of order.  Their number is:-  08457 90 90 90    They are open 24 hours a day,  Also you need to make sure your Breast Care Nurse is aware of your current home / marital upset - because she can help support you. At this time you need everybody concerned with your healthcare to be aware you also have other problems you are dealing with. Sorry if I've rambled on and I sincerely hope you somehow manage to sort things out so you (nobody else matters unless you have children) - you are content and happy with whatever decision you make about your husband. Take care and big cyberhugs xx",

A few years ago when I split with the fella I was with after my late husband, I wasn't well (breakdown) and my GP medically retired me. Then I got Rheumatoid Arthritis / Fybromyalgia The people at my local Citizens Advice Bureau helped me sort out my benefits, but not without me first trying to do it myself.  That didn't work well because I wasn't mentally fit enough, but what I will always remember was the person from the Benefits Office telling me to calm down and that from my records I had worked every day since leaving school. She said therefore I had contributed to the \"pot\" and, seeing that I wasn't well, I had worked near enough 30 years without asking for benefits, I was entitled to ask for assistance from that \"pot\". I don't think of myself as a \"scrounger\", although I know full well there are loads of people out there who haven't got a thing wrong with them but claim benefits. I have just got notification that my Incapacity Benefit (long term) will be changing to the new Employment & Support Allowance so I am going to be reassessed to see if I should be working. This is at a time when only last week I finished my Rads. I think this Government expects people who are claiming benefits because they are ill for one reason or another, some very ill and recoveriing from treatment for serious illness, to go and do 10 hand stands and 16 cartwheels followed by standing on our heads for 10 minutes on  the lawn outside the Houses of Parliament to entertain the Ministers in their tea break! I'm 60 this year too.  Best wishes and big hugs to all xxx",

I think that I had the best night's sleep last night I've had for a while and the burden I've been worrying about and carrying seems to have been lifted a bit. I went to the supermarket this afternoon and got some strange looks as I was ambling up and down the aisles trilling away in my somewhat tuneless tones to the pipes Christmas songs but hey - do they know what I know?   Life For The Moment, Catch Each Minute and Hug Each Other Like You've Never Hugged Before Because You Never Know What Is Round The Corner!

      "Content": "Hi again, UPDATE on my CT Scan - I've just had a Brainwave! I went out in the garden with the family dogs and looked at the stars (we have wonderful night skies here because there are no false neon lights) and was pondering the events of the last few months in my family. Then a thought struck me...... It is pointless me worrying about my CT Scan Results because:- 1.   The Consultant Radiographer has to study them and send his report to my Consultant Plasto Surgeon person 2.   The Consultant Plasto Surgeon has to study what the Consultant Radiographer reported 3.   The Consultant Plasto Surgeon takes the report to the weekly Cancer Team Multi Disciplinary (everybody from Nurse Specialists to Physiotherapists, Radiotherapists and Consultant Surgeons) and they will discuss the report and also everything else to do with me. 4.   The Consultant Plasto Surgeon will do what he did after my initial visit to the One Stop Cancer Shop and phone me with the action decision after the team meeting. Alternatively, if the CT Scan was clear - then I will receive a letter So I came to the conclusion that it is pointless me worrying and fretting because I've had my test and scan and I'm waiting for other people to do whatever they do with the results of the tests and I will be the last to know what is going on. Trouble is I have to concentrate on relaxing now and not worrying.  That is one very hard thing for me to tell me to do. Never mind - I'm pleased I had the brainwave though because everything seems simple now. Enjoy your evening folks x",

I didn't have a full mastectomy - my op was a lumpectomy.  The healing process I went through was bad enough so what everybody who has a full mastectomy must go through really must put you through a turmoil. However back to your post - many years ago (at the turn of the century in fact - boy that makes me feel absolutely ancient) - I had to have a full hysterectomy. Now, I couldn't do a lot for 6 weeks and then build myself up gently. I remember that when I went for a post op inspection my lovely Surgeon described me as having had my body attacked! He told me that whilst I had given permission for him to do it, he had physically attacked my body with a knife - and my body had been through trauma. He told me to treat myself gently.  He also told me not to try to jump through hoops straight away and build up my activities and certainly not try to drive for at least 8 weeks post op. I applied that scenario when I was recovering from my breast lumpectomy - and took my time. Re the cording - you should get referred to a physiotherapy session to teach you exercises to help you with the cording.  I think you should telephone your BCN if you are struggling with it. If I was you (which obviously I aren't) for the time being don't drive, try doing very gentle arm exercises to get the fluids moving a little bit from your arm (but only very very gentle arm lifting and only just a few at a time) Ultimately though - speak about your concerns to your BCN - he/she can't help you if you don't tell them you have a problem or are worried. Sorry to have rambled a bit too much but I send you big cyberhugs, Take care xxx Take",

Like you I was sooo very very scared and worried when my lovely Consultant Plasto Surgeon turned and told me it was bad news and I had Cancer. I looked at this wonderful site for information about what was wrong with me etc (as you do) and spotted the online community and joined. You will discover, as you put up posts and sort of log your treatment journey, that joining the site is the best thing you could have ever done. People on here are so supportive despite struggling with their own Cancer issues. The thing which shocks you at the beginning (I think) is the fact that before you were diagnosed with Cancer whatever it's form, and you heard of a friend, relative, work colleague being diagnosed, you always thought it was something that happens to everybody else and wouldn't happen to you. Suddenly it's put on the table in front of you that it is your turn to face up to it. Things are good, it hasn't spread, once you start your treatment it all fits into place. It's the waiting for diagnosis and waiting for the next treatment stage which I find are the worse bits. As has already been said to you, be gentle with yourself and take care, big hugs xxx",

I got my phone call to go for my Rads planning/ target CT Scan this morning so I'm feeling a little bit scared and vulnerable at this time with everything going on.

I'm very thirsty and drink lots of water but it isn't recyling properly and my body is steadily becoming a balloon. Has anybody got any ideas. When I saw my GP on Monday about not sleeping I mentioned I thought I might be having water retention problems but she just said keep taking the tablets because they will stop your Cancer returning. So I'm not too sure what I'm supposed to do. I was getting to be quite slim after my body swelled up with Rheumatoid Arthritis / Fybromyalgia joint swelling but that was brought under control by medication for that. I don't want to swell up again because I've always been a slimmish type of person with a small bone structure (opposed to heavy boned). Does anybody have a magic solution for retaining water please?

However I'm sitting watching Text Santa and I've sat with boxes of tissues watching the VT Storylines about the various charities. The storyline which really got at me is the stories of young people who are under the care of the Teenage Cancer Trust! It made me think about my problems and I thought to myself, I've been lucky, I had a very comfortable childhood (an only child and I'm afraid my wonderful late Dad spoilt me rotten), I had a sort of happy married life apart from late husband throwing me down steps from our pub apartment when I challenged him after finding him with our cleaner at a friend's Christmas Party. Then I got in a relationship where the fella became violent and I was scared to remove him from my home until the Police had to be called. I got over that and was eventually diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis/Fybromylgia. Then after getting used to that last year I was diagnosed with Breast Cancer. My review this year showed \"nothing to cause concern\" but as people will know recently I discovered another lump on the other side and I'm waiting to find out the results of a CT Scan. I have to say in the years with both my late partner and late husband I did have some good times.  Also without my husband of course I would not have my two Aces (my children / young adults) However those young people who sadly are in the care of the Teenage Cancer Trust are still in the youth of their lives and to have to fight such a disease as Cancer with the bravery and charm as the young people on Text Santa show really made me think how fortunate I am that at 61 my health problems have only just surfaced in the last few years.

Today I have been really really down and upset with myself and feel I'm on a downward spiral. I saw my GP last Monday about not being able to sleep properly and she gave me some sleeping tablets. However I haven't dared take them until last night when I was upset so I took one so I could at least get some proper sleep. I have to go back again on Monday to see my GP. Then on Tuesday I have my CT Scan / target practise for radiotherapy. My son and daughter (23 yrs) have started to fall out because my son lives with me (18 yrs old) and is generally the person who cares for me day by day and he had a bad night last night with all his hidden worried coming to the surface in the form of a frustrated temper and shouting match over nothing in particular. Both son and daughter aren't eating properly because they are worrying about me. Trouble is, I think I am lucky, my Cancer was Stage 2 (3-5 cm) with also DCIS and no nodes. I think I got away very very lucky and my lovely Surgeon was brilliant and I keep reminding myself of that. However I feel bad because I know on this site there are a lot of people who are a lot worse off than me. Yet I feel very very scared about my Radiotherapy and also in case it comes back. I don't know what to think anymore. Big hugs to everyone on here xxx",

However knowing people do care (particularly those folks on this site) makes me feel a weight has been taken off my shoulders because I know I am not facing all this on my own. I'm now feeling a little bit more positive and looking forward to the end of my Rads and then, as prescribed by you :- a hot bubble bath, a glass of bubbly, candles etc. Thank you again, I hope you are all having a peaceful type of Sunday afternoon, big hugs to you all xxx",

Everything seems to be coming along and smacking our family in the face with a wet kipper and say you aren't supposed to be happy - stay down there in the gutter! Hopefully something, somehow will happen and cheer us up. It's just one thing after another trying to face this big mountain we''re trying to climb. I've been trying to climb it since the beginning of May and I'm still at base camp! Well, I think I'm going to plan a party for when I've finished my treatment sessions, have a few drinks (one too many - anything more than a couple of glasses of wine and I'm flat on my back anyway) - that will give me something to look forward to.

I've had a really troublesome day (if only I was a good 40 years younger I would have enjoyed my trip to the dentist - he is absolutely lovely) I lost my bank card between the hole in the wall and the car after that Spent lots of time chasing around contacting the bank and then of course I needed to get some money somehow (I had only got a bank account balance before losing my card) Then - I spent a good 20 minutes talking to a DJ on local radio about The 1st Inspiration and Hope Summer Ball I've organised with MacMillan getting a third of funds raised. After spending this afternoon cold calling more businesses and getting nowhere because the people I needed to speak to were either in meetings after the bank holidays or actually on holiday this week I am now sat contemplating the fact that in the morning I have to battle through rush hour traffic and somehow park my car in the hospital car park then go and face my Cancer Consultant for my 2nd year review following my op in May 2013. My appointment is 9.25 - I suppose I should be grateful because I won't have all day to be worrying about it. I really hope that everybody who faces their Cancer Consultant tomorrow gets good or positive news and send everybody a big hug.  xxxx",

Re femininity - sometiimes it might actually affect you!  It may not affect you now, and you may laugh but in this world there are many ladies who have had their bodies altered somewhat by BC (or other forms of our friend Cancer). Having the op, treatment etc leaves us all with scarring - you may have your own problems as a man with it. How you react to them, and they to you with altered shapes etc - affects both of you.

      "Content": "Hello again everybody, Yes things do happen for a reason - when Angelina Jolie had her double mastectomy and BC was in the headliines, that was around the time I was first handling my diagnosis. San somehow you are going to have to try and get your Mum to watch one of these storylines.  Like you she has had a shock and is probably very very frightened for you. After all she is your Mum, she brought you into the world, she raised you and now she's been told that her little girl has BC.  She will want to do everything for you but won't know how to deal with the news herself. She will be worried about you, your family and everything.  You both need time, you both need to try to be gentle with each other and try and get back on common ground again. Maybe write her a letter perhaps or ask see if you can make an appointment with your BCN and ask her to go with you so that you can talk about things ..........together. Re bringing BC or any Cancer out into the open - it is usually a hush hush subject which people daren't talk about, but I think nowadays with these wonderful storylines everybody is learning it is good to talk. In previous threads I have talked about telling people I have / have had BC.  They usually turn away.  However my answer to that is........how many of those people who turn their backs on us with BC know exactly the state their body is in under their \"perfect skin\"? We know what is wrong with us and we are dealing with it the best way we can, let them walk in our shoes! Big hugs and cuddles to everybody - in fact everybody turn to the person next to them (if they have someone) and given them a big hug!  If there isn't anybody then here is a big cyber hug just for you xx  ",

      "Content": "Ohhhhh big hugs and cuddles to you San........ This is the thing about words on a screen - sometimes when people try to offer support and maybe advise, they are not aware of the bigger picture and can sometimes get it wrong. I really hope your son is alright and sorted out, and yes, when you are trying to handle your own diagnosis, your own treatment and feeling totally rotten, you are inclined to feel that the whole world seems to be against you and everything just goes wrong (been there, got the badge and the T shirt) I found when I told people about me, (and also in the past when my late husband passed away very very suddenly many years ago), you find out who are the people who you can rely on, which people you can turn to for help and advise, and those who are \"just there\", standing close by in the shadows, ready to catch you when you need support. Those people standing close by, are sometimes people you wouldn't expect, because they don't say anything, however when the chips are down they are there.......... and they listen and support (The Samaritans) - you don't have to feel you need to wait to ring them when things are really desperate - you can phone them anytime just to offload your hurt, your upset, your feellings.  It is good to talk - it releases bad energy. I think when you have been given your diagnosis and have gone through treatment, you will never ever be the person you used to be.  You can't be because your body has virtually been \"attacked\" in the best way possible to help you.  It affects the way you think - it's bound to. Of course there are people who are so besotted with their own lives, they turn against those who need them - sadly that is the way a good few of the population behave nowadays. I really hope you gain some sort of \"normality\" in your life, that you and your son can manage to get through everything and come out smiling. As my children said to me when I first told them of my diagnosis and was absolutely rocked and upset with everything - they said \"Come on Mum, you can get through this, you are a strong lady, we've all been through worse and survived so this should be easy for you to handle\" (I don't know if they were trying to encourage themselves or trying to put a brave face on things - but I remember the look on their faces and how they demanded I handle the diagnosis and the treatment so I am there for them) Anyway, I wish you lots of love, a big cyber hug and best wishes, xxx  ",

      "Content": "Hello folks, I'm having a little while pondering about things before starting my day. I'm not sure if I'm ultra sensitive, but have you noticed that recently Cancer seems to be creeping into the world of tv soaps? Actually, Chrissie's storyline in Holby City is very appropriate to us in our Breast Cancer Group. I made my son watch it.  Purely because he doesn't really understand how I feel, and I think the way Chrissie's character has been dealing with it portrays the fear, the panic etc. Then of course there is the MacMillan tv ad promotion - which is absolutely excellent.  Again, when it was on, I flagged it to my son, to explain to him how it feels when you are told you have Cancer! (My daughter understands better because she attended all my appointments with me and was there when my lovely Consultant Surgeon at York told us the news and my BCN put her arms round us) I find it quite wierd though that this year of all years, BC has been put firmly in the spotlight on tv. Well, have a good day people, hope everybody is feeling as good as they can be, big hugs, x",

      "Content": "Hi everybody, Firstly thank you so much for taking time from your own problems to try and support me. I think at the moment, because apart from my son and daughter I am on my own (widow), with what has only just happened with my daughter I just aren't feeling strong enough to handle my own problems. As I know I must get myself looked at but daren't, somebody pointed out that that would be making me feel worse (which is true). I know that I'm on a roundabout and need to step off it. This isn't me, I am usually a person who acts when things need sorting out but I just can't find the errr.........strength. I can't go to my Breast Care Team because I think that because it is the other side I have to be re-referred if it is something which needs checking.   (I'm sure that when I was having treatment with the B.C. Physio for lymphodeama she told me that my file was closed until I go for my next annual review) However, after reading all your messages I have decided that after I've had my morning walks in the morning I will go to the GP's online appointment system and make an appointment to see my favourite GP on Monday (my own old GP retired earlier this year so I don't know all the new doctors apart from the part time lady doctors who job share). I think half my problem is that I miss having a partner / husband to wrap his arms around me and make me feel that everything will be ok however unless a miracle happens the chances of that happening are nil. Thank you again to everybody for your support / encouragement and I really hope your own treatment goes well xx",

      "Content": "Hi all, Hope you are handling life's challenges a bit better than I am today.  I'm sorry and afraid I only come on here nowadays when I'm feeling a bit down and I don't offer all that much support to others (purely because I need support myself before I can help others). I wish I was brave enough to come here more often and offer support to others but I just get depressed and upset with things if I do and that doesn't do me any good at all. I'm a widow (heart attack years ago), I then had a guy who became abusive / alcoholic/addict and was removed for my family's safety. Then I met a guy earlier this year who asked me if I was sure I was alright because the lady he was with before had BC - but didn't catch it early enough!! That triggered me going to my GP - of course obviously he was right and I ended up having lumpectomy and radiotherapy - finished on 31st July 2013. The guy of course said he couldn't handle my diagnosis and that was the end of that. So, being on my own, I've handled the op and radiotherapy, tried to handle the emotions etc by myself (with a lot of encouragement from my daughter and son - ok they tell me I'm a strong person and can handle anything so I can get through all this and also all the wonderful people on this site, who have your own problems to handle) - however I really would like to have someone by my side. I tried various avenues but, I think it's best to be honest and open - my life is an open book and it's pointless trying to hide things because they only come out in the wash. So when I meet up with people (or even before I meet them) - I lay my health cards on the table and tell them I have Rheumatoid Arthritis / Fybromyalgia and ohhh by the way this year in May I had an op for Breast Cancer with follow up radiotherapy. The cancer is gone now and it was caught early before it spread so I'm ok and just want to move on and enjoy my life. However, it seems that the male population who are looking for a lady to be by their side, are looking for perfection without any hassle because after going out and talking about my health issues, I just get messages about how nice I am BUT .......... and wishing me well for the future! There again, my point of view is that I am 60 in October, do those men in my age group who are \"cherry picking\" their perfect lady, know what is going on under their own skin? Maybe I'm getting cynical in my old age and very very fed up with myself. I think I'm going to get dressed up as a trashy, tatty tart tonight and tag onto a Hen Party, get plastered, fall over in heels far too high for me to walk in, use bad language, start fighting and then after another two or three shots start pole dancing and stripping! Perhaps I might find myself a millionaire who is looking for a \"bit on the side\" ha ha ha There again after I've done the fighting, started pole dancing and stripping, one look at my patchwork quilt and the club will be emptied!  So that won't work will it.   Just need something magic to happen to cheer me up.  Hey ho onwards and forwards, I'm going to go and get a lottery ticket and see if I can win a fortune to go on a cruise for my birthday...... big hugs to you all, Flower xx",

      "Content": "Hi, Some people on here will remember me from my somewhat lengthy replies to people telling my story in the Lung Cancer/ Carers and also the Breast Cancer Groups as I tried to offer support, encouragement and hopefully an occasional solution to people. I rarely felt the need to come here for myself recently because my Breast Cancer was last year in May with a Lumpectomy and Rads.  My Cancer was on the \"rim\" of my right breast / where it joins the body.  My first annual review showed \"nothing to cause concern\". However, as you do when you have had the diagnosis of Breast Cancer, I check myself regularly and I'm not too sure whether or not there is a small manipulative swelling above my left breast but it is also where there is bone structure. The swelling definately moves but is small. However, I keep picking the phone up to make an appointment to see my lovely GP but I put it down again because I think I know what she will say. Frankly, in a nutshell, I am scared what a visit to the GP will trigger. My family had a major crisis in the last two weeks with my daughter losing her first unborn baby (would have been my first Grandchild) and sadly my family had a bit of a meltdown so I don't think I can cope with the stress of going for tests. Plus I'm not sure if it needs checking if it comes under Breast Cancer because it isn't actually on my breast but above it. I'm not sure what the best thing to do it - I am mentally exhausted with worrying about my daughter and really don't think I can cope with anything else at the moment and I'm scared. Sorry for whinging but needed to put how I feel, big hugs folks x",

      "Content": "Hellooooo Everybody, I rarely drop in nowadays because I had a lumpectomy and rads treatment in 2013 but then late 2014 I had a major secondary cancer scare because I discovered another swelling on the opposite breast.. The brilliant people on this forum and MacMillan cajoled, encouraged and basically told me to get myself to my GPs and then I had to face going to hospital for tests including a CT Scan with definitions (instead of MRI because I'm totally claustrophobic and have panic attacks) The CT Scan was described to me as being my friend because if I didn't have my friend then nobody would be able to either decide if something was radically wrong with me and if there was something wrong then a treatment plan could be put in place. Thankfully, after all tests I got a brilliant telephone call on December 23rd from my Consultant telling me Happy Christmas, he hoped all my wishes came true in 2015 and that he was delighted to inform me that all tests showed \"nothing to cause concern\" and my Cancer care plan following my previous treatments would continue. However that is not the reason for my posting today. When I got my news I went a bit crazy - it is my Mum's 90th birthday in June this year (she had a Mastectomy in 1998 - so she's a bit of a trailblazer) - my daughter, son and I were planning a big family birthday party, but once Christmas had been and gone I suddenly decided to repay MacMillan and organise a big charity ball instead! So there you go - one charity ball to look forward to on your Calendar - Friday 12th June 2015 Although the funds raised will be split between 3 charitable causes:- MacMillan Cancer Support The Neo Natal Intensive Care Unit at Hull Royal Infirmary The Special Care Baby Unit at Scarborough General Hospital I have organised a full cabaret and have allsorts of donations for raffle and auction however I'm still putting the framework together before going to print with posters tickets etc but I have a web site online for the ball which I will post once I have the tickets available. BUT to get back to all things MASTECTOMIES........ I have discovered a specialist Lingerie Shop in Hull (where I originally come from and the ball is being held) - whilst contacting businesses for donations. The owner is specially trained to fit ladies who have had operations and the shop specialises in undergarments / lingerie / swimwear for ladies who have had a MASTECTOMY. It is on Hessle Road Hull and it's name is Serenity Look it up and go along if you live in the Hull area (I've copied their Facebook address for you) Serenity-The Lingerie Boutique. Mastectomy Specialists. Lingerie shop Address: 18 Hull Road, Hessle HU13 0AH Phone:01482 641777 https://www.facebook.com/pages/Serenity-The-Lingerie-Boutique/215601828451412?sk=info&tab=overview You never know you may come out feeling a million dollars! I hope this has made everybody feel a little bit better if you are feeling a little bit upset and worried. Always remember when you go to hospital that you are a miracle and you are also a walking text book for medical students - they watch your consultations - they watch your examinations and tests - they watch your operations etc.  So you are helping to train the next generation of medical staff. If you have someone near you, turn to them and ask them to give you a big hug and you smile - you are a miracle! Big cyber hugs to everybody xxxxx",

      "Content": "Dear D., As a Mum who recently went through a similar route of biopsy, and then told what was wrong, and what my treatment plan my heart goes out to you because you are going through what my own children went through this last month. I have two \"young adults\" and their Dad passed away when they were little so they are in somewhat of a similar situation to you. Your Mum is now in a safe cocoon of being treated by her Consultant and Breast Care Nurses who, with her, will plan whichever treatment is suitable for her once they have the results of her biopsy in front of them. She was probably very frightened when she found her problem and didn't dare face up to what would happen once she reported it to her Doctor. However she plucked up the courage and she went and she's had her tests which is a good thing. Unfortunately between the tests, biopsies etc and the start of treatment, there is the \"waiting game\" - while the biopsies are at the lab and your Mum's next appointment with her medical team/ Consultant. I found that this is the worst part and a week seems to become a year as each day passes until the moment you walk in the room to see your Consultant to find out the results. Once you have got her results and know exactly what your are dealing with then in a funny way it is easier because you aren't wondering if the problem is one thing or another. You have proper facts. You must remember that whilst you feel the need to put on a brave \"front\" for your family, you also need support. You and your family have had a big shock and don't be afraid of showing your feelings and if you feel the need to weep in front of each other - weep then at least you will all know how much you each need support. (working on the theory that if people don't know how you feel they can't help you). I would like to suggest that you make big use of this site's Online Community, however maybe your first contact must either be to go and talk over what is happening with your own Doctor or, contact your Mum's Breast Care Nurse. You need to be able to talk over your own feelings, so that you in turn can support your family. When my late husband passed away suddenly (heart attack), my GP told me to be \"gentle with myself and not expect miracles\" - with the explanation that if I didn't look after myself I wouldn't be able to support and care for other members of my family (in my case at that time my young children) I know your Mum will get the best possible care and I wish her, you and your family all the best in this troublesome time, Big Hugs to you all, Flower xx",

      "Content": "Hello, Like you I don't really come on the site all that often but dropped in today and spotted your \"thread\" about being \"strong\" ! I can relate to you because I was widowed when my 2 children were 7 and 2.5.  It is a shock and something which rocked the boat a bit but I got through it. Then in the next 18 months my Mum had BC / MX complicated by also having heart issues treated with warfarin so instead of a quick in and out of hospital after her MX she was in for over 8 weeks because she was soo poorly. Later that year my wonderful rock of a Dad passed away with Lung Cancer. I got with another fella and was with him for a while but he turned nasty - ... During all that I was the person everybody was turning to because \"I WAS STRONG\"  and \"I was good at sorting things out\" When I was diagnosed with BC, my brilliant daughter was with me, her face dropped to the ground on hearing the Consultant Surgeon, but she quickly turned and said to me that Come on Mum, you've got through worse, you can beat this \"You Are Strong\" ! Meanwhile I was sat there with my mind going blank. Somehow, I think when you are an individual and been through a lot of life changing events whilst young, dealing with allsorts of unexpected or expected trauma and upset, those around you automatically expect you or think - You Are Strong! I just turn and say to my family when they turn and ask me what to do about something because \"I'm good at sorting things out\" - I just say Ive run out of steam, and it's their turn to try and deal with things themselves because I need them to be strong for me. It might sound harsh, but at least they know how I feel. Hope all is well with you and don't worry about the surgery, as you say everybody is an individual, if your lovely sounding Surgeon says he can reconstruct - be guided by him. After all if you have a bad toothache - you go and see the expert (a dentist), if you need your house rewiring - you get the expert (an electrician) soooo you have a lovely Surgeon specialising in treating your problem - so see what he can offer and take his advise (well that is what I would do anyway)   Best wishes to you, xxx",

      "Content": "Hello, Like you I don't really come on the site all that often but dropped in today and spotted your \"thread\" about being \"strong\" ! I can relate to you because I was widowed when my 2 children were 7 and 2.5.  It is a shock and something which rocked the boat a bit but I got through it. Then in the next 18 months my Mum had BC / MX complicated by also having heart issues treated with warfarin so instead of a quick in and out of hospital after her MX she was in for over 8 weeks because she was soo poorly. Later that year my wonderful rock of a Dad passed away with Lung Cancer. I got with another fella and was with him for a while but he turned nasty - ... During all that I was the person everybody was turning to because \"I WAS STRONG\"  and \"I was good at sorting things out\" When I was diagnosed with BC, my brilliant daughter was with me, her face dropped to the ground on hearing the Consultant Surgeon, but she quickly turned and said to me that Come on Mum, you've got through worse, you can beat this \"You Are Strong\" ! Meanwhile I was sat there with my mind going blank. Somehow, I think when you are an individual and been through a lot of life changing events whilst young, dealing with allsorts of unexpected or expected trauma and upset, those around you automatically expect you or think - You Are Strong! I just turn and say to my family when they turn and ask me what to do about something because \"I'm good at sorting things out\" - I just say Ive run out of steam, and it's their turn to try and deal with things themselves because I need them to be strong for me. It might sound harsh, but at least they know how I feel. Hope all is well with you and don't worry about the surgery, as you say everybody is an individual, if your lovely sounding Surgeon says he can reconstruct - be guided by him. After all if you have a bad toothache - you go and see the expert (a dentist), if you need your house rewiring - you get the expert (an electrician) soooo you have a lovely Surgeon specialising in treating your problem - so see what he can offer and take his advise (well that is what I would do anyway)   Best wishes to you, xxx",
