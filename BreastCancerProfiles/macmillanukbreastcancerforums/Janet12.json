      "Content": "This might seem like a trivial question amongst all the threads about treatment, but I've never been in hospital before and am anxious about the experience.  I still have appointments to go yet before getting a date for my surgery, but think the timing of it is likely to be such that I have no one to be with me afterwards.  I think I can probably manage being at home, but what's really stressing me is how I'm going to get home in the first place.  Everyone knows when you go into hospital you lose some of your belongings - not sure if they get stolen or just lost when they keep moving you to different beds.  If I lose my money and keys there's no way I can pay for the taxi and get into my home.  If  my phone goes missing, I won't even be able to call my cat feeder for the spare keys.  Does anyone know if there is any facility for keeping belongings secure in hospital.  If there is lockable storage, is there a facility for the key to be kept secure while you have your operation?  Even if there is, will the key be found afterwards and will it be known what cupboard my belongings are in?  Surely I can't be the only person in this situation.  ",
