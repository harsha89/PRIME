    "Content": "Hi all, I'm new to the group but just looking for peoples experiences. I am 37 and after finding a lump in my breast I was diagnosed with breast cancer a couple of months ago. I've had a mastectomy and recovering well, and it hasn't spread to the lymph nodes. I have my first chemo on 1st may and doing fec chemo.I have 16 month old twins who have managed to keep me well distracted! Do other people on here have little ones and going through chemo and how has it been? I have no idea of what's ahead of me and wondering how able I will be to look after my twins...looking at nursery for a couple of days a week, my partner will have them one day. Also worrying about all the bugs they will catch as new starters at nursery! Anyones experiences would be great to hear....Also any tips on a essentials survival kit for chemo! x",
