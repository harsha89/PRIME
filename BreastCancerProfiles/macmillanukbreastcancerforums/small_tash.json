    "Content": "Hello all, Just wondering how long people waited after chemo to begin taking supplements again? Last chemo was 5th Dec. I did x4 TC and herceptin (herceptin ongoing then tamoxifen in new year) and was told to stop taking my usual vitamins which were: - Turmeric - Activated charcoal (good for keeping tum in check) - Vitabiotics osteocare tablets (vit d, calcium, magnesium, zinc) Going on holiday 29th (doctors all happy) and would like to start taking for then ideally, Thanks! x",
