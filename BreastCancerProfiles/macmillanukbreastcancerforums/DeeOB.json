      "Content": "Hi, I had 3 tax followed by 3 FEC. Absolutely no problems on the Tax, the FEC is significantly harsher on the veins. In pain along the length of my vein after the second FEC, fortunately was able to use the other arm for the third as I had not had surgery at that point. Vein continued getting worse then lump developed at the top of the vein just under the crease in my elbow, extremely painful turns out i had phlebitis (infection of the vein), with cream and antibiotics eventually went although vein remained tender for around 2 months. Vein is now just a dark colour and I assume no good, not that I can use the arm now as surgery now completed. Left with a tingling in my fingers which I am still hoping will go - they told me 2 weeks, 3 months on still here. The Piic is a line inserted so you don't have to go through the process of having a cannula every time you go for chemo. Warm regards Denise  ",

      "Content": "Hi,  I remember the first 2/3 weeks after my diagnosis  walking around in in a state of shock. It is true though you do get to a level of acceptance ( as much as you wish it would go away) and get on with the practicalities of the treatment. I was also asked to take part in the AVASTIN trial so did lots of internet research. I decided against it based on my opinion of risks v benefits.  Drop me a private message if you want to discuss anything in more detail(chemo/surgery/trials), Warm wishes Denise",
