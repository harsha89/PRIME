      "Content": "Hi x baby wipes -non perfumed - they are great for freshening up as you will have to avoid any kind of perfumes near your arm or breast. I used them fir weeks after my Mx and lymph clearance they are perfect. Johnsons is recommended as best, just been for my 1st radiotherapy and I'm back to those again :-) A little cushion to put under your underarm to keep it supported is ideal as it will ache and you will feel very insecure for a couple of days. It also helps with relaxing as you'll find it stops you being so tense. V shaped pillow also helps when you home for sleeping as you won't be able to lie on your side for awhile. Good luck Hun xx",

By nearly I mean it could be in next 6 months but apparently usually uts 2/3 months. Wud go in tomorrow if they let me. Scan on breasts in Thursday, closure scan as 6 months since MRI at a different hospital to check out left breast aswell. Hopefully still fine then that's it till op!! Still so strange. Good luck to all we will get there xx",

I too have a holiday booked and hope my op doesn't coincide lol x strange when my main worry is what to buy to wear for a wedding that suits a skinhead hairdo! And not next chemo or radio. Back to work too and it's as if I've never been away. My boyfriend keeps saying how proud he is and what I've been through is massive and I think now I'm off the treadmill of treatment I need to acknowledge that and rejoice.

I have a temporary expander in my right breast after mx so I was expecting discomfort or something but so far so good. Obviously I have another 11 to go but you don't feel a thing when it's being done. The travelling back and forth is a pain, unless it happens to be near u? There may be issues ahead but nothing compared with what I've already been through and you will have too. In all honesty, and I hate to sound flip, it's boring!! Hope it's just as boring for you too :-) it will all be explained in your induction then after that it take ten mins tops. Oh and take a book just incase they are running late etc moisturise with cream and rear as hopefully this is the last step of a long journey xx",

I guess what I'm here to say is I feel GREAT :-) it was rough after it all ending so anti depressants were necessary for me and it took a while to accept that and ladies they helped so much. My life now is better than before. I know how important life is and I'm living it. Been to Finland, back out with the girls, back to work full time even doing overtime lol and just came back from rocking it at V. I still come on here and check you all out especially those that helped me get through this with kind words and support. Lifes there ladies just waiting for u and u will get there.

I feel this cancer has took everything from me and I have no control over my own body. I can't hurry things and honestly would love nothing more than my eyelashes back. My wigs awful n gives me headache, weight gain is ridiculous no matter wat I do. My body just seems so alien to me. Funny but my expander being bigger than my normal breast dusnt bother me that much. Strange!!! I need to get a grip for my kids, my 17 yr old daughter has been through so much with me, she dusnt deserve more grief. But ive managed to hold it together so far but the cracks are beginning to show My recent words to her of looking like Voldemar with boobs cracked her up !

I know several people who have had lumpectomies and had loads of issues with infections,scars etc One of my cancers is common to be found in both breasts and I was disappointed they wudnt let me have a double mastectomy but it's against policy as it was clear.

Going to a friends which I have refused up till now and generally getting back to life but slowly. I'm still bit wary. But if feels good. It's not gonna win. Chemos over, dates for radio booked in. Time to move on. It does get better ;-) just gotta be more open n admit those bad days, when a release is needed, but back on the horse as soon as yr last tear cried.

My surgeon was going to put in permanent implants but decided against it due to the RT. Is there no way you could have temp expanders like me? Or am I missing something.

I didn't have radiotherapy straightaway as I had chemo but the chemo did affect my breast and arm, tiny bit swelling and exercises started up again to avoid cording. Finished my chemo feb 14th and then RT started on march 17th. I have just 2 days left on RT. I can honestly say the RT hasn't been an issue at all except again a little bit sore, just round my scar and again small restrictions in movement but exercises help. It's tiring only in the travelling and probably mentally as I know it's coming to the end. Dunno if this helps you but if I hadn't had chemo I think I would have been fine going straight to RT. Obviously it's a different op and we are all different. Hope you get it sorted xx",

      "Content": "Hi Can anyone tell me,probably those who have been through all their treatment, why I would need a ultrasound scan only 6/7 weeks after radiotherapy finished. Got the appointment on Friday lunchtime and then went to an 'end of treatment' session with other ladies and our BC nurses My BCN was telling everyone it would be a year before we would be checked. She was totally baffled as to why i would have an appointment and asked to see it She is going to look into it and get back to me but that won't be till at least tuesday. Have to say I'm worried. Only saw my oncologist once during RT and was just a formality but now I'm wondering if something has shown on scans before RT or what. I'm not due to see her till July. Any ideas ladies? Bit scary to be honest. Xx",

I too spent nights on the sofa unable to rest for the pains, mouth jawbone legs head etc etc I was advised to use tramadol and on my 2nd dose I was a lot better tho the flu like symptoms were awful. But suprisingly my third has been ok, I coped really well and found that all the side effects were dramatically reduced and just the tiredness remains. Hope this is the same for u, I know it's different for everyone. Take care xx",

It took about 4 weeks to settle but does get better. Just don't overdue it. You shouldnt be ironing hoovering etc for at least 6 weeks Ironing used to really set mine off so then I would have to rest my arm for a couple of days. Any use of your arm affects your breast muscles and that's your issue. It is hard but worth it. The tumours are out and that has to be a good thing. I have to tske care all the Time with lifting etc and mine was back in sept 2011 I'm having a little trouble with mine now due to RT but I know it will settle. I too will watch with interest for replies. But I'm assured by my BCN this is normal. Xx",

I think he's a feeder really bless him, but I'll get help for him later haha It's the only time. 3rd Tax.that he was with me so I can honestly say it must have helped.

It's quite difficult and I'm still waiting, last tax feb 14th, for the party um going to have when my prodigal eyelashes return !! Miss them sooooo much. As for hair ! It's absurd ! Why Did I have to weekly get my eyebrows done before C and now they won't grow.hair on my heads grown but the grey/dark curly/straight, long/short sparse in areas look isn't in Vogue from what I can see !! Still least it's growing :-) on day 11 of radiotherapy and it's a breeze. Bit uncomfy today as expanders tightening a bit but that's it.not a problem except the long journey daily to have it done. Seems a bit of an anticlimax after all we've been through. Back to work in 3 weeks on a two hour day phased return. Can it be that life is getting back to pre last September. Guess what Is bugging me now is that I don't want to look like a cancer victim now, so guess it's wig time. Not keen as the tension headaches were awful but the looks you get, and we've all had them and worse!! Are what i find hard to cope with now. Enuf is enuf. Time to get back on the horse ! Hope radio is as easy for you Suzie and look forward to your post Trish when you are done with yucky chemo. :-) keep safe and smiling lots hugs xx Oh and day two of tamoxifen ! Should be fun.

It's normal practice but I would call your chemo unit and ask your questions or u will just worry and that will do u no good.

I was offered cold cap but was lead to believe that the chemo would not work where the cold cap was as this means that cancer cells could grow there - I just said no thanks I too got a wig but haven't worn it and just use scarves and coped well till I lost my eyelashes then went into meltdown but falsies on and coping better :-) Ready to start with wig now as bored with scarves - ready to start getting back to normal.

I pushed with my surgeon, though just slightly as no need for anything else, to have my left breast checked out, as there was changes noted on my original checks before diagnosis. Just breast changes but I was concerned. They sorted an MRI and thankfully was clear though I'd still love a mastectomy in my left too, but they won't carry it out in healthy breasts. Something I intend to try and take further. A couple of weeks isn't going to make any difference but for peace of mind speak to your BCN and stress you need it done.

Any tops that ate easy to get on and off without any effort. A small cushion for under your arm is brill fir sleep, relaxing or just generally to feel comfy. My hospital BC gave me a Hug in a Bag and it was filled with allsorts from a BC pen to hand cream and the vest thing was a hand made heart shaped small cushion which was for under my arm. Bliss ! Honestly really helps. Music a must as u will be too tired to read. I agree anything to freshen your mouth - fruit sweets, mints, biscuits if u feel bit sickly. Hope goes well xx",

Your post reads from someone who has accepted, in a way as we never really accept it all, and are working out in your mind how to play it, to the least effect on your family. That's the first stage for most of us women on these paths. And it's this attitude of love and caring for family that will get you through. I too was horrified at my diagnosis, so scared for my kids, as a single mum although they are 17 and 22. Thought how on earth do I get through it - well it's a ride you get on and you can't get off till it's done. And you will find strength, we all do. I'm now through mastectomy, lymph node clearance, chemo and radio and I'm not brave. Just has to be done. It went by so quickly in hindsight and there are times when you feel low but you get up and get on with it im now on a 2 week break before back to work, was diagnosed in sept 2011. Feels like yesterday. Yes looking back there are things I would have done differently but none was about treatment, just throw everything at me was my request. You sound like you have a strong family and that will help soo much. I wish I'd had that. Hide your bad days from your children if you need too but share them with someone, you need support as well as you supporting your family. You can do this.

Once you know what you are facing and treatment starts then in a way it's easier, well not easier but you can organise your battle plan. I still remember how scared I was. All I thought about was my kids and how I couldn't not be there for them. I'm recently divorced and they don't have a great support network. My son through treatment didn't say much but when he did it was to the point. When feeling ill with chemo his response was ' well at least you know it's working !' and he was right. My daughter has been fab, my son lives with his flatmate but my daughter was stuk with me,she was there with the scarves false eyelashes and the typical needs of a 17 yr old that got me through lol ! You have to do this for them. Many many women have the chemo first to shrink it, I had 2 types lobular and ductal and no option but mastectomy, everyones different.

      "Content": "Why can't doctors carrying out scans just say if it's ok or not!! Post treatment and had a scan. Don't really know why but BCN checked and said it was 6 month review from MRI I had to check out left breast as cancer type usually in both. Ok ! I understand that. So why did she, a foreign elderly dr who I have had before and she was the same then! Asked me what the problem was !?! I don't know. U asked me to come in! Then she read reports ignored totally my left 'normal'' breast and concentrated on the area under my right armpit and down the side of my expander !?! She never said a word even though I asked a couple of questions. Then took my prints and left the room stating she needed to check other results!! And never came back?!! The young nurse had to go and ask her if I could go home!?! How ignorant! I was told to go home and now left baffled as to what that was all about !!! Some bedside manner !! Well going to ignore such rudeness and have wine, great weekend with my lovely fella and our daughters doing race for life. Cos we are in this to win :-) xxx",

      "Content": "Hi Amanda I had my expander fitted in October, after removal of lobular and ductal. It was uncomfortable for a while and even now I have an aversion to touching the magnet. But the 'pressure' I felt with it has greatly eased and been fine till chemo. After every chemo session it is uncomfortable and tender but this wears of with the other side effects. However I have my 3rd and last dose of Tax next week and I am still uncomfortable and pained from last dose. Also if I carry something heavy or overdue using my arm then I know I'll have a few days of 'issues' with it. I'm lucky not too have any fluid so msybe as previously said that's the issue. I am still so pleased it's there but it is weird to say the least. So convoluted, strange to touch etc Hope it settles down or u get sorted real soon Good luck Janice xx",

      "Content": "Hi ladies. I'm finished all my chemo and RT so I'm at the other end of the journey. I had issues with losing my hair, as I had long hair, but in the end it was a relief as it actually hurt. Your hair follicles seem to be so tender so after 1st chemo off it went. I have used my wig twice and just stuck with scarves and am due back to work in a weeks time. I'll be happy with the bald look as it looks really edgy and to be honest my wig is a fright! I wish I had taken more time to get if right but too late. So take time and make sure you are comfortable with it as it will help greatly. As for eyelashes :-( I was unlucky and lost them all though not everyone does. I'm still in mourning but have used false ones lots of times. I just put them ine higher than my lash line and fill in under them with eyeliner. Works a treat :-). My last chemo was 14th feb so they are taking a while to come back but there is alternatives. I kept some eyebrows and basically joined the dots withan eyeliner and they are growing back. It's all a case of feeling as good as you can in this crappy path we have to take. But you do get out the other side just like me. Thoughts wit you ladies take care xxx",

      "Content": "Hi SC Never apologise about how u feel, none of it is very nice regardless of what treatment you need. I am about to start my radiotherapy after chemo and am a bit dubious bout what to expect. My first is on Saturday. I'm concerned as I have a temporary expander in after mx and it can cause issues. Still has to be done and then Tamoxifen. I live 223 miles away from my boyfriend and had only been with him for over a year, nearly two. Last thing we needed. My breast are totally different sizes shapes and not in the geographical area lol Joking aside I still find it hard to accept what it looks like but he has been amazing. Just try to talk and be honest about your insecurities. I'm still not great at it but luckily he's so supportive. I'm also bald and put on a stone after chemo and what upset me mist was losing my eyelashes ! It's a tough journey all round for all involved. You have a right to rant n give vent to your feelings. Thus is happening to our bodies and outside of our control and it's crap. But it's not forever and it will get better. You arent different just for a little while your body will be. Talk to someone if you need to. Councelling etc just don't bottle it up. I did for a while and it's not a nice place to be. Think if it was other way round - would it change how u felt about your fella? Course not. Probably make you love him more. It's hard but you will get there. Hope radio goes well for you. Let me know. Chin up, head high and take care xx",
