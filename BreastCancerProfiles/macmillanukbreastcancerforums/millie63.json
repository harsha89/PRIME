I haven't mentioned it to anyone medical as I thought it was just 'one of them things'. I'm awaiting rads appointment  within the week but am curious as to why I have this pain. It even hurts when I touch it and feels like I've over exercised it or something. x",

Omg my body feels like its been steam rollered and the opposite side to treatment is so painful to move I'd rather not  When I've spoken to oncology they always come back with the 'well its up to you' however 'anastrazole is the best treatment for you -here's some more painkillers'.  My children are saying the same as yours I guess and have even said I'm selfish for thinking of stopping. I want the me back that was there before all this started and this 'finding the new normal' isn't working. Sending you big gentle hugs xx",

Everything seemed to be going as well as and I know things are always at the back of your mind but nobody had mentioned chemo until two days ago. I am lucky because I almost didn't go for the mammogram. The trauma of the vacuum biopsy is still with me as the anaesthetic didn't take - that's another story. And at first I was like ok lets 'kick this' - the last week I've been more like I want to hide. I'm so pleased you're now recovering and wish you a really good Christmas. Thank you for replying xx",

How wrong was I as I've just found out. I'm waiting to see the oncologist but have just been told they are waiting for the results on oncotype. No one had ever mentioned this test to me but I know what it is now and am so worried. My head is all over and I'm convincing myself that the length of time waiting means the cancer will be growing again.",

I was asked whether I was using the aqueous cream to wash with and whether I also used it on the breast. I said I was and that also I used Holland and Barrett Aloe Vera 99 which certainly eased the area. The radiographer was adamant that I only wash with the aqueous and if the skin feels sore to put cold flannel. Whilst respecting her advice I am scared to use anything so would you be able to tell me what I should be doing especially as Christmas is coming up, I have a break, and really don't want to have breaks in my skin.
