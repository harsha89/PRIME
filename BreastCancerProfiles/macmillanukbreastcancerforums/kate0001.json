    "Content": "I have had some problems with sore breasts and felt some abnormal lumps ... Most importantly we have recently discovered that I could have a strong genetic strand. my grandma had it 4 times until she passed away. Now my mum, after 11 months since her last test, has had an aggressive growth removed that has already spread to her central nodes. She is about to start very toxic chemo and then will have both booths removed, then radiotherapy and possibly her womb and ovaries(?) Removed.. So my last breast scan 18 months ago, showed 2 cysts, one in each breast. I have have an extra one in my left which could explain my discomfort..... They also found other lumps which they believe to be fibroadenomas. I had an ultrasound and mammogram but no fine needle aspiration. How can they tell what it is? My doctor refered me to a breast clinic brefore she shared my results but I have to wait for ages and was thinking I may get some advice on here...  Thanks ",
