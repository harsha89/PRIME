      "Content": "hi there, just wondered if any one knows what happens when your treatment is in Wales - we, fortunately, automatically get free prescriptions without filling in any forms but I didn't hear if that also coveres dental treatment and eye tests too - I too pay monthly for my contact lenses and tests so wonder if Ican claim some back? Also went to dentist shortly after finished my chemo for a check up and they knew I had just finished chemo but still paid.... Any answers gratefully received - did ring my bcn but they are off sick until monday!!!! thanks everyone Fiona",

I found the second and third treatments of Tax not as bad as the first even without reducing the dosage but for me it was def worse than the FEC - but I had been told to expect that - the good thing was that I wasn't sick with it - in fact I forgot to take the antisickness tablets! I too got the mouthwash and also some medicine for suspected thrush in mouth. It is def worth telling them your syptoms and see what they can give you to relieve them - it helps! Don't try to do too much either and listen to your body. It does get better towards end of the cycle - you are nearly there now - hang on in there! Fiona",

      "Content": "Hi Jen, Glad the weekend went ok and girls at least enjoyed the evening! At least there wasn't much tidying up to do later! The way that surgery is done here is that they only offered me a mascetomy and said that if I wanted to consider reconstruction that that was at least a year down the road. The last time I spoke with them they said it was one year after all treatment finished so guess that I am looking at this time next year? Think they will tell me about it in June so I have time to think about it. I was told they didn't like to do recon at same time as having radiotherapy can damage implants and change shape of breasts - have others out there found that? Having read on this site about different recons - and watching news about implant problems not sure how I feeling about it now - didn't realise there were different ways of reconstruction - anyone know the different reasons that different people have different ones or is it more what is available in your area? Will check out the suggestions for wigs - I am really bad at colour and styles so guess that is why I went for an option that was so close to my original colour but maybe the time has come for a change! Got call from BC nurse today that my swim form is in so am now going to get a costume - any suggestions on where to look? Have details for Womanzone and Amoena and think will phone them tomorrow! Today's disaster was about getting new mobiles - we had ordered them over w/end as contracts are all coming to a close and daughter was ballistic that hers hadn't come today as expected (found out later that we were given wrong info by sales team and that it will come tomorrow!!!!) - she had been looking forward to it all day and that put her out of sorts big time after school - I very nearly walked out... need to learn to be more patient!!!! Well here is hoping that the phones come tomorrow and that it is a good day!!!! Take care - have a good last week before starting back at work - do you work full time? What do you do? Fiona (PS while we have questions that others can answer is there another way that we can keep in touch - read about others mentioning it but not sure how that works?",

      "Content": "Hi Jen, Other side effects were the really aching muscles in legs (but only really bad with the first tax). I used the paraetomal as they advised - only after I had taken my temperature to make sure I didn't get a false reading. To me my feet felt cold and so i had thick socks. hot water bottle and blanket on them to try and keep warm but when my daughter felt my feet there were like an oven!!! They are still cold although I have tended to suffer from cold hands and feet all my life! My big toe nails came off (apparently they take upto 18 months to grow back ) but think the others will remain! also all fingernails have lifted off - they are growing back now - looks more like i have chewed them a lot! also they are very ridged. Still find that because of the numbness I drop things more than normal! Still have no feeling under my arm (had all nodes removed too). Hair is growing back but too slowly for my liking - but then I am impatient! eyelashes and brows are getting there too. I did have 15 sessions of radiotherapy which finished Dec 31st! Skin went red but almost all disappeared now. I also still get tired and weepy. Still have to pace myself and can't do all the things that I used to do although am doing a lot more than I did during chemo/radio. My blood counts also dipped and ended up in hospital twice with neutrphenia - once the neutraphils were at zero! They said I had an infection both times (i was admitted with a high temp and only once there did theydo the blood counts) but never found the specific one! I also had to have blood transfusion after chemo as my white count was low and not really picking up - this helped on the energy front but not immediately! Feel more strength each day but not back to normal yet - whatever normal is! Did u have any other symptoms? Are you tamoxifen now? I have been on it for about 3 weeks and so far so good - although keep waking up in the night... hear soon, Fiona Forgot to say also had filgraton injections at home after my first stay in hospital but still ended up back in for a few days!",

      "Content": "Hi again! Does sound like it was really similar for us both! I had 3 out of 21 nodes affected and was borderline for radiotherapy but when pushed my oncologist said I could have it! I also tried the cold cap for the first two FEC but by the third too much had fallen out. The first time I had it, it wasn't fitted tight enough and also wasn't as cold as the second - the staff using it were not the normal ones for the first session so wondered if that made a difference. Also none of the staff in the unit seemed to think that it was worth using as with tax it would come out anyway but I spoke with chemo nurses in other units where they are using cold cap whilst on tax and it has been very effective so not sure what to make of it! Did you have one operation or two? When were you diagnosed? When did you start taking the tamoxifen, while you were still on radiotherapy? I take the tamoxifen at night as I read on this site that that sometimes stops some of the side effects as you are asleep! So far just problems with waking up in the middle of the night - but maybe that is because I am worrying about lots of other things now that life is 'getting back to normal'?!?!? I have never totally stopped work (it is a two minute walk away) and my employer is very flexible and I only work two mornings a week. So have gone in when I have felt able to go but now feel there are so many other things around the house that need my attention that I can't do too much - still go in two mornings but not until nearer 10 than 9! Still have problems picking things up because of numb fingers etc. I did have scans - to check for spread and for bone density I think. Seemed to come back clear with only one very small question mark on one of my lungs but the team didn't think it was anything to worry about. I seem to remember that they said i would have more scans after to see what has happened but no one has mentioned that yet! Also they were supposed to be monitoring bone density before and after chemo so guess they have to do another one for that at some point? Did you have scans too? By the way, forgot to ask you old you are? I am being treated in north wales so got a free wig too. Waiting for the prothesis so that I can go swimming! It is nice to have some one at similar stage - looked for people before but didn't find anyone who 'sounded' similar. Where are you being treated? I am in Wales. By the way - couldn't get the paragraphs to work like you did - guess I am doing something wrong! ok, have to bed now, so will check website again in the morning! take care Fiona",

      "Content": "Hi there - did just reply but my interent is on a time limit and when I went to post the reply then it crashed out!  So will try to write it again... Hope the party for Holly went well and didn't make you too tired.  I also have 2 children - girl nearly 13 and boy nearer 16 than 15 so doing GCSE's right now!  (I was 45 when diagnosed and now 46)THey have coped fairly well with everything - we have told them what is happening at each stage but they are older than yours.  She has been quite emotional at times and when at home likes to hang out with us!  He has punched the wall a few times but...  We told the school what was happening and they have looked out for them and as far as I know only had one time that my daughter couldn't cope.  It was great to have mobile phones especially while I was in hospital (ended up there on 4 occasions - twice with ops and twice admitted with high temp!)  as that helped her feel she could keep in touch with me when she needed too. Sounds like our exp is very similar - except I had to have mx as well as node clearance during second op which was in June 2011 and started chemo Aug 1st - easy to remember!  It was certainly great to have finished all treatments (apart from tamoxifen) last year- sounds good!!! My surgeons have advise to wait for a year after radio finished before having recon - not sure what I will do about it yet... will have to see what they say! I can't see what the problem would be if you wanted to take the tamox at night - after all mine says that if you miss one you can take it later although not too close to the next dose.  I started taking it at night parlty because of comments on this site and also because I used to be on the pill and always took that at night too.  Wish the tablets were labelled like the pill was as it would help me remember if I had taken it or not - think I still have chemo brain still!!!  Also if it was so important to take then think I should have started mine before- can a day or a few weeks really make a big difference to the whole scheme of things?  What do others think?  The stats my onc showed me implied that the tamoxifen was more effective than chemo - did you get to see any stats like that?  Not sure what will happen after these appts - if all clear whether I will have to go back after 6 months or a year - u any idea? I would say that the palm of my hands are slightly red and my feet similar but haven't noticed blotchiness - but then I am colourblind so don't always notice slight changes! I am also a born worrier although I did sleep well last night - only woke when the alarm went and that was set by mistake!  My mind was working overtime the day but at least it is not all the time!  Do you think u are not sleeping well because of the tamoxifen or because you are worrying - think it can be a side effect? I think that I will try to write down my worries and questions and then remember to ask when next see onc in April or when see surgeons in June - have to have mammo just before this so the results will be there when I see them.  I am not sure what will happen about having more scans - think it is one think I will try to ask! I do tend to worry about every ache and pain - maybe it will get easier over time? Where did you get your wigs?  Have you tried shopping online?  I have only the one wig and realise that while it looks like my hair used to, unless i wear it for another year at least it won't look very much like what my hair is like now - it was fairly long before so will take that long at least to grow.  Thought might ask the lady who gave me the wig if it can be cut shorter then the shock won't be so much when I take it off!  Checked with my BC nurse and she implied I only entitled to one free one but the info about the wig said they are only supposed to last 4-6 months and I have worn mine for 5 already!    My arm has been a bit sore but am trying to remember to do my exercises - they gave me different ones after my radiotherapy and am not that good at remembering to do them!!!  Numbness still there but think it is improving. Well think that I had better go - sorry u had to wait so long for a reply - hope you have had a good weekend! take care Fiona",

      "Content": "Hi there I started having numb finger tips while on FEC (which is not supposed to happen ) and then had 3 Tax.  About a month after the last treatment my nails started to lift off.  Currently have lost 7 fingernails and 2 toe nails too.  The rest of the finger nails after lifting and the toenails are quite white. Just wanted to know what advice people have about how best to treat them?  I wear plasters round the ones that are lifting as this stops me catching them on things and wear gloves for washing up and gardening etc.  Got some nail cream that was recommended  and use it on the nail beds a few times a day but wondered if others out there had some good tips? Also how long before they will grow back?  They are already partly grown but I am impatient!  (also about hair re-growth!!!) When I should my fingers to my nurse this week, she asked the question will they grow back - so not very confident in asking her for advice!! thanks in anticpation for answering! Fiona",

      "Content": "so pleased you all got such a good time at the Look Good, Feel Good event - we had one at our hospital and unfortunately (for me) don't think our goodies came to even £20 - had a facial and make over but unfortunately the lady doing mine (from a local college), didn't speak much english and didn't explain how she did any of it!  I had to ask her questions - it was hard work! Having said that it was still a good time (although it was an hours drive each way) - from the desciption every one else has given wonder if I should mention to someone  that it was not quite the same as others - feel it is letting the name down as you have all had such an amazing time - it was great to be pampered for an hour or so.  There were just a few us - think someone else didn't bother turning up - felt bad about for that. Has anyone else had a similar experience? Sorry to be a bit moany, am still pleased I went and it did help encourage me on the journey!",
