    "Content": "optimum HI everyone, i finished my first chemo 10 days ago, no problem so far, and i'm preparing to cut my hair in the next few days. I'm a planner and would like to hear any advice on eyebrows. At the moment i have very dark eyebrows and when they go it will be noticeable. I've heard there are \"false\" hairs that can be stuck on, that last a few weeks. Any suggestions other than drawing them on? hi optimum i had chemo in 2015 seems ages ago now.
