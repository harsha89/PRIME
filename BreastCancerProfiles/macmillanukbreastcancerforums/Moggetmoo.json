      "Content": "So far i think i have coped with the whole nightmare that is BC surprisingly well. But now the hair is starting to go and am maulting (?) more than the cat, i am taking it quite badly. Spent most of saturday morning in and out of the bathroom, and crying to myself in contemplation of losing the hair, which is looking more and more likely as the days go by. Am sick of feeling ok then being 'reminded' of the crap that life has dealt me. Sorry all, not having a good day... Hope everyone else is feeling more positive and happy today Sally x",

      "Content": "Hello Tessa, When are you trying the cold cap? I started chemo on Tuesday and tried the cap although it took them 3 attempts to get the right fit and it on the right way round!! It wasn't as bad as i thought it would be - wore a really big fleece and after 10 minutes my head had gone numb anyway. So am now waiting to see if it will work or not!! Have bought some headscarves though just in case... Hope it works for you Sally x",

      "Content": "Hi Jet I have been using baby shampoo so far, and still moulting badly - have never heard of chemo shampoo, where do you get it? Am only washing hair couple of times a week and it is short as had it cut before started chemo. May see if i can put up with trailing hair over the weekend and if not then think it will be clippered as it is driving me bananas - found a hair in my eye ??? yesterday and took ages to fish it out. ouch! Thanks for your comments Sally",

I am hoping that my hair will just thin and will not fall out....but my head has been feeling really sensitive so am wondering if this is the start. When have everyone else lost hair with FEC? Am i looking at going fully shaved this time next week????? Sal x",

      "Content": "Thankyou so much for your positive comments and for being so understanding. Still losing the hair big time, found a bald spot over my ear today and had to clear out the plug in the shower today to let the water out. Have cycle 2 tomorrow and now wondering whether to bother with the cold cap again and just let 'nature' take its course and let my hair go. Am thinking that maybe getting the clippers out will get it over and done with and let me get used to the baldness sooner rather than prolonging it???? See wig lady tomorrow - think may find out how long it will take to get one before i take the plunge and clipper it. I have a couple of scarves but they just make me look like a bean head - i really don't think that i will be mistaken for Demi Moore in GI Jane any time soon... Sally x",

Not having surgery until the new year - still have another 4 cycles of chemo to go. Take care and be strong - it's not always easy to do this i know! I have a mystical date somewhere in the future when i get the ' all clear' - though it seems so far away. Think of this as another hurdle you are getting over. Sally",
