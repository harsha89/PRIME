    "Content": "Hi - looking at all the posts here, seems employers all have different views.  I work in the public sector and since my operation in December 2015 I am still on reduced hours, but not fixed as I am still suffering side effects.  My employer allows we to work the hours I am comfortable with, so if I wake up and it's a good day I work my full hours.  Likewise, if I'm feeling not so good he allows me to travel to and from work avoiding the rush hour.  I also have the advantage of working from home on projects.  Good luck with sorting out you hours and feeling better soon.",
