    "Content": "This has touched such a nerve with me because the week before my first surgery (a bowel resection) we moved house! Although I loved the house when we bought it, I came \u2018home\u2019 and felt completely misplaced. I felt as though I had been put down in a place completely alien to me even though I had loved it and looked forward to moving in. I am coming to terms with it now 6 months later, but perhaps it was not the house. Perhaps it was the whole experience described in the poem. I am so pleased to read this and know that others have felt this way. It helps me realise that I am not going mad and I am not mentally unstable, I am just dealing with cancer!  Onward and upward! ",
