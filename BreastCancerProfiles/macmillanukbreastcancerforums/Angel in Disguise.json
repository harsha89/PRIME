I could not have watched it when I was ill either, but as you say, informative. Wishing you and your husband the very best",

      "Content": "I watched the programme. Think it was interesting to see a guy with breast cancer as a lot of people don't realise that men can get it. Was good to see the lady with breast cancer. The fact she has already survived 20 years will be a source of comfort to a lot of people. Great to see new drugs going to trial too. When I first saw Sally, I thought she did not look a well lady. Then discovered she had NHL, which is what I have had. Obviously it was tragic that she died, particularly as she had children. I was not upset by the programme, as Sally had already managed 10 years with the disease and that gives hope to the rest of us in the early days. She was very brave to be filmed. One day her family will understand how she has helped others like me, not only by being filmed but also advancing our knowledge on the disease. Will definitely watch next week. Well done to all the participants!",
