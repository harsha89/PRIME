We moved to our new house on 3 august (our second move in france) and so our friends here (all except one i have known 20 years) are new. Someone calls every day, people drop in and take my dog out, the freezer is full of soup and frozen meals, on thursday and friday different people came and washed up and brought me lunch and collected prescriptions- the kindness is humbling. I think they might have done a secret rota? One of the men calls my OH every day to make sure he is OK.

I have been using Evonail on my nails which is transparent but black nail varnish just as good I'm told. I shaved my hair on day 10 as hair follicles were so painful, bone pain can be controlled with paracetamol and only used Tramadol once for stomach pain.

I found plain white bread ham sandwiches and ginger ale to be practically the only things that worked for me. The only good news is that by the end of the cycle the taste buds recover just in time for the next cycle. Someone also recommended using a straw to drink so that you don't actually taste anything, but your daughter needs to keep her fluid intake up so try everything. Cranberry juice also was OK and good for bladder health. Good luck and I'm sure other people will post more ideas",

In most of the anti screening this would probably fall into the leave it alone school of thought.  They operated and found IDC, HER2+, Grade 3.  I have subsequently had chemo, Heceptin, another operation to get clean margins and lymph node biopsy (all clear and so the op was not necessary but no other way to be sure) and will now have 33 sessions of radiotherapy.  Am I the 1:1,000 that has benefited from the screening process?  Had I not had the operation with grade 3, HER2+ cancer I am pretty sure I would be looking at a quick advancement of the disease, lymph and vascular invasion and mets (I may have all of this anyway).  Had I not had the mammogram the micro-calcifications would not have been spotted since I did not have a palpable tumour, no action would have been taken meanwhile the cancer would have probably spread due to it's aggressive nature.  I do understand your argument re over use of screening, over treatment etc but have always thought how would I feel if I was that 1 person for whom it actually makes a difference?  Please correct me if I am wrong, but I think ironically I am that person.  How do I feel? grateful that they found it before it had spread further, grateful at the speed of the reaction of the doctors and the availability of treatment/drugs and yet still worried about my long term prognosis due to the HER2+ Grade 3 element.  Carol",

Sascha told me to go to the doctor, which I did and I had an infection and was put in hospital. Tax is bloody terrible but for me it was only 3 months of feeling like you do now - it seems like a lifetime but you will get through it. I started doing 4 hourly paracetamol, 4 hourly ibuprofen (something every 2 hours) and Tramadol on the really bad days. My Onc said this is supposed to cure you not kill you so if you need extra meds to get through it ask the doctor. My dear friend everything you have said about Tax is true and I would like to know who thought it would be a good idea to chop yew trees into bits to make the stuff? But it works, hold onto that thought it actually work, hard to believe though that is. I said to my husband that I look in the mirror and just see an older, uglier, balder version of me! He said he thought I looked the same but without hair! I watched old b/w movies on YouTube - night to remember, it's a wonderful life, Dirk Bogarde, jimmy Stewart, mike Todd, lots of wing commanders and jolly women, sheer escapism but really worked for me and no-one gets cancer ever!

Herceptin is considered to be more effective if given with chemo (although it is a relatively new thing to give Herceptin to early stage people like us so there is still a lot of research going on). That maybe why it is the TAC chemo we have been given? Also this is called the belt and braces approach that they throw everything at it because of the HER2+. I didnt even have a tumour just a 6mm micro invasion - they didnt even do the sentinal lobe biopsy because they were so sure it was DCIS - i have that to look forward to at next op as they didnt get clear margins.

The plan is first a portocath, then 4 x Taxotere with E  starting on 3 September and Herceptin for a year.  MRI on both breasts after 3rd Chemo and then depending on the results another lumpectomy or mx with the SNB - then finally rads for 30 days.I suppose if the node are affected thy will also then have to do node clearance? He also gave me prescriptions for all the drugs under the sun to counter the side effects; gel for my nails; a wig prescription and a taxi prescription (free to all appointments).  I am seeing the psychologist on Friday. As some of you ladies know I am in France so it's interesting for me to compare the treatment of BC here to the UK where most of you are and Spain where I used to live and where I know Sascha is not at all happy. I don't remember anybody who only had 4 sessions of chemo - it scared me a bit but he assured me it was all I needed.  So, now I'm worried I need more Chemo? I seem to have turned a corner in my attitude to my BC :) Isn't it strange, I have exactly what I had last week but now I have my treatment plan I no longer cry, google or think about BC 20 hours a day - I even sleep through the night.  Carol            ",

      "Content": "Hi Lola, if you are having your treatment in France do get in touch with the lovely ladies at Cancer Support France they can tell you what to expect in your local hospital. If it is anything like mine it was like a 5* hotel but with no jacuzzi or bar. A nurse came to help me shower and wash my back every morning and then I had constant attention until another nurse came to give me a back massage at 9pm. The food the day of the op and day before was super bland but by the second day it was duck breast with dauphie potatoes! I wore front buttoning pjs and that helped me a lot (I was having second lumpectomy and 7 nodes out) and had a drain which they actually took out before I went home, they don't like to send you home with drains at my hospital. In the old days there was a period of convalescence after an operation and to a certain degree this still applies in France. As you rightly said they don't do pain so I was topped up with doliprane and didn't need anything else until I got Seroma and cording. I should have kept going with the exercises but couldn't because of the Seroma. I took my iPad and watched UK tv on filmon live through wifi in the hospital google filmonlive Bonne Chance with your op and do feel free to pm me if you want to talk about French things. Carol",

My toe nails have done even better, I think because I they only get washed once a day whereas I am constantly washing my hands. Toenails are perfect, no different to how they were before Tax.

The first TAX was by far the worst, I was depressed and weepy and didn't get off the sofa for about 14 days. My friend came over and offered to wash my hair but I couldn't stand up. I didn't have any of your other problems so please don't beat yourself up TAX does nasty things to both body and brain. The good news is that it does get easier but the side effects seemed to change with each session - this time nose is sore and bleeding all the time, hands sore and I am tired.

Made me cups of tea when I was too ill to get into the kitchen. I'm sure there are gifts that she would appreciate but you just being there, sitting with her and listening is better than any gift.

My hospital has a research dept on food and environmental factors in breast cancer. The hospital is called the Leon Berard Centre and on the web site (also in English) there is a section on food and diet. But actually the main thing they seem to push is at least 30 mins exercise a day and keeping a good weight with low fat/muscle ratio. I am taking my girls out for an hour a day (not sure about today though due to torrential rain and low temp) but the puppy keeps jumping in the lake and swimming after the ducks amd am worried she will catch cold!

I am grade 3 HER2+ IDC. - her2 positive and soya. I was told to avoid soya as there are current studies into Her2+ breast cancer and soya not being a good thing. The are only studies but indications are that soya could actually encourage HER2+ cancer. Just so you know, I have basically given up red meat, milk products, sugar, alcohol and cakes and biscuits since being diagnosed...... - there are no studies that indicate cows milk is bad for cancer patients quite the opposite you need the calcium. 3 portions of milk products a day recommended - they do not recommend that you stop eating red meat - quite the opposite but you need to mix it up with chicken, eggs and fish -Regional, seasonal fruit and veg only and 5 portions a day, every day. She said no need to juice or eat massive amounts of broccoli (as I have been doing) . You should try and only eat food in season and wherever possible from the region where you live. - sugar in moderation - food should be a pleasure - wine no more than one glass a day They recommend a balanced diet with 5 portions of fruit and veg a day BUT exercise is imperative every day, it is the only thing actually proven to help avoid reoccurance of breast cancer. So, that's news to me! I would just stress that this was information given to me asking specifically about HER2+ cancer. But does explain why they just gave me duck breast and chocolate mousse for lunch! Carol",

You will always find care and support and people willing to listen to you. We have all googled, we all regret it, my advice would be do not use any other web page except macmillan until you have your treatment plan. My diagnosis changed everytime i saw a doctor until i started chemo. Due to over googling i went into the meeting withe the oncologist thinking i had a 50% 5 year survival chance (turns out it is 95%). Any statistics you see online are already out of date - a person who is now 10 years disease free was treated 10 years ago and the treatments have changed a lot since then. The waiting is the worst part by far but once you start it does actually get better. And finally, when friends and family offer help accept it, this was hard for me to do but as i am now in the chemo stage it is such a relief when someone comes over with a meal, fills up the freezer, takes out my dogs, does the supermarket run or as happened this week somene came to do the ironing! So, welcome- did i mention dont google? Carol",

I am sorry for what you are going through, but everyone here will tell you the waiting is the worst part of the whole thing. Try not to google, we have all done it and we all regret it. I became an expert on something that I didn't even have. Once you have the diagnosis, you will know what is ahead and we will all be here to support you, someone here will have been through something similar and will be able to help you. In my case they did the lumpectomy without the node biopsy 4 months ago and now I have to have another op and the node biopsy in December ( underestimation of the disease), but I will get through it as you will with the support of friends and family and the wonderful women on this site.

      "Content": "Sasha, All the statistics show that cancer treat for BC in Spain is the best in Europe but it is the aftercare you are sadly lacking. There is a precedent in the European health care system that if you require planned medical treatment that is not available in your country you /your doctor can apply to other member states for you to receive that treatment. This has to be approved by your health authority. If you google access planned treatment member states it's all there. Since psychiatric care in English is not available to you and it is part of planned medical care for breast cancer patients you should be entitled to have that in the UK, ditto reconstruction. People from the UK who need planned non urgent surgery frequently come to France where there are no waiting lists. You do need help and you need it in English. If they won't approve England ask to come to France. As you know I didn't have to have a mx in the end but was clearly told if I had one I would not have reconstruction for 18 months-2 years because of the rads so, if that is the same in your case, you could apply to have the reconstruction done here in France or in the UK. This refers to planned medical treatment not the emergency only treatment as covered by the old E11. Sascha, all of us on this board know how cancer takes something away from us - bits of our bodies, the chemo takes your hair and your memory, for many of us it takes our employment and in my case that very much defined who I was. By taking away the possibility to work and earn money some of us find ourselves in hard times, some people have divorced because their partners couldn't take it. What I am trying to say is that people might not be suffering exactly what you are going through, but they are still going through shit that no amount of breast cancer nurses can sort out. We all try to help one another through this board and you above all people know that because you have helped me countless times over the past 8 months. The friends we have here now are really doing their best for you and I agree you have to get yourself back to the UK, what if you just turned up at an accident and emergency dept in London saying you are suicidal wouldn't they have to section you under the mental health act? It might be worth doing just that? Lots of love to you Carol",

The only way I will know is if I get mets in the future or I don't. So what kind of future is that? Just waiting to see if it comes back? I was wondering if it is a kind of phase we are going through, we're not worrying about the treatment so much now, so we move on (as it were) to worrying about the future? Perhaps with time it gets better? I had an MRI scan last week, (which was clear) but event the radiologist said that after 3 sessions of chemo you would hope it would be clear (door, horse and bolted). Good news in so far as I haven't any visible time bombs ticking in either breast, not including DCIS which I may still have in the left side but doesn't show on an MRI? - op 13th December to have another go at clear margins. The girl I met with lobular was actually from Jersey, she had to got to Southampton for her rads and was in a hotel for 6 weeks, as there is no rads machine on Jersey. Which brings me onto the hair issue. You have never heard me going on about my hair (I had my husband shave it off when it was falling like snow) I didn't even cry and frequently go without my wig, which I hate. But when the girl from Jersey's hair grew back it was wirey (she says like Tom Jones) mine is starting to grow back ( it didn't all go I had a sort of black Velcro stubble since it was shaved) but now I have grey, wirey Tom Jones hair coming through! When I started this nightmare, I had long straight bottle blonde hair, which apparently I can't dye my hair again post cancer treatment. So, every time I look in the mirror I see a complete stranger, disguised an an older, uglier version of me. I don't have the mx scars, but 2 x lumpectomy ain't a good look plus 2 x scars from the portocath for good luck. I was told 'It may be curly when it grows back' and had quite come around to having Boticelli curls BUT Tom Jones (and that is Tom Jones as he is now, not in his 60's hey day). My Mother-in-law was here last week she did make a valid point that one day Cancer may well just be a chronic illness (and gave the example of Aids, malaria, etc all of which used to kill but now can be treated) I hope it's in my lifetime.

Frankly, if it saves one life its worth it, young women respond to different things - who ever thought Jade Goody would be a role model for young women and cancer screening?

Spanish people are pretty regimented in their complaints proceedure so you will need the correct form. You could find out from the internet the name of the director of the hospital and copy him ( its usually a man and is a political appointment so they will not want you complaining either - bad for the image).

      "Content": "As I am now about half way through my treatment I just thought I would add my 2\u20ac worth of comment. I am having my treatment in France, where I live. The health service is massively funded (there are 20 specialist cancer centers) but I have been offered and great fully accepted the treatment recommended by my Onc which is pretty much the same as you would get in the UK. I have had 1 x lumpectomy (I will have second op in December as they did not get all the DCIS and a SNB) 4 x TAC and 18 Herceptin. I have had all the scans you would expect including an MRI yesterday with NOTHING on it YAY! My point is that the conventional treatment is global conventional treatment and in France where the health service has huge budgets, the treatment is no different to that you will be offered in the UK. Here there is separate funding for new drugs and if any become available the doctors can offer them to patients without having to worry about the financial implications ( the first woman to get Herceptin in France in 1998 was given it in my hospital and she still comes back for her annual check up). So, even in this utopian health service there is nothing different on offer to what the NHS is offering you - because what is currently available is the best there is at present. It may change in the next few years but I would suggest you take the conventional route it is tried and tested. Carol",

I still do think it daily, how did I end up like this? 6 months ago I had a biopsy and it has been basically downhill from there. I suppose this is what most people go through? Lack of sleep doesn't help and TAX does screw with both your body and brain and keeps doing its evil job even after you finish. I have been crying all day and am now in bed and I had my last TAX on 5th November. I think everything you are feeling I also feel so I am supposing this is par for the breast cancer course - I had no idea it would be this bad. I don't have mets as far as they know, but grade 3 HER2+ and they haven't yet got it all, I have a meeting for the results of the last op on Friday. I am in agony with the Seroma which is back 2 days after it was last drained and basically can't move my arm cos it just makes it worse. A year ago I was MD of a fashion brand, I am now useless, I can't even put a log on the fire, the lights on the tree or go Christmas shopping (can't lift, raise arms etc etc). This is me cheering you up by the way,.... It's gone a bit wrong. What I mean to say is that I think this is what it's like, my neighbour is a five year survivor and she tells me she went through all of this exactly like us. We just have to hope it gets better soon. To add insult to injury, today all my 'stubble' fell out of my head I had a bath and it was floating on the surface like when my husband shaves (good old TAX) so am now left with grey fuzz, great for Christmas, if they make me wear a hat from the crackers I'll look like a novelty egg. So, my dear friend, we can. Only hope it will get better soon. Carol",

But if you can get some, drink it really cold and I found taste was fine and helped me get more fluids. Fluid is not a problem for me now now as have it flowing with gay abandon into my armpit (following lymph removal) and had it siphoned off twice in 5 days (lovely!).

We moved to France in December and in May had annual mammogram, which showed microcalcifications, biopsy showed DCIS. I had lumpectomy which showed 6mm of invasive HER2+ cancer. I am now awaiting 2nd lumpectomy and have finished chemo, I am receiving Herceptin. Had I not had the mammogram the calcification a would not have been discovered, HER2+ is aggressive and I could well have had a different outcome. Perhaps the fact that the articles are from the USA where the $ very much drives the health service and women do not have access to treatment if they can't pay for it is relevant? Carol",

They were so sure I had in-situ they didn't do a node biopsy, so now I have to have some nodes removed (sentinel node biopsy useless after 4x chemo). There is nothing much I can say to you except that I am really sorry you are going through this and that we are all here for you.

I am working on the premise that it can't be worse than TAC and I got through that OK and to make you feel very happy indeed, be glad you don't live in France I am having 33 sessions! IDC 6mm grade 3 her2+++ and no nodes involved - I think they plan to blow any remaining cells into outer space with 25 normal sessions and 8 boosters. Carol",

      "Content": "Hi Jelly, I couldn't ever get pregnant due to hormone problems associated with my thyroid. I realy do know how you are feeling but I now consider this was a) my destiny and b) the best thing that ever happened to me. Why? Because 6 years ago we adopted our son, he celebrates his 11th birthday today and he is the light of our lives. Had I been able to have my children the 'normal' way then this boy who is loving, funny, beautiful, academically brilliant and a fantastic musician and sportsman would have had a very different life and I cannot imagine that I could love any child more than I love him. So, there may well be a chance for you to have children in the future - you may not carry them in your tummy but that doesn't mean you can't carry them in your heart. There are thousands of children in the world who need love and a good home (and many in the UK who need fostering or adopting) the adoption regulations are changing for the better in the UK due to an initiative from Michael Grove (himself adopted). I understand from a friend in the UK in the adoption world that one of the most difficult groups of children to place in foster homes are siblings and that long terme foster care (that is for children who do not go back to their parents but who cannot be formally adopted) is in short supply. Also, my son was just about 5 when he came to us, people asked me don't you want a baby? I said no, I want a child of my own . Here's a little gem from this morning \"Mummy do you realise that when you speak French and Spanish you have the same accent?\" Me, \"that's impossible\" Him \"It's true, you have an English accent\" (falls over laughing) - did I mention he is alo tri-lingual? I am one very, very proud Mummy :). A hug to you, Carol",

I bought some for our Mac that has integral mike and they work just fine. It's a grieving process you are going through for what you have had taken away from you both and you need help, don't let this mike thing be another obstacle to you getting someone to talk to. You have to keep plugging away to find someone who can help you get through this. In the meantime you know that you have your friends here who are always ready to help if we can. Lots of love Carol",

I had my mammogram with some suspicious calcifications in MAY and still don't know if I need a mx or full lymph node clearance. So, my goal posts keep being moved all over the place like yours from \"DCIS lumpectomy + rads\" to \"I'm so sorry\" (that was the surgeon) IDC, grade 3, her2+ chemo, herceptin, another op and partial lymph node clearance. It is both frustrating and bewildering -part of me thinks \"these people are experts how can they not know what is wrong with me\" to \"they won't know until the results come backin 15 days because without the lab results it's just guess work\" It's just a case of having to wait, do what they say and hope for the best. Not ideal, but at least the chemo is over and that is the worst bit. The only consolation is that nobody is expecting a Christmas card from me this year! Carol",

The onc gave me a prescription for Evonail to paint on my finger and toenails and the surrounding skin each morning which i have religiously done. It is a clear liquid in nail varnish size bottle but doesnt smell at all. Anyway, 13 days post first Tax and my nails have never been better. All strong, good colour with no discolouration or ridges at all. Lily the puppy ate the box but it is made in france by EVAUX LAbs. It protects the nails from ultraviolet - in the good old day just after the chemo when i could still walk the dogs i did wear gloves (paranoia about losing nails) but my friend recommended i just see if the Evonail works and it does seem to. It wasnt covered by the social security so i paid 23\u20ac for it, so far so good. Carol",
