      "Content": "Hi Gill, Like you iam having problems with soreness/tenderness in my left arm. I had an operation and 31 lymph nodes removed on my right side, ive had 3 fec treatments all done in the left arm and from wrist to elbow it is very sore indeed.  As you say the drugs must be affecting the veins to cause this. My right arm though is very sore when fully extended and im wondering if  physiotherapy would help. Im hoping the soreness in the veins on the left will go when fec is completed,  other than gently massaging the left arm im not sure what else we can do, so I'll be very keen to hear what replies may come. I hope gill you are managing to cope with fec, im only just managing, just have to keep reminding myself its all going to be worthwhile!  You take good care, Kay",

      "Content": "Hi Gill,  many thanks for your message.  I understand your points and really everything is and will be bearable when you think about the whole situation. My family and friends are fab too, couldn't ask for better. I just wish they didnt have to be, sometimes....both of my arms really hurt and I do massage them to try and alleviate pain, my right arm will not extend without pain and I'm hoping this will get better, I've had 31 lymph nodes removed 17 were infected so im thinking it takes time for nerve endings to heal.  Iam really down at the moment I've caught a cold since Xmas and it will not go away, the coughing is the worst I've ever had in my life, I can't sleep at night it's been at least 5 nights no sleep so far, my temp is just within the bounds so I've been drinking lemsips, taking nurofen, lozenges nothings working so I'm nothing but a moaner!!! Just reading this back makes me sound as if im a perpetual whinger!! But in reality I'm getting a bit depressed with this cough and yet trying to stay  strong for my family ( putting on a brave face really)  this is just the pits!  I'm really hoping things will improve for my 4th fec on 14th.   So reassuring to read others feelings and experiences..all my love to you gill, my cancer is grade 3 too, I've had a WLE and lymph removal (31). Just on this journey now as its been described to me and dealing with the bald head and all the issues with treatment etc, could easily jump to another journey.. but onwards and upwards as you say, keep going. Going to try my best and sleep now without waking everyone!  Lots of hugs and all my warmest of wishes to you xxx",
