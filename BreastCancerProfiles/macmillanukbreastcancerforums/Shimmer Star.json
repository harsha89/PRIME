      "Content": "Thank you so much for your lovely response - it really brightened my day yesterday and I feel a lot better today. I think you're right - with the right support and time passing I'm sure I'll come to accept the changes.I know the end is in sight and I think I've just got to get through this and then I'll feel normal again - normalcy has been what's kept me going but sometimes that can be so hard to accomplish whilst on chemo! My partner's playing a gig today so I'm going to that which again helps me feel normal. Thank you for your support and positivity - it goes a long way with me :-) Holly xxxx",

      "Content": "I haven't posted here in a while but am having a particularly bad day with how I feel about my body. I'm 30 and had a mastectomy and reconstruction in November last year and despite the trauma of it all I was pleased enough with the results and felt satisfied with how the breasts matched despite the loss of my nipple which I found very traumatising. However, since radiotherapy it has shrunk and tightened that side - so that now they're really uneven and it really upset me. I know I can have surgery on the other side to make it match but it scares me as 1.)  I don't know what surgery would help 2.) I don't know if it would affect sensation which I miss on the affected side and 3.) I don't know if I'll feel emotionally better after it. I finish chemo at the beginning of August so I'll be able to see the surgeon after that and will able to reschedule my surgery - but I am so sick of the waiting and because I'm on chemo I can't work or attend uni as I was doing before - and even though I'm keeping my mind busy I feel like I'm just waiting - that life has no meaning. Thank you for reading - it would be nice to have some success stories of feeling like this but coming through it - I know I've done well but some days make me feel worthless and horrible and I feel like I can't go them alone.

      "Content": "Hi Jan,  Thank you so much for your response - it\u2019s really great to hear that your surgical outcome is so good. I do have a very capable surgeon and I guess I just need to be patient - it will look better in time. Did you have a mastoplexy? And do you have less sensation than before? As that\u2019s another fear of mine - right boob is really numb and I\u2019d like to keep sensation in the other one if I can - but symmetry is most important to me - if I have to lose sensation to look like me again then I\u2019ll take it.  I actually had my op at the same time! Feels like so long ago and you\u2019re right - I am strong and I\u2019ve been through a lot so I can get through this too. Thank you for your support and for sharing - it gives me hope that I need right now. Holly xxxx",
