      "Content": "Hi , It is a year tomorrow (18th) since I heard those life changing words \" you have breast cancer\" I guess I was lucky that mine was early stage IDC cancer so no chemo but 3 weeks of rads and Tamoxifen , scored 11 on oncotype test. My problem is I have lost my VA VA VOOOM,so I have been looking for healthy alternatives and I came across Maca root capsules which I have ordered from amazon along with some Panax ginseng, the reviews are really good for women with menopause, PMT, low libido etc. Has anyone any advice or using some other supplements to bring back your sex drive, and is it ok to use these as I was estrogen positive.    ",

Anyone in the same boat and if so what results from it , I had 23mm grade 2 removed , lymph nodes clear, and also clear margins, ER + HER2 negative. Feeling fed up",
