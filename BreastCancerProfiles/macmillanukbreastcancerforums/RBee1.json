      "Content": "The epirubicin obliterates your hair - along with the cancer. I did cold cap two times. Cut my long hair into a bob night before first chemo by chemo 2 i had a friar tuck hairdo going on. I didnt bother for chemo 3 and it takes an hour off the treatment process. I wear a little cotton cap so it still looks like i have hair. I was really inspired by the ladies on this site who didnt use the cold cap and shaved their heads.  i am hanging onto my bits of hair but as chemo goes on, the hair issue seems a non-issue. As its cold, its the best time of the year to wear the selection of hats i bought pre-chemo.  Take care and best wishes x",

I lost my 25!! year old burmese cat and straight after my mum (with breast c) still not got over it all. Try to think and stay positive for your health. Thinking of you xxxx",

He is away in Edinburgh, Aberdeen Dublin and Plymouth for my remaining chemos and i am relying on my friends for help and support. You concentrate on getting better and taking joy in what keeps your morale up. You are not alone and your husband may reveal his true feelings about your health when you least expect it. Ignore anyone who says the wrong thing - focus on being well and beating the cancer xx ",

I can't even begin to imagine LIVING on it! But LIVING is my main interest now, I want to live and enjoy life and although my job was exciting, fast paced and generally fun, I can't hide behind a desk any longer. Scary...yes, but not as scary as what we ladies have faced, so am going to brace myself and....something always turns up. I have 5 months to sort my act out and quite unexpectedly, I have just started writing a short eccentric children's book, the first three chapters just flowed! You never know!  Looking into the New Year with a heart full of hope (oh...and  2 lucky dips!) X",

I have a 1cm tumour on my liver...okay not the best news anyone wants to hear but there are lots of ways to deal with it: initially chemo or radio, an operation to remove that part if possible - depending where problem is. My consultant said the tumour could also be lasered or another method is frozen so it causes no further problem. The liver is an amazing organ too, it has the power to regenerate. Wait for your results before panicking and don't worry. I know that's easier said than done, but if you do have liver involvement there's a lot that can be done. Take care xx",
