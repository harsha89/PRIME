      "Content": "HI I have been reading several posts regarding the taking of anastrozole (which i have started taking within the last month) and thyroxine (which i have taken for the last 4-5 years. I have become convinced that the unpleasant symptoms of irregular heartbeat (fast,hard and uneven rhythm) i have been suffering from that started approximately a week to 10 days after I began the anastrozole are due to the combination of these two drugs. Does anyone have any information or experience or knowledge of a possible link here they could reassure me with? I am trying to cope with the horrible attacks which I get randomly on a daily basis (I have never before had any problems like this) and not to let it interfere with daily life but it's really hard not to let it win. I see my radiotherapy consultant next week (i have finished FEC-T chemo and 3 weeks of radiotherapy) and was advised to chat to him about it, but I always feel that they consider that most of us come under the same umbrella of symptoms and statistics prove that you are normal, but surely everyone is different and we all react differently to drugs? thanks for listening to me waffle on!

      "Content": "Hi Binny Sorry you've been suffering with the flu I hope you are better now. I just had my flu shot so I hope it works!   thanks for the info regarding thyroxine/hormone therapies. I keep saying to whoever will listen (!!) that my thyroxine doesn't seem to like this new hormone tablet! I think that we mere mortals that have first hand experience of taking certain drugs can pretty much figure out when things aren't going right!!   I see my radiotherapy consultant this afternoon (I finished 3 weeks radio on August 21st) and my GP advised me to have a chat about these side effects so wish me luck  with that one!!   Any positive feedback from him will be gratefully received and I will post any useful information he may offer me later this week.   Onwards and upwards!!

I had made a note to myself to ring the MacMillan nurses with my concerns so after I speak to my radiotherapy consultant this after noon I will hopefully have more knowledge to be going on with!   I  will be forever grateful for the MacMillan group and all of you who help and advise - I would be in a right pickle if I hadn't picked up the phone back in October 2012 when  I was diagnosed the help and advice has been outstanding and 1st class!!   cheers.

      "Content": "Hi all, I have just seen this discussion and wow! I can't believe that I feel exactly the same, it could have been me that wrote your post! I finished chemo/rads just over a year ago and started Anastrozole soon after. That's when it all began to go so wrong for me! Within 2 weeks of taking the hormone tablets I was experiencing irregular heartbeats, the odd dizzy spell, and slight breathlessness. My GP did ECG and referred me to a Cardiologist (which took over 6 months to get the appt!). He said if it got worse go straight to A&E, which I did soon after. They did more ECG's, Echocardiogram, and I had to wear a monitor and stay overnight. I felt like they weren't listening to me at all  I said I have never in my life been bothered by anything to do with my heart, it all started after treatment for breast cancer, but all they did was give me Bisoprolol (beta blocker) and refer me back to my GP. Since then I have had 2 more heart monitors ( a 24 hr and a 48 hr one), another ECG and a referral to the Warfarin clinic, which thankfully I refused to take as I knew it wasn't needed. I had my letter at the weekend from the Heart clinic saying that they are discharging me and that I do not have Atrial Fibrillation (which I had already been told!) but they detected Ventricular/Supraventricular Ectopic Beats and to continue with the medication. Along with extreme tiredness, very bad aching bones, mood swings, feeling down, lack of appetite, the list goes on, I feel 100% NOT ME!!!! I see a Breast Onco nurse soon so I will be telling her everything and I really hope she can help me. I never ever felt anywhere near as rubbish as I do nowadays before all this began - even when I had a cold, flu or even when I had pneumonia a few years back I wasn't this bad. Cheers, Michele x",

      "Content": "Hi and well done to you for finally getting the flu jab (and having the gp's refund you. I had one last year free with the pharmacy where I work (Morrison's) and this year they wanted employess to pay 5.00 so I asked my gp (who is wonderful and cannot do enough for me!). I had mine last weekend and a checkup as well (they are very good to us!). It wasn't the fact that they now charge us 5.00 for the flu jab but there have been 6 of us working in a small supermarket that have cancer in various forms over the past year - so I would have thought it a must that we have the flu jab free of charge along with all other employees that qualify!! Take care and all the best! Michele x  ",

      "Content": "Hi again mollydog, I have just seen your post and thought this might help in some way. I work for Morrison's 20 hours a week on Fish/Butchery (since 2004) and I love my job and all my colleagues. When I was diagnosed last 0ctober 12th everyone couldn't have been more supportive (especially as 5 other colleagues have/had cancer in the last 2 years). Employers have to comply with the Equality/Discrimination act in regards to time off for cancer treatment. If your employer has a sickpay scheme all the better. I finished work last November 12th and my 1st operation was November 13th (that date again!) followed by another on December 17th followed by chemo on Feb 13th (spooky this date!) for 6 months followed by radiotherapy on August 1st for 3 weeks followed by the start of Hormone therapy on August 28th. I have been off work all this time and my main worry has been money (or lack of it!). After my company sick pay ran out I was on SSP for 28 weeks and then I had to apply to Job Centre Plus to start receiving Employment Support Allowance which I have had since the end of May - to keep receiving this you have to send on the original of your most recent fit note each time you get one. The best advice is to speak to a Macmillan benefits advisor who were my saviours! and also I applied for a Macmillan grant for which I was very grateful. I never in a million year ever thought I would be accepting grants/benefits etc from anyone but in our situation it's not anything to be ashamed of it's a case of survival in tough times which we will come through! I also have 3 weeks holiday accrued from this year that I will be able to book when I return to work - they have been brilliant throughout and I have always made an effort to pop into work and speak not only to my workmates but also Personnel/Management and keep them in the loop as to how things are going and I have seen our Company Nurse twice so they can be assured everything is going according to plan most of the time!  Always try to remember that circumstances we find ourselves in are not of our own making and we are not in control a lot of the time and have to rely on others to see us through even if we are stubborn and independent!! Please accept these ((((hugs)))) for you and your husband and if you want to chat then feel free to friend request me anytime. Michele xx",

      "Content": "Hi Pauline, so nice to put a name to your posts! I consider myself very lucky then that my employers are being good to all of us that are off work due to cancer treatments. I wouldn't leave my job unless they start to question the fact that I have been away too long! I had the choice on chemo but not radio so I decided to have it so I wouldn't be in the situation where I wish that I had had it later on! I don't know why, but when it came to the hair loss I was remarkably accepting of it all and knowing that I would probably lose it ( I had very long hair down my back!) I brushed it vigorously every day and helped it all come out quicker (the birds in my garden appreciated the hair I threw out for their nests!!!). I had a very nice hairdresser recommended in my area who helped with a wig (which I wore throughout chemo then when the weather warmed up I haven't worn it since only scarves) and when I get a long enough growth of new hair she will advise me what to do with it regards cut and highlights!! Yes I take Bisoprolol now but only since starting the Anastrozole so I have that to take for at least the next year my GP told me! It did not interfere with the treatment because I didn't take it during any of the chemo or radio. I have accepted the friend request so please feel free to chat anytime - I am still trying to work out how the different sections of this online thing works!! Have a lovely day both of you!

      "Content": "Hi Tracy (and all the others who have replied to you with similar), I also feel like you do especially within the last 4-6 weeks and hadn't a clue as to why. I used to think that everyone around me could only see the chirpy silly funny old me (which is a natural camoflauge against sadness that I do really well!) but inside I was totally short-circuited and nothing made any sense to me! But I have been through 2 ops, 6 months Chemo, 3 weeks Radiotherapy, 2 stays in hospital for infections, countless prodding,poking,insertions(!),3-4 hospital/GP/Nurse visits a month, and I am now starting a 5 year Hormone treatment (Anastrozole/Bisoprolol(for irregular heartbeats)and several more visits to see Consultants/GP's! So I guess all the feelings that we have to contend with all make perfect sense at the end of the day and staying positive (I hear this a lot!) is an emotion we have to call upon in times like this! I think I am feeling these sad thoughts lately because I was diagnosed with B/C a year ago yesterday (October 12th 2013) but also 2 days previous (October 10th 2013) we lost our beautiful girl, a collie cross Susie from Addison's Disease (which is also a condition that we can die from if not diagnosed in time) and the day I found out my results I was uncontrollably sobbing in the B/B nurses office and my husband had to explain that I was crying for my dog because she was always there for me and she wasn't there when I needed her most  and I think about her every single day - am I being silly for feeling so heartbroken? Then the following week my father-in-law was told he had Lung cancer and he passed away on November 9th so I guess it's that time of year when all these anniversaries are upon us. I am waffling on and on but you know what - once I start typing I can't stop and everything that's in your head comes tumbling out at once! Thank you for letting me empty it all out on you guys it means a lot! Michele xxx  :):)  ",

      "Content": "Hi mollydog, Thank you for your reply to my waffling text! I am very sorry that your husband is unwell I do hope in the circumstances you are both holding up okay and supporting each other. I do have 2 other dogs, one is 8 1/2 and the other is actually 9 today! I had my 6 cycles of chemo starting on Feb 13th (of all dates!) and finished at the end of June (I had the last cycle postponed for a week to recover from an MRSA infection! Then I had 3 weeks of radiotherapy from Aug 1st-21st followed by the Anastrozole which I started taking at the end of August. The heart palpitations/irregular heartbeat began about 7-10 days later and began to affect everday life so I went to my GP. He said my blood pressure was high (it's normal now) and did a heart trace later that day. Then 2 days later I was in hospital when they persisted and I stayed overnight hooked to a monitor and that is when they prescribed the Bisoprolol and I have to take it alongside the Anastrozole for at least one year then my GP will decide if I have to take it for the duration of the 5 years I have to take the Anastrozole! Because I have never been bothered before by any heart hiccups one of the Oncologists has decided that they were triggered by the hormone tablets (and also the fact that I already take Thyroxine probably didn't help!). But hopefully things have now calmed down such a lot in the last couple of weeks that I only have to keep an eye on things until I see my GP before the 16th November (which is when my fit note ends) to decide if I am confident enough to return to work yet. At this moment in time I don't feel remotely like going back until I have at least a whole *good* week under my belt!! I was told that the chemo did not have any adverse effect on the heart nor did the radiotherapy which I was pleased about. When does your chemo start and what regime are you on? I can't believe I actually completed mine it feels like years ago - a bit like short term memory loss I sometimes forget what it was like!! I hope it goes well for you and listen and read all the things you are given in terms of helpful hints and being aware of any things you aren't sure about to contact your chemo unit! Look after each other and stay safe!  Michele xx",
