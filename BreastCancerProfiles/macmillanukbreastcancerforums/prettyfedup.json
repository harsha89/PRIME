The fact that brave rhyme with shave is a good marketing ploy but a very insensitive one. People objected last year so you think they would pull it  but it gets them lots of money so they don't care who gets hurt ",

There are other ways to raise money without using baldy kids and women. Trillions of money donated still no cure. They cant cure us because its such a money spinner for drug companies  Those adverts are horrible and unnecessary and upset me every time. You watch telly for pleasure and being reminded of your impending demise doesn't feel pleasurable. Joanie x",
