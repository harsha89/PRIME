My redness did not start until 2 days after my radiotherapy had finished but boy I was glad to have the cream, especially the R1. I have now finished and still have lots of sachets left so if anyone wants them, please contact me and I can post them out to you. Lorraine xx",

      "Content": "Hi Ladies I had a double mastectomy in October 2015 followed by radiotherapy in March 2016. I have to wait 9 months before I can have the expander implants removed and \"normal\" implants fitted. The trouble I am finding is the port on both sides are really starting to hurt and if I lay on my side asleep the pain wakes me up. Sometimes the pain is so sharp it takes a while to even move to a new sleeping position. I am so tired as I cannot recall the last time I had a full nights sleep and just wondered if anyone else is suffering with same problem? Also the sides of my boobs (and where they meet the arm pits) feel really tight and quite painful. Am sitting at work typing this almost crying as I am so tired and fed up its untrue. Hope to hear from someone who understands  xx",

      "Content": "Thank you for contacting me. My surgeon said he could remove the ports but could not guarantee that the implants then did not leak so I am trying my best to wait for the next operation. Do your ports not stick out of your skin? Mine are clearly visable and right on my bra line which makes them hurt more. What changed for you to wanting to rip them out to now not being bothered with them anymore? Has your body just got used to them or did they stop hurting? I am 10 months since my operation so am feeling that if they still hurt now they will always hurt. My surgeon also said I could keep these expanders in permanently but they are rock hard and hurt so am choosing to have the further op to have normal ones put in x",

      "Content": "I definitely agree and I think when I see the surgeon next I might say in future, he may wish to put the ports higher up so that at least someone will benefit from the pain I am in and hopefully will help the Hospital improve. They are permanent ones and at the time of the operation I was never told they would be removed 9 months after radiotherapy but am kind of happy that they will be as are still like two bricks under my skin. Thank you so much for replying I will try the pillow idea tonight x",

I did not want to go through the operations again in a few years time if the cancer did pop up in the other breast. I had the double mastectomy two Saturday's ago with inflatable implants and am very happy with the results. I needed peace of mind and felt removing both would increase my survivability which at the end of the day is all I care about. I am more than happy to answer any other questions you may have.

I really wish I'd used it last week when I couldn't sleep for days as I was in so much pain. I hope this advice helps at least one person out there xxx ",
