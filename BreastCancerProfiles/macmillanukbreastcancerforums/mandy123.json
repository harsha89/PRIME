      "Content": "Hi I have had same reactions. Well done for putting yourself first My immediate family sisters etc dropped me too I had to cope on my own/ very hard I decided to drop them too /I can not see myself as like them and I don't want to be like them and now I can not be near them as they and there actions are not part of me and I will not allow them to be. I went to college and retrained and now work with cancer patients myself.I also have met people who are like me now and feel good about who I am ,what I do. I pat myself on the back. Think carefully about who and what you want in your life.As we know it can be short make your life work and be good to you/for you. Ask yourself how and what makes me/happy.Dont give your life to someone else. Hope this helps Oh and join support groups to meet similar people and take part in events/activities,put yourself out there. Take care ",
