      "Content": "Hi Nikki im so sorry to  read about everything you are going through . When i read it  you reminded me so much of myself how i felt when going through  mine . i really feel for you hun but all i can say is try and stay positive its hard i very much know that .   On the 4th July 2017 i was diagnosed having a maglignant   neoplasm of major slivary gland had surgery and 5 weeks of radiotherapy  .i had to have the radiotherapy everyday apart from weekends . as i was finishing near enough my treatment i felt lump at side of my left breast .to make story short it ended up being cancerous ,had surgery took 2 lymph nodes out which were cancerous and advised to have a full lymph node removal .  they arranged another date for surgery for full lymph node removal  which they told me there were another 6 nodes affected so total of 8 nodes were cancerous .it was  September 2017 i found out i had breast cancer .i had chemotherapy and more radiotherapy  , i am now taking Tomoxifen for 10 years .and i  might be having Zoledronic acid  which is a bisphosphonate  in veinvia an infusion for 3 years   .6 infusions at approx 6 monthly intervals .have to have any dental work done first .so been referrred to hosp dentist .got appointment to see them tommorrow morning .I   wasnt to bad after the lymph node clearance bit tender . if you have radiotherapy just make sure you put plenty of E45   onyour breast area going to be treated ,it helps reduce redness , this is whot i was advised to do at Christies and it worked for me ,infact i had no redness .i just made sure i kept putting plenty on .  Chemo was bit of a pain as they cant put the canula in the left side as had no lymph nodes and cant have blood pressure done on that side either with having no lymph nodes on that side ,so any veins used to inser the canula was only allowed on my right side .  Chemo does have side effects but  one thing to remember everyone is different  .i never got every side effect on the list and any side effects the oncologist  was there to help me manage them ,if feeling  nausea was givin anti sickness medication . if you  ever want a chat or any advise just PM me .i would like to feel i can now help other people who are going through whot i been through well  similar ,wishing you loads of luck take care  Virtual hugs  X",
