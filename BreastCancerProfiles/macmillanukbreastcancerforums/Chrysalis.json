Only another 7 months to go.  I have used a prothesis and pocketed bra and swimwear. I use http://www.amoena.com/uk-en/ Great site. Don't let this little set back get you down.

      "Content": "Hi, hoping to help. After I finished chemo I was left with constant excruciating aches and pain, then I started Tamoxifen and this increased the aches and pains ten fold. I was passed from pillar to post and it seemed no one knew what to do. My oncologist said she had never came across this problem with a patient. That no one she had treated had ever described experiencing pain the way I was. I had started to use a wheel chair and mobility scooter for days out. I could barely get down the stairs in the morning and my days seemed bleak. I managed to struggle on enough to go to my local Hospice each Monday, then even that became to difficult. Still, my cancer care team were at a complete loss. My oncologist seemed happy that my cancer was stable and so her job was done. I sat in her room crying, saying 'It isn't you that has to wake each morning after barely sleeping because the pain is unbearable. Just to crawl down the stairs and ask my wife to dress me.' I could see by her expression that she was at a complete loss. My BCN's had nothing to add and were just as baffled. After missing several Hospice dates I managed to drag myself there. The palliative care doctor there was kind enough to see me and asked what medication I was taking. 90mg Zomorph morning and evening 15ml Oramorph every 2 hours, 24 hours a day. Gabapentin 3600mg a day Paracetamol every 4 hours Ibuprofen 3 x a day Tamoxifen 20mg daily Amitriptyline 70mg daily Mirtazapine 45mg daily And still I was in agony, unable to sleep, could barely walk and I was exhausted. She requested that my GP put me on a Fentynal Patch, starting me on a low dose with the intention of increasing it as needed. 37mcg Patch for 10 days and no change apart from the fact that I was no longer taking Zomorph or drinking Oramorph every 2 hours. My GP increased it to 75mcg and I felt 50% better. I requested we go up to 100mcg and I felt 90% better. In 4 weeks I have gone from crawling out of bed to skipping out of bed with a smile on my face. Maybe worth mentioning Fentynal Patches to your GP. It's like a nicotine patch and you simply change it every 3 days. It's changed my life completely.",

You have done the right thing in getting referred as soon as you realised something is not as it should be. Also, stay positive, there are many reasons why our bodies change, not all are dreadful. For everything in life, there is support..... like on here.",
