    "Content": "Hi, I'm newly diagnosed as well. Had my first surgery to remove all lymph nodes as well as lump, but had to go back to have \"wider margins\" taken. For me the second surgery was a lot easier to handle and recover from but then again I had no more nodes left to take (I think) I haven't really asked many questions about anything, I mean I only found out the seriousness of a lymphodema by google :s I had 11 nodes taken 10 of which had cancer and as for size of lump I had no idea that they would be able to tell me, I'm back on Tuesday getting the path results from my \"scrape\" so I'll defo ask them. As for anything else I'm sorry I can't help I'm just as clueless about everything at the mo :( I saw the second surgery as a \" lets make sure we get this sucker so I can heal and get back to my life with my kids\" sort of thing. Good luck with your surgery hope all goes well xxxx",
