My joints have really suffered, my pain is mainly in my lower back and it sometimes feel like I've been kicked in the back by a shire horse !! It improves a bit during the day and tends to be worse in the mornings - I'm putting up with it as it reduces the chance of cancer recurring..but I'm not having a great time on it - it seems like some people are fine on Letrozole and some do not fare so well. Fingers crossed that it improves for you (and me) :) xx",

I'm just looking back through all my treatment and wonder if anyone knows what they test your bloods for when you go for your pre-assessment before lumpectomy. I never asked at the time as I was just so relieved that all seemed to be fine and my op could go ahead, but I do like to know as much as I can about everything that formed part of my treatment plan.

It all went really really well and I was so well looked after, I didn't have much pain afterwards, it was a bit sore but a couple of painkillers took care of it and I only needed them for one day. I went in early in the morning and when I'd recovered from the op and was wheeled back to the day surgery ward a lovely nurse bought me hot buttered toast and a cup of tea (it was the best tea and toast I've ever tasted) !! They will check you until they think you are ready to go and then send you off with all your after care leaflets. I dressed myself and was collected by my son and we got a taxi home. It was all pretty straightforward. It is really normal to be anxious but you'll be absolutely fine and delighted that the little monster of a lump has been removed or as my lovely BC nurse said \"it's on the slab in the lab\" !!! Good luck with everything and let us know how you get on. xx",

I've read reports to say that 10 years is better than 5 years so I emailed my breast care nurse to ask if I can stay on it for a further 5 years. She said there is evidence to support extended endocrine therapy for a further 5 years but this is based on your own specific cancer type, and is aimed at the higher risk group, those ladies who required chemotherapy. Letrozole is seen as one of the superior treatments, and 5 years is seen as adequate.  She also said she would discuss it at their next meeting. I've had a further response which reads: \"We discussed your case in our meeting on Friday, the team feel that we could recommend a further 5 years of endocrine therapy with Tamoxifen. The problem with extending treatment with Letrozole is that it could affect your bone health and increase the risk of osteoporosis.\"    I'm a bit confused by this as I thought Tamoxifen was only prescribed for pre menopausal women ?   I really want to limit the risk of recurrence but not sure how Tamoxifen will benefit me.   any advice gratefully received  ",

I am back on the national screening programme and went for a mammogram today in one of the mobile units. I asked one of the staff if they would be comparing this mammogram to my last one and she said \"if we need to\". I emailed my breast cancer nurse and she said that as far as she was aware the Screening service will only review previous imaging if anything is needed to further assess breast tissue. It's not done as a matter of routine. i was really surprised about this. My discharge letter last year outlined my treatment and also mentioned  \"a small benign type mass in the upper half of my left breast which remains unchanged since 2014, there are no features of malignancy seen\u201d.  I'm just worried that if they don't compare images they will call me back when they spot this ? as usual, I'm frightening myself to death again. as always, I'm hugely grateful for all the invaluable advice I've received here. xx",

My latest mammogram reports a mixed density breast parenchyma ( I have no idea what this means). The right breast has features consistent with previous surgery and surgical clips are present, there is no change seen since 2015 (I thought they measured change year by year). What has really freaked me out are the words \"in the left breast there is a small benign mass in the upper half which remains unchanged since 2014, there are no features of malignancy seen\" - I had absolutely no idea about this benign mass or how long it's been there !...how can they tell it's ok without a biopsy and is it likely to wake up and turn nasty in the future ?. I am so happy that I'ce reached my 5 year milestone but this letter has given me the jitters. Has anyone else had a similar experience ? thanks as always for all the fab advice I've received over the years - I am a worry pants but i can't  help it Xx",

My doc told me that it was 99.9% cancer, he also told me that it looked nasty and that the lymph nodes looked to be infected. My sister was with me and instead of going home and discussing it, we went to the pub and got plastered (it seemed a good idea at the time ) !! You will have a much better idea when they you get your results. Because of what the doc had said to me I was prepared for the worst, but it turned out that the lymph nodes weren't affected and it was a very early stage cancer, so you just can't tell until they have the results but it doesn't stop you worrying I know. I agree with the other posts, take someone with you as I was amazed at what my sister remembered from the conversation that had completely gone in one of my ears and out of the other. Everyone told me that as soon as the results are in and a treatment plan is put in place I would feel better and it is so true. It's the waiting and the unknown of what you are dealing with that is so scary isn't it ? Thinking of you and wishing you all the best...I never fail to be amazed at the advances in treatment of BC..it's getting better all the time. xx",

My treatment plan is 15 sessions of Radiotherapy and Letrozole for 5 years. There was never any mention of chemotherapy but I have wondered if I should be having it  ? There is a test that is offered to women in America with early stage breast cancer with no node involvement. (I copied the next two paragraphs from the website) Oncotype DX is a diagnostic test that helps identify which women with early-stage, estrogen-receptor positive and lymph-node-negative breast cancer are more likely to benefit from adding chemotherapy to their hormonal treatment. The Oncotype DX test provides important information that you and your doctor may use when making decisions about treatment. Post-menopausal women recently diagnosed with node-positive, hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer may also be appropriate candidates for the Oncotype DX test. I wonder if it will ever be available in this country, it makes sense to me that this test could determine if chemotheraphy would benefit you or not allowing you to make much more informed treatment decisions. Has anyone heard of this test ?",

      "Content": "Hi all, I was diagnosed last November with grade 2, 19mm idc. No nodes affected, clear margins and no vascular invasion. I had a lumpectomy, 15 rads and am on Letrozole for 5 years. I've had pain and discomfort on the affected side ever since (rads finished in march). I thought it was due to the Letrozole but am wondering it could be nerve pain. I get a pain in my outer outer arm If I stretch my arm in the air or reach for something a bit awkwardly it also feels like it will only go high and pulls a bit with a pain in the breast too. Some days it's not too bad but it's there all the time and sometimes feels really achey. I have had a pinched nerve before (not bc connected) and it feels similar. I never had any of this before my diagnosis and wonder if anyone else has suffered in a similar way, The side I didn't have the breast cancer is fine. I feel that I got off very lightly with my diagnosis and treatment but this discomfort has quite literally been a pain ! Wishing you all a great weekend xx",

The aches have improved a bit but I was wondering if it was OK to take calcium suppliments such as Osteocare ? I have tried to 'google' but can't see any big warnings not to take it ? Wondered if anyone else on Letrozole or other hormone tablets were taking it ? Many thanks and a Happy Bank Holiday Monday (what's left of it) :)..",

      "Content": "I was dx in November with grade 2 Invasive ductal BC, had lumpectomy in December and was very very lucky to have no nodes affected and nice clear margins. Was prescribed Letrozole and 15 sessions of radiotherapy. Finished rads about 3 weeks ago and had follow up appointment with my oncologist. Told her I'd suffered a bit with rad burns and she asked me how I was doing on Letrozole. I told her that I've had a couple of bouts of cystitus, but seem to be suffering a bit now with aches and pains (mainly in shoulders and neck), she didn't seem concerned and said that it was a side effect of Letrozole and hopefully should calm down eventually. I take pain killers for it every now and again but it doesn't cause me too many problems. It's back to yearly mammograms for me now. Just wanted to give a bit of hope to all ladies newly diagnosed. I remember being so terrified when I went for my recall, and biopsies and ultrasound revealed a lump. The doctor said that it 'looked nasty' and that the lymph nodes looked to be affected (they weren't), I've never been so scared in my life and never believed I would be sitting here now writing a positive update. It's a tough old journey and I'm so grateful to this group for all the advice and lovely lovely support. Big huge hugs to each and every one of you on this 'rollercoaster' !! xx",
