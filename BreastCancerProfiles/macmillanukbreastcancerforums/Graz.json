      "Content": "Exactly Sainty!  At the time of diagnosis the lump in my breast was 5 cm in diameter and the surgeon said that, due to my young age (hahaha ;-p), they want to go for lumpectomy but need to try and shrink the tumour first... Then I was also told that if I didn't respond to chemo as expected I would end up having mx, but, thank God, the lump did shrink and lumpectomy followed the 6 doses of chemo. Also, it's worth remembering that every patient is treated individually and many factors are taken into consideration before a certain course of action is taken to beat the cancer...  Graz  } :O) }",

      "Content": "Hi Boneyem and others :-)   I so understand your anxiety. Last year, when I was diagnosed with stage IIb, HR+ BC, the first thing I was worried about was my boys (8 and 6). Cancer never comes at the right time and in my case, the diagnosis was given just months after divorce proceedings with my ex husband started.... so, it was even more essential for me to get as much support for the boys as possible (especially that I do not have any extended family here as I am an expat in the UK) and the school have been more than helpful, and so was my church. When my oldest son got worried during my chemo treatment (I had a Hickman line fitted, then taken out and replaced by the PICC one and the boys saw it dangling on my arm...), I decided to take both of them to the chemo unit in Bedford where I was treated and they loved the place - the nurses showed them around, gave them some sweets, they could see how friendly and warm the atmosphere was in the chemo suite and relaxed, to my great relief! :D The chemo was tough at times, but I managed to laugh my way through it with the help of the loving chemo nurses. The lump shrunk and I had lumpectomy and sentinel node biopsy in December. Unfortunately, the biopsy showed the node had cancerous cells and so the MDT (multi-disciplinary team) decided I should have the axillary clearance, which was done last month (a bit later than planned as I had an infection). I am still a bit sore and swollen after the last op, but happy the aggressor is out :-) Now, I have started taking Tamoxifen - five years treatment; and in a few weeks am starting radiotherapy. I am feeling sort of worn out and at times have felt guilty that, at the moment, I am not as active with the boys as I used to, but they have been so understanding for their age! They have coped much better than I thought they would, but am sure the support from all sides has been crucial. When I had the PICC line removed, I brought it home to show them that one stage of the treatment is already over. They have accompanied me all the way, my two brave soldiers! :D All will be well, you will see! :-)",
