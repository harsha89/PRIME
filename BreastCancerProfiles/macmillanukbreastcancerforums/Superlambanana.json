      "Content": "Evening everyone, Just wanted to share the fact that I have been using Cica-care silicone gel sheets on my lumpectomy scars. I had it for scaring to my hand after the chemo leaked but after 3 years of lymphodema and pain in my breast tried the gel sheets with a nothing tried nothing gained attitude. The difference is extraordinary. I am now pain free (as long as I keep using the sheets) can travel by car for longer journeys (previously the bumpy ride would become intolerable and exhausting) and even run short distances without becoming overwhelmed and exhausted by the pain. The lymphodema has also reduced and I have started to get some feeling back in my arm too. There is no evidence base for this but it is such good news for me I wanted to share it in case it works for others. Take care xx",
