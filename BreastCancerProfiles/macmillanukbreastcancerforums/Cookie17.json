    "Content": "I agree with Ali Owl Ange.  I have come out of a dark place myself having had a tough time with a new drug I was given and the side effects were really affecting my quality of life, so much so, I have been given permission to come off the chemo and after a few days of freedom from the drug, I can honestly say that  I am turning a corner and like you Ange, can for the first time appreciate the every day things in life. I can get emotional too so you are not alone. You are a strong person Ange to have come through smiling out the other side. All power to you girl. And big hugs to you and your friend when you are next having treatment.",
