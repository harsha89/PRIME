      "Content": "Hi Sarah  I'm sorry to hear your feeling sick to its awful isn't it , all I can say is it does get better are you on the same chemo as me fec? , I felt sick for 3 days then it did start to fade a bit I found eating a ginger biscuit in the morning helped me an a walk in the fresh air helps the head aches , my throat is very dry at the mo and I'm a bit achy now just over a week since chemo and starting to feel like me again which is nice, I'm nervous about doing it all again in a couple off weeks but have to think off the positives and think worse case it's a week poorly then two OK, I didn't go for the cold cap was it OK? Good luck with your next chemo how many do you have to have ? X Lisa xxx",
