      "Content": "Hi,    I have had both!   My 1st mastectomy was 11 years ago, and the hospital i was in at the time didn't do recon at the same time, so i didn't have the option.  I waited 10 months after surgey for recon using back flap procedure.  The result was amazing although very painful but worth it.  I had another mastectomy last november including immediate recon using an expander, although it isn't finished until  after my chemo, it already looks extremely good and with less scarring than the 1st one and less painful. I know everyone is different but if i had the choice again i would definately opt for immediate recon. Hope this helps",

      "Content": "Hi, I've just read your discussion, and would like to give you my opinion on the cold cap.  I have just had treatment no. 6 of 8 and have still got my hair, although it has thinned a great deal.  The 1st cold cap was the worst, the 1st 15 minutes were extremeley painful, but if you can get through that it's fine.  I needed a piece of gauze underneath cap on forehead, and i was told that migraine strips are good to put on forehead, although i didnt use them, but i did have a headache.  I didn't care how bad the pain was, i would have done anything to keep my hair, and i have proof that it works.  No-one even knows that i am having chemo.  I do have some bald patches on the top, but i expected this as the cap sometimes doesn't fit snug enough on the top.  I wear my hair in a ponytail, with a hairpiece on a scrunchie, which i did before anyway, and it looks normal.  I hope this is of some help to you, and wish you well in your treatment.   xx",

      "Content": "Hi, I would like to share my experience with you if it will be of any help.  My lost my mom to breast cancer when she was 41. I was then diagnosed with DCIS when i was 35, after 3 attemps at surgery, i was told i had to have a mastectomy. I had reconstruction which i must say looks amazing.  In october last year it returned in the other breast after 11 years,, this time DC grade 3 which came on in just 6 months, having had a mammagram 6 months previous.  I was told i could have a lumpectomy, but said no, without any doubt in my mind i wanted a mastectomy.  I had reconstruction straight away with expander, and again it looks really good., and am now having chemo whereas i had no treatment at all previously.  If only i had been given the chance to have a double mastectomy 1st time, it would have saved me many years of worry about it coming back - which it has done, and i would not be in the position that i am now having to go through chemo.  I must say that i would at least have had peace of mind.

      "Content": "Hi, many thanks for your relpy.  I have had 2 sessions of epirubicin with 1 more next week, then changes to CMF.  I can honestly say, that so far i have only had 1 day where i have felt minorly ill, the rest of the time i have felt really well. The nurse told me i would feel tired, but haven't even felt that.  I have got to thinking is this the calm before the storm? and will i get to feel really ill with the CMF?  Are the side effects any different and have you lost your hair on Epi or does it come out on CMF.   My oncologist's understudy who i wasn't impressed with said to me 'you will lose your  hair' and then a nurse said you might not lose it with epi, but you will lose it with cmf.   My body hair went after 2 weeks of starting, but still have my hair at the moment (am using cold cap) but not holding out much hope after what they said to me.",
