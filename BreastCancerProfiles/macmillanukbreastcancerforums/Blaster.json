Had one treatment of chemo due another on Monday then I have another in 3 weeks before starting the herceptin along with a different chemo. Been told I have to have herceptin for 12 months from starting it. Also after all the chemo I then have my operation followed by radiotherapy.  First chemo was the week of Xmas and I was scared, but it has gone well, they give you tablets to help if you feel any sickness, they certainly keep their eye on you. Hope all goes well, one step at a time. Xx",
