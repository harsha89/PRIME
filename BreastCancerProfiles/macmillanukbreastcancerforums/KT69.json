      "Content": "Hi Georgie18, Thank you, just back from my pre-chemo consultation and  then I have the 1st chemo tomorrow - and I was actually reading these replies before I went in and ending up crying as soon as I walked in there. But the nurse was brilliant, she let me get it all out. It did make me feel a lot better. I think it has just crept up on me so quickly and now that its here its like oh **** ! My husband is being really good, but sometimes he gets really emotional hence why I have tried to be really brave, but that's not helping me? I'm sure it will all be fine in the end and everything that I'm doing can only benefit me. Work has been really good and I can take as much time as I need and don't ever worry about not being able to get in - so again I'm quite lucky there as well. Take care and hope everything goes well for you x",

      "Content": "Hi Linda, Many thanks for your kind reply - I think you're probably right, seeing my mum go through this not once, twice but now three times has been very stressful, and to watch my Dad and sister both pass away from lung cancer in the last couple of years doesn't make it any easier. And knowing that my Mum will never be free of it also doesn't help. But you're right I need to let things out if it makes me feel better, I just don't want to do it in front of family as I'm not one that likes people to feel sorry for me? Maybe that makes me a bit hard, I'm not sure. But as I said in my other reply to Georgie18, I actually fell apart in front of the nurse today - I think it probably makes it easier in front of a stranger?   I will certainly keep in touch on here and let you all know how things go. Thanks for your concern Karen x",

      "Content": "Hi... I was diagnosed with breast cancer in December 2017 and have since had a lumpectomy and now about to start a course of chemo, then radiotherapy and finally hormone therapy. All this time I have been helping my mum through her third course of chemo and its now starting to get real for me. I have been, I think, really quite strong up till now but am starting to feel really quite emotional and am welling up for no reason at all. Maybe I'm not so brave after all..",
