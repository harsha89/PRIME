      "Content": "Hi, my advice is pretty similar that you should call them and let them know. Make sure that the info you give them is logged. Me and my late husband were 'golden oldie' reps and we had to do hospital visits as part of our duties and you wouldnt believe the problems that were encountered by our guests just because they didnt let their insurance companies know. It may only take a phone call to sort it out. NOT that you are a 'golden oldie' ................!!!!!!!",
