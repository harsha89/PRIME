    "Content": "Hi My Lovely My mum was diagnosed on 14th August with a large aggressive tumour in her left breast. It has been a roller coaster ride to say the least. She had it removed then had 15 sessions of radiotherapy she lives about 2 1/2 hr drive and an hour on a car ferry to get to her (she lives on the Isle of Wight) it's difficult being so far away but I think it's important to just be there as and when she needs me, I had a week with her for her radiotherapy and although the daily trips to the hospital were tiring (for us both) it was nice just to have some time together and we met some lovely people on our journey, which was a 2 hr round trip. I think the normal conversations mean the most trying not to change it too much. She talks to me about the cancer when she wants to but I don't push it, I think the constant asking if she's ok from people can get a bit much. I would definitely encourage your mum to keep busy my mum has rekindled her love of knitting and has made all her own Christmas cards it will keep her mind off things and feel like she's doing something worthwhile, she's also now bored of being off work. As difficult as it is stay positive and just be there when she needs you, initially it feels like your world has fallen apart but after diagnosis and having a plan it is a lot easier. Good luck big hugs! X X X X X",
