      "Content": "Hi Careermindedoptimist ! I have very similar results to you but my margin at the fascia of my chest wall was not clear . I totally expected to have chemo but I was then offered the Onco test which agonisingly came back as 24 ! I had decided that although I really didn\u2019t want chemo I would do whatever the Oncologist told me to do ! However when I met with her she was of the opinion , totally unprompted by me , that I did not require chemo as my tumour was small and lymph nodes clear . The benefit to me was small for chemo 3-6% , she also recommended 15 rads plus 4 boosters and Letrozole  for 5 years . I was ecstatic !! I also did loads of reading on this site and others and found really interesting research called Tailor X . Your brain will be overloaded with info at the moment but knowledge is power . Best wishes xx",
