      "Content": "Almost 5 years after being diagnosed and undergoing treatment, I still feel tired. Most days I try to lead a normal life as possible but I find it hard.  I  feel a lot of pain in my joints and my chest bone hurts. I understand that these might be the usual after effects of treatment but for me this is 5 years after and my fatigue and joint pain has not reduced I am on a course of Tamoxifen and I have not had my periods since.I am aware this could be a major cause of the pain. Can anyone advice on how best to manage this pain and fatigue as it is quite frankly, demoralising..",
