      "Content": "Has anyone experienced this? I was told it could be the way the nurse put the tube in my wrist.  3 weeks in the pain is not as bad only along the vein from the wrist but now I can't straighten my arm from my elbow it's really tight and painful. I've been trying to move it as much as I can but I'm afraid it's still stuck at the elbow. Just wanted to know is this common and what exercises to help get movement back as I'm having another chemo session next week. Oh by the way I had really bad heart burn anyone experience that as it wasn't on my list of side effects",
