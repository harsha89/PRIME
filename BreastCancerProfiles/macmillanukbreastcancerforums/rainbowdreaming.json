      "Content": "I probably shouldn\u2019t be on this thread as I got my initial diagnosis in March! After first biopsy, I was told I had 2 small lumps grade 1 IDC, spanning 2.5cm overall. I then waited almost 3 weeks for an MRI which came back inconclusive. I then had a full breast ultrasound which highlighted another suspicious area which led to another biopsy, again this came back as grade 1.  This has meant I\u2019m no longer eligible for lumpectomy as its classed as multi focal. I\u2019m booked for mastectomy on the 1st May. I spent the first 4weeks in total shock and yet by the time it came to being told I need an mx, I was strangely calm and unsurprised. I still don\u2019t know what the rest of my treatment plan will be. My biggest problem is that I still haven\u2019t told most of my family. I have no idea how to tell my kids (aged 27 & 9). My mum doesn\u2019t know yet ( we\u2019re not particularly close and I can\u2019t support her when I need my strength for myself) would it be really bad if I did it over the phone? Also does anyone have any advice on how to tell my youngest without scaring her silly. The eldest doesn\u2019t live at home so it\u2019s slightly easier to hide     it from him. Sorry for the essay! I tend to lurk and read everyone\u2019s posts rather than post myself, it seems to have helped me process my thoughts so thank you to everyone on this site.",

Clear nodes stage 1 and very low ki67 scores of 3 & 5%. I was originally told I was HER negative but they have apparently retested and changed one of them to positive! I have requested repeat testing of the HER receptors on all 3. I\u2019ve been told chemo is still not a definite as the data for benefit is mostly based on larger more aggressive tumours. I\u2019m waiting for an appointment with the oncologist to discuss it further. The predict tool may be useful for you.

      "Content": "Hi Kimbeeloo Oncotype dx is not available if you\u2019re her+. You can certainly request repeat testing, I have. I\u2019m still not convinced they\u2019re correct. You can ask how many pathologists have reviewed your result, if only one, then ask for someone else to look at it also. IHC testing tends to be done first as its quicker and cheaper, and if this result is borderline then they will move on to FISH which is more sensitive. I had 3 tumours, all of which were HER negative until they did a repeat test and got one of them positive by IHC even though it was originally negative by FISH! I\u2019ve already had a mastectomy so any further treatment would be to prevent recurrence. I\u2019m seeing an oncologist on Wednesday to discuss it further. Good luck",
