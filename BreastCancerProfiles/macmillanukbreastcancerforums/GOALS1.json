    "Content": "Could someone help me out with this., I just had my third mammogram and my past ones have been all cleared. This one shows a finding of irregular calicum deposits in my left breast., My doctor is waiting to view my past images to see if they have always been there. But I know from my past finding that they were not. My doctor says at this time he wants me back in 6 mths to recheck this area until he veiws the past images. Should I be concerned about this?
