      "Content": "i was diagmosed with bc last march with 2 tumours and had my mastectomy 10 days later and i began my chemo about 6 weeks later at the start of may and i got it every 3 weeks, I know how scared you must be feeling right now and worried not just for yourself but also for family and friends but you will get through this, i only joined this site a few days ago but found everyone to be really friendly and helpful and all i can say to you is just take this one step at a time it helped me through it anyway i concentrated on what was happening to me at that time not what was going to happen next, i dont know everyone is different and copes in different ways. Hope all goes well for you take care Linda x x",
