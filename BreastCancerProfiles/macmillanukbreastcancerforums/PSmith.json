      "Content": "Hi, Up until last year I worked in a Breast clinic, both in the ultra sound room and sitting in with the Dr when results were given. The radiologists took biopsies whenever any abnormality was seen unless it could be confirmed that it was a cyst or just dense breast tissue so they are ultra cautious not to miss anything. Sitting in MDT meetings it was always a joy when results came back and the area of doubt was nothing and many did!! If cancer is confirmed then the Drs will together discuss the way forward and a plan of treatment  so that the patient isn't just told the news but also what the treatment plan is. Many results came back as nothing sinister and as hard as it is, try not to worry until you know. I wish you luck x",
