Both he and my bcn said the choice for the op will ultimately be mine but I've got around 6 months to decide what is best for me. It's fantastic that you're still NED and that you got what you wanted.",

Also told today that, although the neo-adjuvant chemo is still the first step for me, the lymph node biopsy showed cancerous cells so I have a bone scan and CT scan scheduled for tomorrow to let them - and me - know if the cancer has gone walkabouts. Preparing for the worst but hoping for the best. On the plus side, my request for the PICC line has been approved because of my needle phobia, so that's one less thing to stress about. It looks like breast-conserving surgery is likely, providing the BRCA results don't put a spanner in the works. Lymph nodes removal seems to be a given. So, all in all, my glass is still half full!",

Before I was diagnosed with tnbc in June I would donate my hair to the Princess Trust every time I got it cut - from very long (to my bottom) to short every few years - and the last time was just after my diagnosis (very short bob) when I was told chemo was the first step of my treatment (which I started on July 13th). Now my hair is falling out at quite an alarming rate - about half has gone now but it was really thick and I had a lot of it so people haven't noticed yet - and still I can't bring myself to \"brave the shave\". I'm not sure if I'll be strong enough to do it when it's more obvious and I admire those who are. We who are going through this terrible disease are the ones who are brave as we have no choice but to be! I'm sorry if that offends anyone but it's how I feel. Evie S makes a truly valid point about the blind charities and I'm dumbfounded that Macmillan are being so insensitive to how strongly we feel about this.",

      "Content": "Hello fellow chemoers, I hope you are all managing to stay cool. TheScriptFan I'm so sorry to hear that your 1st chemo is not treating you kindly. Unfortunately the first one can be a bit trial and error with the meds and SEs but the general rules seem to be: drink plenty of fluids, especially as it's soooo hot; eat little and often; try to rest when you can and listen to your body. Also, remember to tell your team about any SEs - I find keeping a diary helps - so they tailor the meds/treatment for you. I'm sure the other more experienced ladies will be able to give you more advice. Sammystaff I'm sorry about your sore throat. I've also been suffering from a sore throat for a couple of days so I know it's not fun. I've found that gargling salt water helps a little. I hope you feel better soon. Ms Jolly I hope your 2nd chemo goes/went well and that the SEs are minimal. I'm on day 13 of my 1st chemo and I've been very lucky. Only SEs so far are: headaches (days 6-10); taste buds have gone awol (since day 8); and 2 mouth ulcers (day 11-13). I've had more trouble with my PICC line than the chemo! It's bled twice (2nd time saw me in A&E for 7 1/2 hrs), the stitch came loose (reason for A&E visit) and today it has flared up with a lovely rash, which was revealed when they changed the dressings. They put a allergen-free one on but that has made it really itchy. Hopefully it's just heat rash but I'm going to take antihistamines to see if that helps. Sorry for the long post (waffling as per) and I hope you are all as well as can be x",

I'm sorry that you feel like your body has let you down, you've been through so much that maybe it's just simply trying to tell you it needs a bit of a break. Fingers (and everything else) crossed that your onco appointment goes well. Take care, be kind to yourself and enjoy your prosecco! Gentle hugs, Frankie xx Update: day 15 (1st EC) - throat still sore but luckily normal temperature. Also tummy being playing up a little today and rash still causing a little mischief but my SEs could've been so much worse so I'm just keeping track of them in my diary and taking each day as it comes. Take care and have a great weekend xx",

Neoadjuvant chemo was on the cards since 1st diagnosis on June 18th and I've requested a PICC line from then, which my onco agreed with mainly because of my needle phobia. Spoke to the chemo unit doctor today, who also agreed that this was best and he said we'll speak about in depth on Tuesday's meeting. I've been told I have this as my chemo will be at a different hospital so I'm comfortable there before my 1st session on Friday. Yes, you're right. I remember my onco mentioning G-CSF now. A lot was discussed on Wednesday so I think I got some things confused. Or I was still buzzing after being told it hadn't spread to my bones!",

I love to crochet and have many wips on the go at one time. Mainly because I start a project, then see another and simply have to have a go. Patience is not one of my strengths. I also dabble in knitting - usually when I have to as it hurts my hands - and cross-stitching. I have been known to do the odd loop rug kit. I'm not great but, as they say, God loves a trier! I love the knitted knockers idea and, unless there's a crochet version anywhere, I may have to see if I can knock a few up. As a technophobe, I have no idea how to post up any of my finished projects so I apologise for just being a viewer.",

      "Content": "Hi everyone, I hope you all managing to stay cool. I have a worry about my 15yo son and I was wondering if anyone has/is going through a similar experience and has any advice. He's been through a tough time already as his nan, who he was really close to, died of cancer 18 months ago. She found a lump, had chemo & op but then it spread to her bones & organs and 9 1/2 years later sadly lost her battle. He had a few wobbles and tantrums, totally understandably, but all in all he coped very well. His school counsellor was fantastic but she's no longer at his school due to cutbacks. Now he's got to go through it all again with me. I have tnbc stage 3 with node involvement but, thankfully, it hasn't spread to my bones or organs. I start EC-T on Friday then I'll be having an op. I know it's not my fault but I feel guilty to put him through this again. And now he's older, and terribly hormonal, he's kicking off at school and he feels like all the teachers are against him. I'm getting phone calls almost daily and I have to explain that I've got health issues and that he's not handling it very well. I know his education is very important, although he really doesn't seem to care, and I don't know what to do. His dad tries to help but his wife rules their roost and limits his involvement. I'm able to deal with my battle but I can't seem to cope with the school situation and I'm really worried about my son. I'm not sure where else to turn.",

My son and I have now had a proper talk about it and he has finally opened up to me a little, which is a start, and he's agreed to go to our gp to get him some counselling, which is a huge step for him.",
