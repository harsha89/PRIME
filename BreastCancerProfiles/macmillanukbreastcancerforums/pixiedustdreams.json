    "Content": "I finished chemo at the end of February and just had the 4th of 5 radiotherapy sessions today. Also been on Tamoxifen for 2 weeks. I too have aching joints especially the tops of my legs and it can be agony to walk. I can't even remember when it started, as I had aching joints from chemo anyway. To start with I thought it was that but now I think it's to do with the Tamoxifen but not sure at all. Hoping someone has some advice Tina",
