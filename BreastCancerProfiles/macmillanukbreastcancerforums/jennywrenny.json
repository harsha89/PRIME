    "Content": "Hi Dee After my second dose of chemo I had awful acid indigestion, so much so I was crying in the early hours of the morning it was so bad. My GP prescribed Omeprazol because he said Gaviscon wouldn't touch this type of acid due to chemo, I'm on Cyclophosphomide as well. Hope this helps but I find that there is always something that happens each month and this site is invaluable for the information and help you can get. There is always someone out there willing to listen and help All the best Jenny",
