      "Content": "Hi Hannah, I had my head shaved in a grade 2 yesterday; little bit tearful and glad i had a short wig to walk out with as if nothing had happened. i need to come to terms with the baldness on my own before I can go public. Our local wig lady is connected to the hospital and sponsored by a cancer charity which lets us choose 2 good wigs for free. We do not have lots of stock; we go through the catalogues helped by the fab wig lady who than orders a load in different styles and colours and will subsequently trim them to your liking. The ones you don't take will be sent back.  Our wig lady tells me that you need to choose a wig with monofilament for most natural look; a see-through bit at the front or where the parting is that looks just like normal scalp. when the colours come all in, stand in good natural light to try them. be quite brutal manhandling them in the right shape with your fingers. I had some very similar looking colours but when i tried they were quite different and one complimented my skin tone much better than the other.  As I was allowed 2, i have also gone for a fun wig; long and streaky like Angelina Jolie (or so my husband says). If nothing else, it puts a smile on my face! I have a cotton cap to go under the scarfs to make sure they dont slip. and I have dusted off all the earrings in my posssion as I think the scarf look really asks for some big statement earrings. I have practiced the Creole look today; both scarf and earrings; quite please with the result and again; it put a smile on my face. Best of luck with treatment and wig hunting. Keep up the spirit!

      "Content": "Hi Ronstar, I had my single mastectomy before chemo (currently on 4th round). My surgeon was reluctant to do double mastectomy as well for 2 reasons; 1. Double would lengthen recovery time (and therefore delay start of chemo). You should not have to worry about this consideration. 2. He wanted to make sure I didn't make the decision in an emotional state to regret it later. Your arguments sound reasonable and you are gathering info, so you should be able to be assertive once you are certain. I obviously didn't have the double, so can't comment on that, but have experience with single and fake boob. It is true that you always have to think about the prosthetic before going out. I don't like sleeping with it and swimming on the beach would certainly be easier if I had had a double mastectomy. Easier to be flat on both sides and not worry about moving prosthetics from swim gear to bra etc. Like you set, for Going out or when you want to look feminine you could get a nice pair of cup C prosthetics and be as glam as you want. I hope this helps and I hope there will be some people who decided for double mastectomy reply as well; would be good for me as well to hear pros and cons ( still considering mastectomy of the remaining breast after I've had radiotherapy - I am currently not keen on reconstruction either). Take care Xx",

      "Content": "Hi Gwynnie, I had the same thing; bladder lining was sensitive and had a bit more of incontinence towards end of chemo. Any taps running whilst my bladder was full and I had to run to the toilet to avoid any major mishaps.  Gynaecologist advised not to drink any alcohol or caffeine as this upsets the bladder lining even more. I did this until approx 6 weeks after chemo. Now taking occasional glass of wine and coffee but problems have gone (meanwhile 5 months post chemo). Take care and good luck with your last 2 chemos!

Choose a gentle reading voice + You can put a sleep timer on ; often helped me go back to sleep even though I was scared stiff. Talking with women that have gone through the same Not sure if any of this will help you. Thinking of you. Xxx",

      "Content": "Hi Rach, Sounds like cording to me. I get this on and off, usually after I have done something too strenuous on our boat. I do my exercises as well as I can to the point it hurts a little but I'm not yet screaming with pain. I increase the number of times I do them and try to lay my arm outstretched above my head with a heavy beanbag on the upper arm. I also massage the arm in little circles and through rubbing from arm pit to inside of arm, inside of elbow and lower arm if it got that far. Sometime also the chest wall but don't rub too vigorously. I was also told to use warm wet cloths, but I find that tedious. I try to do at least one round of exercise and massage under a warm shower. Usually my dymptoms disappear in a few weeks. Doing nothing about it makes it worse as if ivy is  growing along and taking it further down my arm. Hope this helps. Big hug   Gigi",
