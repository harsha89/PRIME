    "Content": "Hello My wife has recently had a double mastectomy with immediate Free DIEP flap reconstruction Other than a few minor niggles during surgery (15 hours!) and some increase in lactic acid levels immediately after surgery everything has gone well and her doctors are very pleased with her progress. Except she is having a lot of pain from her feet as they appear to be hypersensitive and nobody seems to be able to tell us why has anybody here had a similar experience or heard of anything like this happening? Thank you in advance",
