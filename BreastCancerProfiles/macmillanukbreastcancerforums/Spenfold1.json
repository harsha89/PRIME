Now I'm stronge enough I want to start fundraising and my 1st fundraise is climbing Londons O2 roof I can't wait I'm so excited and all what is raised gets donate to L.G.F.B so they can continue these lovely sessions. So if you not yet been to 1 get I touch with your Macmillan in they will help you book a session.  Go on.. Do it.. You deserve it  love Sarah x    ",

Now I'm feeling like I'm running out of energy n feel like curling up n crying but putting on a smile for my kids coz I don't want them to know I'm broken.  When I finished chemo I was so possitive about the future, gave up smoking 5wks ago to try and make my quality of life better.  I've been taking champix to help me with this n side effects r a bit like menopause n was looking forward to finishing this course n feel normal again.  Then I read the side effects of tamoxifen and at the age of 39 I'm finding it hard to accept I may never feel like my old self again. good luck to u both  love Sarah ",

Now to find the courage to start my Tamoxifen (praying it's good to me) So that is that nearly 10mths ago my world crashed to a hault and thrown onto an uncontrollable rollor coaster, now I'm reflecting and can't believe I had chemo x6 FEC-T, lumpectomy on both boobs, 12 lympthnoids out and finally 20 blasts of radiotherapy. Now that's hard core treatment ladies we have all faced or is beginning to face. I guess what I'm trying to point out is, when you think you can't go on anymore somehow we just find that strength to soldier on and it saddens me to read newbies joining the grp and remembering the fear I had.  You will be fine it's tough I will not lie but you can kick ass just like I DID !! much love Sarah xx",

Very shocked with the size of my medicine bag I've brought home this time ha ha. 5 tubes of creams for dry skin, eye drops for dry eye, sickness pills, antibiotic mouthwash in case I get ulcers and oral thrush again ( common reaction to Tax) anti- reaction pills for tha Tax drug that it swimming around my system and finally the shocker of all, they now want me to bloody inject myself for a wk to help my white cells arghh come on really.  I've come this far with now extra antibiotic or major infections, my bloods have  always been fine just b4 treatment day.  They are really testing my strength now, asked my 16yr old (to lighten the mood and have a giggle about it) but she ran the other way saying no way mum I couldn't hurt you, asked my husband he screwed his face up ha ha so looks like I'm gonna have to grin n bare it. DVD n PJ day for me, feeling a bit wishy washy, darling kids all at sch, darling husband at work so me n much needed peace and quiet ahhh that's just what I need. ",

I was told it was rare to have different tumours. Hope your near the end of your journey  love Sarah    ",

I've just had dose 5/6 n I've used the cold cap all the way which has saved bout half my hair. FEC-T itself does give you what they call chemo head (fuzzy brain) for a few days so u may want to write things down so you don't get stressed bout tying to remember things.  Other effects I've had are sickness sore mouth and extreme tiredness but they give u meds to help you thru theses stages. Now I'm on my last 3 doses its switched to T, which I would rate the toughest cycles because there r different effects, my mouth gets sooo sore, tastebuds change and flu like symptoms (aches n pain in joints). Painful fingernails n toenails and blurred vision.  Don't 4 get you may sail thru this n not see any of these. Every time you go for your pre-chat you MUST tell them everything you have experienced don't matter how small get as much meds as you can to help you thru. good luck, you CAN and you WILL kick ass Sarah x  ",
