I'm only 2 weeks post mastectomy and axilliary clearance but I'm booked in for my radiotherapy planning scan tomorrow. I have inflammatory breast cancer, which will roar back if it gets half a chance, so they're keen to get on with it ASAP. I'm just hoping that the fluid build-up won't cause a delay.  I'm such a Klutz! x",

      "Content": "Thanks for that Raegan Seven times!  Goodness, poor you. I've had mine done twice now but it came straight back so my feeling is that the body simply wants some fluid there at the moment.   My problem is that, having inflammatory breast cancer and a chain of lymph nodes under the muscle that was never going to be reached by the surgeon, my radiotherapy is highly time sensitive. I'm 6 weeks post chemo now and horribly aware that as soon as the cancer wakes up to the fact that the foot is no longer on its neck, it'll be up and off with all my curative treatment options now exhausted... so i'm going to have to put up with the fluid for now in the interests of keeping the area relatively stable for radiotherapy. It's the lesser of the evils I think.  I've been assured that no, it really isn't going to burst my stitches - it just feels that way.  If I'm still sloshing when the radiation is over, I'll definitely be back to the surgeon... complaining bitterly. All the best and thanks for the advice. x",

      "Content": "Hi, I've just finished six months of neoadjuvant chemo - 4 cycles of Carboplatin with weekly Taxol then 4 of EC.  I have inflammatory breast cancer for which chemo before surgery is standard.  My condition is now deemed operable (insofar as they can ever tell with IBC).  I'm booked in for Modified Radical Mastectomy this Thursday with radiotherapy to follow.   Chemo wasn't a walk in the park by any means but overall nothing like as bad as I'd expected.  The worst side effect for me was fatigue - so i just listened to my body and went with it. It's important to stay really well hydrated. Also excellent oral hygiene. I used Biotene every day and Gengigel when my mouth felt really iffy (a few days each cycle) and it worked for me. Obviously, surgery isn't a prospect to relish but I'm grateful to have 'qualified'.  I've found the month between finishing chemo and having the op the hardest to cope with psychologically - especially when my hair began to regrow.... !  Apparently this is not an uncommon reaction but it took me by surprise so I pass it on to you.

It took him a few moments to find it on the NHS approved list but it is there.  I found it to be an excellent product. I used it exactly as instructed during and after RT and had no skin problems at all.  My surgeon saw me shortly after I finished RT and she was really impressed with the healthy state of my skin.  She had never heard of R1 R2 but was keen to make a note of it.  Hope this helps.  Jo",

      "Content": "Hi. My advice - from one Joanne to another - is niche... but vital!  Don't fall asleep on the hospital loo, leap to your feet in disarray and tread on your surgical drain!  I keep trying to joke about this (and indeed, it will eventually (I hope) become hilarious).... but I am still suffering the consequences 4 months on.  It's actually really easy to do with or without a loo.  I heard of someone who lost theirs to a door handle during a party - which is more glamorous then the loo but may involve dry cleaning.... Otherwise, honestly, if you do the exercises EXACTLY as instructed - no more, no less but also listening to your body and being gentle around the limits, it's all very doable.  I had mine with mastectomy followed in short order by radiation - and despite ongoing issues from the clumsy drain incident, have full range of movement and also much more sensation in the area than was the case immediately afterwards. Also, as with every stage of treatment (and life in general) stay really well hydrated. It makes everything run more smoothly. Best of luck and all usual festive wishes x",

      "Content": "Dear Sacha, OK.  This is my very first post on any online forum ever - so I hope it helps.  First, best wishes for your results.  The really important thing is to find the right treatment plan for you.   My heart went out to you when I saw your post.  I watched my mother go through chemo back in the day and, like you, I was petrified at the thought of having it myself. However, I can say with total honesty as I near the end of a heavy 6 month regime to reduce an aggressive inflammatory breast cancer, that things have changed hugely for the better.  The list of possible side-effects is dispiriting - but if you listen to your body, manage your energy, eat well and keep yourself really well hydrated (my personal top tip!) there's no reason to expect to get them all.  Sometimes, when I think of all the symptoms that I haven't had, I even feel a little smug. Yes, it is a shock to lose your hair - so important to a woman - but many people say it grows back better than before (I'm hoping! anyway) and you may even discover that underneath your crowning glory lies a beautifully shaped head. So i'd say embrace it. It's a process - and it's temporary.  I bought a wig but hardly ever wear it. A cotton or bamboo cap combined with a beautiful scarf can be comfortable and chic. Personally, I found the eyebrows more upsetting - but there are good products out there and, after a couple of comical disasters, I found my method... This may sound strange (and some may wish to shoot me down in flames) but for me, the challenges of chemo have prompted me to slow down, reassess my priorities and pay some real attention to self-care. On chemo you have to look after your diet, your skin, your nails - to give yourself some love: if you don't, you may get ill.  It's nice - empowering even.  I would honestly say that at this moment (no hair, no eyebrows and soon - assuming things go to plan for me - no left breast) I feel more confident and more womanly than I did before Christmas when the s**t hit the fan... ...so whatever comes your way, hold your head up high and go for it!
