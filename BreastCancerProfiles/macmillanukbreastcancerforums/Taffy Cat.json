    "Content": "Hi Kim, I found my lump a week before my 40th birthday last June (2013). It was 7cms so the surgeon wanted to do chemo first to shrink it, then lumpectomy and lymph clearance. I had op Dec 16th 2013, after which the surgeon told me that there were cancer cells present in 50% of my lymph glands and in the tissue they removed to the boundaries and beyond. So she said I needed mastectomy. The tumour itself had shrunk from the chemo, down to 1cm, so it was a shock to learn that cancer cells were still present.(I had full body CT scan after and there is no evidence of any cancer tumours anywhere else in my body). I asked for a double mastectomy and I am going in to have it done end of Feb. I asked for the double because I never want to go through this journey again and it will give me peace of mind. I did this after talking it through with my family and my surgeon. I feel for me, it is worth it. Whatever you choose to do, go with whatever gives you peace and reassurance. Talking it through does help. I wish you all the very best with your chemo. x",
