      "Content": "Hi   my mouth is horrid too. It's like the roof of my mouth is burnt and my gums are wrinkly!  And that god damn awful taste!!!  I am using mouth wash & floss aswell as a lot of brushing. And food is awful, unless it's got a really strong taste.  Am loving mustard, salt & vinegar crisps, blue cheese & onion.  Also lots of juicy things like grapes and oranges.  I'm not sure what else you can actually do about it though.  Mine usually lasts for about a week after chemo & then it's my eyes that become a problem. Sorry I can't be of much help to you, but do love to have a moan!!  lol x Kate  ",

      "Content": "Hi, I had double mastectomy on Friday 20th Dec. I came home the next morning with 3 drains, 2 were removed pretty quickly but I still have the 3rd which will come out tomorrow. It's just the most awful sensation when they pull it out, I did try coughing like suggested but ended up yelling as it snaked its way through me, not because of pain but just the sensation!!! Gross. I've managed to get by by just using paracetamol and ibuprofen so far and hope to continue that way. Mentally....I've had a few wobbles but hey ho. Not liking getting dressed because while the drain is still in I can't wear a bra to put my softies in & although all my friends know what I've had done, I will feel more confident in myself if my clothes fit me better and look more feminine, especially as I have on a couple of cms of hair. My family and friends are truly wonderful and make this all much easier to deal with. I hope u all are having lovely Christmas's and 2014 is a better year for us all. Xxx Kate",

Was at hospital for 9:00 & had to have a metal clip inserted in to my lump (which is over an inch in size) so they know where it is. Then had to have a bone scan which was an injection followed by a 3 hour wait, so in those 3 hrs I went for a ct scan which involved a lot of liqued being drunk then another injection whilst being scanned & then back to bone scan dept for the scan.  I came out and cried like a baby all the way home.  I think it's been building up for a few days and today was the day it all boiled over.  Feel miserable and exhausted now & can't even get too close to my boys as I too radioactive! ! Got the rest of the week to myself and start chemo on Tuesday. Petrified! !",

Oh just to let u know, I had double mx and lymph node clearance in December after all the chemo etc I couldn't have immediate reconstruction. And my expanders will be temp ones. I'm so looking forward to it. The whole 'C' thing almost felt like it happened to a different person, but then when u r going through it u feel completely different from anyone else. I have a good head of hair now, which looks like I just have short hair rather than \"I've been poorly\" hair and getting some boobies back is another door shut on that whole episode and getting me back to me again. For a long time I could never imagine being 'mentally' where I am now. It was my 40th birthday on Tuesday just gone.......it felt wonderful to have been given the chance to be 40!!! I'm now looking forward to the next decade. Be strong pink sisters xxx",

      "Content": "Hi everyone Just wanted to let u know I finally went for it... my hubby shaved my head yesterday! ! It's actually been quite a relief.  For weeks now I've been gradually going from long thick lovely hair to shorter and shorter and thinner and thinner, until it just looked awful and patchy. It was traumatic actually doing it but it's done now. I was just dragging out the inevitable.  My scalp is super white apart from a brown tan line where my parting used to be & I wasn't sure where to end my foundation!  Within the hour I was in sainsburys buying pink tops. People did stare & I had to resist the urge to glare back at them. Then went to our local pub and introduced everyone to my new look. They were all really sweet & reassuring.  The landlord even laughed at me, which I didn't mind as it was a genuine reaction.  It does feel strange though,  I can feel all the tiny breezes like little tickly bugs & it felt very strange on my pillow last night.  I did find myself automatically reaching for my brush this morning.  Anyway, its one less thing to be worried about now. So if any of u are deciding whether to take the plunge then GO FOR IT!!! Love to u all xx Kate",

      "Content": "Hi Diane Congratulations on your plunge!!!  You have put a smile on my face knowing I was not alone that day, coz you feel like your alone. My kids think it's great and keep touching it all the time.   I have one wig already & am waiting for 2 more to be delivered.  I don't know if it's the same where you are but we get to choose 3 but keep 1.  Anyway the one I have at the moment is bloody awful, so I'm not really counting on the other 2 being much better.  The scarf look isn't really doing it for me either, so I think I'll just be Katie K rather than Jessie J.  Am so hoping the eyebrows and lashes don't do a disappearing act.  My eyebrows no longer need plucking and a few of my eye lashes have sort of done a 360 and keep poking me in the eye.  I can handle thinning but think I'll look horrific with a totally hair free bonce & face.   As for the constipation  - well I think I have mastered it now.  Lactulose from the day after chemo & 1 x senna tablet the first night after chemo for 3/4 days.  God after my first chemo I didn't go until day 6.  I was in agony, it was like being in labour but with no gas and air (mind you I did have plenty of gas).  At one point I was crawling across the living room floor coz my tummy was so cramped I just couldn't stand up.  I also spent so long sat on the loo that I had 2 bruises across the back of my legs from the loo seat!!!   Anyway I don't really care about any of it so long as it kicks the sh*t out of the cancer.   I'd better go now, my 3 boys are bellowing at me for something or other & the dog is shaking because of the thunder! It was lovely to hear from you.   Take care xx much love Kate",
