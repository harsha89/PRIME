      "Content": "Hi Fiz, My mum has just recovered from Pneumonia and is now home. She had to go into CCU as she needed a one to one nurse and the Haemotology ward couldn't give her that. She was struggling with Oxygen as her lungs stuck together with the infection. She had to have nebuliser treatment 2-3 times a day for well over a week, and with the help of that and the oxygen mask, she overcame it. She also struggled to eat and for days had only water, and build up drinks. Then they put a pipe through her nose into her stomach so they could feed her. Mum can't remember much about that period and was very disallusioned. Not sure if the chemo can give you Pneumonia or not. I would probably say it's because the immune system is at rock bottom whilst having chemo, that infections can be caught. Mum is at home now as she has built up her white blood cells/immune system and is getting stronger everyday. She is to have a lower dosage of chemo in Jan via Injections. Could you have a word with her doctor about leaving the chemo alone for a bit whilst she gets the chance to recover and build up some strength? I hope she gets rid of it soon and can start to eat and drink again. I will keep my fingers crossed for you, and your mum xx",

      "Content": "I read somewhere that people have Ice Pops then at least the chemo doesn't burn the mouth, tongue etc, and gets rid of the nasty taste. Also Jelly & ice Cream My mum has been drinking Ginger Beer or Blackcurrant Cordial as that tastes ok, and eating Muller Light yoghurts. She can't eat much for the same reason, but there are little things day by day which get better tasting. Hope you can rid of the nasty taste soon xx",
