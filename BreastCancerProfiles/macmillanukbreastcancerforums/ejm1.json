      "Content": "Hello  It's a scary time when you are first diagnosed .. Sorry to hear it feels like a terrifying nightmare   I was diagnosed with BC in my right breast back in April 2015 and it took a good few weeks to conclude that my left breast was ok .. Scans, MRI, numerous biopsies .. The waiting was horrid - I always knew I'd need a mx and at first wanted a double - my attitude was 'take both off' but the more I reflected on it I begun to think differently and had a single with immediate reconstruction in Nov  Your mammogram worked in that it spotted the clacification which led to further exploration - which 'caught'the cancer and has led to treatment which should be effective  Your scan was clear in regards to your other organs which is good news  It must be hard to have gone back for more than one surgery and still be told you need a MX - has that doubted your confidence in the dr's/medical systems ability to accurately predict / detect any worries with your unaffected breast? You say your family want you to have a double and whilst I'm sure their views are important, ultimately it's your decisions .. For me it came down to being calmed somewhat by Dr's in regards to liklihood of occurance as well as concluding that I wanted one breast that 'worked' - I'm only 44  Will you be on any long term treatment that will reduce chances of reoccurrence?  There was another recent thread about a very similar issue with a lot of info and experiences shared .. You might find it useful to have a read of that  What ever you decide will be right for you - you know your body and your mind better than anyone else, take some time to explore the options and talk through ... Maybe with an inpartial person - isyour BCN being supportive ?  I wish you well for the future  Ellen x ",

      "Content": "Hello tsmith Thought I'd share my experience as it sounds similar in some ways to your sister in laws  I was diagnosed with HER+ grade 2 invasive BC in April 15 - it had begun life as dcis and my senital lymph node was positive following biopsy. The principal tumour was 7 cm and there were spots of calcification in other parts of the breast, which indicated pre cancerous changes. I also had pagets which is a relatively rare form of nipple cancer.  I was 44 so a bit older that your sister in law and the future children / fertility questions were not an issue for me  I had chemo first then surgery, which is called neoadjuvant treatment - this is common in the UK for this type of cancer  - no chemo isn't nice, but I coped and worked through most of it with a few days off after each cycle and shorter working hours, I was very tired by the end and then had time to get strong again before surgery   Even though my tumour shrank to nothing I always knew that I'd need a mastectomy as my doctor explained that as there were multiple worrying bits of the breast I'd wind up looking like Swiss cheese is she tried to remove them all I had a very good response to the chemo - what is called a pathological complete response, there was no cancer left in any part of the nipple, breast or lymph nodes (11 removed) - its only by having the chemo first can this be measured, and therefore I know that my chances of reoccurring are greatly reduced. I find out next week if I need radiotherapy - my surgeon thinks probably not, again this is only possible if you have the chemo before surgery I started herceptin halfway through chemo and will carry that on for a full 12 months - my oncologist explained that for HER+ tumours herceptin is a game changer, and in the UK you can't have that without the chemo as that is where it is most effective  I hope some of this info helps - there are good effective treatments for HER+ cancers, with increasingly positive outcomes - this is what your sister in law and the family must hold on to, even though it's incredibly scary at this early stage  Take care Ellen x",

      "Content": "Hello Naz  I had this surgery in November '15 almost twelve weeks ago, mx on my right breast and immediate reconstruction after 6 rounds of chemo, I also had node clearance .. They took 11. I was due to have the diep procedure but once the surgery was underway they couldn't find good enough veins (chemo complication) so I wound up having tram - meaning they take some abdominal muscle. My op took over 11 hours and I needed blood transfusions the following day as my hb was low after the chemo  The first thing I would say is be prepared for serious pain in the tummy area and a slow recovery ... Your tummy feels incredibly 'tight' necessitating you walking in a bit of a stooped over way for a few weeks but this does ease. I felt like I'd been run over by a juggernaut, then a bus, then car ! Despite feeling like this I was out of bed on day two and within 2-3 weeks able to do moderate amounts of walking of up to 45 mins - but slowly. 8 weeks on I could drive, do a long 1 1/2 hour walk on news year day and now physicallyfeel about 80%. No pain, but still some discomfort and twinges and you have to do the exercises ... I'm thinking of starting some gentle Pilates in a couple more weeks to build up stomach strength again.  In terms of new boob - I would say 'work in progress' , but generally good. It was very swollen to start with (I also got a seroma and then an infection  but I think I was unlucky ... Both now clearedand all healed up). The good bit is it is made of me, it's warm and it's starting to take on the shape of the other boob - ie bit of natural droop. If you're having both done then it might be easier to get symmetry ... Certainly over clothes you couldn't tell the difference between mine. It will need further 'tweaking' - probably some liposuction to shape it more like the other as it's actually bigger, but hopefully it will reduce some more after radiotherapy that starts soon. Stomach scar wise I'm not that bothered .. Yes it's long but below bikini line(not that I'm a bikini wearer) and is already starting to fade - get some bio oil and check with nurses when its ok to start using  and my new tummy button looks good .. My stomach is also very flat as you effectively have a tummy tuck.  At the end of the day you'll make the right decision for you - for me it came down to being 44 and wanting a new boob that was a natural as possible and would last me without having to have it changed, re-filled etc...as can happen with implants - to be honest the first few weeks after surgery I wished I'd gone for the implant as I found the stomach surgery very hard - i am pretty active person who rode my bike every day and found the recovery process hard - but now as I'm getting back to full activity I'm more positive about it, I'm sure it's because the memory of the pain is starting to fade as well  I hope that's helpful - it's wound up being a long reply ! if you have any more specific questions feel free to ask and I really hope that what ever surgery you decide on goes well for you  Take care Ellen x ",

      "Content": "Hi Naz  Re feeling -no do not have proper sensation, have some feeling on the top part of new boob, but can't feel about 70% and there is also reduced feeling in the tummy where nerves have been cut  I'd agree Marcia in saying that pain began to reduce after about 2-3 weeks and then after about 6-7 moved to discomfort, which I still have at times  also like Marcia I have never felt pain like it, hospital was pretty horrid and  was utterly shattered as they wake you every hour to check the new boob for the first 72 hours so was a complete mess of pain, tiredness and drugs - was also pretty tearful which I think was a combination of everything - if you've just finished chemo your physical and emotional resilience is probably diminished ... Mine certain wax  I also hadn't properly appreciated that I'd need further 'tweaking surgery' after, so had to get my head round that Am I pleased I chose this option? Increasingly so, though if you'd asked me that immediately afterwards or in the first 6 weeks I'd have said no ",

Then we can agree treatment etc ... But it's certainly going to include surgery and chemo though not necessarily in that order I actually found this thread yesterday morning as I was preparing myself to go and get the results which I was pretty sure we're going to be bad news ... I have so many questions right now and am not used to not being in control of things so it's going to be tough ... But it's been great to read and hear from so many people that there is light in what feels like a very long tunnel - I too really love the phrase 'treated to recovery' - am going to hold on to that and the wonderful and encouraging stories from so many of you im trying to decide what to do over the next couple of weeks in terms of work before I start treatment - do I keep on going? I think the routine will be good for me and whilst I'm a bit of a mess emotionally physically I'm fine, in fact I'm fitter now than I have been in years and on 2 weeks am supposed to be going on a 250 mile cycle trip round the outer Hebrides with my brother ... We cycled to Paris last year - if the doctor says it ok and delaying treatment for a week or so isn't problematic I'm tempted to still go as I think it'll be good for my soul  I have a great partner who I know is going to my rock over the coming months ...

Maybe chemo or radiotherapy?  And yes the anxiety of not knowing is the worst bit - but did a 25 mile bike ride this morning and the sun is shining and I'm off to the theatre later, so hey ho, life goes on ... Hope your treatment  over the past year has gone well and you are coming out the other side  ellen x",

      "Content": "Hi nix You are right the recovery for diep recon is pretty long, I had mine early Nov - it hurt like hell and I was a bit of a mess, physically and emotionally for a few weeks after. My op took 12 hours and was only 6 weeks after I finished chemo so needed blood transfusions. They wake you up every hour for the first 48-72 hours to check the blood flow so I was also deranged through lack of sleep!!  To be honest for the first few weeks I regretted it - my new boob wasn't what I thought it was be, it was hugely swollen, I got an infection and then had a seroma which meant I needed to get the fluid drawn out by needle. It meant I had to go to the dressing clinic almost every day for a month. My tummy was incredibly painful as well as being numb where they cut the nerves - a contradiction I know. You are kind of bent over whilst your tummy stretches out and do a weird shuffle walk but that got a lot better by week 6 Now 5 months on I'm increasingly pleased with it, it's starting to look and behave like a boob, it's warm, flops naturally at night etc... is part of me and not plastic and silicon which is important to me. Hopefully it will last me forever without the need for any more major surgery though I might have some small alterations as its actually bigger than my other one and my surgeon has said they can liposuction it to make it a better match.  Recovery has been slow but steady, i made myself go out everyday, even if just for walk round the block a few times. I was back at work after about 3 months and am now able to ride my bike the 5 miles each way. I still have some soreness/discomfort in my tummy but it's getting better each week and I started yoga after 12 weeks to help re-build core muscles. To be honest one of the worst bits post surgery has been cording in my arm after the lymph node removal - but Physio has helped with that, and it is nothing to do with the diep. There's been a few threads in here recently about diep recon you might want to look up  - some people very positive others have had more complicated experiences ..  I'd be happy to send you a picture in private message if you would like  Hope that helps  Ellen x ",

It  took a good few months, about 3, till I had a proper covering but now almost 6 months on from last chemo and just booked haircut number 2 ... The sides and back have grown faster than the top so needed a little trim to tidy it up  My eye lashes and brows grew back really quickly though ..

      "Content": "Hello lujay It's good that you have found this site to help answer questions and provide support at this difficult time  I finished chemo in sep '15, started off on FEC but after the first 2 rounds the oncologists dropped the F and I had just EC, flowed by 3 T. Apparently this is becoming more common and I know some people who have been given EC from the start. My team explained that there is research into the effectiveness of F and that the indicators are that for many EC is just as effective with fewer side effects  I had neoadjuvant chemo (ie before surgery) and it was very effective with no cancer found in any tissue or lymph nodes post surgery - When I was diagnosed back in April had a 7 cm grade 2 tumour, plus other spots of calcification and my senital node was positive.  I know I have been lucky that the treatment has been so effective.  I really hope you also have a good response and the chemo isn't too rough on you.  Take care Ellen ",

I was back at work by the time I had radio and worked through that with a couple of weeks off after to sleep - 4 weeks on I am now back in every day but trying to do two short days a week  You've got to do what works for you and listen to  your body, work was important for me as it gave me a sense of control over my life when everything else felt out of control, and my brain was turningto mush with all the day time tv!!  but everyone is different and you shouldn't feel pressured to do anything that doesn't feel right for you, and things may change ...

What do your dr's / BCN say ?  There are other people in this site who have been away but it's a personal decision and everyone's different - for me it was important to lik after my emotional health as well as physical and the trip helped  Hope the rest if your treatment goes well and you get to enjoy your trip - sooner or later it will still feel great  Take care  Ellen ",
