    "Content": "Hi Rach, I finished Chemo 6 weeks ago and have the same problem in my right inner lower arm. It happened approx. 5 months earlier when the nurse put he canular in and missed the vein therefore the red fluid seeped out until I told her and t was stopped. I have been told by my GP, Oncologist and the man doing regular Ultra Sounds on it that I will have it for life. The worst thing is that now I am off Chemo it seems to be getting worse quickly and also is very painful with stabbing pains",
