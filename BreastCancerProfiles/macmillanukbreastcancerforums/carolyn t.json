      "Content": "Hi, I had taxol for ovca. (as well as carboplatin IP) The taxol however is the one I had the most effects from..I lost all my hair starting after the 2nd treatment. It's just growing back now 8 weeks after finishing chemo (about 1/2' on my head, and I have new eyebrows and eyelashes..better than before!) I started out feeling good for the first day or two after treatment, but by the third day the nausea and bone/muscle aches and pains set in, lasting usually about 4 days..requiring heat pads and some digesics. I started acupuncture for the nausea and that seemed to help, as I no longer required any nausea meds for the rest of the treatments. I did however find the numbness in the feet and fingers the worst. My fingers are getting better now but from the balls of my feet to my toes are still really numb all the time. I've been told this can take up to 12 months to get better. I also found I had the terrible metallic taste..ate pineapple and fruit iceblocks, and added a few extra spices to make food taste a bit better...oh, and using plastic cutlery helped too. Good luck with your treatment, hope this helps luv Carolyn x",

      "Content": "So sorry to hear your bone scan results, you must be shocked. I hope the results of your brain scan are ok. I'll keep my fingers crossed for you. I had 'drop' sessions too after the first few chemos, but I put this down to absolute exhaustion, and therefore a side effect of the chemo. I've just had chemo 6 for ovarian ca, and still do sometimes get a bit dizzy if i move or turn too quickly, but don't suffer the extreme exhaustion I did in the beginning..probably because I was post op as well. Thankyou for letting everyone know the possibility of something more serious perhaps going on, as sometimes I think we blame the effects of chemo too soon and not explore all the possible causes. Sometimes too the dr's are quick to pass off such symptoms as a part of the process of chemo. I wish you all the very best with your treatment, and hope you can let us know how you get on. It is so thoughtful of you to post when you obviously have so much on your mind. Let us know if we can help, Take care and lots luv...Carolyn x",
