Where are you?. I assume they would fill the area up with your own fat? Or you may have to live with this. My boob still feels very foreign to me still. Xxx",

I was in hospital with an infection in my new boob and that knocked me for six. My wound is still getting dressed weekly. Also a couple of seromas too!! It's a big op. My surgeon said when we do the nipple and other breast (uplift)  he could do lippo suction on my  other side  so it would match the less fatty operated side up. Please feel free to ask me anything if you think I could help. Big hug xx",

Your surgeon should explain what is suitable. I have found it hard to adjust to my faux boob I call it! I had recon straight away using back muscle. Looks good but find the tightness under my arm where the muscle and blood supply pulled through a strange feeling. 10 weeks post op.
