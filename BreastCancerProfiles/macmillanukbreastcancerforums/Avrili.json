      "Content": "Hi Ladies I\u2019m new to this forum thingy but it has helped me a lot to see that I\u2019m not the only woman who can\u2019t decide what to do for the best. To decide whether to ask if they would consider performing a bilateral mastectomy as I worry so much about the awful disease. I\u2019m so scared it will come back. It haunts me yet I get so cross with myself for being so weak. I have recently had my reconstruction operation on the breast that had cancer in it. This seems to have gone well I think I hope. So why for some reason do I feel like I need to decide on the healthy breast? Logically why would I want to remove healthy tissue? I don\u2019t have the BRACA gene so why do I constantly think about removing the healthy breast?  Am i going crazy? Can anyone who f els ike this please let me know. I\u2019m even afraid that taking the other breast away may cause me to get cancer elsewhere. I know that I\u2019m being totally illogical & silly but I am so petrified of this awful disease. I want to be brave & positive like lots of other women who have gone through this or even worse situations & they are so courageous. I feel like a wimp. I just want to hear what other women have decided upon when they are in the same position as me. X",
