      "Content": "Hi Sept78 and Mrs50,  I had my last chemo on 1st Nov, and am now 3/4 of the way through radiotherapy.  The chemo already seems like a crazy dream! I had one FEC without a PICC line and got sore veins like yourselves. I then asked for a PICC line and used it for the other 5 chemo doses (2 x FEC and 2 x Docetaxel).  My chemo unit were very happy to organise that.  Having had surgery first I only had one arm they could use for chemo.  For me there were pros and cons with the PICC line, but I didn't have any hospital issues.  It did completely save my veins from any further damage and of course comes into its own on chemo day, which gives some peace of mind!  For me the disadvantages were: It restricted what I did physically during the months of chemo because I was worried about dislodging the line or causing bleeding.  I was told no vacuuming, no ironing, no swimming etc.  So I stopped all my exercising except walking for the months of the chemo, even the good weeks.  (Mind you, I think I could have been more gung ho, and you can't go swimming or to exercise classes anyway most of the time, due to risk of infections.)  Having to go into the chemo ward every week to have the PICC line flushed and dressing changed. That's lots of extra visits. Difficult to bathe or shower. It's not a great summer look! But if I had to have chemo again I would get a PICC line again.  Although on the anti-PICC front, the vein damage I got from the one FEC went away after a few weeks without any creams.  So maybe if you have two arms to use you could alternate them, to give the veins 6 weeks to recover. Sorry that's a mixed review from me! Very best of luck with your chemo experience! best wishes, Betty xxx",

I haven't posted many walks so far because I don't remember to take any photos - but will make more of an effort in January.  Rest assured I have been walking! I normally do one short and one long dog walk a day, plus a 30 min fast walk without the dogs.   The walking does make a big difference to my energy levels, mood and health. Today I walked up 6 floors of stairs at the hospital because the one working lift was being so slow.  Had to stop half way - I am totally out of practice!  But there was a lovely view from the Chemo unit while I was having my Herceptin and Zolendronic acid love Betty xxx",

Whereas if you don\u2019t take the chemo and then the cancer does return you might regret not trying it.  There are people in this forum who are in that category too.  Best of luck with your decision, Betty xxx",

      "Content": "Hi all, So, I'm on my second chemo dose, and day 2 I was very fuzzy headed and spent most of the day resting in bed, but did liven up a bit in the evening.  Not vomited this time, perhaps due to the 4 different anti-sickness pills I'm now prescribed. I unfortunately did forget one pill yesterday, and missed one today (day 3) as ended up on an extended wig shopping trip without them, but hopefully the other pills will pull me through.  Went bright red and also started the white blood cell boosting injections today, which I hate, and due to a prescription error I need to go back to the hospital to get 2 more by Wednesday - I really do! Rashly have bought a cavapoo puppy that we're collecting tomorrow, as it seems like a good time overall to train up a new puppy while I'm home most of the time for 6 or 7 months on chemo and radiotherapy.  Slightly concerned about how tiring it'll be when I'm under the influence of the chemo, but my eldest daughter has offered to do the overnight and early morning shifts and is off school for 6 weeks soon, plus other daughter and hubbie will be able to help in the evenings and weekends. We have an elderly cavalier dog, who I suspect will be trying to train the puppy to leave him alone.  All this dog activity will be a good distraction for me hopefully. Hang in there chemo buddies, we will get through this. love and hugs, Betty xxx",

I\u2019m constantly adjusting the bandages to try to make it more comfortable and I would be a lot more active with that arm if I wasn\u2019t worried about the PICC line coming out or bleeding.  But it will come into its own next week for the cycle 3 blood test and chemo next week!

I\u2019m on EC for 3 x 3 week cycles, then Doxetaxel 3  x 3 week cycles in parallel with Herceptin for 18 x 3 weeks.  I was diagnosed on 3rd May with a 17mm IDC, and had WLE and SNB surgery on 10th May to remove it. I\u2019m grade 3, triple positive, but it hadn\u2019t reached the lymph nodes.  So my hair hasn\u2019t started falling out yet, but I\u2019ve been busy stocking up on scarves, hats and wigs ready because I hear it might start tomorrow! I\u2019m getting a PICC line put in on 11th as I\u2019ve seen such rave reviews for them on this site and I wasn\u2019t offered a port.  My hand and arm veins really struggled with the first chemo dose, and I needed needles again the next day for blood tests, anti sickness and saline drip, so I decided it\u2019ll be worth the PICC line in the long run. My hospital isn\u2019t too far away to go back every week to have it flushed and redressed.  I didn\u2019t fancy the cold cap having seen a video of it and because it seems to have a low chance of fully working.  And I\u2019m also preoccupied about diet, and have shopped for a Mediterranean diet this week. So many fruit and veg I couldn\u2019t fit them all in the fridge . Take care everyone, and stay strong. Liz x",

      "Content": "Maggie-Gaudigirl, it sounds like its all happening really fast for you, although in some ways that's good - at least you're not sitting around waiting. It took me a few weeks to come to terms with my diagnosis as it all happened so fast.  On the one hand you do know its really happening, and on the other hand you don't really believe it! Good luck for this week's appointments.  It helps me to just think very short term when I can, so as not to get swamped by all the stages and future appointments at once. take care, Betty xxx",

      "Content": "The same happened to me - I too was surprised when the radiographer said I had clips marking where my tumour was which were put in during the surgery. Nobody told me that! I also asked if they\u2019d set off security scanners at airports but apparently not ! My radiotherapy update is that I\u2019ve done my planning session, although they couldn\u2019t plan the boost treatment as my oncologist couldn\u2019t make it.  I think because of that the radiotherapy start date has now been moved a week to 28th Nov. So I have my penultimate session on Christmas Eve and then the last one on day after Boxing Day. I\u2019m lucky to have found out that the dates moved, it was only because I happened to phone them to check some appointment times ! I\u2019m all set with Aveeno cream, and have been tattooed.  I\u2019m off to Cornwall tomorrow for a few days for a quick holiday before the radiotherapy starts. Should be really nice . take care everyone,  Betty xxx",
