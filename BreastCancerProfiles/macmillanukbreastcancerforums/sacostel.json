      "Content": "Hello everyone. This is my first post although i have been following a lot of your posts overthe past few weeks with interest. I was diagnosed mid january with dcis +invasive within (whatever the latter means). I have now had two operations to remove the lump (plus some) and sentinel node biopsy. This was after 2 quite painful biopsies and wire localisation which hurt like hell....i actually felt sorry for the radiographer in the end because i cried so much with the pain. Following the first op, my boob got infected and it had to be aspirated. Â That hole healed almost immediately and it started pouring out of my scar a day later. Apparently i had cellulitus and although the infection has now been removed during my 2nd op, the skin on my boob is dry, firm, extremely itchy and sore. I am wondering if anyone has any ideas please on what i can put on it? The plaster only came off today (op 2 was last weds). Thank you for listening.......xx",
