    "Content": "This is my first post on this site but I have been following various discussions. I can't help with the Anastrazole  brands but I am interested in this disussion.   I have been through chemo/lumpectomy and rads and was about to start Anastrazole. I was already concerned about side effects but it' s even worse now as my DEXA scan showed I have borderline osteoporosis. My oncologist informed me of this and gave me prescription for ADCal and Alendronic Acid tablets but did not give me any information or go into any details.   I was in shock at this diagnosis and until I collected the tablets and read up on this, I was not in a position to ask anything.  I have seen my GP as I  have a lot of concerns about the treatments & possible side effects but she was not able to answer my questions. I am trying to obtain my DEXA  report from  my oncologist (it was not passed to my GP)and I will be referred to an osteoporosis specialist in 6 - 8 weeks. It seems that the anastrazole tablets can cause lots of problems with joints and the idea of taking them for 5 years is really off putting, especially with a bone problem.  Has anyone else had a similar experience and been taking anastrazoleand Alendronic acid tablets?      ",
