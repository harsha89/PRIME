      "Content": "hi peterawake yes, the lymph node one was 4mm, almost half the size of the node (9mm) so I thought quite big.... and never detected beforehand which was surprising since it was checked twice by ultrasound. The tumour removed was 18mm, initially diagnosed as 14mm but due to no clear margins it was further excised. My surgeon mentioned he managed to find only one other sentinel node and that one was clear. I had surgery in February last year and still have a green tinge in the bottom half of my breast, so I guess that indeed I do have fewer nodes to remove the invasive dye... I am not sure if that is good or bad as any cancer cells have to go somewhere, but I rather not think about that. I asked about chemo at the time but they said there was no real benefit to me, although as my treatment developed they also changed their mind about booster radiation sessions. Initially I was to get 4, but these were cancelled as again, they felt I would not benefit based on where the original tumour was (against my skin) and so in effect it could not further spread, so to speak. I had 8/8 Estroegen and 6/6 Progestron, so really at the tip of the scale so I am guessing that the letrozole + radiation will do the trick. What scares me is what will happen 10 years down the line as this type of cancer seems to lie dormant for a long time...\\ GC",

I have had horrendous side effects these past 5 days, it is quite debilitating... anyone else had that experience? I am analyzing the ingredients of each; it seems the film coating is quite different... I am not sure if I just had a bad time in general and felt awful, or indeed it was CIPLA to blame... I also asked Femara as I heard that was best, but my GP would not prescribe it saying it costs an extra £900 a year.... I think it is terrible we have no choice in these matters and must plea all the time to get something which ultimately will affect me for the next 10 years... Anyway, just wondered if anyone else felt the same. GC",

Amazing there is so much research but nothing on SE.... I have been on letrozole for 10 months now, not that long of course, but with plenty of ups and downs for SE I had to make a fuss at my chemist about 6 months ago and eventually my GP agreed to specify 'accord' and SE seem reasonable now but still having bad fatigue. The last time however, after the femara 'rejection', my GP just sent a prescription and I ended up getting Cipla.I thought I would give it a go but it is hell I am not a chemist but thought I would check on the ingredients,  It is baffling that such minute differences can have such massive effects.  My oncologist said for me I would be  on it for 10 years, I was told I could stop a few months and see how things settle down. Apparently a break is fine. But stopping also freaks me out... Thanks for all your supporting comments, it means a lot to me. GC",

I just wanted to see if indeed it was Cipla and nothing else. If it is Cipla then I will re-order Accord only. I do hope it is available, a bit worrying you think it might not be... My BCN mentioned to me that the hospital can insist on specific prescriptions at my GP, including femara as the hospital believe it is better for me to be reassured and take it for 10 years compared to me stopping and then running the risk of recurrence. In the end it is all down to cost... I think I have taken teva just once in the 10 months but at the time I had 3 different brands in a row, no wonder it caused havoc in my system... Yes, getting Macmillan involved would be great. It is so hard to endure this for such a very long time. We go through surgery, radiotherapy (I did not have chemo) and after a few months, everything is 'back to normal'. But I think with letrozole nothing is quite normal. It is such a challenging drug with so many SE and so many women having different reactions.... Sending you a big hug. GC",

      "Content": "I initially had 4 booster sessions planned which were then to my surprise (and worry) cancelled. I was told that my high grade DCIS, which was 2mm in size, was initially identified as being located outside the invasive cancer tumor, an analysis based on the lumpectomy biopsy report. But after further review, the oncology team then considered the DCIS within the same invasive tumor area, a total of 18mm. The margin was close for the side of the DCIS, but because the location was next to my skin, they were satisfied that the cancer cells could not spread further in that particular location and therefore the tumor bed did not need a boost. Another main reason for having a booster is age. If you are less than 50 you will usually get a booster in order to reduce the risk of recurrence later on (I am 56). I had a grade 2, stage I cancer, ER+ and PR+ but HER2-. I had 1/2 positive node and now having extensive RT... I do think it is all very confusing ... it took me quite a few attempts at getting the info clarified. GC",

When I arrived at the Western General in Edinburgh for my radiotherapy I got a bag with the following + instructions: (1) twice a day Zerobase emollient cream (=Diprobase moisturising cream, it comes in 500 gms dispensing tub) (2) once day in the evening a thin application of Betnovate cream (=Betamethasone steroid cream 0.1%) as a preventive measure in case any skin goes infected (100 gms tube) I am today on session 13 (lucky 13 :) ) and so far so good. My skin hardly shows any sign, just a wee glow around my neck which the RT nurse says is very common. I was quite anxious getting rashes and blisters as my skin always burns in the sun and goes very patchy but now at least it seems fine.... I would certainly recommend this cream and might be easier to get it on prescription? GC",

I am still getting used to the idea of having the breast cancer, seems all surreal, with 3 weeks between diagnosis and surgery. It would be nice to meet up, just let me know. I live in west Edinburgh and pretty flexible at the moment. GC",

I don't have any family nearby and although most of my friends know about my breast cancer (I only found out myself just over 4 weeks ago) , many work and it would be good to make new friends to have a laugh, and a cry no doubt. I live in the city and work at the University. Any suggestions welcome!",

      "Content": "Hi 'Edinburgh group' I did some research and there is a group listed on the Macmillan map and it's called Reach for Recovery. It is based at the Western General Hospital but it seems more a support group for new patients who are attending hospital. It has been going for 30 years but at the moment they are waiting on PVG clearance and are not open. I have arranged to have coffee tomorrow with one of the volunteers to find out what plans they have. It would be good to have some sort of a social get together if anyone else is interested? I live in North West Edinburgh/Drum Brae and the local new library does Macmillan coffee mornings. The bus route 26 stops outside the library and this bus has an excellent service incl Haymarket and Princes Street. There are also plenty of parking spaces nearby. I can make an inquiry at the library if there was a chance to meet there. I could find out if a morning during the week would be feasable. I do intend to go back to work soon, I cannot afford not to, so any suggestions are welcome, including a weekend group which may well be more convenient? Say at saturday at 11.00? Or we could have floating days and plan just the dates, and depending who can make it choose different locations? There are plenty of coffee shops who would welcome us. It would be great to meet up. I have no family here and it can be pretty lonely....My husband and kids are great, but don't want to bore them and also share too many anxieties in case they worry... Thanks GC",

I never felt anything and before I realised I got the cancer confirmation and a lumpectomy on Valentine's day. The surgery was standard procedure and I was a day patient taken home in the evening.... I am now recovering, only day 2... I don't feel sore at all... I took just a few pain killers yesterday  but now hardly feel anything..... BUT it feels numb... under my arm and bottom and front side of my boop.. My left arm has a constant tingling sensation, like pins and needles but not as bad....I had some nodes removed which seems standard procedure. My cancer was very small and they used a wire for assisting the surgery procedure. Has anyone had a similar experience? ",

I am not sure if I will keep in that group. FB does not have the capacity to direct threads, all very linear, no tags, no groups. Cancer for me was so totally unexpected, I don't feel ill. And never thought I would get it.... Sometimes I think it is just not me, but alas, I have seen the high res images, and I could see the cells myself. One day at the time and hopefully in the end I will beat it. ",

The surgeon could only find just one other node but fortunately that one was clear.I was told that chemo would not give any benefit as there are too many side effects that outweigh the risks. You can check the predict tool, and vary the different options. I thought it was quite useful but ultimately it very difficult to get a definite answer....https://predict.nhs.uk/index.htmlI had radiotherapy and then now on letrozole tablets, plus 6 monthly bisphosphonates.

I guess I was looking for reassurances of those that have switched medication. My BCN mentioned it happens a lot so hoping someone will respond saying they have switched and it improved My side effects were increasing though in these last few weeks, as if my body really did not want it. I know one can argue if that is the case it must work well, but having to deal with this for maybe another 9 years and 5 months seems hard.... I work fulltime and these last few weeks have been a nightmare with fatigue and painful joints, muscles, bones, knees and fingers. I can take painkillers but it seems to me that also has a risk in the longterm. I am signed off work for the moment, the first since my surgery and I don't think I can keep a FT job like this, so willing to try out something else for the sake of improving the longterm prospects. But as I said I feel quite anxious now, perhaps I should just stick it out. GC",

In the end I decided to go back to letrozole after stopping for just 2 days....  I was just too scared to stop taking it. Strangely my symptoms did improve.

As I have my first scan since diagnosis coming up soon, I thought I wait to see what comes out of that. Anyway, that's what I am thinking just now.
