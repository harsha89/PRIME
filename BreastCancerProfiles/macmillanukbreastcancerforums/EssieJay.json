      "Content": "Hi Millie63 I know exactly what you mean about the waiting!  It's excruciating.  I too am waiting for an Oncotype-Dx test result.  My breast surgeon told me it would take 2-3 weeks for the result to come through.  It may depend on where in the country you are to how long it takes to come through.  I just keep telling myself that I would rather they take a good look at everything and give me a complete picture than rush it through and make mistakes. Dreamthief linked me a great page about about the Oncotype-Dx test.  If you google search it it's on the Breast Cancer Care site (I can't figure out how to do a hyperlink!!).  It was very informative (my surgeon wasn't) about who is offered the test and what the implications are.  It's tough if you weren't told about it at your results appt, but as others have said it will give you a more personal, tailor-made treatment plan. Hugs ",

      "Content": "Hi Kate I had surgery on 28th Sept to remove the lump and the Sentinel Lymph Node for biopsy.  At my results appt I was told that it's stage 3, ER+ (I can have Tamoxifen), HER2-ve with vascular invasion, no lymph node involvement.  I'm waiting to see the Oncologist at the moment to decide if I need chemo before having radiotherapy (they are running an Oncotype-Dx test to determine possibility of spread). I read your profile - it sounds like you have been through the wringer yourself recently.  I'm not surprised you are worried about finding this lump and the implications that may or may not be linked to it. I have a good support network thanks, and they have been a life line to me these last few weeks. My hubby has just gone away for 10 days as there are no appts looming at the moment so it feels a bit weird around here.  My 11yr old keeps me on my toes though.",

      "Content": "Hi Kate Yes, I feel my journey has mostly been about waiting - for initial results, for the op, for the path results after the op and now for the Oncotype-Dx results and an appt with the Oncologist!  I'm not a patient person and am finding it very trying. I hope your weekend has not been too stressful.  Just wanted to send my best wishes for tomorrow.  ",

      "Content": "Hi, I was referred to our one-stop in clinic in August.  It was a very similar experience to what has already been described by others, but there were some differences.  I took my mum, so not sure about whether men were allowed in the back waiting room.   I had discovered a lump a couple of weeks before and at the one-stop appt I had a consultation & examination, followed by a mammogram with something that acts to highlight areas of concern in the breast (weird feelings when that goes in!).  After that I had a wait for an ultrasound where the radiologist took three biopsies.  Then another wait to speak to the consultant before I was allowed to go home and return two weeks later for results of biopsy (my hospital only has results clinics on specific days of the week, hence the rather longer wait than most people had). All the way through the staff were fantastic and explained what was happening at each stage.  There was a very relaxed feel to the clinic.  I was told by the consultant that the radiologist thought my lump looked suspicious, so had prepared myself for the cancer diagnosis when I returned. If you don't have anyone to take with you, definitely take a book.  I was there for about three hours in total. It will be a tough weekend wait, but I have learnt through this journey that waiting becomes part of the process. ",
