      "Content": "Hello and welcome, your news is very new and your mind will be searching for answers. I feel your heading in the right direction as when I was first diagnosed I think I thought I could run well before I walked through my new journey. It's been just over a year and my advice is fasten your seat belt girl the ride is shall we say different to anything you have rode in your life. It's not all tears and its not all pain, you be may like me feel emotions that you didn't even know you had and venture into places in your mind that you didn't know existed. The best advice I can give is talk, talk as much as you can about everything. You have a lovely family you now have macmillian help. No matter how big or small your questions are ask. Even on your darkest saddest hours you are not alone there is always someone who will want to help xx anytime xx",

      "Content": "Oh gosh I am sorry to hear this but as I sit here having had the same op 7 days ago I feel for you. I am aware of skin dieting and going black as my mum many years ago had the same problem. It was caused by over filling in her case and too much skin stretching. Besides that I'm not much help sorry lol but it's nice to see we are going through the similar times in our journey. I too am very concerned when they remove my plaster that this will happen to me. When I first had my op I had a blister that had to be dressed twice a week for 3 months, but my good news is unlike my mum my skin did get better so there is hope for us. I also knew that it was a little scary for them as they held chemo back till it got better lol you know that look they give each other when they are pretending they are not worried. We also have to remember I feel sometimes that they do their best I guess. Saying that I have changed my doctor because of his bedside manner lol as for the lady who has so much back pain have you been to physio. I have just before Christmas omg Incan not believe after so much pain how different it has made me feel. Hope we can all be new friends and help each other. I don't know much but what I do will share lol.",

What is even worse there is always someone who knows someone who had the same op and wow how well it was and how well they are doing. Well I am chuffed for them and ok a little envious lol mine didn't go like I thought it would. The other day a health care at work said her friend same op had nothing but trouble and I was thinking omg I'm normal I am not the only one haha crazy journey we are on eh ! Xx",

My news is good well bloody fantastic, All nodes neg, my tumor hasn't spread  and depending on op bi-op there will be no need for Chemo or radiotherapy now. I am still stage 1 and will get my grade after the op. I caught it early I'm so lucky and on such a high. I have joined the quest trial and the random computer has chosen me to have Reconstruction with back flap and implant. My doctor is very nice and I felt at ease and don't feel as frightened. We talked lots and I felt like I was over staying my welcome at times but he never budge or wanted me to leave till I was certain I understood everything. We also talked about gene test etc. Its all go now on the 18th. Like I say we don't all get our wishes guess it was my lucky day for a change, I'm still here for anyone else to chat, laugh or cry with and even if were all at different stages were all the same in my eyes on this crazy rolller coaster together xxx ",

I know my nana died young too of cancer but we are not really sure because it was such along time ago and my mum has died now. (not of cancer) So I have asked to be tested, mainly for my daughter. If I carry the gene or I am at high risk I will ask for my right removed before it has a chance to start anything.",

After trying everything including a new sock over gauze (don't ask) I had ran out of skin space to place anything sticky that wasn't red angry and very sore. My Dr has given me sterostrips to put on my legs to see if there as bad but they keep coming off. If I put dressing on the blisters it makes have more chance of getting infected than my op scar, so my doc says which is common since but i didn't think like that.

      "Content": "When I went to see my surgeon with the results after my operation he might have well been talking Spanish because besides watching his lips move my ears had decided to close down after hearing more cancer. It's the word cancer just knocks me off my feet I say it but hearing someone else say it is different. I was aware of my attention scan after my first sorry you have cancer shock I was also aware that doctors talk like they are taught. Big words, long words, words that start with different letters that makes us wonder who invented phonics and then started knife with a k lol. What I did was say can you write down please the main results as for some reason my brain didn't follow me to this meeting but when I am home I can diejest what you are saying and maybe understand a little better. My surgeon said can I print you out a copy of the report and anything that you don't understand can be dissuaded with your breast cancer nurse, a nurse, or on a return visit with him self. I then took my print out home and scared myself a little more with the computer at home like we do haha we only read the negative bits when that little thing called fear takes hold lol but it sort of helped mainly talking on here on chat and hearing of the users view rather than the doctors view. Maybe on your next meeting if you ask for a print out it will help you too xx Hope my short novel helped good luck xx",

I have not been on this site for very long but to be truthful got more help here in a week than the five before it that I was firstly told.

I mean a hug we give them in there millions yet all of a sudden I was very aware of been hugless and boy did I cry about it. Me cry super mum super carer super woman. You know one night in hossie my whole cancer crap hit my whole new very much in pain crap and I had a panic attack from hell, first and last I hope. My mac nurse was called who was working from home and then a woman who not trained but lovely and I have met a few times came and said some words and then just hugged me outta the blue. A hug i can still feel today. So what I'm saying is its not just a hug sometimes and I hope my cyber hug to you feels the same. I wish we could get off this crazy ride but at least where all on it together on here, look at me telling you to keep your chin up while I'm rubbish at doing it Lol. Oh yeah I stopped smoking 6 yrs ago with a book from Allen Carr. Read it its funny really and he tells you why you smoke not just how to stop. Hope todays a good day huni for you xx",

I don't know what no special type means or Her 2 neg I just wrote it down, she may have told me but I can not remember. I have to wait till Thursday for lymph node results and more bi-ops that were taken from the other side. I'm told I may jump a grade and Chemo/ radio will also be on the books and then the op will be different. Not that I have chosen one, well not totally. The whole thing is happening so fast yet my life's in slow motion. They have asked me to consider Quest which I was till I was told it may be Quest B. I am under no pressure but I know I will not do B but now feel a little guilty. My op is booked for this month tick tock the clock is getting louder. I have lots of love family and friends god bless them all but now I have become a patient and they are all forgetting I used to be a person too. Spoke to Mac nurses today and some other guys and found I'm still there, even though I cry more I still want to laugh and feel normal or as normal as I can be. The main thing I want help with is to hold my kids with out fear for them, which I hide good cos that what mums do, will that fade with time. Happy New Year to everyone x  ",

I don't want them ever to feel like i did which was be really strong and hold the fought. I have said to cry at anytime and to ask questions or just sit and hug and told them and told them how hard I found it with their Nana, who has since passed with other things.  My boy who's the youngest is taking things the worse and his little chin quivers some times making him look way younger, the sadness takes my breath and I smile and say lets hug, sometimes have a little cry together but its draining if I'm truthful, not that I will stop. Its these little things that you can not tell the others (family /friends) How do you say I dread my sons tears sometimes on one of my bad days with out sounding like a selfish mother who has chose to have a hide away from the world day.  The quest is a national trial that is taking place and hopefully help others in our shoes in years to come.  I really do not know enough to go through its as its all part of the snakes and ladders game my life has taken to play right now. One minute I think I understand the next they give me Trial B and I'm back down the snake. I really want to help and there is really no pressure but the part B is like what my mum had and I don't want to go through that.  Guess I will know more Thur when the rest of my results come. Anyway today I have gone from ringing the mac center and saying that I didn't really know to say, sounded really dumb haha to feeling a little better because I don't feel as lost in my new world.

Its a lovely way to communicate because when your having a bad day your words all come crashing and then everyone just gets mixed up when you could just say,I'm having a 3-10 day please respect at the moment and it stops all of this. I take it I'm on the right tracks for some reason I want to question every thing at this moment in my life Lol. My girls a emu who puts her head in the sand or gets angry. Shes just started to party bless her but rings home just in case, her silence speaks words sometimes. Suzie Thanks for that and I'm still taking small steps but its nice to know that someone wants to walk with me. My partner is very helpful bless him feels like I have a new jacket on lol He is a love and keeps trying to feed me up and likes to know where I am 24/7. He thinks others in my shoes may scare me and I'm trying to say at the moment no matter how many times he helps I still fell like I'm sinking. If I had two friends one with a baby and one with out and my first new born was crying I would seek help from the one who had been there first. I would also ask the one with out children but more than likely she wouldn't know as much even though she would go out of her way to help. Its taken me 5 weeks to think come on girl move ya bum your stronger than this, guess hes probably feels a little redundant lol",
