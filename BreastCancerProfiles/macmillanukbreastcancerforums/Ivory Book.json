      "Content": "Because of your general muscle distribution, it is difficult to differentiate this \"lump\" from any other by a photo alone. Only a medical evaluation which will include a physical exam, can give you the answers you need and as Marsha above says, most members of this site wouldn't be able to give an on-the-spot diagnosis anyway.",

      "Content": "I think most of the patients on this site agree that the waiting is the worst bit. I like to think that as your doctor hasn't referred you immediately, s/he is of the view that it's nothing sinister. Don't be worried by the word \"mass\" either - it is merely a medical term for \"lump\" and is more likely to be benign than malignant. Let us know how things progress.",

      "Content": "I'm sorry to hear you are feeling so rough after your surgery. Have you tried to contact your consultant or breast care nurse to ask about the elevated calcium levels and why they think this has happened to you? As I said in a previous post, hypercalcaemia doesn't necessarily mean your disease has spread elsewhere. There are other possibilities too. Also, it is highly likely your anxiety is responsible for some, if not all of the other strange symptoms you're experiencing and is nothing whatsoever to do with your breast cancer.",

She has had a persistant pain in her right side and various other symptoms since Christmas and has talked herself into a diagnosis of ovarian cancer. Unable to sleep, she was texting me at 3 o'c this morning, so I understand you anxieties entirely. Do let us know how you get on today.",
