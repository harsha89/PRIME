    "Content": "Hi Lelotron, I felt exactly the same and desperately just wanted it all cut out and gone. My mind went into overdrive and I felt I had lumps and pains everywhere. I probably won\u2019t be necessary for you either and we have to trust what we are told is best for us. I sailed through lumpectomy, node clearance, radiotherapy and now hormone therapy ( when I can find one to suit me). It\u2019s a frightening journey , but you\u2019ll do it and come through the other side... good luck and stay close to this site, the advice and support is wonderful ! Xx",
