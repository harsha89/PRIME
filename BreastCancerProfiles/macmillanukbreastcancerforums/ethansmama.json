    "Content": "Hi I was diagnosed in march, and was told the tumour was grade 3, very aggressive and attached to muscle of breast, which meant i couldnt get surgery straight away.  ive since had all my tests and scans and im glad to report the cancer had not spread and is contained in the breast.  Ive since had two treatments of chemo, on second week after the second treatment, and have to say im feeling quite good.  Still got 4 more treatments, surgery and radiotherapy to go. At the moment my biggest fear is the unknown of how the chemotherapy might effect my immune system, and get scared of what i may pick up, but i just try and take each day as it comes, and be thankful for everyday i feel good.  I also keep thinking how many worse off people out there, there are, who have diseases who prevent them from living a normal life and looking after their babies. Try and keep yourself busy, just try and live a normal life as possible and do not let this disease get you down.  Any time you are panicky and worried, get on the forum and seek some support. Rely on family and friends, who all want to help. Most times i stop and think, and feel its all very unreal.  i think the word cancer is scary to everyone, but really its only a word, you should just think of this time as a hurdle in life to get over, and just keep thinking how lucky your going to be at the end of everything, when you will be one of the few who can really truly appreciate your life",
