      "Content": "Going on my experience, I went to the breast clinic as I found a lump I had a physical examination and the area where the lump was, was marked I then was sent straight for a mammogram and then into an ultra sound.  I was told there and then it was cancer.  A biopsy was taken and they also examined the lamp nodes under the arm.  I had my husband with me, which was a great because he listened out for things he knew I wouldn't.  I was asked if I had discharge from the nipple and also wether I had any numbness in my arm.  Its good your mum is going with you.  I went to the doctors with my lump and was told not to worry as it was tissue damage, so husband and I went together on the proviso after the examination we were going out to lunch.  So you can imagine the shock I had laying on the bed to be told its Breast Cancer.  We still haven't been out to lunch and its ten months on.   Please use this site, everyone on here is wonderful everyone has been through it.  The advise, love and hugs is unbelievable.  Any questions everyone has answers because they probably have been through it.",

Had mammogram and lump detected and then ultrasound straight after, told there and then before biopsy taken it was cancer.  Will never forget the lady doing the ultra sound asked how I felt and I thought how do you think I feel, but my husband who was there said I swore at her so he jumped in to say you have to understand the doctor told her it was tissue damage.  Them told they would do a biopsy then but would have to come back a week later for results.  Day after laying to rest his aunt who died of breast cancer had it confirmed by doctor it was.  Doctor surprised that husband and I were so calm but explained what was said and that we had weekend to come to terms with it.  It is the most mind numbing thing to here that word, please keep on this site women and men are wonderful you get advice  and even reading through other peoples comments we are all in this together.  My thought are with you, fingers crossed xx",

I read a lot about lymphedema and yes it does scare me, but like you I am religious about my arm exercises, and so far so good.",

I was diagnosed last April had a biopsy done at start and told no signs in the nodes so straight for mastectomy and reconstruction.  Four nodes taken out during op and two showed slight traces so chemo then recommended as a precautionary. After chemo, recommended all nodes taken out under arm in hospital for one night and the remainder taken out.  Even after chemo a further two showed slight traces, so that was four out of the twenty ish under the arm.  Operation was five weeks after last chemo,  I have been doing exercises as shown by physio.  Had two appointments since op, 80ml of fluid drained off first time which apparently was good and a tiny amount drained second time. Have been very lucky in recovery.  I start three weeks of radiotherapy tomorrow., which works out to approximately seven weeks after op. Everyone is different in healing and recovery.  They will want you to be able to raise your arm above your head before radiotherapy.  Being told this geared me to doing exercises.  ",

I was originally told by my doctor it was tissue damage so imagine my surprise when hospital said its BC.  I have a fourteen your old daughter and was honest with her from the start, however what I did say to her laying on the bed was I'm not going anywhere I have your sixteenth, eighteenth, prom, twenty first, marriage to see and I also want to be a nanny.  I got through setting myself targets and trying to be positive about it, which believe me isn't easy.  My first target was to get up with my daughter and husband everyday, if I went back to bed after they had gone to work and school that was fine.  I had down days but my family where a reason to keep going and fighting.  My daughter is older I know but my husband and I were honest with her from the start and she has said she likes that.  Does MacMillan have books that you could purchase for telling your daughters in a way they understand? I have found this site to be great with people putting their stories on here, and believe me we have all been through or are going through our journeys and I couldn't think of a better way to get advise but from people who have been there.",
