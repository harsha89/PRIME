      "Content": "Hi everyone. Had my first of 6 (3weekly) chemo on Wednesday. Decided to go with the cold cap as I don't want sparse hair/baldness to be the first thing people notice about me.  However... I found the experience horrendous! I do suffer from tension headaches a lot so this may have made it worse. Felt like my head was in a vice and for the last hour I struggled to hold back the tears. I had been determined to approach chemo positively but feel the cold cap undermined that. Telling myself I should give it another go for cycle 2 but realistically I also feel that I don't need the extra stress. Most other people seem to have managed it and I am feeling a bit of a wimp. ",

Good job we always take her with a pinch of salt. She is very supportive when she takes her foot out of her mouth. Most annoying are those work colleagues who told me they had had BC and were up for a chat about their experience.

      "Content": "Hi Butterfly baby - welcome!  I had my 4th EC last Wednesday and have 2 more to ho before having radiotherapy. Just taking one treatment at a time so focussing on the here and now of chemo. Side effects do seem to differ vastly from person to person.  I haven't been sick, nausea felt much like that I suffered when pregnant. I have terrible heartburn though - it seems to come for a couple of days at a time, disappear and then rear its ugly head a few days later. Suffered with sleeplessness, especially when taking steroids. Seems to have been worse this time and I have been a bit demented during the day! Tiredness/fatigue has got progressively worse with each treatment but I have managed to work during week 3 of each cycle on reduced hours. Haven't had a day yet when I didn't go out of house, although I was close yesterday. Hair: did cold cap first 3 treatments but not after that as I found it a bit too traumatic. Hair just about gone now (everywhere!) But I have a wig and hats. Overall not as bad as I expected, so far, staying positive and looking forward to getting a step closer to having my life back.",

I joined this group early on after my diagnosis when I was living on google trying to find information about what was going to happen to me.  I don\u2019t post much but follow lots and at times this forum has been a godsend. I was diagnosed after finding a lump in my breast. My first mammogram three months earlier had found nothing (I\u2019m 50 too). I had a lumpectomy, chemo and finished radiotherapy just over two weeks ago. I can say it has been a real roller coaster ride so far! My advice to you at this point is take one step at a time. Focus on your operation and recovering from that first. Be kind to yourself and accept help, especially with practical/physical stuff from anyone who offers. Hugs for you for next week. Xx",

Am putting cotton wool pads under clamp and stopped at end as the sleeve pushes them into my skin. Just wondering what else I can use to cover up at night. The fine mesh leaves a pattern on my skin (even though it's not night) and I think it is going yo make my skin sore. Was thinking tubigrip but hubby says will be tii tight. What have others used?

I have shifted to tights (actually pop socks with the toe cut off). So comfortable and less obtrusive, although I find I don't care about the line being visible. Had pre chemo blood tests today -heaven; no needles! Dressing changed & cleaned - not so heavenly as the entry site is a bit red & sore. Nurse took a swab & I have to keep a close eye on it & temp. Not too worried though as I'm back for cycle 4 of chemo tomorrow so they will check it again. Hope everyone gets some sleep tonight or at least finds something good to watch on telly.",

Hubby was a mess emotionally and     I did my best to hold it together for the sake of my daughters.  Being bald was very difficult at first. As others have said I didn't see myself in the mirror and hated that people who saw me out in my various hats could work out I had cancer. I'm a very private person and I felt like I might as well be carrying a banner.  My oldest daughter said she would shave hers too and I said absolutely not! Fast forward to now and I recognise the lady in the mirror- its still me! Most of the time enjoying rocking the hats. Don't mind kids staring or asking 'where's your hair?' Do mind adults staring- want  to shout 'get a grip! Haven't you seen a bald 51 year old in a trilby before?' Hubby has progressed from hating the bald head as it reminded him what I was going through to telling me yesterday that it didn't even register with him anymore as I just looked like me. Bless! As well as the numerous ads for charity campaigns connected with cancer, it seems that every soap or drama has to have a cancer storyline. We do joke about it in our house but it shows great insensitivity by writers. Surely they can find other things to dramatise. Do, no to shaving- do something fun instead. And Macmillan, listen to those who are/have lived this nightmare. Rant over.",

However between cycles 2 & 3 my arm swelled up like a sausage and veins were virtually invisible! Blood test day before cycle 3 took 4 attempts to find vein. For chemo, took nurse two attempts and I was a mess. Senior nurse on chemo ward suggested a PICC line - talked me through procedure, gave me leaflet to read and they arranged it for me there and then. It was odd at first having such as visible reminder of what was happening to me but I got quite quickly to the point where I just don't care who sees it or what they think. Mostly I wear a mesh cover but just to keep it under control and not flap about; wear long sleeves to work but only because I'm being 'professional me' and don't want to invite any comments etc. If I ever had to go through this again (god forbid) I would ask for a PICC from the off as my sausage arm is still sore and I will def need physio afterwards. ",

I was told by breast cancer nurse to not eat raspberries or strawberries as they can harbour germs in their skins but haven't read this anywhere so not sure that this is 'official' advice. Also eating out - was definitely told by someone to not eat out at all but again haven't read this specific advice anywhere. So, just looking for clarification. Don't wan't to do anything risky but I do love raspberries (and they are sooooo healthy) and eating out was one of mine and hubbies guilty pleasures.",
