    "Content": "Me Charlie!   I\u2019m also looking for fellow ILC\u2019s and another case of reasonably freshly diagnosed ILC (just before Christmas) but awaiting further investigation.   Diagnosed in both breasts (although only biopsy made them realise in second  one) just before Christmas.  It Is a bit of a sneaky cancer.  It is scary, some days are better than others. I am just trying to keep calm and navigate a way through - it\u2019s surreal to feel well and yet be ill like this though.  I\u2019m quite young to have it too I think.  ",
