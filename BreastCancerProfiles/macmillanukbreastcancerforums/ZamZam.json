      "Content": "Hello  I feel really embarrassed to write about this but I'm hoping I'm not the only one who has experienced this. I had my second FEC T chemo last week and as of the weekend I'm experiencing really bad wind!  I can't stop farting and they really smell too! I'm too embarrassed to go out or meet anyone. Any advice would be welcome on how to reduce this side effect. ",

      "Content": "Hi Nicky  Yes I slept much better lastnight, partly I think because I was so tired from not sleeping last few days and partly because I was desperate lastnight I just drugged myself up with everything going - painkillers The low sugar ice lollies actually really helped numbing the pain I think, I will try them again today. I also put grapes in freezer lastnight and will try those.  Your comment to cry on the phone to doctors made me giggle loads lol. No I haven't seen the doctors face to face yet. The earliest I will be able to see the doctors is tomorrow because I'm not in my home city today but I go back tonight.  It's a long story - I got married 2 months ago to the man of my dreams and 3 weeks before my wedding I got diagnosed with breast cancer that had spread to my lymph nodes and required all my lymph nodes in my right arm and neck to be removed. I was in total shock and at the time felt my world come crushing down on me. Me and my partner are in our early 30's, we just never ever thought something like this could happen. All our plans changed, based on medical advice I had to leave my job, we cancelled our honeymoon as straight after wedding I had to have operation plus I had to delay my plans to relocate. My partner lives in Gloucestershire and I live in Birmingham, it was all planned I would move to him straight after the wedding but all my treatment is in Birmingham so I will be remaining there for next 6-8 months. I only see my husband on weekends as he works in Gloucester. Anyway so far I have been in Birmingham as wanted to be close to hospital and my doctor. But on Tuesday my husband came and collected me to take me to Gloucestershire for 2 days as I was so unwell and we thought it would help being with him. Anyway he is working and will drive me back home tonight, I don't have my car so can't go back.  I see my oncologist on Monday. Yes the plan is to see her before every session, next chemo session is on 30 Jan.  Lots of love  ZamZam xx ",

      "Content": "Thank you Nicky for responding and advice.  First week I suffered from real bad nausea, nearly burn, indigestion, constipation, no sleep etc, I'm so glad I'm passed that stage and feeling so much better. Now it's just the mouth pain, it's stinging burning sensation. Constant throbbing.  I'm going to buy a soft toothbrush today and try changing my toothpaste.  I do have a number to call at hospital nurses but so far they have given generalist advice on other matters, so I thought post on here to hear from people who have experienced it themselves.  I will try your tips. The mouth pain effects my sleep too, I'm hoping it goes soon. When I take 2 paracetamol, that helps for bit :-)  Xx ",

      "Content": "Hi Nicky Thank you so much for replying and advice.  I agree I turned a corner around day 8. First week was horrendous, much worse than I thought. I just couldn't sleep with nausea, indigestion and heart burn and the sleeping position made the above worse. The hospital changed my medicine and I am now over those symptoms :-) I have my energy back and I can eat now to, lots.  Overall I feel much more positive, it is only my mouth now that is the problem - teeth and gums are so painful. I rang the oncologist nurse and she said its not an infection because if that was the case it would be one tooth pain not all teeth. She said its Mocositis and to keep using mouth wash and ask doctor for gelclair.  I am taking Senna *2 for constipation and the last 2 days it has improved, so I will monitor it.  Thank you for your lovely message and kind words.  xx",

The top are absolutely fine, no pain.  I am wondering if they are affected, I don't know, but my oncologist nurse over the phone said it doesn't sound like it's infection, just Mucositis.  Sorry about my moan :-(  but I'm so glad I have this forum for sharing and advice. ",

      "Content": "Thank you for asking. The gum and teeth pain has improved a lot today :-) However my tongue really hurts as its got cuts / spots on it and I have abscess at top of my mouth, feels like the skin has peeled off at top and it hurts.  My doctor has given me gelclair, however the chemist did not have it and had to order it in, so it will arrive tomorrow afternoon. I will try the oil thing. I'm seeing my oncologist on Monday and will mention all this. xx ",

      "Content": "Hello, I am new to this Forum and would appreciate some advice.  I started FEC chemotherapy 12 days ago, and about 4/5 days now I have been experiencing mouth pain and sores, which is getting worse. I have pain around my gums, I feel my gums have darkened in colour too. I have tooth pain too, few times I actually feel my teeth are going to fall out. I have stinging burning kind of pain in both. My tongue hurts too.  I am eating normal but I feel it hurts / stings my mouth even more eating. I am regularly using the Difflam mouth wash the hospital gave me, also Nystatin for oral numbing that was given to me. Any advice please? ",

      "Content": "The pain is still really bad, I have just been to Asda to pick up ice Lolly, not sure if that will help but I will try it.  I have taken more pain killers too, both paracetamol and nurefon. I have done most of the suggestions but at the moment my mouth seems to be on fire and constant throbbing and stinging  pain. I'm just scared it's going to be another night of pain. The last 3 nights I haven't slept with teeth and gum pain, it honestly crosses my mind that my teeth are going to fall out.  The roof of my mouth has an ulcer on it, my tongue has spot and cuts on it. But the worst pain is the gums and teeth. The insides of my cheeks have got excess skin and sore marks. It's just awful. I am using a child's toothbrush now which is better than adults.  I still need to get my doctor to prescribe me gelclair. ",
