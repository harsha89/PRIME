    "Content": "My daughter was diagnosed after finding a lump, a scan detected a second lump. Today she goes for results of the genetic blood test and the mri and to find out the treatment course.  Already my daughter is pushing me away, she's started to. Make spiteful comments towards me. I'm finding this hard to cope with especially as her treatment hasn't started yet  ",
