      "Content": "Hi to everyone  I had my left breast taken off on the 2nd November . It freaked me out that I was.taken straight into.the theatre room which isn' the nice white sterile room that you see on TV.  The anethertisist had to do into my feet and both arms to find a vein all my veins are bad since I had chemo when I was 23 from hodgkins disease which I've had twice in my life 21 radiation and 23 a year of chemotherapy.  Now 50 it's breast cancer it's been removed and so we're 4 lymph nodes one has tested positive to cancer . I have just been told it's either going to be further surgery or chemotherapy  after Xmas  I will be told on tuesday the decision that will be made. I haven' started tamoxifen yet. I have also been granted my wish to have the right one off also healthy but I don' care it is also a big time bomb waiting as I've had radiotherapy whilst I was 21 because of this breast cancer is more dangerous to happen to me . Thank you for reading many regards xxxx",

      "Content": "Hiya thank you for replying . Yes they understand at hospital pink rose suite grimsby. I said I cant take things going on in my veins they just are knackered because of the chemo I had at 23.  I also had the same as you did I had to climb onto the operating table. It looked more like a loading bay than what I'd seen on TV.  For my healthy but don't care it's going right breast when it will be operated on the team have said they won' put me through that again.  I' m on my 2nd week of recovery I'm at the hospital twice a week for dressing changes. I think from what I've read on other ladies and gents stories with the same thing one node cancerous that it will be chemotherapy again. The staff have said I will have a canula so I don't have to go through that again. I don't care about my hair as I've lost it 3 times before. I've seen a beanie hat I like I won't wear a wig they are horrid.  After chemo or another operation I will be going on tamoxifen I know that . The surgeon said of a breast density.of 51 milimtres the tumour was 46 milimtres wow omg.  I'm not scared and to be honest I don't miss the left breast to lose them is keeping me alive.  Positive thinking even when things arnt going to plan xxx",

      "Content": "Hi everybody I was on here before worried about my results. I have now been given my results I have stage 2 breast cancer it is in my left breast I have two lumps and nodules around the lumps.  They were fantastic at the breast clinic at the princess of Wales hospital in grimsby. I am now waiting to have a bone scan and a cat scan. I have asked for both of my breasts to be removed as previously I had hodgkins disease at 21 whist being pregnant with my son I got it again 17 months later and had to have chemotherapy for almost a year. I'm now 50 and cancer is back. They said I was high risk because of the radiation treatment . I don't want to think about my right breast may get cancer so I've decided if I can a double masectomy.  Now I know I am prepared and ready to battle with cancer again. Think positive ladies and be strong xx",

I wanted to wait a week to get my diagnosis but in my mind I'd seen the pictures of the scan and I knew it was . In that week I told everyone who needed to know preparing them before I got the results. I don't think I'm strong I just want all of us to know we can fight it and win xx",

My breast hurts and is black through the biopsies . I have had arm and shoulder pain for months now I did a blood test I was.borderline multiskeletal and my Dr has logged I need a pain injection. However now I think the breast and shoulder and arm pain is linked. I've had cancer twice in my twenties at the time I was pregnant at 21. I've had radiotherapy and a year of chemo. I thought if anything it would be hodgkins again it's a shock the news I know I'm going to get xx",

I've battled with cancer when I was 21 non hodgkins lymphoma and had radiotherapy but it came back when I was 23. (It started when I was pregnant at 20) I had a bone marrow test done I'd got it again it was in my liver and spleen I had a yr of chemo and had a 3yr old to deal with it was very hard. At 37 I started having yearly mammograms because of mantle radiotherapy all those yrs ago. I've hit 50 it's finally got me again but my attitude is take.them both off. I've had surgery done on 2nd Nov I feel bloody sore but I'm OK long journey ahead but once this one is healed and sorted the right one will be done . Cancer has been a massive part of my life but I've learnt one thing it's not going to win and be positive the more you are the less you are afraid xxx",
