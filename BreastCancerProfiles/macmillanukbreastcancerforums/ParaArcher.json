    "Content": "Do you know what, after reading through all your comments about how you have been treated, it appals me to think that our families can behave like that.  From another slant though, and I really do think it is indicative that we as mothers shield every bad thing we can from others, especially our offspring and it's done to protect them, to save them from the suffereing that you suffer and it then becomes almost instinctive of them to show that it doesn't bother them.  It's not them being selfish, it's what we have actually done to make them feel like this and there is no right or wrong in that.  Mothers are in the main, very selfless people because we put everyone before ourselves.  So, when a cancer diagnosis comes along, the hardest thing is to say to those you've shielded for eternity, that you now need to be the shielded.  You have got to sit your families down and let them know that you need the love, the appreciation, the cuddles, the hope, the chocolate, the flowers, the smiley faces on bits of paper.   You need to tell your work collegueas how you really feel but do a round robin email to everyone and give them an inkling.   If you're telling them you are okay, then they will believe that and won't think to offer compassion when they feel it is not needed. The first thing people will tend to say when you break your mould  is \"Why did you not tell us, we didn't know you were feeling like this\".  We are ALL wired differently, because people don't view or process our thoughts in exactly the same way but we think that they should!! Ladies, if you're having a hard time at home, please, say something.  The thought of what they might say tends to be far harsher than what they will actually say and believe me, it should help things and most importantly, help you!! As for the £1.80 requested back whilst living rent free to pay off her debts, (I know, it's easier for me to say) but I would have no hesitations of telling her that unless her attitude changes, and her complete and utter disregard for her parents generous help, her bags will be packed!!  I think my hand print would be on her face too! On that note, I'm 44 and learnt very early that you get no thanks for speaking the truth but you FIND the best people when you do and it rids you of those who are not worth your breath.  It's exhillerating!!!  You need to fight the biggest health issue that nobody wants to know or have, why do it with people who can't be bothered to have a decent conversation with you about it.  Talking is healing.   Love to you all.  Xxx",
