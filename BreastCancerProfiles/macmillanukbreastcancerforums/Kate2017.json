      "Content": "Hi everyone, in the last 2 months I've developed soreness in both breasts. I went to see a specialist who refered me for an ultrasound which revealed lumps in both breasts. Whilst one he said was more consistent with being benign, he didn't say that about the other. On the ultrasound it is more circular and darker.  I can't feel either lumps myself after several (hundred) self checks. He was able to feel the one that seems more suspicious.  Other than breast soreness I have no other symptoms. Lymph nodes are normal and the 'growth' is about 1.4cm.  I'm booked in for a biopsy on Monday which doesn't sound very pleasant, but more so, I'm terrified by the possibility of a cancer diagnosis. There's no family history of breast cancer.  Any words of wisdom gratefully received. Is there a good chance this could be a cyst? Anyone else had similar experiences? Thanks x",
