    "Content": "I too am constantly uncomfortable after my LD reconstruction.  It is now 2 years on and I still have a soreness around the scar line which every bra irritates after a few hours and I now only wear very soft, stretchy bras designed to sleep in.  I also horse ride and am very physical and I find that every night my back is sore and my implant twitches.  I did tell my Surgeon of my lifestyle and now know that this really isn't the op for someone like me.  Too late now but if I could go back I would have gone for the DIEP.  I also had to have the implant taken out and replaced as it tightened and scarred.  I sympathise with anybody having to make the choice but although the LD flap should take less time to recover from , in reality it would have been better to go with the DIEP.  Good luck",
