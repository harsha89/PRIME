    "Content": "Hi Annie, I just finished 6 rounds of FEC100. It was definitely not a walk in the park but probably not as bad as I expected. I wasn't sick once and kept my hair using the scalp cooler (but only on my head!!). I found day 4-5 were usually the worst. I got as much sleep as I could in the first few days - boring but it helped. I was unusual as I found drinking milk helped and eating rice crispies. My nausea was more indigestion type pain and Lansoprasol helped along with Senna (to counter the effects of the ant-sickness. Use your Metaclopramide whenever you need it. I bought loads of ginger things because I had been recommended them and could not stand them. I also was badly affected by the smell of shampoo, conditioner and cleaning products.Eventually just the tought of walking into the chemo unit used to make me feel sick. Even now I have finished I find that hard and some smells still make nme retch. I was reall peed off to still have periods - they told me they would stop and they never did. Not fair really!   Now starting on 5 weeks of radio with a 72 mile round trip every day - total 1950 miles (cost £350!) Also Tamoxifena and Herceptin. Good luck with the chemo. Hang in there - the end will come. Tick off the days on a calendar and draw smileys on the days when you feel better and can have some fun. Julie T",
