      "Content": "Hi Diane, Well I had immediate implant recon followed by radiotherapy - 5 weeks and am now facing alternative recon as the radiotherapy has contracted the capsule that forms around the implant and pushed it up hence it's mishapen and feels uncomfortable, though not painful. Appartently these capsules usually form around the implant anyway as it't the bodies way of isolating a 'foreign body'. However, radiotherapy nearly always distorts this further, the result being the breast is more like a hard bump than anything else. Corrective recon is further jeapordised by the fact that the skin is already weakend by the radiotherapy. I don't know if that helps or not. I don't mean to be too negative but with hindsight I think I would've waited until after treatment before having recon. Perhaps you could tell me how you found the back flap procedure as that is an option I'm considering now. All the best Sue",

      "Content": "Hi girls, Just been reading the threads on Breast Reconstruction and was very encouraged on the whole. This is to do with recon but the other is a bit long now so thought I'd start a new one. I had a mastectomy and recon at the same time. As I am only small breasted, I opted for an implant which is placed behind the chest wall. However, I'm not actually that happy with it now. Because I had it done straight away, I was subjected to radiotherpy afterwards which I got through okay. The new 'breast' is just like a small bump and sits higher than my other one. At the mo there is no nipple on it either, but even if I were to have a nipple put on, stick-on or tattooed, it would still sit higher than the other and would be below the scar as well which I'm not convinced would look right. If that's vain, then so be it, but I am on my own and hope one day to form a new relationship. Has anybody else had this kind of recon, and if so, how do they find it? Mine is quite hard, and at times it is uncomfortable when I'm doing jobs, as obviously the muscle is over the top of the implant (presumably to keep it in place) and so it pulls at times. Doesn't hurt but just uncomfortable. I think too I may have (i forget the name of it) but some kind of capsule which has grown around it. Anybody got any comments or advice on this? Thanks Sue x",

      "Content": "Hi Girls, Yes, I'm on Zoladex too. Like Pat, I'm supposed to be on it for 2 years as I'm borderline menopausal and had a hormone-induced cancer which resulted in a mastectomy. I'm also on Tamoxifen for 5 years. I'm interested to hear that there is apparently a test avaialble for oesteoporiasis (spelling again). I have another check up next week so will ask them about it. I finish my Zoladex at the end of the year when hopefully, the ONE BIG HOT FLUSH will lessen somewhat. Do you still get flushes with Tamoxifen or not? Also, does it cause weight gain or is this a myth?",

      "Content": "Hi there, I'm being encouraged to have a LD back flap with implant. Intially I hav implant only but subsequent radiotherapy has caused distortion. My worry is not abou the op itself but the recovery time as I live alone and work full-time. Does it really take 6-8 weeks before you can drive? Has anyone driven after say four weeks? It's really difficult in terms of taking time off work. How have other folk got around this probem, or do they all have partners who can support them? I also wondered whether a free flap would be an option as the recovery period may be less if no muscle is cut. Anyone had one of these? Please help with any comments at all as I've been in this dilemma for ages now, and need something done. Many thanks Sue",
