      "Content": "Hi telgirl, welcome to the site. Sorry you had to join us, but I think you will be glad you did. Everyone on here is very supportive and there is always someone who can help with sound advice. It is only natural that you are feeling awful but try not to get too stressed imagining all sorts of horrible things. I know that is easier said than done. Diagnosis and treatment are much better these days and if it is cancer the surgeons etc will move things along as quickly as possible. 1cm is relatively small so surgery should be ok to remove it. It was 2 months after i found my lump that i eventually got to the consultant so things are moving quickly for you. Hope things go well on Monday.    Take care. Love and hugs. Debbie. xx",

      "Content": "Hi Debbie, I also had a mastectomy on the 2nd of september. Had a sentinel node biopsy at the same time. Results came back clear, but as only 2 nodes taken I am not convinced that not in lymph nodes. I had some vascular invasion (blood) so am anxiously awaiting referral letter from the oncologist so that chemo can get underway. I fully expected to have my lymph nodes removed as underarm very sore before and after surgery. I have to trust in their superior knowledge and hope I am just being a little paranoid! I think I would have felt less anxious if my lymph nodes were removed during the op, but you have to be sure this is what you want and know why. The breast care nurses are generally very good at answering any worries you have. Good luck for your op on the 8th, hope it all goes well. Take care. Love and hugs. Debbie. xx",

      "Content": "Hi, have recently been diagnosed with cancer in my right breast. It is probably 28mm in diameter (consultants words) which seems quite big to me, with ill defined edges. The lab report came back as malignant, high grade, invasive. My confusion comes from the fact that it has been described as high grade but don't know what grade and have noticed some of the discussions on forum mention what grade the cancer is prior to surgery! I was told that the grade wouldn't be known until the lump is out. Also been told will need chemo and radiotherapy after surgery. A little confused. Thanks. Debbie. xx",

Haven't been told if oestrogen or progesterone positive or Her pos yet either. Have appointment next Thursday, which was originally supposed to be today. Hope I'll have a lot more answers by then, but the wait is going to drive me mad. Thanks for your reply. Debbie. xx",
