      "Content": "I am really struggling today and would appreciate some advice. long story short. I have a history of bc in family (grandmother and 6 aunts have all passed away. I get yearly check ups last year I had a mammogram that showed something so I had a scan. radiologist told me it was a small cyst. was never offered any further tests. anyway. discovered a lump on breast saw consultant last week got mammogram done same day. was invited back on wednesday for scan and 2 core biopsy. to be told that unfortunately the thing they though was a cyst was never a cyst and radiologist apologised - was in totally mess so don't recall much conversation after that other than they will be in contact within 7 days with a result. I asked three times did they think it was cancer and got told he couldn't speculate till results are back. so. ow I am left in limbo and this thing has been growing in me for over a year. I have been having pain in my left shoulder could this be all linked. only thing they told me was it was 2cm. now. just can't stop crying,",
