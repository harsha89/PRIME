    "Content": "Hi Hope someone can help... Here's my story. BC diagnosed 11/12/08. WLE & ALND on 9/1/09. At home - post surgery recovery. Seeing onc next week to plan chemo followed by radio. (age 42 - 3 kids - 12, 9 & 7) Am trying to plan ahead. Q1. How soon after surgery does chemo usually start. (Daughter is anxious about birthday party!) I would like to do a few things like theatre trips etc. with my gang before I start the next leg of my journey. (And then how long 'till radio...) Q2. I work pt in a school. Can anyone advise me with issues of how long before sick pay stops etc. etc. I'm expecting a visit from Head Teacher soon and would like to know where I stand! Any other advice / comments gratefully received. Thanks",
