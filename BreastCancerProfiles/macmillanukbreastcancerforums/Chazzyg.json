    "Content": "Hi, Good luck tomorrow . I have finished 4 FEC & just had my 5th taxol today. Drinking lots really helps both during & after . Dont worry about red urine that goes with drinking liquid quickly . You may find that the steroids keep you awake on first night after FEC . Time will fly after you start & whilst everyone finds some things hard . It's all very doable  and you everyone really helps with their experiences . I've learned some much by reading the advice people have shared & this help with the physical effects & emotional ride. Like Shaz - I never rides at the fair either but I've learned about myself & great people around on this one so far . I appreciate so many things more - like a bright sunny day - days when I can really taste food & enjoy it & the stupid things that now make me laugh and smile . I may look like Uncle Hester from the Adams family at the moment but I love teasing people & a sense of humour helps you & everyone around you when if it's wicked sometimes .   Will be thinking of you & Shaz  Chazzy  xx    ",
