    "Content": "I was diagnosed with DCIS in December 2014 and lumpectomy in January 2015 followed by radiotherapy.  Wound did not heal up so had local anesthetic in September 2015 to clear any inflammation and problem around wound. Wound healed up almost immediately. Cared for my husband for 15 months who was diagnosed with duodenal cancer a month before my diagnosis. He unfortunately passed away in March 2016.  Now I've got to go in for hysteroscopy procedure on a polyp now found in my womb (also have several fibroids which they won't do anything about) assuming it to be a result of taking Tamoxifen tablets.  Hopefully it will be benign as most polyps are.  Second mammogram will be in January.",
