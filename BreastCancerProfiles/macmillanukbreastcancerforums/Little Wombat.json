      "Content": "Not posted here for a while, but have been keeping my eye on you all. You may recall my concerns over taking Letrozole prescribed following lumpectomy for 17mm invasive lobular carcinoma in July and 5 weeks radiotherapy.  Cancer was oestrogen receptive and I was prescribed Letrozole as 'belt and braces' and was told it would give an extra 2% prevention. Had a meeting with my Consultant who was very dismissive of my concerns and basically chastised me for questioning his recommendations.  We agreed I would give it a go for 3 months.  It was suggested by a lovely lady on the forum, that I take half a tablet, which I did for a couple of months and then full tablet for 3rd month.  Suffered dreadfully with flushes, sleep deprivation, weight gain, thirst and hair brushing out in clumps.  When I met him again, he suggested that I stop taking it for a month and then prescribed Tamoxifen for 3 months to be reviewed in May.  Within 36 hours of stopping Letrozole, I was back to my old self and felt/feel wonderful. I have read the possible side effects for Tamoxifen and cannot believe that having suffered so badly with Letrozole, that I would not experience some of them.  One of the side effects is the possibility of endometrial or uterine cancer. Here's my dilemma. Firstly, is this worth it for just 2% prevention. Then, if I DON'T take it, what are the chances of breast cancer returning, but if I DO take it, what are the chances of developing another (undetected) cancer. IF I try it for 3 months and find I cannot tolerate it, will I have done irreversible damage. I am 50/50 down the middle and really need to know what you all think - particularly for such a low percentage of prevention. BTW I am 66 and until this diagnosis have never been ill or taken any medication - not even an antibiotic. Fit and well, work full time.  Sailed through 4 pregnancies from the age of 37 to 42, and had a very easy menopause, not losing any sleep or experiencing debilitating hot flushes. I am assuming that I will get annual mammograms which I assume will detect any further problems - although I have not received any notification of this and my 12 month check up following my operation has been put back twice and is now scheduled for 15 months after my operation. Hope someone can help me here.  Is this worth it for 2%?? Please feel free to send me a private message if necessary.  Thank you for listening.",

      "Content": "Hello Claire.  Can so relate to your comments.  Like you, I need to know everything and be prepared and organised. I had my MRI last week - fortunately I had googled what to expect as no one explained anything to me when there.  I had a canular fitted in my arm as apparently blue dye is pumped around in order to highlight the lymph nodes (I think!) and was then taken in to a room with a machine that looked like a model of the channel tunnel.  Lay down on my tummy with my face in a recess, on what felt like a plank, whilst the radiographer (she was sooooo tall - over 6ft - and quite well built and because she had such short hair, it made her appear even taller - not sure why any of that is relevant, but it was so weird!) fiddled to adjust the bed/plank to my size, tucked, my boobs and arms in, popped in some earplugs and put a huge pair of earphones on my head.  (I was told there would be music, but there was none - she apparently forgot to switch it on).  I was then reversed into the tunnel.  Because I was face down and went in feet first, I could see nothing.  But no one told me how noisy it would be!  As I said, fortunately I had googled the procedure and sort of new what to expect.  In a way it was strangely comforting as it sounded just like an old diesel engine and I did nearly fall asleep.  When I was let out, the tall radiographer took me to a side room, took out the canular, directed me to another room to change and that was it!  Caught the bus home.  Is this normal procedure? I do seem to have drawn the short straw when it comes to communication - or is it because I too am a bit of a control freak and need to know what's going one! It was interesting to read your comment about talking to your doctor, because I have had no communication at all from mine.  Should I have had? My nurse has told me that following my comments, I shall be seeing a different specialist tomorrow.  I am not sure if that is a good or a bad thing. Chin up for MRI - I have no idea how to link it to other posts but would be interested to know what pre-advice you were given. Was advised to lock in to a box set to help with the stress, but cannot concentrate on anything.  Mind you, the only box set currently in the house belongs to one of my sons - and I don't think Breaking Bad is really my scene! Forgive me if I am rambling. S. What DOES the tag mean?",

Well, went along for my pre op assessment (op scheduled for next Friday) and the results of my MRI, had a 2 hour wait inbetween appointments and my consultant running late so another 2 hours in waiting room. To be told that the MRI has shown 2 'small lesions' next to original tumour and that I need a biopsy on these 2 lesions to see what they are.  If this fails to show anything significant, I will have to go to London to be scanned on a specific machine(?) Biopsy scheduled for tomorrow morning. Surgery and all other appointments cancelled until results through next week! The word of the day is \"shite\"!!",

I had an MRI last week to ascertain how bad it is and have an appointment on Thursday for the results and to be advised on next course of action. My brain is in overdrive - the waiting is just almost unbearable - and I would like to know what questions I should be asking at this appointment.  I am not very enamoured with my specialist - he was very rude and abrupt - we all have bad days, but hey!  Having initially been told that as it was so small that lumpectomy and radiotherapy would be the most likely outcome, he only spoke about mastectomy and chemotherapy - without knowing the results?  Or may be he knew more than he was letting on.  What should I be asking? Has anyone questioned their treatment programme?",

      "Content": "Hello Julia Thank you for your reply.  How calming your words are.  I know I cannot make any decisions until I know the outcome of the MRI, but like everyone else, I am shit scared of the results. I work in a school and my surgery has coincided with the summer break. Naively I was thinking along the lines of 'great, all will be done and dusted when I return in September'!  I did not think that whatever treatment is prescribed would be stretched over such a lengthy period of time. I have not said anything at work. They know something is up as I keep disappearing for various 'appointments' but give no details.  They are a nosy, gossipy bunch and have very little to do with me, but suddenly, I am popular!!! I am an extremely capable person, and on the outside never give anything away as to how I might be feeling inside.  I am a mother to 4 and I am the strong, reliable  one in the family.  I am the one who takes charge, who is in control, nothing phases me and it can be worked out!!  I am now worried that I am going to return to work with no hair, looking drained and unable to cope. I am worried what people will say.  I will be so irritated by the sudden influx of so called 'friendship'.  No idea how to handle any of that. I am also worried that work is very busy and has taken my mind off the inevitable, however, how am I going to cope in the holidays?  My husband works nights and I work days (could say we have the perfect marriage!!) and the children are independent and no longer rely on me. Just venting my anxieties - usually these rattle around in my head and by the time I have found a pen or a computer to log it, I am unable to put it in to words. Thank you for listening. S.",

I keep asking myself how on earth I have raised someone so selfish - although this is the first instance of such behaviour.  And the bottom line is that the hospital made a huge cock up (sorry but that is what it was) with my diagnosis and subsequent time line for treatment, that I told the family (she has 3 brothers) as soon as I knew. All I want is a cuddle, someone preparing the dinner for when I get home from work. Maybe clean the bathroom or hoover, buy me my favourite choccie as a surprise/treat. Just a little bit of TLC. Is that too big an ask for what we have all been - and are going - through? Big *sigh*.  Will try and break out the sobs to try and clear my scrabbled brain. Thank you. x",

I have just received a reply which says \"The appointment should only last about 15 minutes\". I may be being a tad over sensitive here and I know they all have a job to do and I am just one of many in my position but ... only last about 15 minutes?  This appointment could be life changing. Other than being told the size I have no idea what grade, level, positive/negative stage my tumour is at (should I know this by now?) and have had no contact from anyone since my operation. I have requested copies of my biopsies taken so far to see if I can make some sense from all the technical stuff being thrown at me but not received anything so far. If there are any Breast Cancer Nurses out there reading this, could you please be a little bit more sensitive in your replies and rather than just replying to questions, maybe establish what your patient does/doesn't or indeed should know.

(Just!!! pathetic turn of phrase but could be much worse!) I have not told anyone bar my husband and quite honestly was not going to tell anyone else.  However,  I have 4 children (3 sons and 1 daughter) in their 20's.  All away from home, however, after 6 months overseas, No. 4 child returns home on the day of my op!  Typical!  Of all the days in all the year .....  I suppose therefore I need to let them know what is happening. The problem is, I don't know how! My daughter is my major concern.  She has a very busy life and I really do not want to put the dampers on her upcoming social calendar - which includes a couple of weddings (she is a bridesmaid), a house move and a christening!! I was not going to say anything until after the op but with youngest son being at home - eek!! - mind you, he is a musician and I doubt very much he will be aware of anything happening around him that is not musically realted.  Love him to pieces though. I will not get a chance to visit her to tell her face to face and will have to do it either by phone or email. Am I being flippant by just saying it is just a blip, a routine op, no major problem, will be in and out in a day? Can I get away with not saying anything at all?  Other than No.4 coming home, No. 3 is working in Scotland for the next 6 weeks, No. 1 only pops in with his drying (notice ladies I said DRYING!!  He has a washing machine in his flat but no drier and nowhere to dry his bedding.  I have trained them well!) and quite honestly I will not be seeing my daughter until mid August. Any advice would be much appreciated. Thank you all. I do glean so much comfort from all your posts.",

This should be tomorrow - although I have only had a phone call to see the BC nurse, not the specialist. I am in such a dilemma. I think I am more concerned with the timing of it.  I know there is never a good time, but it is such an important week and weekend for my daughter.  No matter how blase I try and sound I know she will be on the next train home and THAT is what I am trying to avoid!",

      "Content": "OMG I can soooooooo relate to this - with the professionals, family, work colleagues and so called 'friends'. I had a similar rant last year (diagnosed July 2016) after finishing radiotherapy in October.  I thought I was visiting a Specialist for the results of a biopsy, to be told I was due for surgery the following week. No apologiy for lack of information, no back track to find out why I had not been informed.  The BCN was somewhat sympathetic but, like you, was in a rush and just wanted me to dash through before her next appointment. Husband and family?   I am still struggling to cope with their total lack of support and cannot forgive my daughter for completely ruining a short break we had booked before diagnosis to visit the Edinburgh Festival.  She is 28.  She was petulant, stroppy, miserable.  She stomped about, stormed ahead of me, rushed meals in order to get back to the hotel and sleep.  Completely cut me out and ignored me. Ruined every show we saw.  2 months later she apologised and said she was hurt that I had not discussed anything with her.  The fact I told her when I knew did not seem to sink in, or the fact I had actually been diagnosed with cancer? I work in a School and all operations and treatment were fitted in around the Summer holidays and half term.  I did not miss a day. The office staff knew and said absolutely nothing. No hug, no cup of coffee, no concern.  It was as if nothing had happened. I have taken the decision not to take prescribed medication. In my case it will give an extra 2% prevention and I feel it is not worth it for the possible side effects.  Oncologist gave me a lecture on how hard he had fought to get funding for 'his ladies' to have Tamoxifen and I felt belittled by him. GP?  Nothing.  No contact.  No appointment for a check up. In fact I have never heard of or met the Doctor listed as my GP.  I had to ask if they were maile or female as no christian name was mentioned. He is male and apparantly has been my GP for the past 12 years!!  Just goes to show how often I have needed to see a GP. Everything continues as normal.  Cancer is not mentioned. The subject is sidelined if I mention it. No one asked how annual check up in May went. Nothing has changed.  I suppress the resentment and anger and I know that some day it will come bubbling to the surface. Until then?  Cancer?  What Cancer? My annual rant is now over.   I had been vrey upset by all the wonderful support being received by some of you and I am now comforted by the fact that I am not alone. I feel great and have been told I look great for my age.  Long may it continue. Onwards and upwards Lesleyhelen.  You are not alone. xx",

      "Content": "Well.  Thereby hangs another tale!! As I was diagnosed in May 2016, I assumed my annual review would be in May 2017?  I already had an appointment booked for 'Review of Medication' but received a number of letters advising my annual review would be in July, this was then moved to August and then again to October - at which stage I threw my toys out of the pram and asked that the 'Review of Medication' appointment be changed to my annual review.   BCN kept saying that my 'annual' review was scheduled for October.  I did fail my Maths O'level but even I could work out that May 2016 to October 2017 did not equate to 12 months!! Eventually I turned up in May for the medication review appointment (pointless as I was not taking any!!) and pointed out that as my annual review was due I would wait to be fitted in for check up and mammogram and basically refused to leave until I had had a check over.  Sat quietly in the waiting room for a couple of hours and was eventually seen and had mammogram. Then had to wait 6 weeks for results - which were all OK. For all my appointments I have put my phone on record.and had left it in my bag whilst being examined.  It was very interesting to listen to the conversation between Oncologist and BCN discussing why my 'annual  review ' had been deferred. Any finally???  Received a letter last week asking why I had not turned up for my 'annual review' beginning of October and advising this had been rescheduled for January 2018!!! The saga continues.",

You hit the nail on the head with your comment about it not being easy and the odd 'wrorry worms' (love that phrase).  They do pop up when least expecting them. don't they.  I was fortunate in that my lumpectomy was at the beginnning of the Summer hols last July and subsequent treatment was fitted in around the school day. So never actually missed a day's work. I am not sure I could have sat at home twiddling my thumbs. My role is very busy and it was almost a relief to concentrate on something else. Jojo's comments are so encouraging.  Thank you for posting them. Returning cwtches. Sandi",
