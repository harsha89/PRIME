    "Content": "I am in France.  I had my first taxotere on Thursday after 3 fec.  Here the nurses tell you to use a nail treatment containing silicium (sorry, not quite sure of the translation but I think it is a type of silicon) and an anti fungicide.  The brand they recommended was EVONAIL but I use another brand ECRINAL (both are available in the UK.  On top of two coats of that I was told to apply two coats of darks polish also containing silicium.  After a recent trip to the UK (and much bugging of the girls in department stores) I worked out that Boots No7 Stay Perfect and certain, but not all, Bourjois are good.  When I had the treatment I had both my hands and feet in frozen gloves/slippers.  I wish I had had something frozen in my mouth too. As for the aches, I wasn't given anything.  I will ask for next time, paracetamol is not up to the job.  I also have 5 jabs of white cell stimulant so it is hard to know whether it is the taxotere or the jabs which are causing the problem. Still, only two more to go.....   Tx",
