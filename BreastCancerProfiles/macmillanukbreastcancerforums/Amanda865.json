      "Content": "Kath, I can really understand how worried and anxious you are, I too was facing chemo, but my surgeon sent off tonthe states for an ONcotype DX test, my result came back as a score was 11 which meant that chemo would not be of benefit to me. I am one of three sisters, my twin and I were diagnosed within two weeks of each other, she didn\u2019t need an axillary clearance or chemo as her Oncotype DX score also came back as 11. My other sister was diagnosed 3 months later and had to have Chemo, but instead of having a high dise every three weeks she had 12 cycles, one a week which was a lower dose, she had minimal side effects, they will give you anti sickness tablets to help you, she also kept her hair on her head (she wore the cold cap); although she lost her eyebrows and eyelashes, but these returned almost immediately. Much love Amanda xxx",

Yes it\u2019s definitely nerve damage which I was warned of before the op... my arm will never feel the same again, but a small price to pay in the circumstances. I don\u2019t believe it's cording just the actual scar which is a quite raised, but i do agree with the scar tissue, its been a year on the 14th August. I am assuming that my first mammogram and appt is due soon, but haven\u2019t heard from the hospital yet, when it comes through and I have a formal appointment I will probably get peace of mind, thank you x",

      "Content": "Hi Kath, my op went well, i stayed in overnight and was due to stay another night as I was exhausted due to only being able to get one hour of sleep. I had my drains in for 10 days, a community nurse visited My home to help with my drains and take measurements of how much was draining off, you will definitely need help in the first 2-4 weeks with dressing and various activities. Begin your exercises the next morning after your operation to get movement. Do as much or as little as you can, it took me a good 4 weeks to get reasonable movement, with some of the ecercises you can feel the drain pulling inside which hurt me a little, but just take care and know your limits. I found the neck movements valuable in reducing and minimsing stiffness. I also had difficulty sleeping for several months as my arm was how I described really painful and uncomfortable, i knew that there was something wrong with my arm within approx 2 weeks as my upper arm felt swollen, heated, tingly and uncomfortable, my BC nurse measured my arm and noted a difference in size and then referred me to the Lymphoedema clinic, I had an appointment within 2-3 weeks and I am now under their care. I wear a compression sleeve daily to manage the swelling and uncomfortable feeling, as a result the size of my arm has reduced, although I will have to keep wearing the sleeve. Hope this helps xxx",

He agreed there was a definite lump, he arranged for an immediate ultrasound- the outcome is that is a bit of tissue - i think she called it necrosis? Relieved! I think this is reality now! i really appreciate your fabulous support.",

It was good that my BC nurse and consultant acted so quickly and understood my concern which my consultant could also feel. I am very very worried about recurrence as it's all I'm reading/hearing of at the moment - I am also feeling very very down at the moment, I don't feel I have any purpose at the moment, I am crying all the time and very miserable.   I have a hospital Appt this morning with a Lymphoema specialist as I have arm swelling-which is also getting me down.

One of the brands that I have researched is Wockhardt, which looks like my best option at this time. Thank you very much Amanda x Letter from TEVA...

My cancer was stage 2b as it had spread to my lymph nodes and I had to have an axillary dissection. My surgeon sent my tissue off to the US for Oncotype DX trsting-it came back as 11 which meant that I would not benefit from chemo in terms of protection against recurrence. Its good they are doing this for you. I am now scheduled to see my radiation oncologist on 2nd Oct. i hope this will be the same for you too xxxx",
