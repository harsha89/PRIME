    "Content": "Hi Kaz I am in very similar situation, i have had breast cancer and chemo twice and never never want to go through it again. For this reason i am having elective mastectomy with immediate reconstruction ( had rt mast with recon from tummy in 2008) this time i am having recon from back plus inplant.(due to have in May 2011) Â i am bracca 1 and 2 negative, but do have close family incidence. i know you will think it through thoroughly, For me a deciding factor was that i was and am sick of thinking about cancer every day - i make my lymph sore from constantly checking! and also the risk that funding may not always be available. Good luck, and stay healthy xx",
