      "Content": "Hi everyone I had breast cancer 6 years ago, mastectomy, chemo, radio etc. I went for a check up last week and the consultant found what he said was a few little lumps and it felt thicker in my ampit. Not painful until he pressed really hard. Never noticed them before but then i dont check my armpit for some reason. Its the other side of my orignal breast cancer too. Just feels lumpy . I get a sort of weird sensation down my inside arm for about a year or so now and thats why i went to doctors in first place and she sent me to oncoogist  I have an U/S and mammogram on 17 Feb but Im just wonderin gif anyone else has had this and it was nothing to worry about or should I be worried that the bitch is back?",
