I wore sports bra with softie which I was given for comfort bc told me not to buy expensive bra til everything had settled. Tips are drink plenty of fluids , I sucked pineapple peices while having chemo helps prevent sore mouth , rest when you feel the need and look after yourself try and eat small amounts take drugs you are given , get a good thermometer , do post op exercises they do help .dont know if you are having reconstruction I didn't so when I got prothesis I also got some knitted knockers for times when I wanted some softness .
