    "Content": "I have my appointment on the 10 of this month, to talk with my Oncology about another treatment because they can't give me chemo anymore. The reason of it, because my mastectomy operation will be 6 months already for this month. Is there a possibility they will give me a radiotherapy? Please any idea about it? I will be happy to hear anyone can share me about my concern. Thanks.",
