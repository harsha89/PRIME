      "Content": "Hi cookie i wouldn't say you are moaning at all and i really feel for you, i have just had my surgery a mastectomy and lymph nodes removed and am now waiting for my appointment to see the oncologist to talk about chemo and to find out when my treatment will start, my surgeon has averaged to start chemo about the end of may beginning of june and i must admit i am getting more and more nervous about it as i am dreading losing my hair, i have had some advice to cut my hair short before chemo starts so it's not too much of a shock but i just want to hang on to my hair for as long as poss, sounds daft but we all have our own way of dealing and coping with things, still can't come to terms with the loss of my breast so how the hell can i even try n think about losing all my body hair as well. Hope you have some good days hugs ruthie xxx",

      "Content": "Hi there Cookie65, just wanna say don't apologise for moaning hun, i had my 1st chemo on the 10 june 2011 having TAC n my hair started falling out 22nd june (12 days after) my partner shaved my head for me on the 15the day and i cried n cried near on all day, but have to say it's hard but tryin to get used to it. The thing i'm findin hard to cope with is the nausea feelin and being sick, it's worse than mornin sickness. Just try n keep your chin up and moan if you want to cry if you have to scream if you really must, let all your emotions out. Hugs to you Lilruthie xxx",
