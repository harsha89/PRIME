      "Content": "Hi.. I was diagnosed Tuesday and having chemo prior to surgery. Not got any dates yet and it all seems really slow moving. Putting faith in medical team and trying to stay positive by keeping busy. Not cried yet but had a few fed up moments. It's all really scary but my consultant encouraged exercise. X",

      "Content": "Hi, just had last taxotere of FEC-t and last time was manually measured it had shrunk to 3 or 4cm or thereabouts. Official ultrasound to measure it properly is on Monday followed by consultant appointment on Thursday to discuss if I am having a lumpectomy or mastectomy. My gut feeling is the latter as it doesn't seem to have shrunk as much as I hoped it would. Also had microscopic cells in my 5 lumps nodes removed in slnb so starting to worry my prognosis is not good. Has anyone else had similar diagnosis and success?  Feeling a bit negative and very tired with sore watery eyes too. ",

      "Content": "Hi. I have just been diagnosed but using my mum and cousin as a benchmark. They both had invasive cancer and both got through it. If they can do it so can we. Just think that if you are offered treatment then that is a positive. Some people do not get that option. My way of coping is my five year old, the housework and going to work. Getting a new bike on the bike2work scheme to encourage me to get fresh air and exercise. Everyone has down days but you just have to count your blessings and get moving, not always easy I know x",

      "Content": "Hi, I have just had second session of FEC-t and I have to say have been really lucky with the side effects. Mild nausea and taste changes for first week, then just mild tiredness after that. Have still been able to take my five year old out for bike rides and dog walks and ten pin bowling etc. As for actually having the chemo, being a bit needle phobic, I just look away when the needle is put in my hand, then I am fine after that. Just sit there drinking water and eating starbursts ( opal fruits to the older ones amongst us) and after an hour of drug infusion it's all over and you can go home. It's just the waiting around before that is a drag as they are never running on time. I would say there is nothing to be terrified about at all and I won't even watch operations on TV! Good luck for Wednesday xx",
