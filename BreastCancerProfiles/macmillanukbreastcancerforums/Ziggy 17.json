      "Content": "Hi. For me Letrazol  was intolerable  and I was as usual rebellious about another  load of  side effects and swerved Tamoxifen for a few weeks.  Can honestly  say it's not too bad..occasional hot flushes and some headaches but Not crippled and doing my thing! Bless you ",

      "Content": "I had stage 2 and mascetomy in February  last year followed by full lymph nodes clearance in April.  Didn't want the second  operation  but lovely friend supporting me was insistent! Still feel aggrieved that only 1 /2 lymph nodes were affected out of the  total  15 i.e  all removed as I had endless problems with  fluid  build up and  subsequent  infections.  I refused Chemo but HD radiotherapy.  I don't  have a support network at home and couldn't imagine dealing with 5 effect of chemo on my own.  And I needed to say no to the endless hospital intrusion and get some control back.  I guess  lots of you will think that's crazy but surely it's about quality  not quantity of life? I'm not doing bad so   far..arm stronger and trying to stay  positive ",
