      "Content": "Hi thanks for your reply, somewhere on this site someone said its a club no one wants to belong too !!  how true, every step has been scary, what started with me being told it would be a lumpectomy, ended up with a bilateral mastectomy with right under arm clearance as it had got into the nodes.. every clinic appointment I was told of another problem, found I started to shake as I walked into the building, there was a point where they were concerned about my liver, all clear now, but a few days of pure panic..Im three weeks post surgery now and coming on well,,just want to get off this ride as im sure everyone does, but as I say to myself every day is a day closer to being well again.. Big Hugs back to you, and thank you again xxxx",

I'm now halfway through chemo, with radiotherapy to follow. Next appointment with surgeon in August to book date and take expanders out and replace with implants. Then fingers crossed I can put all this behind me.. it's a hell of a journey as, many of the lovely ladies on here can vouch for !!! Feel free to ask questions if I can be of any help Jane x",
