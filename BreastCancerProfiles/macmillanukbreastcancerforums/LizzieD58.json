      "Content": "Hooray. Just found this group. I'm a potter at heart but can't really take that into chemo with me! I dabble with a few things but am too cack handed for knitting or crocheting. I've just started needle felting but need a lot of practice. However, on a needle felting day I can rack up over 20,000 steps on my Fitbit without leaving my chair. Makes me feel smug when I tell my husband!  I'm loving the knitted knockers and will be purchasing some in several colours when the time comes. Thanks folks.",

      "Content": "Thank you Ronstar, this is very helpful. I might print it out and take it with me! PICC line in on Wednesday and chemo starts on Thursday. I can't say I'm not still scared but I seem to have come to terms with it and just want to get on with my treatment. I do have a few questions though... How long do the chemotherapy drugs stay in your body? I read that ti is a good idea to drinks lots of water before, during and after the chemo session but I don't want to dilute the drugs that are going to shrink my cancer! Does anyone have any suggestions please? Also. I've spent the weekend cleaning the house top to bottom, disinfected the switches, remotes - you name it, I've disinfected it! Can anyone suggest anything else I need to do to give me the best chances? I eat a healthy diet, walk most days and don't drink! I've been shopping for some kit items - books, magazines, mints, ginger. hand cream. Anything else? Thanks for your support - it really helps.",

      "Content": "Hi all. I tried to post last night but think the maintenance may have stopped it from being posted. I start chemo next week and am terrified.. It is worse at night when I can't think about trying to get to sleep beacuse I wake later with terrors. Shaking, feeling sick and crying. Last night I cried for three hours. I don't want to do chemo any more. My pharmacist gave me information about the drugs I shall be on (FEC-T) as I am also Type 1 diabetic, but it scared me even more. It says there should be tests before treatment - ECG for one but nobody has said I will have one. Can anyone give me a time line of what should happen before chemo please? I have my Intoruduction to Chemo course on Monday but I've had two weeks of worrying and don't want to ask stupid questions in public. My GP has been useless, although I did get Citalopram yesterday but it takes three weeks to work. I haven't slept since diagnosis, can't stop crying and now really don't want to go through with this. I'm worse when there is nobody to talk to. Help please.",

      "Content": "Thank you all, you have been so reassuring. My consultant has agreed to an ECG as there is a family history of heart problems and I think she forgot to ask about my heart! Neither my husband or I remember her talking about it. A nurse friend suggested drinking camomile tea during the afternoon and valerian before bed. It seems to have done the trick and I slept much better last night. We'll see what next week brings but I'm glad its the weekend, so no appointments or phone calls from medical places! I'm doing a painting course tomorrow and really looking forward to it. Some relaxation before it all starts next week.",

      "Content": "Hi all, I had my second FEC - T chemo on Friday and, so far, have had very few side effects. Much better than last time when I was quite nauseus and light headed for a few days. I went out to the pub for lunch yesterday to celebrate my birthday! For those with sore mouths, I found the Aloe Vera toothpaste and mouthwash from Holland and Barrett absolutely brilliant, mush less stingy than the mouthwash they gave me and it cleared up my sore mouth really quickly. I also rinsed with a small teaspoon of Manuka Honey which instantly eased the discomfort, but only for a few days as I'm diabetic! I had to count it for my insulun! Re PICC line discussions, I was worried about it but have found it to be fine once I got the dressings right. Now I don't notice it and you certainly don't feel anything when they do it. I quite enjoyed watching what they were doing on the screen and found it fascinating. But then I did ask to see what the biopsy looked like too! Hoping for a bit of sunshine and not too many horrible side effects for all of you going through this. Keep up the great support on this forum - it is a big help.",

An amazing resource on my doorstep. Will be trying to get into a make up session there as they are booked up for a year at MacMillan at BRI! Hoping I won't need it in a year! Re hair, my husband used clippers. I read somewhere not to use a razer in case of cuts and infection. Have a good day everyone.",

I found it quite liberating not having to wash or style my hair every morning and now I'm having fun with hats and scarves. My friends tell my they look better on me now than when I had hair and that i have a nice shaped head! I was terrified of losing it  but really don't mind now that I've taken control. A lovley lady i met trying on hats and wigs at oncology said she did the same and felt much better for it.",

My oncologist was not at all concerned about any of the supplements I take - she has even suggested a website to look up cancer and other herbs and medicines! https://www.mskcc.org/cancer-care/diagnosis-treatment/symptom-management/integrative-medicine/herbs/search?letter=A I wouldn't suggest anyone just starts taking things but as I was already taking them, it seems that they are no problem. I take liquid iron, vitamin D, cod liver oil, manuka honey and a vitimin combination (B vitamins) to help with back pain.",
