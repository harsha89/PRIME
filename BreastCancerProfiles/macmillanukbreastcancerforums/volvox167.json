I used to spin and do bootcamp, circuit and metafit but because i was working hard and training for the rowing comp I gave them up.It is something i hope to go back to.  Its good to hear that you are back running, I think i have to also try to walk when i can. Good luck with your training Regards Volvox",

Someone famous i can't remember who said, set the bar very low and you will always achieve it, Set it high and you won't always get there, but if you keep trying you will achieve much more in the end.  Goals are important you are correct. I have to believe there is a chance, it keeps me sane Hugs to you too",

      "Content": "Ronstar, Thankyou for your post, It is a tough time for all of us. I did consider not having any reconstruction as i wantedt to get back to everything as soon as possible. It is interesting what you are saying as it is not automatically the easier option which i thought it might be.  As it happens i have decided to have a reconstruction in the end ,but it was difficult decision. I hear you when you say you may have pushed yourself too hard. Thats what we do if we are competitive in life before cancer. We push ourselves through the pain barrier, we get injuries and lactic acid build up. I have almost thrown up after many rows but have got a pb. We are then faced with this situation where we have got to forget the pushing, and the training and we have to be sensible. But it is hard to do. The desire to get back is very strong, its a motivator but also a curse. I really wish you luck with your recovery, Just got to keep going. Volvox",

The fact that you worked through chemo is another thing which hopefully i will manage if i have to.  I am a wildlife surveyor i cover vast distances when surveying out in the field but perhaps i will be able to do some of the easier work which involves standing ( probably sitting now!) and watching buildings. I wish you a good recovery. Hugs to you you too. xxx",

I know what you mean when you can't get near personal bests it is tough, even when you know the reason.  Rock climbing is a sport as mine is, which requires strong arm and back muscles. I think the message overall from the posts is keep trying, don't give up, and build up to it all again. It requires patience, and accepting that it will take a long time. To begin with i thought i would be competing next November but it might be the November after now.  But I will do it. I am waiting for a surgery date for the mastectomy, lymph node removal and reconstruction. I also have to have chemo. Just got to be strong. We all have.  I wish you well  Volvox",

I am self employed and have a physically very demanding job. Now 3 weeks on i am thinking maybe i can get it back.  If I can just get through the treatment maybe i can work back up to where i am now. I have to have a mastectomy and i am waiting the results of the lymph node biopsy to see if i can have the reconstruction at the same time. I am undecided sometimes,  if i don't have reconstruction maybe i have a better chance of getting back. I really don't know. But can i live with only one breast? people do it. ",

      "Content": "Thankyou Kacang I have just read the article by Dr Peter Harvey it has been very helpful. People say constantly that i am a \"strong person\" I run my own business I push myself to the limit physically but i can't control what is happening to me now. That in its self is hard to accept. I have just realised that being anxious about being anxious is a waste of energy I keep trying to calm myself down. Its ok to be anxious its going to be tough and i can't fix this and being upset is actually normal.  The chemo is obviously a really a big thing, I am waiting for the lymph node biopsy results when i get that i will know the next stage at least.  I am starting to face up to the reality of it all. I am looking closely at the reconstruction options, I think nothing, or the stomach fat flap option.I don't want to lose muscles.  But the big thing reading everything is the chemo and it isn't about pushing myself and trying hard.  Dr Peter Harveys article has made me think maybe a change of lifestyle might no be so bad and is something i may have to consider. He articulates everything so clearly, and its ok to feel less than brave and strong all the time, it is a hard thing to experience and recover from. You have actually helped, Thank you.",

It hasn't been as bad as i worried it would be. i have my sessions 3 weeks apart. With the first 3 had nausea for about 5 days. took the anti nausea meds haven't been sick as yet. Was perfectly ok 2 weeks out of 3. With the 4th less nausea more fatigue. I do yoga every day I think it really helps. If i miss i start to ache particularly my neck and back. I do 15 mins stretching at least but usually do about an hour slowly. I try to do 30 mins exercise also on my exercise bike or walking and sometimes i just put music on and dance round the table. Mad I know but i find it lifts my spirits. I was utterly terrified of the chemo but i have luckily not been that bad. I really believe that the exercise helps me.  Its a horrible thing to go through overall but you do get through it. So hugs and good luck. XX",

      "Content": "Good Luck Kathryn .b with your op. I had a DIEP flap reconstruction mastectomy and lymph node removal on the 10th of Dec. I am fully healed now, had a slit blip with the abdomen but it is ok now. I have had to have chemo and it has slowed down the healing a bit. I cant believe how good the results are, it has been such a positive thing in the midst of everything else. That may sound strange as losing a breast is pretty horrible, however i look at the results and i am happy. The breast is a good match i have sensation in most of it apart from a small circle and I can wear tops which show  a bit of cleavage! You really cant tell. It makes me feel normal, My stomach is flatter than it has been for about 30years. It was tough going in hospital for the first 3 days very uncomfortable but you know what it was worth it i would do it again. I haven't needed counselling because of my op. I did however need counselling because of the hair loss. I found it totally devastating i still cry about it most days. I had lovely long hair, cold cap failed, i would have done anything to keep my hair. We all have so much to cope with its so tough, but hey we will survive.   ",

I do admire them. it has gone now so in a way its easier now. I would have done anything to keep my hair, tolerated anything, but cold cap unfortunately wasn't working so it was foolish to continue.  I have had very few side effects, nausea for about 6 days which i take the medication for, some weight gain but apart from that i have been fine. Lucky i think so far. I have had 3 sessions now, the FEC bit of the therapy. the T bit is next don't know how i will be with that. The problem is no-one can predict how individuals will respond. You don't necessarily get all of the side effects. Someone advised me not to read them too much. Just check if you notice something.  I have a chart on the wall i cross each milestone off as i get through it and i am halfway now. Downhill from here. The last two things on my list are hair regrowth, and my target weight. the first was my op, the hair, and my 6 chemo sessions. i like to look at the progress it cheers me up. So good Luck Ruby Rose don't worry too much about side effects you are unlikely to get all of them, the nurses are also very experienced and can help manage any that you do get. Love  Marie",

Had Long hair in pretty good condition, people look at me in dismay and said \" Oh No not your hair its your crowning glory\" Lost it at the Oncology appointment over my hair. Well tried my best to save it but failed dismally. However at the stage where there is nothing worth saving anymore, and gone past upset.  Thought about getting rid of all the mirrors, and not going out for 18 months until I've got hair. But that is totally impractical and absurd. So bit the bullet put on the wig and went to quiz night. You know what? I don't think anyone noticed. Either that or they were being kind. Its really horrible but what choice do we have but to get on with it. I feel really ugly but have to be brave.",
