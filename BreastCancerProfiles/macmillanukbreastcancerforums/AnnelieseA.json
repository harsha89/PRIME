      "Content": "Can anyone shed some light on this for me? When I was diagnosed with BC I was told that my cancer was progesterone receptive and that after chemo I will go onto a 5 year course of hormone therapy and induced menopause. Does anyone know what the hormone is? I have read that this treatment is only 10% effective. Looking forward to any replies. Anneliese",

      "Content": "Thank you for the supportive words. I did go for walks not long after I got home from the hospital but that seems to have gone by the wayside. I will start again. I found it a little difficult due to the stretch in my abdomen from the tram flap surgery, luckily that is subsiding and I feel that I can practically stand up straight now. Chemo starts on 4th September - anticipating more low days when going through that. Let's hope the side effects don't hit me bad. Thanks again ladies more your kind words Anneliese xx",

      "Content": "Thanks Penny - my daughter returned home from a trip to the States today and I dragged her out for a walk. It was a long walk for me - 30 mins, and I felt both tired and revived by it. Will do it everyday. My husband has also planned a visit to Paris for the weekend before chemo starts. I am really looking forward to that. I have wanted to go for a while but he isn't a big fan of France, extra special that he is willing to go just to give me some happy times before chemo.

      "Content": "Today I feel a little low. Since being diagnosed with BC I have had a few low moments as should be expected but I feel I have dealt with my news fairly well, trying to stay focused. I am doing my arm exercises as instructed and each day my mobility improves a tiny amount. Yesterday I pushed it a bit and my husband massaged my arm to help relieve the cording but this morning when I woke up my armpit was throbbing and I find it difficult to move. I know it sounds petty but this has left me feeling very low and tearful. My husband is being very supportive but I can sense he is getting frustrated at me asking lots of silly questions and expecting things to heal faster than they are. I know it will all come with time. Sorry for rambling and thank you for 'listening'",

      "Content": "Hi all - I joined the site today and have tried to read as many posts as my tired eyes will allow but I still would like to ask my question. I had a mastecomy and axillary clearance and tram flap reconstruction 2 weeks ago. For the first 2 days post op i didnt get the chance to do any exercises and then since then I have tried to do the exercises every day - some days better than others. I find I get a shooting pain up my arm when I try to do them and this puts me off and I dread doing the exercises. I take pain killers beforehand to help but this doesn't always work. I also found that once I came home after a week in hospital the tissue surrounding my boob on the outside and up into my armpit has turned very hard and when I try to do my exercises this hardness is very restricting. Is this normal? My breast care nurse says it is probably blood clots and tissue trying to repair itself but I hadn't heard of this as a side effect. I was expecting a lot of swelling and numbness which I still have but nothing that concerns me. I would appreciate it if anyone else who has experienced this let me know how they got on. Cheers Anneliese",

      "Content": "Hi Alison - thank you again for your reply. I saw my breast care nurse the other day and she has told me that what I have is scar tissue and I need to massage it quite vigorously everyday to break it down and the pain is cording, which I thought was a trapped nerve. The exercises are definately helping if very slowly. I do notice when I have missed a session. Today I went to see the oncologist. She has told me that my tumor was only 22mm and it had a clear margin of healthy tissue surrounding it. When they did the axillary clearance they found one node with substantial cells in it but the cancer hasn't spread into the vascular system, which is a relief. I am having a course of chemo - FEC-T x 3 and T Treatment x 3 then onto hormone therapy as I am Progesterone positive. She is also going to look into the possibilty of genetics playing a part seeing as 3 generations of my family have suffered with cancer. On the whole I have come away feeling very positive. Not looking forward to the side effects of treatments, if any, but I will take things one step at a time I guess. Sorry to ramble but it feels good to off load. Thanks, Anneliese",
