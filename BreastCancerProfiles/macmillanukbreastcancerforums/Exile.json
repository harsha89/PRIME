      "Content": "Hi, am new too but had RT 2 and half years ago. I did use aqueous cream or Aloe vera (the real one) + cotton vest tops-no bras, especially the wired sort- What helped too was the use of cool water straight on my return home from RT. I din't suffer too many side effects except for fatigue and some burning under the breast. It is still visible now and I haven't been in the sun on the beach  without  cover. At  that time  I was advised to drink green and white tea (antioxydants). I believe it has helped and still drink these! All the best, take care x",

      "Content": "Last November, following neo-adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy, I had an operation called a 'hookwire therapeutic mammoplasty' which is a kind of lumpectomy and cosmetic reduction all-in-one. In a couple of months time, I will go back to see the surgeon to discuss the pros and cons of having a reduction to my other breast and I would like to hear from anyone who went down this route and whether it is was a success or otherwise. There is a considerable difference between the size of my two breasts and I know that from an aesthetic point of view I will look and feel more feminine (not to mention being able to wear a proper fitting bra!) but I can't help feeling that at the end of the day the operation is not clinically necessary.",
