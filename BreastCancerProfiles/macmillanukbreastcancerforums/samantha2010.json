There is another thing to consider once you've finished chemo, RT etc is this new initiative to support women after treatment. I've done it and it helped me so much to get my life back on track and to feel confident again. If you want to know more, go to www.lylac.net I\u2019ve done the one-to-one support myself about 6 months after my latest treatment when I felt lost in life. I\u2019ve been looking for a long time to find appropriate support but couldn\u2019t find any until I heard about this new support programme. My \"lylac journey\" has been absolutely fascinating and it really helped me to get my life sorted again! You have to pay for the service and I can now say; it has been absolutely worth it. My coach mentioned that they also have places for low income if you can\u2019t afford it. Hope this helps. Samantha2010 Â ",
