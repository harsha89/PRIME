    "Content": "Dear Hewer   I can't believe your GP prescribed anti depressants for hot flushes bought on the the menopause!   It sounds like you are hot not depressed. Have you tried acupuncture for hot flushes?  It worked for me I had 6 sessions offered to me by my hospital.  As long as you see a therapist that knows what they are doing I understand this method has helped many women reduce the intensity and frequency of the flushes.  I used to have 8 or 9 during the night and that has reduced to about 3.   What seems to happen is that the flush is aborted mid way through so you don't experience the full flush as it were.   Best of luck   Bexy ",
