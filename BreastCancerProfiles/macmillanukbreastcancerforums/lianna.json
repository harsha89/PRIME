      "Content": "I just guess they may be being cautious with me as mines a grade 3 :) I wish she encouraged it too but if i have to go bold for my health so be it :) It could be the drugs she mentioned tho too FEC i think she said maybe a cold cap just wont work! You know what itds like when you go for a appointment you take tsome things in and not others! x Funny story was when the surgeon explained my first op to me the only thing that stuck in my head was great im going to be dyed blue like a smurf lol (unfortunatly I didnt go blue all over which at the time possibly would of made me chuckle!) x",

      "Content": "Im due to start chemo in the next two weeks and enquired with my nurse about a cold cap but she recommended for safety that I didnt use one incase i had a rogue cell up near my head and the cold cap prevents the chemo from working properly! Has anyone else had this advice? I thought the cells were in my booby not my head lol. I am only 32 though so I dont know if they are edging on precaution with me x",
