      "Content": "Hi Teresa polo,I've just read your post and wanted to reassure you that the sentinel node injection sounds awful but it isn't.i had mine the day of my mastectomy and was dreading it.they numb the area with a spray and then do the injection which only takes seconds and stings just a little.im a complete worrier but it really was ok.the waiting for the op was awful just try and keep busy.im waiting for chemo now! All the best you will get through it.x",

      "Content": "Hi Edan, glad you decided to come on the site. I have found the site very helpful over the last six months and am sure you will too. There is always someone who can give you a bit of helpful advice or give you words of encouragement when you are feeling low. I also begin radiotherapy shortly as Ive just completed chemo but it doesn't worry me as much as chemo did. Can I ask you how long you had to wait from when chemo ended to you starting radiotherapy? There you go, only just joined the site and you are being asked for advice! I think cancer is a very lonely place at times even when you are surrounded by a large family, know one can get into your head and understand actually how you feel, but ladies who have been through what we have can emphasise better. A big hug sent to you. X",

      "Content": "Hi Carrie, I really feel for you as I, like some of the other ladies, found loosing my hair was very distressing! I too went for the pixie cut first but just wasn't prepared for how much hair was still on my head ready to fall out. Everyone is different and I think you will reach a point like I did and think enough is enough and go for the shave. My head was sore too especially on my crown which made sleeping uncomfortable but once it had been shaved it did feel better. I'm facing my fourth chemo tmw, I have a few wispy white hairs on my head and still have my eye lashes and eye brows but I will put my wig on(which I still don't feel confident in but everyone says they can't tell). I hope knowing your not alone in feeling so emotional about your hair helps a little. Sending you a hug. Xxx",

      "Content": "Hi Deirdre, like you And I'm sure all of the ladies on here can emphasise with you about feeling really anxious at times. My worst time for feeling overwhelmed by fear,to date ,was before and during my first chemo. I got palpitations, couldn't think of anything but cancer and what the future may hold. One thing that really helped me was downloading relaxation apps which I listened to ,if anything just to take my mind off everything. The most useful one was by Jason Stephenson called 'guided meditation for acute anxiety '. I listen to it still, especially when I can't sleep it does seem to calm me down. I do seem to manage my anxiety better but there are days when I'm constantly thinking \"what if?\" But I push it away the best i can and I try to keep busy, I've never done so much cooking and cleaning!.Hope it helps to know you are not alone in how you feel and I guess we all find our own coping strategies and perhaps they get better as time goes by. Sending a hug.xx",
