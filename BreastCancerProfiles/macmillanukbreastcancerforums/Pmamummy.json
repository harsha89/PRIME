      "Content": "Hi, Its Epirubicin and Cyclosphosphamide. NO other health issues before this. I just didn't expect the first dose to knock me as much I guess. The sickness was bad the first day and I ended up in A&E for more anti sickness and fluids and thankfully have not been sick since! My head is tingling and feels like its in a clamp a lot of the time. Other drugs are:GCSF Lenograstim  (today is last day of these injections for this round), Ondansetran, Dexamethasome and Domperidone",

      "Content": "I had my first dose of EC chemotherapy last Thursday. I knew going in that sickness would be an issue (and it was), since then I've felt tired and fairly light headed. All I can taste is salt in everything and I can't satisfy my thirst. Are these regular side effects that will continue through, are  there any others I should watch out for and any tips on how to deal with any of them? Thanks for any advise x",
