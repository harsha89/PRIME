      "Content": "Hi, I'm a 65 year old woman who has been taking HRT patches for ten years but when I went for my 3 year mammogram, they called me in for a biopsy saying there was a cluster of cells that showed up. I had the biopsy and went back to the hospital a week later to be told they still didn't have my results yet so I had to wait another 10 days, despite telling them we had a holiday booked in two weeks to Florida.   When I went back 10 days later it was confirmed it was breast cancer (despite not having a lump) and I have since cancelled our holiday (I cried for a week!) and had a lumpectomy done (two weeks ago) and am healing from that. I was told to come back for the results ten days later, so I went back yesterday for the results only to be told they didn't have them back yet..... (2nd time this has happened) so now I have to wait another week. This is Boston in Lincolnshire hospital which is half an hour's drive away. Obviously I'm rather disappointed that they couldn't have let me know before driving all the way there, but never mind. I suppose the waiting is the worst and not knowing now what the treatment will be or if I will need another operation to remove my lymph nodes or not. A friend who had this done in Sheffield had her lumpectomy done there and whilst she was still under the anaesthetic, they tested what they took out there and then and diagnosed what type of breast cancer she had and identified that it had spread and she immediately had the lymph nodes taken out during the same operation. Why can't all hospitals follow the Sheffield example instead of telling us to wait so long for our results? Rather annoyed at the difference a postcode can make...   P",

Yes our minds play tricks on us sometimes when we had a shock but as you say, this will make us all stronger in the long term. You never know what\u2019s around the corner but glad that 95% of all Breast cancers are treatable, it gives us hope. All the best Penny xxx",

I had to Google SNB but still don't know what an mx is or WLE is?  I didn't realise that I had an SNB until joining this forum.... Maybe I should read up more about it. When you say \"clearance\" is that the same as removing the lymph nodes?",

I wonder if they reopen the old wound to do the 2nd op? No doubt I will find out soon. All the best of luck to you xx ",

The statistics for Breast cancer are pretty good as they say95% of all Breast cancers are treatable. Like you I\u2019m hoping I won\u2019t need chemotherapy but they already said I will have radiotherapy but that\u2019s pretty standard even if it hasn\u2019t spread to the lymph. Good luck with your results, let me know. It\u2019s comfortin to know there is this great support network and you don\u2019t feel so alone.... Penny",

We had booked one week at Universal studios and one week at Disneyworld then renting a car and driving down to the Keys. It's been a dream of mine to go there and been saving for years. I managed to get most of my money back from the insurance thanks to the hospital writing a nice letter. England is currently below zero at the moment so Florida sounded more inviting lol",
