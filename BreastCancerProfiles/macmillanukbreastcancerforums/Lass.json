      "Content": "Heya, Just wondering if anyone had any experience with Chemo in pill form? If so, would you mind popping in to the following thread and helping Christus out with her questions about what they are called and which one is the \"better\" one? https://community.macmillan.org.uk/cancer_types/bone-secondary-cancer/f/bone-secondary-cancer-forum/164573/breast-cancer-with-bone-mets?Page=0#1232240 If you read through the thread, you'll see what she's been told and that she's having trouble with the site. So any first hand experience of any of the chemo pills that you care to share would be much appreciated. Thanks in advance for any help you can give! Lass Xx",
