      "Content": "Hi Debbie Answers to your questions, yes yes yes yes. I was a lot like you, chemo brain, anxiety attacks and they are caused by the anti sickness but if you are like me, you cant do without them for at least a week.  I was very weak as well and part of you wants to move and the rest of you says, \"who you kidding\" its become a pattern for me, 3rd chemo tomorrow, I am out like a zombie for a week then I start getting back to normal.  Hint, when you get the anxiety attacks, mentally push it away and hold your breath shortly until the loop in your chest goes down, also visualise happy thoughts and keep saying \"no panic attacks, repeat until it goes away and quickly change your mindset.  Its helped me although they havent gone away, they calm down.  Chemo is hard work mentally but doable. Good Luck and see you all in a week, back to Zombie land after tomorrow. Charmiexxx",

      "Content": "Hi Debbie Like you I have had a my 1st chemo on FEC and going on to T as well, I was Ok for the 1st 2 days then the anti sickness stopped working and I got quite ill and dehydrated but once I got the right drugs I was back to normal again however I find I get tired easily now. These side effects are so individual, I am hoping my 2nd on Tuesday with the right anti sickness will be better.  I too feel quite normal at times and a friend that I met when I was having surgery has been perfectly fine, except for tiredness which I heard will get worse but manageable.   Like you I wanted answers but I have come to understand that it is so very individual and so different to each person. I started losing my hair in my 3rd week, I would rub my head and it came out tangled around my fingers ( I had really curly hair), the front was balding a lot and the sides so I got my brother in law to shave it and I feel relieved and liberated as I did it and not chemo.  I will let you know how the next one goes Take care, Charmie xxx",

      "Content": "Hi Tracey I am on number 2 with number 3 impending on the 17th. I too like Karen must take my hat to the mothers out there who are able to cope through chemo as it is so tiring.   My 1st chemo was hard as I had the wrong anti sickness, its trial and error as we are such unique beings but they will get it right. So my 2nd was not too bad, I like Karen find it really hard in the week of chemo, i have no energy and just want to sleep but it is difficult and I am sure it has to do with the added drugs you take, unfortunately for me, the anti sicknes that does work for me give me anxiety attacks so I will try to change but most of them do, its my 3 trial, its seems I need 1 full week to re-coup then I am back on form slowly.  My advice is to listen to your body and eat, sometimes you wont feel like it but do as I now realise that the more i do, the better I feel, I have heard great views about fresh juices so I am investing in a juicer this weekend.    I also agree in trying to be careful about catching any viruses as it will set you back and if you are like me, you just want to get to end quickly so you can move on to the next stage of your life.  As for the hair, I found it was hard but once it started I couldnt wait to chop it off as the itching and tingling was driving me mad once it started to fall, this happened in my 2nd week, after chemo 2, it went really fast, my legs, arms and pubic have all stopped growing and bits of fluff are hanging on to my head for dear life, I personally think I look like an Emu bird and laughed senselessly at myself, you have to laugh it off, I keep telling myself its only hair and a small price to pay for my life but no doubt it wasnt easy at first.  Explain to the children whats happening sensitively, I think the worse thing would be to try to hide it, its too much for you to bear and kids sense when you are not being truthful, expain its temporary and a journey and make them part of it. I am not a Mom but I think this is what I would do. Good luck and God Bless and keep us posted, Wishing you the best results. Charmiex",

      "Content": "I agree with Sue. Ask for a examination at the doctor, if you continue to examine yourself every few days eventually you will get to know your breast and if any changes are there you will know. I have a very agressive tumor and it literally grew overnight and within 2 months it had double in size, I didnt know what I was searching for but thank goodness I was checking it and I knew something was not right. You will know and if you are unsure of anything ask the doctor a million times, its is what they are there for. Good luck and congrats on the little one. Charmie",
