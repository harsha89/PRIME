      "Content": "thanks for the warning about work Polly, I am trying to be good! I still get ridges behind my knees even with the larger stockings but not as bad as the smaller ones. I'm rather a large person and need the ex large stockings but I think the problem is that they are made for taller ppl with longer legs so the stockings tend to roll down behind the knee which makes them even tighter. I did wonder about cutting an inch or so off yhr top of them but wont do that till after my post op appointment tomorrow so they dont see what I've done lol. On the other hand I might try to persuade them to let me stop wearing them as I'm pretty active now. Good luck with your recovery and I hope you get your stockings sorted out xx",

      "Content": "Hi Polly, I've just popped over from the womb cancer group because I read your email and feel such sympathy for your mum. I had a hysterectomy two weeks and my surgeon made me promise to wear my stockings for six weeks fay and night. Of course that was for abdominal surgery which may carry more of a risk of blood clots than breast surgery. However within a few days the stockings were driving me mad, so uncomfortable . I'm telling you This because I rang my nurse and she sent me a larger size which are much much better.i still cant wait for the six weeks to be up but at least they are bearable now! Xx",
