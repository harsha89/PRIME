Fantastic as i wanted to help myself.  Sorry if im making mistakes as i had my 2nd FEC yesterday so didnt get any sleep with the colic pains etc. Jenny",

Looking at it not as toxic but something to make me better....bring it on :) I went to the Penny Brohn charity in Bristol on Monday. Brilliant resource centre in a non NHS environment but with Gps and oncologist ,dieticians etc available. I really relaxed there. They have centres all over uk and i will definetely use it again. They do a 2 night residential which again is all free, my cousin used it 20 years again and introduced me to it. jenny x",

I was told by the oncology dietitians that i could take a low dose of D3 max 400iu but avoid it 2 days before and 2 days after the chemo day as we need it and dont get a lot of sun. im avoiding everything else ie vit c as im hoping i getting that from pomegranate juice. I was also told about Herceptin being the bees knees and was not allowed it on FEC ans they can cause heart problems down the line but am starting it on my 4th session with Docetaxel and pertuzumab (which is supposed to be the new bees knees and different regions of bees!! This was prescribed by my initial oncologist but when i went to my first meeting I had another one who poo pood herceptin and the new drug , the breast care nurse spoke to me after as i came out so confused, She said they work very different but her experience of herceptin was that it was giving amazing results Anyone had experience of this lovely cocktail?
