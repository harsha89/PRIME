      "Content": "Hi Dianne, I found out in April about my breast cancer, It wasn't a shock because in my mind I knew in January (sounds stupid I know, but I know my own body) I had a right mx in May, I'm coping really well, but even though I'm in remission, deep down I know this blimmimg Cancer is hiding in my body somewhere !, although I'm not scared, so I can understand why your feeling this way, just don't let this feeling ruin your life, live and laugh everyday. Hugs to you Chelle x",
