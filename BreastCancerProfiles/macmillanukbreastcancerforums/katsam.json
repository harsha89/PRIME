    "Content": "Hi Lindy I am a newbie too . I am 65 and was diagnosed last August . I have had a lumpectomy and radiotherapy, which finished just before Xmas. I also had the wire to locate the lump before my op. I can assure you for me the op and other procedure was a diddle. After my radiotherapy I had some burns under my arm , which turned out to cause me more bother than the surgery, but I am fine noe. I don't see my surgeon till August now. The only problem I have now is my own demons . The fears and anxiety but that is something I have to deal with myself. I am also on tamoxifin for five years and I got the all clear on the biopsy of my lymph nodes , so I am sure you will be ok. I wish you all the best for your op day .",
