Five years down the line and I know that it is possible to overcome this - survival rates for BC are brilliant! Waiting is, as said before, is the worst part but you are at the start of a journey... If you have immediate questions do remember the wonderful nurses here on this site who are on hand to answer questions. They operate Monday to Friday 9am to 8pm on freephone 0808 808 0000.

Thank you. Joycee",

It is annoying but we generally laugh - explain to people that we're on a drug which screws with our memory and they are very understanding. Best wishes KateG",
