      "Content": "Hi, I have been on this site numerous times since my mum was diagnosed with breast cancer about 1 month ago and it has been really helpful and has kept me away from google!. Her cancer was grade 2 and stage 2 and 1 node was positive so she is now having further surgery to remove all lymph nodes and a further scrape from where the lump was removed as the margin had one remaining cancer cell. I was feeling really positive until my mum mentioned a couple of days  ago that she was told after initial surgery her cancer is actually stage 3. I now feel really scared again especially as it is in her lymph node as well. I have strayed onto google again but struggled to read much positive information especially when looking at statistics (I know I shouldn't pay attention to these as a lot are based on old data). I would really love to hear some positive stories from people who have/have had stage 3 breast cancer with nodes affected so I can get all of the negative thoughts out of my head and continue to provide my mum with all of the positive support she needs. Thanking you in advance x",

      "Content": "Hi, my mum was diagnosed with bc in October. After lumpectomy and further op to clear margins and remove lymph nodes it has been confirmed as stage 2, grade 3 tumor, ER+. 4 lymph nodes involved but 2 had only micro deposits in them. At her first Ocologist appt last week she was told it was her decision whether she wanted to start chemo before or after Xmas but if it was his wife he would start it before. Mum had been looking forward to having a 'normal' Xmas but after she was advised side effects usually last 24 to 48hrs,so by Xmas day she should be feeling ok, she decided to go ahead and due to start chemo this Weds (FEC-T). She had a call today from her bcn and she told my mum she didn't want her to feel pressured into starting chemo and it would make no difference if she would prefer to wait until after Xmas (prob start between 27th Dec and 1st Jan). She advised her that with her first FEC she could feel fine first 1 to 3 days and then the side effects could hit her so she could feel at her worst over Xmas. Now my Mum is wanting to put the Chemo off - will it really make little difference to delay a further week or is it best to start asap? From your experiences is the first FEC the worst and when do side effects usually start? I know everybody reacts differently but would just be really helpful to hear your opinions / experiences. Thanks for reading this rather long post!x",

      "Content": "Thank you so much for your replies. I am going with mum to hospital today and will now feel a bit happier if she does decide to wait. We all want her to start treatment asap so if there are any stray cells they don't get a chance to make themselves at home anywhere but at the same time we understand we have to respect mum's wishes. Love to you all and thank you to this site as it has helped me so much over past few weeks. I have told mum to join and hope she will soon as i'm sure it will help her too xx",

      "Content": "Hi Chrystaljuju, thanks for your reply. Mum hasn't had vascular invasion. I went with her today to see her bcn and she has now been booked in for her first chemo on 27 Dec. I would have preferred her to have gone ahead tomorrow but she explained everything has moved so quickly since being diagnosed (which is good) that she just feels she needs this break before starting on the next leg of the journey. If this means she will be in a better frame of mind to deal with it all then I don't feel I can pressure her to change her mind. I wish you well for your surgery and for a happy and healthy New Year xx",
