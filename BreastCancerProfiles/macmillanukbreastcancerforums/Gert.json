      "Content": "Remember what a huge event you've been through - not just the operation but the whole process, psychologically as well as physically. One last comment, from my experience & hopefully this might be different for you:  I found that the nerve pain didn't really kick in for a couple of weeks & then it was pretty uncomfortable for a couple of weeks.  I really hope that doesn't happen to you but, if it does, don't panic - it won't last forever.  Some very weird stuff might go on:  I had all sorts of burning & stabbing sensations & even a day of whirring - like an alarm going off in my chest! - which I can only assume was nerves sorting themselves out again.  Remember how much rummaging around has gone on in there! Take great care of yourself & I'm sure with each week that passes you feel stronger & stronger.",

      "Content": "Hey Stormy.  I just wanted to send a quick response to say that it DOES get better, just hang in there.  I had my left breast off on 5 Feb so pretty recent.  I felt completely & utter lousy for four weeks but then starting improving pretty dramatically - by six weeks, I felt pretty much human again. Obviously it varies for everyone but please don't beat yourself up:  you've had a MASSIVE trauma so it will take a while to feel even vaguely human again - the anaesthetic alone can take a while to get over. I was also a bit taken aback by how much pain I was in (stupid I know - why on earth wouldn't it hurt?!) but I felt that the hospital hadn't warned me that I would be taking as many painkillers as possible (not much codeine as the side effects of that for me are worse than the benefits but ibuprofen & paracetamol) for at least a month after the op.  I had pretty bad nerve pain, which worried me a bit as again I wasn't expecting it, but that's 99% gone now & most of the time I don't give my scar a second thought. As for the visuals, I know I'm unusual but my new shape doesn't bother me at all.  I opted not to have reconstruction & haven't regretted that for an instant.  I now don't give it a thought going out & about lop-sided.  But, again, I completely appreciate that I'm unusual in having this attitude. Take it easy on yourself.  If you can, just potter & chill & eat well & try to sleep for a few more weeks.  DO YOUR EXERCISES :-)  I promise you'll feel miles better in two, three, four weeks time ... Very best wishes x",
