    "Content": "Hello, I am newly diagnosed and have just been been advised that I will have to have further surgery this Thursday.  My surgeon needs to remove a 'wider margin' and will also be removing the remaining lymph nodes in my axilla, as the two he removed have been found to contain cancer.  He also tells me that the tumour was eventually 4.5 cm, to its' extemities.  I was orginally advised that t was 12x18mm. I would love to hear from anyone who has also had similar experiences, in either the second surgery, cancer in lymph nodes when the FNA was negative and/or the tumour being larger than at first thought.",
