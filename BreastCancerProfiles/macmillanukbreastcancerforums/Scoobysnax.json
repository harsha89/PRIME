    "Content": "Hi there  I had a PICC put in after my second chemo.  I was very nervous about it but the Nurses were great.  You don't feel any pain, but it's a weird sensation and you are aware of it being put in.  The Nurses burnt lavendar oil and put on soothing music!! My arm was sore at the site for about five days, but after that I didn't even know it was there.  You have to be careful with bathing, as you're not allowed to get it wet.  They give you plastic sleeves or tell you to wrap it up in cling film.  I choose to just have baths, as I felt I had more control about where the water was going. I didn't have any problems with infections, however my skin started to break down towards the end, as I was allergic to the dressing they used to hold it in place, also, the wound site began to get sore, but they may not happen to you, as I have very sensitive skin generally. I would definitely recommend it, as having bloods done etc was so easy. Good luck with it all :0)",
