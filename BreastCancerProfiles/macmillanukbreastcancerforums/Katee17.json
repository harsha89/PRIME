I suppose u r watching your diet and eating well for the constipation, I used to get that and still do so I take senakot and also laxido from gp. Have u tried manuka honey for the mouth sores? It helped me and u will also get mouth sores during tax. Stressing about it makes us worse and some people have posted about relaxation techniques that can help.

      "Content": "Hi all, I met the surgeon today and it was mixed news. They've been treating a lump near my armpit as breast cancer but the primary site is still not known which is a good thing they say. Basically the cancer is in a lymph node so she is going to remove the 4.5cm lump and up to 15 nodes and may have to cut the nerve under my arm as well - she won't know until she 'in'. I had 3 x FEC that didn't shrink it but the 3xT did a bit. I've signed the paper for the operation but now the questions and concerns are setting in. I'm concerned at the removal of so many nodes and the risk of lymphodema as well as movement in the arm and cording etc. has anyone had something similar, how have u managed, please let me know. thank u.",

First I had chemo, then surgery where they took out 22 nodes and all were normal and I didn't have masectomy. I don't have breast cancer as my primary site was and still is unknown. The unknown primary group is very quiet so I joined this group as onc is treating me like breast cancer. I'm seeing the radiologist on Monday. I may post a new discussion in case there r any other unknown primary ladies here who r similar to me. All the best, keep it up and u will be ok. x",

Perhaps if it shrunk more then they wouldn't need to remove so many nodes, I will ask my bcn if one more chemo would do that as much as I would dread that it may be better in the long run.    this forum is great isn't it, your replies have given me a boost and much needed company.
