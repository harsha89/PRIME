Everyone tells me I'm amazing but I don't feel it. I can't sleep don't want to eat but drink too much! Hoping this phase passes.Good luck to everyone going thro breast cancer treatment. It's so hard.",

      "Content": "I am 59 and had breast cancer with 3 lots of surgery, one of them being a mastectomy, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. I was a full time secretary prior to this. I have struggled so much being back at work. The fatigue is so debilitating. I would love to give up work but at the moment waiting till I'm 60 next March. I can get my pension then which is not enough to survive on. I could work part time 3 days a week to supplement it. What I wanted to ask does anyone know if in those circumstances and if my doctor would do a note saying I'm not fit enough to be able to work could I claim benefits? I feel guilty thinking this but at the moment I'm barely coping and just existing. ",
