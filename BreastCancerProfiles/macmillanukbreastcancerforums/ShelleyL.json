    "Content": "Wow, to think that 11mths ago I was diagnosed with secondary breast cancer. Grade 3, Stage 4. Seven cycles of chemotherapy, fifteen sessions of radiotherapy. I made it. I\u2019M STILL HERE. I\u2019m giving myself a shout-out, because you know what? Regardless of the days when I feel unsure, fearful, doubtful, look at what I survived - I can do anything. That\u2019s what I want to let YOU know, whatever cycle of chemo you\u2019re on, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, you can and you will get through it. Repeat those words, I Can and I Will. That\u2019s what got me through and if I can do it, with my needle phobia, with my anxiety, with my lack of self-confidence, SO CAN YOU. Hi, I\u2019m [insert name here] and This is My Story.",
