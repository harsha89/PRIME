      "Content": "Hi, I'm new here and feeling pretty lonely. Sat at home with the dog and trying not to cry. My mastectomy op has been delayed by 3 weeks due to a chest infection and the shooting pains in my breast have come back. I'm scared. It means the cancer is alive and kicking in there and it will be over 2 months since my last chemo before they operate. Also worried they will say no next time, I've had a week of antibiotics and feel no better. If they tell me no next time, I will cut it off myself. Cancer versus chest infection, I know which I'd rather have. So what if my chest gets worse, they can give me something for that can't they? Really stressed and sat here getting in a state. Xxx",

      "Content": "Thank you Nix, Yes I was wondering about different medication, I might go to my GP today. I will try and eat more healthily, have kind of lost my appetite lately, think it's partly stress and also the thought that I'm feeding the cancer, which I don't want to do. Food used to be my favourite thing, but it doesn't matter to me anymore.  Thanks for your help, Sparkydog. X",

Thanks for the info, if they had told me that at the hospital, it would have made more sense and me and hubby wouldn't have left upset (me) and angry (him.) Roll on 2017 and a fresh start. X",

      "Content": "Lynn, Good luck with the surgery, I bet it feels good having all the other stuff behind you. I haven't bothered the bc nurse, figure they don't need all my drama. I'm causing enough problems for the people who know me, with this stupid disease.  I think the worst part now is how long all this is taking, it drags on and on.  My boys are having nightmares and are scared I'm going to die, my mum is upset and she's elderly, I've messed everything up at work for my team, by not being there and my husband has been taken off his project as he can no longer travel for work, all because of me. He now wants to quit his job but can't, because my private health care is through his job. Cancer screwing with my life is one thing, but now I'm angry as it's messing with the people I love. Sparky dog. X ",

      "Content": "Thank you so much, that helps a lot. Especially the photo, made me cry. (Such a wuss.) Those poor ladies waiting 12 weeks, don't know how they do it. Feel like I'm going a bit cuckoo with all this, it's messing with my emotions. I hope the tumour is shrinking, it's just I had pains in my breast before chemo, so I just assumed it was a bad sign again.  I wish there was a DIY mastectomy kit, hate having to wait for others to decide my fate. Thank you for your kindness, off to hug dogger. Xxx",
