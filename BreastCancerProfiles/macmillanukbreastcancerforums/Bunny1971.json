      "Content": "Hi Jacki Firstly, you are a complete star by going back to work so quickly. I can only go by my own experience and hope it helps you.  I used to have my chemo on a Friday and on the Saturday, apart from being a bit spacey, I felt reasonably well.  However, the Sunday, Monday and Tuesday were the days that everything really kicked in - very sleepy, achey and weepy - all the usual stuff they tell you about.  By the Wednesday, things had started to improve though so hang in there. I was lucky in that my work allowed me to take off time the week after my chemo which I did - only returning the following Monday if I felt strong enough.  The week at home allowed me to wallow a bit and look after myself and be a bit selfish - definitely something you need to do.  To get through the week, I made sure that I kept my fluid levels up as much as possible, slept when I needed to and increased my intake of leafy, green vegetables - things that contained iron and potassium - try bananas - cant look at one now without wanting to throw it out of the window but apparently they worked as I managed to get through the whole six sessions relatively unscathed. Try not to beat yourself up too much and dont try and rush things - each person is different and will have a completely different experience with the treatment.  For instance, I didnt suffer too badly from sickness or sore throat/mouth but I had chronic indigestion and swollen, tingly feet.  All you can do, unfortunately, is go with the flow and keep counting down the days.  You've had one session so only so many more to go - I had a calendar with a gold star that my husband put on everytime I finished a session. Take care and know that we are here for you if things get tough",

      "Content": "Hi, I finished chemo in May and had my last radiotherapy at the end of June.  Since then I've had a pain in my left elbow - almost like I've done too much exercise.  Cant tell if its in the bone or muscle which is slightly strange.  Mentioned it to my oncologist and breast care nurse who didn't appear to be worried about it.  Said aches and pains can go on for a while but, if I was concerned or if it didn't settle, he would send me for a scan.  Did say that if your bloods were ok and not showing any marker signs then cancer anywhere else was extremely rare.  I'm actually supposed to have another CT scan in January so am thinking of leaving it until then unless the pain gets any worse. Good luck but never feel silly about asking questions.  Sometimes you just need reassurance.",

      "Content": "Hiya Firstly, good luck for today - hope chemo went well.  You may not feel any effects apart from tiredness on the first day - symptoms usually kicked in on the second day for me.  However, everyone is different and I was on a different regime than you - it was TAC for me.  I remember being really anxious before my first treatment but it wasn't too bad.   I wore my wig in between sessions and continued to wash my hair and bald head in baby shampoo.  In fact, I am still using this even though I have now finished by cycles.  Didn't go for the cold cap myself as I was told that with TAC it wouldn't help. Keep strong and hope it all went well.  Remember, we are always here if you need a hand to hold cyber wise.",

      "Content": "Hi Mom74 Welcome to the group. I'm just over a year from finishing 6 rounds of TAC.  It was the most pleasant experience but you can get through it, I promise.  I can only go by my experience but I hope it helps. The first day wasn't too bad, by days 2-3 I started to get 'chemo brain' and feel very drained, days 4-7 my energy levels started to return and I could more or less get back to a routine.  In fact I managed to come to work in London 3 weeks out of every 4 though it was tiring. I think the key for me was to try and do something every day, even if it was just washing up from the night before :)  I also kept up with moving around - I think I walked miles around my house and also forced myself outside for a short walk once a day when I could. The aches and pains in my legs did get me down occasionally especially when I had to take paracetamol (dont like doing that at the best of times) but again, a little exercise helped.  Did try yoga at home once which just ended up with me laughing as the positions were impossible :) I dont know if it worked or not but I upped my intake of fruit (bananas for potassium) and leafy green vegetables plus I drank loads of water.  Wasnt pleasant near the end as my taste buds made water have the consistency of milk but I kept going - kept dreaming of when I could drink a pint of milk or eat a bacon sandwich again :) Hope you're not feeling too bad - keep going - you have us behind you and you will get through it.

      "Content": "Hi Jaki17 Firstly, good luck with your chemo.  Its a bit daunting to start off with but, believe me, its surprising how quickly it becomes 'routine' and you sort of get used to it. I was lucky as I had my treatment privately but I was still at the hospital around 4-5 hours.  Depending on the chemo, you have to have various IVs changed and various intervals and also probably see the doctor.  I had to wait anything up to to half an hour to an hour for mine to to arrive to sign off before I could go. I was given tea/biscuits etc plus a small lunch but took sweets and a little snack pack too.  Would suggest a bottle too to keep hydrated.  Depending on the type of chemo, make sure you some mints or sucky stuff ready - one of the drugs gave me a really metallic taste in my mouth which I counter-acted with foxes glacier mints. Lots of reading material - I also took my tablet and headphones so I could watch films or tv that I downloaded.  As mentioned by other people, my Kindle become a lifesaver.   It is surprising how quickly time goes but it can be extremely boring. Hope it all goes ok and let us know how you get on. xx",
