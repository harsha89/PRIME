    "Content": "I was awarded pip in 2016 not for my BC as that was not an issue then for me it was for a heart attack and subsequent heart failure. I didn't feel the need to exaggerate my symptoms. I found my assessor to be very understanding and helpful and advised that if I had to go for follow up to use a taxi to get there. When my condition got worse and then diagnosed with the breast cancer I phoned up the pip office as I felt I should be on higher payment, following discussion on phone I was actually offered assessment in my own home.the assessor was extremely helpful and I didn't feel she was trying to catch me out,as I had previously been told she would.  I have heard many different stories about the assessments for me I found honesty and sticking to the facts the best way forward ",
