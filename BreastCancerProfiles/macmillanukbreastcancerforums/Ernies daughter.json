      "Content": "Hi there I'm really sorry you have been experiencing problems with your medication. Firstly I would like to say to members that I have never posted on here before, but have been a member for quite a while and look in from time to time. You asked for an honest opinion, well here is mine for what it's worth. I was diagnosed with breast cancer July 2015, had lumpectomy (wish they had taken my breast off but that is another matter) and 15 sessions of radiotherapy. They put me on Tamoxifen in September 2015 and after 6 weeks I started having gynae problems with it. I started 'spotting' then bleeding even though I was post-menopausal; had constant shooting pains running up through my vagina; plus my right eye became bloodshot a couple of times (the optician said I was the second person that week to have the problem on tamoxifen). I went for a pelvic and abdominal ultrasound scan early December 2015 because I was getting pressure pains in my pelvis and the result was that it appeared I had some thickening of my womb lining which is usually attributed to taking tamoxifen. By then I had had enough and stopped after just under three months. My breast care nurse and consultant weren't too happy but you do have a choice, but although I felt I was being pressurised I decided not to bother any more. Early last year I was still having pressure in my pelvis and to cut a long story short I had to have a hysteroscopy to see what was going on, luckily the gynae couldn't see anything but recommended I go in for surgery to remove my ovaries and fallopian tubes because of my family history. I started to feel well again about August last year, so a year after my lumpectomy I finally felt I could get on with my life again. My first mammogram last August was clear and I had a discussion with the breast care nurse who tried to insist that I try the AI's for a few years like Letrozole but I am unwilling to take anything ever again after the problems with tamoxifen. I do worry about my cancer coming back from time to time, but there are no guarantees in life and I understand there are many people who will take and do anything if they think it will help prevent it coming back, but it is not for me. I would just like to say this is only MY opinion as I know not everyone gets horrendous side effects like me. All I can say is do what feels right for you. Good luck. Lesley",

      "Content": "Well done on finishing radiotherapy. I finished mine 10 days ago and my skin held up throughout the treatment. They did say any problems would peak around 10-14 days AFTER treatment. I have been getting lots of shooting pains across my breast , and the scar where they took the lymph nodes out is feeling sore but I seem to be managing the pain with paracetamol and ibuprofen. I'm a bit of a worrier and expected the worst of everything but so far (touch wood) things have gone much better than expected. I keep slapping on the cream and hoping for the best:) Not much of a swimmer so cannot help you there. Lesley",
