Not looking forward to my steroid injection for the next 5 days but like everything else I often worry that things will be worse than they actually turn out to be.  Hope all you lovely ladies are doing well Take care of yourselves x",

      "Content": "It is all scary but I was advised by my breast surgeon to have a reduction which meant she was able to ensure clear margins on my cancer boob and at the same time a plastic surgeon took the same amount from my healthy boob. My lymph nodes were taken from a small incision just to the left. I had very little pain afterwards and 3 months later wounds were completely healed. I went from 36H to 36B. Operation also meant I had a lift and feel happy with the way they look. Silver lining to this horrible cancer cloud but at least I will have no further surgery. I am now 3 cycles into chemo.  I wish you well",
