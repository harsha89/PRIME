      "Content": "Hi all, Just looking for some advice please?? I had a mastectomy back in January, and had some lymph nodes removed. I did all the exercises as advised and got back to pretty much full movement. I then had my chemo, which finished in May this year - woo hoo! However, I have still have little or no feeling on the skin on my upper arm, it still seems swollen to me (definitely feels like it is) and have recently started to get pains in my area when moving it. It feels like its going back to how it was straight after my surgery. Tightening every time I move it. Has anyone else had this, and is it something I should worry about?? I am going to call the breast care nurses tomorrow but it has been going around my head all weekend that if I call them it will be wasting their time and I'm worrying over nothing! Any advice is greatly appreciated, Thanks Xxx",

      "Content": "Hi All, Wow! Thankyou all so much for all your advice. I know its a horrendous time for you all too but it is comforting to know i'm not alone. I have been told that i will be having the FEC chemo as i also have MS and normal chemo would affect that????? I luckily have a very good friend who is a hairdresser so i think (after reading all this) that i will go ahead and get it cut short. I have looked into donating to the Little Princesses and hopefully mine is long enough as i think its a fantastic thing to do to be able to make those little kiddies to maybe feel a bit more 'normal' while they get through it. I don't think i would cope with the cold cap as i am a complete wimp! But thanks Sarah. I hope all of your treatments go well and thankyou again, you've definately made me feel a bit more confident about it all :-) Love Lucy xxx",

I was diagnosed about a month ago, just after turning 30, and have been booked in for a full mastecomy on 3rd Jan, to follow with chemo and possible radiotherapy. Just wondered if there was anyone else who is still in 'limbo' and waiting for things to get started???? Considering cutting my hair short (which has always been long!) but then people keep saying 'what if you don't like it and then don't lose your hair? Any advice for a newbie please? Thanks, Lucy x",

      "Content": "Hi Lisa, Thankyou for your kind and reassuring words. I had my hair all cut off tonight, for the first time in my life i have short hair!!! (well its a short style graduated bob, but thats short for me lol). I am now in proud posession of a 9 inch pony tail which i have all wrapped and ready to send to the Little Princess Trust, and i must say that that alone has made me feel a whole lot better about it all!!! I hope you are doing well after your op? I'm scared stiff but also just want it done now!!Â  When is your gene test? I know its not easy, but i've found the best way so far is to only worry about the things that come next (for me is the op) and then i'll worry about chemo etc at a later date as there is nothing i can do to change or control it! Maybe try not to panic about the future until you come to that time when this is all over and you have fought your way back to 'normal'. You need to concentrate on you for now ;-) Wishing you all the best, have a lovely Christmas, and if you need a chat i'm here. xxx",

      "Content": "Hi Emnoo, wow reading this is just like reading my mind! I had just turned 30 in sept and was then diagnosed in nov. I have a 2 1/2 year old son and have had exactly the same thoughts as you! (although I haven't made it to the Ikea sale yet lol) if it makes you feel any better I had my mastectomy and lymph nodes removed yesterday. I don't want to tempt fate but I feel much better than I thought I would! Mentally and physically!. I also haven't cried properly yet as i feel I can't do it with others around and then feel really stupid when I'm on my own. I have also found that even if you feel you're being daft, if you look on here there are normally a lot of other people who are either going through the same thing or have come out the other side already. Everyone has been lovely who I have spoken to and I think it's a great site. Hope all goes ok for you and if you need a chat I'm here. Take care, love Lucy xxx",
