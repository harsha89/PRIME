      "Content": "Hi all, I had my last round of Nasty Mr 'T' on 13th October. I am all prepared to start Rads on Tuesday and have been feeling really positive and excited seeing light at the end of the tunnel, especially as having TNBC that will be it all done :-) Yesterday I started with the old familiar feeling wobble of T, last night I had an awful night, pain in all joints from base of skull to my ankles and this morning I am so dizzy I haven't even bothered to get dressed. Luckily my temperature is normal!! So my question is, is it usual/normal to have relapses like this? Thanks in advance ladies Nikki x",

      "Content": "Hi Nadjie, Thank you so much. I saw Onc on Thursday a she said the Chemo will be in my system for up to a year, but nothing about the side effects hanging on.....maybe I was having a chemo brain moment and wasn't listening properly!! I have all of the things you mentioned, its the pain that I find hardest to deal with! My toe nails seem ok just now, but I have 6 finger nails and a thumb nail flapping around, not attractive!! I will speak to the radiologist on Tuesday before they start just to be on the safe side, thanks for the reassurance xx Nikki P.S. I will follow your link xx good luck xx I did the London Bikathon a couple of years ago......never again :-)",

      "Content": "Hi Nina, I have been dipping in and out of this site since my diagnosis. I have become a very selfish person and have great difficulty taking on other people's 'issues'!! (In normal life  am a care giver!). I found your thread and it has been SO helpful. I'm not going mad, it really is c**p for all of us!! I have had my first T, I had my 3 FEC first and although I HATED FEC, I have to say I am now at the point of deciding it this B*****d comes back I don't want to do this ever again. I seemed ok for the first couple of days then this weekend BAM!! I know how bad I look by seeing how bad hubby looks! He has been asking me to describe how I feel......other than battering him with a golf club and then making him run a marathon what can I say?? I am not a nice person to be around anymore and although I keep blaming the drugs I can't ever imagine feel 'normal' again..........(only people on this site can say hang in there, your over half way through.........coz if you haven't experienced it you really have no idea, even a best friend!) I have the sorest fingers from the tips to the base of the nails, I cant even get my pain killers out of the blister pack. The sore/dry/white tongue is horrible, but I found Rossi Ice cream and strawberries cuts through it and is so refreshing. So in short Nina, thank you for sharing and I really hope the addition allergic reactions you have on your face and hands calms down xx luv grouchy macaway x",
