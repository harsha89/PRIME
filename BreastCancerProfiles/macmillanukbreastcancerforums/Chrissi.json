I am not a big eater and what I do eat is healthy.  Lots of fruit, veggies, protein, salads etc.  I don't eat between meals and rarely have cakes,biscuits chocolate sweets etc.  I drink peppermint tea, diet coke sometimes and wine/G&T, perhaps once a week. I walk, go to red hot yoga 2/3 times a week too but the weight just keeps coming. I hate how my body has changed, my tummy is especially bad but it's all over, my legs, bottom and even on my back and from what I can find out it is going to get even worse. Has anyone experienced the same? What or is there anything more you can do to help yourself? Chrissi P x",

      "Content": "Hello Kate    Many thanks for your reply. I have taken time to read various posts regarding the increase in weight that some ladies face once they are on the hormone therapy. For some ladies there is no weight gain, I wish I was one of them but hey that's not to be. I am not a big eater and quite often don't have an appetite at all. I went onto the Slimming World diet for a time but found that the volume of food was too much for me. However I do still cook with little or no oils or fats which is good. I do take regular exercise too, obviously it's not enough.  Since joining the McMillan site I realise that my issue is so small in comparison to many of the ladies out there who are in constant pain, have to cope with a multitude of drugs, facing chemo, radiotherapy etc etc. It makes me feel so guilty, ungrateful, ungracious, unworthy and even vane. I hope I'm none of those things. It's just when you have always been able to keep a fairly trim figure and suddenly it goes to pot it makes me feel angry I suppose. I hate myself physically but more so emotionally.  I hope you are able to keep well as you continue on your journey too.    Bye for now.    Best wishes.    Chrissi P",

      "Content": "Just found this thread...  I'm (hopefully) having my third FEC on Thursday.  It's now day 20 of the second cycle and I've still got most of my hair thanks to the cold cap.  The pain from the cold only lasts a couple of minutes with each cap replacement (for me) and I've not ended up getting wet from it defrosting (in fact there's no water - it's just a neoprene icepack really so no moisture dripping like some have experienced).  My nurses have said it really does work and is worth perservering with.  Someone at the weekend asked when I was starting treatment and would I lose my hair so it must be working.  My hair started shedding on day 15 of the first treatment and that went on for about 5 or 6 days but this cycle if there are a dozen hairs in my comb in the morning it's a lot.  Just make sure the cap touches your scalp all over - I don't think mine did first time around. I'd say go for it - I had to ask to have the cap as it's not always offered automatically.  The hospital I'm being treated at are very good with their advice and I've met other people who've used the cap and are towards the end of their treatment and had very little hair loss.  I guess it doesn't work for everyone but is worth trying.  For me it means I've not had to tell my dad I'm having treatment as I still look 'normal' - he'd worry himself silly as he's of the opinion that cancer means an early grave and wouldn't believe that my consultant says the cancer's gone and this is preventative treatment to stop anything that's lurking turning nasty in the future. Good luck.",

As for veins etc.  No one suggested anything other than finding a vein each time for me and I've been fine.  No problems so far.",

A friend who went through all this a few years ago (before we met) describes herself as a cancer survivor in a very special club where she gets private quality medical care on the NHS for the rest of her life (she refused to ever be a cancer patient or a cancer sufferer) and I'm hoping I can deal with it as well as she has.

      "Content": "'Morning all, it's day 11 after first chemo for me and I've decided to take notice of the nurses and keep away from people for a couple of days so am working from home at least until Wednesday (I'll be climbing the walls by then!).  I'm still feeling pretty good although a bit tired today - probably did too much over the weekend and got woken up a few times last night (my dogs need slippers to muffle their claws on the wooden floor boards - why do they feel the need to creep around at 2am then again at 4am when I'm really tired???). Hat, my GP also suggested that forums tend to be frequented mainly by those who have problems and that most people sail through the treatment with no problems.  Her view was that forums are useful for support because you're all going through the same thing so long as you keep in mind that the vast majority of people don't use them and don't have any problems. Josie,  I'm just having 6 rounds of FEC followed by radiation and tamoxifen (hopefully that means I'll at least keep my nails).  My mouth felt like I'd just recovered from a bad cold last week - bit furry and taste not quite right, this morning I've got a slightly metallic taste but the furriness has improved a lot.  All my hair's still in place at the moment.  Hopefully the cold cap will prevent me losing much but at least the weather's warming up.  I got my wig last Thursday - my hair's fairly fine and the wig has more hair than I've ever had.  It looks ok but 'too perfectly styled' for me so hopefully I'm not going to need it (wonder if there's a good market on ebay for second hand wigs when this is all over???). My scars are only a month old and are still a bit tender and lumpy - more so when I'm tired or when I've done more than I should (I was working in the garden for a few hours yesterday and certainly know about it this morning - well, since the operation a month ago I suppose I've taken things easier than usual and it's hit my fitness levels).  I've started massaging lightly with bio oil and it does seem to help.  My arm was very sore when the nerves started healing but is much better now.  Luckily I only needed a small lump and a couple of lymph nodes removed and the lump was in from my breast bone so there was very little damage to muscles and I had full movement in my arm all the way through.  Hope we're all going to have a good week.  For me it's important to know that people are doing ok as well as helping to support those that are feeling under the weather. Good luck, another week nearer the end of treatment! Chrissi xxx",

I think the medical profession have a good point - the way my GP put it, explaining that most people are doing ok and to remember that those that have problems are a very unfortunate minority, is the right way to describe the forums.  Yes, the forums are very useful, but we have to remember that just because one person is experiencing a certain side-effect it doesn't mean we all will and not to expect to experience that problem - that's the point my GP was making.  She wanted to tell me to remain positive and expect to sail through the treatment in the hope that it would help me to treat problems as minor set-backs and keep a positive attitude towards my treatment (which in turn would help me to deal with any problems that hit me). I have to admit the first time I looked at the breast cancer forum I thought 'oh my god!  How am I going to cope with all those problems people are describing' That was the day before my first chemo session and I scared myself silly by reading how ill some people had felt - my main worry was that people have been off work for months during treatment - if I miss more than a month of work in the year I'm going to be on statutory sick pay and my savings will be disappearing rapidly.  At that point I had almost decided not to come back here but I went to my GPs surgery the day after chemo for my swine flu injection and the nurse said to try the forums again and to post when I felt good as well as when I felt bad because there would be plenty of others who wanted to know that it's not all bad and that you can feel good. So, today I feel good!  I'm bored with being at home avoiding contact with people because of where I am in my chemo cycle, but compared with what I expected for my first cycle I'm doing fine.    Chrissi",

I'm now on day 7 after chemo and my op was exactly a month ago today so it sounds as though my treatment's been progressed quite a bit faster than some of you (I was told I'd recovered well from the op but as it apparently only took half an hour to do it was very minor - counting my blessings!).  This morning I walked the dogs with my husband at 6am - my first morning out since chemo.  I'd expected to feel exhausted after half a mile but managed our usual route of a a couple of miles in half an hour.  I'm actually feeling fairly normal - got some 'dry' patches in my mouth and still feel as though I've had one too many late nights but the indigestion's virtually gone now.  My hair's still holding in but my scalp feels a bit prickly (like I can feel the hair growing) so not sure if the cold cap's worked or not at the moment.  Strangely my eye lashes seem to have grown over the last week and look thicker than usual (usually very straggly) so I'm wondering if they've put on a last ditch burst of energy before they depart (body hair's still growing - my husband says he's looking forward to me not pinching his razor though). I was told that chemo would probably stop my periods, at least temporarily.  For the first time in many years (I've been peri-menopausal since before I hit 40, now 45) my period's turned up precisely one month after the last one and with no PMT (over the last few years I've gone months with nothing apart from the PMT bit).   The advantage of getting to this stage earlier than most is that the mammogram clearly showed my lump.  The human body is definitely bizarre in the way it reacts to outside influences. I spoke to oncology yesterday and they're fairly confident they'll stop the heartburn and indigestion next time and also that if I'm sensible with eating and light exercise I should be able to avoid weight gain so am feeling more confident about the next few months.  Just waiting to hear back about a wig now.  I went to be measured last week and of course they had nothing in stock that would suit me so said they'd get a couple of possible styles in this week - the idea of having hair that doesn't develop a mind of it's own and only looks good on the day I've visited the hairdresser is actually quite appealing! I'm working in the office today but think I might work from home the rest of the week just to avoid bugs etc as much as possible until my system starts to recover a bit. Hope everyone's doing ok today, Luv, Chrissi xxx",

      "Content": "Hi, I had my first FEC last thursday with cold cap (following lumpectomy and sentinal lymph node removal about 3 1/2 weeks ago - lymph nodes were fine and plenty of healthy tissue around the lump).  No sickness (felt fine Thursday and Friday) but have had horrible indigestion since but is getting better since I finished the two days of steroids on Saturday.   I spoke to the local oncology ward on Saturday but they didn't seem that interested in me feeling grotty and just suggested gaviscon as they believed the steroids didn't agree with me.  Had plenty of energy over the weekend but I'm feeling pretty tired today and blurred but am at work and vertical.  My skin's gone a bit dry - hands look about 20 years older than last week but hopefully plenty of handcream will keep that under control.  I'm keeping telling myself that it's 1 down, 5 treatments to go...  Has anyone else suffered from indigestion?  Any suggestions for how to get it under control please? Many thanks, Chrissi",

      "Content": "Connor, I was diagnosed early feb (felt a lump, lump didn't show as a problem on scans but another one - 1.5cm - showed up that wasn't felt by me or the consultant so am considering myself incredibly lucky), operation on the 17th and first chemo 11th March.  So far I've missed just one day of work (the day of the op although if I'd known I'd have been sitting waiting until 4pm I'd have taken something to do in with me!).  I'm having 6 rounds of FEC (followed by radiation and tamoxifen) and was expecting last Thursday to be horrible.  For me it was ok.  The hospital's fairly small but has an excellent reputation as a breast clinic and the day ward where the chemo's done is really bright and friendly (arm chairs, not beds and radio playing).  I've had no nausea but did have bad indigestion on Saturday and it's still not 100% gone now but isn't causing me any problems (actually worse before I eat than after so I'm probably eating more than usual) and Sunday and Monday felt like I'd had one late night too many but was still functioning ok and a couple of early nights seem to have sorted that out. I'm working at home today as it's day 9 and my immune system's probably not too keen on meeting any challenges but I'll be back in the office on Monday. My attitude is that so long as I treat this as a minor glitch then that's all it's going to be and that by the autumn this will be over and done with and I can get on with my life again.  I'm making the most of every day I feel good and looking after myself (my nurse recommended full fat milk and nothing diet or low fat but perhaps smaller portions than usual if I find I'm not so active) and on the days when I feel a bit down I remind myself that it will pass.  So far it's working - in a few weeks time I may feel very differently but I think the drugs seem to affect everyone very differently.  I'd be interested to know if anyone else is working through their treatment and how active you're all managing to keep.  Best of luck to everyone, Chrissi xxx",

      "Content": "Kat, no, not OCD.  I'm still finding my way with this.  The warnings about virtually no immune system between days 10 and 14 are scary - I can't remember the last time I had as much as a cold but when I do they usually hit hard.  My hands have never been washed so frequently as the last few days and when I did go out at the weekend I kept as far away from people as possible in the supermarket (I turned up at opening time Saturday morning) and was tempted to put a scarf around my face...  I'm sure I'll get the hang of this but a bit paranoid at the moment - don't want to risk having to postpone any treatments as I want to get this over and done with asap!   So for now it's lots of handwashing, anti-bacterial gel etc...

      "Content": "Forion, I know what you mean about walking down the street naked painted green - if a doctor told me that was the only way to avoid side-effects I'd be straight out there!  Reading the posts from people not having a great time does make me realise how lucky I am - I'm sitting here thinking \"well at least my hair's still here and it's day 15\" or \"well, I wasn't sick\".  I'm sure there were many people who read that I'd had horrible indigestion who were feeling relieved it hadn't happened to them. You've got to laugh... Oh well, this time next week I'll have had the second dose - that's a whole third of my treatment!.  The hospital says I can have a free pamper day at the local hospice if I want - think I'll ask for it to be booked after my third session as I'll be half way then so can have a little celebration.

      "Content": "I put on weight after my lumpectomy (before chemo) simply because I wasn't as active as usual and was still eating the same amount - I took the advice of the Macmillan nurse who said to avoid anythng low fat and really wish I had carried on as normal.  Since starting chemo I've put on another half stone.  I'm told putting on up to 10% of your body weight is normal during chemo - partly because you're probably less active than usual but mainly due to the way your body reacts to the steroids you get with your drugs.   My first two FEC doses saw me eating for England!  I literally found it almost impossible to stop eating - I was so hungry!  This time (third FEC) the consultant halved the steroids and ok, I'm more tired, but my appetite is back to what I'd consider normal again.",

      "Content": "Good morning all, I was supposed to be working at the office today but got there to find that one of my colleagues has a sore throat and swollen glands - I'd asked for everyone to phone me first thing if they were going in with bugs but instead of phoning she'd emailed my work email address over the weekend.  I was not happy - just had to turn around and come home again as I didn't want to risk catching the bug.  Hopefully she kept far enough away from me in the short time I was there.  I was really looking forward to getting out of my isolation today (another colleague had germs last week). Apart from that and a slight touch of hayfever I'm feeling ok.  I noticed at the weekend that my physical strength is down on what it should be but I suppose having taken things easy for a month due to the op that's not surprising. Despite the cold cap my hair (just on my head) seems to be shedding more than usual - my comb's had no hairs at all in it from my first session until yesterday so I'm not sure whether it's just normal hair loss delayed a bit or whether it's on the way out.  Maybe I'll have a surf on ebay for headscarves later. If all goes well with my blood tests on Wednesday I'll have the second chemo on Thursday afternoon.   I've stocked up on gaviscon, mints and ginger - will be prepared this time. Good luck to everyone having a chemo session this week and if it's your first, just try to relax - it will soon be over and you'll have a good excuse to put your feet up and be spoilt over the bank holiday. Together we can get through this! Chrissi x",
