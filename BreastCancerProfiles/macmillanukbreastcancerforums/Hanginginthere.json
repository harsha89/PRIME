    "Content": "Hi, I see that you post was two years ago. I hope you still check in to see if anyone has replied. My tumor in my left breast was 8cms. I too am worried because from everything I have been reading on the internet, they don't talk about that size, it is usually 6 cms or much less. I had to have a mastectomy and radiation treatment. I too had isolated cells in my lymph nodes and my grade was grade 3, stage 4. I am still around but my surgery was only last November 2017. I still deal with weakness in legs, fatigue, soreness and pain under my right arm and where my breast was removed. I worry too about the size of the tumor. You are not alone, I pray that things are going well for you. I pray that my cancer won't return. Trying to stay positive. For anyone who hasn't been thru this, it is not easy, but you have to stay positive and keep the faith. I never in a million years thought it would be so difficult.",
