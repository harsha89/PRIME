      "Content": "Hi everyone,  I told you I'd keep you updated. Unfortunately I have breast cancer. Oestrogen receptive and been told it's been caught early enough at the moment to only need surgery and radiotherapy. Still waiting for the results of the HER2 test which may change the outlook to needing chemo but fingers crossed it won't come to that. Really hope you're all well. Thinking positively and outlook at the moment looks ok.  Louise x",

      "Content": "Hi there-  I am sorry to hear about your diagnosis- but please be assured that you will come through the other side of this. It\u2019s been a year since my diagnosis now and Lots has changed but I still feel strong.  I was diagnosed eventually with triple positive Er+ pr+ and Her2+. However it was predominantly Er+ with more than 90% of tumour receptors being er+. Therefore I followed the treatment plan specifically to target oestrogen. So- I did not have chemo despite the Her2 but that was a very personal choice. I did not have fertility treatment... oncologists told me that there is no reason to suggest that tamoxifen would affect my fertility long term. They said the only thing that may affect fertility at my age was chemo, but I chose not to have it. I started tamoxifen last July and had radiotherapy in August. I do have a strong family history of Bc but all of my genes tests were negative (and I had extensive testing). I continued to have periods even though taking the tamoxifen. Only side effect was pelvic pain for which I recently went for an ultrasound. My womb lining has become extremely thick so have been asked to stop tamoxifen temporarily just whilst they help that. Had hysteroscopy and D&C last week to clear things a bit so waiting now to hear if I should start tamoxifen again.  If it are worried about fertility they will send you to a clinic. Just ensure you know all of the side effects if you have your eggs frozen though as it affects women with PCOS differently.  Please do keep in contact. I\u2019m always here if you need someone.  Louise x",

      "Content": "Hello,  On Wednesday 18th January, I went to have an ultrasound, mammogram and biopsy at the hospital after finding a strange lumpy area in my right breast. On initial consultation with my GP, he reassured me that it was probably nothing to worry about as I am only 25, and more often than not, any findings are usually down to fluctuating hormones throughout a regular menstrual cycle. Unfortunately, cancer is not uncommon in my family. My maternal grandmother had breast cancer in her 60s, my Aunty has had ovarian cancer, my mum has had endometrial cancer and I myself at the age of 18 had what was described as abnormal precancerous cells growing in an large ovarian cyst that was removed via laparoscopy. I have polycystic ovaries which made me more susceptible to abnormal changes in the ovaries. Anyway, fast forward 7 years and here I am worrying myself sick that I have breast cancer. The ladies at the hospital were wonderful, but they showed me my mammogram images and there is a clear cluster (calcification) in the right breast (they explained this to me) they said that this is a cause for concern which is why the biopsy was done. I have to wait until next Wednesday 25th January to find out. My husband is going to come with me. Already I have prepared myself for bad news. I am just wondering if anyone could shed some light on my situation- has anyone had anything similar? What happened? thanks in advance. ",

      "Content": "Hi everyone-  Thank you for your words of reassurance and experience at this time. I am so grateful that so many of you have taken the time to reply- it's really comforting. You've all hit the nail on the head with regards to feeling like your life is on hold until you know for definite. Like Sal said,I genuinely got the impression that the nurses are worried which in turn has made me prepare for the worst- any other news would be a bonus. I think a worry at this age is that if I have to have treatment I won't be able to have children, which is devastating in itself never mind anything else. I am going to be positive no matter what as there is so much that can be done having some faith won't hurt. I will keep you updated, it does feel great that I can come on here and actually talk about it a bit more. Sometimes it's hard to talk to family members no matter how close we are and how supportive they are. I am a school teacher and I have genuinely struggled to get this off my mind whilst teaching today. Luckily it is my planning and prep time this pm so not had a full day. My headteacher is so supportive which has really helped the situation here. Thanks everyone- so appreciate your support.  Louise ",
