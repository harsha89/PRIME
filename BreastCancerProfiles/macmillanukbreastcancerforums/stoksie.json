      "Content": "Hi This thread was here mid August when I was waiting for the post op mtg. and I have re-read a few times as v.helpful. I was told I would have rads plus drugs for 5 yrs as margins and nodes clear. Was relieved at the time and had treatment plan. I asked the consultant - do I need chemo and he said no. The only prob I have had is infection from lumpectomy plus chronic acid reflux.. Had appt  (Mon) with onc re rads (she was on holiday when they met to discuss the treatment plan post op) but she said my tumor was grade 2 and she wanted me to consider chemo. I am 56. She said it would improve outcome by 3.5% over the next 10 yrs. To be honest I found it hard to take it all in as itwas unexpected but agreed to chemo as realised I was emotional and thought I should try to think practically. I have been upset and anxious since. She initially came in calling me by the wrong name and had the wrong notes and when finished she didn't say good bye but left the room - I heard her say to the nurse in the corridor - tell her she can go home. I have cried a few times since finding out re the BC and this was one of them.  I am trying to separate how I felt from the need to make a good decision. She was OK overall and it was a busy clinic but she was a bit brusque.  I said the consultant surgeon had said chemo not needed but she said he is only a surgeon. I understand she is the onc and therefore an expert. Had to see BCN today to check the lump wound and the consultant surgeon was there - he said it is my choice and I should have another discussion with the onc. before I decide. I think he believes it is not needed.  They will monitor me over the next few years. Surely they are part of the same team? I now have to see onc Fri and  need to ask her some questions. Any suggestions welcome. Now more confused than ever... Thanks Elaine x      ",

Just finished chemo 5 so that may be affecting healing. The surgeon seems pleased with it after looking and feeling it and thinks it will settle down. I have just ordered some rosehip oil. I havn't put much on it as it felt tender up to recently and thought it best to leave well alone. I am due to start radiotherapy in Feb so will be moisturising as recommended. Have you asked the nurse, oncologist or surgeon to look at it? In meantime you could try ringing the helpline here or breast cancer care or your breast care nurse? I have found the anxiety almost as bad and at times worse than anything so don't suffer in silence. Hope you can get some re-assurance soon x",

      "Content": "Hi Caryn I didn't have full node clearance (just few taken) but I leaked for a few weeks. I didn't have a drain as only had lumpectomy (was like a quadrectomy) and the wound is/was a bout 3-4 inches. The BCN  wasn't worried and squeezed it to get liquid out - that meant having a towel to catch it.. She encouraged me to squeeze it out as well especially in the shower. She said 'Better out than in'. I dried it carefully and put sterile dressings on but had to keep changing - found that large non sticky ones kept in place with sleep bra worked. BCN may give you some or you can buy them in Superdrug etc. The glue on the sticky ones ripped my skin. I did end up having antibiotics which helped me and the last leak I had after taking them was a bit gooey (sorry if you are eating your tea!) but that was because |I had had an infection which is not the case with you. It did get me down at the time and I felt a bit insecure going out.  It has dried up now but it did take 3-4 weeks for me. Yours may take much less so don't despair it will stop eventually. If you are worried ring and go in to get it checked out regularly. It can be worrying dealing with it on your own so reassurance does help. This really hepled me - the BCN being really accessible.  Not sure if any of this helps - please ask more if you need to   Elaine x",

I was so 'rabbit in the headlights' when the consutant went through everything that was one question I didn't ask. I am going to go with the flow and take some time - not easy for me.  I haven't made my mind up re work - I have a note to end of 1st week Sept . Still sore from the op and wound healing,  very tired and wondering re the emotional side of getting back.

I have never felt so vulnerable.  I was trying to get my life together just before  BC and had seen a solicitor to see about divorce. Now I have less energy and as before I have 3 children to consider (15,18 and 24) middle one just gone to university and eldest lives away. I am more than ever convincd I need to move on from my husband (it's a long story) but timing has been a real issue for me and I haven't worked this one out 100% yet. Husband has never been very kind to me and has a tendency to try to be controlling. I thought he might be better in all humanity to help me but he is strugging becuase his default position is to feel sorry for himself.  I have supported him financially for the last 15 years through a failed business and re-training twice. I am trying to conserve energy to get through this and hopefully heal and get better and have a happer future. Harder to see some days than ever.  So don;t worry about sharing and being boring Sascha. I am glad you can share and discuss and thank all those who do this.  We are all on a hard road no matter what is going on in the bigger picture of our lives.  Big hugs to all . Good night all x",

I wonder whether it might be useful to speak to one of the helpline people here or on  breast cancer care or confide in your BCN if you feel comfortable with this. I have chemo next week and chemo brain allowing will ask re chemo and breast pain. I hope this is what it is.  What we realy want is to be told everything is OK and I hope your results are good. What has helped me is foot relfexology as a treat (this really helps me to relax though I know not everyone can do this or likes having their feet being touched). I have also seen there are relaxation classes near me which I am thinking may help me. However I do know some days I dont want to leave the house. Hang on in there  Lots of love Elaine xxx ",

      "Content": "Hi Lynne I finished chemo nearly 4 weeks ago and can remember feeling very nervous before the first one. As most ladies say - take the anti sickness meds. I felt less nauseous with each treatment but tiredness can  accumulate so rest when you need to. By week 2-3 after each chemo you may find you begin to feel OK again so feel more able to catch up on things you want to do before the next session. My advice would be to be kind to yourself and take it easy. Try not to worry about doing everything you are used to doing, It is time to really look after yourself.  I had some different symptoms with the first eg spots on my face. I had some mouth/nose soreness and from the 5th cycle my abdomen has been painful. Having said that as most say - it is doable though I admit that at number 3 I felt like not doing any more! There are many threads on here and on breastcancercare re. chemo and the symptoms can vary from person to person and session to session. Most symotoms have been experienced by someone and it can be re-assuring to check it out.. I did the cold cap - which was OK for the first 2 sessions as my hair was still thickish and insulated my scalp from the cap. I did keep most of my hair but it thinned quite a lot on top and did come out in clumps after number 2. As it was winter I was able to wear a wooly hat when I went out and it looked fine so I never needed the wig. The cap felt colder with each session but I perservered though was tempted to give up. They gave me hot drinks which helped as did the heated pillow they used for the arm in which  they injected the chemo. It didn't add 3-4 hours - I would say about 1.5-2 hours max. in my case. Good luck with what ever you decide. Elaine x",

I also had an infection after my op but it was before rads. The surgeon didn't want to give antibiotics but the bcn had a swab tested (I had quite a bit of seroma after the op) and it showed infection. This was after a few weeks of complaining and hoping it would clear up. The infection delayed the healing but did get better after antibiotics. It can take a while for everything to settle down after the op. Because I had chemo it was a while before rads but I may have had swelling and redness if I had not had chemo and had rads sooner (?)   Hard to know. I was told the effects of rads carries on after the treatment so it could be hot and red for a while and coupled with the infection it may have dragged on for you?. Has it showed any signs of getting better yet? All he best x",

Chris - thanks for your reply - I think the scan you mentioned is a Dexa bone scan which looks at bone density but I don't think it detects secondaries?

The anxiety has got to be unhealthy so anything that could be done to speed it up is humane. I came across a report from the Cancer Campaign group which showed research into how integrated care for cancer patients is. They had about 19 demands and the second one (after speedy referrals for diagnosis) was the need for patients to have quicker test results. If you goggle Cancer Campaigning Group - Cancer patients experience of integrated care the report should come up as a pdf. It is supported by various groups eg Macmillan there may be a link on this site? Will have a search to see if it is here. So, this is a perennial issue and one which I am dealing with at the moment. How do we get professionals to incorporate research results into practice? From what you say it is a staffing/financial issue? Is it that training places have been cut? I'm not sure but it will certainly be a consideration for me at the ballot box. Good luck at your meeting.",

Surgeon said he would advise mx if it was his wife as he can do reconstruction at later date but breast care nurse cautioned against mx as lump removal less radical and will conserve nipple even though top outside quarter of breast will be removed. She said reconstruction is 10 hr op. So confused as to which option. I am more concerned re survival at this stage - both nurse and doctor said survival rates similar for both procedures.

Don't worry about your onc thinking you are a hypochondriac. I think many of us are more vigilant now. He or she may be the same if they had had the diagnosis of cancer! They may not be thinking this anyway and even if they are thinking this they should still  listen to you re any symptoms you are having. This is their job. So please let the medics know your symptoms - better than worrying on your own. Glad you only have until Thurs to do this. Hopefully the pain will pass and you can feel less anxiety. I still worry eg I have hip pain and think I will have ups and downs emotionally from now on. With every milestone (now 2 yrs post diagnosis) I am hoping this will fade a little.

I have been on Letrozole for nearly 2 yrs. joint pain is the worst. I also have itchy eyes and dryness. I am lucky to have acupuncture via NHS clinic. This does help with joints but I am trying to live with it all. I just hope it is 5 years and not 10. Guess I will cross that bridge when it comes.  X",

I am also taking meds for osteoporosis. My onc referred me for acupuncture aand this does help alongside paracetemol. I have good days and bad days.  I do get pangs of anxiety. I am gritting my teeth for the next 3 years but the pain does bring worry. It does make it harder to move forward. Glad your scans were clear. What scans did you have?My GP sent me for x-ray - in case there was a fracture but no scans. Can I ask if you get itchy eyes? I am not sure if this is due to drugs or something else. Hard to separate it all ! All the best x",

On top of this he is does not appear confident in his own ability so I would ge a second opinion as he suggests. My surgeon is a plastic surgeon - could this be an option for you to find one under the health service in Spain? If I  had had a mx I was told I would have had to have waited a year after rads. Hopefully others here can give you the benefit of their experience. A year is a long time when you feel as you do but I would try for a another opinion to see if it was more optinistic and confident. x  ",
