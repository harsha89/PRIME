      "Content": "Hi all I had an appointment with my oncologist today and have been told I need to have zoledronic acid drip every 6 months. I\u2019ve been told all the sides effects and I\u2019m a little worried as the Dr said my teeth could fall out ! And my bones could fracture. Has anyone else been told this? Or is anyone on zoledronic acid?  Help  Thanks  Lisa  X ",
