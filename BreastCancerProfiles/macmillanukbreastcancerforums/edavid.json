      "Content": "Hi all, I had a mastectomy and axillary node clearance last Wednesday (7th) and thankfully all went really well. I have still got my surgical drain in,  but hope to have that removed later today at my nurse led follow up appointment. Generally I have felt a little brighter, taken less pain relief, and been a tiny bit more active each day. There is one side effect that I wasn't expecting though - my stomach is really bloated. It's a small thing I know, and I should be really grateful if this is my only worry! However having spent the last 7-8 months getting my weight under control (have lost a little under 2 stone) I guess I am sensitive to this issue as I don't want to go back to being so overweight having worked hard.  I'm throwing the question out there wondering if others have experienced the same and if so how long it has continued for? Thank you all! L",

      "Content": "Rather than post a plea for help, today I want to share the link to a truly inspirational film, that shows the phenomenal achievement of Nicky Spinks a BC survivor.  Born in London, Nicky moved to the Peak District while still a child. She is now a farmer in Yorkshire. She had always been an active person, and was initially introduced to running by her granddad and became a keen long distance runner.  She was diagnosed with BC in 2006, and had a mastectomy of the right breast.  On her own website she says about BC \"I can never be the person I was however I'm not sure I would want to be. Cancer has made me realize what is important in life and to appreciate what I have a lot more.\"  (www.runbg.co.uk/breast cancer.htm) On 15 May 2016, Nicky completed a double Bob Graham Round in 45 hours 30 minutes, beating the previous record set by Roger Baumeister in 1979 by more than an hour. This film is the story of that amazing achievement - interlaced with snippets about her life and cancer.   (The Bob Graham Round is a fell running challenge in the English Lake District. It is named after Bob Graham (1889\u20131966), a Keswick guest-house owner, who in June 1932 broke the Lakeland Fell record by traversing 42 fells within a 24-hour period. Nicky did this twice running an incredible 132 miles in under 48 hours!) Amazing views of the Lake District, and an inspirational lady - what's not to love. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!  www.youtube.com/watch xx",

I knew there was a reason I wanted to work here. Nothing but support, taking things one day at a time, will ensure cover provided whenever I need to be at hospital. Will tell colleagues only when I want them to know. Big hug and offer of safe haven if I ever need to get away from work environment. What a superstar! I know there will be tricky times ahead, but I know I have support. Faith in humankind. ",
