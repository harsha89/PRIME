      "Content": "Hi Moleend I'm sorry to hear you are having to go through all this for a second time. The decision you are facing is not an easy one. My cancer was grade 2, I had a lumpectomy with a 5mm clear margin. During surgery 2 nodes were removed and tested, they both contained cancer cells so they removed the lot (test rsults showed that the others did not contain cancer cells). My oncologist informed me that I was borderline for chemo and that there was a 2.68% possibility that the cancer would return. I really didn't know what to do and she said perhaps I should view chemo as an insurance policy. After giving it a great deal of thought I made the decision to go ahead based on the fact that if it did come back I would be forever saying to myself  'WHAT IF'. I don't know if it will come back despite the chemo but at least I know I gave it my best shot. It really isn't an easy decision but I hope my story has been of some use to you. Good luck. Lisa x",

      "Content": "Hi Maggs I'm so sorry to hear that your cancer came back, lets hope they have well and truly got rid of it this time. The trouble with this thing is you never really know if it will come back or not, I'm at the stage where I think every ache and pain might be cancer. I try not to think like that but sometimes I just can't help myself. Does that feeling ever really go away? You're right this is a great site, I wish I had made use of it earlier. The people are so supportive. I hope you've had a good day today. x",

      "Content": "Hi All I had grade 2. I had lumpectomy, they found cancer in two nodes during surgery so they removed them all. I had a drain in for 24 hours after leaving hospital. Breast care nurse told me that fluid could build up and feel like a grapefruit under the arm she said if that happens I should go in to see her and she would drain it, fortunately it didin't happen. I also had cording, which went away on it's own after a few weeks. The breast care nurse told me that she could pop the cord but she doesn't like doing it because it's very painful.  I have a friend who has very severe cording, which is affecting her mobility. She is going to have the cord cut when she has her reconstruction. I had 6 sessions of chemo and 19 sessions of radio, which finished in the summer. I'm now on letrozole for 5 years. I am suffering some side effects including constant headache, neck pain, musculoskeletal pain, mild depression and outbursts of anger but hey it could be much worse. Good luck to all of you with all your treatments and if you have any problems however minor, give your breast care nurse a call, she really won't mind. Best wishes Lisa x",

Your activity will appear below biography (centre of screen) and you click on the topic you want to contribute to and then click on reply at the top of the message you want to respond to. There is a flag at top right hand side of the forum that will say email (or don't email) me replies, click on this to change it from one to the other. Please be patient, not everyone that logs on will have been experiencing what you are so may feel that they are not in a position to offer advice. Also there are many forums on this site and maybe the breast cancer forum wasn't  particularly busy yesterday afternoon. Many members on this site are ill and undergoing treatment so they are not always up to logging on. Please be patient, I'm sure you will get some more responses soon, I know it can be frustrating but it's well worth the wait, as there are very supportive people here. I finished my treatment for breast cancer earlier in the year. My personal opinion is that life goes on and I would not expect people to put thier lives on hold during treatment. Treatment can go on for a long time so it wouldn't be practical anyway, also sometimes treatment can be quite rough and I for one didn't want to be surrounded by people all the time especially as I spent a lot of time sleeping. Sufferers quite often need practical help like lifts to and from hospital, help with shopping and housework and maybe a shoulder to cry on occasionally. Perhaps the best thing is to work out some sort of family rota with regard to practical help but the shoulder to cry on can't really be planned. I hope this is of some help. If you have any questions please feel free to ask. Best wishes Lisa",

      "Content": "Hi Jazz I started my radio 3 weeks after chemo finished. Had 6 chemo at 3 week intervals thsan radio every working day for 19 days.   Hi Clarets12 Was rough for about five days after chemo (although was always ok following day). Had a bad reaction to taxotere and chemo was changed. Chemo isn't nice but it is doable. Side effects and reactions vary from person to person. I found that radio was a doddle in comparison to chemo. Please feel free to ask questions. You can send a private message if you like. Don't be scared, once you have got the first one out of the way you'll have a much better understanding of it all. The chemo nurses are excellent. Take care Lisa x  ",

I thought I had a pretty high pain threshold but discovered I am a bit of a wimp. Ha,ha. Good luck with your treament. You sound as though you're coping. Lisa x",

I have had CT scan which was clear, I have had an X-ray which showed wear and tear but nothing sinister and I am having an MRI on Monday. My oncologist says he doesn't think my constant headache relates to chemo but I'm not convinced. If anyone has similar probs I would be glad to hear from you. Thanks Lisa x",

      "Content": "Hi Sarah   I'm affraid I only had one Docetaxel. I had a severe reaction to it. The bone pain was unbearable for me. I felt as though I had been beaten up with a baseball bat, I was given co-codemol which helped a bit but not much. My chemo was delayed for a week and changed.   I'm not trying to scare you as we all react differently to differnet things, you will find people here who had no problem with it. But just incase ask your hospital to provide some very strong pain relief.   I think there are a few threads on taxotere/docetaxel so it maybe helpfull if you type into search @ top right hand side of screen and you may get a lot more info.   Good luck & take care.
