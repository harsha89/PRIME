      "Content": "Hi Carole, I used the cold cap through my 6 doses of FEC and it worked really well for me. Yes it is freezing cold, but after the first 20 mins i kinda got used to it and try to find a warm place in the department where you have your treatment, ie not near a window as you will feel very cold. Take a warm jumper with a hoodie with you to put on after wards. I did still find handfulls of hair when i either washed or combed my hair during the treatment but you would not notice now, my hair is just a bit finer. I used baby shampoo and washed my hair as little as possible, ie not even once a week. Good luck carole, do persevere with it if you feel it is right for you, but do make sure you have you wig ordered just in case, and i always carried a bandana in my handbag right through my chemo just in case.",

I am nearing the end of my treatment, (hooray) and am starting to think about a holiday before i go back to work. Can anyone suggest any insurance companies that are kind to BC sufferers, and don't rip us off. Many thanks    ",

      "Content": "Hi Deegismo, Likewise to what has already been said, my oncology nurse sorted out my wig arrangements for me. The system seems to work on the NHS that if you have been an inpatient for at least one night in an NHS hospital then you qualify for a free voucher up to the amount of £120. Which should cover most wigs available. I got this from the appliancses officer at my hospital and she then gave me a list of local wig suppliers to choose from and contact myself. It seems you have to be a bit clever and milk the NHS a bit(well no surprises there) by telling them you have been an inpatient at anytime during your journey. I've just got mine this week and am really pleased with it. Good luck with the \"system\" don't let them beat you Now i'm gonna hijack your post and ask some advice, what does everyone find is the best thing to was their wig in?    ",
