      "Content": "Hi everyone, had my fertility treatment done yesterday...not too bad pain wise at the time but boy am I sore today! On a brighter note myself and my husband have 5 embryos that are now frozen and stored safely for us should we need to use them :) Also had my hair cut yesterday (hate it so much) but will make it bearable for when it falls out. My headgear arrived today (not normally so organised) and I couldn't bear to look at it in the mirror. Not ready just yet...maybe when my husband comes in from work and we eat our tea i'll do it then. Hope everyone is as well as they can be... Brenda x",

      "Content": "Hi everyone, im new to this so hope im in the right discussion. Im 30yrs old and was diagnosed with idc and dcis in my left breast 15th April. I opted for mastectomy with full node clearance which I had done on 19th May. I haven't kids yet so myself and hubby are in middle of fertility treatment which finishes on 17th June. I received a telephone call from Oncologist's secretary today to say im scheduled for my first FEC-T on 24th June. Feel a tad scared about this as im not sure what im expecting...would be grateful for any tips / advice...Thanking you all in advance B x :)",

      "Content": "Thanks everyone who replied to me, I appreciate all your comments. I have booked the hair dresser to get my hair cut short as its quite long...not brave enough to shave it myself so im hoping once its cut a bit shorter that will help. I will make enquiries into the  cold cap when I speak to my oncologist. I have my egg collection/embryo freezing on Wednesday ( something I never thought id have to deal with so early on in my married life - we are just married 1year). I'll be able to concentrate better once I get past that stage. Thanks again Brenda xx",
