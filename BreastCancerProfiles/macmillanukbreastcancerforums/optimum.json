My radiotherapy starts in November and i havent thought about it as it seemed so far away but i've now been told i have my first radiotherapy appointment on Monday 24th July. What questions should i ask? I am HER2+ive. I had a mastectomy on the 10th April. 14 nodes removed, 5 infected, one of which was \"extra capsular extension\" Thanks Deirdre",

      "Content": "Hi all. I read an article on Friday 16th June 2017 in a british newspaper that said the new drug 'KADCYLA ' has been passed for patients with HER2 that has spread. It is administrated in three weekly cycles and contains Herceptin and Emtansine. My understanding is that you must have already had herceptin and (paclitaxel or docetaxel) before it is offered . My question is could this  wonder drug be used to replace the \"taxels\" before secondaries have occurred or is it a question of finance.? I'm due to start my Herceptin paclitaxel on the 1st August. Thanks every one. Deirdre",

The swelling is not in my arm pit it is in the breast area. It looks like a breast is re growing......i wish. It is also blue ish.

I started \"arimidex\" 4 weeks ago so i think this may be making it worse. Herceptin is more important than arimidex so i think i may cut the later out until my injections have finished.

One of my infected lymph nodes is \"extra capsular\" which means it has burst and i cant help thinking it has travelled everywhere or somewhere.

I live in France and they have interesting statistics on  cancer reocurrance and exercise. Its called MET....metobolic equivalent task. There is a 50% less chance of reoccurance if you follow the minimum suggestions.  There is a list of 30 sports. I have chosen walking at 5km per hour, and i get 3 points for each walk. (you get more points if you do 6.5km per hour) The aim is to do 9 points in the week i e 3 x 5 kms walks in an hour per week.

      "Content": "Hi all, our credit card covers holiday cancellations. I finish my radiotherapy at the beginning of January 2018 but i will be on herceptin until July 2018. Does any one know when \"we\" are classed as healthy again....ie not a risk to the insurance company.  Its great to be thinking of possibly going on holiday again! Thank you Deirdre",

      "Content": "Thanks very much Jo but unfortunatly/fortunatly we live in France, so i don't think Boots will cover that. I think i will have to bite the bullet and phone our credit card company. I know that airlines like easy jet offer flight insurance but i don't know if we have to declare existing conditions.Thank you any way Deirdre",
