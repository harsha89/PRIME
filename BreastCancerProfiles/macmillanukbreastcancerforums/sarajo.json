    "Content": "Hello... First time I've posted on here. I'm not sure how I feel today. I was told 3 weeks ago I had breast cancer, since then I've had the lump removed and a sample of lymph nodes removed, I go on Weds to get results to see if it has spread, but i don't know what type of breast cancer I have, whether I need chemo or radiotherapy. It all seems a bit much today and feeling a bit sorry for myself.",
