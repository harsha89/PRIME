      "Content": "Hi All, I have a recurrence to my chest wall. I have had radio and chemo but some mass still remains. I am desperately pursuing a chest wall resection for removal if the mass and affected lymph nodes but I know this is a huge operation but I believe it is my only chance of beating this disease. My children are 13, 10 and 7, I owe it to them to pursue every possible avenue of treatment. After being very positive and determined, I am really feeling down at the moment, a prognosis of even ten years is not long enough with children so young and statistics say only 30% with my sort of case live past that. I can't let this beat me and I am determined to fight but I am having difficulty stopping the tears at the moment. Tx",

      "Content": "Thanks both, I will definitely try this tactic. I seem to have dropped into a real pit of being down. In real terms nothing has changed since a week ago, when I was full of fight and determination. Seeking reassurance by researching on the net has brought me fear and upset. I am obsessively feeling where the mass is to see if it is growing now I am off chemo and on Letrozole. I am praying constantly and being Ã¼ber-aware of every slight twinge, cough, headache, in case that is evidence of it spreading. I have three wonderful children who are 13, 10 and 7. I must fight this for them and I must win. No option.",
