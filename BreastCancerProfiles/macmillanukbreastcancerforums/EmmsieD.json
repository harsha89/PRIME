      "Content": "I had a mammogram, ultra sound and biopsy today. The radiologist said she didn't know what it was so she will take some biopsies. I saw black circles on the ultra sound scanner screen and she took prints of them. I went to see the doctor after and he told me I need to come back in a week for results. In your experience, do doctors play down the possibility of any lumps being malignant or are they generally up front if they think it's more sinister? Thank you",

      "Content": "Thanks for so many replies. Sounds like most docs are up front, good to hear. I have to say the radiologist was joking about my lump looking like a snow man, pointing out his head and body, surely they wouldn't make a joke if they thought it was cancer. I will make sure I take my husband with me for my results next Wednesday . I will let you all know. Until then I will remain positive. Xxx",
