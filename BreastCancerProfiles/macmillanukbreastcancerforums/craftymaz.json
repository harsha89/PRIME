      "Content": "I so agree with you Rebecca.  I too went through (I think it was Kate or Dorothy who said it) the slash poison and burn, i was on autopilot, just went to hospital, had treatment came home.  i was luckier than a lot, my hospital is only 3 miles away, parking was free and always available,  It wasn't pleasant but doable and not as bad as imagined it to be, i continued to work two weeks out of every three of the 8 cycles of chemo and all through radiotherapy.  I wasn't a superstar, it was just something that I needed to do, and i am glad I did, but i was left with awful fatigue, but i have a sedentary job and they were brilliant (I should think so too - doctors!! lol) - had a few tears throughout  - mainly missing my daughter's graduation.  But i had a total meltdown last week after reading my diary, as like you, i was caught up in treatments and attention and really it is only now when i am feeling good that it hit me.  But hand on heart, the lovely ladies and gents on this site were amazing and answering my questions.   i was diagnosed at the beginning of August 2012, finished the final radiotherapy in July 2013 and my hair and nails are good now, hair thicker, nails stronger, and my eczema has disappeared (chemo must kill off everything.  ha ha.)  Hubbie and daughters were brilliant too.  So was my grandson who used to come in and kiss the top of my head and he said i kiss your head so your hair will grow back quickly.  i am truly blessed.  I wish everything good to everyone who is or who has gone through this.  speedy recovery.  xxx",

      "Content": "Hi, my last chemo was on 2 March, 23 sessions of radiotherapy, and on the very last day of rads, i stopped wearing my scarf.  My hair by then was about one inch.  I got a dye from Boots as it came through dark with a lot of grey which was to be expected because of my age.  so the dye wasnt the colour i wanted to be but far better than grey.  It came through very fine and wispy to start with and it stood up on end, which reminded me of that character in the Beano (can anyone remember the Beano?).  anyway, i never had it cut or shaved off  and it started to get thicker and it is very slowly growing, it is thicker than my original hair, and feels lovely and soft.  Great news: i used the hairdryer today!!!  Originally I perservered with the cold cap twice but a couple of days after the second chemo/cold cap, my hair was coming out a lot, so i sat and cut it all off and then shaved the rest off, and started wearing scarves.  i do have two wigs but after trying them on in the house, i just didn't feel comfortable, so worse scarves and beanies.  I went to work two weeks out of every three for most of the time, and i was glad i did.  I had ECFM seven sessions, supposed to be eight, but i didn't have to have the last one.  With the radiotherapy i continued to work (the hospital was a three minute drive from work and scheduled for after my working day) but i tihnk i should have taken some time off as now i totally cream crackered with fatigue.  i can't walk far without stiffening up but it is gradually getting better (finished rads on 22 May) and i have booked this week off as annual leave to relax and try and get back into some sort of a routine - going on the treadmill, walking to the shop instead of driving the quarter of a mile - that sort of thing.  So it does get better.  Going back to the hair, one mornign you will just wake up and say \"hey this isn't bad at all\".  i have heard too that shaving off the first growth is supposed to make it stronger when it comes through again, but as AromaMum says, I couldn't bear to be bare headed again, even just for a few weeks.  Good luck to you.  M.   P.S. I am off to buy another hair dye tomorrow as my grey is starting to come through again!  lol.  ",

      "Content": "hi Katharine.  You are doing well too.  And keeping your sense of humour.  don't forget to keep doing your exercises.  they really do help for the radiotherapy as you have to keep your arms above your head, but it is okay, relaxing, as there are arm rests.  but you get an incredible urge to bring your hands down to scratch your nose and it takes all your willpower not to move.  lol.  I know what you mean about all the treatment and worried about hair.  but do you know, i think it was the one worst aspect.  i could cope with the - what is it that dorotheee or Kate said - the slice, poison and burn - or something like that, but it was the hair that upset me the most.  i can't believe how quickly the treatment seems to have come and gone.  in august i never thought i would get to this stage, but here i am and on reflection the time has gone so very quickly.  don't worry about radiotherapy, after chemo, it's a breeze.  i even got burnt and was sore a bit, but didn't overly bother me. there are plenty of creams and dressing they can give you.  even when i blistered and they burst, it wasnt long before they healed.  i had 23 sessions.  scars are fading, no scarring from being burnt, hair growing good, so all is going well, thank God.  big hugs to you.  let me know how get on.  Maz. x",

      "Content": "Hi Katharine.  My last chemo was on 2 March, and my hair came back very sparse and i had two totally bald patches on either side of my head just above my ears, i thought it was perhaps where i slept, rubbing the fine hair away.  But i didnt shave it off.  some say that if you cut/shave off the first wispy growth it grows back thicker.  I really don't know about that.  but within about six weeks my hair was even all over and wasn't wispy any more, it was actual 'proper' hair and growing thicker than it was originally, coming through a dark and a grey colour.  no bald patches.  On 22 May i stopped wearing my scarves and had my last radiotherapy session with hair showing.  it was about an inch or so long.  i bought a dye (no ammonia) from Boots and dyed my hair a sort of dark blonde/light brown colour.  i have always had highlights but it isn't long enough to go to the hairdressers for that yet.  it is now about 1.5 to 2 inches long and everyone says it looks great.  I like it, and it feels lovely and soft too, not coarse.  like you, i did think initially it wasn't ever going to grow.  It will.  x",
