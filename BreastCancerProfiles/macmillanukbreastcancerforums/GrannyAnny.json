      "Content": "Mum of patient. Yes, I did TCH and Pertuzumab too....I nearly threw the towel in on more than one occasion!! My oncologist cancelled my chemo at one point as I was so unwell!!! I didn't use the cold cap...I started losing my hair at about week 3 after cycle 1, hung onto it for another couple of weeks but then went and had it cut to a no.2! It felt so much better...I was quite chuffed with myself!! Ha!  Tell your daughter to \"hang on in there\"... ",

      "Content": "Hi... Can I just ask a quick question... At the risk of sounding completely dateless... If a breast tumour has \"pathologically disappeared\" with chemo what exactly will the surgeon remove during a WLE???  This is just a query...as I'm due to have a mastectomy! I just can't get my head around it!  And yes, I know, I do sound a bit booloo!  Thanks GrannyAnny",

      "Content": "Hi GILLY66 Its very 'odd' isn't it! I was advised that my chemo may very well destroy my tumour too but I'm definitely having mastectomy and wont be having another Mri to even check the tumour! It's because my tumour has the potential to send out random cells that are undetectable even on MRI which could grow into tumours!  I wrongly assumed, that if the tumour had shrunk then there would be a possibility of less severe surgery than an Mx!  Thankyou for the hugs...much appreciated right at this moment! Hugs to you too x  Love GrannyAnny x",

      "Content": "Hi everyone, just thought I'd share this with you...(hope you don't mind!)  I had a single mastectomy and full node clearance on 06/03/19... I was absolutely pooping myself to be honest!! I've been in a tight old tiz about this op for months...so devastated that I had to have my breast removed! The op went well (apparently!!) -was back on the ward at 6:15... I stayed in overnight (my surgeon had said I could go home but I said No..would have only been getting home at 10.30 pm!!! Ridiculous!!)  I feel remarkably well...much better than I envisaged to be honest!! My wound is HUGE...I was quite shocked when I looked at it... Goes from the centre of my chest right around to my back! I certainly wasn't expecting that! I thought I would have had a seperate incision for my lymph nodes! I have 2 drains in! Im managing to do my exercises without any problems.... I am pretty tired tho...I have to have a quick nod now and again!!  To be honest.... I'm quite proud of myself (at the risk of sounding like I'm booloo!!)... I seriously didn't think I could go through with the op but I did it!!!!!!  AND..after finishing chemo on 25/01/19...my hair is finally growing back.... It's only about 2 mm but we all have to start somewhere!! Ha! I'm ridiculously pleased....  Thanks for 'listening'  Love GrannyAnny x",
