      "Content": "Hi, Both me and Denise are going through our chemo at the moment, we have just had number 3 so half way there. I must say my best friend has been a lifesaver, she has never treated me any differently which is great, she never says I look rough even though I do, she just gets on with being my best friend as though nothing has changed. Some people find it difficult but she smiles at me the same as usual and I really appreciate the fact that I know she loves me regardless!As some have said, when I have just had the chemo, to be honest I don't even want to see her, until I am feeling well again, so don't take it to heart.Try to keep her included in as much as possible and treat her normally!Good luck!Jo.ps texting is great, phonecalls can give you a headache.",

      "Content": "Hiya, same age as me!I echo the info already given, I had chemo 6 weeks after surgery and radio 5 weeks after that.The chemo is cumulative, so you will get more tired as you go along, initially you should still have a fair amount of energy hopefully. I know it seems like such a long time for treatment, but it is amazing how you move through the process. I wish you well, you will probably have loads more questions as you go along, so keep posting. Many of us are in treatment or post treatment and we are all happy to help one another, we have all been there and know what it is like. Take care and loads of hugs. Jo x",

I had my op just over a month ago-I had days when I thought it felt better, only to be knocked back a couple of days later with a bad/painful day. Luckily every day it get's a little better , now (starting chemo tomorrow) I have virtually no pain, so it will get better...I promise! Just be patient with your body. Re the tearfulness.... I had a little cry this morning and feel much better, I must have just needed it. Hope you feel better soon and look after yourself. Jo x",

I still have some hair ...a very fine covering all over , but there are nearly bald patches on the top of my head. I am persevering because I still have a hairline which frames my face even in headscarves. Be warned it is uncomfortable for the fist 10 minutes, but then you are OK. I was also told I would lose my eyebrows and eyelashes, but so far these are still going strong!",

I spoke to my Oncologist who prescribed new tablets for me straight away(cyclazine) These really helped and stopped the dizziness. He said this was a common side efffect, although I did not experience this the first two cycles.Defiantely speak to your Oncologist, he will want to know so he can prevent this turning into fainting...",

I also had a haematoma so it can happen!Re the weight.. I have also put some on, but am not too worried because I am told the chemo diet will take it off again! I will be a little dissapointed if it doesn't happen.We are so lucky the Olympics are on, you are not the only one vegging out watching it. Good luck with your results and really try not to worry about the weight, I think it is quite nice to take some time to slob and eat the odd cream cake!",

I have just finished my FEC treatment, sat in bed hoping to feel more energy soon. But feeling positive. There are several of us on here on the FEC treatment, so feel free to ask away, PM if you want, I gave up work, but I think it is purely personal. You should be able to have a good active life, I still socialise and try to do the things I want, your body will tell you when it needs a rest.Wishing you and your daughter all the very best and I hope you keep smiling!!!Jo",

I am not sure I would have the chemo again, because of the side effects, but I have had zero problems with the Radio. My understanding is that the radio has few side effects, except a little tiredness, although I have not found it too bad at all.Good luck with your decision, I completely understan d why you don't want the chemo, but am not sure why you are not opting for the radio.
