Someone from there then contacted me and asked me to forward a cheque. (For £ 10.00 in my case). I then recd paper copies of scan reports and letters to GP and a DVD with operation notes, pathology reports and pictures of scans......although I have not yet managed to access the scans....i keep meaning to ring them - the young man I spoke to was very helpful said to ring him if I had any trouble accessing the DVd.....he gave me a password for the scans - keep meaning to ring him.....",

I had a R Mx in November and the pathology reports afterwards showed that my cancer had spread. I have lobular cancer and do not have a significant tumour but lots of little one ....which in the words of the surgeon are like \"grains of sand\". They willl do blood tests they tell me as I have high calcium levels which are \"tumour markers\" And hopefully will decrease if the LETROZOLE works.............don't fully understand this yet, but have the questions ready for my next visit........................I have read about KatieG's success with her tumour shrinking and take some reassurance from that? Side effects for me have been aching joints, and headaches. ..but nothing unbearable and if it's working then I'll accept it.. Hope it works for you, I shall read your posts ...........

      "Content": "It was the other way around for me. The surgeon was not at all supportive of my having a bilateral. The oncologist was. Initially I had a R mx and anx clearance. I was considering a DIEP recon and so when they did the R Mx they also did a reduction in the left breast to save doing it later. However when they analysed the tissue removed from the left breast, and despite the MRI showing it as clear they found cancer in the left side as well. I also had 'shadows' in the peritoneal area (abdomen) Which were 'probably' cancer so using tissue from there for a DIEP was compromised. I told my surgeon that I would just prefer a bilateral with no reconstruction. I had a temporary expander in the right breast so they would have to perform some sort of op eventually to remove that. The surgeon wanted me to have that replaced and just carry on ......it was futile he said to perform a bilateral since the cancer had already spread. I also have some bone mets. They put me on hormone therapy and just kept filling up the temporary expander, every time I saw the surgeon I told him that under the new circumstances I just wanted both breasts to go. After three months I had a tumour marker blood test which showed a 'huge drop'......a good sign, and my BCN said that they may, because of that reconsider the bilateral op. A meeting was held with the oncologist, the surgeon, the BCN, a psychologist , myself and my husband. The surgeon reiterated that it was futile surgery, but the Onc did say that since I had to have surgery anyway - to sort out this temporary expander - that it wasn't saving me a general anasthetic - and he could understand how I felt since in my mind it was reducing the amount of cancer in my body. I didn't get on too well with the expander, found it uncomfortable, but I know many people who are perfectly happy with implants Eventually the surgeon agreed, and I had a bilateral op three months later. I must say that the surgeon was a very nice man and I had full faith in him as a surgeon and his abilities, but he just had different opinions, he did say that my feelings were important and once he agreed to operate he never mentioned it again. I am much happier now. I wear a double prosthesis when I am out and about and go flat sometimes. So whether the Onc or the surgeon decides it seems to be a matter of their opinions, feelings, etc. whereas I think that it is OUR -the person with the disease - who should have the last say. I am in my early sixties so that may have some bearing on how I felt. A recent scan has shown that the mets in both the peritoneal area and the bones have reduced, some have disappeared!!! And my tumour markers continue to fall .......so I am hoping to be around with my flat chest for some time. :-))........\".................?..........................sorry I did use paragraphs when I typed this, but they don't work on iPads for some reason.",

      "Content": "Hello. I have just had another CT scan because I have been on LETROZOLE now for just over 6 months. The scan results this time were good. No new spread....I have secondaries but they have either remained the same or reduced in my bones. The peritoneal area has - \"almost completely resolved'. - so obviously we ' re moving in the right direction. However when the nurse was telling me these results I realised that I had missed some details on my first \"results feedback\"........nurse today told me that the mets in my pelvis were reducing. Now I was unaware that I had mets in my pelvis. When I just now looked at the notes I had jotted down when I was being given my first set of results I see that I have actually written the word 'pelvis'. I was so shocked when being given the first lot of results that I just jotted down odd words. My husband comes with me for results now but to be honest he is as wobbly as I am. I have decided that in order to be fully informed I would like copies of my results etc. I have never been offered them but understand that I am entitled to them. Should I ask for them? I am concerned that they make say I don't need them or something. Now that I am 7 months down the line I am feeling much more confident.......still wish it had never happened.......don't we all.....but want to be fully aware of everything now.",
