      "Content": "Hi everyone,  My mum was recently diagnosed with breast cancer. She had a lumpectomy and had 15 lymph nodes removed, 3 of which were cancerous. She got the results of the body MRI scan yesterday, and luckily there are no signs of secondary cancer anywhere. However, the consultant has recommended that she still has chemo in case any rogue cancerous cells are lurking in her body which didn't show up on the scan.  When we were showed the predicted survival rates (based on her stats), it says that having chemo only ads 1% onto the survival rate. I wonder if anyone else has been given the option of having chemo, and if you decided to do it, or just have the hormone treatment and radiotherapy instead?  She is 70 this year, and I wonder if it's worth going through the trauma of chemo for the sake of 1% increase in survival?  She asked me what I would do, and I said that I would do it - based on the fact that the chemo 'could' kill any rogue cells to prevent it turning into secondary cancer, but apparently there are no stats on how effective this actually is. Any help would be greatly appreciated! Thanks.",
