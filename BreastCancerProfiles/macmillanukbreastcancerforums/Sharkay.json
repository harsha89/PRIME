      "Content": "Hi everybody  I'm also new to this site , diagnosed 3 weeks ago and last week 3/05 had left mastectomy , and lymph nodes removed ,recovering slowly but surely and trying to adapt to pain levels - like burning / stinging , I've been told I will probably need chemo but have an appoint next week to discuss cytology results , a lot to take in with emotions all over the place , my family are so supportive but I feel so guilty that I've upset them so tend to stay quiet to not upset them .. Not sure if this is how other people on here reacted like this as I said its new and daunting at the moment  Apologies for waffling .",

      "Content": "Hi  I had a similar dilemma that knawed away , in April this year . Not only did I feel immense guilt at turning my children's life upside down but also my daughter aged 16 was revising for GCSEs and my son was finishing his final exams / dissertation for his degree. So I waited about 2 weeks for initial biopsy results date for op , and treatment plan of chemo . It was hell during those 2 weeks but my husband and I sat them down , when we knew son would be home and told them - they asked questions and having waited I had most of the answers which reassured them . We cried , hugged and when they said they felt useless I said no - revise , complete exams and kick cancers butt as I too had final exam for my degre ( that way actions are saying  cancer you are not winning !! It's not easy , but the relief was immense , we talk openly  about it as I didn't want it being an awkward elephant in the room , yes we've had outbursts and melt downs initially  but it makes me proud  how resilient , and strong they were .  You will find the time  and how best to tell them  Sharon X ",

My children are both inquisitive mites , I knew the news would  cause turmoil and  if I couldn't answer questions  fired at me I would increase this  further . So I was dreading saying I've got cancer , but knew this would follow with \" it's treatable - and this is the plan because the type of cancer is .,..  Best wishes  Sharon xx",

      "Content": "Thank you so much for these posts as they have given me a lot of reassurance. I was diagnosed with cancer in left breast and lymph nodes 3 weeks ago and had a mastectomy last week . I was not expecting this much pain , it's like burning sensation and tight pulling .i still have dressings and drain insitu - was supposed to be removed yesterday but still draining fair amount . I've been informed I will probably need chemo due to size of lump but waiting cytology report . This is all new to me and a lot to get my head round , friends and family have been amazing , but avoid the C word and cry if I mention it , so now I just stay quiet as I do t want to upset them any further as I feel guilty putting them through this . Sorry for my waffling .",

      "Content": "Hi clairelouB  Although I'm due to start chemo I can fully relate to where you are now - I had a pain and swelling  in left armpit  which  I put down to doing loads of decorating, went to GP , and referral made ..., biopsies later and ultrasound etc and was told I had a large tumour that was cancerous and cancerous axillary nodes - requiring a mastectomy , I was devastated , angry , shocked and my mind went into overdrive , when I told friends and family reactions ranged from tears of \" I'm so sorry\" to \" don't worry a mastectomy will get rid of it \" - solutions to a diagnosis that seemed to be my new  identity , that absorbed my thinking and actions . No one seemed to acknowledge the old me , post diagnosis , yes I wanted to run , deny needed a mastectomy and hating the cancer that was changing every aspect of me .  Then post mastectomy I was told my tumour was 8.5cm and 27 out of 29 lymph nodes were cancerous so friends reactions changed to me being lucky it was caught !! Lucky I thought !! It's changed my life and I'm lucky so again emotions spiralled from anger, fear and feeling stupid , self judgemental as to how I could not have noticed which was hard to get my head round  So I got a diary - and wrote it all down , spilled my anger , rage , anxiety out ..when I felt I needed to , my diary , a bit of me  that cancer couldn't control , and became a work book also to plan and prepare for each stage I may read it when I finish chemo , radiotherapy but I may burn it - my choice my control bit  Sorry for long winded blog - what I'm trying to say is use this forum - ( people are so reassuring , supportive and give wonderful advice \"listening \" to questions and anxieties .At the moment you will be overwhelmed with diverse emotions , don't isolate yourself , you will gain strength  you just need to find it and going through these emotions is a process , a means to find strategies and manage them - above all you on not alone  Best wishes  Sharon xxxx",

      "Content": "Hi  No you are not being silly at all , I received great invaluable advice and tips from ladies in this group from ladies in this group before I started  my chemo. I started a chemo box - my way of feeling incontrol , which contained: -Baby soft toothbrushes ( changed every 3 weeks/ new chemo cycle)  - mints / soft or chewy - skin moisturiser that I applied daily  - thermometer - diary ,to record daily temp , side effects,tabs taken - as sometimes patterns appear during chemo cycles  - bamboo caps , great for keeping scalp warm or cool and soft  - a journal ( personal choice ,to record experiences, feelings etc during my treatment journey which i find quite cathartic , I may keep or burn after wards- again my choice )  - evonail - recommended by a lady from this group , so far no problems and I'm due to have final chemo this week  - hand / foot cream , applied twice daily  - jel pad pillow insert , for hot flushes brought on from chemo ( also used cool spray when it was hot)  -  lip balm  Most important : listen to your body , rest when it tells you and drink loads  Good luck with your treatment , I found prep helped me a lot  Xxxx",
