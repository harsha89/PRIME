      "Content": "Hello everyone, I'm writing this on behalf of my Mum who is sitting next to me and a bit fed up. She had a mastectomy on Tuesday, very tired, generally positive and making jokes about it all but this morning she is desperate to take the surgical stockings off. Does anyone know if she could take them off now, 5 days after surgery. She is not walking about too much as she's so tired but she has been doing her exercises. Could anyone please give her a bit of advice? Also, she has an appointment to see a breast nurse in a couple of weeks but she doesn't really know what that entails.",

I'm planning to do the foot one this morning and am doing my physio throughout the day  with gentle strolls in the garden which is quite small  Do you reckon this is active enough?  Difficult to know what is meant by activity nowadays But will take your steer and phone someone sensible tomorrow when the rest of the world is up and about Thank you Pollymac",

Will talk to someone tomorrow   Thanks for your input Polly",

You dont know the half of it - shoddy treatment in all directions including giving me the wrong food (not gluten free) that is when they remembered me, the bathroom was cleaned but not the room in two days that I was there and I had the same glass for my water all the time  Didn't think of that until afterwards  The first night I was checked throughout the night the next night I didn't see a soul from 10.30 pm until the following morning  Am waiting until I know the results and start treatment and then I'm going to make quite a noise take care Pollymac",

      "Content": "Hello, Three and a half weeks and I'm still waiting for part of my biopsy results from my mastectomy to see if I need chemo.  Is this normal? Has anyone else had to wait this long or am I being impatient? Also, the surgeon took a lymph node out by mistake which he thought was a good thing. I am feeling so depressed that they are constantly ignoring me and this was through private healthcare. I feel like they have beaten every last bit of positivity out of me. He won't explain the grading and I don't even have any reports of anything so I have no idea what is going on. Pollymac",

      "Content": "Dear LeoLady 56 Thanks for your lovely supportive email When this whole process began three months ago - yup three months and counting I was very positive - cracking silly jokes like my signature tune was Thanks for the Mammories or Mammories are made of this - but bit by bit their ineffectual and disregarding attitude has worn me down I started with the NHS  I had breast cancer 27 years ago. My daughter had a lump at the same time three months ago and I nagged her to get it checked    Same consultant same hospital  She was fast tracked that morning Consultant/Mammogram/Ultra Scan/Consultant     Me - One week consultant  next week scans  biopsy  following week consultant   OK I know had to wait for the biopsy but that should have been done at the first meeting   But then I'm 74 so obviously as far as the NHS is concerned even though I was at greater risk of it being positive not so important So I chose to use the health insurance my husband (who I lost to cancer 7 years ago next month) had been paying for  Another mess  Wouldnt recommend it   Supposed to speed things up?  What a joke   They wont beat me and neither will this poxy disease once I know what I'm facing  That is when they deign to get off their butts and do their jobs At every point we have been battered down  even though at every point we have fought back and will keep on fighting Still the sun's out and the birds are singing  and I keep reminding myself other people are going through far worse things - just look at Grenfell Thanks once again Pollymac",
