    "Content": "I am caring for my sister and her dog, who is now very confused as my sister and I are so similar!  After diagnosis she couldn't let him sleep on her bed anymore as it was uncomfortable for her so he slept with me in the next room.  He's now back with her as she spends most of her time in bed but I feed him, walk him etc.  She has brain mets so sometimes says things like 'I've lost my dog' when he won't obey her very different voice.....it's sad..",
