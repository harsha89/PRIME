      "Content": "Hello Yvonne I am taking letrozole and have been for four and a half months in order to shrink the tumour before surgery. I empathise with you as I am having awful joint pain too, particularly in my legs,knees and feet. I also have about ten or more hot flashes per day with foggy memory and joint pain at night so find it difficult to sleep. I walk for half an hour every day to keep my joints moving and also take vitamin D and calcium together with a multiple vitamin and mineral pill. Also eat a lot of fruit, salads and vegetables. Removing oestrogen from our bodies with letrozole can give some extreme side effects. I will have to take this after my surgery for five years, too, but I am thinking of only doing this for a year so I can get some quality of life rather than longevity. Sorry you are finding the letrozole causes so much pain. It may improve down the line when your body adjusts to it a little more. Take care Heather",

      "Content": "Hello Pixielix I haven't put on much weight with letrozole. The joint pain is difficult and I have this mainly in my legs, hips feet and knees. I have been on them for nearly five months and for the last four months I ensure I walk every day usually around 2 miles. It is hard sometimes because of the joint pain, but I have persevered and it has helped and I think it is keeping my weight under control. I try to eat well with many fruit and vegetables in my diet and very little red meat. Hot flashes have decreased from 20 plus a day to around 10 a day so that is something. Sleeping is not great, but easier than it was. I can't say I have noticed any difference between different manufacturers. Blocking all oestrogen from your body twill result in the SEs we all seem to have experienced and it sure ain't easy sometimes as we know too well:) For me taking these prior to surgery has shrunk my tumour by nearly half and this makes all the SEs worthwhile. Take care Heather",

If you can, try to detach from the emotions you feel towards her as this will only reinforce your feelings of anger and pain and this will not be good for you and will push your cortisol levels up, never a good thing! I have experience of dysfunctional families as I come from one!  I have not seen my brother, wife and adult children for nine years now.  He certainly does  not know I have breast cancer and neither do I want him to know, as this will not change a thing and there has been too much damage in the intervening years.   Your father was absolutely right - our family of origin is not always our family of choice - very sadly. Take care of YOU and those who truly love you as they are the people who really matter, always with my thoughts and a hug to you Heather",

      "Content": "Hello Tmh I have been taking letrozole for two months which I believe is very similar to anastrozole. This is to shrink the tumour prior to lumpectomy. I saw the oncologist today and the tumour is softening and shrinking so he felt this is a good result so far, as did I. He was in a hurry with a busy clinic and when I mentioned the constant awful hot flashes and night sweats he seemed to think it was to do with the humid weather - I don't! LOL I am having a lot of joint pain too so I sympathise with you. Onc seemed to think the SEs would decrease in time. I am walking for Half an hour a day to keep the joints moving at least and taking vitamin D, and calcium, B complex, eating lots of fruit, vegetables and salad plus oily fish, salmon,tuna, sardines etc. also yoga and Pilates are supposed to be good for the joints . I believe anastrozole and letrozole are very successful cancer drugs for oestrogen receptor BC to block cancer from growing and protection after treatment so if you can somehow tolerate these side effects and hope they will improve maybe it is worth trying for a while longer. That is what I am doing for the moment:) With my thoughts. Heather",

      "Content": "Hello Fifelass I have not been on here for a while, but I was informed of your post - just also wanted to say hello to Dreamthief (George) :) I was diagnosed with oestrogen receptor breast cancer, HER2 negative (fortunately) back in April 2014.  My tumour was 48mm, so quite large, in my left breast.  The surgeon offered me two options, a mastectomy or letrozole to block all oestrogen (99%) from my body and shrink the tumour.  He told me if I took this option it could take up to 18 months to shrink to 2cms which would allow them to perform a lumpectomy.  I chose this option. The surgeon also told me that each option was medically the same as the other one in relation to treating the tumour.  I was on letrozole for 15 months with regular examinations at the breast clinic to check the tumour was softening and decreasing in size, which it did. The side effects of letrozole were not easy for me, but they did their  job of shrinking the tumour for less invasive surgery.  I really did not want a mastectomy, as I do not have small boobs, not big, but I would still have been lopsided afterwards and I was not willing to have a mastectomy if I could retain some of my breast.  As the surgeon said there was no difference between either option, I chose to have the letrozole to shrink the tumour first.. I had a four hour surgery at the beginning of last August 2015 with a partial  LD Flap reconstruction.  It was a bigger surgery than I thought it would be as unfortunately during the biopsy they had inadvertently seeded another cancer from the tumour biopsy on the skin of my breast.  Therefore this had to be cut out too to ensure this had not gone below the surface.  Because I was on the letrozole, the drug had prevented this occurring.  They also managed to leave my nipple so my breast is starting to heal and recover from the surgery and radiation and certainly looks much better than it did.  I completely understand how you feel about going for a long time with a tumour in your body.  Fortunately I did not feel this way, as each time I was examined the tumour was shrinking and softening and NOT growing or spreading.  It maybe that you may feel this way yourself as time goes on and your tumour starts to soften and shrink, which it is as you have said, and  they have told you it is softening which means it will decrease in size with time. My surgeon told me that oestrogen inhibitor drugs can take some time, but they do the job and also help systemically, meaning if a breast cancer cell moved to a different part of the body, the letrozole would stop it growing.  It is a very good drug and they probably  will want you to be on this for five years afterwards anyway. I understand that a year can seem like an eternity to be on the drug before surgery, but it will be worth it in the end when they will be able to do a lumpectomy rather than a mastectomy. My tumour shrank from 4.8cms to 2.2 cms, so more than half in fifteen months.  It was a long haul, I know, but you can do this and I would be very happy to be in touch with you, if you do make the decision to stay on letrozole,  to help in any way I can. Also, it may not be a year - it totally depends on how fast the tumour softens and shrinks ready for surgery. I hope I have helped in some way. With my thoughts to you and I am very happy to keep in touch. Heather",

      "Content": "Hello Carol I empathise with you regarding letrozole side effects, as I had a bad time with them too.  Many women struggle as AI inhibitors stop all oestrogen production and so we are almost without any oestrogen at all in our bodies, so of course this can affect our joints and muscles and has many other side effects!  Some fare better than others with this drug.  I was determined to stay on letrozole until I was able to have surgery.  I decided not to take it for the 5-10 year stint after surgery and radiation because of the SEs I experienced and my oncologist agreed with me With regard to the specific brand of letrozole making a difference, I can't say it did for me  to any extent although many on this board seem to have less SEs with different brands.  I used Sandoz mainly, which seemed to be  slightly better than the others.  It can depend on the fillers they use too as to whether the SEs can be more difficult.  IMO, it is a question of trying different brands and using the one that appears to be easier for you. I, too, have an underactive thyroid and I agree, it can be an inexact science getting the dose right as it can go up and down.  Personally,  I need my TSH level to be 1 or under, otherwise I have a problem.  There is certainly evidence to suggest that if you have a TSH level over 2, you will have problems, although the range for diagnosing an underactive thyroid is 0.33-4.  My body certainly needs to be below 2 and preferably below 1 for me to feel reasonable. As for statins, they wanted me on them several years ago and I refused.  This seems to have become a very controversial drug and the drug companies have been utterly disingenuous about the side effects. I am sorry to hear you have been getting extremely dry eyes and double vision.  I wonder if the double vision could be related to your extremely dry eyes.  I, too have dry eyes, more particularly during the night so use hypomellose drops.  I have had blephartitis for many years so this creates dry eyes.  I did find my eyes a little worse whilst on letrozole though.  It will be good for you to find out what is going on when you have your appointment at the hospital. Carol, please do not think you are complaining, you have breast cancer and and this is a serious diagnosis!   It is perfectly normal that you would feel like this.  Someone told me at the beginning of the cancer road back in 2014 that being diagnosed with breast cancer (or any cancer) was like being in a foreign land and having  to learn a foreign language.  This analogy was, for me, exactly how I felt.  This forum helped me enormously for over one and half years.  The people are terrific with so muchknowledge  time and empathy to help you through the road you are now travelling.  Believe me, you CAN do this, it will not be easy, but you will develop the inner strength and resilience that will hold you together with your treatment, - honestly.!  My experience of cancer and its treatment changed me hugely and in a positive way.  I realised, as have so many of us, just what was really important in my life and in life itself.   Please stay in touch and complain as much as you want. Wtih my thoughts to you. Heather x",

I am in Newcastle upon Tyne and had asked them about the R1 and R2 creams, but they told me that they had to conduct the research first, as you mentioned, so I used QV  cream, which radiography supplied to everyone.   Unfortunately I had a bad time with radiotherapy with lots of side effects - orange peel skin, fibrosis on the underneath part of the my breast and still  have a little oedema,  I do my arm exercises every day and have good movement.  I was checked six weeks after the finish of radiation and my oncologist told me that unfortunately I was in the worst category for side effects.  I still feel very tired at times, but my surgeon said this is perfectly okay and the extreme fatigue can last for months.   Five months on from rads, I still moisturise regularly with E45 although I have just started using Nivea for very dry skin conditions which feels wonderful and better than E45.  I use it on my boob and back scars where they took the Latissimus Doris muscle for the reconstruction and everything is healing well. Thank you for the information about RT and how wounds heal etc.  This gave much info about the effects of radiation on the skin, how it heals and what happens. Just want to say hello to George, Julia, and everyone who are still around.  My thoughts to you all. With every good wish Heather",

Back to oncologist beginning of June with possible discussion for surgery.  I am in pain all over my body sometimes and really wonder whether it is all the effects of the letrozole or there is something else going on.  My GP is going to do tests for polymyalgia and also muscle inflammation - lovely.  I still have nausea most days too. To say I am utterly fed up is an understatement and I haven't even had surgery yet.  By the time this lot is finished I might have died from something unrelated to cancer or the treatment LOLOL.

      "Content": "Hello again Dreamthief Yes, this might be an idea to start a new discussion. I am taking letrozole, whichis shrinking the tumour by almost half at this stage.  My biopsies confirmed ER positive (8x8) and HER2 negative.  I just hope there is nothing too much of a problem after surgery, which I doubt will be until next year.  My oncologist wants me to wait for surgery until the tumour has shrunk as much as possible so it is less invasive surgery.  This could be up to 18 months from the start of treatment.   With regard to radiotherapy.  I have read all the stuff on it, side effects, possible long term side effects which is why I would rather not go there.  I have not made this decision yet, but I am 69 now so being older,  I suspect I will tolerate the effects less than someone younger possibly.  I have also read the Macmillan article 'Cured but at What Cost' about the side effects of treatment being long term for a quarter of those who undergo cancer treatment.  I have also read something recently about people over 70s not beng pushed into chemo or radiotherapy because of their age and the body's inability to be able to deal with these treatments very well. I know I would feel differently if I was younger, but I am not and I don'twant to end up with my quality of life, of the much shorter time I have left, being a problem. This decision is not for many and frankly, if I was younger I feel it maybe be a different decision.  I am not afraid of dying at my age now - I am more afraid of living with the effects of surgery and radiotherapy or chemo. This is not a negative decision for me and my circumstances, it is an informed and wise possible decision.    I would like to express my appreciation to you and everyone on this site, where I have been able to learn so much about this terrible disease and about the wonderful courage of those ladies (and men) going through treatment. With every good wish Heather",

      "Content": "Hello everyone Does anyone know of a support group specifically for over 60s with breast cancer? I have been on letrozole now for four and a half months prior to surgery and maybe on this for several months more as my tumour has reduced in size by nearly half and oncologist wants it reduced even further for less invasive surgery. I know that a third of all women have to have further surgery if margins are not clear. I have also had skin cancer three.times plus the last one was on my face and while the 4 inch scar was healing, I found the tumour in my left breast, I now have what looks like another BCC on my upper right breast. Been to GP and she has measured it and given me cream to try but I am pretty certain this is another skin cancer. I know this can be cut out, but I feel very low at the moment. The letrozole SEs are not good either, but I am walking 2-3 miles a day to keep my joints moving. Hot flashes are not as many now, but I still have about 12 plus per day and I can feel sick and dizzy when they occur. The lack of oestrogen is also affecting my memory and the guy friend I had walked off in a huff like a 10 year old child ten days ago and have not heard from him since. We did not live together, but hey friends don't do this. This has been a fairly consistent pattern with his behaviour so doubt this is about the cancer. Needless to say I will not be welcoming him back into my life if he contacts me as I don't want to deal with a petulant child at the moment:) I am in Newcastle upon Tyne and have very few friends here. My son and close friends are in London and Harrogate so finding all of this very challenging and upsetting at the moment. I also have two busy voluntary roles, but am finding it difficult to focus at the moment. Sorry about the length of this, Thanks for 'listening' Heather",

It would be good if there members from newcastle for a little more real time maybe. It doesn't have to be a 60 threshold - guess I was just reaching out as I am not coping well. Are pathology results after surgery always different to the original diagnosis?. I am concerned about this and I do not think I want to have radiotherapy afterwards either. You are right ex ten year old was certainly adding to the baggage. I want to deal with an adult, not a child! Ain't life grand Appreciate your help Best Heather",

You say you are not able to talk. Could  you speak with a professional counsellor to help you through this? Would reconstruction help?   There are many ladies on here who have been through mastectomies and completely understand how you feel.  Everyone will be in touch to help you with my thoughts and a very big hug to you Heather",

      "Content": "Hello Judith I am in my 10th month of letrozole neo-adjuvant, as I believe you may remember.  I am so sorry you have so many SEs with Anastrozole.  I empathise with you  as I have SEs with letrozole particularly joint painin my legs, knees and feet.  Also hot flashes although much less than at the start.  Sleeping is a problem too with a few night sweats etc .  All of these SEs are, as we all know, because of the blocking of all oestrogen by the AI  drugs. I am not sure why different brands make any difference as they are all doing the same thing, and except for cipla, which I could not get away with, one brand is the same as the next as far as I am concerned.   With regard to tamoxifen, one of the SEs can be blood clots so even if I was offered this, I would not take it.   My personal opinion and experience  is that blocking all oestrogen will certainly have some very unpleasant SEs.  I have to take this as it is shrinking the tumour prior to surgery and protecting me from further problems hopefully, but  I will not be taking it after surgery and maybe will not do radiotherapy either.  My breast care nurse told me if it had to be a choice between 5 years of AIs and RT, I should have the RT as  AIs only gave you a 1 percent more protection of recurrence. On a positive note, the, lady who suggested taking the mineral magnesium, I took her advice - she said that clinical trials had shown 250-500 mgs of magnesium helped decrease hot flushes.  I read some of the clinical research on the Internet and it appears as though there is alot of substance to this.  One  of the reasons is that that depletion  of oestrogen lowers the levels of magnesium a lot in our bodies, which can contribute to hot flashes.  Magnesium is a very iimportant mineral for our bodies in many ways .  There is a lot of information about this.   It has been making some difference to my hot flashes as they are not as intense and have a reduced length of time.

      "Content": "Hello Snowys Mum I am so sorry you are having some side effects to Letrozole, but it is very early days.  Of course the vertigo may not be connected.  I was on letrozole for 16 months and in the beginning had awful side effects, felt nauseous all the time and also felt dizzy  and I did have a few bouts of vertigo, but I had vertigo sporadically before letrozole so was not sure that it was necessarily one of the side effects  from it.  Vertigo is very unpleasant so I empathise with you! I also had a very bad time with hot flashes initially and would feel nauseous and dizzy before they started.  My experience with letrozole was not great particularly with my joints, but the initial SEs of 20 plus a day hot flashes and feeling nauseous  did diminish a lot  over the first few months until my body adjusted. You could ask your breast care nurse or your pharmacist about this.   I found that they were very helpful with information about letrozole. For me I took letrozole for sixteen  months before my recent surgery and it decreased my tumour size from 4.8cms to 2.2cms - so it did its job:) I have not taken it since my surgery because of the side effects, and I have to have radiotherapy next month, so I am considering whether I want to do five more years on this.  As I am 70, I may not.   I hope you start to feel better from the vertigo and it would be a good idea to contact your GP if it continues.

Your husband is going through the journey with you and it will affect him too very much...and possibly make him angry too when he has no control over what is happening to you and adjusting to  the major changes he has made in his life by giving up his job to be your carer.  He sounds like an amazing guy:)  A cancer diagnosis changes many things, but in my humble opinion, and experience, it also gives you a very different perception of what life really means and what and who are really important.  This takes time as do your feelings about all of this and their impact upon you, your life and your husband and family.  We are all travelling via a pathway with which we have no familiarity at all and we have to make unique and painfully difficult decisions.  In the end I believe that this will and can make us all incredibly strong with an understanding of what it really means to be human, that we never had before.

      "Content": "Hello Helen I have been on letrozole for six months prior to surgery in order to shrink the tumour.  It was 48mm and is now 26mm x 27mm, at the beginning of September, so   has shrunk 40% in just four months.  I understand completely about aching joints, insomnia and mood swings.  My joints are very painful particularly at night when I am in bed.  To try to keep them moving so it does not disrupt life too much I walk about 2-3 miles per day.  It does make a difference as they are less stiff.  I also take vitamin D, calcium and B complex.  I also eat a lot of fresh fruit, salads and vegetables and very little red meat, just chicken and fish.  I do eat chocolate sometimes as I do not drink or smoke so figure I want to do something nice for me  - Well that's my excuse anyway LOLOL Initially was also getting over 20 hot flushes per day.  These are much less now and down to less than half that number.  My oncologist said that he would change the pills, but there was not a lot of choice.  I decided to stay with letrozole, the devil I know!   The problem is that these Aromatase inhibitors all have the same core action of blocking oestrogen from our bodies, which results in various similar  side effects.  I was reading an article today in the Mail about women who go through the menopause and have very similar side effects and how difficult it is for them.  The problem for us ladies with these AIs, is that we have very little, if any,  oestrogen in our bodies, so the side effects are much worse.  After menopause when the ovaries stop producing oestrogen, we still have some oestrogen in our bodies and  HRT is an option depending on our GP.  I took a very low dose of HRTpatches  for many years so did not go through the menopause.  When I started on the letrozole and came off HRT of course as my BC is ER positive (8x8).  You know how women dream of wonderful looking guys, like Jose Mourinho - well I dream about oestrogen - honestly:) I live on my own too, Helen, although I am retired, but do voluntary work pretty full time.  I do understand that sense of being on your own with all of this and not feeling supported.  I have the surgery ahead at some point in the next few months.  The breast care nurses have never returned three calls over the last six months so I gave up.  I then called MacMillan support linerecently  and had a very nice volunteer on the phone who said she would have a BC nurse call me. That was two weeks ago and no call.  I give up and just read the posts on here for support or information. I am so sorry that you feel you have not had the care you need and that you did not have a mammogram for your yearly check,which would give you more comfort when you are so anxious and also the fact you were told you could have reconstruction and now you cannot.  Did he say why this was?

We discussed me going back to the letrozole or other hormone inhibitor, but I had written down many of the side effects I had taking this for  15 months prior to my surgery and that I felt I could not go back on them again.  He agreed that the side effects I experienced would result in awful quality of life against only a small percentage in preventing recurrence risk,  3%. and felt that it would be better for my life quality not to take these anymore.  He also felt that even a different AI would not make much difference to me.  Anyway with his support, I feel as though I have made the right decision for me..   So this is it, the end of my treatment - just have to go back to see my surgeon for my six monthly check next February.  I feel very, very glad it is all over after 20 months and I want to move forward now and live life again, once the tiredness and radiation effects have diminished. I am so very grateful for this site and for those  ladies and guys who have supported me and helped me through this cancer diagnosis and treatment from beginning to end.  You have my  huge appreciation and my thoughts for all of your comfort, kindness, wisdom and understanding.  I could not have done it without you all pushing me forward. For all those beginning this  journey, know that you can do it, one day at a time.  Try not to look ahead too far, remain in the present if you can, and each day your treatment will be gathering pace reaching out towards the end of treatment and then healing and recovery.  You think it will never come, the end of this cancer road, but it can and it does.  I have seen such courage here.  It has moved me so much and taught me even more about the human spirit and the will to survive this dreadful disease and its treatment.  I know this - I will never be the same person again as I  realise now just how fragile and precious life is and that those people you love become even more precious to you.  It has also given me great glimpses of the endurance and courage of the human spirit and I have also seen humanity at its  very best. I would particularly like to thank George for all his humour and his wisdom, Helen, Julia and everyone who took the time to respond to my posts.  Thank you each and everyone of you. With my warm personal regards to you all and may Christmas bring something beautiful and much comfort for each of you. Heather",

My surgery will not be for a while, at least not until the tumour is under 2cms or less as the oncologist wants it as small as possible so surgery is less invasive. They have told me this would be followed up with radiotherapy and then five years of letrozole. I doubt that I will do the radiotherapy but might continue on the Letrozole for a while. I am in my late sixties now and want quality of life rather than longevity. If I was younger my choices might be different. My oncologist told me that when you have radiotherapy, you have to wait quite a while for reconstruction.. Iam so sorry they are not following through with reconstruction for you, but there must be a way to have this done esoecially as it has been a year since surgery and rads.and more importantly it is affecting your confidence. IMHO, you need to pursue this, The cancer fast lane sure ain't an easy road! For me I have found that laughter is an excellent antidote to a cancer diagnosis and the treatment that follows and very, very healing. I wish you peace and laughter. Heather x",

No, you are not raining on my parade, not at all. I do understand the possible psychological effects and I am seeing a consultant clinical psychologist from the hospital who specialises in helping cancer patients during and after.  I have seen her twice so far as I have felt up and down and will be seeing her again this month.   I think  one of the more difficult problem when you have cancer is that people really do not have a clue just how painfully difficult it is, physically, psychologically and emotionally.  Some are more sensitive than others.  I know there has been a thread about the things people say.  It is truly awful.  The only thing you can do is try to have a sense of humour about it as people who do this are usually very low on the sensitivity and empathy scale. I had someone say to me that she would be happy to have both her breasts off as they were too big and she didn't like them.  I said gently, I don't think you would be quite so flippant if you had cancer in one or both of them.  It is not as easy as that!! Take good care of yourself Heather",

      "Content": "Good morning Dreamthief Thank you for this. i totally agree with everything you have said here. As if we all don't have enough going on with cancer diagnoses and treatment, an article about oestrogen in dairy products being linked to breast cancer would create further anxiety for us all! There  is so much conflict on what we read everywhere. One day we should not have butter, whole milk or eggs as they create health problems, down the line we are informed they are good for us.  I never took any notice of any of that.  It would drive us all crazy trying to keep up with what we can or can't eat or drink.  As you say, George,every thing in moderation and a little of what you fancy does you good good wishes Heather",

Words are so important and you said something very significant - 'but there are so many things that I do not like about him still and am not in love with him'.  I have often felt that if you find many things you do not like about a spouse or loved one, then there is a huge problem in my humble opinion - because we  cannot be in an emotionally  healthy relationship if we do not like many things about our partner. My opinion would be that you should go with your inner feelings, which appear to be very powerful particularly as you were planning  a rather different future prior to your cancer diagnosis.  It certainly does not sound as though staying with our husband is an option for you or your husband,  because you would be 'settling' for a marriage you wanted and needed to leave, prior to diagnosis. Just my thoughts based on my own experiences... Take care and as Shakespeare said - 'To Thine Ownself Be True, always:) Heather",

My experiences on letrozole were pretty awful, extreme joint pain knees, hips, feet, neck, tiredness, 8-10 hot flushes per day, constipation, stomach problems and generally feeling as though I was not 'me' anymore.  I had to keep going to take the letrozole as it was doing its job and shrinking the tumour.  Pathology results showed tumour at 2.2 cms so the tumour size had reduced by 2.6cms and no cancer in the three lymph nodes they took.  After surgery and during my five days in the hospital I asked my surgeon if I could have a break from the letrozole.  He said I could have a two week break and when I asked for longer, he said that would be okay, but I must discuss it with my oncologist when I started my radiotherapy, which starts this Saturday for three weeks.   I told my oncologist I could not face going back on the letrozole  while I was going through RT and the side effects.  He said this was ok and that we would discuss this when my treatment has finished.  I think it is highly unlikely I will go back on any of these Aromatase inhibitors as they impacted my life so much and, for me, I want quality of life not longevity.

I empathise with you on your energy levels and low mood as I have these too in addition to hot flashes (not as many as the beginning) and joint pain.  I have not gained weight, not that I ever weigh myself, but clothes are fine.  I think this is because I don't feel very hungry most of the time and eat less than I did before I was on letrozole.  However, I do walk just about every day about 2miles to keep my joints moving as they feel so stiff  and uncomforable in the mornings and when rising from sitting or being in bed.  I think the walking helps to balance effects of weight gain  and I eat a lot of fruit and vegetables, very little red, meat, just chicken, salmon, tuna and sardines. I used to eat like this before cancer diagnosis so nothing much has changed, except I eat less.   I do like rice and bread, but not much for pasta or potatoes I don't drink or smoke, but I do like chocolate sometimes:). Blocking oestrogen from our bodies on these hormone inhibitor drugs will have quite a few  side effects. I would highly recommend walking, if you feel up to it, maybe  just around the block and gradually increase each day.  I started at ten minutes and now do about 40 minutes depending how I feel.   Are you taking letrozole after having had your treatment?   With my thoughts Heather",

As you describe your breast tumour as smallish and already decreasing in size, this is great news.  As it shrinks, it also becomes softer, which is good.  Letrozole can take time to reduce size, but it ensures that oestrogen levels are dramatically reduced thus taking away the oestrogen that oestrogen receptor cancer needs in order to grow.   Letrozole works well and if you also keep fit, this will help your joints.  I walked two to three miles a day whilst on letrozole to keep my joints reasonable With thoughts to you Heather",

Do you mean don't do any heavy lifting on op side before surgery or after?  I did have a bonedensity scan last week as my oncologist requested this when I started on the letrozole although it took a long time for an appointment.  I do not know the results yet.  I am sorry to hear that your bone density results are edging toward osteoporosis and I know this is a very common side effect. I exercise by  walking every day for about half an hour and also eat a lot of fruit, salads and vegetables,but I always have.  I am sorry about your hair loss - is a little or a lot or just thinning?  I haven't noticed anything yet, but have only been on the drug for 9 weeks.  I am sosorry you have been on your own through all of this and that you had moved to a new location.  That must have been very challenging for you when you most need your friends and family around - well depending on the relationship you have with them!   I have a guy friend who has been around and very caring, but unfortunately this means he is here at my home more, which I appreciate, but it is not ideal for many personal reasons.  i have one son of 27 and he lives and work in London.  He has been very supportive, but, again he is not here and works crazy hours.  Otherwise I have no social network up here in the Northeast.  Friends are in the London and Yorkshire area.  I have been to a place called 'Maggie's' which is wonderful.  It is a cancer centre and I believe there are 17 around the UK. I do try to look at this in a more positive way,but I am not succeeding really.  I am a very strong woman but somehow this diagnosis has prevented me processing this differently.  I have been offered antidepressants by my doctor, but I do not want them.  In fact I feel as though I do not want anything else that is toxic to my body.  The cancer and letrozole are enough together with several other pills I take for blood pressure and hypothyroidism. I so appreciate your thoughtful response ...thank you so much. Best wishes Heather",

I have been hypothyroid for several years and on 125 mcgs per day although this can go up and down as it is a very inexact science as I am sure you know:) I am not sure I could continue with letrozole or something similar after surgey and radiation.  I feel like you, quality of life over longevity of life:) With regard to TSH levels only,  I know exactly what you mean, but sadly that is exactly what they do, or more accurately what the labs do.  If you are within range then all is well - NOT.  The whole hypothyroid debate is a complex one  and it seems that some GPs do not look at the whole picture  of physical effects and how the patient feels - and sadly, neither do some of the endrocrinologists. Funny old world.... Take care Heather  ",

      "Content": "I was diagnosed with grade 2 breast cancer in April, 4cms. It is oestrogen receptive so I am on letrozole for past two months plus. Hot flashes at least 15 plus per day, night sweats, bad joint pain in legs feet and knees. Still have some nausea and very tired and in a low mood sometimes. Oncologist appointment last week. Oncologist pleased with result as tumour softening and possibly slightly smaller. He was a different oncologist from the one I had been seeing and was rather brusque and obviously in a hurry so not conducive to any questions but told me that those not on letrozole would be feeling hot as the weather had been humid! I decided not challenge this remark as he made it apparent he had limited time.. I go back again in September to see if the tumour has decreased any more so we can discuss lumpectomy surgery. Then there will be radiation and then on hormone meds for 5 years. I have called my BCN several times leaving a message and have not had a response on two occasions, then I called Macmillan support to talk with someone and after 15 minutes of waiting with the same message playing over and over, I gave up. This support board has given me a lot of information, somewhat frightening at times but the courage shown by so many women and men is breathtaking and humbling. Outside of this Board, I have felt somewhat unsupported by my oncology team. I know how busy they are but This cancer diagnosis changes your life as you know and it is like living in another world reality and learning a different language. Help please... Best wishes Heather",

      "Content": "Thank you, Helen.  I appreciate your response and you are right Oncologists and cancer teams have to be detached from all the emotive issues and of course only those have travelled this route can truly understand. Without a doubt, removing just about all all oestrogen from your body via these drugs causes all kinds of effects.  It is not just like going through menopause but much more than that because there is no oestrogen at all. I think if I was younger, I may have a somewhat different perspective, but frankly at 68 and with this gruelling time ahead and years on this drug to limit cancer returning is not how I wanted to live the few latter years of my life.  I have been a very busy person in retirement having two voluntary roles which are pretty full time.  Now I do not have the energy for much and the joint pain is a real problem.  I think if I was taking letrozole, having surgery down the line and then radiation and then could stop taking letrozole, I may feel differently. Thank you for your thoughts:) Heather",

      "Content": "Hello Chloecat So sorry to hear you had a minor stroke and that it affected your  right eye, although very  happy   to hear all was well in the neck arteries and brain.  In 2008, I had a macro aneurysm in my right eye, which I know is not the same, but it was like a laser light show going on in my eye and a little frightening. The major contributory factor was high blood pressure over a period of time.  I was already on two blood pressure pills anyway.  However, i was very lucky and only have a small area at the bottom of the right eye that has a little grey area.  The bleeding in the eye resolved over a period of ten months as the blood was absorbed back into my blood stream.  Apparently it just missed my central vision so I was very lucky.  In fact my reading is better in my right eye than my left eye...ironic!  There was a lot of bleeding because at the  time I took low dose aspirin, which created a bigger bleed.  I do not take it any more. They added another BP pill making three, but it keeps my blood pressure very low!  You are absolutely right about about BP.  It is so important to get BP checked regularly or get a cuff and check it yourself, preferable when resting with your feet up so it is a realiable indicate of if blood pressure is healthy at rest. As for me, I am fine, two years past my operation and partial reconstruction back in August 2015.  Had a scare three weeks ago as had a problem with it, swollen, red etc.  They were very quick and had mammogram US and they expedited the results for the following day, it was an infection.  Antibiotics cleared it up.  I have lymphodema in the reconstructed boob from the radiation, but manage this with massage.. My cholesterol is 6.7, but due to the never ending controversy about statins, I do not take them.  I am in Helen's court over this one, but I think it is up to every individual as to what they feel is better for their health. Take good care of  yourself and I wish you a full recovery in your eye. With many best wishes Heather",

      "Content": "Hello Julia :) How are you?  I have been following this thread, as although I do not receive forum emails now into my inbox, this thread has arrived in my email. I agree with all your thoughts here.  It is a very individual choice to make an informed decision about treatment, whether conventional or otherwise as long as we have looked at all the clinical information on both sides of the cancer coin, so to speak. As for me, I am happy that  I made the right choice for me with conventional treatment of neo adjuvant letrozole for 15 months prior to my surgery and  LD flap  reconstruction, then radiotherapy.  I had horrible side effects with the letrozole but it did the job of shrinking the tumour from 4.8 cms to 2.2cms,  I was also lucky in having a very skilled surgeon, and ten and half months on the scars on my breast and back are healing well, although I do have lymphoedema in my boob.  This is, of course, because of the radiation, but funnily enough the skin on the actual LD flap, is just fine, it is the rest of the skin on the  boob that has been a problem because of the radiation. I am awaiting an appointment at the Lymphoedema clinic now Had a mammogram last week, so awaiting the results which could take up to four weeks.  I am not taking the adjuvant letrozole for five years as both myself and oncologist felt that the side effects I had against the percentage of recurrence would  affect my quality of life.  But hey-ho, I am seventy and I am grateful for extra time, so whatever will be WILL be. I am enjoying my life now, albeit a little slower with less energy at times, but I am grateful to be alive and have had good support from the NHS and my surgical team here in Newcastle upon Tyne. I would like to pass on my thoughts and warmest wishes to those on the board who are undergoing cancer treatment..  I am  different in many ways from before my diagnosis, as we all are, but I believe these changes have been profound and positive for me. Take care dear Julia Heather xx",

      "Content": "Hello Chloecat How very interesting about the difference between a astrodome and letrozole.  As my tumour was 4.8 cams, this could well be the reason for letrozole.  With regard to Sentinel node excision, I believe this always part of a lumpectomy, although I did say to the surgeon that I did not want an axiilary clearance should there be cancer cells in the SN.  He said that may not be necessary.  This was on 10th June and he gave me two weeks to think about my decision for surgery as he feels that it can be done now.  Apparently my tumour is now 2.5-3 cms and the letrozole has stopped its growth and it has shrunk. According to mammogram in February i have an appt on Wednesday to tell surgeon I want to go ahead with surgery as I have to come off the letrozole for a while because of severe side effects.  I have been on this for 14 months now and I am grateful it has decreased the size , but my quality of life has been affected in a huge way so I need to now start the road  of surgery at least.  I feel apprehensive about what is ahead as I am now 14 months down the line and this all just beginning.... i do eat pretty decent food with a great deal of fruit and vegetables every day.  I  eat some carbs, mainly rice and bread and very little meat mainly chicken and some fish, but did this prior to cancer diagnosis. Not keen on red meat for about 20 years now.  I do have some dairy and do not want to give this up.  I also walk most days for half an hour, but have to grit my teeth as letrozole has affected my joints so badly. thank you so much for all the information.  You have very obviously conducted hugely in depth research into cancer and I am very glad you are sharing this with us all. take good care  with my very good wishes to yo Heather",

      "Content": "Hello Helen, Lavender girl and everyone on this thread I am not on this forum very often now, but I was for twenty months whilst going through treatment.  This thread has come through to my inbox and I thought I would give my thoughts and experience as people on this forum supported and comforted me during those long months.   I learned so much from so many extraordinary women and men going through a breast cancer diagnosis.  I am over two years in remission and cancer free in the present time.  I was on letrozole for 15 months prior to     Surgery where I also had reconstruction.  My tumour was rather big, 48mm, hence the long time on letrozole in order to avoid a mastectomy.  I ended up with a partial mastectomy and LD flap reconstruction at the same time so was a four hour surgery.  This was followed by three weeks radiation six weeks later. Unfortunately I had a bad time with the radiation, but I got through it and I was lucky I did not need chemotherapy.  My tumour was Oestrogen receptor cancer (8x8).  They took three lymph nodes and there was no cancer there, so I consider myself to be very fortunate. I had a bad time with the letrozole during the 15 months, but it is all a very individual experience as some ladies only experience minimal effects.  I was familiar with Chloecat's thread, and at one stage considered alternative options myself as her threads are informed and honest about her experiences in the alternative routes.  However I made the decision to go with the medical science route and I did this because I was able to discuss  my thoughts and feelings with others on this forum and make what I considered to be an informed choice.  I also chose not to take letrozole for five years after treatment because of the side effects.  This was discussed and agreed with my oncologist.  As we all go forward with the courage strength and resilience that it takes with a diagnosis like this, we can support each other with all our different views and feelings because in the end we have each other to draw on and share our fears, our laughter and our tears and we can become stronger because of it. My thoughts are with you all as you take this road and when I was first diagnosed back in April of 2017, someone said to me...cancer diagnosis is like being in a foreign land where you have to learn a foreign language rather quickly.  How right she was, but in my experience it also  gives you a strength you never knew you had and you are different at the other end , but in a way that is profoundly positive...funnily enough...

      "Content": "Hello Pat I am Heather77 who Dreamthief refers to:) I was diagnosed with Invasive ductal carcinoma in April of last year. It was oestrogen receptor positive (8x8) so the fully monty, so to speak:)  My tumour size was quite big - 4.8cms.  According to the ultrasound, there was no evidence of lymph node involvement.   My surgeon gave me two options, which were a mastectomy or an Aromatase Inhibitor, letrozole, which could  take  up to eighteen months to shrink the tumour to below 2cms for lumpectomy surgery.  As Dreamthief said, I was on letrozole for fifteen months and I had surgery in the form of a quadrantectomy, removing the tumour, (2.2 cms) three sentinel lymph nodes and a partial LD flap reconstruction.  At diagnosis the surgeon said each option was clinically the same. Letrozole is very similiar to anastrozole and is another AI hormone inhibitor.  The surgeon was very happy with the results as they checked me throughout  the fifteen months - the tumour softened  hugely and kept shrinking slowly, but surely, so in fact by the time I had surgery on 3rd August, two and half weeks ago, it had decreased in size by 2.6cms. Not only was it not growing, but it was shrinking!  The action of letrozole and all four hormone inhibitors  blocked the oestrogen from allowing the tumour to grow.  There are indeed side effects and they can be very challenging, BUT it absolutely did its job. My tumour pathology results on Tuesday were such wonderful news.  The surgical team got all the margins!!  There were NO cancer cells in the three lymph nodes they took.  I have to heal and recover for a further four weeks as it was a significant surgery and then will be having three weeks of radiotherapy at the Freeman Hospital here in Newcastle.  This is a safety valve to give more of a chance of  stopping any random cancer cells still in my breast. The surgical nurse who saw me on Tuesday in addition encouraged me to stay on letrozole or one of the hormone inhibitor drugs as apparently it decreases the chances of the cancer returning or spreading by 25%.  I have had two and half weeks break from letrozole and a further two weeks prior to seeing the oncologist before having radiotherapy.  The nurse suggested that even taking letrozole and having two week breaks on occasion was far better than not taking it at all.  They want me to discuss this with the oncologist prior to RT. So, Pat, it has certainly been my experience that hormone inhibitors such as Anastrozole, letrozole, Arimidex and Exestamane are VERY effective and absolutely necessary.  The SEs can be awful, but seem to vary from person to person.  The main experiences I had were extreme joint pain, hot flashes, night sweats, extreme tiredness and lack of energy.  I gritted my teeth and kept on going and I am very happy with my pathology results and my surgical team and the wonderful nurses who took care of me during my stay in hospital - and, as I expressed in a recent post, the caring and huge support I received on this extraordinary Macmillan Forum. Sorry for the length of this, but hope this helps:) Heather ",

I was diagnosed in April with grade 2 cancer and at the moment I am on a hormone cancer drug as the cancer is oestrogen led and this removes all the oestrogen in order to try to shrink the tumour, so it will shrink to 2cms from 4cms - eventually, hopefully,  and I can have a lumpectomy rather than a mastectomy followed by radiation.   Side effects of letrozole are difficult and will have to stay on this for years after treatment, which definitely does not 'float my boat'  lol. I totally understand about about the media and the portrayal of cancer survivors and  I, too, have wept a lot in the past couple of months and understand about the empty house, although my guyfriend stays over sometimes.  I am sure everyone with cancer have many painful and negative thoughts throughout their diagnosis, treatment and after everything is over, because it seems to me that once you have this diagnosis, it is never really over and the world is a very different place once we have stepped over this line in the sand. I would be very happy to 'talk' on an individual basis and can give you my private email address, although I am not sure that they allow you to do this on the board.  I could find out though.  I will have a look at the rules etc. as I am very new on here.

      "Content": "Hello FelinesareFab Definitely not a rant, just your feelings about your diagnosis and many other things that are going on in your life. It is strange how a cancer diagnosis emphasises the true nature of our relationships with family and friends and how we re-evaluate so much in our lives that was probably simmering beneath the surface anyway. I certainly know that this is the way it is for me. I have explored so much in my life since this diagnosis and with a very traumatic event eight years ago. I understand and identify with some of your thoughts on older people in the UK and invisibility, friends talking about being positive and the journey we are on! The reality is that it is difficult to be positive without the love and unconditional support that everyone needs in their lives more particularly with a serious and possibly life threatening disease. This is a time we really do need human contact and shoulders to lean on and arms to support us. You are so right that there is NO substitute for human company and I am so deeply sorry that you do not have this and how raw you are inside. Please keep in touch if you feel comfortable doing this as I really would like to know how you are feeling. You are in my thoughts. Heather",

      "Content": "Hi Jan Yes,  feeling this way and very tired is perfectly normal after only six weeks!   You had MAJOR surgery and you will not feel too good for quite a while.  Your body has been through a lot with an LD flap reconstruction, so it is rather battered and needs to reserve energy in order to heal and recover.  You need plenty of sleep which is when your body uses reserves to heal. My surgeon told me it would take two months or more before I could drive and that I should just potter for a couple of months or more.  I am retired, but I do work from home in a voluntary capacity which can be very busy at times.  I did not feel like doing much for quite a while and felt very tired and in pain sometimes too. With regard to your customers, are they thinking of you in pestering you to go back?  Of course not.  IMHO, I think it may be wise to tell them that you have had cancer and major reconstruction surgery and you are not ready to go back yet.  It would not be conducive to go back to hairdressing after only six weeks recovery,  as this is a very active job with regard to using the side where you have had surgery  -  and the movement would be difficult for you and hinder your healing. The exercises are very important - I still do mine one year after surgery.  Have you had any physiotherapy with some massage on the scar on your back to help the skin?   Jan, my advice to you is to try and relax, not to worry about how long  your recovery is taking.  Everyone is different, but remember your body has undergone  a lot of trauma with an operation like this.  It needs time - lots of it - to gradually recover.  Relax and allow your precious body to do this:) Take good care of YOU - your customers will have to wait! with every good wish and my thoughts to you.

      "Content": "Hello jwoowoo I had a partial mastectomy and an LD flap reconstruction August last year.  Five weeks is a hugely short time for your healing and recovery.  This is a major operation.  The surgery involves taking your back main muscle, and tunnelling this muscle, breast tissue and blood vessels under your arm into your breast.  Your body has undergone a traumatic operation and it takes much time to heal.  I expected miracles too and realised that my body needed time, care and rest as I gradually recovered more movement and energy.  I was on pain killers for a couple of months after the operation.    It takes quite a lot of time to feel normal again and everyone is different in their healing and recovery.  Take it easy on yourself and take one day at a time.  Try not to have definitive expectations of how soon you should be fully recovered.  Getting your strength back will happen very gradually physically, emotionally and psychologically.   For me it took around six months to feel normal again and to regain all the movement, energy and strength.  The breast care reconstruction nurses told me it can take up to a year for full recovery. Eventually all will be well again..... With my thoughts and a hug Heather",

Laughter, lots of it,  is very healing and this is what got me through. Good wishes Heather x",

I was diagnosed in April of 2014 with a 4.8cm tumour.  The surgeon gave me a choice of taking letrozole as my tumour was oestrogen receptor cancer in order to shrink the tumour and  decrease the size to 2cms or below for surgery - or have a mastectomy.  I chose the first option in order to avoid a mastectomy.    I was on letrozole for 15 months prior to surgery last August 2015. It decreased the tumour from 4.8cms to 2.2cms when I had the surgery and a partial mastectomy with an LD flap reconstruction. It can take some time depending on the size of the tumour, but it worked for me. Please feel free to ask any questions at all and I will help in any way I can. With my thoughts to you and a hug.

      "Content": "Hello again Gill Yes, if you have small breasts a 14mm tumour would feel rather large and scary.  Mine certainly felt large at 48mm and I do not have small breasts, more medium plus size.  I was also diagnosed with grade 2 ductal carcinoma ER positive 8/8, HER negative. Don't know the Ki67 8%, will check this out. As far as I am aware, and I am  not a medical person, letrozole can stop the tumour from growing and then start to shrink it as oestrogen levels become extremely limited.    My surgeon originally told me I could be on letrozole for around 18 months as it depends how soon it starts to work to decrease the size.  I would suggest that they would be more concerned if your tumour was increasing rather than not decreasing in size at the moment .  With the two weeks pf tamoxifen you were taking this means you have been taking  letrozole for ten weeks, so I am sure it will have stopped it growing and maybe just taking some time to start to decrease the size of your tumour. I totally understand about the side effects of letrozole.  I had all the side  effects you mention plus several more.  The hot flushes  were dreadful.  I was getting around 20-25 per day - previously I had been on HRT for many years, so I think going from having a supply of oestrogen to hardly any at all, gave me extreme  effects.  After around six months the hot flushes settled down to 8-12 per day.  I still hated them though, but I was determined to persevere. I, too, had awful problems with my joints.  I am afraid this lack of oestrogen affects many parts of the body, more so than the natural menopause.  I used to  walk two to three miles every day to keep my joints moving and this did help.  I would also suggest  that you moisturise your skin very well as it can become dry and drink plenty of water, fresh fruit and vegetable etc. You will probably notice that you feel more tired, but walking or some form of exercise helps to keep the oxygen circulating:) I bought those little battery operated fans which I always carried in my handbag for when I had my inevitable daily hot flushes. I also found laughter was the greatest healer of all and I laughed a lot and posted on this forum for help when I felt low.  The support, wisdom and courage of all the people here, past and present, gave me the strength to keep on going. When I was first diagnosed with breast cancer someone said something very profound to me - it was this - 'being diagnosed with cancer is like all of a sudden being in a foreign land and you have to learn a foreign  language'  .  She was absolutely right and although a cancer diagnosis is hugely  frightening and you are walking in uncharted waters,  you WILL find your way through and find the resilience, hope and support to keep on going. I am not the same person that I was, but cancer taught me so much about myself, my resilience and also about what it really means to be human.  More importantly it taught me so much about those extraordinary people who have walked this path and their advice, hope and courage shines through absolutely everything. Gill, please feel free to ask anything you want and if I can help in some small way I would be very happy to do so. With my thoughts to you. Heather x",

      "Content": "Hello Gill Thank you for the correction to the size of your tumour.  When is your appointment with your surgeon regarding what they want to do ?  Ask him/her lots of questions and I would advise you to write these down prior to going so you can be as informed as possible and make your decisions based on this.  Do you have family to go with you? Yes, I cried all the time.  It could be anything, the cancer adverts on television, a sad movie or song, something someone says when they are talking with you and trying to help - or just your own thoughts as you try to process everything that is happening and what may or may not happen in the future.  May I suggest, if possible, that you try to take only one day at a time.  As wise lady on this forum, a while back ,said if you keep looking into the future with great anxiety then  you will  lose the gift of  today. I still cry more than I used to ten months after finishing treatment.  I think there are several reasons for this - the fact that I survived 20 rather gruelling months and that I found a resilience in me that I had no idea was there.  My mammogram in June was good in that they said 'no cause for concern'.  I have a wonderful surgeon, skilled, funny and with a warmth that he radiates - on top of that he is good looking:) LOL My experience of this difficult road  has taught me so much, so, yes, I still cry more when I recall many things and when I recall the amazing  people on this forum.  They taught me so much and for this I am very grateful.   Always look at the positive, not the negative, always hope and always laugh - and in my experience, those I love have become the core of what is really significant in my life, even more so than before. They know so much about different breast cancers now and it is that medical science that will treat your tumour and even though the treatment can be very difficult, there will be a day when it will be all over and then they will check you with yearly mammograms and breast checks.  I am in Newcastle upon Tyne and the RVI hospital here  is excellent.  I am due there next Tuesday for another check. Take good care of you and distract with whatever you like to do.  One step at a time...l with love Heather x",

I never cough, or very rarely.  I breathe MUCH easier and walk most days a mile or two without becoming out of breath.  It makes SO MUCH DIFFERENCE.

I am hoping the pathology results are okay, if not, I am not sure how I will emotionally react.  I am so tired and so fed up.  I was fifteen months on letrozole before my operation trying to reduce tumour size.  It was still 3cms when they operated in addition to the further cancer nodule on my breast  seeded by the original biopsy. My surgeon also had to make two incisions in my back for the LD flap for some reason I cannot now remember. I feel very, very low, but I am trying to process this.  For the first time in my life I am not sure I will make it.  The last 13 years have been full of major trauma on and off and I think I am on the edge.  I have an onco clinic psychologist, but nothing is helping and I definitely do not want antidepressants.  For some reason my body seems to be so sensitive to all drugs, I seem to get so many side effects.  I know I have stop going down this dark road and normally I can and change direction.  I am finding it all very difficult now. The good news is that I am having a 'holiday' from letrozole.  Believe me my joints and hot flushes are 70% better.  It is amazing.  However, I am sure my surgeon will want me back on an AI soonish.
