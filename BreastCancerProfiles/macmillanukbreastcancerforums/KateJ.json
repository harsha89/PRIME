      "Content": "Hi PinkSquirrel :) I'm glad you were able to get the R1 and R2 creams. Put the R1 on as soon as you get out of radiotherapy - in the changing room, it gets a bit sticky though so try and let it dry as much as possible before getting dressed. 1 sachet was fine for me. Depending on the time of day my treatment was ... times were all over the place.... if a morning treatment I would put R2 on in the afternoon and then again before bed. If treatment was in the afternoon then just before bed. I used about 4 R2 sachets at a time.. they are tiny and you should have been given two boxes full. Wishing you all the best for the radiotherapy... you can count it down every day ... tick another session off :) Love Kate x",

      "Content": "Hi All, Just to say, I also used R1 and R2 creams. The radiotherapy technician said that by the end of my 15 treatments my skin was as she would expect by session 4 ... just slight redness. She said she wished they'd taken photos before and after as she was so impressed. It was timely as the unit had had a rep in the week before who was showing them the creams so the team were aware of them but hadn't had anyone use them yet. When I took the creams in at my planning session she checked with the oncology consultant who said she was happy for me to use them and to let them know how it went. I didn't use any other creams. I kept using them til they had all gone so about another 5 days after radiotherapy had finished. My GP was happy to prescribe them and gave me 1 box of R1 and 2 boxes of R2 . This got me through the whole 15 sessions. I hope it all goes well for you. Kate x",

Course you would cry, any of us would. Sometimes we keep going.. and keep going... and that's great  ... but it has to come out somewhere ... Pressure cookers - these experiences,being in physical pain, the constant  ever-present worry, the messing abut of your appointment dates you've had recently, it's so hard. It is a huge load to bear up under. You are doing incredibly - you are working a job which you ENJOY, keeping a home, being there for family and friends, giving so much of yourself here to support other women by sharing your experiences and your compassion for others. Did your BCN ask how you are managing generally? When I cried in front of my BCN and we had a chat about things she suggested a referral to the hospital counselling team - specialist cancer service counsellor. I am so grateful she made the referral. It helped enormously by having a 'safe' space to say all the stuff I was struggling with and  she gave me some strategies of things to say in different situations that I was finding difficult. And mostly that , what a shocker, the way I was feeling was 'normal'! Would you feel able to talk to your BCN next Wednesday at your appointment, if you feel it might help you? And of course, keeping talking honestly to us all here. I cried in front of my boss this week... with the wonderful words of toddlers everywhere, \"I'm just sooo tired\". I thought she was going to send me for a 'nap' but no such luck, I had to keep going, but I'm kind of glad she knows that while I am doing my best and loving being back at work, I still feel like I have concrete boots on sometimes when the fatigue kicks in. much love, will be thinking of you next wednesday for your next appointment Kate xx",

      "Content": "Hi Welshie YES !!! I had major pounding headaches tbat started probably about a third of the way through my 15 radiotherapy sessions for breast cancer. I came on here and asked and people didnt seem to have had the same experience. I then did a bit of research on other sites and found enough people saying yes...they had exoerienced deep deep headaches through radiotherapy... to make me feel reassured it must be something that happens to some people during radiotherapy. I convinced myself it was something nasty going on in my brain. It wasnt. My lovely consultant sent me for a brain scan after radiotherapy...she said she knew it wouldnt be anything but she felt I wouldnt enjoy life again til tbey had put my mind at rest. She was very perceptive. Scan all clear. So I put it down to either my neck not liking the tension all round my shoulders as I tried to stay still in the radio machine.... stress coming out from all I had been through with diagnosis and treatment ...toxins being pumped round my body from all that tissue cell death... who knows...? But they headaches did end though it took a couple of weeks after radio finished. But the headaches were bad enough to really concern me at the time. Count down your radio sessions. Try and rest when you can. And drinking lots if water is always good  You will get there. It does get better. Best wishes...Kate xx",

It would be utterly normal that your head would be spinning and fear spiralling but don't make any decisions ... you don't yet know what it is you are facing. Gather and re-group. There will be lots of treatment options and things to help. That possibly doesn't sound appealing going though it all again and I can hear how tired you sound. When courage fails you let others around you give you their courage until your own courage comes back. If your energy flags let others do as much for you as possible. Your son will want his Mum around and you want that too. No giving up. Please stay in touch. Sending you love and thinking of you tonight. I hope you are able to get some sleep. And I will be thinking of you tomorrow for your PET scan. Love Kate xx",

So grateful for this site and our friends here. I need to echo what all these lovely ladies have said ... yes its beyond rubbish, it's so unfair, it really is awful for anyone to be in this situation. Absolutely life is precious, your family and friends will want as much time with you as they can have. I can't imagine any of us would want the money... a car, holiday, bricks, rather than time with our loved ones. My parents are healthy and well and I still tell them to spend their money on them now and enjoy themselves. I want to see them happy and enjoying their time ... I imagine for your family, although you would have given them your hard earned money with love, it would feel hard for them to have it, in their hands, in their bank accounts, when they would rather have had you. They KNOW you love them. They KNOW you would have done this for them if things had been different. Baki, the situation changed, leaving an inheritance is lovely and kind and providing for your family... but you couldn't forsee this happening... your diagnosis and treatment needs. Thank God you worked so hard for that money and you have the opportunity (as much as it sticks in the throat that it's not available for 'free') to have access to the drugs. What a wonderful brother - He loves you so much he wouldn't think twice about giving you such a gift.... material things mean very little when it comes down to it ..  ... but life and time with family and loved ones and experiencing as much of the goodness in this world ... they are free but are also priceless. You are loved. BE loved. Enjoy being loved. That is so precious. Keep going as long as the drugs are working. Who knows what new developments in medicine may be just around the corner? Please please don't give up, don't feel guilty, give them as much time with you as you can - that is your gift to them. That is what you are leaving them. That is what they WANT. You and your family sound wonderful. No more guilt now, please. We can be so hard on ourselves, we wouldn't say the things we say to ourselves to a friend in the same situation. Be gentle and kind to yourself Baki. You are fighting hard and you must be exhausted and reeling from the news about the second lesion. It's no wonder you mind is muddled and your thoughts spinning. Let some time pass. much love and another hug to add to all your hugs from your friends here. Kate xxx",

      "Content": "Hi Scotland, Just read your post and wanted to reply. We sound like we are on a similar path but I am a bit ahead of you so hopefully I can help. I was diagnosed in June 2015 stage 3 HER2 positive. I had Fec -T chemotherapy and started Herceptin before surgery. I then had left sided mastectomy without reconstruction and full axilla node clearance. I have just completed 15 sessions of radiotherapy and remain on Herceptin. I had my Herceptin given by injection into my thigh. There are 18 doses in all given at 3 weekly intervals so about a year-ish. The first dose is given at the time of your first T cycle of chemotherapy. That was chemo number 4 out of 6 for me. They do monitor you in the unit for about an hour the first time just to check you don't have  a reaction. The second injection (at the time of chemo no 5 ) they monitor you for half an hour... and so it decreases. Now I just go into the unit once every 3 weeks, have my injection and leave straight away. All good. You will have to have regular heart scans (echo-cardiograms) while on Herceptin, this is all normal care and your unit arrange it for you. Herceptin doesn't affect your hair so it will grow back even though you are on Herceptin - just thought I'd mention that as I sit here with my weirdly curly tufts growing in :) You asked about a PICC line. For me it was a really positive thing to do. I was anxious about having one initially but oh my goodness it made everything so much easier. No looking for veins or anything when being given chemo and all my blood tests the blood is taken through the PICC line and you don't feel it at all. I soon got used to having it in my arm and that really surprised me. It didn't affect my sleeping or anything and when you are wearing long sleeves its discreet (just be careful about people given you those super encouraging arm rubs!!). I had it cleaned and flushed out every week at my local unit in town so I didn't have to go to the main hospital each week. You might be able to have it done at your GP's - do ask. The PICC line was great for me, I didn't have any trouble with it, though not everyone will have been the same I appreciate. And now it feels like a distant memory. I was given a choice at the hospital but strongly advised to have the PICC line as apparently with FEC-T there can be risks if it gets into your skin while being given through the vein. It took about half an hour to be put in and was done on the unit. It's a bit surreal but I just watched on the camera screen to see the tube going in. They then send you for an x-ray to check the PICC line is in a good place. It inserts at the top of your arm and runs internally through a vein to near your heart. But once it's in you shouldn't really feel it there. Also, like you, I haven't had immediate reconstruction. This was because they knew from the initial plan that I would be having radiotherapy. I think my consultant said she would discuss it in a year or so but to be honest I have chosen not to have reconstruction. Personal decision but the silicon prosthetic boob inserts are amazing. These were assessed for and given to me at the breast care unit. They even gave me a partial insert for my right breast to match up. Honestly I have never looked so pert!!! :) I'm 44 and quite small-breasted anyway so that may have helped for me in terms of adjusting to the bra inserts. I was worried initially that people would be able to tell, or would flick a look at my boob but you really can't tell - with your clothes on!! As all the lovely ladies on here will say DO do your exercises post surgery and just carry on ... I've done all through radiotherapy and have just carried on. It is so daunting at the beginning and it all happens so quickly, you are just thrown into this process, and once bit of treatment is done you are into the next. It is tiring and draining I can't deny, and emotionally it's tough and scarey it but you will be getting the best care. Look after yourself, let others help as much as possible (and don't feel bad about that)... you will get through. Be kind to yourself - this is hard but you can and will do it and come out the other side. Much love,wishing you all the best Kate xx",

      "Content": "Hi Invisible me, Here's a confession .. when I read your post I was almost too nervous to look. Feared the replies. I'm HER2 as well. I'm 44. Like you, the breast cancer treatment I'm having now I  knew I could get through, but it's the recurrence fear that just  terrifies me. I had chemotherapy FEC-T, then left mastectomy and I finished radiotherapy last week. Today I had Herceptin injection number 9. I am very grateful to be having those. I wouldn't want any one to have any type of breast cancer at all.  But this is the type I have, I have no control over that and if I had another type I'd worry about that too.  But I was encouraged to read DreamThief's response. And thank you Julia too. I'm having counselling at the hospital and its really helping. I find it helpful just to have a place I can say my fears about recurrence out loud. When your fear is recurrence, (and I expect it is for many) it's hard when life is supposedly going back to 'normal', work etc and everyone says,\" well done.\" How do you explain that it's the worry for the future that's harder than the current treatment in some ways? Everyone is so pleased you are 'through' your treatment it feels like a dampener to mention fears of recurrence. So, I'm trying not to do that. The counselling is helping to have a place that I can do that safely and then enjoy life and \"being through treatment (nearly)\" elsewhere. Because getting through it is a huge achievement.  I hope that you could consider some counselling help. It's been really positive for me. I'm also doing a Moving Forward course in May. I'm looking after my general health and well-being too, changed my diet and am hoping to try yoga or something to help with relaxation. I'm not googling either... don't want to see anything  that I may then dwell on. I know I'm getting the best treatment I can for HER2 and doing all I can to keep healthy and happy. Life is good. And we all have wonderful support from the people on here who understand our fears and worries. Sending you love and positive thoughts. Kate xx",
