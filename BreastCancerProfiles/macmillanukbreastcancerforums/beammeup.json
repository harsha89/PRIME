    "Content": "Hi everyone, I only have experience of the NHS but they have been fabulous. I went to my GP with a lump and was refered there and then to Breast clinic who saw me the following week. I had a mammogram, ultrasound and biopsies all on the same day. I did have to wait 10 days for my results but then I was booked for lumpectomy for the following week. I then had to wait 10 days for my results again and thankfully had clear margins but SLNB was positive and have to have ANC. At each appointment I have only seen a consultant and BCN is always there and she usually goes over everything the consultant has told to make sure I have understood the information and answer any questions. She then make arrangements for a home visit (usually a week later) to go over things again and show any photos or any drains I might come home with. I have had some seroma that needed to be drained so spoke with BCN who told me to come to the ward where it was drained and off I went again. I can't praise the service I have recieved enough. During me hospital stay the staff were great and made tea all night and listened to my fears and moans and nothing was too much trouble. I think there are good and bad in both systems but support network is better in the NHS as the (IMHO) BCN been there every step of the way and if she doesn't know the answer then she always gets back to me. However, I have also had brilliant support from here and Breastcancercare. Well done and keep up the good work.",
