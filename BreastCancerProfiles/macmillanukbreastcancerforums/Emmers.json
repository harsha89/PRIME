      "Content": "Thanks Rebecca. I have strattice biomesh with silicone implants. Ive had double masectomy but thankfully only need radiotherapy on my left side - so possibility I could have similar problem to you, with one breast sitting a bit differently to the other. Good that your surgeon can adjust your implant. Amazing what they can do these days!Â  Emmers",
