    "Content": "Hi everyone, first post here.  My BCN recommended Ibuleve for the pain and it did make some difference.  Jenny and Celia, as Chris999 suggests I'd ask about a port or a line if you still have chemo treatments to go.  It became pretty hard to find a vein from which to take blood samples from my arm, even though only two chemo treatments went in through my hand and wrist.  Where I am, only the oncology department wanted to use the port for taking blood samples for testing - someone said this was because the blood would be contaminated by the chemo - and as I've had lymph nodes removed neither I nor they want to use the other side.  Also, I had scans with contrast/radioactive stuff pre radiotherapy and each time they wanted to pump that in through my hand. Good luck, everyone.   Sue xxx",
