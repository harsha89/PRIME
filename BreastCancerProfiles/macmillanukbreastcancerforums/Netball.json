      "Content": "ronstar Hi Netball I did buy a load of finger plasters but gave up on them and switched to cutting up a non-adherent dressing pad to cover the nail bit then wrapping with micropore. I also bought some little things called finger cots (ebay, I think) - they are like little condoms for your fingers Then you can just cover the fingers that you need to when you're doing wet work e.g shower, washing Â hair etc Hope you find a solution! R Thanks. Ordered from eBay this morning",
