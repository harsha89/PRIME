    "Content": "Hi, I've just been diagnosed with Grade 2 invasive ductal breast cancer which has spread to my lymph nodes.  (3/4 tumours biggest one 7cms) 1/3 lymph nodes and mestatisis(sp?) in my blood.  I've just had a contrast dyecat scan to see if its spread further (They wanted to do an mri but im extremely clasutrophobic). I get the results on Thurs.  I also have Leiden Factor V (both cells) I've had 36 dvts, 3 PEs and a brain clot and I'm disabetic, have severe IBS as a result of 20yrs of sub cut heparin which also affects your bone density (osteparosis) and fibromyagliga.  (If i was a horse they'd shoot me!). I'm the youngest of 6 kids (I turned 54 yesterday), my mum died age 53 from cancer.  All three of my sisters and one of my brothers has had/have cancer and my oldest sister and best friend died last yr.  She had breast cancer but that isnt what killed her.  I have a 24 yr old daughter who is studying in the states for the last 3yrs and cant afford to fly to see her in Texas so a bit gutted about that. Anyway I'm trying to remain positive and upbeat but im finding it really hard.  Infront of everyone else I'm all \"I got this, bothered? nah I'll kick its arse\" etc but in private alone at night with my sister gone, my daughter in texas and feeling weak I cant stop crying. I dont want to be reliant on sleeping tablets but without them im not getting a wink of sleep... so i wondered how every one else copes who might be alone as well?  thank you for reading xxxxx",
