      "Content": "Hi Annie, my aches & pains kicked in on day 4 - Monday, got worse on Tuesday and were almost gone by Friday. I found my first Tax was the worst. I only used strong painkillers on the Tuesday, ibuprofen on the Monday & Wednesday & nothing on the Thurs and Fri. Top tip is to use painkillers as soon as you feel any pain at all as it will only get worse so nip itin the bud as soon as it starts. Other tip, drink loads of water. If you get a white coating on your tongue, that's oral thrush. Get Nyastatin from your GP if you notice it. GP told me pineapple juice can can rid of thrush too so get some of that in just in case. I had Del Monte pineapple ice lollies which were great as they soothed my mouth & I could actually taste them :) My honest blog post about tax is on my blog (link below) entry called Tax Truck.

      "Content": "Hi All, I'm 28 and newly diagnosed (22/06/12) with mixed types (Invasive Ductal & Invasive Lobular) BC. I am still completely in shock at the moment and learning how to process this. I'm currently feeling sad, scared, overwhelmed and angry all at the same time. Last Sunday I was scheduled to do Race for Life which is a 5km and as I had booked to do it months before any of this even happened I was determined to go ahead and do it still. I ran it and I raised £860 so I am really pleased that I challenged myself and completed that hurdle. I've found out that I'll be having FEC-T chemo (6 sessions every 3 weeks), surgery and then radiotheraphy follwed by 5 years on Temoxifen. I'm worried sick about the side effects of the chemo, the prognosis and so many other things. I'm due to be getting married in April 2013 and I am terrified I won't be able to one minute and then the next minute I'm using that as my determination focus. I have no idea how to \"be\" at the moment and keep being sick because I work myself up so much. I'm sorry if this is rambling and doesn't make sense but I think I am just totally overwhelmed by everything. I am usually such a self-controlled, organised person, I think the fact that this is so not under my control is also one of the things that is working me up the most. I am very lucky to have a fantastic partner, family and friends who have all already started rallying around me. If anyone can offer some advice as to how to deal with these initial feelings I'd be really grateful xx",

I am going to see the chemo nurses tomorrow (as the T is at a new hospital to where I had the FEC) so I wanted to know if there was anything I should be asking them. I have already bought myself pineapple ice lollies and frozen fresh pineapple sticks, some dark nail polish (I will paint them tomorrow), some nail strengthener and some cotton gloves to wear at night once I've slathered on the moisturiser.   My onc told me I would be having the jabs for 5 days after the T (blimmin scared of giving these to myself but it's better than having neutropenia I guess).   I'm so scared of all the T side effects, I did okay-ish on FEC, being constipated, having awful heartburn/indigestion, feeling nauseous & my veins hardening were the main SEs I had from FEC. Are the main ones on T losing nails, losing eyelashes & eyebrows (I still have a little bit of head hair left over despite not doing cold cap & I think my eyebrows have thinned), joint pain, drying skin & everything tasting like cardboard?   Any little (or large!) tips anyone can give me to help me deal with the Tax Truck would be really really appreciated.   Thank you from (a very frightened) Jelly xx",

I haven't seen him since chemo #2 though which worries me itself as surely they should be monitoring me throughout this while process :( After surgery I have rads which again I know nothing about other than what you've all posted on here. The other day I found a really sad blog about a girl who was the same age as me (29) & she passed away 2 weeks before she was due to get married. I know she's not me but ever since I've just had dark, low thoughts & can't seem to pick myself up.

They're great as I can keep 1 in my handbag, 1 in my work drawer, in my car etc etc without having to carry round a big bottle of solution. When I need one I just snap the top off and use it, each one has about 10 drops worth of liquid in. The fact that they're individual phials reduces contamination and saline deposit residue too.

      "Content": "Hi Judi, I found Difflam mouthwash really helped me. On the T part of my chemo, one of the nastiest side effects was that the inside of my mouth was really sore & peeled. It was truly horrible and made me feel sick as I constantly felt like there were bits of skin in my throat. I mentioned this to my chemo nurses who suggested Difflam. It works by reducing inflammation and also acts as a local anaesthetic, causing numbness and so pain relief. When my mouth peeled, I had a yucky flabby tongue and everything tasted of cardboard; the thing I found that helped more than anything was Del Monte pineapple ice lollies. Ice lollies are great because they help soothe sore mouths, and also pineapple is a natural cure for oral thrush (which I kept getting on T) so you\u2019re getting two benefits with the one lolly. Definitely stock up on these! X",
