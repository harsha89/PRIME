      "Content": "Hi Laura I have been pretty lucky with the side effects - I had a few  aches and pains when i first started taking them but found exercise helped with that - get some hot moments but nothing too bad. Recovery from op again not too bad had the operation on a Tuesday and was back at work on the Monday after  but just did half days that week. I work about 5 mins from my house so didn't have to contend with long journeys .My job does involve sitting down - was good to get out of the house :-) I would say it was uncomfortable rather than sore - strange burning/stabbing  sensations from the nerves healing  !!!  I got the results of the lumpectomy clean margins and the lymph nodes 10 days after my operation . I was grade 2- I was borderline for needing chemo so now waiting for results from Oncotype test if it comes back low I won't need chemo just Radiotherapy - Radiotherapy seems to be pretty standard if you have a lumpectomy.  Hope that helps",

      "Content": "Hi Laura I was diagnosed with Lobular in october - mine was not staged as they don't do that at my hospital. My tumour was 5 cm on ultrasound but I had  a MRI to check this as lobular can be sneaky!!! It was also to check the other breast and the nodes -  MRI came back with same 5 cm results and the rest clear/ I was ER+ and due to size of tumour it was decided that I would get hormone tablets and monthly injection to shrink the tumour prior to an operation. The injection was Zoladex because I was pre menopause and this stops your ovaries producing Oestrogen - letrozole tablets to stop the rest of my body producing oestrogen. I was then scanned(ultrasound) after 6 weeks to see if this worked which it had . I then had a lumpectomy end of Feb - now waiting on oncotype test to see if I need Chemo or not. When I had my lumpectomy I also had a sentinel node biopsy -  Kay",

      "Content": "Hi Laura Hope your mum will get her results soon as it's all much easier to deal with when you know exactly what you are dealing with! It all seems very confusing at the start but like a jigsaw the pieces suddenly seem to fit together and you can see the big picture .  I managed a trip to New York just after I was diagnosed and it was good to have that to focus on so got my fingers crossed it will be the same for your mum The tablets I take would probably be the same as the ones that your mum would get if she was er+ as the injections basically are a chemical menopause .  Let me know how your mum gets on after all her tests will have my fingers crossed that your holiday can go ahead as planned  Kay ",

      "Content": "Hi Daisylou  I had the oncotype test recently it took about 3 weeks I think to get back. The way i looked at it was the original %s were based on averages of patients  with similar diagnosis but the oncotype actually tests your tumour so it is only based on your data. i then felt that if I wasn't doing chemo ( which I haven't) at least I knew that it was based on my tumour and it's characteristics rather than an average . Hope that makes sense. Mine came back at 14 and when I saw the test results there was no benefit of chemo for me . Obviously the test is not infallible but it is a lot more personal and specific than the original % that they give you or at least that s the way that I looked at it.",
