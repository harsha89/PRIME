    "Content": "Hello sugartc  i have been prescribed the dexomethesone (steroid), ondanastron and domperidone all together for first three days after the chemo then domperdione on its own for another  two days. Have not had any trouble at all with nausea. Yes my taste buds change and I feel as I have felt in my mouth but it passes once I stop the steroid. Completed my second EC  treatment today. It\u2019s rather a bunmpy ride for a week and a half but once the injections finish everything lifts for me.  This is the biggest health challenge I have ever faced. Stay strong and maybe your oncologist could look at a better nausea drug combo for you. ",
