      "Content": "I had my results today after WLE and SNB. Lump removed and margins were clear but tiny amount of cancer showed up in lymph node. I could have lymph node clearance or radiotherapy but no idea of treatment plan yet.  I have to wait for an appointment with the oncologist regarding radiotherapy, chemotherapy and hormone therapy.  ",

      "Content": "Hi Sarah I had my 6th (and final) FEC-T on 21 May.  The first three FEC weren't too bad apart from being tired, aching for a few days when on nivestim and needing two units of blood.  The T part was harder for me.  The first was ok but after the second I had nausea for the first time and one day when I stayed in bed.  There were problems getting the cannula inserted and I bruised badly and I had to wait for the faulty pump to get changed on the drip.  The last session went smoothly but I had nausea again which was made worse because I had my planning scan for radiotherapy the day after.  I am feeling better now and ready to move on to radiotherapy on 11th June.  Glad to be the other side now but it wasn't as awful as I expected. Good luck with your journey.  Be strong xx Canterbury",
