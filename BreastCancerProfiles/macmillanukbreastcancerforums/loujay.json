      "Content": "Thanks for the advice Dorothee. I'll give my GP a call. Although your point about the make of Tamoxifen changing could well be very valid, as I've noticed that my new prescription is in fact from another manufacturer, thinking back, I suffered with really bad hot flushes about a month or so too (I hadn't had any hot flushes for months), could be just one of those other joys of taking this little pill or relating to the different manufacturer.....or it could just be all down to me, who knows :-) I'll give my GP a call and see what he says. Many thanks, wishing you all the best. Lou x",

      "Content": "Thanks mistymoley....I had my last child 5 years ago now, so doubt it will be anything to do with pregnancy :-). I did however chat with my GP yesterday, he said the cause is due to Tamoxifen lowering the Oestrogen levels in my body which is why my hair is thinning. I asked if there was anything I could take ie extra vitamins etc, but he said that providing I'm eating a balanced diet, then they wouldn't make a difference. All in all there is nothing that can be done :-(.",

      "Content": "Hi all, I'm new to this site, so just a little background.... I was diagnosed with breast cancer in Dec 2008 whilst pregnant with my 2nd child, had a lumpectomy and node removal the following Jan, gave birth in the May then started chemo 2 weeks after and a double mastectomy in 2010. I've been taking Tamoxifen for the last 4 years with minimal side effects, however over the last 3 months or so I've noticed increased hair loss. I know this is one of the side effects listed but just wanted to know if anyone else has experienced it and whether there is anything that can be done to prevent it getting worse. I'm 39 btw.",
