      "Content": "Hi all   Last Wednesday I went to see the Breast Cancer Nurse to discuss my family history as my mum has had breast cancer and my aunt has just been diagnosed with it for the second time!   After the chat the nurse said to pop round to xray to see if they could fit me in for a mamogram (as I am 40 and due to history they will now monitor me till I am 49).   I had the 4 xrays then the nurse popped out of the room as she said that she wanted to check that they have come out ok, when she came back she said that she needed to take another xray of a particular area of my right breast once she had done this she said that I now needed to go round to Ultra Sound.   They carried out the Ultra Sound then they said they had to do a Core Biopsy, at this point I really didn't have a clue what was going on as I was only meant to be having a chat with the Breast Cancer Nurse and a possible mammogram.   Afterwards I was sent home and told that I would know results in a couple of weeks.   I am very anxious and wondered if this was normal at how quickly I went from a mammogram to a core biopsy??   Is it normal to wait a couple of weeks for results whether its good or bad news?   Also I am experiencing pain in my breast still, is this normal too?   If anybody would be so kind to confirm that this is normal procedure?   Thank you in advance   Fleur xx",
