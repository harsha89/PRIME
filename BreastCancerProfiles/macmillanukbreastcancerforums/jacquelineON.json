      "Content": "My bcn is fabulous and the ladies she works with are as well, I get phone calls regularly and she knows exactly what is going on with me, today she came and found me to sort out my sick note as I was supposed to go and see her but I was ages on the ward so she came to find me. After reading everyone else's post I sound a bit smug but I really cannot sing the praises enough. Not sure if it is because I am under Rotherham which is a subsidiary of weston Park hospital in Sheffield and they are such a small unit but you would think they would all work similarly but I assume Ali owl is under weston Park as she is a Sheffield girl and her posting would suggest otherwise. Sorry you guys that aren't getting the support they should be getting, suggest you all move to Rotherham although we haven't particularly got a good reputation as a town at the moment ",

It is natural to want to protect your family and pushing them away is probably the most logical thing you can do but in reality, they love you and pushing them away will only make them feel worse so you aren't really protecting them and actually you cannot really protect them because this journey is necessary to get to the other side. I cannot say that I know how you are feeling, but I can tell you that you shouldn't have any reason to feel embarrassed, you didn't ask for this did you? Sending you a big hug, I do think that you need to \"vent your spleen\" and here is the perfect way to do it. Be safe x ",

I didn't do cold cap either, it really is whatever you feel best with, losing your hair isn't the end of the world, and there are bonuses (saving on hair products, less time in the shower, don't need to use an extra towel to dry your head). Good luck tomorrow, you will be fine xxx you also might want to try breathing techniques when you got to bed, this should help you relax and concentrate your mind on your breathing rather than tomorrow, deep breath in then twice as long to breath out (if that makes Sense)",

      "Content": "You poor love, what a lot you are having to deal with all at once, I wish there were word's that a could say that will alleviate your worry, all I can say is that you are being proactive in dealing with whatever this is by speaking to your bcn and I am sure they will get you checked as soon as possible. With regards to your recent bereavement the loss of a parent whatever age they are or you are are is devastating you are suddenly thrown into a zone of not having that reassurance of the comfort of a parent, even if that caring responsibly has been reversed for years. The grieving process is necessary for your emotional and ultimately physical self to move forward.  I am no expert but have lost both parents and I can only speak from experience. There are fabulous people on here that will and can help and I will try and help as much as I can. This forum will show you that you don't have to go through this alone x ",

Glad to see we are sharing the pain ladies xx ",
