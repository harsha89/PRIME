      "Content": "hi there im currently on my third night in hospital in an isolation room with neutropenic sepsis due to chemo (docetaxel) . I am actually feeling a lot better and hopefully will allowed home tomorrow but really struggling to sleep and feeling very lonely. My partner is away travelling so my 3-year old is without either of his parents which I feel terrible about. I am on round 6/8, I was in hospital after #5 too with the same issue so I am wondering if this will be the case for the last two rounds as well. Overall I'm very positive and can see that the end of treatment is in sight but right now I'm feeling pretty miserable and lonely.  anyone in a similar position, or perhaps was and has a story to share? x",

      "Content": "Hi there I had my first of four EC cycles 18 days ago. My hair started to shed on day 14, not huge clumps or anything but definitely quite a bit coming out every time I run hands through it. Just wondered how long it took for hair to fall out for others - does it happen over a few days or take several weeks? I have a wig ready but just wanted to know what to expect! I had the cold cap last time; might persevere for one more session (on Wed) and see if it does any good. Will be moving onto 4 x Docetaxel with Herceptin and Pertuzumab after this lot. thanks for any advice x",

      "Content": "Best of luck happy mum - as somebody else said, i found the anticipation much worse than the actual treatment. I've had two full rounds of EC (another today which went fine) and it does knock you about a bit but I am managing to work still so I hope you will too. I have treatment on Wednesdays, and take the thur, fri and Monday off (I have tried working on the monday but my brain is pretty slow so it's pretty frustrating!). Then I do tues and wed at home if I can, then I'm out and about full-time from then on until the next one.   Will cross fingers for you x",

Feeling pretty anxious about it as I'm finally feeling more human after dose #1... re cold-cap, I had to wear it for 4 bloody unpleasant hours. But- I've still got my hair today (fingers crossed that stays!) . I took 2 paracetamol beforehand, which did nothing. However I asked if I could take codiene this time and was told it was fine (no interaction with the TC chemo). Will report back if that helps at all! good luck everyone Good luck today heather! X",
