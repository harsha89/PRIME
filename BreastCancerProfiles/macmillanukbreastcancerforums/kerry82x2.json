    "Content": "Hi, I am brand new to this site and wondered if there was anyone with information on the best way to go about treating secondary breast cancer in the bone. My mum (53) was diagnosed with stage 3 breast cancer with nodal involvement about 10 months ago. She has had a mastectomy, 8 cycles of chemo and 6 weeks of radiotherapy and put on tamoxifen. She has now been diagnosed with secondaries in her spine (although there seem to be none present in any other organs) so her oncologist has switched her to letrozole (femara), 1 week of radio for the 'big' bit of cancer in her spine (and doesn't seem to be worried about treating the small bits) and a monthly infusion of biphosphonates (zometa). Her oncologist doesn't seem to think chemo is neccessary at the moment unless it spreads further, although I can't work out why they don't give her this before it does? If anyone has any information on this type of situation I would be very grateful. I am very angry at everything right now and hope this website may give some hope. Kerry x",
