    "Content": "Hi everyone, I've just joined this group today and looking for some advice. I was diagnosed with Stage 2 breast cancer.   Had the op 4 weeks ago. It was a success in that all the margins were clear around lump and lymph node.  three other lymph nodes removed which  were clear of cancer.  HER2 test was negative.   I have now been given the option to have Chemotherapy and radiotherapy or just the radiotherapy.    The thing is I did not expect to be told it was my decision to have chemo or not.   They said it was a low risk of 5% in 100 of cancer coming back.  Now I don't know what to do.  Has anyone else had to make this decision.  I know it's up to me in the end but my head is spinning.   Thanks..",
