Each time we get an ache or pain we automatically feel its the big C returned but it isent always the case. My poor niece who had breast cancer nearly 5 years ago recently had a lump under her arm were they removed lymph glands and it turned out to be an infected hair follicle , not that I am minimising your worries or lump but please don't live in fear all the time. As I said the other day take one step at a time and deal with each day  because if we look forward all the time our mind decides its all doom and gloom at times. Deal with today and then start again tomorrow with another day Wish I could be there to give you a big hug and be a shoulder to cry on because we all try to be brave in front of family, but they do know how anxious you will feel so don't feel you have to keep it all to yourself. You have my phone number so give me a call and talk it through anytime, love and hugs Pat xxxx.",

Now my doctor says my blood tests show raised liver function levels. She said they should be between 20 and 40 and mine is over 50. I don't drink any alcohol at all and wondered if anyone else has had raised levels. Hope I don't sound silly but anything out of the ordinary with tests makes me worry the big \"C\" has returned elsewhere.

      "Content": "Hi chloecat45. Thanks for your reply. I don't really know exactly what is wrong regarding the high levels, she just said it was higher than it should be at over 50 when normal levels are between 20 and 40. I think sometimes when they say there is a problem you get scared to ask in case they tell you something you don't want to hear but have calmed down now and don't feel quite as stressed. I haven't changed my medications for a long while now , been pretty constant, just diabetic, cholesterol and iron and thyroxine . So don't really know exactly what is high as you have said there is more than one enzyme in the body so it could be any of them. I don't drink any alcohol so I guess being quite ignorant of blood results you start worrying what it can be but have decided to wait until I get my next results in six weeks as if it is still high then I will have an ultra sound scan which might tell me more. Keep fighting, whatever crops up we will manage it wont we. xxxx love and hugs Pat xxx",

I too was referred to the breast clinic for symptoms other than a lump. Mine was because my breasts were sore, no lump ,so thought I was just wasting every ones time. Went through similar to yourself, mammogram which showed micro calcifications,(which I must admit didn't know what they were) then core biopsies, Cannot say weither your results will say it is cancer, lets hope not.  Mine was unfortunately, in one way unfortunately but on the other hand because there wasn't a lump present it was caught early which only meant a lumpectomy, Hope that you get good results too but the fact that they have found anything before you had any lumps or bumps sounds like if you have got anything it has been caught early. No one can make the time pass quickly until the 28th , its just something we have to do, waiting. Try not to worry too much (not easy I know) But panicing really doesn't help , it makes you feel worse. Try to think of things you want to ask the doctor and if poss write them down then you wont go home thinking \" I wish I had asked him that\" Good luck with your results, take care, Hoping for the best for you, love and hugs Pat xxx",

Don't think I have really reacted to all the trauma of biopsies and diagnosis, operations and forthcoming radiotherapy. But guess the shakiness is my body telling me to \"wow, slow down you've been through a lot, be kind to yourself....\" I too have a friend who doesn't seem to get the seriousness of cancer as when I told her my initial diagnosis all she said was OH, Its obvious some people think and feel differently and yes because we all look ok outwardly people don't understand we could be falling apart inside. Keep cheerful, don't think your sister means to be cruel but she could be handling it badly because she is so upset, we cannot know what she feels inside. Keep friendly with her and hopefully she will eventually get the message. love and hugs , hope everyone is having a great holiday, xxxx",

To cut a long story short, had mammogram, then spot mammogram and then an ultrasound scan and they told me I had calcifications and today have had a biopsy to see if it is cancerous. I will get the results next week but had always had routine mammograms and felt for lumps and bumps between exams. Hadent heard of calcifications and wonder if anyone else has had similar problems.

      "Content": "Thanks TraceyBB I had originally gone to the doctors with \"bloating\"issues and am having tests for Ovarian cancer as well as having discovered the calcifications. Unfortunately like most people, I came home and trawled the internet who did say calcifications can be harmless. Under such circumstances its usually a case of continuing with mammograms etc. When I went to the breast clinic they were very thorough and said I had calcifications in the right breast which hadent changed. But  (the big BUT) in the left breast there were issues. And as said trawling the internet found that such changes can be pre cancerous and can be dealt with in a similar way to breast lumps i.e. Mastectomies .Don't want to scare any one as each person is told differently. Obviously am hoping that I fall into the harmless group but get the overall impression from the doctors is Be prepared, so am trying to Be prepared but as said totally bewildered as now found out that the mammograms that I have had done in the past did show calcifications but I was told the breast screenings were clear. Just wish they would be more open so you can at least Be Prepared. Trying to keep a sense of humour, as whatever we all have got wont go away just because we would rather not have it. So take care, thanks for the message, keep in touch. Hope you are weathering the storms too. xxxx Pat@65",

I was told that if they didn't do this you would have a more pronounced lump so please don't worry too much. Speak to your breast cancer nurse and hopefully she can reassure you or refer you back to the surgeon who did your op who will also be able to reassure you. As they make sure you have clear margins from your lump so it sounds more like fatty tissue. love and hugs, hope everything goes ok. Have a lovely Christmas love always Pat xxxx",

      "Content": "Sorry to hear you have found yourself in such a frightening position at 36. It is such a young age and I am sure you are rightly \"panicked and feeling desperate\" I have a young Niece who was diagnosed nearly 5 years ago. She had had a lump for quite some time and was a very shy person and didn't contact her Doctor until she was \"really frightened\". I am happy to say that although her cancer was stage 4 she is now well and is happily continuing with her life. She is now 42 so would be a similar age to you when diagnosed. If you have any questions I am sure the nurses and doctors will be only too happy to talk things through with you. Don't be afraid of being afraid. You must be kind to yourself and realise it is scary but there is definitely light at the end of the tunnel and I am sure once you start your treatment you will regain that positive outlook. Let me know how you are going on. Good luck with your next appointment.                          Wishing you all the best Pat@65",
