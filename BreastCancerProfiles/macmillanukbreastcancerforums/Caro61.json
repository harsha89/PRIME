      "Content": "Hello Anonymous49, I echo the wise words of the lovely Leolady56.  I lost my mum just after my first chemo dose and it is bloody tough and still very raw. My one regret is that she knew I had cancer. Have you thought about counselling through  Macmillan? They do offer a great service and it may help get through this tough period. Do keep strong and please keep posting. Sending you a BIG virtual hug. Carolyn x",

      "Content": "Hello, It's so tough having to make such horrible decisions. My heart goes out to you . I am grade 3 with 1 sentinel node affected. My Surgeon gave me the option of axillary node clearance or going on a trial - I was offered the Posnoc trial which randomises whether  you have an axillary clearance of not. I mulled it over for several days and researched as much as I could about the trial (leaving Mr Google alone) as well as bending the ear of my breast care nurse.  In the end because my tumour was aggressive and because I was so anxious about not knowing whether other nodes were involved I decided to go for full axillary clearance for peace of mind.All remainder of nodes were thankfully clear. That was in Jan this year and to date I have had a good recovery ,no lymphodaema ( the exercises  help) and no regrets.  Radiotherapy was never on the cards for me but I would strongly recommend having a chat with your Breast Care Nurse to talk through the options. It's a very personal decision but for me the right decision. Good luck  CarolynX",

      "Content": "Good news Anonymous49 that you managed to see your Surgeon. I was offered a randomised trial but this trial did not involve radiotherapy as I was already told I needed chemo. I opted for the ANC mainly because I wanted to be sure the remainder of nodes were clear for peace of mind. I'm not sure if my decision would be different if I was offered radiotherapy but in all honesty probably not. It is a personal choice and I would read as much as I can about the trial ( keep clear of Mr Google) so that you can make an informed decision. Keep posting and good luck Hugs Carolyn X",

      "Content": "Hello, My ANC was done as a day case. It did feel 'tight' and bruised for some time but the exercises really help. I did have a drain for about 4 days and managed with paracetamol for discomfort. I am now 4 months down the line and have full movement. The BCN referred me to the lymphodaema nurse as I was concerned over the risk of lymphodaema but she did all the measurements which were fine. The one thing that was emphasised was making sure I keep the arm moisturised and not to lift anything with it for several weeks - I am still very careful. I also have a sleeve for travelling.  All in all it I found it manageable  Good luck Carolyn X",

      "Content": "Hello, I do so emphasise, it is a decision that none of us make likely but having an ANC was definitely the right decision for me but it was a decision not taken lightly but I needed peace of mind of knowing state of play of my lymph nodes. The op was quite straight forward but as mentioned before the exercises are so important. This period is particularly hard and at times dark - everything plays out in your mind and I remember just walking around in a total daze. It's the fear of the unknown but I found once I had the results and then a next stage plan I started to feel more positive and gradually felt I was taking back control. Life does get better and today I finished chemo and now planning a family break, something I couldn't even contemplate at the beginning. Please speak to your BCN they are incredibly supportive and also Chevin out the counselling facilities.  Please keep posting the ladies and gents here are incredibly supportive. Take care Sending gentle hugs Carolyn XX",

      "Content": "Hi JennyB2468, My ALT and ALP were raised during part of my chemo - put down to chemo and antibiotics. The best way to keep the liver healthy is as SJ has mentioned but I would also add green leafy vegetables ( Im a bit of a curly kale fan) plus oily fish.Vitamin C is important for liver function but keep clear of too much red meat.  Manukka honey is great but expensive if buying the one from Holland and Barrett that comes from NZ. I don't particularly like honey so I mix it in with yoghurt and fruit. Good bowel function is also important in getting rid of the toxins in the liver so a good fibre diet will help ( back to the green leafy veg). My BCN said that every day a blood test could be different because of the pounding the liver is taking with all these chemicals so please don't worry too much.My tests incidentally are all back to normal since chemo finished. Best of luck and hugs  Carolyn x",

Again they don't think it is anything to worry about but want to repeat the scan in 6 months. I'm sitting at my office desk also thinking the worst. It's such a horrid position. I guess the positive is they at least keep a close eye on us all and the scans are now so detailed they will highlight everything. Hopefully, we will both be ok and can get our lives back on track.

      "Content": "Hello everyone, This is my first post but I have been following this wonderful website since diagnosis on Nov. Thank you for keeping me sane! In brief, I have had a mastectomy and lymph node clearance have grade 3, 1 positive sentinel node. I have started FEC-T chemo and although sailed through the FEC have had probs with the Doxetexal. 6 days post dose I ended up in hospital with a pyrexia and a neutrophil count of 0.1.Was given IV antibiotics and sent home with 1 weeks supply of  augmentin (May 3rd). Hospital phoned that night to say my ALT liver enzyme was raised and to have repeat bloods in one week ( 10th May). Today I saw the Oncologist prior to my next chemo and was told my ALT had come back down but my ASP was now raised ( had been normal up to now). The first thing that came into my mind was the possibility of liver secondaries. I would have thought if drug related the ALT would still be raised. Oncologist gave me a 3/10 for likelihood of secondaries. I am now worrying myself stupid. Greatful for any help and reassurance  Thank you Carolyn X",
