      "Content": "Yours & Helen's comments have really help Thank You x They are not able to save either nipple due to the tissue they are removing from left side and to bring the right in line with the left my surgeon said he would need to remove the right nipple as well. I know they will be a lot smaller than my current 36DD but to be honest I'm not that bothered as my boobs aren't my greatest asset but I definitely want to keep some sort of feminine look. My surgeon is not putting the implant under the chest muscle but on top so I may get some rippling but he said that he would be able to move some fat from somewhere else on my body on top of the implant to mask this but I guess this will be at a later date. Another thing is I'm drinking plenty of wine at the moment is that normal : )",

      "Content": "Hi There, I'm new today and read this trail of messages, I have a 9cm High Risk DCIS which I have been advised needs to be removed with a mastectomy on my left breast, I also have a strong family history on my Mother's side and have been given the option of doing the right side as well, I have chosen to go ahead with both. I saw a plastic surgeon about the Tummy sacrifice option and the implants and at the moment I'm going for the implants but to be honest I'm still on the fence, I'm booked in to have my op on the 5th Sept so I need to decide sooner rather than later. The main reason I chose the implants was for symmetry in both breasts and the quicker recovery time, but hearing that the tummy option has feeling and is warm to touch is still playing on my mind, is there anyone on here who's had the implant option who can give me some idea if they are happy with the results etc. xx",
