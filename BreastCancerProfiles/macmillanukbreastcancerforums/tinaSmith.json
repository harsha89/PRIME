      "Content": "Hi Emma, so sorry to here bout your situation. I'm 30yrs old and like you have no childeren, or parterner for that matter, and was diagnosed last month with bc, not as aggresive as yours i dont think. iv had lunmpectomy and sentonal node biopsy wendseday just gone, feeling sore and bored at mo. They origanaly gave me the choice of having mastectomy because of age and it coming back but after having another talk to consultant he was positive he could get it all, find the rusults of surgary for that on thurs. It is a lot to take in and a good friend of mine had to have mastectomy (she is lot older) and wished she had done it in 1st place as she has had 5 surgerys. I think it all depends on how you feel about it all and everyones sircumstances are all different, you just do whats right for you. Sorry for ramberling not got the hang of this yet just thought id get in touch so you know your not the only young person on here, there more our age than i thought would be.. X",

      "Content": "Hi all Sounds like you have nicer nurses than me. Can I steal one of yours please. :-) I`m having FEC-T and just had last lot of FEC ( had 3 in all) My arm started being sore after the 2nd one, I did think i`d just pulled something riding but oncologist told me it was to do with the red drug that begins with E that I cant spell shrinking veins and oncologist got them dilute it more ( infusion over half hour) Well chemo nurse did this while chuntering to another nurse `I think this is a bit ott just for an achy arm` she then proceeded to tell me I should just use it more. I wouldn't mind but I ride 6 days a week groom my ned using sed arm, arm wrestle dog to clip nails, And, And everything else I do that prob shouldn't. She then said she would eat her hat if it hurts after it, well I will be giving her a hat nxt time I go as again 3days after chemo I wake up and couldn't straighten arm, as the day goes on it gets better then seizes up again over night. Said nurse has also bruised hand trying to get cannula in and couldn't apparently I have rhino hind for hands rather that the vein, is that a polite way to say I have weathered hands??? I have had an out door job for 15yrs so wouldn't surprise me. Oops think I had a rant there, never mind. :-) Big hugs and hope your arms are feeling a bit better. T. XX",

It does get easier especially when you know exactly whats happening and treatment plan it was the waiting that drove me mad, im in impatient person at best of times. I just thought Id pop by and say hi. We are all here to help you through. There are a lot of people more further along there journey than me but will help where I can and this site has helped me as I can type out what in thinking rather than actually sitting down and talking to people.. I was diagnosed april when I was 30yrs, I old just went 31 on Sat. My family and friends have been great (all bar one male friend that Iv always classed as my big brother(he is 47 and known me all his life but acting like he is 12 and not answering calls or txt, his loss.) I havnt got children or another half which I did feel like who would want me now, I`m damaged but soon turned that round to look at my war wounds they are a reminder that im an amazing person that will kick cancers ass just like all these amazing people on here( big headed I know but it helped :-) I`v had lumpectomy and sentinol node biopsy, Its grade 3 oestrogen and her2 positive, not in my nodes but had started to spread in to blood vessels, The are sure they have got it all so I`m rather lucky there. I had my 1st round of chemo yesterday which I didnt find bad but we are all different, I cant actually sleep or sit still I had bout 4hrs last night wide awake at 6am and have felt like zebedee on speed all day, I`m sure I`m an exception though. Keep your chin up and always try to look on the positive side. Keep in touch and feel free to send me a friend request if you want. Sorry iv rambled and not even sure if iv made sense, put it down to the drug I had yesterday. T. XX",

      "Content": "Hi Just thought I would pop by and say hi, Please forgive as head not working to well so hope it makes sense. Sorry you find yourself with us but you are in the best place for help and support. I was diagnosed 2 months before my 31st birthday, was a bit of a shock, thought it was just a cyst. You can prepare yourself and at the same time you can stay positive, least that way if the worst happens your ready with gloves on ready to kick ass.. Just sort things out in your head ask as many questions as you want to, doctors and people on here. You have taken a positive step coming here to find out more. Im a bit of a control freak I think and need to know every little detail, It helps me, everyone is different and you do what ever helps you get through it, there is no right or wrong way I dont think as long as you are always looking forward. I found the waiting after scans and then biopsy's to be a nightmare and 2 bank hols which pushed appointments on longer just wanted to know then and there, now I`v had op and got treatment plan and had 1st lot of chemo ( oh another bank hol ment I had to wait another week) and everything is sorted out in head and I know what I`m doing I can look to the light at the end of the tunnel when things can go back to being normal again. Sorry rambling, i`ll stop now. I will keep everything crossed that everything turns out ok for you. :-) T. XXX",
