    "Content": "Hi   I have a port fitted and it has been wonderful, even though I was one of the 1% who hand my lung punctured during the surgery.  That proved so painful and delayed my release from hospital but it was still worth it to have the port. My surgeon positioned it low on my rib cage to reduce scars and to hide it for me.  It is positioned somewhat uncomfortably being on the bra line ( it wasn't when he measured it but post operative sports bra's have thick bands that catch the port). Also its a bit too much on my side (rather than front) so a bit difficult to sleep.  But the chemo going in is painfree...... about the only bit of chemo you can say that about!   Tip: If you need antibiotics intraveniously if you get an infection during chemo insist you have it via a slow (60 mins) saline drip because if you have bad veins everything else is too painful and they won't use your port because they will want to keep it in pristine for the chemo. Also I had the cold cap which is disgustingly painful and you feel like giving up on it, but in my case I never went completely bald so it was worth the pain. If you are going to have it do just get a boy's hair cut because the straggly, thin stuff that is left it awful.  Plus the chemo  may(?) be more effective if it can get at the folicles. All the best of luck and get some tramadol on board before you start your chemo because going round begging GPs for it when you have no energy isn't much fun.  ",
