      "Content": "Hi I have not written anything before but I now feel very unsure of things. Have had 24 lymph nodes removed 7 had cancer cells though the tissue clearance was clear. Now heading for the road of chemo this has hit me how real everything is now. I am frightend and trying to be positive and strong. But now and again I do break down. Its been good looking at how everyone supports each other . I could really do with some extra support right now. Family are good but dont understand how I really feel.",
