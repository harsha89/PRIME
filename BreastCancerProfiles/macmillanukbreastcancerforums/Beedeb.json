      "Content": "Hi My mum has had her first of six rounds of FEC [switching to FECD for last three].   She is day 4 after first dose. Was doing really well apart from not sleeping (think this was more down to steroids) but today really tired and indigestion.  Wondering should we expect this to worsen. Is there anyway of adjusting the steroids to help her sleep next time?  And what can I do to help? Thanks X",
