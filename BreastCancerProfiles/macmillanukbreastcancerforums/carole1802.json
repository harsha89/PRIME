      "Content": "I agree with everything thats been said on here especially that everyone's experiences and reactions to the treatments are as unique and individual as we all are. When I was diagnosed with BC in June 2015, I made a conscious decision to avoid any newspaper articles; online blogs; Google articles etc etc regarding BC as I knew that (like childbirth) most people either like to make light of it or tell you horror stories. I knew that neither of these approaches would be good for me. I've also tried, as far as possible, to distance myself from people who I find emotionally draining. Its not always easy when one of these people is your own Mother but..... I try to remember that everyone deals with things in different ways and V Derbyshire, for whatever, reason chose to deal with it this way. That's her choice but we fellow BC'ers don't have to listen to her words & we should politely but firmly tell anyone who paraphrases her to us of that very fact. Sorry I'm ranting now! And I agree wholeheartedly with the comments regarding chemo. I'm 1/3 of my way through T-Fec and a breeze it is not!",

      "Content": "Hi I was diagnosed with breast cancer on 17/6/15 following a routine mammogram. I've had two lumpectomies and lymphs removed and consultant confident they have removed all the tumour. However, the recommendation was for me to have 6 doses of T-Fec to ensure everything was clear. After a lot of soul-searching I signed the consent & had my 1st dose of T on tuesday (6/10/15) and today I feel totally lousy. Everything aches and I feel so low in myself that I cannot imagine how I'm going to cope with another 5 sessions of this. I'm a single parent- son has just moved out to university and 16 year old daughter lives with me. I'm trying to stay strong for her but its exhausting. My mum isn't dealing well with my health issues (I'm an only child) and although I have a partner it is a relatively new relationship so I don't want to lean on him too much and scare him away! Anyone got any mood boosting tips or things that worked for them to ease the aches? Please! Carole",

      "Content": "I have been in remission for @ 6 months now following surgery, chemo & radio. The chemo has kick started the menopause & I'm struggling with menopausal symptoms-mood changes (tearful or angry), tiredness, aching joints. In my GP's words I'm a prime candidate for HRT but due to breast cancer being oestrogen dependent I can't have HRT. I'm interested in trying herbal supplements/healthy diet to manage the menopause & wondered if anyone else could point me in the right direction by sharing what has worked for them? Thanks",

      "Content": "Sorry I haven't replied to every post individually but thanks to everyone who responded. I feel all at sea I have to admit as the resources/support available post cancer are non-existent it feels! I've been using the lady care magnet before BC & was already taking anti-depressants too. It's the mood swings & aches that I'm really struggling with & as several people mentioned that herbal supplements can raise oestrogen levels I just don't know what to take to ease symptoms. I've decided not to take tamoxifen as I was unhappy about the potential side effects from it. Maybe we should start a petition or something? C x",
