    "Content": "My case sound similar to you too.  I was called back after routine mammogram, had no lump or other indications.  After biopsy I thought my life had ended and was imagining all sorts while waiting results.  When they came also diagnosed with DCIS.  Had WLE but they didn't get it all first time so had to have a wider excision. They have it all this time but as high grade also have to have 15 days radiotherapy.  Went yesterday for my planning appointment and CT scan. Have to say got my self in a panic when I arrived for the appointment, but the scan etc was fine really.  Waiting for radiotherapy to start now, but am quite scared again, although have read shouldn't be too bad.  But you cant help worrying when its happening to you. ",
