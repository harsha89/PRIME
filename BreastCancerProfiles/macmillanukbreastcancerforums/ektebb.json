    "Content": "I have just looked at my almost 2week wounds from lumpectomy and node removal.Â  It looks like the sewer should have done a needlecraft course! will it go down or does the ridged look stay forever? Im having post op review 2mro but just wondered what others had experienced. I know it shouldnt come into the equation what it looks like really as it does mean the cancer lump has been removed. Vanity shouldnt be a part of the game but it still upset me. feeling emotional is this normal??",
