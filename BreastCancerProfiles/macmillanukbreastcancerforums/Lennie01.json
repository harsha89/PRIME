      "Content": "Hi Volvox167 Prior to my DX in May I was running 3 to 4 times a week as well as attending a couple of bootcamp classes with the occasional spin class thrown in.  I had MX in May with immediate temporary expander implant, followed by 15 sessions of RT. I made sure I walked 3 to 5 miles a day after surgery and during RT even tough I found RT quite tiring but I wanted to maintain some level of fitness, I did feel as though I could have gone to spinning classes but I didn't want to aggravate my skin any more than was necessary during RT, i.e sweating and having to wear tight sports bra etc, it probably would have been fine as it turned out I didn't suffer skin problems with RT, thankfully!.  The breast care nurse advised me prior to surgery that it would be about 3months before I was back running and going to bootcamp, as soon as the 3 months was up I popped my trainers on and off I went (albeit it very slowly!) and am now back to running 3 to 4 times a week and have also been spinning a bit.  I haven't yet ventured back to a full on bootcamp class, not because I don't feel up to it but I am still getting used to having the implant ,  but have been doing a bit of  stuff at home, squats, sit ups, lunges etc and have also been attending a yoga class once a week.  Wishing you all the best :-) ",

My consultant said that most side effects settle down after a few months.  Why don't you give them a try and see how you feel after a couple of months as you can alway stop them if you find that you just can't tolerate them.

I don't think a treatment plan can be finalised until they have all the results and it does vary from person to person as there is no 'one size fits all' All the best :-) ",

      "Content": "Hi all Just thought I'd share my August radiotherapy experience with you. Two weeks ago today I finished 15 sessions of Radiotherapy following MX and reconstruction with expander implant. I had radiotherapy at the Churchill in Oxford and found the staff very pleasant and they explained everything and answered any questions I had.  I was given a parking permit for the duration and my appointment times were round about the same time each day, I was seen on time, they were only running a little late twice. It was a 3-4 hour round trip for me, I elected to go weekends so that was a bit quieter and quicker.  I used R1 & R2 creams which I bought on line (none of the staff I mentioned it to had heard of it) and have not had any problems with my skin, have carried on using it for past 2 weeks once treatment had finished as I was told the radiotherapy would keep working for 10-14 days,  the skin has changed colour, a bit like when you  have a tan, my underarm was a little bit sore but I think that was where skin touches skin and hair regrowth from not shaving for a couple of weeks.  I continued to use normal shower gel and deodorant with no sensitivity.  I drank plenty of water to stay hydrated. I did feel tired now and then so had to take a couple of afternoon naps (I work from home so was able to work round them) It is a bit of a slog having to go 5 days a week and I was glad when it finished but the time did go quite quickly, especially as I work and have been doing lots to keep myself busy. I have about 8 of the R1 soothing gel sachets left that I would be happy to post out to someone who is or wants to use it, just PM me. Wishing all the best to everyone along this journey :-) ",
