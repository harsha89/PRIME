      "Content": "Hi Sue. I don't mind you asking at all. I'm on the south coast. My rationale for having this done was that I didn't want to spend the rest of my life being neurotic about my lumpy boobs. I want to be able to put this particular episode behind me and I don't feel I'll be able to do that until they're gone. They wanted to be sure I understood that having it done will not prevent cancer in any way, but for me it will stop me obsessing and worrying about whether the lumps I have are or have turned cancerous. If you need more specific details please PM me. I don't want to cause any dissension amongst the professionals! And let's remember it hasn't been done yet! I have to wait 6 months. However as I was leaving I did actually confirm their agreement to make sure they wouldn't go back on their word. Lets hope they keep it. I hope this explanation helps in some way x",

I have a history of very lumpy boobs and yet my breast cancer was discovered by a routine mammogram and there was no lump! I need to wait 6 months to give my body time to recover from chemo and rads first, but I can't wait to get rid of them! I know absolutely that this is the right decision for me, but we are all so different. Good luck with your decision x",

Hopefully they are going to try me with a port in a couple of weeks to save my veins. I'm sure your line will be fine but just wanted to give a balanced view so you can make a fully informed choice.

Speaking as someone who was in exact situation As you are this time last week and ended up being admitted the best advice I can give is take the pain relief but also monitor your fluid intake and ensure you keep that up too. My gut lining was severely affected by the docetaxol and in the end I was losing more than I was putting in and then started to pass out every time I tried to stand and fell and injured myself.. If you're worried DO NOT hesitate to call your unit today before they close so they can reassure you. The nights are very very long when you're in pain and feeling out of control. I so hope you don't get to where I am and that you find relief quickly. Take very good care of yourself xxx",
