      "Content": "What a lovely idea & thanks for asking us. I am self employed & I had some time off last year as I had a neuropathic illness & was unable to work (Im a fitness instructor). I claimed ESA while I was off. I am now off again but cannot claim ESA as I have not paid enough NI contributions in the previous 12 months. My partner whom I have lived with for 2 years earns too much for me to claim anything. I am having to rely on him to pay for everything for me, my phone, car insurance, travelling money, parking. If I want to go out for a coffee etc I have to ask for some money. He doesnt mind this, but I feel I have no independence at all. I have always worked & cannot claim anything for myself & it seems unfair. There must be other people in this situation who could be helped a little. A lot of our choices are taken away with this awful disease & having to rely on someone for every last penny adds to the stress of it all. help towards the cost of comfy bras/cropped tops for after surgery would also be very helpful. Once again, thanks for asking Cath xx",

      "Content": "Hi everyone A bit of background first. I am 47 & have implants under the muscle. I was called for my first routine mammogram just over 2 weeks ago. I received a letter on 29/5 asking me to go back for second stage screening on 30/5 ( rather fast appointment I thought).  I attended fully expecting it to be something to do with image problems from my implants. They did a diagnostic mammogram which showed a 58mm mass of calcification in my right breast. I then had an ultrasound. The dr said the mass of calcification was suspicious?? and I had a biopsy by xray & they took 10 tissue samples.A clip ws also placed in the site.  I saw a breast care nurse as well, but I cant remember much of what she said. Its all a bit of a blur as I honestly thought I would have it repeated & come straight home.   I feel I should have asked more questions but Im not sure what I would have asked tbh. So should I be worried? should I ring the BCN & ask anything else? I am not a worrier by nature, but the speed of it has knocked me a bit. Thanks for reading xx",

      "Content": "Hi, I got my result on 10/6/13 I have DCIS with microinvasions. It is a 58mm mass so I am having a mastectomy on 1st July. They are doing a sentinel node biopsy at the same time. I am having immediate reconsrtuction with an implant. I couldnt have flap surgery as I didnt have enough body fat lol. I dont even know how I feel. I am ok one minute & in bits the next. I know the surgery is just over 2 weeeks away but it seems like ages away. The surgeon & BCN are fantastic & I felt at ease with them both. I never expected to be here, just like most people I suppose. I will keep reading & asking questions xx",
