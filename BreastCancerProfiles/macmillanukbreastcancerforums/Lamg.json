      "Content": "Hello! I am 5 weeks post bilateral Mastectomy & Reconstruction surgery.  I had stage 2 ductal carcinoma.  Biopsy showed cancer in the tumor that I found myself but biopsly of lymph node came back negative.  I believe the docs when they say every cancer and patient is different so ultimately you have to trust the experts, but it does have feel right to you as well.  Stage 2 for me because of the size of tumor which was bigger than 2 cm.   With all that being said the best plan for me was chemo first then surgery.  IT WAS THE RIGHT decision for me for sure.  They think mine grew pretty quickly and they wanted to stop that growth as soon as possible.  If I had surgery first and they did not get all the cancer cells then I would be recovering from major surgery and not until I was completely recovered would I be able to do Chemo.  Make sense?   I opted for the double mastectomy and reconstructive at the same time so I have expanders under the chest muscles.  2 days after surgery I found out that I had no cancer in any of the tissue, no cancer in any of the lymph nodes that they tested the morning before surgery and NO CANCER in the tumor they took out.  What that means is the chemo id its job and I am CANCER FREE.  Hope this can help anyone out there who may have similar situation   I am on to the next decision.  They recommended radiation and I am not sure if I want to do radiation since I am Cancer Free.  So that is my current struggle.  Love this forum and that we are able to support each other!!!!",

      "Content": "Hello - i just finished my last chemo treatment yesterday. I can say people and dr told me claritin works a bit for joint pain. I didnt try it the first round but i did the second and i think it helped a little. Also, the joint pain was so bad that i couldnt even sleep so the ambien helped to get a good night sleep. You could ask for pain pills. They gave me oxycotin but reall just made me loopy lol. Hot bath helps a little. All sucks but just hang in there lady. Day by day xoxo",

Thank you so much.",

      "Content": "Hello All, I was diagnosed on Valentines Day with stage 2 Breast Cancer.  Just in the breast,  lymph node was biopsied and it was negative.  Ductal is the type and the dr. said stage 2 was based on the size of my tumor which was between 2 and 3 cm.  My plan: Chemo - 8 rounds every other week, surgery and then radiation. The first 4 rounds of chemo done and the the 5th round I started taxol.  Symptoms kicked in a couple days after and the bone, body aches and extreme stomach pains (not nausea) were bad and BAD for a full week after.  Normal?  From what I read most take it every week.  Maybe because it is every other week?  I had heard every week may be easier on the body.  Thoughts?  Should I call the dr. and ask?  I have 3 more rounds! Thank you!",

I am now prepared for what it does to me so if I could get a refill on my sleeping pill and sleep through the night that would be a big help.  It is the oddest pain.  Hips, shins, thighs and the pain in my stomach was awful.  I will let him know and then just do what he recommends.",
