    "Content": "Hello Henty, I am reallty sorry to hear about your diagnosis. I fully understand how you feel I felt the same way after diagnosis but I just wanted to say feelings can change as you progress through treatment they don't stay the same and they have such excellent treatments for BC these days. A good friend of mine gave me some valuable advise her husband has been through lung cancer. She said to focus on after the treatment and something you are going to do whether it be a holiday post treatment or a new hobby etc something to focus on and look forward to after completion of treatments. I also felt like you when first diagnose and I feel sure many others have. Feeling I was letting my family down. My daughter is in the middle of her GCSES. The thing is we shouldn't feel that way we haven't let them down, its not our fault unfortunately cancer can affect anyone at any age. Its something we feel when first diagnosed that we have let our families down when we see them sad and worried but we haven't .I have started my radiotherapy this week and looking forward to finishing it and getting on with my life with family, so feelings do change as you go through your treatment, things dont say the same even though at the time it feels that way.  There are bad days and good and its ok to have bad days and admit how you feel. Infact it does you good to let it out you can't bottle up your feelings. I found my gp very helpful and understanding had a goid cry with her and felt much better since. Your breast nurse is also there for you well worth having a word with her and telling her how yiu feel thats what they are there for. What I have found out going through this treatment that there are many excellent forms of treatment for our cancers inc surgery,  chemo, radiotherapy and hormone treatment.  I was graded stage 2 due to my tumour tjat meant. Chemo rad and hormone but i had an onco test and found out there was no benefit from chemo as the hormone treatment whivh is just a tablet a day will do the job just as well. I must admit first 2 weeks on tablets i was very low and anxious but i have been on them now for a month and my body must be getting used to them as I am no longer feeling this way and feeling much better. I think one of the biggest things tjat has helped me get through all this is that we can actually di alot to help ourselves by healthy eating and exercise. I have bought a smoothie maker and also making veg soups daily.  there are also soup makers which are very popular. Don't forget to spoil yourself with a few treats. going outside is also very helpful as sunlight affects health. I am going to join a tai chi class in couple of weeks after my radiotherapy There are classes you can join at Maggies centres art, exercise etc. I wasn't keen when first diagnosed but feel differently now near end of treatments.  Getting a family member to take me out for a coffeeand lunch  i found helpful after diagnosis and a little walk,  fresh air helped me. The waiting times are the worst. I wish you all the very best dont forget there are people out there to support us like the breast nurse, mc millan and Maggies and being open how we feel to our families can also be a huge help for both them and us.  Xx Take care.",
