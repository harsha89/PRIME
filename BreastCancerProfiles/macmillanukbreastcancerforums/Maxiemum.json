    "Content": "Would like to share my experience. 3 weeks ago suddenly I felt pins and needles in my right breast. Then the pain was all over my whole breast. I couldn\u2019t lie on right side. Neither could I sleep on the left side. I went to see my GP who quickly referred me to breast clinic. Appointment letter gave me 13th Nov. I got meetings with work that day so I rang the clinic looking for a different date. The receptionist asked i go in as my GP stated in the referral it was urgent I get to be seen ASAP. I went to the clinic. The surgeon examined me first. He said I need mammogram. I waited half hour then got called in for mammogram. Got 4 taken. I was properly dressed up but the lady said she needed to take another. Then without any explanation she told me to go out and wait for ultrasound. I was bit confused thinking why I needed both mammogram and ultrasound? Later I googled and found out, mammogram can detect lumps big or small, while ultrasound can tell if the lumps are solid or not. I waited another half hour and got called in for ultrasound. The radiologist is a gentleman in his 50s looking very experienced. He said he found a lump above the nipple on my right breast but he said nothing to worry about it is fibrodanoma. I was quite relieved. However he said i better get checked so he was doing a biopsy. I didn\u2019t dare to look or question but the process was ultrasound guided needle then vacuum abstracted some tissues, I saw the tissues are bloody coloured. I waited another half hour before got called in to see the surgeon, he said I should get another appointment letter for the following week for the biopsy results but he said clearly there is nothing to worry about. I went home. Exhausted. I took the plaster off bedtime. It was not even noticeable but it was a bit sore. I was busy working for the week but kept thinking about it a bit worried but too tired to think deep. Letter came on Wednesday giving me appointment for following Monday 20th. Then it was the weekend before my biopsy results appointment I spent any free time googling and reading on breast cancer. The more I researched the more I felt mine fit cancer symptoms. Sunday I was dreaming all night I was in the clinic waiting forever then got called in and told it was cancer. Monday my husband took me in. Appointment was 1:40 but it was delayed. The clinic was warm. My husband was sweating and I was feeling physically sick. Every time the nurse was calling names I wished it was me and I wished it was not me. I got so scared I felt so sick.  Delayed 40 mins we were called in. The surgeon said it is good news your biopsy was normal. Oh I said doctor I was scared to death. The surgeon said he did tell me not to worry. Then I believed the doctors were not playing down. The radiologist didn\u2019t play down either.  I feel like writing this down to those waiting on biopsy results nervously. If the doctors didn\u2019t look concerned but still ordered you biopsy they were mostly likely being cautious only. Surgeon exam, mammogram plus ultrasound all together do not show cancer, biopsy tend to be good news.",
