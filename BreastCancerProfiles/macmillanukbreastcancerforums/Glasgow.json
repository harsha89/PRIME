      "Content": "Hi all, Just wondering if anybody was offered to use (or has used) the Oncotype Dx test to help decide treatment options following  single mastectomy. The test has recently been implemented in NHS. It is basically a genetic test done on your tumours to estimate the benefit of having chemo (when there is no spread to lymph nodes). They will be looking at the expression of 21 genes from the tissues I had removed during surgery and based on this they will assign a score between 0 and 100. If your score is between 0 and 18, you will be put in the \"low group\" meaning they will not give you chemo. I think a score of 19 to 32 is the \"intermediate group\" and it is still a gray area in terms of whether treatment would be beneficial or not, and scores of above 32 are considered high so they will give you chemo. I have been told that based on my clinical and pathological features, they would give me chemo now. However we can use the Oncotype test at this stage for additional information regarding whether chemo would benefit me. Nevertheless, if I go with the test I can't change my mind, meaning that if I fall in the low group and have a score of 18, then they will not give me chemo. I'm just not sure if I would feel ok not having treatment if I fall on the higher end of the low group but at the same time don't want to put my body through un- necessary treatments!!! It's sooooo difficult to decide!!!  Anybody been in this situation? Thanks for your time. Xxx",

      "Content": "Hi Rainbow Debs, Mine has been quite an agonising decision but to cut the story short, I didn't go with the test and I've just recently started chemo. I have very good reasons for this and please remember that each patient has their own clinical and pathological features that need to be taken into consideration when deciding on the most appropriate treatment.  In my case, multiple tumours were found in my breast and they were all at the highest grade. While no lymph node involvement was detected, my oncologist and I had already decided that if I went for the test and the results fell anywhere in the intermediate range (including low intermediate) or high I would get chemo. Following further research into this, I found that the majority of high grades tumours generally come back with an Oncotype Dx score in the high intermediate or high score, so I decided to just go with the chemo, instead of delaying the treatment further. I do hope your results come back in the low range. I know the intermediate range will require further discussions but hopefully your oncologist can guide you well. Good luck with everything. Stay strong (I know it's not easy!). Xxx",

      "Content": "Thank you Julia and Daisy! I do think that the Oncotype Dx test is really valuable and I was very positive about it until they have put a doubt in my mind by saying \"as long as you are ok with the thought that there could be one cell that has escaped but you can't have chemo if you are a low score\"!!! I understand that no test is 100% but when they put it like that... I guess I'll never know what the right answer is, I just have to pick a path and follow it through! Thank you again for your time!  I hope you are all doing well",

      "Content": "Hi Jane, I know it is difficult but you must not compare yourself to others. We are all different, we may have had similar cancers or it looks like we have a similar situation to somebody else, but ultimately we have different history and treatment is also based on this (i.e. Age, previous history, family history, current health etc.). I am sure your oncologist made his/her decision based on your overall results and I'm sure they haven't taken things lightly. You just need to trust them and don't dwell too much about things...hopefully it will get easier for you.  I had a quick look at your profile and we are very different. I'm 40 years old, had 4 tumours of various sizes in my right breast, they were all grade 3 and I also had a different cancer two years ago. My family history is not that \"clean\" either so I guess for me they are evaluating all of these factors before we decide what's the best way forward. I wish you all the best and try to stay positive Xxx",

      "Content": "Hi Rainbow, The information I got regarding correlation of high grade tumours with intermediate/high Oncotype Dx score comes from studies that are still at the research level, i.e. Nothing has been proven yet as there is still very limited data and no clinical trials have specifically looked at relating tumour grade with Oncotype score yet.  So it is right that they have offered you the test, as they did with me too. I just wanted to make this clear in case other people reading this get confused. I based my decision on many factors relating specifically to my circumstances, by no means I am trying to say that if you have a high grade tumour you should not have or not be offered the test.  Let us know how you get on! Waiting is painful but you are almost there! Xxx",
