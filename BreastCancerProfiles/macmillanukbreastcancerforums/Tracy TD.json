I told myself if i had a choice between losing my hair or my life then it was a no brainer hair had to go.the following day i answered my front door and never even thought about doing so.give ur mum plenty of compliments reassure mum that its only hair and can grow back its all part of the recovery process.If im honest i only wore my wig once couldnt stand the itchy scalp. Hugs to you and mum Tracyx",

Idon't know where you live , but I'm based in Leeds , at st James,s hospital they have the Robert Ogden Millan centre it could be worthwhile checking to see if they have this service at the hospital where you are getting treatment ,if so give them a call there are staff there you can talk to or give the MacMillan helpline a call don't suffer alone its good to talk and there are plenty of us here that can and will support you. I got through as you will,good luck and sending you hugs and support for your journey.stay strong even though its hardI'm a survivor ,there is a light at the end of the tunnel even though you may not think it at mo.

Stay strong ,think positive if you have any worries call your onc or bcn they are there to help.everyone on here can help with advice or if you just need to ramble,they understand ,some of them are going through the same as you ,or have got through to the other side of cancer .you can survive this.Most importantly rest when your body tells you to ,you need strength to fight and to get you through chemo. Good luck and good wishes . Tracyx",

Or lung , what they don't tell you is that docetaxol(tax) can cause long term side effects such ad strokes although this doesn't effect everyone. Unfortunately it did me I had a mild stroke during treatment last April and I came out of hospital this march after a week having suffered another 3. Doctors have told meI could have a major stroke at anytime and no point worrying about it as if its going to happen it will I'm on meds to try prevent it but I live everyday frightened that it could be my last. My advice is live for today don't put off till tomorrow I've been to see Ali Campbell from ub40 live, I'm going abroad in sept and I'm still here to see my grandson turn 9 today.If this lousy disease decides to turn up again I'm gonna kick it up the ass just like I've already done ad you will also.

I had chemo and its not a walk in the park,in the end its mums decision to have chemo or not,but it would be in her best interests to do so. All you can do is support mum in her decision and be there for her try to talk to mum about how your feeling or maybe you could talk to george and jackie on this forum or dreamthief they are full of information. I hope i have been of some help to you,if you need anyone to chat to ,unload on or advise please ask for it on this forum their a great bunch and were all here to help and support one another. Remember i survived cancer kicked its ar!! As have a lot of ladies and gents here.Im sure with the right guidance your mum will too shes had the op the cancer has been eliminated the chemo and rads are there as a precaution to ensure no little bits have gone astray.

I was diagnosed with triple negative bc in nov 2012 my stage was 1 and i was grade 3 so it was very aggressive i was told. I had c and tax. I was offered the cold cap too . I had 6 sessions of chemo followed by 20 sessions of radiotherapy.the first 3 sessions i had c ,it was pretty rough side effects include sickness upset tummy headaches tiredness weightloss but these side effects dont happen to everyone it all depends on the dosage of chemo you are given.hair loss happened for me even after i tried the coldcap but that doesnt happen to everyone some people just get that their hair thins. The taxotere is a whole different ball game side effects are pains in the large bones tiredness you could lose your toe and fingernails too. You can get mouthwash and use bonjela for mouth ulcers and thrush some hospitals provide these items. With the tax you can also have bad reactions to it so you are given steroids to start taking the eve before and on the morning of your chemo.i was given an injection 24 hours after my tax into my stomach by my partner then everyday for another four days after that. I hope this has helped you but if you have any doubts speak to your bcn or chemo nurse you should see her a week prior to your treatment.Im sorry if this seems scarey but i would rather be honest than not. Good luck with treatment stay strong eat well and avoid takeaway foods .only eat fruit that you can peel avoid anyone with colds sore throats or any infection. You will get through this and everyone is here to help comfort and give you advice. Its a hard battle but im positive you will do it. Tracyxx",

Im based in Leeds and have had a yearly mammogram each year since my treatment stopped,saying that i have had many probs.nothing has been mentioned here about cut backs and im hoping it doesnt happen.The government have no right to play god ,checkups screening are important they save lives,there are a lot of women and men out there who dont regularly check themselves and if they do then tend to ignore. Good luck for the future and im so glad that you have got to the end of the tunnel that was your journey.

Ive been back several times and been told its all normal after effects from rads.dont wear underwired bras if you can wear a sports bra.i also wear a prostethic breast implant to even myself up it just irritates when i get warm so i put baby talc in my bra cup. It does help to wear a soft cotton bra for bed as well. I cant say when the tenderness will ease ,as ive had problems for the last two years ,but everyone is different.

Have they explained or given you any creams etc?.rads can make the area very red and sore,my skin was severely burnt and very painful but i did have 20 sessions plus a week of strong booster radiotherapy as my tumor was large on the chest wall and aggressive. This doesnt happen to everyone for most its a breeze ,lets be honest compared to some chemo drugs anything is a walk in the park.if you need any info bout creams gel pads etc post on forum or pm me .if i can help i will.when i was going through treatment i didnt get much help as i didnt find this amazing forum and all the special unique people on here until well after my treatment had finished but ive made so.e lovely friends and had some good advice.

The surgeonI saw said there wasn't a lot of difference to him but to me there is and will be as I put on weight as the treated breast will now stay where it is.(at least I won't have to worry about my nipple looking at my naval on that breast). Its so annoying. And upsetting when women that have been through what we have feel we have to fight to get what we feel we need,when others get surgery on NHS to pursue their career as an ESCORT ie ( Josie Cunningham) in papers recently she only lives around the corner from me,turns out she is the niece of my step uncle .

Or you could jot things down so you can recap later or ask someone to do this for you. Good luck again and post here there are lots of ladies and gents to offer a chat or advice. Tracyx",

      "Content": "Morning susie mb,Im a triple negative grade 3 breast cancer survivor yeahhhhh, there is a light at the end of the tunnel .your only at the beginning of this journey but you will get lots of advice and help here.The cold cap does work and as Ali Owl said its bloody freezing and chemo takes longer,i was 4 hours .However it doesnt work for everyone ,it all depends on the type grade of cancer and if its hormone responsive or negative ,there are lots of reasons .your bcn will advise you as to whether or not its worth trying .I was told by my onc that i would defo lose my hair ,but i tried the cold cap anyway ,thought it may give me a chance to keep my locks a little longer,but it didnt work for me ,i began losing my hair after my first chemo.That doesnt mean it wont work for you everyones journey is different .I would definately give it a go afterall you have to try if not then you will never know if it would have worked or not. Its your journey only you can decide ,im not going to say its easy as it isnt ,when you have a choice of losing hair ,going through the path of treatment you have to or life !!! Then i would rather be here and have no hair(as my grandson of 8 at the time said to me) its better that he had me here without hair than not at all. You will get through ,Ali owl has just celebrated another birthday and not long ago i was giving her the same advise. Stay strong ,think positive ,do as your onc advises and call the hospital or your bcn if you are unsure about anything. Thinking of you . Tracyx",
