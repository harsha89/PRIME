      "Content": "Sorry to hear you're having a rough time. For me, being diagnosed and then having treatment was all such a whirlwind that it was/is impossible to deal with everything at once. But some days are just overwhelming, and I think we all feel like you do today at some point. I can totally relate to how you feel about your hair. It's been nearly as tough as hearing I have cancer! I'm half way through chemo, and have used the cold cap, so far have kept most of my hair, but have lost quite a bit on top.  I went from a shoulder length, thick mane of hair which I love to having a pixie cut after my first chemo. I waited until I felt mentally strong enough (about 16 days after chemo), and booked with a sympathetic hairdresser. By then, my hair was falling out quite a lot (noticeable to me, but not to anyone else!) and I was getting fed up of vacuuming hair up all the time. I did manage to keep some hair by washing it only once a week, using a wide tooth comb and dry shampoo in between wet washes. I wore scarves or a beanie around the house to cover it up when it was dirty, and to catch the falling hairs. I actually really like my pixie cut, and my scalp hurts less without the weight of long hair. I am glad I had my cut shorter, but waiting until I felt strong enough to go for the chop really helped the process.  Right now, I'm debating whether to have it shaved completely and ditch the cold cap as it is colder when your hair is short. But paracetemol beforehand and wrapping up warmly help. I've also learned to take chemo one day at a time. Some days are really tough, but it's another day towards treatment being finished, and I know I will feel better soon. Most of the time I feel ok, and some days I feel really great. Hope tomorrow is a better day for you x ",

      "Content": "Hi Tia, I really feel for you making this decision, I was in a similar position in February this year. I never knew cancer came with decisions (!), and the stress is the last thing you need at an already anxious time. I rationalised it by saying if there was a real risk, then I would not be allowed the choice by the medical team. However, my surgeon, oncologist and radiologist all had slightly different opinions which really did not help me.  My diagnosis is a little different to yours. I had stage 2b, grade 3 IDC. My tumour was 25mm, so I was lucky to only need a lumpectomy. They removed three lymph nodes during the surgery, and one of these had cancer in. So I had a choice 1. More surgery for complete clearance 2. Radiotherapy to area 3. Do nothing additional. In America, standard protocol now is to not do ANC as studies suggest that with the additional therapies (in my case, radiotherapy, FEC-T chemotherapy and Tamoxifen), there is no improvement to prognosis by doing the clearance. This is because, even if there was cancer in other lymph nodes, these therapies should target it. This is what is behind the POSNOC trial. I did a huge amount of research in to this, I even did a spreadsheet with the pro's and con's of each option. In the end I decided to not have a clearance (which my surgeon supported) as I did not want the increased risk of lymphodema.  The view I took was that if the cancer ever comes back, I want to be able to look back and be comfortable with my decision. It was right for me, but we are all different. Good luck with your decision. X x ",

Now on tamoxifen (what a joy, hot flushes and mood swings!). Everyone is really happy for me, which I appreciate, but I feel nervous and quite tearful. The fatigue doesn't help, I know, but I feel like there's a tsunami of emotions inside me that are about to break through and overwhelm me.  There is definitely a need for a better understanding of how we recover and rebuild from cancer, but this is not something we see in the media, or is portrayed enough by cancer charities.  And don't get me started on Brave The Shave, I hate it with a passion! x ",

I wholeheartedly support the intent of anyone who wishes to raise funds for any charity, but the marketing of this campaign is offensive and insensitive. If anyone I knew wanted to shave their head, I would be very upset, and try to dissuade them - why should my cancer result in others going through distress? To me it is not a show of solidarity and support. Those are shown by visiting me, checking in on me, taking me for walks, being there for me at my lowest moments. I agree with many of the other comments that shaving your head out of choice is incomparable with watching your own identity, and confidence, go down the plughole day after day for weeks on end. And that doesn't require bravery, but truck loads of resilience, as you have no choice when you lose hair through treatment. ",

I used to have shoulder length hair, which I had cut to a pixie style to minimise the trauma of hair loss after first FEC. So far, I've lost quite a bit of hair, but I still look presentable, except from above ;-) My dilemma is whether I can do the cold cap again. The first time it was uncomfortable, but bearable. I take paracetemol beforehand and wrap up warm. But the second time, because I had no hair on the back of my neck (having had it cut) I got unbearably cold and that evening I felt very weak and ill, I was so chilled to the bone. So I now associate the nausea with being unbearably cold. The prospect of going bald is currently preferable to the thought of another four chemo sessions spending 3 hours with the cold cap on. Has anyone else had a similar experience? x ",

I showed breast care nurse, she was a little baffled but reassuring and said keep an eye on it. My temperature not raised. Over last couple of days, rash/spots spread to my right eye and right eye is swollen (huge eye bag!) . Phoned chemo nurse who said take antihistamine for itchy rash. I did this, but knew there was more to it. So, just been to a&e and been diagnosed with shingles. Apparently it's chicken pox virus which lays dormant in our bodies (if we've had it) and low immune system because of chemo gives it chance to raise its ugly head! My concern is it will delay my chemo on Tuesday. See oncologist Monday so will know then. Thought I'd share as I'm kicking myself I didn't go to a&e a couple of days ago.

I'm writing this 6 days after my 5th round of chemo. I've found docetaxol (T) easier than FEC to be honest, but we're all different. The pattern for me is that the week after chemo I am too fatigued to do much at all, but then I get progressively stronger. In the second and third weeks, I still cycle, go to spin classes (take antibacterial wipes to clean the equipment first as gyms are a germ's heaven), yoga and run. I have done a Race For Life and The Pink Ribbon Tour whilst on chemo. With regards to weight, I was just as paranoid about this as I was about losing my hair. Well, I have cold capped and still have a lot of hair (don't need a wig yet) although the hair loss is distressing, so it is good to prepare for that. Getting a short cut in advance is brilliant - I'm glad I did. No nose hairs make spicy food a challenge! With regards to weight, I put on about 5lbs with the steroids, but lose it straight away over the course of the first week after chemo. I have actually lost about 4lbs in total since starting chemo as I am keeping active. I am eating some crazy stuff (cardboard mouth is a good description) but still watching what I eat. The change in identity through hair loss was tough for me, so I wanted to maintain my weight and fitness. It's been worth it.  The other area I'd recommend is mindfulness/mediation/walking outdoors - whatever you need to calm your mind and fill your soul. It is so worth investing in your emotional health - I have and it has helped me when the side effects have been tough.  Best of luck x x",
