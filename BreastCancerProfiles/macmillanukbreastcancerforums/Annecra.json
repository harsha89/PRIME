      "Content": "Hi Guys....I\u2019m new to the group and had my op yesterday, it\u2019s all been a bit of a whirlwind. I was diagnosed as having stage 2 Invasive breast cancer on Wednesday and as I said had my op yesterday. While I feel very lucky not to have had a long wait, i was still very stressed. During the op they also removed lymph node/s. I don\u2019t know how many were removed as I only saw nursing staff afterwards. It seems  I\u2019ll have to wait until my next appointment which will be 2-3 weeks away, it\u2019ll  feel like a very long time. Is this the norm? My shoulder feels okay, I expected it to be more stiff. Does it stiffen with time or do you feel it immediately? Really hoping that this is it as I fell while out running and broke my other shoulder recently, could be doing without them both feeling sore and stiff I\u2019ve not had a look around the site yet but I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll find lots of good advice. Who\u2019d have thought we\u2019d end up being part of this community.",

      "Content": "Thank you very much for your reply. It was a lumpectomy that I had, I was also given exercises to do, which I have done. It\u2019s good to know that it is the norm to wait this amount of time. My hubby is happy to hear you telling me to take it easy. He\u2019s just said I never listen to him, which I do I\u2019ve no doubt done far too much today and will need to learn to be still and patient at times. ",
