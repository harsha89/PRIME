      "Content": "Hi Stuart/all So sorry to read your thread about Elaine, you must be going through a torrid time at present. I was diagnosed in May this year with bone mets in my right humerous following BC/mastectomy in May 2004. I recently had a clear MRI scan following a CT which showed 'spots' on my liver, I waited 14 weeks in total for the MRI and results, its always such a worry and the waiting is the worst thing possible with this disease. I have different hormonal treatments and also take a bone strengthening tablet daily (Ibandronic Acid) and calcium tablets too. I still have quite a lot of pain in my arm but have been told that it takes a while for the cells to renew themselves. You always wonder if its spreading and whether it will come back elsewhere so I'ts dreadful for you and Elaine that this unfortunate situation has happened. I truly hope that the neurologist is able to offer some hope to you both. Please let us know how she gets on. This site offers you support constantly, so we'll all focus on positive thoughts for you both. Love and best wishes Carole xxxxx",

      "Content": "Hi Lesley I've just come across your thread. Its such a tragedy when this happens. I used to work with a fantastic girl called Valerie, we were both seconded to our HQ in London so shared a flat for 6 months. During that time she was diagnosed with secondary cancer (breast). She'd never told us that she'd had breast cancer before she started working with us so it was a shock. She died 3 years later having been told originally that she had about 6 months to live. A more vibrant, sweet, caring person was hard to find. She died in 1998 aged 38. I never imagined that 6 years later I'd be fighting the same fight. But I'm inspired by her, she approached each day with such vigour and enthusiasm - right to the end, so that's my approach too. I think of her always. She left me a pair of diamond earrings and we had one of the diamonds put into Paul's wedding ring. I hadn't decided what to do with the other one (it didn't feel right to wear the earrings). Our friends live on in our thoughts and I feel honoured to have known her. I know you will feel the same. Keep strong Lesley. Love Carole xxxxx",

      "Content": "Hi there Chrisie and KG55 Sorry to hear about your relative Chrisie must be a very worrying time for you/them. I too have recently been diagnosed as having secondary bone cancer from breast. I have to say, I didn't think about it having a grading and have not asked my Oncologist about my own prognosis but will do so when I see her next week. Like KG55 I do know about the grading system and know that grade 4, stage 4 is the worst. If you look on the Cancer Backup main site it does explain the different gradings and stages. From what I understand secondaries are usually classed as incurable until they stop responding to treatment when a terminal diagnosis is made. This could be what your relative has been told. I also read up on bone secondaries on the Q&A'a on CB main site and effectively it says that bone cancer generally doesn't kill you, its when the cancer spreads into other areas (soft tissue etc.) when it gets you. My doctor told me that she is treating a woman who has had bone secondaries for 20 years and whilst it keeps coming back in various bones they keep zapping it with radio therapy and she lives a normal(ish) life (so that's what I'm hoping for!!) KG55 - you've had yours for 6 years is it contained? Do you still have treatment etc. I'm very interested in how it affects your everyday life it at all. Hope this helps Chrisie and look forward to hearing from you KG55. Kind regards Carole xx",

      "Content": "Hi Caroline (& Joyousone) Just something else to remember, the effects of chemo can be cumulative, I was OKish for the first one or two then started to feel really cr*ppy from then on. I can only endorse what everyone else says, take as much rest as you can, remember that you will be neutrapenic (don't know if that's spelt right) about a week or so after you've had your chemo - this means your white blood count is at its lowest and you need to be careful not to contract any infections, etc. (So avoid putting your hand on the rail if you use escalators, etc!) And, when its all over and you're feeling a lot better - celebrate!!! Love Carole",
