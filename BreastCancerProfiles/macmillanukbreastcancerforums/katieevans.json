    "Content": "Hi, I'm Katie and I'm 19, my mum was recently diagnosed with breast cancer.  My mum's 52, doesn't drink regularly or much, doesn't smoke, and stays healthy. She's recently been diagnosed with breast cancer, which the doctors said was age related and not genetic.  She had a routine breast screening and they found a small lump, which they thought could be treated with a lumpectomy then radiotherapy. However after her lumpectomy she was told she needed to go back in. Turns out she has a mixed tumour, one of which doesn't form lumps or show up on scans and is only really found in women 45-55. This was much further progressed than they thought, and she was on the borderline for tumour size requiring a mastectomy, so decided to have one. She got told that after her operation she'll need chemotherapy and then probably radiotherapy, and so can't have reconstructive surgery right away. Given that, my questions are:  What stage/grade does it sound like? How risky is a mastectomy?  How serious is the cancer given all the treatment she needs?  Is it still likely she'll survive?  Is the cancer likely to reoccur later?  Will all of this significantly shorten her life expectancy?  Also, the cancer cells were found in one of her lymph nodes. How does this affect things? I didn't want to ask her these questions because I didn't want to upset her, and it's all happened very very fast. Any information would be hugely appreciated. ",
