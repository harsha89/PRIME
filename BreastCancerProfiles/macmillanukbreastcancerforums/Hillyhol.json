      "Content": "Thank you so much for your advice everyone. My ma's had her first chemo, and although it's not been fun, she's been amazingly strong and is taking the side effects on like a woman possessed! It was very scary to see her being pumped full of the FEC drugs - alot of pretty toxic stuff for a little lady. Anyway, the fantastic news is she has no secondaries! which has given us a massive boost to kick whatever cancer cells she may have left after her lumpectomy out of there for good. I know we're just at the start of this journey and there is a long way to go, but at the moment things are looking up. Thanks again, and i'm sure i'll speak to you all very soon, hollyxxx",

      "Content": "Hello, I'm a newbie, my mum has been diagnosed with breast cancer about two months ago, she's had a lumpectomy and is about to start 24 weeks of chemo. She seems quite calm actually but I am terrified. We find out tomorrow if the cancer has spread to any other parts of her body. I just wanted to ask what people have found useful from their family in terms of support? My mum lives with us in the week and until the cancer was caring for my 18 month old daughter whilst I completed my training, so she is a BIG part of our lives. I just feel so useless what can I do or not do to help her get through this? Any advice gratefully accepted. Best wishes to all those supporting/ undergoing/ recovering from treatment. Hollyxx",
