      "Content": "Hi everyone, I'm new here. Just been diagnosed with a large area of high grade DCIS which will mean a mastectomy on one side. Trying to decide on whether or not to have a reconstruction and keep flip-flopping between wanting one and not wanting one (haven't ruled out going flat on one side and using prostheses). I have very small boobs (AA or A depending on who measures them) and it's the larger of the two that's being removed. I'm 50 so they're likely to be heading south some time soon! The surgeon said they wouldn't do a LD reconstruction as I'm a rower, and I don't have enough fat for an abdominal reconstruction (also have a large appendix scar). She mentioned the possibility of a pre-pectoral AMD reconstruction but I haven't been able to find out much about it. My concerns are these: 1. Given that I'm pretty tiny would even a small pre-pectoral implant be likely to look weird and much bigger and firmer than my existing boob? I've heard they're pretty good if you're small-chested, but not sure what they're really like. 2. Would the implant be uncomfortable when I return to sport? I have to lift a heavy boat over my head as part of my regular training and also do circuit training which involves a lot of running, jumping and press-ups, as well as weight training. 3. Question for those of you who didn't have a reconstruction: how much of a faff are the prostheses? I'm pretty small so wouldn't need anything major, but concerned I'd get annoyed by constantly having to find a clean one and wondering if they move around / pop out!! 4. Would an implant make it harder to check my remaining breast for recurrence? I'm bound to be a bit neurotic after the surgery (I always have been as my mum has had BC) and want to make checking as easy as possible. I know the chances of recurrence are slim but even a 1% chance is enough to make me anxious. 5. Would you still have mammograms on the reconstructed breast with a pre-pectoral implant? And if so, what does that feel like? So many questions!! I'm seeing the BCN on Thursday to go through everything and then meeting the surgeon on Monday to make a final decision, so will have a chance to go through all my concerns with them, but would love to hear of anyone else's experiences to help me decide. I'm not really terribly worried about appearance but at the same time don't want a giant cricket ball on my chest!! All advice and experiences very welcome.",

      "Content": "Lynndyloo, we are SO SIMILAR!! Exactly the issues that are going through my mind. Not sure if I'll need radiotherapy - depends what they find in the lymph nodes - and don't want to end up with problems in an implant. One option that floats in and out of my mind is double mastectomy so I could have matching implants (and less worry afterwards as my mum and great aunt had breast cancer) but not sure if that's even going to be an option for me.  Will report back when I've seen the BCN. Absolutely exhausted today with all the thinking (and tossing and turning at night)! Hope you're bearing up OK.",

Although at the initial meeting it seemed kind of assumed I'd want a reconstruction, the BCN was 100% supportive of the idea of not having one and said really it just came down to what worked best with my lifestyle. Good luck in getting there yourself xx",

      "Content": "Had a unilateral mx with no reconstruction six days ago and so far all going well, so I have much to be thankful for and this is a small problem in the scheme of things. My remaining boob (sod\u2019s law, the smaller one) is really very tiny - no more than a mosquito bite, really! - AA at best. While this means the mx isn\u2019t as big a deal for me as it might have been if I were bigger, it\u2019s presenting its own challenges already. My local shop only stocks Royce post-surgery bras which come in a min B/C cup (why??? - looks ridiculous on me!) The Amoena bra the hospital gave me is fine for now but I will need something more normal eventually and there seems to be virtually nothing out there in AA cups.  As for prostheses, even the minimum sized prosthesis with half the stuffing removed looks way bigger than my remaining boob. Sooooo.... anyone discovered a range that caters for people like me? I don\u2019t need a perfect match but something that doesn\u2019t look actively weird would be good!!! My local shop can sew pockets in normal bras which might be the (expensive) answer to the bra issue, but are there any AA prostheses out there? And where could I try some on when I\u2019m out and about again?",
