      "Content": "Snowys Mum I didn't know you couldn't handle a hamster.... :( poor you.....not even with gardening gloves on? I'm sure people will help you if you need it, don't be afraid to ask for help.  Anyway you are not on your own, we are all here for you. Love to you and your furrry little mate  Hi Snowys Mum My nurse was very hesitant about my handling Krakers, she advised to try and avoid it. I was more concerned by the cleaning of him, weekly and a little tidy up every few days, but she said that with latex gloves I can do him the day before my cycle starts and then on week three, my poor little precious. I am a very happy bubbly person generally and even through this I'm not too bad, although the treatment has started yet. I have read so much on here and feel so lucky to only have the bit I have. I have found friends here and comfort and the majority of the people I have met thru my Blip have been wonderful, kind and caring loadsa love Debs x",

      "Content": "Hi Sarah, Thank you so much you have put my mind at ease especially with regard to looking after my furry best friend lol. I have nearly always been independent even though I know I have the love and support of my wonderful family. I know I can do this as its just my blip. I have just finished watching The Big C and Me and although I shed a few tears it was also enlightening as to see other peoples copy strategy. I have had the surgery a few weeks back and stayed with my son and his family for a few days. Once my scarring improved I see the Onco and was told I was borderline for Chemo. I entered into a trial called Endopredict and had to wait a few weeks whilst they did various tests. By the time I was due a return visit to the Onco the results had not come thru so I decided to take control and told them I wanted Chemo so that I had given my body the best chance possible to be cancer free.  You sound like you have been thru a terrible time and thank you for sharing your experience with me. How are things with you now???? Loadsa love Debs x",

      "Content": "Hi Baki thank you so much for your reply it was so helpful. I can face this, I think, and as I live alone it is just my mess thank goodness. When life was normal I used to go to my mummies, an hour and a quarter drive, to see her and have some girly tlc. I have explained that my visits will be a little erratic now. She is planning a big family dinner on the 10th July and my son has said he will sort my hair out for me before then for the great unveiling as such. Please don't feel guilty Baki your family and friends are there for you. Let them in and let them help, they want to and it may be a way of helping them to cope. My mum doesn't drive and is worse than me for emotions, she says she can't help but she helps me financially, and has even cooked me a couple of chicken pies (her speciality, fingers crossed for some taste buds!!!) and her cuddles and love help me beyond words. I was wondering about the order of feeling grotty and then able to do stuff.  Thank you again Baki and please keep in touch.  Best Wishes, Debs x",

      "Content": "Hi guys. As the title suggests, I live alone and start chemo Tuesday. I have the most amazing family but unfortunately they all live an hour at least away. I am stubborn as they have offered to help when I have needed but I prefer to face some things alone. I can cry when I want, sing when I want, sleep when I want - they understand. My son, who has a family and two jobs, has been there on the most important appointments, the ones where I go into my 'I don't understand' mode, so he has helped me make the biggest decision of all, go for Chemo. And so it begins with the picc line tomorrow, and then Chemo on Tuesday. I was wondering if anyone else lives alone and dealing with the problems that we now face. I have my hamster, Krakers, for company but I will even have to leave him alone and goodness knows how I am going to deal with his cleaning etc.  Sorry to keep going on but I have so much whirling around in my head.  Thanks Guys ",

      "Content": "Good afternoon friends. WOW what amazing responses, you are all so kind with your words of help and advice and encouragement, thank you so much. Well I had my first Chemo yesterday and it was nowhere near as bad as I thought, the staff are wonderful and I was just in time for lunch and coffee and biscuits. I got chatting to the other ladies and asked their advice over different things and it started to feel a bit like I imagine WI might, one lady has even offered to bring her quilting in and her felting and teach us lol. As for my hamster Krakers I sorted him yesterday, I wore one pair of gloves to touch and lift him and a different pair for his housey cleaning, then a different pair for my house cleaning so all colour co-ordinated gloves and lots of spray and handwash for me not Krakers. In some case I am finding living alone a blessing as my sleep pattern is starting to be a little over the place and I sometimes need a Nana sleep in the afternoon, until the phone goes like it did today lol. Anyway guys sending mega thanks love and respect and keep fighting. Debs x",
