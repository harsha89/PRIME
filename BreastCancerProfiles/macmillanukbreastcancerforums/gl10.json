    "Content": "Hello Allison, a week ago I had a Mastectomy after having a recurrence of Breast Cancer, to begin with I was certain that  there was to be no reconstruction, now I am not so sure, my moods have also been up and down, smiles and then the waterworks, can you tell me if this is what I can expect. The thought of surgery again frightens me but I miss my breast.   Gina",
