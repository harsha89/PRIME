      "Content": "Hi everyone, ive been reading through the posts on here since my diagnosis just over a week ago and finally plucked up the courage to join. Im 54, my family history is strong (mum breast cancer at 35 died at 41) maternal grandmother breast cancer in her 80s, mum\u2019s 4 sisters all were post menopausal breast cancer and thankfully all alive. On a routine mammogram I had a large area of calcification of 6cm, called back for a further mammogram and ultrasound in which they said I have an area of suspicion so a biopsy was taken and a titanium clip added. Results were a tumour 26mm grade 2 invasive ductal carcinoma. im having an MRI with a contrast dye on Monday Morning to check the area of calcification so my surgeon can decide on lumpectomy or mastectomy. its Er + and HER 2 negative. Has anybody had similar large areas of calcification and di they show up more tumours or DCIS? So worried it\u2019s just awful and I can\u2019t bear how upsetting it is for my children. 2 daughters in early thirties (both being referred to family history clinic) and a son in his early twenties. I\u2019ve been holding it together all week as trying to reassure everyone that I\u2019ll be ok  and then I just fell apart yesterday and sobbed. I feel better today and I think joining this community will help. Thank you for reading Tina x",
