We were aiming for 1 hour and smashed it in 50 minutes.  Very pleased as the course was not flat. Made me think we should have a race/event just for cancer patients/ex patients, just to give hope to those who in the future face a cancer diagnosis to know it's not the end of the world.  Maybe if you are doing a race for life event please put you are running for yourself on your back sign - I found it inspiring as you can't tell from looking at people.",

To achieve this I seriously reduced my carbs so potatoes, rice, pasta, bread is now restricted and I try to stay under 40-50g of carbs a day.  All carbs turn to sugar so no use just watching sugar content in body. I eat good protein, as much as I want, so chicken, butter, cream are all fine.   Also restrict root veg like swede and fruit.  On the plus side I feel so much better and everyone constantly remarks how well I look.

I had this in November and it measured my average blood glucose over previous 8-12 weeks.  My level was 117 (this meant my blood glucose level was 18).  Under 42 is non diabetic, under 48 is pre diabetic.  Anything over 48 or over is diabetic.  In three months I reduced my Hba1c to 42.  My diabetic nurse was amazed as I'm not on a high level of meds.  It was all down to severely restricting carbs.  Through testing I know how much carbs I can tolerate so I know I can eat a slice of Tesco finest high protein bread without too much of an issue but ordinary whole meal bread spikes me.  Home made cakes not too bad in moderation, vegan cakes very good.  Shop bought cake and the rise is through the roof.  Fruit they say to stick to berries (I love strawberries with double cream now) but again by testing you might find that eating other fruit agrees with you. Generally fresh prepared food I tolerate better than the same ingredients in ready meals.  I eat to my meter and everyone is individual.  Some can tolerate porridge, others can't.   The good news is wine can reduce your blood glucose!    It took me almost 3 weeks to get my readings into single figures and stay there.  One thing you should be aware of is that if you are at all out of sorts or stressed it can cause erratic and high readings!  Even if I've had a wakeful night or vivid dream my waking blood sugar can be a 7 instead of normal low 5!",

I *think* they pretty much told me that if it has spread they can't 'cure' me, only prolong my life a little. I need someone with a crystal ball to tell me 'this is all going to be ok' and then I will put my big girl pants on and fight, fight, fight! Others will come along who had lymph node involvement and tell you that they were doing their job and catching the cancer to stop it spreading.  They are your first line of defence, little soldiers ready to stop the assault.  Lymph node involvement is very common. 90% of BC patients survive 5 years ago and remember this statistic is based on using at least 5 year old treatments, the treatments for cancer move a apace so you will be having more modern, targeted treatment.  Of the 10% who don't make it they may have other health conditions or even old age which contributed to their death. So go find your big girl pants and pull them up high but first be kind to yourself and allow yourself to grieve for your former \"carefree\" life.  You will be showing your children valuable life lessons.  It will be good for them to see that you are not always strong and sometimes you need to lean on others.  It will make you more human and approachable when they come to you with their life issues as they will know you will understand what it is to feel scared etc.",

I know it's hard when you have lost a family member to cancer to stop yourself thinking this is the end for you, but it's not.  I had to deal with the fact that my mother and my sister both died a month after receiving a cancer (both different cancers) diagnosis but I then looked to 3 friends who all had breast cancer and were all there like shining beacons living full lives 1/3/7 years later.  Two years on I'm here I've just had second year all clear.

So be kind to yourself, it's okay not to be okay.  Allow yourself to grieve for your previous life with little stress.  Don't feel you need to make others feel okay about your diagnosis, for once put yourself first.  Once you start on the treatment you will be surprised how quickly time goes and you are out the other side.  I still find it hard to believe it's 2 years since I finished treatment.",

I returned a week later for results and I had my hubby with me..  I was told one area was benign and the other DCIS intermediate grade.  Told treatment was surgery followed by radiotherapy.  The BCN then offered to come out to my home to speak to me in a couple of days once I had chance to let the news sink in etc.  I found this useful as my daughter was then home from uni and we had time as a family to talk it through, prepare questions etc. and then she met with us all. This was beginning of June 15.  I had surgery in July and radiotherapy in September.  I've just had my first annual check up and all clear. I hope your biopsy results are good.  Please remember by asking questions on this forum you are probably only going t get responses from people who have had breast cancer as those who had good biopsy results don't usually continue to post on here.",

The waiting for you now is the worst bit.  You are scared, your diagnosis is unknown, your treatment plan if needed unknown.  You may be tempted to google - I did and it didn't help.   Like others on this site said, once you know your treatment plan, timescales it all becomes easier.  I only had surgery and radiotherapy, no chemo.  All my treatment went to plan, my breast care nurse after surgery was fantastic - BCN can make so much difference to how you cope.  My BCN went first diagnosed and attached to the screening unit was not my cup of tea and I didn't find her supportive or helpful.  Loved, loved my second one though. So good luck with scans next week.  The good thing is they don't keep you waiting.  As other's have said 9/10 women with BC will be cured.  You will be in that 9 x ",

Since I've had radiotherapy I seem to have periods where I just zone out.   I can be listening to the radio and realise I haven't really heard anything they have said for ages.  I can read pages of a book and cannot recall what I've read.  I'm back in work next week and although it's a short week and phased return I'm concerned I'm going to zone out in meetings and have people looking at me waiting for me to contribute.  Normally I'm not one to sit there quietly in meetings and I'm quite decisive etc.  but now I'm sort of so laid back I'm horizontal! I've been off work 5 months and have 3 part read books - when I say part read I've read about 50 pages of each!  I can normally read a book in a couple of days!  During these 5 months I've also failed to decide on the colour paint for the cloakroom and my ironing basket shames me into ironing every couple of weeks.  I think I've only baked one lot of cup cakes in this time too. Sadly since rads I cannot drink more than 1 glass of wine.  2 glasses of wine and I wake every hour for a glass of water as I'm dehydrated!  Any Fiddlesticks I love that you've made yourself a chart.   Do you have stars to go on it, do  you award yourself \"star of the week\" if you've been good with your exercises!! ",

      "Content": "I had 2 sites biopsied and they found intermediate grade DCIS in one area (10mm) and benign tissue in other smaller area (5mm).   If I remember correctly they took 6 samples from each site. I had WLE to remove both areas as I wanted any areas that appeared suspect on mammogram removed to prevent future biopsies. Following surgery my DCIS was upgrade to high but it had no invasive cells and I had clear margins.  I then had to wait about 8 weeks to have 15 sessions of radiotherapy. My first BCN and surgeon accused me of being \"very matter of fact\" about having cancer but it was just my way of dealing with it.  I prefer to cry in private and once you know what you are dealing with you just want to get on with it.",

When I was told I had cancer I panicked.  My mother died 1988 from bowel cancer, weeks after being diagnosed and then three years before my diagnosis my sister died a month after being diagnosed with a brain tumour.  I was so scared that the same fate awaited me, dead in weeks.  But statistically speaking 90% of people survive breast cancer and that's based on people treated 5 years ago.  So here I am 2 years later - still niggling away at me at times but I've come out the other side.  You will come out the other side but you need to allow yourself to grieve for your \"cancer free\" life before you can accept that you will have a new \"after cancer\" life. This site is so good for letting out your dark, scary and sometimes twisted humour thoughts.  I can remember being so scared when they said I would have a wire put in my boob prior to surgery but then when she told me I would lie on a table, face down, with my boob hanging through a hole in the table and they would raise it up and work underneath me to mammogram and insert the wire!  The mere thought of this made me laugh that I was like car up on ramps with them on a trolley underneath working on me.  When I told others they didn't seem to find it as amusing as me but I guess we accept that like childbirth we've lost our dignity with our boobs constantly out on show and must be quite a sight for them to see boob hanging through hole!  Good luck with your scans and future treatment.  Know that improved imagining and testing means that with your treatment they can be meticulous in getting clear margins which might not have been the case with your mother. xx",

Funny but I didn\u2019t and still don\u2019t feel lucky!!! Just tell them it\u2019s a big desk being told you have cancer and you need space to process.   The waiting is the worse but treatment moves in stages and you just have to get through it.  I went to New York after biopsy results and before surgery- highly recommend as you are away from well meaning family and friends who can\u2019t help but treat you as a victim.   So my treatment was surgery - lumpectomy (also called WLE wide local excision). I had 11 mm area removed from top of left breast and no significant dimple and invisible scar.  I had wire guided surgery witch meant under a local a fine guide wire inserted in the morning - less painful than biopsy. Then general surgery in afternoon and home in the evening.  I didn\u2019t require any painkillers once home.  Then 6 weeks after surgery 15 daily sessions of radiotherapy - took a few minutes daily for 3 weeks.  Painless procedure just need to keep skin moisturised.   I took sick leave from biopsy till a few weeks after rads ended.  Working through is possible if job accommodating but I chose to just focus on me and my physical and mental well being .  You can read my bio for more info since .  ",

I was recalled age 51 after first routine mammogram.  There were 5 of us at recall clinic which was a one stop repeat mammo, doctor and then if necessary biopsy. We were all together waiting and it was a very long morning for me as I was fifth in the queue.  So here's what happened.  We all had repeat mammo then sent to wait.  Then called in one by one to see doctor. Lady no. 1 told they wanted to biopsy a lump so off she went for her biopsy.  I think they told her they were sure it was breast cancer by the look on her face but she was trying to be brave for the other 4 of us waiting. Lady no. 2 on her second recall, she had been recalled and biopsied 6 months previous.  Doctor told her what they had seen before was no longer there so she was free to go home Lady no. 3 Doctor told her she had a harmless cyst.  She was free to go home Lady no.4 She was told she had early breast cancer and needed a biopsy. Me no.5.  I was told I had 2 very small areas of breast calcifications and she was 99% positive they were benign but biopsy to be sure.  Had biopsy and results 1 week later.  One area benign the other DCIS which is very early BC.  I was told I would have lumpectomy and if necessary hormone tablets.  I just had surgery and radiotherapy.  No chemo.  This was 2 years ago. The waiting is the worst but I \"knew\" from when they did biopsy it was cancer, more by radiographer's behaviour and what she said, or didn't say. You will feel better once tomorrow is over with and if it's not good news it's been caught early and is very treatable.  Good luck and let us know how you get on.  We love it when people post back with good news.",

I found the staff fantastic though and do tell them your skin is reacting, though they normally ask at start of each session if you have any problems.  They used to check the skin under my boob daily as it was red and I was given some dressings.  The pinkness is normal and I was advised to only use Aloe Vera gel or E45 cream but the cream advice varies from not only unit to unit buy consultant to consultant. I found the actual treatment fine and that the staff do their best to make you comfortable - I had a rather tight fitting shell holding me in place.  My unit also had a radiographer dedicated to reviewing you through treatment that I saw 3 times. I'm sitting her now trying not to scratch.  Top of my boob is dry and itchy, underneath is wet and itchy!  Oh the joys.  You will have your down days where you feel like a moaning mini but that's all part of the journey.  Look after yourself x",

      "Content": "I finished rads just over a week ago.  Perhaps it was sitting in the waiting room with so many other people that it finally hit you and made you feel a cancer \"victim\" that has upset you.  I was lucky in that I lived less than a 5 min drive from centre so didn't arrive to early and have to sit there waiting.  I found the waiting area atmosphere a bit gloomy and awkwardly silent! I found the staff fantastic though and do tell them your skin is reacting, though they normally ask at start of each session if you have any problems.  They used to check the skin under my boob daily as it was red and I was given some dressings.  The pinkness is normal and I was advised to only use Aloe Vera gel or E45 cream but the cream advice varies from not only unit to unit buy consultant to consultant. I found the actual treatment fine and that the staff do their best to make you comfortable - I had a rather tight fitting shell holding me in place.  My unit also had a radiographer dedicated to reviewing you through treatment that I saw 3 times. I'm sitting her now trying not to scratch.  Top of my boob is dry and itchy, underneath is wet and itchy!  Oh the joys.  You will have your down days where you feel like a moaning mini but that's all part of the journey.  Look after yourself x",

I waited 3 weeks for my 2 year mammo results.   In my head once it was 10 days with no result I was thinking the worse and my boob was aching. I noticed when I was preoccupied with something else and relaxed there was no more than usual twinges. I wish I could give you some magic potion to hurry things up and take away the stress of waiting.  You do have a plan so while waiting jot down things you want (or don't ) want to ask at your appointments.   Once I had my diagnosis I could ring my BCN at anytime and one even came out to see me 2 days later so that I had time for it to sink in and gather my thoughts.  I hadn't asked about grade/stage etc because I was scared to ask but my daughter told me it was important to ask and know as I had to satisfy myself I was getting appropriate treatment.   My BCN was fab and gentle when I needed it, I never felt a nuisance or over reacting. Now you are posting on here if you have specific questions ask away.  Just think once surgery done you are cancer free and into preventative treatment ",

Yesterday it appeared on my facebook and today a work colleague posted on staff notice board that they were braving the shave.  I so wanted to say something without looking mean spirited. I understand no campaign will please everyone, like I'm not keen on farming one as I'm thinking of the poor lambs that will end up on the dinner table, but something that is so distasteful and patronising to people who have enough to deal with being likened to \"brave fun shavers\" is really unacceptable.  Is there an email address where we can send our comments direct to fund raising staff?  Or perhaps we should take our \"drop the brave\" campaign to the media to raise awareness of how not to patronise people undergoing treatment.",

It's just this campaign seems ill thought out.  I current have a facebook friend \"braving the shave\" and the temptation to ask her not to is hard to resist.  I also have to face a poster in the tea room in work of another \"brave\" shaver!  Again I've bitten my tongue but I won't give to sponsorship going around as my protest and I'm waiting to be asked why!!! It's hard to find ways to raise money that will incite people to sponsor you.  After we lost my sister to Brain tumour we raised over £3000 for Maggies through an auction, raffle, family day etc.  Maggies barely acknowledged our donation, in fact their response felt quite rude and impersonal so now we don't give to Maggies instead we choose to support Brain tumour research.  My point, people are fickle about what they give money to and I know from telling family and friends I dislike this campaign ti's made them think twice about supporting it. You should do what you feel is right for you but as you have already said you feel conflicted as you don't want to upset anyone.  Maybe ask anyone who may see your campaign if they are offended and if they can suggest other ways for you to raise money. I'm tempted to do my own \"dying to live\" event and dye my hair a bright colour for a month to just draw attention to the fact I'm fund raising.  I'm early 50s and have a professional job so will raise some eye brows - at least I have eyebrows to raise lol!",

I didn't undergo Chemo so never lost my hair but I wouldn't dream of patronising someone who has by saying \"I'll shave my hair to be like you\".  Within a week my hair is regrowing and I still have my eyebrows, eyelashes, body hair etc.  Sadly for them they have to continue to be the \"bald person\" for quite a while longer while the person who has \"joined in\" gets praise while the cancer patient gets pity. Fundraisers just because you know someone who had cancer doesn't mean you know how they feel.  We hide so many of our true feelings from family & friends to spare them or to try to remain some dignity and not always be talking about cancer. I'm also incredulous if another poster is correct that you spend £25,000,000 on fundraising activities.",

I've obviously got a disgraceful lifestyle because after recovering from BC I now have type 2 diabetes!  I'm 5lb overweight according to NHS charts.  I've always been more inclined towards vegetarian food as I'm not very keen on meat but love pasta, rice etc.  The diabetic nurse introduced me to the Eatwell plate which is the worse thing I could eat as a diabetic.  I now follow a low carb diet so no rice, pasta or potatoes and 1 slice of bread a day max.  I eat double cream, butter, sauce laden chicken and tofu.  I've lost a little weight but the scales don't show that my waist is 2\" smaller and my bra a size smaller.  My blood sugar is now in non diabetic range when 2 months ago I was 3 times over the this. The fact is that our genes are responsible for how our bodies deal with health issues.  To be type 2 diabetic you need the gene.  Many cancers they have found a gene that increases your risk. But hey it's easy for the medical profession and politicians to feed the media with blaming patients.  If it was lifestyle every fat person would be diabetic and cancer riddled!",

They clearly think you are over exerting yourself and I maybe wrong, but that you are focussing your activities on things that don't need doing, instead of things that do. On a practical level, as you are an experienced property seller, you will know that neutral is best so I wouldn't go spray mad as it's not to everyone's taste. There is a good forum on Moneysavingexpert.com about selling property and people post pictures, ask questions etc. asking for advice on marketing their property.  Trends change and we sometimes forget or ignore that. Being in your home with your family is clearly getting you down so why not meet them on neutral ground. A change of scenery may do you all good and they can't criticise your home activities if they can't see them!!",

I've had 3 surgeries in my life, the first age 7 when parents were not allowed to stay with children in hospital so I saw my mother at 9pm and at 8am the following morning a nurse came and put a hat on my head and two porters to take me to theatre - I still remember them telling me off for crying like a baby!!!! Second one was emergency C-Section and all I remember is them saying we will be waking you soon to see your baby!!!  No time to think. Third one was 3 years ago - lumpectomy and I was struck by how nice and calm they all were.   I had been hanging around all day and finally at 3pm they came to get me.  They told me to bring my pillow.  I was then handed over to the theatre nurse who took me into her little side room to check she had the right person;  I was hugging the pillow like a teddy bear.  She was amazing, as if by magic she realised I was on the point of breaking down when she said \"okay off we go\". Then into the theatre room which didn't look very medical and technical and I met the anaesthetist again - he had come to speak to me earlier to see how I had been after previous anaesthetic.  The theatre nurse was still with me and was amazing at distracting me - she  had me sit up to put electrodes on my back while he was putting in IV access and I didn't notice him doing it and that's the last I remember until I woke up.  This was the only part that was the same as my previous two surgeries - I remember waking up and seeing the clock - it was 4.50!  Previous surgeries I woke at 1.30pm and 7.45pm!!  Strange what you remember!! So good luck for tomorrow, be nice to be cancer free after surgery xx",

I had my original results from biopsy a week after my recall, they gave me an appointment the day they took biopsy and I met my surgeon who outlined first stage of treatment (surgery) and what may follow depending on results from surgery biopsy. After surgery I was told results would be 2 - 3 weeks.  I saw my BC nurse 2 days after surgery and she told me as soon as they came through she would let me know.  I saw her a week later and she said she was off for the next two days but the other BC nurse was aware I was awaiting results.  Friday afternoon at 4.30pm the other BC nurse rang me to say she had my results and wanted to let me know before the weekend.  The results were good, clear margins though and no invasive cells but it was high grade DCIS not intermediate.  I cannot tell you how grateful I was for that phone call.  Maybe if the results had been worse I would have been called to an appointment but my BC nurse is wonderful and understands how stressful patients find waiting so I think she would have rang me or called me to see her that day to talk them through.",

My appt. was 9.45am and I was patient number 5.  The other 4 women had earlier appts. but we all waited together. They were all recalls and we had a repeat mammogram and then sat in a small waiting area for the Doctor to turn up to read the films.  For some reason she was an hour late and didn't turn up till 10am. Then one by one we were called in for her verdict!!  First one in was told she had to have biopsy, second one in was told she could go home, number 3 biopsy, number 4 go home and me biopsy!! I had a lot of waiting around and my hubby was in the exterior waiting area as they don't allow men in to the clinic waiting area as there were 5 women with just a cape covering their top halves! I had my biopsy about 12pm.  I was sat in a chair with my boob in the mammogram machine.  They took 6 samples and then released me and moved to another site on my breast and took another 6 samples.  I can honestly say after getting used to the boob being clamped for first go - radiographer was right you get tolerance quite quickly I had a local and off they went.  I had no pain at all and there was radiographer just dedicated to talking to me and keeping me calm while the other 2 did the deed. I asked for top up of local anaesthetic so had 3 lots all together as I don't see why I should risk pain !!!  Afterward I wasn't sore at all and never needed painkillers. I guessed by comments the radiographers  made that they knew it was likely to be cancer A week later I returned for results and one area was malignant but the other area was benign.  6 weeks later surgery to remove the naughty area, then 6 weeks later radiotherapy. No chemo or hormone treatment for me.  I have had my first annual check up and it was clear thankfully. I was lucky I got off lightly with treatment though I didn't feel very lucky at the time when they told me I had cancer.",

I likeI many others kept the fact I had a recall/biopsy a secret from all but one friend and my hubby.  I told my daughter who was away in uni on the day I had results.  She took it well and a few days later we went on planned holiday to New York!  Best thing I ever did as people's reaction when  you tell them you have cancer is quite tricky to deal with.  I felt I had to make THEM feel better about my diagnosis!  So much head tilting to one side while telling how sorry they were. The waiting for a diagnosis/all clear is the worse.  Once you have a plan you focus and move forward. Fingers crossed for you xx",

I was recalled after routine screening.  I knew something was wrong as friend who was screened same time had letter 3 days later giving all clear.  3 weeks later I had a letter to come back a week later as they \"couldn't give me my results yet\". So I spent a week wondering what they had found and on day of assessment clinic waited hours as there were 5 of us and doctor was running an hour late so I waited almost 4 hours to be told what they had found and for a biopsy! A week later - first week of June,  I had results and was told I would have surgery  last week of June/first week of July.  It was actually mid July before I had surgery.  I had WLE (lumpectomy).  In and out same day.  I had biopsy results from surgery 12 days later. I think I started to relax after I had these results.

One area was benign the other not.  Surgery and radiotherapy and breathe! Roll forward 3 years and I went for my three year anniversary mammogram and had results straight away.  There was an area of concern in my good boob and they did an ultrasound and biopsy there and then.  Then back home to wait 5 days for results.  Call never came as promised so I had to ring.  Biopsy fine but they wanted to rescan.  Another week of waiting for new scan.  Thankfully all fine and I'm clear for another year but the waiting around really got to me.  I was so angry they didn't ring as promised with biopsy results, surely if they knew how hard the waiting was they would ring when promised. My little tip for a mammogram is to count to 20 once they have clamped your boob.  You won't get to 20 as it will release before then and I find it a sort of self hypnosis to make it easy to get through (I have big boobs so they really squash them).  I have biopsy on two occasions, first time 12 samples taken, second time just 2.  I did not find them painful during or after and needed no painkillers.  First time I had two injections of local so boob very numb, second time I only had one injection of local but felt nothing at all.and she was super quick so done in a few minutes.  Good luck with your appointment.  It will soon come round but no harm ringing see if they have a cancellation.  They got me one for my follow up mammogram a couple of weeks ago as they send me an appointment for 28th October",

Since then I've just felt a bit in limbo.  I've talked to 2 friends who are also cancer survivors about how I feel and the have both said the felt/still feel the same.  Having cancer changes you.  I had lunch with another friend yesterday who is 6 years clear of BC and now in the system to have reconstruction.  She also said having cancer changes your attitude to life that only people who have been there can understand. I didn't really publicise I had BC.  Close family, friends were told as were work colleagues but sometimes I have an awkward moment when I meet someone who asks why I'm not in \"work today\".  I never tell them why I'm off as I'm afraid I will cry because of their \"shocked\" reaction. I have a family party tonight so that will be fun with everyone telling me how well I look and it's over and done with now!!!  I'm driving too as I can't drink more than a glass of wine else I am up every hour at night to get a drink of water. Need to toddle off and find something to wear.  My choice is influenced by wearing my most comfy, non itchy bra and a top that doesn't display my boobs too much as I feel everyone is looking at them to see if they can see what I've had done (I know it's in my imagination).",

      "Content": "Almost 10 years ago (when I was 42) I felt a swelling under my left arm pit.  I was referred to breast clinic within 2 weeks.  They did a mammogram and then called me in and told me it was a \"fat pad\" and did an ultrasound to confirm.  I was so relieved. However when I was called for my first routine screening in May this year I was recalled due to suspicious areas on my left breast.  First I knew they were interested in left side was only being mammogrammed on this side.  I had to wait then to see doctor to be told what they would do next.  I worried they had missed something all those years ago but they hadn't. I had a biopsy that same day.  I didn't find it painful at all as I had a local anaesthetic prior to the biopsies being taken.  Worst part was sitting there with my boob clamped in mammogram machine but you get used to the pressure quite quickly.  They took multiple samples from 2 sites but after I had local injection I felt nothing.   I had to wait a week for results and yes it was cancer, but early stage cancer. I have now surgery to remove the offending area and finish radiotherapy next week.  I did not need Chemo. I took my husband with me when recalled but he could not come in with me as they operate the breast clinc as a group session so 4 other women sitting there with the wonderful capes on.  Of the 5 of us recalled only 1 had a lump you could feel, the rest of us were just recalls from routine scanning.  2 people were sent on their way - 1 told what they had seen on routine mammogram had disappeared and second who had lump had a cyst.  Three of us had biopsies.  I don't know their results but one said she had been told before biopsy she had early stages BC as it was evident from the pattern they could see.  I was told I probably just had breast calcification (which is benign)..",

While I was waiting for my biopsy results I kept some sanity by thinking \"rather me than my daughter or a child\" and I truly meant it. I lost my mother to colon cancer, my sister to brain cancer. 30 years ago the treatment and survival rate for colon cancer was poor but has improved dramatically so today my mother would have survived.  Primary brain cancer still has poor survival rates. My gran had BC at age 70 and lived a fit and active life for 20 years after having 2 radical mastectomies 4 years apart and a recurrence.  Her doctor was right that old age would get her not the cancer.  She never got over the unfairness though of her living such a long life while losing 2 of her children to colon cancer.  I have other female relatives who have had BC and they are all 10+ years survivors. When my sister was diagnosed she kept saying she never expected this she always thought she would get breast or colon cancer. So I wish my mother and sister had had breast cancer which is an awful thing to say.",

While I agree it's important for people to attend screening appointments they are called to I am also aware that we can over treat.  My consultant was honest with me in that she was being cautious but others might say she's over treating.

As you had your planning assume you've had your tattoos. I had two and though they are still as dark as when first done they don't bother me at all.   I had to have a shell made which they put on me each session.  They only make you a shell if you are special and have large bosoms!  You should be applying cream to your skin now so it's in good condition.  Some hospitals give our R1 & R2 creams but mine didn't.  They only recommended E45 and Pure Aloe Vera gel (Holland and barratt).   I was told to keep the Aloe Vera in the fridge and apply immediately after radiotherapy and as need to keep boob cool.  I used baby wash as shower gel and baby shampoo for duration so nothing to irritate my skin during and after treatment.  Deodorant is allowed on good side.",

      "Content": "I had a recall from my first routine mammogram at 51 last May.  I had no symptoms or lump.  I had a repeat mammogram and then a core biopsy of  two areas they need to check out.  I had micro calcifications one 10mm and the other much smaller.  The Dr who told me I needed a biopsy said she 99.9% sure they were just calcifications.  The radiographers doing the biopsy made me think they were not so innocent as she asked the Dr if she wanted her to leave clips where she had taken the biopsy from.  I asked what the clips were and she said it was in case they came back to look at that area and they could easily pin  point where they had biopsied.  The Dr said no.  I had 6 samples taken from each area, so 12 in total and they commented when they had a \"good\" sample with calcification! A week later I had my results.  The larger area was DCIS intermediate grade, the smaller area was benign.  My treatment was a WLE (lumpectomy).  I asked them to remove both areas for peace of mind.  The surgeon said she could achieve a good cosmetic result by removing both areas as my breast were on the large size (I'm a 36/38 G).  I have a small scar, barely 1\" on top of my left boob and a small dent when I lift boob up. Following surgery they upgraded my DCIS to high grade but no invasive cells so treatment plan continued to 15 sessions of radio therapy.  I had been told if my lump had been positive for hormones then I would have had 5-10 years of drug therapy (it's good and bad that I didn't need drugs!!).  I did not require Chemo as it's not necessary for DCIS.  I had my first annual review the end of April and the mammogram should no areas of concern :) DCIS is early stage cancer and my surgeon did explain to me that some think it's over treatment to remove it and that it may never turn into fully blown cancer and they could just watch it.  However as mine was high grade I'm happy they treated it as it's the mostly likely to turn into invasive cancer. Do you know the size of area they are concerned about?  If you do get bad news then DCIS is the best of bad news!  Hopefully though you will get good news but ask them how often they intend to check that it remains as micro calcifications.  I do realise you would prefer to hear, it was all clear :) :) :)  but on this site you only tend to get the other side as that's why most remain posting on this site.  So for me saying it was DCIS there could be 100s out there who were told it's benign, but they don't post on here. Good luck for next week and let us know how you get on x",

I was looking for built in support T shirts for lounging and forgot about Bravisimo which someone on here recommended. I have a couple of stretchy step into bras that I bought from Sainsburys and I used them after a couple of weeks to sleep in plus when I had radiotherapy I wore under my normal underwired bra to stop any rubbing.  Depending on your surgery you may be advised not to use underwired bras but my BC nurse was okay with me wearing them as she said I needed the support!!!  She advised me to wear a bra to bed as she said the movement will pull on the scar without. I did try maternity and post surgery bras as they are incredibly soft inside (M&S, Asda, Debenhams) but my boobs are too round to fit into the cups but they might work for you The waiting for pathology results is awful and you might be surprised at how anxious you are feeling.  I felt anxious before surgery and was focused on \"surgery will be over soon\".  Then after a day or two it hits you that you are waiting again to find out next stage of treatment. I finished radiotherapy last tues and for last 2 days been house bound as I can't wear a bra  My skin held up really well all through rads but then on Friday I developed a rash and itching.  Aloe vera and anti histamine have seemed to calm it down. My advice would be to support breasts but also expose to the air for periods to aid healing.",

      "Content": "Come on now, your mother has accepted that until she has finished treatment she is living with cancer, not  dying from it. She has stage 1 which is the lowest stage so her prognosis is excellent.  She maybe outwardly showing she is calm but inside she might be paddling like mad but because you are not handling it well and she knew you wouldn't handle well so she can't lean on you.  Sorry but now is the time to step up to the mark and show her you can cope and can support her.  You've already started this process by attending an appointment with her so you can do it. When I was waiting for results of my biopsy I didn't want to tell my 20 year old daughter who was away at uni as I didn't want to upset her and I didn't want to have to deal with her upset while I was still in limbo and it might have all been for nothing.  When I was told that it was cancer and they started to outline the proposed treatment they remarked how calm I was but they didn't see me the moment I sat in my car!!!  That same day I drove to tell my daughter and we cried together, it was good to get it out.  The Breast care nurse came out to see us as a family 2 days later by which time we had all talked and had questions to ask.  It was so good to have this as my husband and daughter were so positive and supportive about my treatment and I didn't have to worry about how they were coping and that took so much pressure off me.  So sit and talk to your mother and if necessary cry together.  Get it out and then talk about how you are going to deal with it.  Use positive language with her about how she is going to get through this, remind her of the 90% 5 year survival rate for Breast cancer and how at stage 1 she's in an excellent position.  I had surgery and radiotherapy, no chemo so my treatment was done in less than 6 months.   I am back working full time and my only issue is fatigue but I'm fine apart from that.  Start with practicalities for your mother.  After surgery she may need different bra depending on her boob size, what sort of surgery  she has, where the scar is etc.  I am a G cup and I have a 1\" scar on top of my boob.  I had no nodes removed so could wear underwired again and as it was essential I had support so no pulling down on my scar this is what I did but for radiotherapy bigger boobs often come off worse with the skin underneath causing problems and underwired bras can rub skin that is a bit tender so I bought the stretchy step into bras to wear plus post surgery bras as they are soft cotton inside and normally have less seams to rub on skin. She will probably only be hospital for the day but if sent home shouldn't be alone for 24 hours so can she stay with you or you with her.  I remember feeling amazingly well the day after surgery but complete sh!t the following day.  Then the waiting began again for results of biopsy from surgery and I was very stressed as you are told  your treatment can change or you need further surgery depending on the results so try not to leave her alone with too much time to think.  You can and will do this.  Tell your children what is going on as they too can support their gran.  I so appreciated the support of my extended family and one of my nieces was amazing not only to me but to my daughter as well.",

I also had the pull up stretchy bras to just hold a non adhesive pad in place under breast when it was getting wet and smelly and I needed to ensure I didn't have skin on skin burns - only happens if you have big boobs! I only lived 5 mins drive from hospital so went to appts ready to go, braless and with the cotton top they gave me to use throughout my radiotherapy so no fussing with changing.",

I felt better once I knew my treatment plan as it was a busy time with appointments etc. and I wanted to get on with it. My daughter took the news very well.  Tears at first but then her sensible head on.  I had my first annual review last week and I was so stressed in the days before - it took me by surprise how awful I felt.  Thank fully all well.  It's always there hanging over you and if you have family or friends who have suffered with cancer make contact with them as they will be a great support as they understand completely how you feel.  I assume your daughter is an adult so I think she has to step up to the mark and support you and you need to stop worrying about her feeling and concentrate on  your treatment.   I didn't over share with my daughter but I didn't totally hide my stress and sometimes just told her \"I'm down\" or \"I'm scared\".  Sometimes just giving voice to your feelings helps. There is lots of support on this site if you need it  Good luck with your treatment xx",

There is no need to discredit \"cheap natural remedies\".  Most of us here are alive or will live much longer because of research done by pharmaceutical companies.  Modern medicine is amazing. Posted by Lavendergirl 17 Dec 2017 11:13 PM Shocking thread.  What I find odd is we talk about telling newly diagnosed  BC patients to only access credible sites, and not internetting Dr Google as there is so much scary information out there, and here we go with a lot of nonsense being posted.  It isn\u2019t really fair is it? I do think there should be a separate page McMillan puts up so that people who want to discuss this stuff can do can do so at their hearts content.  So let\u2019s be clear, lots of evidence about living healthily, eat well, exercise well, will basically keep you well.   Lots of evidence of women who have chosen alternative therapies to cure their breast cancer, I.e. drinking lemon or drinking plant based diets you will die. Sorry I know the first post was directed at me not sure if the second one is as it doesn't say who it's in reply to and for some reason I can't quote posts on here in my reply. As the thread is quite old I have been back and re-read it and I am very comfortable with my comments as I feel they are balanced and not promoting or discounting any treatment.  For those who do not wish to go and re-read the whole thread here are my two posts. I think the balance on this forum is excellent and people are free to post any question/thought that occurs to them without fear of ridicule or being jumped upon if it's considered controversial.  I can only recall on instance where I have seen offensive posting which was taken down quite promptly by moderates.   I will always remain open to the use of alternative therapies and do not judge those who choose this route, it's their choice.  For many people there are no conventional medicines out there.  I lost my sister to a brain tumour one month after she was diagnosed.  Brain tumour research receives just 1% of cancer research funding, survival rates have barely moved in 20 years.  When I knew what type of tumour my sister I googled.  The statistics for a GBM4 from official/unofficial sites was devastating.   I am not a mug and my daughter has a biomedical degree so if we could have found a therapy - I cannot use the word \"alternative\" as that would suggest there was a conventional treatment available but there wasn't so you can be sure we would have explored/researched it.   I continue to support Brain Tumour research as I feel this is the best hope for a viable treatment but I also read with interest the stories of those who have outlived their diagnosis, some by many years, who have made lifestyle changes and/or use supplements. We have to have people prepared to take a chance, they often do so knowing it won't work for them but that the outcomes may help future patients.   Posted by Grogg 12 Dec 2015 1:27 PM Sadly I do believe that Pharmaceutical companies would seek to discredit natural, cheap remedies as they have invested millions in developing treatments and need to sell them to recoup their investment. No doubt nature does provide a remedies to all manner of dreadful diseases that afflict the body and the internet can be a wonderful tool to discover some of these remedies.  However we are again at the mercy of people who will post false information just for the hell of it. There was an article yesterday that using an extract of cannabis helps to reduce seizures in children.  The trouble is how to parents who have children suffering with epilepsy find out how to access the drug.  Pharm companies will only develop if it's financially viable for them.

      "Content": "My BCN was/is wonderful.  From day 1 of her taking on my care after surgery she gave me a leaflet explaining her role and saying she was now my \"advocate\".  Anything I wanted I just had to ring her.  I did ring a few times and had her answerphone but she always rang me back same day and even if she answered me on phone would offer me the chance to go and see her -never later than the day after.  Everytime I saw her she offered moral support, she was always honest about what could happen but never in a scary, overwhelming way.  There is a second BCN attached to the unit and technically I wasn't her patient but my BCN told me if she was on leave the other one was available and in fact when my pathology results came through after surgery and my BCN was on leave for a couple of days the second BCN rang me late Friday afternoon to tell me them as my BCN had asked her to if they came though.  Such a small act but as they were good results it lifted me for the weekend. I was also given information about Maggie's centre where I could access other services if needed.  https://www.maggiescentres.org/our-centres/ You have been through so much and your BCN is there to support you so don't feel afraid to contact her again and ask her to direct you for counselling support.  You are not a nuisance and if she has an attitude problem that's her problem not yours.  I hope you get the support you need and best wishes for a lovely Christmas x",

Once you know what you are facing and treatment plan it will be easier because as you say the not knowing is awful. My first BCN didn't have much of a manner about her and told me I was too matter of fact in accepting my initial diagnosis.  I found her solemn voice quite off putting.  My second one who was attached to my surgeon was much nicer.  She was open and honest but positive.",

So if your surgeon leaning towards mastectomy is it because he thinks you will be lopsided after another lumpectomy rather than concern over type of cancer ?  ",

      "Content": "A few years ago my hubby had an interview for ESA.  My advice is take someone with you.  They will not be allowed to talk for you but a familiar face might help.  Do not feel  you have to put on an act - many people feel they need to say the positives as if to show they are not an incompetent idiot. You are recovering from a serious illness and it's okay to not be okay.  From memory they have a set of questions to assess how you function day to day like bathing, dressing, cooking, socialising, memory, following instructions, walking, driving.  Be honest.  Someone said you should tell them how you feel on your worse days if they are more prominent than good days but if you are genuinely unwell you shouldn't need to lie.  If you are struggling with their questions you can tell them they are overwhelming you, you can't think straight etc.  We were told their first question is always a trick question like when you walk in they say \"Hi how are you today\" knowing that British people typically respond with \"fine\" or \"Hi, did you find/get here alright\".  Can't remember if that happened.  When you arrive at reception they ask if you wish to claim travel expenses - so if you need to pay taxi/bus ask for receipt.  We never claimed as I drove so not sure if there is limit on what they pay. My husband had to go to appeal - turns out they had someone else's medical records mixed up with his. ",

Unlike my year 1 mammogram no results on the day, they will be sent to me.  However I'm paranoid it means something.  There were a few women there before me and some went into to see the Registrar after mammogram and some sent home. Then last night I had a dream that they told me I needed more surgery.  It's shaken me up because the day I had my results to years ago I had a dream that was so accurate. My dream was 5 people in a room and they told me I had one benign and one malignant area.  My results were exactly that and at one point there were 5 of us in the room (surgeon, nurse, sister, me and my hubby). Also is it normal to just have mammogram and no physical check. First year mammogram I then saw doctor and had physical exam.  This time just told to get dressed and go home.",

Roll forward 10 years and after first routine mammogram I was recalled.  I had early BC (DCIS) in left boob, no node involvement so had surgery and radiotherapy. So hard to second guess what your symptoms mean as once you notice them they become prominent in your mind. Good luck today.",

I focus on treatment has moved on so much in over 30 years and she had 20 good years after first diagnosis.  I didn't tell my daughter until I knew my diagnosis, I hid recall, biopsy etc from her as she was in Uni.  When I had diagnosis I drove the same day to tell her.  She said she was glad I ddi it face to face.  Your children are younger but I'm sure you will find the right way to tell them you are LIVING with cancer at the moment but the doctors are going to take it away.  90% of BC are cured, you will be in that 90% because you want to be.  Positive mental attitude will help you all so much .

I wore underwired bras after surgery but made sure they were cotton, soft and comfy.  I couldn't wear a bra for long a couple of weeks into radiotherapy as my skin was sore.  I did buy some soft post surgery bras but could only keep them on for a short period as everything irritated my irradiated skin!  I had the T shirt step into soft bras which were ok - not much support but a better than nothing.  If you have smallish boobs you will find it easier to find comfy non wired bra that give support.",
