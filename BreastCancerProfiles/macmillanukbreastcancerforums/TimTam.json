      "Content": "Dear Kath I felt very much the same after my first FEC. I felt like I had the worse hangover in the world for the first (maybe 3-4 days). Keep drinking lots of water. I was sleepy and lolled around. I really couldn't concentrate on anything. Just do what you can, when you can and listen to your body. My 2/3 FEC have been a lot better.",

I have experienced a kind of dry wrenching and wasn't sure at one stage if it was because I felt sick or from reflux. Stocked up on Gaviscon too. I think at your oncologist review you could ask about Emend which I believe is a stronger anti sickness drug if it becomes too much Take care",

      "Content": "Kim 46 I was dx 30/09/2013 at 39 years old and found out pretty immediately that I was negative on two counts of returning results. I had a Lumpectomy and sentinel lymph node removal and found no lymph nodes involved and clear margins. It was not until the 23rd of December and many appointments that I was able to pin down the last result of the test and YES I was also Triple Negative. I really don't know what I feel about being diagnosed of TN which sits within 15-20% of people with BC. I am aware of a high recurrence rate, but in my mind have put this down to the fact that there is no early detection and its very much down the individual to find it. Of course there are other factors. It is true that we are unable to take Herceptin or Tamoxifin for the next 5 years and therefore not having an additional safety net but feel that If it does recur I will then consider a mascectomy. I hope my ramblings make some sense. Good luck with the chemo - add me if you wish x I've just completed my 3rd cycle of FEC, 3 down and 3 to go.",

Normal side effects but started 4th cycle of FEC last Thursday and just got out of bed after two days of feeling quite out of it. I think my mind has clearly been playing tricks on me too. I had muscle ache in my neck, shoulders and side of my body and I felt like the light switch had been dimmed. My bloods have been above average all the way through so far. I have managed to get up today and had a shower and small walk, although it was shuffley baby steps. Anyone else felt like this?",

I will be back at work by then. I can't even express how upset I was as the services available in Shropshire bar a coffee morning or two is pretty poor.",

I was also given a box from the hospital to pop into the fridge, each injection in its own packet with no wipes. I had been through 2.5 weeks of self injecting my fertility drugs and so was trusted to do it myself. However I have a huge fear of needles and my husband has been given the task of injecting all injections into my stomach, each morning swopping from the left to the right.  As my husband leaves work just after 7, we have been getting up at 6:30 to take the injection out of the fridge to inject at 7am.  Yesterday I asked what would happen if we didnt take it out 30 mins before and maybe 5-10 minutes and the nurse said it would just sting. So we had an additional 20 mins in bed this morning and yes it did sting a little but then I like my sleep!!!! :)",
