      "Content": "Hi Penny From personal experience and what i've learnt I am not aware that weight loss is an indicator for this type of cancer. If you have been worried this could cause weight loss. Good luck with your appointment, the sooner this is investigated the better. Take care and let us know how you get on. Maureen x",

      "Content": "Hii Penny I was being treated for cysts and had needle aspiration and nothing untoward showed on the mammogram. The radiographer could see a dark patch on the ultrasound and did a core biopsy as a precaution. At the time I was comforted that it looked like innocent breast change and like one of the other ladies waited about ten days for the results with an appointment booked at the outpatients at my local hospital. Unfortunately in my case it was cancer and I really hadn't expected the news so I was poleaxed. The best advice I can give is to steel yourself for bad news and I hope and pray that it is good news and you'll be relieved. As others have said it is not a death sentence and breast cancer is treatable. From what you are saying if it turns out to be C then it would appear to be early and if it is small then treatment may not be as radical as you think. Try not to worry (its easier said than done I know). Good luck I'll be thinking of you and praying for a good outcome. Maureen x",
