Anyway with lots of nervy moments all in all my 20 sessions went ok, max time 15 minutes to less than 10 minutes each session. Radiographers would play music and talk to me during each session which helped me massively to relax. I remember my very last session and boy did I have a right old cry when it\u2019d finished Good luck Val",

      "Content": "I feel badly let down by friends and my sister.  They would ask how I was through my daughters or on bloody Facebook, which I don\u2019t use, but never to my face or over the phone. I felt, ffs !!!  I\u2019ve got breast cancer not a ruddy cold or infected limb.  Then through all treatment, which I\u2019ve now finished, nothing\u2019s changed. My sister lives 5 minutes away, I\u2019ve always helped her, financially, support, had her living with us too in the past. We used to shop regularly, even that stopped. We did though about a month ago. I picked her up and the drive to shopping centre was all about her, 30 minutes. My hubby told me to be light hearted as if nothing was wrong, but I was boiling up. We parked. Then went to costa. I went in to order and pay. Got coffees. Someone had to open the door for me as we were sitting outside, she sat there as I struggled. Anyway as we started to drink I said \u201coh by the way I\u2019m fine, thanks for asking\u201d.  Give me time she said. I\u2019ve seen her once since and that\u2019s because it was hubbys birthday. I feel so let down. So alone and uncared for by her and my friends.  I don\u2019t want sympathy but \u201c how are you feeling \u201c would be lovely to hear. I\u2019ve been told to forget it but it\u2019s something I can\u2019t forget nor forgive . They are selfish. Why should they be frightened, it\u2019s us that\u2019s going or have been through this crap. We didn\u2019t ask for it and I hope to god they never have to either So sorry but your post has touched my heart Love to us all, and I\u2019d like to ask you all \u201c how are you feeling \u201c,  it doesn\u2019t take much does it, 4 little words Val",

Because I was strong, pretty fit during treatments and just got on with it all, this I think led them to believe I was invincible.  Tomorrow is my granddaughter \u2018s birthday party. Other years my sister has hitched a lift with me. Not this year, haven\u2019t heard nothing. Today at work my daughter said my sister was going and helping out. Oh I said I\u2019ve heard nothing from her. Well my daughter said, have you texted her, yes I said I texted her last week, did she reply, I said yes. And she gave me one of her looks and then told me all of my sisters news. I feel, and now I\u2019m welling up, because I\u2019ve finished treatment theyve forgot it now and even my husband, whose been so supportive doesn\u2019t ask nor do 3 of my 4 grown up married kids.  Like you cancers not mentioned, wiped and hidden away but it\u2019s not for us. We remember a certain appointment,what happened, we remember our bodies being prodded and injected and feeling ill, so ill and sore and in pain.  I can\u2019t forget, I\u2019ve tried.  And all I want is for them to ask me how I\u2019m feeling, that\u2019s all. Im so so sorry for this long rant again everyone, maybe it\u2019s a form of healing, I don\u2019t know.   Sorry Val",

      "Content": "I know, I fell apart when during pre op assessment she told me that\u2019s where I\u2019d have to go.  Hospital where I had chemo was 15 minutes from where I live so that was ok. My gp prescribed the diazepam and oncologist okayed it as safe to take.  I had 4 x ec and my side effects were minimal too You can do it, love and best wishes  Val ",

      "Content": "Hi Little Boo Boo I was a nervous wreck, suffering from panic attacks for many many years, unable to travel more than 5 miles from home. Boy cancer diagnosis certainly healed me mentally and.  I went to my doctors prior to lumpectomy and got diazepam to take on day of operation, had to travel 40, that\u2019s right 40 miles to have the ratio active injection into boob, then travel back to Windsor for op. I did it. Then for chemo, again a diazepam before each session, my oncologist okayed it and that\u2019s how I got through 6 months of chemo, a 2mg tablet was my support. Haven\u2019t taken them since Best wishes  Val ",

      "Content": "I had EC too x 4, finished my chemo nearly 4 weeks ago, hooray ! I couldn't inject myself nor could my hubby, both wimps so Chemo nurse did it day after chemo.  The only side effects I had was joint pain in hip and base of spine.  Oncologist told me that was the bone marrow regenerating so just took paracetamols which helped, didn't go on for too long.  Hopefully you will be ok.  All the best",
