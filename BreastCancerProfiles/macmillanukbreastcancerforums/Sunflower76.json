      "Content": "Kaz18 Helsjw I am so sorry you are going through this.  The waiting at the beginning of the journey is the absolute worst. I was a mess waiting for those initial results. But once I had a plan and things started happening, it was a relief. Please try to stay off google. Come here, ask questions, look at breastcancercare.org.uk if you feel you need to. But not google. I did google and drove myself mad and went to a very dark place. It's easy to say, but difficult to do... Just try anything to take your mind off of it for now. But... easier said than done. I'm 42. I found a lump in May, had it removed in June, moved house in July, Radiotherapy in August, now on hormone tabs for 5 years. 4 months. It's like it never happened other than my lopsided boob and scar. Once you start working on getting rid of it, I'm sure things will feel a little more under control. It's still a roller-coaster. But doing is better than waiting. Be kind to yourselves... Be selfish.... Don't feel guilty about how you feel. Keep coming back to this forum as it is a god send. We are all in the same crappy boat, but paddling along together. I love my family and friends, but this is the place where my sanity was mostly kept in check. Take care and keep in touch. Good luck for MRI Kaz18, and don't freak out if they want to tape cod-liver oil tablets to your nipples. They don't always, but they did to me, and it was quite a shock. Also - take them off in the changing room afterwards. Don't forget. and get on the bus home, and wonder why people are looking at you strangely - like I did... Good luck Helsjw for the type etc.!

I was worried about posting this, but you guys have all made me feel more human again. jowoomot I will definitely have a look at that article by Peter Harvey  - thanks for reminding me. I know I saw a link on here but was waiting to read it because at the time I felt great. I know exactly what you mean about the \u2018recognition\u2019. Isn\u2019t it strange? I was so proud of myself for being so strong throughout the diagnosis, surgery and recovery. Everyone was saying how brave I was, but I didn\u2019t feel it - it was more like it was just another day but a little bit more going on. And at the time it was annoying to me that they thought I would fall apart. But here I am. Nearly at the end. And I think maybe I am falling apart. Meanwhile everyone has decided I\u2019m ok and moved on. One of the things I did in the early stages was read positive BC stories, and things that some people went on to achieve with their newer stronger selves. Taking the bull by the horns as it were and making the most of life. I took comfort that I would have an epiphany and things would change for the better and it would all be worth it. But I can\u2019t even stand the idea of getting my craft corner unpacked. I don\u2019t like my awesome job anymore. I\u2019ve still not done last night\u2019s dishes. I guess time heals and all that. In the mean time we can moan to eachother. And if you want someone to shout at, I\u2019m yer gal. I\u2019m sure a good rant helps from time to time! Hugs to all Dawn x",

      "Content": "Hello lovelies. I hope you treatments and recoveries are going well. My BC journey has been an 'easy' one. I found a lump in May. Had it and my nipple removed in June. No spread. No Chemo. RT starts on 9th August. I can start taking Tamoxifen any time now. I have been a VERY VERY lucky lady. And I know and appreciate that. But I find myself feeling restless and grumpy this week. A couple weeks ago we moved house. So that kept me busy. But now things are more settled and I am in limbo waiting for RT, I'm a pathetic unfocused unmotivated shadow. For no reason whatsoever. I'm like a little kid not getting their own way, but not knowing what they want. Work has been good thus far but are expecting more from me now. Physically I am fine. Mentally - this lack of focus/motivation is causing me issues. I keep playing with the idea of booking time off sick but that is such a cop out as there is nothing wrong with me. And I may need my sick time towards the end of RT or when I start Tamoxifen as I come to grips with any SE that I may end up with. Thing is - my inner child has reared her stupid entitled irrational head - I've only had time off for appointments and 2 days for the surgery - and my inner child is stomping her feet asking for some TLC as she as been so strong the last 3 months and she wants - well - who knows what she wants. She doesn't even know. Chocolate? A holiday? Sleep? An epiphany? Sorry to moan. I know I've been SO D@MN lucky. And I am normally a very rational and logical person. So this (hopefully temporary) new me is confusing and upsetting as I want to feel how I should feel. Relieved, happy and energised. Anyway. I ummed and ahhed about posting this. Then when my screen refreshed I accidentally left the group. So had to join again. So even the site is grumpy with me today. Sigh. Hugs to everyone. Dx",

We have his kids half the time, and their mum has them the other half. But his 17 year old girl doesn't always go back to her mums as they are always falling out. I have some pent up angst about that as I don't want her here all the time as I will have to keep my mask on all the time. So 50% works perfectly thanks. If she is here all the time through RT and the start of the dragon drugs, I may let loose. She has been warned Thanks again for the tips. I was thinking at night so any mood swings would be when everyone was asleep. But I like the idea of splitting them. And thanks for understanding.

Which is fine. But this cold is awful. Coughing, difficulty swallowing, the nasty green stuff (sorry). My BCN said it would be worth getting my chest checked by GP today, but seemed unconcerned. I'm worried that I'm going to cough and splutter on a ward with some very unwell people who do not need to be worse. Also about trying to recover with a cough.

The consultant had warned me that there was a chance they would need to go back and get more. But I was clear and no further surgery was required. I had to wait about two weeks for the results.

So basically, as I never specifically moisturised my boob before, I didn't for RT either. Just used dove soap. Didn't shave my underarm on the cancer side. I had no isses during the 15 sessions, that finished on 31st Aug. I'd say maybe five-ish days later, I was a bit pink. That's it. I will say, I'm 42. Never had sensitive skin. Don't tan well. Actually burn quite easily in the sun. But the best advice I had was from Leolady56. Who said you know your body best. Do what you think will work for your skin. She used lots of moisturisor and I think came through it well. DRINK LOTS OF WATER. The day of my first session I had a nurse talk me through it all. They said Aveeno if things got tough. And frozen peas. Haha. But I never needed it. I had breath hold so had to use facewipes to get the pen off where they drew all over me every day. I thought that would irritate the skin but it didn't. Good luck! Keep in touch",

They will be with me throughout the process apparently. Both are lovely. When I first walked in the room there were 4 people, and I thought. OMG. This is it. But one was bringing in a cuppa, the other was bringing in paperwork. So just Consultant and BCN for me. Those last two days before my initial diagnosis, I'd gone to a really really dark place. I'd stupidly been googling. Don't do that.. So I was prepared for the worst in some way I guess. But still... Don't Google! It's so out of date and misleading. But when I got my results I was almost happy, as the waiting was over and now we had a path to follow and plan to formulate. I'd intended to go in alone, but they encouraged me to bring someone so I dragged in my other half from the waiting room. It was nice to have him there in the end. I'm often stronger alone, but I liked having him there. The BCN went through everything again afterwards in a different room. Gave me lots of info I'd never thought to ask for. And contact numbers for any further questions. Good luck! And remember. Every reaction is ok. They've seen it all. Stunned silence to heaving sobs. Everyone is different. And every reaction is ok.

But then there will be a whirlwind of activity. Some recovery. Rinse and repeat. But in no time, you will look back and think 'crap - did I just do that?' And start to pick up the pieces and rebuild.And through it all - this place will be an oracle, a safe harbour, a friend, a reality check.  Thank you to macmillan for providing this place, thank you to YOU who give it soul. Merry Christmas.

Well - that annoyed me right off as I shave my legs and wash my hair every day normally. So I had a bottom half shower this morning, and then thought - I'll try to wash my hair bending forward (I have a hand held shower attachment). Anyway - it was a doddle. No drips to dressings (I kept on the post surgical bra they gave me to be really sure). No extra pain, CLEAN HAIR! I am soooo happy. The dressings look fully intact, but I was really careful. I hope you and jane304 have a great weekend. I'm looking forward to being treated to a nice homemade dinner, and sitting in the sunshine once it warms up a bit. Might even attempt to make some jewellery (my hobby).  TC Dx",

I did create and share a video on my personal page about checking for lumps, as it's annoying me that every time I ask friends and family if they have checked, they haven't - and you think they would - those that know about me anyway. Fools. But I've not been brave enough to be more (yet).  You are more than welcome to share any of them. This is the 'check yourself' one; Thanks again! Mwah X",

      "Content": "ali owl You're all so amazing and I don't know what I'd do without you. I was posting here a couple weeks ago, and my friend asked what I was doing. So I told her I was on the macmillan online community checking in to see how everyone was. She just launched into a speech about letting it go, moving on, not letting it define you. She laid into my new business idea (asymmetric jewellery to honour women with breast cancer, raise awareness, with charity donations etc). Now, I value her friendship, but there is a limit to what I will put up with. I've been ridiculously positive throughout my cancer to my friends and family, finding comfort here instead. I never even mention it voluntarily. So I told her, rather tetchily I'm afraid, that when I was first diagnosed all I looked for were the happy endings and positive inspirational people. Anything to grab onto some hope or understanding. So if I can make one woman smile or laugh or feel valued with my business or on facebook or here, then I will. And can she please keep her opinion to herself as I'm 100 times more positive and level than she is, cancer and all.  Oops Also, not sure where this rant came from! So much for positive and level. LOL. Anyway, I guess what I am saying is that you are all amazing and I love you. (Creepy?) Hehehe. X",

Have you considered a councillor? It might help, I know a lot of ladies here have seen one. If your're a hoarder that doesn't want to hoard, surely that is a massive step forward...? My mother is the total opposite, this past year she had both me and my step fathers depression to cope with. What did she do? Organise, throw stuff away. Re organise. Throw more stuff away. Too much as it turned out. It helped her deal with her anxiety. I don't know of that is similar to you, that it is anxiety driven, but knowing there is something to work on is a step in the right direction. If you can, and have the inclination, it certainly can't hurt to see if help is available. The mind website is also good. I know it's not the same thing, but I got lots of advice from there on how to try to communicate better with my step dad. Big hugs. X",

      "Content": "Easter is a good time to reflections and new beginnings. And whilst this image is inspired by the Japanese art of kintsugi, I feel it is still appropriate. Kintsugi - meaning 'golden seams' - is the repair of a broken object with gold powder, emphasising its scars as as part of its history. Showing that nothing is ever truly broken and that there is strength and beauty in imperfection. So I say this to you, even though it can be really hard, embrace your scars - physical or mental. They are what make you who you are today. Even if you feel less or broken. These cracks will heal in their own way. You may not be who you were yesterday - but you are still you. The pain of grief is a sign of the love you have had in your life. Remember those precious happy moments. The pain of fear is a sign of what you have now that you do not want to lose. Appreciate every day, even if just one small moment. So please take a moment to reflect on where you are today and how much you have been through. How strong you have been to get to this moment in time. How flawed and beautiful and tragic and amazing life is and you are. Remember that you love and have been loved. Scars and all. Happy Easter friends.",

      "Content": "Oh XjulieX, I totally second what LondonLass says. You don't need a kick. You need a giant frickin bear bug and some cake. I've got 2 days left of RT, been emotionally fine for 99% of this whole journey. But I fully expect to be where you are in a few weeks. SO please don't worry that it's wrong or weird. Like LondonLass said, some of it will be brought on by the Taxoxifen. Some of it will just be a natural reaction to everything.  Maybe I can cheer you up - however briefly - with a little Tamoxifen story of my own. I've not been on it long. But the first week was great. I felt fine. No SE. As a matter of fact, the further into the week it got, the happier I got. Life was good. Over the bank holiday weekend I got up early for my morning walk and practically skipped out of the house. Then..... Wait for it.... I trod on a snail.... Yup. Squished the poor little thing dead. Normally - I would be momentarily sad, say sorry, and skip off. But nooooo. Not that day. That day I cried and was inconsolable for like 5 minutes. (I haven't even cried over breast cancer, but that poor little snail! Awwwww). Anywhoo. I started back home crying and sniffing (no tissue). And this woman with a dog sees me and comes over to ask if I'm ok. Which set me off more. Then she's like \"what happened? Can I do anything for you\". Bless her. And I think to myself. How can I tell this lovely concerned woman about the snail. She'll think I'm insane. And then that sets me off laughing. So now I'm crying and laughing and snotting in front of this poor woman. I can feel the mood change from concern for me to concern for her. And I know I have to say something. So I said... Wait for it... Wait for it.... \"It's ok, it's just the drugs\". Which of course - out of context, must have been somewhat alarming for her. I gave up and went home. Needless to say, I have gone the same route at the same time the last few days to see if I could bump into her and try to explain and say thanks and sorry. But I've not seen her. I fear that she may have decided to move house. So the moral of the story? Watch your step, be kind to yourself, eat cake, come see us on this forum. Hugs and snotty giggles Dawn x",
