      "Content": "Hi Emma, I'm a Fit Advisor for Triumph, hopefully I can help. Being as prepared as possible is a great attitude and no questions are daft! Firstly, you don't always need a specialised mastectomy bra; there are plenty of soft, non-wired or sports bras that can work for you. For the weeks following your surgery you should wear whatever is comfortable - a front-fastening non-wired or sports bra in your normal size is fine, so long as the underband is not too tight and there is no digging in to the tissue whatsoever. Once you have started recovery and the tissue is healing (usually six weeks post-surgery) I'd recommend you go for a bra fitting before being fit for the prosthesis, in order for the hospital staff to correctly assess your prosthesis size. You will still need to be in a non-wired bra in a comfortable fabric until the scarring has healed and the swelling has gone down, which can take anywhere from six to eighteen months, depending on your own healing process. The new bra should also be fit to the natural breast and the prosthesis fit to this size. The things to look for are: A non-wired style in a comfortable fabric. Deep wings to avoid any pressure on the scars and to secure the prosthesis. A full cup with a deep centre front (no plunge styles!). A stretch frame for comfort and flexibility. Avoid underwires, especially after your reconstruction as the reconstructed breast could take on the shape of the underwire, and avoid seam-free cups as they can leave a puckering around the nipple area. Best of luck for your surgery and for a smooth recovery. Best wishes, Rachel (Triumph Fit Advisor)",

      "Content": "Hi George, Jackie, We do have a number of bras suitable for post-operative wear, that are comfortable with or without a prosthetic. We do always recommend having a fitting in person with a trained Mastectomy fitter, as every woman fits differently and has different requirements. If you're a smaller cup size, A-D, then the non-wired bra of our best-selling range, Amourette 300, is a good choice. It's an all-over stretch lace with very comfortable, adjustable straps. Amourette 300N http://bit.ly/1k94ZKw Or for larger cups, the non-wired Doreen is great Doreen N http://bit.ly/1k953tK You can also try out a sports bra which many women find more comfortable; I would recommend our Workout range. Triaction Workout N http://bit.ly/1k95bJO Feel free to get in touch if you have any more questions or you'd like any fitting info and I can get back to you in a couple of days. Best wishes, Rachel",
