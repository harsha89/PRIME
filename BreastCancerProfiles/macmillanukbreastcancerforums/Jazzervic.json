    "Content": "Hi Jane, the replies on here I am sure have given you a great insight and have also been helpful to me so thank you. Please do not think I am being negative with my post but I did just want to say that this reconstruction is amazing as I was in the same situation as you and was the route they were guiding me down, as I am young and definitely the boob is more natural and will grow with you as you age and be less likely for your body to reject it. I got to meet a lovely lady who had had it done and was fab to see the boob and stomach scar and how well it heals. Now all I want to say is I had my chemo first and it ended up that I was actually not strong enough to have the DIEP immediately as the chemo had wiped my reserve energy levels. So I have had a mastectomy with the plan to have the DIEP in 6 months onwards when I am stronger. So yes the DIEP looks great but a huge operation, so just keep in mind that you might not be quite strong enough after chemo. I really hope you are though. I just wish someone had told me that I might not have had it immediately as my heart was set on it. But hey there's a reason my journey was guided that. All my love for your chemo - you can do it!! Just keep smiling and remember if you feel under the weather at times at least your cancer is feeling 100 times worse Xxxxx",
