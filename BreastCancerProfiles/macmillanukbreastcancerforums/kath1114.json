      "Content": "Hi Nauticalannie I wrote an earlier post regarding a rash I associated with Docetaxol chemo, I have had my 5th chemo and 2nd Docetaxol on 4rh August, within 8 days a rash very similar to a bad burn appeared on my injection hand about 1/2\" away from the needle entry point.  The last time the rash appeared on my cheeks and I think I have avoided this happening again by plastering E45 cream over my face (still waiting for the spots to appear with all this grease).  My hands are very dry and I am continually moisturising them, now using E45 on them also.  I wonder where the rash will appear on my last chemo due on 25th Aug? Sorry to hear about your pains from the chemo, I found the 1st Docetaxol was worse but did get pains for about 4 days which I kept under control with Diclofenic.  The worst symptom all through this for me has been the horrible taste in my mouth where everything especially water tastes so foul, this symptom appears to last for the two weeks after the chemo then tails off.  The constipation I dealt with by eating lots of licorice and taking a senocot every night, but then ended up with diarrohea (not quite as bad but restricts you getting about). Good luck with your next treatments. Kath ",

      "Content": "Hi Pez I too appeared to have a skin reaction from Docetaxel.  About 10 days after my 1st dose  (my treatment is 3 x FEC and 3 x Docetaxel) my cheeks went bright red and burning hot from the bottom of my eyes to under my chin.  I thought it was a reaction to some vitamin tablets I had taken for skin, nails and hair, and after about 3 days went to see the chemo nurses as by phone they were suggesting piriton which did not work.  They believed it was a severe reaction to the sun, which was strange as I had avoided this like the plague.  I was prescribed 50+ sunscreen and used this every day.  I also noticed my cheeks were getting very dry and flaky so I used lots of E45 cream on them, after about 2 more days this reaction went away.  Now I have read your post, I think it was probably the chemo, even though the nurses said a reaction would have happened straight away not after 10 days.    I have had my second Docetaxol on 4 August and are waiting to see if it happens again. Thanks",

      "Content": "Hi, I had all my lymph nodes removed during surgery in late March. I attempted to drive a week after the drain was out but struggled a bit with the forward gears, especially fifth as it was a further reach and needed somebody else to pull the handbrake fully on and off for me. Things improved and after another couple of weeks I could manage without help. I still have lack of feeling at the back of my arm and in the armpit, actually I have a mole there and plan to have it removed whilst it feels dead but waiting until radiotherapy is finished in early November. I was told that this dead feeling is due to nerves being cut through in surgery and will recover but very slowly, they said 1/4\" every six months regrows, hope this is true. Actually I have got quite used to it now. It is strange spraying deodorant under there because I cannot feel if it has gone on. At the moment I am not allowed to use deodorant under that arm due to radiotherapy. Good luck with chemo and radiotherapy. Kath",
