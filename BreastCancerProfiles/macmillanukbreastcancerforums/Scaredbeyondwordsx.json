      "Content": "Honestly thank you ever so much for taking the time to reply! It means so much. I really do feel a mess, I\u2019ve never been through something so hard my entire life, I can\u2019t seem to cope :( I have googled, a big mistake I know but I couldn\u2019t help myself I wish I never, but it made me aware that the ibc I fear so much can\u2019t always be seen on an ultrasound and I feel like no Dr can tell me what this is which makes it worth, I\u2019ve totally lost faith in Drs if I\u2019m honest, I\u2019ve even paid £250 private just to keep being told the same but with no reason as to what\u2019s causing it. I\u2019ve offered to pay for further testing I\u2019ll literally do anything just to know :( the sooner it\u2019s caught if it\u2019s something serious the more chance I have, my son needs his mum :( it\u2019s breaking my heart. I\u2019ve had people come with me it doesn\u2019t change it, I\u2019ve gone back to my Gp today and have been referred to the breast clinic again as my symptoms are worse, but I bet it\u2019ll be the same thing again:( how can they not see how worse it\u2019s getting. I just want it sorted. Honestly your response means so much to me! Thank you again. I hope you\u2019re okay. Sending love xx",

      "Content": "Hello everyone.. feeling lost and so low, I can\u2019t stop crying my breast is getting worse and I feel like doctors are just misdiagnosing me, my breast now ontop of all the pain has a rash on top and a few spots around the breast, I can barely move out of bed, my armpit and shoulder are in pain to, I\u2019ve had 2 ultrasounds and been told I have dense breast tissue in that breast but I know how easily ultrasounds miss imflammatory breast cancer, no pain relief is helping and everyday I feel even more unwell, I\u2019m looking online constantly (I know I shouldn\u2019t) at survival rates and now I\u2019m in my own head planning my funeral, I\u2019m so sorry to anyone who\u2019s going through this type of cancer if I\u2019m coming across rude without an actual diagnosis but I believe myself that I have it, I don\u2019t know where else to go or what else to do, I feel weak I can barely get out of bed, all I want to do is cry. I keep pushing everyone around me away, everyone thinks I\u2019m overreacting but the proof is right there on my breast, my veins are prominent, it\u2019s so painful and itchy, I can\u2019t even make sense of myself right now. I feel so unwell, I feel drained in every way possible and I don\u2019t know if just leaving myself here to suffer is my only option now. I just want help and a diagnosis that is it, it\u2019s been half a year now and it\u2019s getting worse. What do I do ",

I will be taking someone with me but I\u2019ve done that before and it doesn\u2019t seem to help :( I\u2019m honestly lost at this point and I\u2019m not sure what to do, it\u2019s horrible when you feel no one believes you yet you\u2019re left in despair in so much pain.

I\u2019m just pushing and pushing I just want a biopsy if I\u2019m honest, I know that\u2019s the only way to diagnose. I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re experiencing similar symptoms, it\u2019s honestly horrible isn\u2019t it.
