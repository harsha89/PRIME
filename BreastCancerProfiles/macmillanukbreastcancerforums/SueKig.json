      "Content": "Hello. I am having 3FEC then 3Tax. After the first dose of taxotere I had a very bad reaction so onc has put me back on FEC for the final two. Now my nails are lifting off the base and I'm worried I might get an infection and end up in hospital as I only had a dose of chemo on Friday. Was hoping I would avoid this horrible side effect with only one dose. Anyone any tips of how to look after nails when this happens to stop any infection, and how to care for them until the nail grows back.  The loosest two have plasters on at the moment but think I will lose them all. I have always looked after my nails and worn gloves etc. Thanks in advance for any advice.",

Mine was after a toxic first dose on taxotere, cant crack an egg now or walk properly as no feeling in toes, it makes you feel disabled.it helps knowing we aren't alone.x",
