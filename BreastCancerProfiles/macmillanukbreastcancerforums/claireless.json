    "Content": "  Inflammatory breast cancer question? Hi I was wondering if anyone could help me with a question. My mum has IBC with the HER 2 receptor. She has has lymph nodes removed, full mastectomy, chemo beforehand, Radiotherapy and was having Herceptin. On March 12th 2012 she was given the all clear from MRI, CAT scans and a mammogram. On the 18th March 2012 she spoke to me telling me that she thought she had flu, felt a bit run down etc. On the 20th March 2012 my dad phoned to say that her temp was sky high falling to down low, she was shaking uncontrollably and that she couldn't physically move :/ She was in terrible pain for 2 days even with doctors visits!! On the 3rd day my dad phoned her Cancer care consultants and they ordered an emergency ambulance and she was admitted to hospital after a 2hr and 7 shots of morphine experience trying to get her into the ambulance. Finally after 2 days in hospital she was diagnosed with Septicemia and we have since been told she was 24hr's away from dying! The upshot is my mum has been left with terrible pain in her leg and has gone from a fit and active lady to needing a frame/walking stick to get about!! She has since seen her cancer care people and they have said the resulting leg pain/mobility is nothing to do with the Septicemia and she has ( 2 weeks ago) had an MRI, CAT, Bone scans and we are awaiting the results. What I would like to know is, everything points to this being Metastic spinal bone compression ( pain worse at night, she wakes up crying so bad my poor dad hates it! Constipation, unsure of when she needs to pee, pain started like a band of pain higher up her back and obviously lack of mobility in her leg ) Could it be that the Septicemia diagnosis has gotten in the way of seeing the bigger picture...IE Could my mums Cancer already spread to the spine/back/leg area and the infection ( septicemia ) was a warning sign. If anyone has any experience of this kind of infection and the health conditions associated with either bone cancer or septicemia could you please let me know as my whole family are at our wits end. Thank you in advance and sorry for the essay :-) ♥ xx",
