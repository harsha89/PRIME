      "Content": "Snowys Mum I like your metaphor - I really do feel like I need a lifeboat right now. It really helps to connect with others who know how it feels to be in this position.  The lady who did my ultrasound told me she thought I might have lobular (I think that's the correct term) bc. I've looked it up and it seems that's not the 'best' type to have. I'm in a constant battle with myself not to google because as soon as I do I feel helpless and horribly scared.  Thank you for your message - honestly it is helping so much to speak to people on here xx",

Well it's a lovely sunny day so I will try and distract myself. I don't usually say this but I would rather be at work! Anyway thank you so much for your message - and the tutorial! Your support is really appreciated xx",

      "Content": "I posted yesterday to say I was told on Thu I had breast cancer and that I go back on Friday for my biopsy results and to find out my plan.  Since then I have felt incredibly physically sick and I basically feel like I've got aches and pains everywhere! It's crazy really as I went in there feeling fine and came out feeling like I'm really poorly. Has anyone else experienced this?  I'm really struggling to keep it together mentally. Thank you for listening. Also I tried to reply to everyone who posted on my last post but my replies didn't seem to appear under the relevant comments so apologies - I haven't got the hang of how this forum works yet x",

      "Content": "So I have just over 24 hours now til my apt on Friday afternoon. I had a routine docs apt yesterday (for my repeat prescription for bp meds) and she was really lovely and chatted to me about things.  She said it was really good news that they hadn't been able to find anything in my armpit as she thought due to the position of the lump that would be the first place it would spread to. She also prescribed me some valium just enough to get me through the apt.  In the meantime being at work is helping so much.  Hope everyone else is doing ok.  xxx",
