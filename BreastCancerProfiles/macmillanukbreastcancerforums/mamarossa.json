    "Content": "Hi, I was diagnosed with dcis in my right breast covering a wide area in July, had a lumpectomy at the end of September, clear margins but 4mm of pr/er negative, her2 positive idc and had a sentinel node biopsy on 9th November which was clear. I was in a car crash earlier today, turning left on a roundabout and a car came out from one of the entrances on my left and rammed full into my passenger door  and then drove on again into my car again, bashing the side sliding door badly. My mum and aunt (both in their 70s) were in the car, as well as my daughter and 2 of my sons (who both have haemophilia). They all seem fine just now although we'll know better in the morning. I felt fine at first but after a few hours started getting a lot of pain in my lower back and ribs, right around to the front of my ribcage and under my left breast, along my bra line. I also had a heavy feeling in my left arm with tingling in my fingers which painkillers has helped. The area along the bra line is also sore to touch so I'm not sure if I banged it off the steering wheel or if its  due to the seatbelt. I have pain across my right shoulder but not on or under the breast at that side as its still very numb since my op so I can't tell if I banged that side off the steering wheel or the seatbelt. As I'm a haemophilia carrier I can take a bit longer to clot so bruises can takes ages to show up so that's not much of a guide. I phoned 111 for advice at 9pm but they didn't return my call until 1am. They said I have to go to A&e since it's only 5 weeks since my lymph node surgery. I'm exhausted and too sore to drive myself all the way to the hospital to wait for hours there tonight(my husband would have to stay at home with the kids) but plan to go as soon as we drop the kids at school tomorrow when he can drive me. I'm worried about the chance of lymphedema if I have hurt that side but am I right in thinking the risk is no different if I go tonight or tomorrow? I'm due to start radiation on Tuesday (19th) and I'm dreading how sore I'm going to be.  Thanks, Angela",
