      "Content": "Hi Russ Just after a bit of advice. My wife had been referred for breast cancer assessment after finding a lump and we are there on Friday. I understand that some hospitals are set up for giving results on the day after the \"triple assessment\" and was wondering if Derby is one of these? If not how long do you have to wait for results?  Thanks Nick",
