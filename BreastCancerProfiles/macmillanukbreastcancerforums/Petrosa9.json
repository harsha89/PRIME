      "Content": "Hi there, I had my lumpectomy and sentinel node removal about a month ago now and had been really worried about my healing.  I had a drain for a few days which wasn't very comfortable, but I coped.  I'm also a diabetic on insulin.  I had been advised to start exercises the day after and to do them 3xtimes a day.....which I did.  I've healed really well....even surprised the medical team with how well. Do them slowly and within your pain limits. Waiting to start chemo next week now. Good luck X",

      "Content": "Hi Helen, Thank you very much.  Yes the site and the ladies on here are amazing..... I'm taking a leaf out of everyone's response and other threads to hold on tight.... The waiting is horrible but reading everyone's threads has helped with some of the anxiety.  Knowing that you aren't the only one going through this crap really really helps..... Definitely the club that no one wanted to join.  Lots of hugs and love to all X",

      "Content": "Hello all, I've been reading most people's post and am amazed by all the people on here.  I know that we can get through this from reading all your posts but I still can't help but be worried and stressed out. I was diagnosed last month.... 1month exactly before my 40th birthday.  At that time we were informed that the tumour was 1cm and a grade 3.  I wasn't overly worried as I thought that we had caught it early and we will get through this.  After my lumpectomy about 2 weeks ago we find out that the tumour was actually 2.7cm with 2 cm of pre cancerous cells and that my sentinel node biopsy showed that they had cancer cells in them.  I was offered the removal of all my arm lypmh nodes and then chemo or vice versa.  I have chosen to do chemo first then surgery as I'm terrified that it may have spread.  My mum died aged 46 of stage 4 lung cancer which hadn't been caught until 3 months before she had passed on.  My husband is beside himself and is finding all this tough to deal with as his mum had died of stage 4 bowel cancer.... Again not picked up until 2 months before she died. We have a little girl who is turning 2 next Wednesday and we are just so stressed out.  We had been trying for baby number 2 but have had to accept that this isn't an option now.....which devasted me more than the diagnosis of BC.  Finding that the C has spread to the nodes has now finally scared me..... I seem to wake up at 2am and then can't sleep until about 6ish. Im awaiting my CT scan and first consult with the oncologist....to be fair I'm not even sure why I'm posting lol.  I guess I'm looking for some reassurance that even with all this there is light at the end of the tunnel.  Everyone keeps telling me to stay positive and you will defeat this but at 2am when I'm alone with the night it's hard to be positive.  The worst is when someone says oh it's just breast cancer, it's curable nowadays so don't worry!  Well they aren't the one who is being cut up and going through the chemo so this blasé attitude really angers me. Thanks for reading my ranting and moaning, Hugs to all X",

      "Content": "Thank you both very much for the response.... I really appreciate it. So far our local NHS has been brilliant(Solihull)...... Oncologist appt 1 Feb and CT scan 9 Feb.... So not too long to wait..... The thing is I still haven't had a good old cry just yet....the past 2 days, once I drop my baby at nursery and I'm home alone, I've hours just sitting and staring off into space and thinking.....yet sleepy then I realise it's been 3 hours!  It's seems like my body just shuts off and my brain gets fuzzy.  I think that I'm just a bit overwhelmed emotionally.  Rationally I'm taking it all in but emotionally I'm being a bit slower.  Perversely I'm waiting for a good old cry lol..... It's a release but so far it's been a few tears and a rant. Thanks for the sharing....that helps immensely X",
