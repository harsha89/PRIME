      "Content": "Hi Anne Thanks for the reply. It is good to talk to someone who has had reconstruction. as yet I have only met people who have opted not to have it. Reading the booklet the hospital gave me it just sounds so gorey and I was shocked that they asked me what I wanted to have when i  just want whatever they think is best for my body whilst getting rid of all those 'changing cells'. Having had 2 ops since June the thought of yet another is driving me crazy.My main question is what people feel re a pedicule or free flap. All the best with your op next week. can't wait until I am at that stage. Best wishes Sue xx",

      "Content": "Hi I am Sue .I have been reading all the posts with interest. I had 2 lots of DCIS in left breast. I then had segmentopy to remove them along with a sentinal lymph node biopsy. That came back clear but there was not enough clearance around the other cells. So I had op no 2.The results of this came back as changing cells so last thursday i was told that I have to have a mastectomy. They have offered reconstruction at the same time which i have decided to have but I feel completely terrified at which kind of flap to have.....the literature on the various techniques is so heavy and they seem to want me to say what kind I want.I know it will need to be from my stomach but which kind? My mind is going mad at the thought of op no 3 it just seems to fill every thought.Can anyone out there let me know their experiences of reconstruction and what kind they had.",
