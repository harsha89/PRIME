They will also remove my lymph nodes as they were affected.  I keep reading posts about women having sentinal node biopsy along with their surgery. What is this? I don't want to google and stumble onto something nasty just before my surgery but would like to know what this is. When I first had my biopsy of the breast they also did a biopsy in the under arms as I felt a lump there as well. Is this sentinal node biopsy?  Thanks R. ",

I called them after a week to ask for the results. That's when I was told that it is definitely cancer that's come back. It's only in the spine and nowhere else. Since the bone is weak they have sent my case to the National ortho hospital who will decide if I need surgery. I will meet the oncologist after he has heard from the ortho specialists. For now all I can do is wait and wait some more. This is the worst time when your mind thinks of all possible negative outcomes!!  I had ER+PR+ HER2-ve.  I was on tamoxifen.  How did it come back within a year is beyond my understanding. Well somethings in life don't have any explanations I suppose.  R. ",

My medication has been changed to Letrozol. I've also been prescribed calcium and Vitamin D pills. I will be having a bone strengthening infusion once a month forever! I am also being part of a trial where in I will be scanned every 12 weeks. I've been told that since this is a secondary cancer they cannot cure it but can only keep it under control. I read about this prior to seeing the onco but when he actually said this I was very upset and almost broke down. But I suppose this is the best I can get.  My emotions are very mixed at the moment. At times I feel very positive but at times I am a complete wreck.  R. ",

Had a bone scan, MRI and  CT which shows that cancer is back in my spine!! I am so worried. I am going to meet the oncologist on Friday to discuss the treatment options. Has anyone had the same? Is this considered stage 4? Is this metastasis? I am being told that I might need surgery as the bone in that area has become weak. Anyone knows what type of surgery this is?  I was so positive since I finished treatment the first time. I am 34 and I thought I would at least  be fine for a while!!

Am alright as long as I dont change my position. But every time I change my position I feel the pain and feel a weight pulling down my chest. Any one experienced this?  I am tired of it already.

Do I want to have it along with the mastectomy or at a later stage. Both options seem to have their own pros and cons. Can people who have had it either way please tell me about their experience? I feel I don't want to have two surgeries but at the same time I don't want the radiation to cause any damage to my new breast.  Thanks Ramya. ",

I went to the hospital with breast abnormality in 2013 but after an ultrasound I was told it is a benign condition and I needn't worry. But in Dec 2014,when the symptoms continued and the pain got unbearable I went again and this time I was diagnosed with BC. I am pretty sure it must have been cancer that went undiagnised. However, I have finished my chemo and surgery now and the cancer has been removed completely. I am even considering returning to work in a couple of months.  It doesn't matter if its been there for a long time.  Also, its never easy when you hear the news for the first time.

Last Dec, My Oncologist prescribed oophorectomy, referred me to a Gynaecologist and until the procedure happens, I was prescribed injections every 4 weeks to prevent my periods recurring. I have been having this injection since Dec.  We met the Gynaecologist in March and I was put on the waiting list for this procedure. I don't know when I will undergo this procedure. My husband's job is going to take us away from this country in July and I want to get the procedure done before that. Since we have private medical cover through his company, we are wondering if we should go private to get this done. When we consulted the insurance, they said that the procedure will be covered only it is required due to an acute medical condition. They were vague about what an acute medical condition means, but suggested that we meet a private gynaecologist who can tell the insurance why this procedure is required. The insurance will then tell us how to go about it. Has anyone been in this situation before ? We are concerned about the wait for this procedure and not sure about the insurance cover. Any advise or suggestions appreciated. R",
