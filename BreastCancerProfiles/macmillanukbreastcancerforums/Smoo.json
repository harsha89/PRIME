      "Content": "Hi Dot So sorry to hear your news ...but you sound so strong and absolutely we will get through this. I will be here for you every step of the way.  Its weird ...and not sure if you feel like this ..but everything seems really surreal. I just cant fathom that I have cancer.   I go in for my op on 26th January. 10 hour op, week in hospital , 2 month recovery. my 50th birthday will be spent in bed. !!! I wish I could cry. I think its really good you are crying loads. I feel very shut off ..which I dont think is good.  This site really helps ..your message made me feel so much better. as though I am not alone. 2018 will be a good year. we will beat cancer.  sending you lots of love.

      "Content": "Thanks for your kind words.  I agree - Xmas is a pain when you are waiting to get on with things and get treatment underway.  I have my op and reconstruction on 26th Jan.  Feels like this big weight on me all the time - knowing I need to get it done - there is no choice, but terrified of the changes to me both physically and emotionally.  Its tough - really tough.  At work today and my mind keeps drifting off.  They will be doing a sentinel node biopsy and I think I am more anxious about that than anything else.  They don't think the cancer has spread, but they don't know for sure.  Still one step at a time. Lots of love to all Sue xx",

      "Content": "Morning Erica I noticed a change in my nipple in April 2017. went to see consultant who was not concerned.  in October it was worse.  so i was fast tracked with nhs. turns out i had pagets disease of the nipple with a cancer in the breast which they dont think has spread.  the operation was not easy not going to lie. but you will feel better quite quickly. also if they are removing the breasts without reconstruction think it might be easier.  for you it's the emotional side of not having breasts. but listen ..you can wear prosthesis . or not as you feel.  and the important thing is the cancer will be gone. talk ...talk . talk .. so important to have support.  lots of love Sue xxxx",

All of a sudden today I feel as though I have been hit by a bulldozer.  I am at work - I can't think straight, want to burst into tears, feel absolutely terrified. Is this all normal?  I feel as though I am going mad.  Its horrendous. Anyone out there that can help me feel normal again? xxx",
