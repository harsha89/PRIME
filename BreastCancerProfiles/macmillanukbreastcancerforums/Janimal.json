    "Content": "Hi there, Ive just had a lumpectomy too and 4 lymph nodes on 29th May.  The waiting for the news is by far the worst.  Fortunately I got the news there is no cancer in my lymph nodes and a good margin has been taken in my left breast.   Once again I find myself waiting again...for the letter giving me the date for my first session of radiotherapy.   Good luck with your treatment",
