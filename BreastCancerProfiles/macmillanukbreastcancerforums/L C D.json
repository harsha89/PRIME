      "Content": "Hi, i am hoping someone may be able to help me find the words to explain to my family how awful they are being to me, or if you agree with them please tell me why. Im 50, always been single and until 3 years ago worked as a professional and was earning a good amount. I started off with an underactive thyroid. i was undermedicated for the first 9 months and ended up suicidal. it then took another 7 months to start feeling a bit better. then i had a major operation and then i was diognosed with cancer and started on Letrozol. All of these has left me with things such as chronic mental and phisical fatigue, depression and a lot of pain. ive now also got golfers elbow in both arms . Ive been trying to get my house ready to sell but after 3 years of doing very little i have so much stuff to sort and get rid of etc which takes forever when your ill. My family have helped a bit with the decorating, garden etc but it seems this help comes with conditions. they tell me what needs doing, my mum continualy went on about cutting the plants back in my garden as there are bamboos etc. For instance,  i dont want them cut back as i love the garden, but my mum and daughter   kept on for months. I painted my stairs and put stair trends down, they complianed saying it didnt need to be done. In the past i have always enjoyed decorating and making things, something i have not done for 3 years. More recently i found really lovely spray paint that doesnt need the wood sanding. i started spraying things around the house, like baskets, tins and my kitchen table etc etc,  which i really enjoyed. However when ive complained to my daughter and son at their lack of help ( my daughter has been to my house about 8 times in the last 5 months,  all they have done is moan at me for doing the spraying and making more to do. i explained that they should be pleased im doing something i enjoy and that i dont go out socialising so to let me be. the responce was that it would be better to go out than spraying things. I wanted my bathroom painted but was told it didnt need doing. i have sold 7 houses at top prices for the area so i think i know what im doing !. the pain of them adding to my disempowerment and loss of autonomy is making me cry more than the illness. i feel good and then they have their two pennys worth and i just want to stay in bed and cry. i feel like i just want to run away and never see them again. Am i wrong ? ",

      "Content": "Hi, thanks for the message. im looking for some advice on Letrozol but i had endometrial cancer. i wondered what womens expereance was when they stopped taking it. i stopped about 6 weeks ago after 9 months as the effects were so debilitating. thanksfully im low risk. I seemed to feel worse for most of that time, then a few nights back i had 2 full days of mad crazy energy and spent 2 days and nights giving the house a good clean and sorting things out. i had no sleep whatsoever ( i have been ill for 3 years so the house etc has been very neglected which has driven me crazy !) ",
