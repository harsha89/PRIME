      "Content": "I was talking to the husband of another breast cancer patient this week. He is a doctor, his wife was the same as me, HER2+, her's has metastasized to her lungs and bones, he said that was the case with up to 70%of HER2+ cancers. Not sure if I missed this, or I have just forgotten that fact! Also, it isn't curable, just controllable. I am going to try to make an appointment this week to talk with my breast nurse!",

      "Content": "Hi Granny59 Thank you for answering me :-) I guess I don't need to go back to work, but during the last 5 months at home I have decided I'm not cut out for a life of leisure! Even though at times I've felt very tired and knew I couldn't cope with work, I have missed it. You can only do so much housework! I have seen some struggle to get back to the \"old\" routine at work something has changed, I know I have, I feel much stronger mentally than I ever have! Love and hugs Helen xoxox",

      "Content": "Hi All and a Happy New Year I had my lumpectomy and axillary node clearance on 5th December, all went well. I had a seroma drained on the 15th December and again on the 21st. Had my planning CT scan on the 22nd, and radiotherapy was planned to start on 18th January. On Thursday 28th the consultant rang to say they weren't happy with the scan as there was too much fluid under my arm, and a rescan is booked for the 11th. Saw the seroma nurse today and have booked an appointment to have it drained again just before the scan. Has anyone else had this happen? And will it mean the radiotherapy will be delayed? I was hoping to get back to work sooner rather than later! Love and hugs Helen xxx",

      "Content": "I was diagnosed at the end of July with grade3 HER2 positive breast cancer tumour of 55mm. I was accepted on to the ROSCO trial and have 4 cycles of TC chemo, had my lumpectomy and lymph node clearance on 5 December. My appointment for the results was for next Friday 22 December, however, the hospital rang yesterday asking to bring the appointment forward to today! I'm now worried they didn't get clear margins and want me back in surgery next week.  I feel I have been very lucky so far, in that chemo was, for me, relatively easy with few side effects apart from hair loss and fatigue. I regularly visit this forum and have seen how awful chemo can be. I am now worried that my 'safety' bubble has burst. The surgeon did warn me about the possibility of further surgery if he didn't get clear margins. Sorry, I am ranting, falling apart at the very end. Just wondering how many have been in similar situation?",

They bought the appointment forward because the results came back earlier than expected. I had a large seroma in my armpit which was drained, feel much more comfortable now. Just continue with my exercises and awaiting radiotherapy now. BIG HUGS to everyone xxx",

      "Content": "Hi ScaredGirl I too have IDC, HER2 positive Grade 3 breast cancer in my left breast, I had a marker inserted during the biopsy, where they also found it had spread to a lymph node. I did have a bone scan and a CAT scan of my chest though, as well as the heart scan and a liver function test. This may have been due to my age and weight, as I am quite large and 54 (next week, lol) I was asked to take part in the ROSCO trial, which will hopefully limit my cycles of Chemo to just 4. All my results came back fine, no spread anywhere other than the lymph node! I had my second Chemo yesterday, it is a really long and very boring day. So far my side effects have been quite mild, especially after reading some of the effects some poor souls have had! I feel very lucky! I know this doesn't really answer your questions, but trust the doctors, they have been doing this for a long time! I'm sure someone will have some answers for you. Stay positive, I know it isn't always easy, but it does help. Love and hugs Helen xxx",
