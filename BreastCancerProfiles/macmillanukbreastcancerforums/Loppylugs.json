      "Content": "Hi I don't know if this is helpful but.... men generally have infintesimally small breasts (except there's a man that lives near me.... oh sorry, I digress) but they DO get breast cancer as well. It may be rare but it happens so in my humble opinion, size is not the issue... 'change' is. Karen",

      "Content": "Hi Catlover (me too) My lump was diagnosed just about a month ago. It is 6cm huge and there are a couple of infected lymph nodes too but I'm not especially gloomy about it, not after getting over the initial shock, which is where you are right now I suspect. The knee jerk reaction is 'get it out NOW' but even this is not stricly necessary - bad things don't happen overnight. Taking a deep breath and getting everything into perspective, I found useful. Overnight I went from being a senior manager in the NHS to being a patient of the NHS!! But, if ever I had doubts about healthcare, specialists, consultants, decision making etc etc then they've gone. I now know what a million people must already know - in most cases, for most people, this organisation is just purely brilliant. Personally I have found the clinic staff and specialists to be caring, attentive and thorough - I trust their experience implicitly. I am not even thinking in any way than as a patient - my previous work experience is now irrelevant. I hope that you will feel this sense of being cared for shortly and realise that, with luck, your cancer is treatable and you will come through OK as many of us here will do. This site is brilliant - have a good moan, cheer someone else up or just read some stuff. This is peer support at it's very best. So... see you around :-) Best wishes Karen",
