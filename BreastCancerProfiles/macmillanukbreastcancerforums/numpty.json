When my daughter had breast cancer 2008, she was the only woman in a work force of men,her boss was so good gave her all the time off she needed,unfortunatly my daughter died in 2009 age 36,her boss and all the men there were so so upset by it all. I do hope youe boss changes her attitude towards you, and i wish you all the best,do not change you operation date you come first.",
