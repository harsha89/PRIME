      "Content": "Hello all...well, I'm very late to your group and it is unfortunate for us to be here, however so grateful we have each other!! I received docetaxel in 2013...my hair grew back nearly the EXACT same way as yours did pcmd!!  I talked to a hair restoration specialist who said I had \"female pattern baldness\"... I have a huge cowlick in my crown that has slowly thinned and now I have a bald spot, which seems to be getting bigger. :( Initially, I had cortisone shots from my dermatologist, however that didn't help.  I had thick hair, now my follicles hurt...my hair pattern has grown in such a weird pattern.  I don't like to complain a lot as some women do not even get their hair back, but I am getting to the point of how much more can I take...the loss of a breast due to an infection, etc..... Thank you all for letting me go on, huge hugs to all of you!!!",
