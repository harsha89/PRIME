    "Content": "hi dee i got flu about 4 weeks after surgery and two months after chemo , i went to my gp as my symptoms seemed to be worse than an average cold . i was perscribed a weeks antibiotics not because it helps cold symptoms but to prevent the cold gong to my chest and developing an infection. after chemo and after surgery our white cells can still be low so it might be worth going to your gp if the cold gets worse. since i got the all clear from the hospital a few weeks ago i've had no contact with them but my gp was able to listen to my chest and check my lungs and give me reassurance. i hope this helps and you start to feel better soon",
