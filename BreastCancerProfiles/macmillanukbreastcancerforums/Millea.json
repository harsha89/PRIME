    "Content": "Hello everyone - I am new here and this is my first post. I was diagnosed with Invasive ductal breast cancer grade 2 ten days ago. I have so far had an appt at Royal Free Breast clinic and met the consultant and my assigned nurse and had a bone scan (which came back clear). This week I am attending an appt at Oncology Dept @ RF, having a CT scan and then meeting the Consutant at the Breast Clinic again on Wednesday to review CT scan results and discuss treatment going forward. There are two things I would initially appreciate any info on from any of you who may know: Firstly, it's been suggested to me by three separate parties that UCLH Breast Clinic would be a better place to receive treatment and they have suggested that I request a referral to UCLH, and secondly, the proposed treatment is that I receive Chemo therapy (5 or 6 sessions) prior to having a mastectomy - has anyone else done this and is this now usual protocol? I was surprised as my sister (who had breast cancer 22 years ago) was operated on first and then received Chmo and radiotherapy. I appreciate that that was a while ago and protocol has no doubt be changed since then. Any thoughts though? Any info on the above would be really appreciated. As you know at this early stage and with such a recent diagnosis I am feeling numbed and shocked with a million questions and fears buzzing in my head. I have not yet told my daughters - I have triplets aged 19 and am a single mum. One of my daughters is autistic and I am particularly worried about how she would take this info as she worries and frets about even small things. I am inclined to not tell her but with chemo looming this doesn't seem like an option.Â  Thanks.",
