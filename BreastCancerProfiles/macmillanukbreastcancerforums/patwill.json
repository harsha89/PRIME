Now what do you think she said ? she asked me what I thought they were and what did I think she should do, well errrr Im not the doctor you are, I can't remember going to med school, any way she is asking Oncologist to take a look next week when I go to see her, hopefully it is nothing but better to be sure.

Had to tell Dad a little white lie as to why I will not be going to see him tomorrow ( I go every morning as we just lost my Mum) and haven't told my children yet as I don't want to worry them, so this is hard trying to put a brave face on to everyone and acting as though everything is normal. Ive not been too bad up to now but today I am shaking and tearful and wondering if this is my last normal day as I know it.

Don't fret about feeling tired and weepy, we have all been there , cry when you want and sleep when you want, you will soon be feeling much better. I still am shattered and could fall asleep standing up at times so I just get on sofa for a hour and have a nap, still weepy at times just let your mind and body heal at its own pace.
