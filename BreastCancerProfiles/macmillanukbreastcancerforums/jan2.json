      "Content": "i had the same problem when i changed area GP and was told there was a chance i couldnt register because i didnt have a passport (it was out of date from last year and i wasnt going anywhere due to chemo etc) or a driving licence - i dont drive! I had to supply utility bills, all sorts and all i had to prove picture wise it was me was my pass for work and on that i didnt look like me because i had real hair then. After a lot of hoo-har they accepted me then i problems getting my arimidex!!! I got it but what a fight and stressful situation to be in when you are going through this. Grrrrrrrrrr...............",

      "Content": "yes i agree with Carol above, put some ice lollies in the freezer and use the plastic cutlery etc, this is the pits i had this for 6 months so know how rubbish you feel. I know you have to keep ytour nutrition up but i craved all kinds of rubbish i had never had before, pork pies, i ate by the dozen, the thought of them makes me feel sick now. Does anyone else agree that whilst you are on chemo its like being pregnant, you get really odd cravings for all kinds of stuff you would never ever eat during normal times. Good healing evryone xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",

I had bone scan - i started off on arimidex but it bought me out in a dreadful rash from the 4th month so aromasin is miles better now its in the system - the only problems with it is remembering to take it every day! keep on with it the flushes will gradually go, i started off with dreadful flushes but they are hardly noticeable now.

The flushes will die down in time, mine are not as bad as they were 9 months ago, stick with it and things will get better, xx",

      "Content": "to be honest i feel very stressed after reading it. Having breast cancer myself i am distressed that you claim conventional medicine only works on 4% of people who have it. I have had chemo and surgery and about to take 15 sessions of radio therapy but at least there is a chance i may still be alive next christmas. I doubt i would be if i went off to take some herbal cure that has no medical evidence that it works. I am sorry andi dont mean to be rude but i do not like your site at all. Its exactly sites and postings like this that make me never to want to return to cancer backup site again for fear of it being just too upsetting. Thahk you for ruining my evening.",
