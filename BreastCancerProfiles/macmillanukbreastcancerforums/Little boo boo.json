      "Content": "Hi kaz18 lt is a really hard time for you. l know exactly how you feel. l too was diagnosed with Er+  lobular breast cancer in my right breast also at age 48. That was in March 2017. l won't kid you it was the hardest thing l have ever been through and it took away nearly a year of my life. l had a mastectomy with implant reconstruction and I've just had a nipple reconstruction. l also had a full node clearance and 6 EC chemo. It turned out l have 5 areas of globular cancer However l am through the other side. Stronger and happier. You appreciate the small things more.  So you will get through this... surround yourself with family and good friends . Let them help you emotionally and with practical stuff  l lost my hair during chemo and now l have a short pixie cut, but do you know what it's thicker in texture and l like it better",

I didn't actually ask for the immediate reconstruction on the good breast,  when I saw surgeon pre op he asked me what size I would like the implant ( I didn't expect to get a choice!  - I asked for a D cup --- was a droopy F cup) I said oh my I will look a right lopsided mess and straight away he said no we will do the other side at the same time. At the moment they are swollen but I'm pleased with the size and shape. And best of all when I take my bra off they stay in the same place lol",

I was told to do that and that each drain had to get under 50ml before it could come out. I understand that if you have a haematoma the area will be painful, red, swollen and hot. I can understand why you will worry, see the doc or the breast care nurse as soon as you can and they will either put your mind at rest or sort you out. I felt better today after my surgeon redid my dressings and reassured me all was well. I have had a reduction and uplift on the good side too. Tightness is normal, stinging is normal. I know all this as I am a surgery veteran  I have numerous issues and have had numerous big operations. Plenty of rest and look forward to fun things you can do when you are better k x",

Five years ago I also had a small lump (turned out to be benign , but I also had shooting pains with this), hence why I had my new shooting pains checked out. Nothing showed up on a mammogram but a dodgy area was located with an ultrasound and a biopsy taken, this turned out to be cancerous. MRI located one more area of cancer. One mastectomy later and my right breast was found to contain 5 areas of lobular cancer. I didn't have any other symptoms apart from the shooting pains, no nipple or skin problems and no lump. Having said that most breast pain turns out to be nothing to worry about! I grateful for those shooting pains though... cos at least I found it. It may be worth having an MRI if you haven't already had one.  Wishing you well and hoping that you turn out with no reason for worry K x",
