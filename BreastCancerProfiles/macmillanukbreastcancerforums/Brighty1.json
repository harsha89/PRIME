      "Content": "Hi I have just not long been diagnosed with ILC in my right breast a b5b biopsy just over three weeks ago two days after my Mums funeral had to move house due to not being able to pay the bills and have also been off work with Large Vessel GCA which is affecting my lower aorta and two femoral arteries for a year also lost my eyesight back in feb 2018 but luckily managed to save it with high dose steriods.Have had a terrible time with all this since last Feb. Now I have to face breast cancer too. I am a 55yr old single Mum with a teenage daughter who is testing aswell.I  have had three sets  of biopsies ultra sounds and a MRI. Just waiting to see my Surgeon on 1st March now who I met three weeks ago and has been on holiday since. They are still not sure about left breast it's  b3 biopsy  but have had further biopsies today.They said I will have surgery but it's been a scary wait whilst the Surgeon has been on holiday and they are waiting to get all the results of all the tests back. Not sure what I face next but exhausted and frightened just need a bit of support to get me through this and really overwhelmed right now.",
