      "Content": "Hi all. I apologise if I have come to the wrong area of the site. I haven\u2019t been diagnosed with breast cancer but have found a lump which I recently had an ultrasound on. I\u2019m looking for advice on whether ultrasounds are a reliable diagnosis tool (without sounding like a hypochondriac). I\u2019ll start from the beginning. I\u2019m 29, I\u2019ve been having pains in my left breast for over 6 months now. Then around 6 weeks ago I had this awful dream I was diagnosed with incurable breast cancer after finding a lump. Anyway when I woke up, I felt my breast where the lump was in my dream and lo and behold there was a lump there!  I was referred to the breast clinic but feel they didn\u2019t take my fears seriously. They did an ultrasound and the radiologist said \u201c100% not breast cancer just a cyst or fibdoadeoma\u201d, they didn\u2019t do a biopsy. Can he really be 100% sure just from an ultrasound? Since then I have spoken to a girl at work who had breast cancer three years ago. She said that her ultrasound showed a benign lump and was told it wasn\u2019t cancer, but after a biopsy she was diagnosed with BC. This has started up my panic again. The pain is there 24 hours a day, it\u2019s all through my left breast (especially round the nipple) and sometimes down my arm. The lump is slightly mobile but feels as though it is fixed to something behind it. What I want to know is if anyone has had similar experiences in ultrasound diagnosis? Have you been told that it\u2019s nothing to worry about but then from your own persistence later found out the dreaded news? Any help or even reassurance  will be much appreciated.  Apologies I don\u2019t have a cancer diagnosis but just really hoping anyone can help.  Thank you",

      "Content": "Hi Gail, thanks so much for your quick response. I think what\u2019s worse is feeling like it\u2019s all in my head and I have no one to speak to. My partner and family all think I\u2019m stupid for going on about it despite getting the \u2018all clear\u2019 - possibly why I turned to this forum. There is this nagging feeling and I just can\u2019t get that dream out of my head.  Thank you for being so kind and replying x",

      "Content": "Hi all, thank you so much for your informative comments. Carolyn, the story of your premonition is very strange, much like my dream. I feel so strongly that it is my body\u2019s way of trying to tell me there is something wrong!  Funnily enough my doctor rang me this morning to say some blood tests I had at the start of the week had come back abnormal, he said there were raised proteins in the blood which indicated an inflammatory response. I mentioned again, the pain I am having in my left breast and my concerns over the lump. He asked me to go in this afternoon!  He said he doesn\u2019t think the lump is anything to worry about but he has referred me back to the breast clinic to have it removed. He feels that my mind would be put to rest by removal to which I whole heartedly agreed! (I have a history of anxiety) I was looking at going private, but with the referral today and the guarantee to be seen within two weeks I think I will stick to the NHS for now. He also gave me some anti-inflammatories to help with the pain. I have felt generally \u2018off\u2019 for a year now. Constant infections and fatigue despite cutting back my hours at work and going part time. I know it\u2019s not \u2018looking good\u2019 and there is definitely something going on but I\u2019m still trying to think positive. He did say everything else in the blood test was fine (white blood cell count etc) which should put my mind at ease?? Thank you again for your responses, I will let you know how everything goes and if it turns out to be bad news I know the place to turn to! Thank you Jen xx",
