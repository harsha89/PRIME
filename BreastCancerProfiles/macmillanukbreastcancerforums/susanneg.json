      "Content": "Hi ronstar, sorry to hear about your ongoing issues with pain and mobility. I have a constant ache in my right shoulder (the non-cancer one) but suspect it might partly be because I'm favouring it because of the lymphedema in the left one. I'm a bit worried about how both will stand up to RT but will just have to grit my teeth. I was sorry too to hear about your employment fears. I gather you are self-employed at present. Do you work for several different employers? If you belong to a union it might be worth seeking advice as in some circumstances a succession of fixed term contracts with one employer in HE can give you more rights. But perhaps your employers are trying to get round this through the type of contract they are using. I'm guessing that you need to do a lot of technical demonstrating in your teaching but I'm wondering if you can use some of the time off work to think about how much you could get across to your students through other means, such as audio-visual etc? Wishing you lots of renewed energy and spirits very soon, susanneg",

At the very least he should have introduced himself after the campaign by the doctor who was a cancer patient to not be treated by nameless individuals as on a conveyer belt. If you have supposedly been discharged you should have been given a written plan recording your treatment and any follow up appointments and the details of who to contact if anything arises before your next mammogram. Ensuring that any post- surgery tidy up is included on this would be a possible route forward. Definitely ask for another appointment with your consultant and just possibly think about discussing counselling too - you have had such a roller coaster of experiences and with your return to work still problematic talking to the right person might be helpful.

For my first full body one my son stayed with me to hold my hand, and for the breast one a nurse did the same. I also wore an eyeshade so never saw how close the tube felt. The operator should also count you through the different cycles over the intercom so you have a sense of how long each burst will last. For the most recent one I took a diazepam which definitely did make it easier.  Waiting for the results is hard too so try to find nice things to do to take your mind off it.

They will be in a better position to evaluate how you are responding to surgery, whether there's an infection, and what you might need, even if you then need to get a prescription from your GP. For what it's worth I had some redness when I saw mine at two weeks but they didn't view it as a cause for concern. Hope you get it sorted and feel better soon! susanneg",

Obviously I don\u2019t know what your oncologist was trying to say but it\u2019s possible he was referring to how long you should take Letrozole. It has been 5 years but new research shows benefit in taking it for 10 years. Also 5 Years is the way they standardise their statistics - it certainly doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ve only 5 years to live! In fact it sounds as though your cancer was caught early and fully treated which is great news. But obviously the problem for you now is the effects of your hormonal treatment. I\u2019m HER2+ so I have no experience of this but I know there\u2019s a lot of discussion in the group about getting the right type and brand for each individual which can be a bit trial and error. Hopefully some others will be along soon to talk to you about this.  Could you talk to your GP about your current state of mind? And request an appointment with your breast nurse or oncologist to discuss the pros and cons of ending the hormonal treatment so you can make a fully informed decision?And discuss your options for getting help with your emotional state as well as the physical symptoms? I have just started therapy and medication for depression following the end of my treatment for inflammatory breast cancer. I resisted the idea I was depressed during treatment but now feel I need to do something to help me move forward. I also did a Breast Cancer Care Moving Forward course at my hospital. They do them around the country and they were a useful source of information and good to talk and share experience with other women. It was held at our Maggie\u2019s centre, which can also provide support if there\u2019s one near you. You sound a strong and creative person who is understandably very exhausted and laid low emotionally by what you have gone through but there are ways to get help, and I do hope you will find the right way for you.

      "Content": "Hi FlopsyUK, I'm sorry to hear what a bad time you've been having. I haven't really been in anything like your situation but I did keep an eye on whether the GP letters matched my experience of the consultant appointment. I have occasionally observed my onc  beginning to draft these via dictaphone during the consult and occasionally errors ( eg drug names) did creep in when transcribed by the secretary ( or, as I've heard rumoured, personnel in India!). They do sign them off as having been electronically checked though.  It sounds as though your onc might have been a bit on auto- pilot ( which is not to excuse them).  When I did need to have a second meeting with my surgeon after an unsatisfactory discussion I took a friend along and it turned out there was a student present + the BCN turned up. But it worked out well as I got the decision I wanted and the surgeon apologised for the earlier break down in communication: 'Always listen to the patient' he told the student! So I suppose what I'm thinking is that if you can take someone along and prepare the points you want to make in advance, meeting with the consultant might resolve this now and also make him/her aware of your continuing problems. After another appointment with you s/he would have to write it up again for the GP and that would be an opportunity to set the record straight. It might also be worth seeing your GP about managing your current symptoms better and that would be a chance to discuss how the consultation actually went and your concerns. You do seem in low health and spirits and this needs to noted and dealt with. Good luck with everything. Susanne xx",

I am an academic involved in research and writing, with a number of projects on the go. I find it hard to envisage being cut off from the research environment and facilities provided by my job, and in the past I have greatly enjoyed my teaching, exhausting though it often is. The admin is another story entirely! I have been signed off on full pay for three months and currently plan to take the full six months that I am entitled to, and go back on a phased return before Easter. I have a long commute, but with no teaching the late spring/early summer period is usually not too demanding as that is when we are expected to do most of our research and writing, often working at home. However I don't know yet how I will be feeling physically and psychologically by then.  I don't currently have a partner and my son is grown up. I could retire and take some or all of my pension now, have no mortgage or debts, and have also deferred my state pension for several years. (At some point I will need to decide whether to take it as extra pension, which was previously my plan, as I come from a long-lived family, or as a taxable lump sum). So luckily financial issues aren't the main problem for me. However  my diagnosis of inflammatory breast cancer, with its high risk of recurrence, has put my previous plans in doubt, and I'm now really torn between wanting to continue my career for a little longer or de-stressing my life by retiring or going part-time next year. I think I probably need to have some counselling to arrive at the right decision, and I'm certainly not going to rush making up my mind. The only advice I have for any of you deciding to retire now is to get a forecast of your state pension and the number of years you have towards this and as others have said to seek advice from the Macmillan financial team about benefits and tax etc. I've also found the online Moneysavingexpert forums a good source of information. Good luck to everyone in making the right choice for you. susanneg",

They can\u2019t start full massage until your treatment is done but should be able to prescribe sleeves and if you need them, gloves. I went for black as the flesh coloured ones can get very grubby but my nurses are extending the colour range in the new year. You should moisterise the affected areas daily at night. If you are working you should look into what reasonable adjustments can be made as this will be a permanent condition ( though hopefully it will improve a little in time and at least not get worse with the right treatment) preferably via a report from an occupational health consultant. To give you an example, I\u2019m a university lecturer and the OH consultant recommended I be able to work at home when doing purely admin tasks. My institution then had an assessment done of my \u2018work station\u2019 at home ( aka my dining room!) and provided  me with a proper desk chair and a support and mouse so my laptop was at the right height. I am also getting a lighter laptop ( as I have a long commute) and voice recognition software to cut down the time I have to use the keyboard. Having had cancer counts as a life time disability under the Equality act and employers are required to at least look into what can be done to make it possible to continue working in your current role. Hope this helps, Susanne xx",

My cancer was on the left so I had to do breath hold. If you have mammary node involvement it might be worth discussing radiotherapy to this area as I was told that any local recurrence there would be hard to treat via surgery.   Decision making is hard. In my case I just tried to inform myself as much as possible once I knew what was being proposed. Good luck to both of you with it all. Susanne xx",

Research shows this is the case for the majority of women who go down this route, especially the ones who don't have reconstruction and avoid some of the potential issues there. I had a long telephone talk with one of the Macmillan nurses yesterday, who was really supportive and helpful in validating my feelings and need to have a proper decision-making meeting with my surgeon, as well as what I want to get over to him. I'm really clear now what my goals are and why a bilateral mastectomy is the solution that in ronstar's words I will \"hate least\". I just wish it wasn't necessary to \"fight\" about this at a time when one is already pretty exhausted from chemo and looking forward to surgery with some anxiety. I've written notes and pros and cons for both the bilateral mastectomy and reduction, and a friend is coming with me to be a second set of ears, when I see the surgeon this afternoon.

      "Content": "Hello, everyone. I was diagnosed with IBC in June and am coming up to my last treatment at the beginning of October with surgery in November. I was staged 3c because of lymph node involvement and am HER2+++. Treatment has been FEC-T and Docetaxel, Perjeta and Herceptin. Now I am coming up to surgery in November I am finding the decision process difficult and emotionally disturbing. I will have a mastectomy and axillary node clearance of course, but have been offered a breast reduction which could be done at the same time, but requires various choices. For personal preference I would opt for a double mastectomy to overcome the 'symmetry' issue but I understand why there is reluctance to take off what is probably a healthy breast ( a symptom has developed there of nipple discharge but surgeon and oncologist don't seem worried about it so far ). My oncologist advises keeping it simple, just have the mastectomy and make decisions about anything else later, but I want to avoid any further operations as far as I can and at this stage don't think I will go for any reconstruction later. So I do need to make up my mind about having the reduction now, and what form it should take, as well as the implications eg if problems arose that delayed the start of radiography, given the need for continuity and speed in treating IBC.  Sorry about the long post but I would really appreciate hearing the experiences of anyone further down the line, especially about living with one breast, which I find a more difficult concept than having both removed.",

      "Content": "Dear ronstar, many thanks for taking the time to make this very helpful response. I haven't really had the 'double mastectomy' argument with my surgeon. I had sent a message prior to the meeting  that I wanted to discuss the pros and cons but once there he almost immediately started talking about a reduction and the details/choices involved (with little sketches!). I wasn't prepared for this and the only thing I was clear on (since like you I have huge anxieties about the operation) was that I wanted any procedures over and done with in one go. So the day after I heard that the booked date was changed so he could operate with the chief oncoplastic surgeon, to keep time in the theatre down. He is by all accounts a very good surgeon and also very nice and warm - it was he who gave me the original diagnosis - but I am uncertain now whether this is a standard offer to a patient like me or a way of deflecting me from the bilateral issue. There was no discussion of reconstruction, which I understand I probably couldn't have for a year or so. All I know is that, for the very first time since this is all started, back in my car I was in floods of tears, and plunged into a very down mood, with more tears when talking to my breast nurse (she was unfortunately away the week I saw the surgeon so the one sitting in was one I didn't know). But now she's back she's been supportive and concerned about my emotional state. I had a meeting with her to get some sense of the \"enticing\" world of prostheses, and afterwards came with me to my oncologist appointment, when they both gave a lot of time to talking through my state of mind, was I depressed etc and if so what to do about it. But again no real discussion of double mastectomy as a option - I don't even know what the Trust policy is though as it's a Cancer Centre of Excellence I suspect they do do it sometimes. They seemed surprised that the surgeon had offered the reduction now, and we left it that the oncologist and surgeon would talk, and another appointment with the surgeon would be made for me.  Have you read this very recent article outlining a 'consensus' on Contralateral Prophylactic Mastectomy and patient decision-making? http://www.associationofbreastsurgery.org.uk/media/67588/cpm_asbrs_consensus_cpm_shared_decision_making.pdf The assumption made is that most patients want it out of uninformed fear, but like you, I accept the evidence that other breast removal is not (in most cases) a preventative of recurrence and this isn't my motive (or wasn't at all until the nipple bleeding began!) I really like your phrase about the option you hate least - that's exactly how I feel.  And if I have to have a single mastectomy then reduction has to be part of it. I don't have such clear reasons as you for my gut instinct that  I could live better with a bilateral mastectomy and no reconstruction. For me I think it's partly to do with already having an external signifier of this disease in the form of lymphoedema and my work as a lecturer, where I have to be able to stand up and 'perform' in front of all kinds of audiences - not so much the visual aspects, which I know can be managed, but my own sense of self. . It's interesting you are considering a 'wait and see' option after all, but as you say you now have your choice confirmed to fall back on. I too have been wondering if I should take the oncologist's advice and 'keep it simple' and avoid any chance of holdups in my future treatment. But then I doubt if the double mastectomy would ever be an option unless they found another cancer there of course... So I guess I need to try and make my case when I see the surgeon next and see where that gets me. Thanks too for the heads up about the psychological assessment, if I get to that point.  Writing this to you has helped me clarify some things further. All the very best to you for continuing recovery and excellent quality of life! Susanne",

      "Content": "A good result today! We have agreed that I will have a bilateral mastectomy, either in the slot already booked (with two operating), when the operation will be done in one go, or doing the cancerous one first and the other one fairly soon after. The decision which one it will be depends on the results of a test of a blood sample taken from the nipple on the other breast. I think if it turns out to be pre-cancerous or a papilloma then there will just be the one operation, if it's something else that doesn't need immediate attention I will have two separate operations. He is taking it to the multi-disciplinary team meeting but I didn't get a sense that there would be any issues there. And no psychological assessment required!  I was worried at the start. Not only was a student there (I was asked to OK this of course, which I did) but the surgeon started off with ' I thought we had a plan', then talking about the nipple bleeding which he now appeared to be taking seriously.  He started more of his sketches which I think were about how he could incorporate duct removal into the current plan of breast reduction. At that point I managed to steer him onto a discussion of bilateral mastectomy and my reasons for wanting it, though as it turned out I didn't have to go through all the arguments I'd prepared. The key thing was that I conveyed that I'd researched it carefully and  that it wasn't about preventing recurrence,  as I was aware of and accepted the evidence about this, but about my quality of life going forward. I also talked about how upset I'd been after the reduction discussion and how that had shown me it wasn't the right choice for me. I think what convinced him overall was that I was making a rational, informed choice, and that while emotion was  involved it was part of a process which showed me the way to the right  choice for me, rather than being swept up in an emotional state where I might end up regretting my decision.  I 'passed the test' in his words. Though I do think the presence of a symptom in the other breast has also made it easier for the bilateral mastectomy to become an option. Actually he was very apologetic, not only about having upset me, but about  'not getting it right' in terms of having a full discussion last time. So overall my trust in him was restored and I respected him for not being defensive. When I said that at least it was an interesting discussion for his student to have heard he said the lesson was 'Listen to your patient', and I felt he meant it. Such a relief to have things resolved this way, and while I had to be clear and assertive it didn't in the end feel like a fight. Thanks to everyone for sharing your experiences and support! S ",

Depending on your stage (which will depend on size  and grade of tumour and whether any nodes are involved ) you may get pertuzamab along with Herceptin and Docetaxel. Both pertuzumab and Herceptin are biological targeted therapies not chemotherapy. They work together to stop cancer cells replicating and are having very good results as neoadjuvant treatment, with a high percentage of women found to have all the cancer gone after surgery (called a pathological complete response). Continuing with Herceptin for a year continues that process to mop up any hidden stray mini cells that don't show up on scans. You might also have radiotherapy which does this too. As you are ER+ as well you will have the treatments designed for this such as tamoxifen. As ER+ Cells  develop much more slowly than HER2+ ones this oral treatment goes on for longer, possibly nowadays for ten years. The availability of these treatments is why the survival rate for breast cancer is now so high and improving all the time. Good luck with everything - you will be in good hands and it is all doable.

Ronstar and I had a very helpful discussion while I was making up my mind and you can find an account of the result of the discussion with my surgeon in an earlier one of my posts. I had to convince that I wasn't acting out of fear and was aware of the evidence relating to impact on recurrence. I wasn't required to have a psychological report - the surgeon said that our discussion was enough and that my reasons were very clear and fully thought through. I had had a very negative and emotional reaction to the idea of mastectomy and breast reduction to achieve symmetry, and that was an important reason why I ended up with this choice.  In the decision letter the surgeon said that the MDT had decided that my wish was 'not unreasonable' and therefore agreed it. As Ronstar says they want to be sure you are not acting purely from unfounded fear and emotions that will cause you regret after, as well as acting on evidence. However, as I had developed a nipple discharge in the other breast which showed abnormal cells it was decided to do both in the same operation - if clear they would have been done separately. I am a little worried that if I develop any side effects there might be a delay in starting radiotherapy but having fewer operations was one of my goals. As I have Inflammatory Breast  cancer reconstruction isn't on the cards for me immediately, and at present don't plan on it, but might change my mind about that.  I have to admit I'm terrified of the operation but know I have to go through with it and that I'm in good hands. I hope you find your way to the right de idiom for you and that your team is supportive.",

      "Content": "Hi KiwiCardi, I developed lymphoedema in my left arm early on before surgery as a result of the cancer invading my lymphatic system ( I knew nothing about the lymphatics before this). I was measured, including the amount of fluid, and given sleeves and gloves. It has taken quite a while to find the right size and make. I wear these from morning to bedtime. I was given some exercises - mostly deep breathing, using a soft ball in my armpit, and pumping the hand and arm while sitting. I was made to understand that manual drainage couldn't begin until after radiotherapy and active treatment had finished as there is thought to be some risk that any remaining cancer could be moved through the lymphatics. So although I was first referred to the Lymphoedema clinic in July last year I only started having drainage in May. So far I have had two entirely different types of drainage at the clinic, one by an independent practitioner and the other by the nurses. The independent one works on much more of the body and feels more like a regular massage, the nurses focus just on the area concerned e.g. The breast or the arm. The general principal in both is to open up the lymphatic areas away from the affected part and to encourage the lymphatic fluid to find other outlets. It may be that the gentle sweeps with the edge of the hand that my nurses have shown me are what is called brushing but they haven't referred to it as that. I can't say that I've seen much reduction in swelling but regard it as ( hopefully) a way of preventing it getting worse or hardening. The really important thing is to guard against cellulitis by moisturising the arm and guarding against cuts or bites.  I do hope yours can be managed well before it develops any further. I have to say it's been one of the hardest things for me to deal with as it is such a visible reminder of what has happened - one complete strangers are only too ready to ask about. You might want to have an answer ready prepared if you have to wear a sleeve regularly.. Susanne.",

      "Content": "These are the NICE guidelines for follow-up to early/locally advanced breast cancer, taken from the 'Information for Patients' part of their website. If you think that your care does not match what is described in this information, please talk to a member of your healthcare team. After treatment, your healthcare team should discuss with you where you would like to have follow-up care. It may be your GP's surgery, the hospital or a mixture of both. You should be given a written care plan that you have agreed with your healthcare team. A copy should also be sent to your GP. The plan should include the names of the healthcare professionals involved in your care, dates for review of any treatment you are receiving, signs and symptoms to look for and seek advice on, details of mammograms, and who to contact for immediate referral to specialist care or for support services, such as for patients with lymphoedema. Mammograms You should be offered a mammogram every year until you reach the age when you will automatically be included in the NHS Breast Screening Programme or the Breast Test Wales Screening Programme. If you are already in one of these screening programmes when you finish treatment for early or locally advanced breast cancer, you should be offered a mammogram every year for the first 5 years.",

      "Content": "Hi Lin, I did the Moving Forward course at the Churchill in Oxford. It was held at the Maggie\u2019s Centre there and the speakers were a mix of nurses and complementary approaches speakers (eg mindfulness). Obviously the presenters and thus possibly the topics will differ around the country but I imagine the format would be roughly the same. There was quite a lot of time given to the effects of hormonal treatments which is fair enough as this is the type of breast cancer that is most common. As someone with IBC i didn\u2019t feel there was anything really specific to my concerns, especially around fears of recurrence, but that was what I expected. I was still having Herceptin and Pertuzumab when I did it but most of the other ladies had been discharged. There were about 14 of us and the best part really was talking to some of them and sharing experiences in a pleasant environment.We were a very diverse group and one lady had come from Bath as there wasn\u2019t one coming up there. We also got a bag of coconut oil goodies at the end. Some of the information or suggestions are bound to be helpful and doing it does help give a sense that one is taking control and moving on, so it achieves its main purpose.  I was diagnosed with depression after I finished all treatment and have been fortunate in that Macmillan are funding the implementation of a project at my hospital to identify and provide treatment during and after treatment, through a mix of medication and CBT. It was originally trialed at Edinburgh and Oxford and reported in The Lancet several years ago. As many here have reported the emotional effects of having had cancer often crash in on us when everything stops, and I think it\u2019s very positive that these kinds of initiatives are being introduced.  All the best, Susanne",

      "Content": "A really useful discussion as I've just started RT using R1 and R2. What makes the timings tricky for me is having to put my lymphoedema sleeve on first thing, which means I can't shower again later before going to the appointment in the afternoon. The company's guidance basically says don't apply R2 less than 4 hours before RT treatment. All my appointments are after 3.00. and look as though they will often run late, so I don't think I need to wash  off lotion applied before 9.00. before leaving for the hospital? What do others think? I think also I will have to make do with 3 a day, except at weekends. I'm only 15 minutes from the hospital traffic permitting so will plan on using R1 as soon as I get home and R2 a bit later and before going to bed. I'll also double check the area to be covered today - thanks for the tip, ronstar. Susanne",
