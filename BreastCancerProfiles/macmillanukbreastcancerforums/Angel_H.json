      "Content": "Hi DebBee25,  I'm sorry to hear you have to go through this operation.  I know how you feel as I am just recovering from my second operation (mastectomy then auxillary node removal on my left side).  My emotions have varied from thinking I can handle this, no problem to sheer fear and emotional breakdowns; I am sure this is normal for everyone going through this.   People very often don't know what to say and I can assure you that I had the same said to me over and over again, but we know that it's our own journey and it's going to be very hard.  I am trying to take one step at a time and just focus on the one thing that's coming up next.  I hope that you have a good support network as I have found my friends and family are wanting to help any way they can.  I have 3 children - twins of 8 and a 7 year old - and we have taken the help that our friends have offered us.   Good luck with your operation and keep me posted. A xx",
