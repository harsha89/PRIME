      "Content": "I finish treatment at Christmas and was given the all clear. I am still on tamoxifen and have now have had a pain in one of my ribs on my back. I went to the local gp - thought it was a regular problem, but have now been referred to back to the marsden, surely this is too soon, I only finished chemo in November. I had blood tests and suddenly panicked - I can't go through that all again, just not strong enough yet. Just needed to write the fear down, so I don't have to worry the family.",

      "Content": "It is rough, there is no words to describe it. If people haven't been through it themselves they have no idea what its like. I finished chemo six weeks ago, and my husband can't understand why I'm still tired, due to start Radiotherapy on Monday, then I will be tired, the journey is 2hrs there and 2hrs back, attempting to do it in school time so I can collect my 8yrs old, little stressed. Do have a scream or cry why no one is around, that way you don't need to feel you need to explain anything to anyone. Things which normally wouldn't bother you do, I had a break down about the new curtains, they were the wrong length - and I was the one that measured them, don't do anything when full of chemo drugs, they kill the brain cells. Hope you're feeling better after letting off some steam, thats what this website is for. Try and have a nice weekend, don't push yourself too much. xx",
