      "Content": "Hi Kay.  I will relay this all to my Mom when she is ready, and I'm sure it will be great help.   Did you have any side affects from the injections or tablets? How was the recovery after the lumpectomy? How long did you have to wait for the results for the sentinel biopsy? Or did they remove the nodes at the time of survey?  Thanks again x",

      "Content": "Thank you so for everyone's replies with your journeys and battles. I'm completely overwhelmed with how much support you ladies offer. It's reassuring to know that other ladies and families have been through this and got through the other side. I'm definitely more confident to give advice to my Mom without it being false hope, that there are women out there that have beaten this and came out fighting.  I'm going to support my Mom and Dad as much as I can and make sure we get through this and come out stronger. I do feel like the one who is keeping us together but I'm ok with that role and will have my moments at home but I have my partner to keep me together and you ladies x Is there any companies I should be looking to contact for Travel insurance? Or is there a different thread on here I can check out? Thank you to all you kind ladies for sharing your experiences with me x",

She's having another scan and some more bloods to see if her white blood count has gone up and if her heamotoma has gone down.  Hopefully she is better today and we can get her home.  Thanks again xx",

She is worried that because they haven't tested her any secondary cancer, that it may have spread to other areas.  I will keep you all updated on her progress and I'm sure I will have a 101 questions after the MRI results.  We all can't wait to get on our hols and enjoy our time before a bumpy roads awaits us! Just need to sort travel insurance!!!  Thanks again xx",

      "Content": "Hi Ladies, My Mom had her MX and reconstruction on Wednesday, and had the SNB.  She is still in hospital at the moment, she has a low white blood count, high temp (38) and having a scan as they think she has a Haematoma, really dizzy and passing out. Has anybody else had anything similar and is it anything to worry about?   The Dr's and nurses are not really giving my mom or us much info, and she has been messed about a lot, telling her a lot of miss leading things from day 1.  I know she has had a massive op and its going to be a long journey but I'm worrying like mad.  She is really not herself, she has only got out of bed to have a wee on the commode, shes pretty much bed bound.  She has 2 drains, the one from the breast ins't draining much, but the one from her back (from the reconstruction, used some of her back muscle) is really filling up quite quick.   The worse thing about it all is its like my mom has give up, she just doesn't care and says she just can't be bothered. Any words of advice would be great. Thanks x",

      "Content": "Hi Ladies! Sadly my Mom (aged 56) was diagnosed with Stage 1 Invasive Lobular BC following results of a biopsy on Tues (14/03/2017) I would like to hear other ladies stories as I'm scared stiff to ask google, would rather speak to ladies going through the same and have a few answers for my Mom when she asks. She is awaiting an MRI scan to see if the cancer has spread (i assume this is the norm). Few questions on this...Is this to check if the cancer has spread to other parts of the breast, nodes and body? When the results come back from the MRI can her stage change, as its Stage 1 at the mo? I didn't think they could stage or grade the tumour until they know the exact size and scale of the cancer or if its in the lymph nodes? Also they are awaiting more results to see if its hormone driven. She was also told she would need a Sentinal biopsy.  And briefly discussed removal and reconstruction surgery but didn't mention a Mastectomy. Until she gets the results of the MRI we are still a bit in the dark.  We have booked (last year) a once in a life time holiday to America for 3 weeks and under no circumstances does my Mom want to cancel.  We go 12/04/2017 and return 01/05/2017.  The hospital are hoping to do the MRI and get all the results back before we go so we can have some sort of care plan.  I'm really worried about my Mom wanting to delay any surgery until she returns from our holiday. How quick do they normally do surgery to remove the cancer after the MRI? How quick do they normally do the Sentinal node biopsy? Is my Mom risking it by waiting until May before any surgery and the Sentinal Biopsy?  The Drs have said that if it is hormonal driven that there is a tablet she can take to keep it at bay. Sorry for all the questions but as soon as my Mom heard the word cancer when the Nurse told her, she sort of lost her mind and zoned out and so did my Dad and I didn't want to quiz them too much as its still very fresh for us all and I still haven't got my head around it. Thank you Ladies x",

      "Content": "Hi Ladies, Quick update on my Mom, but not too much to report. Have found some great sites for Holiday Ins, thank you for your help on that. March 23rd the hospital called to say she was ER+ and started on Anastrozole (Arimidex) straight away. She went for her MRI Tuesday 28th March.  The Dr did say they would try and get the results back with a care plan before we go on holiday 13th April.  So my mom rang the DR today and only managed to speak to the secretary and the only info she had was that there has been a discussion of her results but still needs to go to the MDT and they can only see an appointment booked for my Mom May 2nd, we get back off Holiday on the 30th April (not sure what this appointment is for). The DR is in tomorrow so she will call back then. Can anyone help me with their experience and what came next after the MRI? How long for the results, Did you have to go into hospital and discuss the results or was you booked straight into surgery.   My mom just wants to know what is going to be happening and what is planned for when we return so she can enjoy her holiday without worrying too much.  But doesn't want to be too pushy to demand an appointment before we go away to discuss the results if this isn't the normal process, if that makes sense, Hope everyone is well and thank you Laura x",

It can now put my mind at rest and we can enjoy our holiday without worrying, that is if it is ER+ and she can have the tablets while we are away. She has been through the menopause so maybe a different tablet will be prescribed.  I wish you all the best with your recovery and thank you again for your reply  Laura x",

She is booked in May 2nd to discuss surgery options etc. She has been told if they do a lumpectomy they will have to take a marginal area but because my Mom (and myself) don't have the biggest of boobies lol she may have to have a mastectomy but all this will be discussed. She is booked in May 10th for surgery.  Thank you all for your replies and support.  Laura x",
