    "Content": "Hi My mum is having taxol for chemotherapy and has been warned to expect a metal taste in her mouth at some point. Does everyone on chemo get this? Is there anything you can take to prevent this? What can you do to lessen it if you do get it? Are you still able to taste food if you do get it? Sending love to everyone on this journey. xx",
