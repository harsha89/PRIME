      "Content": "Hi everyone. I'm waiting for results of a biopsy. I have an appointment booked for this Thursday. Because this appointment was booked prior to me needing the biopsy (long drawn out story - you can find it in the under 50's group), I would have probably got the results Mon/Tues this week. My question really, is if it was bad news, would they have called me in earlier than Thursday, or are they inclined to just leave it as it is .. ? I have a suspicious mass sort of behind my right nipple. Can't decide if I love or hate Google, you can imagine what I've been finding out there.",
