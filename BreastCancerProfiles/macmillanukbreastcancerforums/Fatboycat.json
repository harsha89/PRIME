    "Content": "Well after surgery to remove lump (BC grade 3) , chemo, more surgery and rads i really thought that i could start to move forward with my life. Yes i have that nasty little tamoxifen tablet for the ten years but hey i can cope. Friday i had a scan just to benchmark my uterus because of family history and starting tamoxifen, and wam here we go again. Biopsy done and told to expect surgery. I feel so sad and angry, this year was meant to be time to forget about hospital appointments and to celebrate living. Why is life so unfair?Â ",
