      "Content": "Hi I'm new to all this - recently had a mastectomy and a few lymph nodes removed which were clear - thank goodness but whilst the consultant is telling me that he has got everything he went in for and that nothing has passed into my lymph nodes and that with hormonal treatment and 6 x sessions of chemo he aims to see me into old age, I am finding it very hard to accept and seem to be in a black hole - is this normal, is there any light at the end of the tunnel - all I can think about is my 7yr old and what the future holds? Any advice?",

      "Content": "Hi Just to say many thanks for your responses - it is such a relief to be able to talk with people who are going through similar treatment and realise that I am being 'normal' if that is the correct phrase for what we are going through. My aim is still to be around to see my little boy reach manhood and it is such a relief to realise that the emotional hiccoughs I am experiencing are usual. Thank you all",
