Having been through it with lymph nodes involved myself, I suggest you start relaxing and enjoy life, keep reminding yourself you are ok, not easy for you,I know and don't compare your self with anybody else, we all go through the same fears, you will be soon through the tunnel and out the other side. Sleep well  tonight xx",

      "Content": "Hi  I was diagnosed with breast cancer 7 years ago, lumpectomy, chemo, radiotherapy, 3 lymph nodes cancerous, was very ill, ended up in bed for 8 months, hospitalised for 5 months, came out in a wheel chair, in 2009. Have worked hard to get well, have been walking about 40mins a day for past 2 years, blessings of having 2 puppies. Re-diagnosed in March this year, lumpectomy, 25/25 lymph nodes cancerous, since then have had CT, Bone, MRI scan. MRI showing blob on liver !!!. Still awaiting results. Cannot have chemo again, as I have a weak heart, oncologist is saying, chemo would only give me 5% higher survival rate in 10 years, he keeps talking about me dying of old age. I am 62. I have been struggling with 2 seromas for the last 8 weeks, my treatment is continually being put off, which is scary I have been very brave and patient, now feeling like I am about to lose the plot, I have searched everywhere to find someone who has survived breast cancer twice with all lymph nodes positive. Everyone at the cancer centre are so sweet and helpful, I don't feel they are telling me the truth, even though I do keep asking questions. About to crash into madness, please help if you can, sorry for being a pain Thank You, God Bless",
