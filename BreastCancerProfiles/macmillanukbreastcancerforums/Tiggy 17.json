      "Content": "Hello Cathy I am on Herceptin and I have been using.  F.A.S.T. (Folic Ameno Scalp Therapy) Shampoo and conditioner and my hair has come back really thick.  You can buy this online but I also noticed it on the shelf in my local Boots store the other day. (Its in a white bottle with purple writing and lid).   I heard of this originally through an article in the Daily Mail and chemotherapy patients were well impressed with it!  It has no parabens which is good too.  I will continue to use  this as although it is about £12.50 for each item, you need only a pea sized amount. I wish you all the best and hope this helps! Best Wishes Tiggy",
