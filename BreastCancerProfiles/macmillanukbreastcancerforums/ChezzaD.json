    "Content": "So I am 50 And went on tamoxifen in November last year ! I felt the same and felt I completely lost myself ! My Gp made the decision to change me to an Astrozone which has been great ! Downside is the oncologist now says it\u2019s not offering me enough protection and I need to go back on the tamoxifen or have an injection alongside my astrozone! The side effects of the injection are the same as tamoxifen ! Feeling really teary! Wondering if it\u2019s worth the risk of taking none of it !!",
