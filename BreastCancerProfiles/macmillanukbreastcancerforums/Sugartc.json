      "Content": "Hi LucyB. Telling your daughter will be hard and emotional. I had to tell my daughters age 11 & 12 a few weeks ago. We felt it was better to be honest but not make false promises. They took it hard and asked if I would die. I told them hopefully when the operation was over and with some treatment that would be the end of it. The BCN advised us its best to be honest. They have had support at school which has been really helpful for them.  I am not a single parent but maybe you could ask a family member or friend to be there with you. I can understand you wanting to keep everything normal. But it isnt normal and it will be hard to hide that from her. We have just kept our lives the same as much as we can. I have tried not to get upset in front of them. Everyone has a different way of dealing with it & hoping you can find what is right for you. Xx",

My hair is naturally curly but not a nice curly. Just a frizzy mess!! Combine that with grey- gorgeous. Ordered some soft cotton beanies to cover it. My oncology nurse did say to cut hair if really long to just above shoulders. If you get any thinning its usually often at the nape so can easily cover it.  X",

I would suggest you give MRI department a quick call & they will let you know.  If they say its fine to go ahead with it in then no worries. If you need to get it out then speak to GP & explain urgency of removal. Sure they will understand. ",

      "Content": "I too had my first daughter at 40 & she is now almost 13. My other daughter is almost 12. I waited until i knew the results of biopsy & the plan before i told them i had breast cancer. It was heartbreaking telling them & they did cry & ask if i would die. I didnt make false promises but did tell them that with surgery & other treatment doctors are hoping it will all be gone. They accepted that.  I told the tutor at school & they have arranged support for them. I gave them a notebook to write worries & thoughts in. They ask random questions from time to time.  Waiting is the hardest thing. Try to keep your thoughts positive but realistic. I know how your mind will be in overdrive wondering about the what ifs.  I  was diagnosed in january and am 4 weekes post mastectomy & Diep and start chemo on friday. This forum is brilliant to ask questions and chat to others.  Good luck with whatever you decide to tell your daughter & when. Let us all know how you get on. Xx",

Recommended M&S. also firm control knickers. Have been told i will also need to wear a corset, which they supply, for 3 months day & night. Just wondering how easy it will be to get support knickers on with a sore chest & belly. Its bad enough now to get them on!  Good luck. X",

Unfortunately i have been battling a chest infection & sinusitis for last few days. Have now got antibiotics so hopefully i will be better for surgery. Life just throws so much at us at once its so hard to remain upbeat. Really trying to keep positive but feeling awful. Never had a chest infection in my life!! Fingers crossed i show dramatic improvement before next week. I will b so dissappointed if i have to delay surgery. ",

I think i was quite diligent in doing the exercises and had quite good movement after 2 months as I remember. You may need physio so ask your consultant about it. I do get aching later in the day. Not painful but just an ache on the side under the armpit.  It is very early days yet. Wishing you a good recovery  tracey",

Had chemo about 11.30 and at 5pm last night started with really bad nausea, headache, tiredness, metal taste in mouth. I was expecting that monday after i finish steroids but not so soon. I took ondansatron as prescribed which was no help. then took the domperidone they gave me for next week but also no effect. Bad headache still despite regular paracetamol. Anyone using anything else for sickness/ nausea? I do not want to start vomiting as only 5 week post Diep. also didnt eat naything from lunch yesterday to this morning when i managed to force in toast so i could take the steroids. My daughter then said i looked like a beetroot-kids are so honest!!",
