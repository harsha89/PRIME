It is so strange though that even when I distract myself and don't feel stressed my body is going mad! I bought some good quality CBD to try and relax,  but that gives me stomach pains too:/ Anyway,  I hope that you have a lovely bank holiday weekend! X",

      "Content": "Sadly no.  The breast is clear with good margins,  but I  have one clear sentinel node and one which looked clear on the scan but has a tumor in it:. I'm absolutely terrified as now have a roughly 1/6 chance of further spread.  To go from hormone therapy to having CT and bone scans in the next couple of weeks and if they are ok the rest of my nodes out followed/preceded by 5 months chemo and hormones has made me feel really ill.  I have mild asthma and mild reflux which I usually don't notice,  but they have both become severe after the news and I ache all over.  I haven't told my daughters yet about the new development as my youngest is taking her actual GCSE's and has some mental health issues and my older one has two really important exams coming up.  I can only think the worst as is being going that way a while now. My sister died three years ago,  my mother two years ago, my youngest developed depression,  horrible sister in law didn't pass on 2 mammogram letters last year from the parental family home she's taken over with her daughter and boyfriend despite my husband owning 1/4 off it and our doctors letters going there for over 20 years until she denied us access 19 months ago when her and dh's mother had a stroke.   She's the reason it's this advanced as I should have had a mammogram last summer....... Work is great - they sent me a huge bouquet of flowers when I told them,  friends great,  my daughters school have her down as having extenuating circumstances and promise to take good care if her through the exams. The deputy head had a mastectomy last October with hormones now so is great too. And I'm entitled to 5 months sick leave on full pay. But all that means nothing if I'm terminal.  ......I find out if it's spread in 11 days.  If it has they leave the nodes,  no chemo, just hormones.  They apparently keep chemo for when things are bad. I don't know if other hospitals do that too? If the scans are ok then I'll have my nodes harvested or chemo first, though if only 1-3 affected (please be the case!!!) Then I can have an oncotype test done on thur cancer and enter a trial if the recurrance rate is low to avoid chemo.  Sorry to ramble on,  and thanks for being here. X",

      "Content": "Hi Claire-H, It sounds like our daughters are about the same age at diagnosis (mine are just turned 16 and 19, with my youngest's birthday  on the day of my mastectomy). I already love this forum for it's support to each other, and it's really interesting to see how treatment varies across the country. I had the first of the two scans yesterday - the bone scan. After the injection (which made me feel suddenly hot!) I sat outside in the hospital gardens in the sunshine with my husband for a little while. He left to collect one of out daughters, and as I was reading there a magpie flew down right in front of me:/  Funny how I keep seeing them at the minute...... Anyway, after greeting it to try and ward off bad luck it's mate called and I then saw them both which was a relief! I don't know if any of you have had a bone scan, but it takes 15 minutes for the whole body one, then 5 minutes for the pelvis and 5 minutes for the chest, followed by about another 5 minutes when they do a low resolution CT scan to allow the different scans to be combined in 3D. It probably took about 50 minutes in total, of which time my arms were above my head for about 25 minutes. I had my mastectomy 19 days before, so could manage it, but was a bit swollen last night and my remaining (hopefully not for long!) nodes feel a bit swollen today. I'm trying not to read too much into that I remember it happened many years ago after a CT scan, and the top of my arm looked a bit different last night too, though slightly better today. At the end the radiographer was cheerful, and happily waved at us, though I know that  it means nothing until the full scan is assessed. I hate this wait though, as the best case scenario is the rest being removed over 4 weeks after the operation, and as I suspect other nodes are affected it could mean the cancer spreading.......oh, well....as everyone says, the wait is the worst!",

You'll probably have some scans (I had a bone scan and a couple of CT scans followed by a liver MRI one) for staging as well which I found scary, but to the breast team is just routine. . About a third of women are node positive so it's not something unusual, just means more (not so great !) treatment.  I had a level 1 and 2 node clearance yesterday so have the dreaded bottle again and a stiff arm, and looking at my letter unexpectedly given TARGIT (which I thought was only for lumpectomies) as well. Hi Pmess, What trial are you taking part in? Is it a new drug or new combination?",

There's a lot of evidence in Europe and the USA to support that, so lucky you:))  I don't know the results from my clearance yet,  but the one which was  positive was too big for that trial or the other opton of radiotherapy alone. I'm still surprised to have been given TARGIT, where a small ball is inserted during surgery (usually into a lumpectomy) to give the radiotherapy as a one-off treatment instead of 20+ daily external ones, and with better results and fewer side effects.   The doctor who invented it works at my hospital, but I wasn't aware of it being used on the nodes before,  so it was a pleasant surprise (in as much as radiotherapy can be!) Good luck with your treatment. Are you going straight to the AI tablets (like Letrozole), or do you need any other treatment first like radiotherapy? X",
