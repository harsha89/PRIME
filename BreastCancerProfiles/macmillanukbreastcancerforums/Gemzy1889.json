      "Content": "Hi, I'm Gemma. Diagnosed early Feb, just had 3rd EC chemo, each time I've had pain but this time is worse it's like a pulling, aching feeling under my arm and in my offending breast but over the other side from the actual lump which is worrying when people say it's just the chemo attacking! Well why is it attacking over there? I haven't had any surgery yet, did anyone else get this pain. I also am getting pain in the lump itself but I kind of get that! ",

      "Content": "Hi Julia, Thank you for your reply, it's come at a very good time, after months of strength and positivity. I totally lost it last night! Completely doubted myself and my future and had the most overwhelming negativity I just couldn't shift! I keep telling myself this time pain is actually good! As that is the chemo kicking the cancer, thanks how you have explained it- no one has put it like that before with the cells and the fact it isn't targeted and that makes complete sense. I have my halfway MRI next week and meeting with surgeon that is really playing on my mind, I darent let myself believe it could be positive news as all it's been lately is bad!  Hope your well Julia  Many Thanks Gemma.",
