    "Content": "Belated birthday wishes, Ella. I'm not on Facebook.  I found my breast lump in August last year. When it was clear that it was cancer I told my friends, those that I have real contact with, and some that live far away. I told my family a bit later, had to find the right moment to tell my Mum, who is in her seventies, had lost my Dad from cancer and  lives in another country, as I needed to get calm enough to not frighten her too much. I was very upfront then with my friends, told them all that was going on, and they were great. During the scans they also found I had a second cancer in my lung. Again I was upfront with my friends, but only told my Mum a while later, when I also knew the treatment I needed to have. I had a laparoscopy (turned out no cancer), then the mastectomy, and a month later a lobectomy. I refused adjuvant treatment. Just had a check up for the lung, and at the moment all looks good. I would never have made any public disclosure on Facebook, even if I would be a user. But I found telling friends and good neighbours, as well as my family, was very good, as I got a lot of encouragement by this.",
