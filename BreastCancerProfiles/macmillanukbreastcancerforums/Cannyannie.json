      "Content": "Hi Tukis183, I'm so sorry to hear that you have found another lump. I can understand feeling the way you do. I was diagnosed with TNBC in September. I had surgery in October and just last week I found a couple of small lumps. I recently had my 4th out of 6 fec chemo. I contacted the breast nurse who arranged an ultrasound and wide core needle biopsy on Thursday. Turns out I had 3 lumps. Two of these were cysts, the other solid. Awaiting results of the latter. If it turns out to be cancerous, I can only assume that chemo has failed and I have put myself through all of that Hell for nothing. I too feel sick to my stomach with fear. I hope your lump turns out to be nothing. My thoughts are with you.",

      "Content": "Hi Charlielou , I was diagnosed with thbc in September. Had a lumpectomy and sentinel node removed. All clear. Just over a week ago I found two small lumps in the same breast . Waiting for the results of biopsy. Due chemo number 5 on Monday. I too am terrified and confused. I don't know what to think. If it turns out to be something sinister then chemo obvioulsy isn't working. I now wish I'd had a mastectomy. I don't think I am strong enough to cope with more surgery/treatment. My thoughts are with you.x",
