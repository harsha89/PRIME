    "Content": "Hi, I also had mastectomy August. I was dreading it before hand but now it's over and done with I am relieved. Also lymph nodes were removed too. I had the drain in for a week, bit of a pain carrying it around and going to bed lol. A dressing gown with pockets comes in handy. Also the prosthetic lady should see you while in hospital. I mainly wore hospital gown and your chest is strapped up anyway so you don't wear a bra. I was in for 2 nights. Good luck x",
