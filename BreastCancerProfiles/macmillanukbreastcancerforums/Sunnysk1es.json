    "Content": "Hi, I\u2019m New to this !  I first had breast cancer 10 years ago. This was in my right breast and was treated with a mastectomy and diep flap reconstruction followed by two years of tamoxifen.   In January this year I was diagnosed with DCIS in my left breast. I was told I needed another mastectomy.  This I had on 2nd May. Using a double tug reconstruction. My legs are still quite sore and tingly and I wonder if anyone else has suffered from this and has any tips to help the soreness ?   Also I have had lymph nodes out from Both armpits, which causes problems with taking blood and blood pressure!  Has anyone deny tips about this please  Thanks for your help guys  Kim. ",
