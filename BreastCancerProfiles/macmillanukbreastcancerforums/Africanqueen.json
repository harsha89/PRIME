      "Content": "My mom has Stage 3c breast cancer. Had mastectomy, radiotherapy, tamoxifen but told tamoxifen no longer working so taken off 2 months ago. Cancer spread down arm into hand, told inoperable. Now has chronic diahorrea every 2/3 nights. Whole bed affected, the 'night nappies' they give her are useless. Why can this not be treated? Been told 'this is part of your illness'. Can anyone suggest anything at all please ?",

      "Content": "Hello again. My mom has been in hospital for 2 days of tests. Been told tonight that breast cancer spread signicantly and there is nothing further they can do as it is incurable and not responding to any treatment.After begging for some help they have offered her a 3 week course of capecitabine but state after that there is no other treatment available. Does anyone understand this? Will this just prolong her life for a few weeks, months?",
