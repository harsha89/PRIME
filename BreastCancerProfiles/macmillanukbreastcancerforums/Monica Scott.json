    "Content": "I got the Hard Word on the 13th as well, Looby, so unlucky for some.  I'm having the little b***ard out on Oct 7th, but I just wish they'd get it out of me now!  Then I'll have radiotherapy and hormone therapy and then we'll have to see, depending on if it's spread and if they get it all out at one go. I know what you mean about thinking it's got bigger, I'm the same, I keep thinking there's something wrong with the other one too and worrying about my lymph nodes. I got in a state the other day until I realised the odd feeling in my armpits was the armholes on my teeshirt which were too tight and were cutting into me!  Not necessarily affected lymph nodes...every time I have a little twinge I imagine it's another one somewhere else when in fact it's probably just the effects of stress. The worst bit so far for me was waiting to get a definitive diagnosis after the doctor said my mammogram and scan looked like cancer, your life just goes on hold.  Now I just want to get on with it.  It sounds silly but at the moment I'm just trying to ignore it and carry on with life as normally as possible, for as long as possible, and not let this horrible thing take over my life completely. Good luck",
