      "Content": "Hi there Only just seen this thread and unsure completely how this site works as only been here a week, probably one we would never knew existed until this shitty thing filled our lives and minds eh !! Sounds like we are sort of at the same point of diagnosis / worry / stress etc ... I found a lump but after ultra sound found to be 2 small lumps quite close together, like all us complete panic mode set in. Diagnosis a week later was both were cancerous so need an MRI to see if can take out by lumpectomy or mastectomy. My consultant has said chemo is highly unlikely but radiotherapy if anything found in lymph nodes, this is my topic currently as unsure why chemo not likely when lumps not even out yet !! I have a 10 year old and like you I thought hey yeah chemo not likely so done and dusted by Sep !!! I still have no idea where or what is happening but try to take one step at a time even though I am a 'control freak' and want to know when, where, why, how ... Think that's the scariest thing the not knowing and waiting. I have an excellent GP who knows me well so that is helping me a little, not sure if you could go that route for support as well. MRI is tomorrow and had some excellent pre advice etc from CDaniel, another user on here (no idea how to tag people) I don't know where i'd be if not for support from a few people on this site .. they are all amazing and so knowledgeable. I get my partner to remember most things I need to ask then if I should forget he's great at reminding me, also sometimes they think about others things to ask that with your mind currently racing you might not think of !! Sending lots of love your way take care of you. Claire xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",

      "Content": "Hi there I haven't been diagnosed with cancer but have found a lump and had several tests and am awaiting the results tomorrow. I suffer from anxiety at times and think I have  real phobia of cancer. I am so scared as always had it in my head that one day I will get cancer it will have spread and I'll die. This has become worse since had my son 10 years ago. During the ultra sound the lump was found to be 2 lumps 8mm apart so biopsies had to be taken from both. Not sure how I am still functioning and no idea how I am going to be able to walk into the room tomorrow for results ?? Feel guilty as there are so many others so much worse off than me right now, wondered if anyone out there had advice / same feelings .. Thank you in advance.",

      "Content": "Thank you so much for reply KathleenJ, how awful for you to hear that after initial advice. I'm trying not to do too much research as my brain can probably work faster than Google with potential disaster outcomes right now. I was just so shocked that I was a blubbering wreck while everyone else looked outwardly so calm. My partner and sister both coming as hospital an hour away from where we live so long car journey back what ever the news !! I've never been a very positive person and really struggling with everyone saying 'oh sure you'll be fine or it'll be nothing ' finding it a very lonely experience even though everyone being so caring and doing everything they possibly can.   You take loads of care.xxxxx",
