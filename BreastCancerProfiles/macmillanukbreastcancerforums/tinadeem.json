    "Content": "Hello :) I was diagnosed with grade 3 triple negative invasive ductal carcinoma 29 October 2012. I had a wide local excision and sentinel  lymph node removal that showed no lymph node involvement. I had chemotherapy that finished late April 2013 followed by 15 sessions of radiotherapy that ended in June 2013. The radiotherapy caused skin burning and peeling and I also realised around this time that I had crusting of the nipple of the breast I had the cancer in, the other breast nipple is fine. I picked out the crusting, which was painful. It seemed to slowly improve, but I still retain some crusting. I have read about Paget's disease of the nipple having crusting as a symptom, but, I am thinking mine has been caused by the radiotherapy. I will be mentioning it to the breast clinic next week when I go for a check up, but I was wondering if anyone else on this forum has experienced the same thing and had suspected or had it confirmed it was caused by radiotherapy treatment?",
