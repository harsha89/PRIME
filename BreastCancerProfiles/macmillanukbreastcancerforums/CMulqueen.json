      "Content": "Hi Annie Please don't beat yourself up, it's time to treat yourself, our bodies are taking a bashing and I think it's good to give in sometimes.  There was a thread on here about diet etc probably last month, and alot of people after they've finished all their treatment, decide to change their lifestyles.  I must admit, I was thinking yesterday, when this is all over, I'm going to start exercising more etc, hopefully I will do just that, but at the moment, losing your hair, your energy, your tastebuds, just relax, they'll be plenty of time after.  I'm craving a toasted cheese butty but can't taste it yet, but I will have one in a few days, I hope.  I'm still having a drink occasionally, the acidity and fruity taste of wine, tickles my tastebuds and i can actually taste it.  I feel guilty but I was chatting to a fella patient today, who has gone 11 years now and who is also a doctor.  She said \"as we don't know what made us have cancer in the first place, how do we know what to change?\"  I've taken the pill the majority of my adult life, has made me feel guilty.  But my friend said new research suggests that rather than causing breast cancer, it brings it forward.  So I was always going to get it, just got it earlier.  I think my philosophy will be, everything will be fine in moderation, even fish n chips, but learn to love yourself and your life.  I can't stop drinking my beloved rose wine and soda water.  A little bit of heaven in a glass. By the way, I have no idea whats happens to my stupid computer, it has a mind of it's own, if of course this displays as big and small type, if not, please ignore.  P.S I haven't been drinking!

      "Content": "Hi I noticed your post just after, I think, going to the hospital for the same thing.  This Monday I noticed the same feeling in my left leg, in fact I told my parents who were taking me out for the day.  My first chemo session was the Tuesday before, and I thought I'd gotten off light.  My systems were just a constant headache and sleeping tablet hangover feeling. I thought I should now be getting better, but Monday, along with the ache in my leg, I felt nauseous, and breathless.  The breathlessness was worrying but I decided to leave it and see how I felt the next day.  To cut a long story short, after a chest xray on Tuesday and a CT Scan on the Wed, I was told I had multiple small blood clots in my lungs.  I'm injecting every day for 6 mths I'm told.  I've just been on the internet and read up on it, stupid maybe, but it's pretty scary stuff,  I'm glad I went to the hospital, I was going to leave it, to see is it would get worse, and because I don't like bothering people, but I'm glad I did.  I decided to do the injections myself and they really do sting a little bit but at least they do the job. Just love the side effects too...not. Kris",

      "Content": "Hi, I just want to say I can feel for everyone of you on here.  I was where you are in January.  I went into meltdown, cried all day, couldn't eat, sleep, and felt I couldn't go on, my head was out of control.  I had loads of pamphlets I couldn't even read, the word scared me silly.  I came onto this site which freaked me out too, it made it all too real.  How could this be happening to me, other people get cancer not me.  I could not do this, I couldn't face all the treatments, I'd got an MRI scan due in a few days which scared me, (it turned out it was nothing to worry about), but it was all too much.  It took me a few days to sort myself out but eventually you do.  I have lobular cancer which is ER+ and HER+.  It started as being 'subtle' according to my consultant but each time I went back, the news was worse.  This 'subtle' cancer was 5.5cm but with no node activity.  Lobular cancer, I was told, was the best type to have as it's slow growing, but being HER+ made it aggressive, it's also unusual to be HER+ with lobular cancer.  I've had a mastectomy but no reconstruction, I couldn't face it at the time, and since then haven't regretted it. Most of the time I forget about the lack of a breast.  I was more worried about chemo.  I have now had 3 sessions of chemo, (I'm having FEC-T with Herceptin and a trial drug similar to Herceptin) and then 5 yrs of Taxoxifen or similar as I'm menopausal.  Unfortunately after my first chemo session I had a DVT which resulted in a pulmonary embolism, so now I'm on Heparin, but I have to say, other than that, it hasn't been too bad.  I had my last FEC on Tuesday, and I've just asked if I can go into work tomorrow, because I feel so well.  I've been working 2 days a week for the last couple of months. I can't talk for everyone, no-one can, all I can say is, for me it did get easier.  I have learnt to enjoy little pleasures more.  Stress i think, definately plays a part in this disease,   What is disease after all?  Dis - ease.  I try not to let other people's anger worry me, they have no idea what we are going through.  I still have a way to go, Taxotere next time, hopefully the side effects won't be too bad,  then radiation.   For anyone wanting a little help with the emotions, I did go straight onto Citalpram.  I have had depression before and it helps.  It also helps with hot flushes and other menopausal systems which is why the dr put me onto it.  I was on HRT! i do think it's important to find out about your type of cancer, when you're ready.  it helps to understand what's happening in your body and to help yourself get over this awful disease..  It helps also to be good to yourself, be kind to yourself.  It definately changes your life, if not your outlook.  I feel calmer even though I haven't come out the other end yet! Lots of love to everyone.",

      "Content": "Hi Franoli i posted on here about mouth and nose ulcers which I had severely last time with the first tax, but also with FEC.  Try sucking ice cubes when you're having chemo, it actually works.  I haven't suffered a one this time, but have every time before.  Its like magic, it hasn't done anything for my taste buds but at least it's one misery less.  It's strange but I'm fancying sweets and fruits etc. too.  Actually I'm just trying to get any taste at the moment, it's quite depressing but hopefully it'll pass soon.  Do please try the ice cubes, anything is worth a try.  All the best Kris x",
