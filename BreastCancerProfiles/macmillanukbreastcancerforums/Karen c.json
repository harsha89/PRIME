      "Content": "Hi Leen, Sorry to hear that you have just been diagnosed.  It is a lot of information to get in one day. I found a site here that you might find useful to read on nipple reconstruction.  You may have already read it but it explains a bit more about removing the nipple and then having a reconstruction if that is what you decide to do. I have seen a few ladies with this type of reconstruction and then they have gone on to have the surrounding tissue tattooed to resemble the correct skin pigmentation.  It would be a good idea to ask your surgeon whether they could do this. I think it is totally understandable that you should feel this way though. Not everyone gets an MRI or CT scan now.  You should get a contact for a clinical nurse specialist and they are really good at answering questions related to this too.  There is another link on here for diagnosis too. Hope this helps. Karen x",

      "Content": "Hi Mags, Glad that you got to go and see your GP - hope the antibiotics are working.   This link maybe helpful to you, it explains that sometimes dissolvable stitches can take months to go (How long will my stitches last). Radiotherapy will cause a lot of inflammation inside your breast too and part of your bodies natural defence mechanism is to remove foreign objects so your body is probably working very hard to get rid off those pesky stitches.   Radiotherapy side effects can last for a long time after finishing treatment. Here is a link to the cancer research website on radiotherapy long term effects and changes in appearance to skin.  Given that your skin is hot is indication of infection and inflammation so try the antibiotics and see how it goes - they can take a couple of days to work.  It is good that you are due back on Thursday for follow up because they will be able to see if the antibiotics are taking effect.   All the best for tomorrow. Best Wishes, Karen",

      "Content": "Hi Pixidust, Welcome to the site, although sorry you have had to come here.  It is a great place to say how you feel and get support from others on the community. I am glad you have not had to have any further treatment on the left side - that is good, and I really hope you get some good news for the other side too. It is understandable how you feel about the genetic testing.  Especially having two little girls, you are looking out for them.  As I would for my daughter too.  There is a good link on here about genetic testing for breast cancer and a tool called OPERA for assessing your risk. Although the tool is just a guide it gives a lot of information at the end regarding who is at risk.  It also suggests that if the NHS really wont give you the test that you could go private for the test if you really wanted too.  However it is always wise to discuss this with your Clinical Oncologist first as they will be able to advise you better. I hope this helps.  I hope your mum is ok too.  Good for you to get her to go back to the GP. Karen xx",
