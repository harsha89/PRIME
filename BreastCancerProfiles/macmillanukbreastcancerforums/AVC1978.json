    "Content": "chemo brain or general doofus? I\u2019m not sure where this post will appear but if it doesn\u2019t go in the right place any pointers would be appreciated? EC round 2 today. Everything went relatively well eept seeing the wig lady. I\u2019ve been cold capping and about three days ago it started coming out, not in great big handfuls but definitely thinning. I told the wig lady I didn\u2019t want to pay for the witoday as I\u2019m going to persevere, she kind of smirked and said she wouldn\u2019t send them back as she\u2019s sure she\u2019ll be seeing me again. Thanks for that! Harrumph! Some people are in the wrong job! Oh welsanity not vanity I suppose  I have no idea why a number of random letters have been replaced with that emoticon face! ",
