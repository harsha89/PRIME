      "Content": "Hi I had my 1st FEC on 20th Jan so am 8 days ahead of you. I was absolutely terrified waiting for 1st treatment, heart racing think I was in flight or flight mode. I didn't realise that they inject the 3 chemicals into you at the same time as a fast running saline drip is given, thought it was already mixed in a bag of saline. Was expecting the drugs to affect me immediately there and then. As the nurse was injecting the chemicals in told me that I might get a headache and metallic taste with one as it went in. Guess I was lucky as I didn't notice anything. With another injection I might feel pins and needles in my bottom but again didn't feel anything.  Went to the loo immediately after and noticed wee was red, didn't realise it would colour your urine that quickly. 1st day all my veins seemed to look very large and very blue. I had a very red face for 3 days looked like I had sunburn. Couldn't sleep at nigth for 1st few days (but think this might be side effects of sickness tablets they give you)I felt a little sickly on 3rd day, but took tablets and it subsided. Went off my food for 1 day. Got a bit constipated and then after taking senokot went the other way. My tongue went very white about 6 days after injection, and end of tongue went sore for a few days. On about the 4th day, I had anxiety attacks, very jittery and agitated but again think this is the anti-sickness tablets they give yout. Felt very tired on 4/8th day (had a friend call round and found myself nodding off a few times). Had problems with keeping warm, my temp kept going down to 35.5, phoned hospital as instructed as it was below 36, they told me to keep an eye on it and keep warm but no other signs of infection/problems, so think that my core temp is on the low side naturally anyway. Had my birthday on day 6, family came round to see me, stayed a few hours as I was still in tired mode. I'm now on day 13 and feel pretty good,still got my hair (got my wig ready), notice that my mouth goes very dry overnight, so take a glass of water to bed. Seem to be having an outbreak of spots, never suffered with spots before, but on the plus side the little red spider veins on my face seem to be fading. Still a little weary but all in all feel pretty good. Hope they all go as good as this one. 1/6th of way through now, next injection on 10th Feb i'll be 1/3rd of way through. Only thing I can advise is to keep away from people with coughs/infections etc.  I seemed to hit my lowest days 4 to 8 and have perked up since then, even thinking of doing a bit of exercise, gentle walks and wii fit etc. take care and good luck with the rest of your treatment, fingers crossed we are one of the lucky ones who don't have it too bad xx",

      "Content": "Hi Forion and everyone went to hairdressers to get hair shaved, as it started to come out loads, not in clumps but millions of individual hairs, I woke up with a mouthful of hair lol. Had a shower and it took me ages to get every single hair from my head off my body  as it was  sticking too me, drove me crackers . Used hairdryer to dry hair and it was raining hairs, thought I need to get this sorted now as I hate hair in my food. So went to hairdressers, thought I would be brave, but as soon as i got through door started blubbering. My hairdresser took me to a corner  and was very sympathetic and thought it might be easier to have a very short judi dench type haircut rather than a shave, has cut it too about 1inch on top on 1/2 inch on sides. Still coming out loads but think it will be an easier transmission for me. My head is very sore today, feels like when you have had all your hair scraped back from your face in a very tight pony tail all day, and then that sore head feeling when you let it back down again.   Dont know why I have suddenly started typing in italic must have hit a key somewhere. everyone take care xxxx",

Don't know if your mouth feels like mine did but it felt sort of spongy, really strange feeling and then my mouth went very, very dry for quite a few days. 3 days till my 2nd injection, then will be 1/3rd of way through. Got a bit of a sore mouth behind teeth and my gland in neck on same side feels a bit tender, but seems to be getting better bit by bit each day. All in all don't feel too bad. xx ",

      "Content": "Hi everyone Had 2nd chemo on wednesday 10th Feb, arm ached a bit whilst I had injections, and feels a bit sore down side where vein is, but not too bad, can't see anything, bruising or swelling etc. Shaved my hair off- what was left of it the other day, like you Forion I wear a hat to bed. Went to headstart the other day and bought some head scarves, ready tied and a false fringe that you can attach, looks pretty good. wore my wig a few times, but find I get very itchy with it, plus when my hair was coming out I felt head sore, so wig made it worse. Starting to get to my feeling cold stage, appetite still ok, still no metallic taste, but starting to get spongey mouth feeling again, and felt a bit agitated - same as last time, lasts for about 1 day. Watching I don't have spicy food this time, as last time I got heartburn. Well 1/3rd of way through now, 4 more to go. Hope everyone else is ok and coping with chemo. My love to you all. xx    ",

      "Content": "Hi Bev I'm with you,  dread having chemo but wish it would come quicker and quicker just to get to the end. Shame we can't be put to sleep for a few months. Only 9 weeks to go after your next injection and then you will be having your last one (hooray).  At the end of March we would have had our 4th chemo, them only 2 more to go. If we can survive this physically and mentally we can survive anything.  I'm trying to think of it as a very strong anitbiotic, fighting the alien/potential alien cells in our bodies. I dread the 4/5th days after chemo, I always get very jittery and anxious, a real sense of forboading. I know it 's a side effect prob of the steroids as I have had it twice now , but this doesn't make me think rationally at the time and I always seem to get my panick attacks even though I know what is causing them. I'm not doing too bad apart from trouble with my arm, sore veins (been told by my GP it is phlebitis). Hoping this won't stop them giving me chemo on Weds. I'm going to get the nurses to page a member of the consultation team to take a look just to put my mind at rest. Had a bit of a sore nose, but this was my fault. Chance in a million, I  was in the shower washing my face and next thing I accidentally stuck my finger up my nose and cut it on the inside with my nail (I'm not used to long nails). Don't know why but for some reason my fingernails are growing quite long (never had long fingernails before). Enjoy your dinner tomorrow with the family and don't think your alone with feeling depressed, down and anxious, think we all do at some point in time. Lets face it none of us wanted to be going through what we have to, don''t think this was in our dreams of what the future holds for any of us. I think your right to speak to your oncology team re your feelings they might be worse because of the side effects of medication. I think the steroids they give us can cause depression/sadness along with the chemo drugs as well. take care and remember your doing great, your strong minded and a fighter , and the fact that we have turned up for our chemo sessions proves this. We are all going to whop it's ars*. You might feel like running away from the chemo sessions, you wouldn't be normal if you didn't. I and my hubby feel the same. On my 1st one we were seriously considering  turning the car around and going to the seaside for the day. Love to you all xx",

      "Content": "Hi everyone Hope you are all doing ok. I've just spent 15 mins typing a message to everyone only to press the wrong key and lose it all, arrrrrrrrgh!!!!! Well here goes again, had my 3rd Fec today, got doctor to look a my tender arm beforehand, said possible I have a collapsed vein on inside, but not a prob as the body is very good a rerouting blood supply. She doesn't know what the area on the outside of arm is. Looks paler and almost like it is lined on ouside of area with a bruise, but it doesn't hurt. I was worried it was that extravasion (not sure of spelling) but she said I would know if it was for def by now as area would be red, and possibly ulcerated or black and that it would hurt quite a bit and probably start from site of injections, which it doesn't it's on opposite side. Nurse was brilliant this time, used heat pack from the start and sent it through really slow, with a good flush through of saline at end, it didn't ache at all. She asked me if last nurse rushed it through, I'm not sure if she did, don't really look at time, but I'm thinking if she did perhaps she didn't dilute it enough by feeding through slowly so that it roughed up inside of veins. Feel a lot more tired tonight after 3rd chemo then previous ones, perhaps it has a knock on effect. Anyway onto to happier things, a cruise sounds great. we are hoping to book aholiday to Orlando in Oct/Nov time and I'm going to see Harry Potter World at Universal. My friend had her chemo 3 years ago, followed by radio near end of May and went on holiday in July and hair was about 2 inches long, so went without her wig, said it was brilliant not to wear wigs etc. although she did have to wear a sunhat. I tried outfit onfor daughters wedding and no way can I fit it can't get back zip up past waist now. look like I'll have to shop for a new outfit unless a miracle occurs.   well take care ladies, love to you all, keep strong all one day nearer to end of treatment/start and end of treatment.

Said I need to tell nurse at next chemo probs I have had and that they will prob warm arm up a bit moe to open the veins and then give it a really good flush through with saline when I have finished. In my tired stage at moment, mouth ok just feels a bit spongey again, so being careful not to eat anything too sharp. Eating ok and not sleeping too bad. Got a little bit of constipation again and have now gone the other way, same as last time mild diarohhea. Hoping to get a bit more energy in a few days again, so that I can try to loose some weight (have put on about 1/2 stone since started treatment). My daughter gets marrried in June and I needed to have lost 1/2 stone for my dress to be a bit more comfortable, now need to loose 1 stone lol!!  Think the weight gain is just the lack of excercise, at this rate I'll end up buying another outfit!!! My try and do abit on the wii fit, but even as I'm typing this I think prob not, will leave it for a few days, get back on the sofa and have a little snooze I think. Take care everyone, and just think we are all 1 day less through the process than yesterday, or 1 day nearer to starting and then finishing it.   xx   ",

Wish it was possible to be put to sleep for next 4 months and wake up with all treatment completed. Think the steroids have a lot to do with tears, but then again we have all been through so much mentally and physically we wouldn't be human if we didn't feel, anxious, sad or tearful. It's a miserable rainy day here today, so perhaps when spring comes we will feel more energetic. I too eat if I feel a bit nauseous, can't seem too stop eating, but trying to eat things that will help repair my body. I don't seem hyper with the steroids either, just get very drained and then start to buck up again near time of next chemo. I'm sorry to hear about your little dog 'Sam' your bound to be blubbering especially with Sam as well, but like you think steroids have a part to play in how I feel.

I wonder if a very dark purple would work as well??  Had a lovely mothers day, Son & Daughter came round for lunch (pastabake), very tasty, which hubby made. Mothers day present is to have my nails manicured next weekend (on my low blood levels this weekend) , so looking forward to that.   trying to read a book tomorrow, but find that I can't seem to concentrate on anything for very long at the moment. Looking forward to the lighter nights, I hate winter and dark nights, think I have that SAD syndrome. Got hubby to plant some spring bulbs in plant pots to brighten the place up.

      "Content": "Hi abc no problem in following my progress - I'm on day 15 now from 1st injections,  don't feel too bad apart from now have an enormous cold sore on bottom of mouth and under my nose.  Still got my hair, waiting for it too start falling out soon. Have been out to local indoor shopping centres for a walk around as weather been too cold to walk outside. Find I'm very conscious of people coughing and sneezing, and try to keep away from anyone I suspect is not well. Have next injection next Wednesday, am going to hospital day before for a free make-up lesson, they show you how to draw eyebrows etc, just in case I loose mine. My daughter gets married in June so hopefully I will have mastered eyebrows by then (don't want to look like Mr Spock). If not I have seen on the web places that you can buy fake ones from. take care xx",

As mentioned on an earlier thread check with your oncoligist about any supplements you take, as it may stop the chemo working as well as it needs to. In guide to chemotherapy that hospital gave me says probiotic drinks such as actimel, yakult or supermarket own brands should not be drunk while you are having chemo.  take care everyone xx",

Just had my 3rd last week. I take Gaviscon and avoid spicy hot food, but everything seems to set it off. I also sleep in bed with 2 pillows , more sat up, which seems to help a bit.    xx",

      "Content": "Hi Chrissi and ladies, I personally think scans should be yearly. I wasn't due to have my scan till Oct this year. I got diagnosed Nov last year, so think i would have been a lot worse 12 months further down the line. It's a long story but my hubby broke his ankle on holiday (he broke same ankle the year before on holiday as well, going to have to watch him on our next holiday), in Sept 09. I got food poisoning on the same holiday, so both me and hubby ended up at hospital on holiday, he went to fracture clinic I went to A & E. When we came back from holiday my stomach still bothered me, couldn't get into GP's for 11 days, all appointments were full. They wouldn't give me an emergency appointment. I got so annoyed as this is what it is like every time you need to see a Doctor, that I changed GP's, coincidentally as the GP's was a brand new surgery they were calling their patients in for a mammogram (or this is what the radiologist told me, don't know if it is true or not). So I ended up having mammogram nearly 12 months earlier than expected.  I was diagnosed a grade 3 (fast growing type), 3cm's, no lymph node involvement. Had a lumpectomy, and will be having 6 x FEC as insurance against a stray cell shooting of somehere else in the body and then 3 weeks radiotherapy. I think the reason they don't offer mammograms to under 50 is that the breast tissue changes as you get older, it is more dense the younger you are, and under 50 is too dense for the mamogram to show anything. I have  heard that they are trialing for 47 year olds at moment.  I'm going to ask radiologist Doctor, if it will do me any harm to pay for a private yearly mamogram after this is all over. Not due for next checkup with hospital which I guess will be a mamogram till Dec this year, not sure if they then do yearly checkups for 5 years will ask oncologist in April, when I see the again.  My daughter gets married in June and the other motherinlaw to be was diagnosed with BC nearly 5 years ago, less than .5cm, grade 1, had lumpectomy and radio and now nearly finished taking hormonal therapy. My old school friend got diagnosed 3 years ago with a 6cm lump, had mastectomy, chemo and radio etc. and on hormone therapy. has anyone used the new breast light that Boots Chemist are selling, is it supposed to be any good? Keep strong everyone xx",

      "Content": "Hi Connor371 Welcome to our group, sorry you find yourself here. I'm sure there will be someone in our group that has a similiar diagnosis to youself. Everyone  feels scared having their 1st chemo. I did, didn't know what to expect, thought I would be throwing up from the start, off my food, losing weight and feeling like death. I was scared to death of possible side effects, this is my worst nightmare as I don't even like taking paracetamol for headaches, hate taking medication of any type. Everyone experiences different side effects, and I have to say up to now i seem to be one of the lucky ones and have got off light. Worst side effect for me is tiredness, heart burn and weight gain. After the 1st session, knew what to expect so they dont seem as bad 2nd time round. I had FEC = 6 sessions, due my 4th session next weds. I have trouble with my veins, they are very deep I have been told which I think is a polite way if the nurse telling me I have to much fat over them (I am overweight and even more so now as have put on about 9lbs since started chemo). At my last chemo I took my own hot water bottle and a flask of hot water to fill it with, so that i could warm my veins up whist sat in waiting room (session before they only had 2 hotpacks in entire ward so ended up trying to warm my hand on radiator. I also drink plenty of water in the morning before chemo to plump veins up, as I think if you are dehydrated the veins shrink. I was diagnosed as a 3cm tumour (had a lumpectomy), grade 3, which is most unlike normal cells and 3 lymph nodes which were tested came back clear. I ws also highly estrogen receptive 7 out of 8 which means that my cancer thrived on estrogen to feed it. I will be taking some sort of hormonal drug to reduce the amount of etrogen my body produces. My friend was diagnosed over 3 years ago and she had a 6cm tumour, needed a mastectomy, lymph nodes were involved, and grade 3, most unlike normal cells, She also had chemo and radio and takes a hormonal suppression medicine for 5 years. If you look on macmillan website on below link it tells you about staging etc.  http://www.macmillan.org.uk/Cancerinformation/Cancertypes/Breastfemale/Symptomsdiagnosis/Stagingandgrading.aspx Take care and you will get plenty of support from all the lovely ladies in this group.

      "Content": "Hi Chrissie & all the girls I had my lumpectomy beg of dec. At 1st thought they hadn't got all of the lump out (although they asured me they had) as it still felt hard. Gradually the swelling and hardness has gone, and can hardly feel anything now. In fact operated breast feels softer than the other one. Can just see a red scar  now on breast and under arm. Was able to sleep on stomach about 8 weeks after op. Personally I think a lot of people use forums for support and to be prepared for what could possibly happen positive and negative. My friend was diagnosed 3+ years agoand didn't want to know anything about side effects etc. I'm the opposite sort of person that likes to read up on everything, get ready for battle and also for reassurance that the side effect I'm experiencing are being experienced by other people and that they have got through it. For instance hospital didin't mention that my face would go bright red for a few days due to steroids. I thought it was my blood pressure going high (I suffer with high blood pressure) and I was really worried that I was going to have a heart attack. Felt a lot better when it was mentioned on forum that someone else had same symptoms. I've got off pretty light with side effects up to now and fingers and toes crossed this will continue. have my 4th FEc on Wednesday, looking forward to getting another one out of the way (2/3rds of way through then), but have started with the sleepless nights again as usual. As mentioned earlier in  threads I hate taking medication of any kind. Don't even like taking paracetamol etc. so this is my nightmare. Love to you, and good luck with your next chemo's, another one out of the way.",
