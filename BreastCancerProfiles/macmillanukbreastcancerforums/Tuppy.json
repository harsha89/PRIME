      "Content": "Still waiting in limbo for my biopsy next week.  Only just been brave enough to pick up and read the literature the hospital gave me last thursday.  Read that it cant be done beyond 28th day of menstrual cycle (counting 1st day of period as day one).  Does this basically mean they wont do the procedure whilst your having your period?  My mind is clouded and Im struggling to think straight or make sense of anything.  My emotions are all over the place, eldest son has noticed and started to question whats wrong.  Husband (who knows whats going on) keeps asking whats wrong... I feel like screaming and telling him not to be so stupid, but I cant bring myself to talk about it.  Its almost as hes forgotten and Im carrying a huge weight around with me, trying to carry on as normal, failing dismally.  Dont know how Im going to get thru this last week of term.  I only work part time but the week is dragging already. Had been hoping I may hear from hospital with nipple discharge results, but nothing. T x",

      "Content": "Hi, thanks for replies. My children are 14.5, 11 & 7.  Eldest currently doing mock GCSE's so I dont want to stress him out anymore.  Middle one soon to be doing his SAT's.  Im not quite ready to open that can of worms yet.  As said, I really want to know whats what and how it will be dealt with before I sit them down and explain whats going on.  Husband always seems to ask me whats wrong (in a real pissed off way) in front of the kids; otherwise I think I would have exploded at him by now. I dont live near my family and I dont feel ready to dump this on them, they'd only worry sick cause they arent close by.  My dad has had cancer twice, bowel and stomach and still here to tell the tale; however I know they wont take my news well, if its what I expect. Ive only told one trusted friend (as I needed someone to drop youngest at school whilst going for my mam) but not really had chance to talk much with her shift work and our busy family lives.  I didnt want friends to panic, flap and start advertising the news; at the moment I want it to be a private issue. After searching about I found this forum and it seemed full of such lovely brave ladies who inspire me to try to be strong even tho I feel like a headless chicken. Still non the wiser about about where in the menstrual cycle I 'can't' be for the biopsy.  To be honest I only have a rough idea when my periods are due.  I stopped keeping track after being sterilized after last child.  I seem to be strangely calm this afternoon!

      "Content": "Had my biopsy yesterday.  Wasnt as bad as I expected, seemed never ending tho, they took 9 samples in all.  Not sure if thats a good or bad sign?  The wound has bled alot so Ive made an appointment to see the nurse at my GP to get dressing changed - thought if it has to be on there for 3 days then better to get a fresh one as the current one is very soiled. Emotionally feeling numb today.  Want to cry but theres nothing there.  Results in a week from the biopsy and hopefully the discharge results too - had been hoping they would tell me those yesterday but I was told they'd give me all the results together. Had hoped a bit of retail therapy would take my mind off things today but my little girl refuses to go! - was the mention of walking to town that put her off.  Feel alone and isolated. T x",
