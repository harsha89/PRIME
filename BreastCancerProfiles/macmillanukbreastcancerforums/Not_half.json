      "Content": "I am a single lady of 42 and am currently doing chemo on my own.   I have a few close friends who I have made an extra effort to stay in touch with as they have been great when needing company during chemo and keeping up social contact while I am unable to work.  I had three rounds of AC chemo first, which made me very poorly but friends and family were on the end of a phone call to support me emotionally. I didn't feel like I wanted anyone around in person during those days when I took to my bed but it was lovely having people texting to check in, knowing I may not get back to them right away. I also have a private Facebook group with a specially selected group of friends and family where I share updates and a few giggles. ",

How fast it is growing and whether there is spread to the lymph nodes are also key, and whether it is hormone receptive. Best thing to do in my opinion would be to go over all your results so far with the breast surgeon or oncologist. Take a list of questions and a friend who can help you listen and take notes.

And yes, I do know that breast cancer takes women who follow the conventional path, it took my mum at age 46. I'm also sure it takes many more who don't follow that path. Whether we do or do not we will remain in fear that it may recurr or metastasize. Alternative treatments do not remove the fear. Good luck to anyone who wants to take another path, but I am afraid I am on the side of those who believe our medical teams know what they are talking about and I intend to end this year having at least removed the cancer with which I started it.",
