      "Content": "Hi I'm new here and just wanted to say that I have been having horrendous pain in my arm, shoulder and collar bone since I had my operation. 4 years ago I had a lump removed, and a full node clearance on my right side, I had 4 weeks radio therapy and also take tamoxifen. At first the pain was just now and again , but last year I had a fall and landed on my right hand, this caused lymphadoema, and my arm swelled to 26 per cent bigger than my left. It also is in my back, which has also swollen on my right side. I now have the pain nearly all the time, even walking a short distance starts it. I have been to the breast clinic on loads of occasions but all they kept saying was it was nerve damage. I have just been prescribed tramadol, which is not taking it off, and amitriptyline, but it says on the leaflet don't take amitriptyline with tramadol. Any suggestions please before I go mad with this pain .",

      "Content": "Thanks mistymoley, I have felt so alone lately with having this horrible pain, it gets like your scared of saying anything for fear of the doctors and nurses thinking your a moaner. Honestly I'm not, but it has got to the point now where the pain has took over my life. I work on a till for a supermarket, and I used to work 4 days a week, 6 hour a day. I had to cut that to 3 days when the pain got more intense, but I was spending my days off resting in bed to ease the pain, now I have had to be off work again as can only walk a short distance before it starts. I have had 5 children and always worked, I just want my life back, my children are grown with 2 still at home. They caught me crying the other day and it really upset them. I am a little angry as I have told them every time I have been to the breast clinic and now I feel as if no one took any notice and it has got to this point. I'm sorry for going on as I know that some people are a lot worse off than me and my heart goes out to them, but I just don't know how to deal with this I feel at rock bottom. Thanks for listening, well reading",

      "Content": "Hi all, and thanks for the advice. You are right mistymoley, I am going to have to get a grip on this and stop feeling guilty for asking for help. I suppose when people I speak to keep saying I'm lucky, I know how lucky I am to be alive, but I am not living at the moment, it is taking its toll on my marriage too. I am going to the doctors on the 20th, I can't get in before that, and I am going to tell her that I have to have this sorted out. It's ok saying it could be nerve damage, I want to know what it is, because as you all know we can't face the unknown. I'm so glad now that I came on here as I was getting so desperate, and knowing I'm not the only one with this problem has helped, I thought I was going mad. So thank you all and I wish each and every person on this site my best wishes and hopes for the future x",

      "Content": "Thanks for your hug. I have had physio and it made it worse, I had 4 weeks of it and I had to spend 3days in bed with a heated microwave bag to try an d ease the pain. I have also had a bone scan, that was ok. The pain has been a lot worse since I fell and developed the lymphodema , it starts in my back where the swelling is and comes down the back of my arm, under my arm, across my shoulder and collar bone, in my chest and neck. I have tried all the exercises but it sets the pain off, I also have a sleeve to wear which restricts my movement. I am off work again as I can only walk to the top off my path before it starts, and it gets so severe it makes me sick. I know I'm lucky, but there has to be something wrong for me to be in so much pain.",
