    "Content": "Hi karen20 I am so sorry to hear that your mastectomy is not healing.  I too had mastectomy and implant and the wound kept breaking open with lots of fluid coming out.  I regularly had the seroma drained, but ended up having to have surgery two further times and the implant removed.  Eventually after 4 months it started to heal, but only after I was given a negative pressure dressing.  I am sure time played a part in the seroma eventually becoming less, but the negative pressure dressing seemed to me to be the thing which eventually enabled the two sides of the wound to knit together and hold together.  If you haven't been offered one of these, please ask your surgeon, and keep asking until you get one.  Other than that I can't really offer much help, but you have my sympathy and support and I really hope that your poor body stops producing so much fluid so that your surgery can heal.  Take it easy and all good wishes, Kate.",
