      "Content": "Hi Claire, I had my first chemo last Friday, I had EC and have to say the experience wasn't as bad as I'd anticipated, the actual process of it flowing through my veins only took about an hour and wasn't painful.  My husband and I had a good laugh with the cancer nurse and time flew by. However the side effects have been awful.  I have felt fatigued and dizzy and it doesn't appear to be improving.  I had expected to feel a little better day by day.  Fortunately I haven't been sick, not yet anyway.  Tomorrow is my last day of taking steroids and I am hoping then I'll start to feel more like me. I have been eating little and often and think this has helped me not to be sick, steroids do increase the appetite but if you eat slowly and little and often then piling weight on shouldn't be a problem, or so I'm told.  I have found tea and coffee taste awful and have been mostly drinking fruit juices and cordials.  If I want a hot drink I have hot ginger cordial, ginger is supposed to help you not feel sick. Do you have good support at home?  I do hope so, as I don't know what I'd have done the last few days without help from my husband and family.  I would certainly have struggled to make myself meals, though I can summon the energy for simple things like boiled egg and toast. Do remember though everyone reacts differently, and you may not feel fatigued, I hope you don't.  The main thing to do is what your body tells you, if you feel tired go to bed no matter what the time.  Do not try and fight it is what my chemo nurse told me.  I'm also led to believe that after day 10 I will definitely start feel more human, and possibly before. I had my sentinel node biopsy only a week before my chemo and wonder if that has contributed to me feeling so rough.  My tumour hasn't been removed yet as my oncologist is hoping it responds to chemo and shrinks.  Try not to worry about Wednesday, honestly it isn't so bad.  I wish you well and hope your side effects are minimal.  Good luck and let us know how you get on, but I'm sure it will be fine.  The chemo nurses are wonderful and more than happy to answer any questions and allay your fears, they also offer a great back up system, so don't worry you will be in good hands. Best wishes",

Today I scrutinised my cut and it appears to go from my tumour toward my armpit, maybe this is why I am still in a lot of pain?  I have always in the past had a strong pain threshold, and this is why I couldn't understand why I was feeling my pain to be almost unbearable, but considering what you have said and the fact that my incision goes from the tumour to the sentinel lymph node I now understand my pain is normal. Thanks too for the tip on how to navigate the site, eg info button. Much appreciated, from a very grateful fellow sufferer. Kind regards, Libby",

I wish you well with your op and the radiotherapy.  You sound very positive which will give you the strength needed for the next stages of your treatment.  I hope I can approach all my treatment in the way you have done.

If I cope with chemo as well as you I shall be happy.  I hope you continue to feel better each day and become stronger in readiness for your next session. Yes, I have wonderful support.  My husband is doing all the cooking and food shopping, he's a chef so more experienced than me.  I have two great daughters', one lives close by, but the other is in the South and we are in the North.  My daughter in the South is coming up beginning of October, and both daughters' and I have a wig shopping trip planned, we anticipate making light of it and having a giggle. Thanks so much for your comments, it is good to hear of others' experiences. Good luck, and please keep me up to date with your progress. Libby",

My chemo prescription is EC and I do feel nauseous for the first few day after chemo has been administered, but I haven't been sick.  The steroids (I think they're to blame) make me feel agitated and I don't sleep well the days I take them, they also increase my appetite which in turn upsets me as I feel like a glutton. It was interesting to read the comments re blurred vision as my vision was affected last week (had 2nd chemo Friday 21st Oct), but I hadn't made the association to steroids. You are all right of course; I must raise my concerns with my oncology team, not take it upon myself to stop taking them. Thanks to you all, your comments have been most helpful.",

I was prescribed eye drops last chemo session they are the type for dry eyes, and though they have helped they haven't stopped my eyes running completely.  Perhaps they would help you too, the name is 'hypromellose'.

I personally wouldn't consider going abroad whilst still having chemo as believe it's better to be safe than sorry.  I do though admire you for your positivity and your refusal to give in to your illness. Only you can decide what's best for yourself, and if you think the holiday will help you cope better with chemo then it could be something to consider, but as the previous poster has said circumstances may dictate what you are able to do.

Has anyone else had the same problem, and if so were you given anything to alleviate the pain? Gosh, I can't believe how cruel Docetaxol is, of course if it's efective in shrinking my lump the pain will have been worth it, I think!!

Kelly, thanks for your comments they give me hope.  I feel like you - had I known how I'd suffer I would have thought twice about having chemo, particularly as I was told today that I'm scheduled to have three more cycles of Docetaxol, after my next chemo I'll have another MRI scan and if my lump hasn't shrunk then I'll be taken off chemo.  I have to keep positive and believe it will work, otherwise I'll have gone through the ordeal of chemo for nothing.  Has this happened to anyone else - chemo didn't work?  What a flipping depressing thought to think I may have been punished severely by chemo, and still need to have a mastectomy! I'll get some Piriton Kelly, thanks for the tip, I was prescribed Difflam and it does help a little, yes. I'm looking forward to all this being behind me, for some light at the end of the tunnel.

Had my first Taxotere last Thursday, first injection on Friday and subsequent injections yesterday and today, I opted to inject myself rather than a District Nurse call for five days. Last night I began to feel uncomfortable, I had pains in my hands and top of my legs, today I've felt totally exhausted and I'm in so much pain I could scream!  My mouth feels like a sewage and is sore, this is bearable, but the exhaustion, pain in my fingers, feet, legs and back are driving me to insanity.  I also have pains in my tummy caused by constipation, which isn't fully eased even after taking my prescribed Med's. Initially I was told I'd be having six cycles of chemo. I'd be started on EC and my prescription would be changed if EC had no or little effect in shrinking my lump.  Last Thursday the nurse who administered my chemo said I was down for eight sessions, he was very vague and said he'd check for me and let me know - I didn't see him again!!!  I'm now in total ignorance, I don't know whether I have to have another five cycles of Taxotere, or another two and then a different prescription, infact truth be known I know very little. All the uncertainty is getting me down, which I know is not good as we keep being reminded how important staying positive is, but how does one stat positive when feeling under informed?",

My hair started to come out in clumps on day 11 of my first chemo, on day 16 I asked my daughter to shave my head as it was distressing seeing my hair on my pillow and in the shower, also from a hygeine point of view I wanted rid of it as it was falling out in the kitchen too.  After my head was shaved I felt so much better.  To be honest losing my eyebrows and eyelashes upset me more than not having head hair.  In the house I go commando or wear a turban, and plonk my wig on to go out.  I've become quite adept at faking eyebrows - there's a good video tutorial on You Tube here's a link ............. http://www.youtube.com/watch?gl=SG&feature=related&hl=en-GB&v=U4lajZWeEyE   You will come to accept your bald head (if you do lose all your hair) and within no time be used to it.  Is your hair long?  If it is long I'd suggest having it cut shorter to give it strength, as you may then with the aide of the cold cap hang on to a lot of it.  At your next chemo session ensure the cap is fitted properly - I've heard of ladies losing their hair because the cap didn't fit tight enough. Try not to worry, and do contact your BCN for her advice.  If you do lose your hair it's ot the end of the world, hair grows back. Good luck and take care. Libby x",

      "Content": "Hi Lellis, I note you live in West Yorks, I live in Leeds and am being treated by the NHS.  Mid August, I attended the Breast Care Unit at LGI and had a mammogram, ultrasound and biopsy, all were performed on the one afternoon and I was treated with kindness, compassion and respect.  A week later I returned for a core biopsy and a meeting with a Registrar, the Registrar, a lady with the human touch gave me the result of the biopsy - a 5cms tumour, hormone negative, she took time to fully explain exactly what this meant and even apologised for being the deliverer of this shocking news.  I was then introduced to my Breast Care Nurse who took myself and my husband to a very comfortable private sitting room where I was made to feel at ease, Kath, my BCN, was able to answer all questions I put to her and she offered lots of information regarding what would happen, in what order and the reasons why.  Kath gave me her telephone number and said I could ring anytime to speak with her, if she was unavailable I could leave a message on her phone and she would return my call ASAP. A few days after, we took a planned holiday to Italy and returned mid September which did delay my treatment, but I needed the holiday and the Breast Care Team agreed a holiday would be good for me.  An appointment was arranged for me to have a consultation at LGI with an Oncologist who talked me through my treatment regimen, again with a very relaxed approach giving me time to digest all I was being told and ready to answer any of my concerns, or fears.  I was admitbted to LGI on 23rd Sept for a sentinel lymph node biopsy, Kath rang me a few days later and gave me the result of the op - good news all lymph nodes proved negative.  I began my Chemotherapy at Bexley Wing, St James' on 30th Sept.  The Bexley Wing is a fantastic modern Oncology Unit, ALL staff I have encountered are truly wonderful.  A few days after my first chemo infusion I fainted twice and was admitted to a ward on Bexley Wing, I could not have been cared for better, or quicker, I was immediately given intravenous antibiotic and glucose, and every necessary test was carried out, eg - urine, bloods, bloodpressure, chest xray and ECG.  I have been allocated a Chemo Nurse whom I can ring for help or advice, and she too is a little marvel.  Thursday last week I had my 4th chemo infusion; my first two chemo's were EC, this was changed to Docetaxol for my third cycle.  I really suffered with bad side effects for most of the 21 days following my first Docetaxol; it got to the point at day four of my cycle when I felt so desperate I didn't think I would summon the strength to go through it again, I rang the Bexley Unit and was given a telephone discussion with a Chemo Nurse (mine was on holiday), the Nurse listened to my complaints of aches and pains etc, she calmed me down - I had been hysterical - and explained that there was lots of help I could be offered; she said she would fax a prescription to my GP for strong painkillers and other med's, and advised I take a list of all side effects to my next clinic appointment to discuss with my Chemo Nurse, this I did, and the upshot was the Nurse spoke with my Onc who agreed to lower the dosage of my Docetaxol by 20% and spread my dosage of Steroids across more days, these changes have a made a big difference, I am now on day eight of my 2nd Docetaxol cycle, and my side effects though unpleasant are do-able. So, to sum up my experience of the NHS in Leeds: I do not believe I could have been treated faster, more professionally, more compassionately, more kindly or with more respect.  Kath, my Breast Care Nurse still rings me from time to time to ask how my treatment is progressing, and she is genuinely interested.  Susan, my Chemo Nurse, always returns my left messages quickly, never hurries our conversations and always answers my questions.  When my chemo is finished (can't wait), I'll be having either a lumpectomy or a mastectomy (whichever is necessary) at LGI, and my nursing contact will once again be Kath - so continuity.  I cannot praise enough the standard of care and treatment I've received, well done Leeds, and well done NHS. Lellis, I'm pleased you have decided to use both private and NHS as I'm sure you can take the best from both. I think you may find this an interesting read, it's a lady's blog, the lady was treated by both Spire Leeds and NHS, she praises both highly.  http://suzettesblog-suzette.blogspot.com/ I take this opportunity to wish you a journey as smooth as possible, please keep us informed of your progress, good luck. Also good luck to everyone else about to start chemo. Take care everyone, hugs all round.",

Or you could try calling the Macmillan helpline for advice on ... 0808 808 0000.   I'm sure they will be sympathetic and offer you advice as to who to contact. Good luck.",
