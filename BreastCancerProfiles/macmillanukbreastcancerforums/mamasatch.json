This is also to check out a swelling just above my left coller bone which was found in Nov at yearly review but was told only to contact them if it persisted or got bigger, ( which it has ) .  My cancer was on my right breast as is the swelling in my arm and neck swelling on the left as was my sister's.  Im really worried as my sister didnt make it after her neck lymphs were involved as it rapidly spread everywhere.

      "Content": "Thanks everyone for ur advice. I do know there are more side effects to chemo than losing my hair. I have read up on here and breast cancer care a lot of info. I know too that radiotherapy isnt a breeze either but if it kicks its butt then fine. I watched my sister go through a terrible year before she passed it had spread everywhere and I want a fighting chance. A terrible family history as gran had 5 girls of which 3 had breast cancer including mum,s identical twin and my mum had 3 girls , 2 out of 3 with breast cancer. I worry for myself my daughters and 5 granddaughter's ( so far ) . When will this end? ",

Didn't tell my husband till day before and my kids don't know yet. My husband and eldest son are offshore and didn't want to worry them as not safe out there. All mixed up with info.",

      "Content": "Thanks Dorithee. I have told my husband as he knew I was going for results although as I said I only told him the day before about the biopsy etc. It's my eldest son I need home before I tell him and my 3 other children. He should have been home today but freezing conditions made it impossible. My husband is a radio op so not on rig floor much. My son on the other hand works with the drillers so needs his mind on the job and not me for his safety and for the safety of others. I have confided in a few good friends as I would be a basket case by now if I didn't. It's so difficult looking into my children's faces and keeping this from them but I have to tell them all together. Thanks for being so kind and replying. Xx",
