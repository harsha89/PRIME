      "Content": "Hi Medusa, I like your spirit. I shaved my hair off too when it really started to fall out. My sister in law bought me a bottle of champagne and we sent it off in style. I'd been so upset about it that she felt I ought to try to turn it into something more positive and to mark the moment. What was a very difficult day turned into something lighter and more positive. I sent my hair off with a glass of bubbles and vowed that I wasn't going to let this beat me. Good luck x",

      "Content": "Hi sr23 I've got the same problem as you. I've been prescribed Tranexamic Acid which are tablets that reduce heavy blood flow during menstruation. I take them from the moment my period starts and they have really helped. I'm on FEC and they don't interfere with that. By the way, I was told by my chemo nurse not to use tampons - risk of toxic shock syndrome. Just another thing I had to add to the list of things I can't do. Managing heavy periods without them is not fun. Hope you get some help. X",

I don't think of myself like that but their messages have really touched me and made me think 'yes we are tough' and you're right madhatter, we should celebrate ourselves. I'll be getting the chocolates out later. Happy Womens Day everyone x",
