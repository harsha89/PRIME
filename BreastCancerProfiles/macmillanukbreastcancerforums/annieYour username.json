      "Content": "Hi Lulu, I'm still a bit flabbergasted that they are so against a double mx for 'cosmetic' reasons but gladly put us through these complicated recon procedures for the same reason! Presumably you dont want to hang about too long for cancer treatment? Is asking for the single mx now and considering your options in your own time possible?  There will be pros and cons - you need to seek information. I took a few months to decide, but I had already had my initial cancer treatments so there wasnt any great urgency.  Lots of women have better results than mine with the DIEP and an easier recovery. I wouldnt want to influence anyone else's decision. Good luck xx",

      "Content": "I reported this thread to the moderator some time ago because I was so concerned that women with invasive breast cancer 'dip' in at random and may conclude that 'alternative' 'treatments' may be useful for them and the NHS offerings are lacking. MacMillans have not responded to my concerns, so I will try and outline them now. The majority of breast cancers diagnosed are invasive cancers which will spread and kill you sooner or later. DCIS are a minority. To put it bluntly, those of us with invasive BC would trade it in for DCIS any day, especially the highly aggressive like TN. (That is not to disregard the impact of Any type of diagnosis, I hope you can see my comment in context. It is not intended to belittle Any disease. DCIS may become invasive).  Your clinicians in the NHS do conventional treatments because they have a proven track record. Their duty to provide evidenced based care prevents them recommending unproven, non/under researched, possibly dangerous substances (thank goodness!). If you have invasive BC dont even waste your precious time thinking about forgoing or taking a pick and mix approach to treatments. Its your decision, but if you want hard facts to guide your choices, ask the experts - the professionals and/or try Breast Cancer Care site (which is moderated). They have experienced breast cancer clinicians who can answer specific questions or worries about your treatments.",

      "Content": "Hello Lulu, thanks for sharing your thoughts about mastectomy and reconstruction. I can see exactly where you are coming from. I have heard other women say they didnt like being 'lop-sided after single mx. I really dont get how this doesnt seem to be considered a good reason for having them both off if you dont want reconstruction. Furthermore, once you've had invasive BC in one breast, you have an increased risk of getting it in the other. My initial reaction on diagnosis was 'take it off', but I ended up having WLE, leaving a painful boob with no nipple sensation, so what was the point? I tested +ve for a BRCA2 fault after my BC treatment and had double mx and DIEP recon 8 months ago. I struggled with the decision, as I did not want to spend any extra time recovering from massive surgery when the cancer might come back and kill me early anyway (I'm 56). In the end I had to search my real wishes, live as though I will survive, and went for it. I would not recommend it unless you are sure you would rather have 'foobs' than nothing at all there. My skin does feel warm and has sensation, but they dont look like my real ones. They continue to be tender and painful, and the cancer side has hard lumps. I developed severe frozen shoulder (which I did have signs of after the cancer treatments). I did have a flabby tum, but the tummy tuck has pulled my pubic area upwards, my abdomen is still tender and tight, and not flat - it bulges out on one side. I dont regret the surgery, but I think the recovery is downplayed. I'd still rather stick out in front than be flat. I'm not scared of dying either, but I hope I havnt traded quality time for a franken-bod! Its your body and you have perfectly rational reasons for your request. I hope you get want you want without a hard fight - the cancer is enough to cope with xxx",

      "Content": "Ace208 and Lavendergirl, Thank you for your facts and reasoning. I'm here because of concern that none are being injected by the hosts. A summary may be helpful: Chloe was diagnosed in 2012 with DCIS. She declined recommended lumpectomy, but accepted Anastrozole then Letrozole. The cancer has progressed. CT and bone scans suggest there is no evidence of metastases (incurable cancer) yet. If you had to choose one type of breast cancer treatment, lumpectomy would poll high as the least worst. However, mastectomy may now be the necessary surgical offering. Sorry to hear about your stroke Chloe. It is fortunate the damage was limited to one eye. You said dangerously high blood pressure was the cause. Were you advised that it could happen again if your blood pressure is not controlled?",

      "Content": "Hello Ghost44 I'm really sorry to read your story, you have been really unlucky and I can only imagine how you must be feeling. I had triple negative bc in 2013. Very similar to you, after the lumpectomy they found 2 tumours grade 2 & 3. I had chemo to shrink the tumour before surgery. Then radiotherapy, when I got my brca2 result. Then ovaries and double mastectomy/recon. The chemo was the worst thing. I was terrified they would find cancer after mastectomy, but luckily my pathology came back clear. I phoned Breast Cancer Care helpline (0808 800 6000) numerous times for advice about cancer treatments and I recommend you do the same. None of us on these forums are qualified to give personal cancer medical help and advice, each person's situation is different. When you speak with Breast Cancer Care you will get straight onto a specialist, who will help you think about your options in a helpful and informed way. You didnt say what type of IDC you have. Was the first one ER+ve? This one may be another type.  See https://www.breastcancercare.org.uk/ I was unhappy with the breast surgeon at my local hospital (great surgeon, poor manner). After the cancer treatment I got in touch with National Hereditary Breast Cancer Helpline (01629 813 000), who put me in touch with other brca ladies nearby. As a result, my GP supported me to transfer to a different hospital and I feel much more reassured that they will monitor me appropriately. NHBCH also have a network of shops where you may also find someone talk to. See http://www.breastcancergenetics.co.uk/ There is also a BRCA UK Facebook group which you may find helpful. I do help this is helpful and I send you gentle virtual hugs and best wishes xxx",

I've always tried to do yoga type stretches first thing every morning on physiotherapist advice following a back muscle injury. I used to attend yoga classes weekly for many years until a new job on the same night put paid to that. Anyway, I went back to the class last week and this week, and my goodness, what a difference to doing the exercises on your own at home! Do you have a class near you? Tai chi or gentle pilates is also worth trying.If you havnt been to a class before, persevere. A good teacher will ensure you are in the right position. Dont try and keep up with the rest of the class. A good teacher will accommodate everyone's differing abilities. Dont get freaked out if they do the 'ommmm' chanting at the end. Its quite nice to listen if you dont feel like joining in. Finally, it is obligatory that a least one person will have a fart attack at some point during the class, so try not to giggle!",

      "Content": "Hi Sandy, This problem is very common. I have it with natural menopause. Look at the Breast Cancer Care charity forum, Living with and beyond breast cancer, sex & relationships. There are several detailed discussions (which I contributed to under a different user name). My gynae says local oestrogen creams are OK to use, he acknowledges the breast surgeons may not agree. I didnt like it anyway, so wont use again. The key is continual moisturisation, not just when you're anticipating sex, (you moisturise your face every day) and gradual 'accommodation' of your partner. Amiele dilators are available on px for this purpose, but I refuse to spend £40 approx of public money for 3 bits of plastic, I'll find a substitute!!! (If anyone has tried them, please tell me if my description is wrong). Hope this helps xx",
