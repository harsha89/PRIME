    "Content": "Do you happen to know if HER2+ secondary breast cancer in liver would be useful for the Oncotype DX test?  I seem to remember when I had the breast cancer, it would not have helped but can't remember.  There is a new system called Genostics which is probably similar and again I don't know if I would be a suitable candidate for this test.  I am very, very fearful of chemo as so often it does not work AND you feel terrible in the meantime.  I had Proton Therapy in December for the 3 visible tumours but have other tiny dots showing on the M R I.  Thanks Sheila",
