I was given a bunch of leaflets but I've been too freaked out to read any of them yet. I think I saw something about a cold cap in one of them but glossed over it.

      "Content": "I have to confess I didn't even know what 'neadjuvant' meant!! But that is the plan for me too. I have a grade 3 tumour that is 24mm with spread to 'multiple' lymph nodes. I will be having my CT scan on 13th August to see if the cells have spread anywhere else. I don't have my Her2 results yet (but I have no idea what they mean!!). I won't be staged until after the CT scan. I've been told I will have 6 sessions of chemo with 3 weeks in between each. Scan after the 2nd session to make sure it is doing what it should be doing (with a possibility to change chemo at that point if it's not working?), a scan after the 5th session and then lump and tissue removal after all that. I did question it as, right now, I want the cancer gone so couldn't understand why they can't cut it out right now but they explained that it is better to shrink it first so less tissue has to be removed afterwards. And because it is in my lymph nodes I will need a 'whole-body' solution! They have already put a marker clip in to the centre of my tumour so that, if the chemo works as well as they hope, the correct area of tissue can be removed after finishing the course. Sounds like we are at similar stage of our journies... stay in touch xxx",

      "Content": "Hi All, I'll apologise in advance for this essay... I really feel as though every waking moment is part of a hideous nightmare. The only respite I get is a few hours sleep (aided by sleeping tablets) at night. The moment my eyes open I am straight into the panicky, sick, fear-fuelled day. I never thought I'd be here... but here I am! My name is Nikki and I am 41 years old. About a month ago I found a lump in my right breast after having an achy/bruised feeling in my armpit for a few days. Went straight to the dr who didn't think it was anything to worry about and as I was mid-cycle said it was probably hormonal. She told me to come back in 2 weeks and it would probably be gone. I went back 2 weeks later and the lump was still there. She said she still wasn't concerned as it was small, round and moveable and because I had associated pain (it hurt when it was touched) it was unlikely to be breast cancer but she referred me to the breast clinic (saying it is most likely a cyst and they'd drain it and that would be that). That appointment was last 10 days ago and after a mammogram that showed 'thickening' and an ultrasound that showed a suspicious lump, I had 3 biopsies taken and was told to expect a diagnosis of breast cancer. We went back this Thursday for the results and it is indeed breast cancer, grade 3 and also showing in my lymph nodes (multiple lymph nodes according to the pathology report). I've been told it doesn't respond to hormones and that I will need chemo followed by lump removal. They have put a clip into the centre of the tumour (which is 24mm) so that if the chemo works really well they won't lose track of the area. They said they don't know what stage I am (although the dr did say that his best guess at the moment would be stage 2) and I now need to wait for a CT scan to see if it's spread elsewhere so it can be staged. I've been told if it's spread then it will no longer be curable but that any treatment I receive will just be to prolong my life . If it hasn't spread though and is a lower stage then the chemo should work. Prior to diagnosis, I felt absolutely fine (apart from the small pain in my breast) but now I feel constantly sick, am unable to eat at all and just don't know how I'm going to get through to the CT scan (a week today with the possibility of the results at my first oncology appointment on Wednesday 16th August). Every ache I feel I convince myself it's spread and every sick feeling (so ALL the time) I convince myself it's spread. I want to get to the CT results (but only if they're good - if they're bad then I don't want them!) so I can start chemo (they said in approx 3-4 weeks). I hate walking around with this hideous cancer in me. I want to rip it off my chest. The fear that I am just wandering around getting on with daily stuff and it is there silently growing and spreading is freaking me out. We sat our 3 kids down on Thursday night and told them. They are 13, 8 and 16 months (obviously the 16 month old is oblivious). My biggest fear is that I won't get to see my kids grow up and that they will be left without a mum at such young ages. I am also fearful that they will witness me getting more and more ill which is something I don't think anyone should have to see - I was with my mum at the end of her cancer battle only a few months ago and it was heartbreaking). The letter to my dr informing them I have cancer came through yesterday and on reading it is says I have a 'number of involved lymph nodes' and the pathology report (I stupidly asked for a copy of) says 'multiple lymph node involvement'... I am so scared this means it has spread elsewhere in my body. I have a CT scan booked for next weekend which will answer that question but I am going out of my mind as I have absolutely convinced myself it's spread. I only found the lump once I was getting an achy, bruised feeling in my armpit (it's what made me have a feel around) so it was obviously the lymph node involvement that I was feeling. I keep thinking if I'd checked my breasts sooner then I may have found the lump sooner etc etc I have been on here and other places looking for the one story like mine that I can cling to but nobody seems to have grade 3 with lymph node involvement etc. I can't convey how absolutely scared to my very core I am. I am barely functioning and just trying to get through the day until I can take a sleeping tablet at night to knock me out. And even that doesn't allow much sleep and I woke up yesterday in a pool of sweat (of course I've convinced myself that is another symptom of it having spread). I don't know where to turn and am desperately trying to hold it together for my kids. I know there is nothing anyone can say to stop my fears but if there are any ideas how to eleviate this constant sick feeling and how to get through until treatment, they would be most appreciated. And any positive stories of people who have been in my position would also be welcomed with open arms. Thank you for reading (if you got this far!) Nikki xxx",

      "Content": "Thank you so much for taking the time to reply.  Congratulations on doing so well after your cancer diagnosis. I have (thankfully) heard many positive stories about wonderful ladies bravely overcoming breast cancer and although that fills me with hope, my absolute fear is that mine has spread (if it's already in 'multiple lymph nodes' then it seems a likely outcome to me). I *think* they pretty much told me that if it has spread they can't 'cure' me, only prolong my life a little. That is what is taking over my every waking moment and I am finding it hard to function on even the very basic level. I just can't leave my kids. I flit between absolute certainty that I will do WHATEVER it takes to beat this so I can be here, to utter dread that that decision may be taken out of my hands. I am in utter limbo until the CT scan but the reality after those results *could* actually be a million times worse than it already it (at least at the moment I can occasionally allow my mind to wander to the possibility it hasn't spread further than my lymph nodes) I need someone with a crystal ball to tell me 'this is all going to be ok' and then I will put my big girl pants on and fight, fight, fight!",

I will take a cyber hug   I'm trying to distract and yesterday ended up not being too bad and today I have been fairly well distracted too. I am watching CBB - although I'm not really 'watching it'!! I started breaking bad a while ago but never got round to continuing with it... maybe I should?! The lymph nodes thing - as far as I am aware they only took a biopsy from one of my lymph nodes and that showed cancerous cells and the report says 'multiple involved lymph nodes' so they must've seen others on the ultrasound?!  I am dreading the CT scan but if it is good news (as in there are no cancerous cells anywhere else other than my breast and lymph nodes), then I am eager for it to happen and to get to the next stage of things (the chemo I believe). I'm trying to remain positive - it's just not in my nature... I've always been a glass half empty kinda girl and always err on the pessimistic side (I wish I were different as it can be hard living like that at times). I have plenty of positive people around me that are taking up the slack for me! Thanks again, I really appreciate every reply. Nikki xxx P.s.

I want to be as positive as I can and to not waste my time and energy being scared and sad and angry and all those other emotions but I just can't seem to get there at the moment. I've just spent a couple of hours with a good friend who I haven't seen since I've been diagnosed (she knew as we've been in contact but this was the first time I'd actually seen her)... I didn't want to go as I didn't know how I would feel (either talking about it or talking about anything but 'it'), but it was just what I needed and I didn't feel sick the whole time I was there, didn't feel the need for the loo and I actually felt hungry for the first time in days (all the things that have been troubling me since last weeks' diagnosis). I'm hoping that means that a lot of these worrying 'symptoms' are more anxiety/stress related than my fear that they are because my cancer has spread. My right arm still has that heavy, cold, achy feeling that it's had since my biopsy (but I'm hoping that could just be down to the position of the biopsy in relation to a nerve there - possible or not, I don't know!) We talked over many of my worries - the wording on my pathology report from my biopsy, what 'fast growing' (aka grade 3) cells actually means, what makes something treatable as opposed to not, how to get through panic attacks and learn to accept the situation. I came away feeling much calmer and less anxious about everything. I only hope this feeling will last a bit and not disappear too soon as it's still a whole week until my CT scan!!  I am so grateful to each of you for taking the time to reply to me - it is great to see such an fantastically supportive group.
