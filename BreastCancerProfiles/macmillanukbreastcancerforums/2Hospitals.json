    "Content": "Hello!  I have had five months of wrangling over the phased return.   (I had surgery last June and radiotherapy ending last September, followed by hormone therapy for 5 years.)  In spite of advice from my GP, my employers have expected a linear progress towards full-time hours, which I could not achieve due to fatigue.  At the beginning of February I submitted a formal flexible working request to share my job with a colleague who also wanted to reduce his hours, but they turned us down.  I have now been redeployed to another job which is a half-time post.  I had to accept it on the basis of a completely new contract, so there is no possibility of returning to my old full-time hours (and income) if my energy and capability levels should improve.  My employers have requested three written Occupational Health reports, plus a written report from my GP.  The emotional effect of this process has been devastating.  It feels very lonely, and you start to wonder if you really are making it all up!  I have had no time or energy to reflect on the cancer, only on the problem of how I have been failing to do my job properly because I didn't have enough energy.  On Macmillan advice I provided my employer with a work and cancer kit.   I hope your GP will be as good as mine has been. Little Susan",
