      "Content": "Hello I am new to the forum and interested to know if anyone else gets recurring cording after their surgery.  Mine doesn\u2019t seem to go away unless I stretch and move everyday.  I don\u2019t mind this too much except my latest in my belly makes me feel sick, and it\u2019s just a little one.  I am having some fun inventing movements to see if I can heal it...... ",

      "Content": "Hello No! Not a wimp at all.  Let\u2019s see. Mmmmn life threatening disease, major operation, toxic therapies some still ongoing.  In my experience it is a hell of a lot for mind and body to digest and recover from.  My cancer experience started a year ago and I am definitely not right yet, and it is just a few months after radio and chemo.  Still on herceptin and tamoxifen.  It\u2019s all yuck but I am glad to be alive. I couldn\u2019t cope with the FEC-T, I just did seven weeks of taxol before I stopped with neuropathy.  How is that for being a wimp!?  I asked myself the wimp question then. It sounds like you are doing very well.  We are all so different.  Your friend wants you to be well but hasn\u2019t a clue.  Why should she. Pip x",
