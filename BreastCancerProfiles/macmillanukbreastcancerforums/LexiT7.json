      "Content": "Hey B3cky and welcome! Although I'm sorry you find yourself here because of having chemotherapy.  I'm so glad though that you have a clear plan of action to fight this, I think it makes it a little easier when you know what's happening and what's going to be done to get rid of the cancer. You're doing amazingly well, especially with how hard your treatment regime sounds! And you'll have to let us know how you get on at your wig appointment, it may be helpful for some of the other ladies to find out what happens during the appointment and the choices of wigs you have, and of course, let us know what lovely style you have.  Good luck for your next Chemotherapy, but we are always here, and I hope you do find this thread helpful, it's very helpful for questions and any concerns you want to ask about, and as you said its lovely to actually speak to people who truly understand it, as not many people actually do. I'm glad you've found us, and found this thread, as you could probably help people too, a lot more than you May realise.  Lots of love, hugs and strength to you!  Alex xxxx",

I've had a look through the Macmillan website and if you go on This Link you will find out more accurate information about DCIS. I know what you mean about things being important at 4am in the morning, I think that's when our brains decide to pick up on everything! Well done though for getting through your mastectomy just yesterday-youre a true hero. I hope your recovery goes well, and your pain isn't too bad after such a big operation. You're a star.  Lots of love, and let us know how you get on,  Alex xxxx",

      "Content": "Hey MamaSm I am one of the newer champs on Macmillan, and Its nice to meet you- except for the circumstances we have met for.  Firstly I want to say how sorry I am for the fact a tumour has been found on one of your ribs, after doing the amazing job of getting through breast cancer 5 years ago. I cant even begin to imagine how you're feeling right now, but ive had a look on Macmillan for some information for you. This is a link for secondary bone cancer and information regarding it which you may find helpful to read through. Also, This link is to the information regarding the emotional side of this, as being diagnosed for a second time, is enough to do more than put your head in a whirl.  Just remember how strong you have already been, and that you've already got through the massive hurdle of overcoming cancer once, and although you didnt ever want to do it again, you know you have what it takes to kick cancer out.  I wish you the best of luck, do continue to let us know how you get on with everything, and remember, us here at Macmillan, like the lovely people who have already replied to you, are always here for you, for whenever you want to chat, want support or even just want to vent! We will be here to listen.  Lots of love and light to you, and good luck with your oncologist appointment,  Alex xxx",

      "Content": "Hello to all of you lovely people, and welcome to June's Radiotherapy Chat. Where are the months going! This is a place where you can offer support , ask for advice, receive support and just query anything involving radiotherapy. A couple of quick tips, if you're driving to your radiotherapy appointments each day, or any time, ask if your hospital offers free parking for people going through treatment, or if they have a voucher for a discount off parking fees, which a lot of hospitals do offer. Also, try to keep the area moisturised with a fragrance free lotion, to help with soreness.  For more tips, heres our Radiotherapy Tips Page and I'm sure you all have some of your own tips to share, and ones that people post that you will find useful.  Heres also A link from the Macmillan Information pages, which also includes a helpful video that some of you may want to have a look at.  This is the link to the June radiotherapy chat for those of you who would like to see how the thread works, or to just have a look back at last months chat and see what you can find out from others. It will be locked shortly from replies, but you can still take a look.  Whatever reason you find yourselves here, just remember you're all so strong, amazing and simply the bravest. You've got me again this month! And we are always here for you. You'll always have your Macmillan family here for you, which includes other members who have helped you and been there for you.  Lots of love, hugs, light and healing to each and every one of you,  Alex xxxx",
