I'm trying to find a way to deal with it, and to be able to face my children (ages 22, 19, 17, 16) without breaking down. Any advice??",

It's comforting to know that I'm not the only one who doesn't know how to feel, and when I'm asked am I ok, I just say yes I am. Not really knowing what to say. Thank you so much for your advise. I will keep reading this for reassurance . Sending some love back xx",
