      "Content": "Hi, i have recently had a hysteroscopy to check for cysts and a thickened  womb lining or god forbid womb cancer  (waiting for results) have only been on tamoxifen for 12 months.  My gyno and breast cancer oncologist will then decide wether to insert the coil (which i had removed because my cancer was ER positive so seems bizarre) wether i remain on tamoxifen , have a hysterectomy (hope not ) or something else. They seemed confident it is the tamoxifen causing the issues x ",

      "Content": "Could it be scar tissue pootlecav?  The same thing has happened to me although I have had my radiotherapy. Had first surgery 14th Feb, no clear margins so 2nd surgery 22nd Feb and 20 radiotherapy sessions finished 2 weeks ago.  Last week a big lump appeared on my original tumour site. It's really quite big. Went into see the BCN and she checked and so did the on call doctor and they think it's scar tissue. No scans or anything so I do hope they are right!!!!!  Let us know how you get on x ",

      "Content": "Hi all Its been a while since I have posted. Had my 12 month post diagnosis mammogram in Feb this year, all clear (yipee) and have now been on Tamoxifen for about 12 months.  My periods completely stopped (to be fair I had the coil previous to that so they were no existent anyway) but a few months ago I had a (very light) period and some spotting, which was a shock and an internal scan showed a thickening of the womb lining so I was sent for a hyterscopy as they feared womb cancer. Results were thankfully all clear but now a few weeks later I'm bleeding again. (very light) so my question is, Does anyone still have periods while on Tamoxifen? I had some blood tests to suggest I'm still pre menopausal (Im 46) but how will I know when I'm post menopausal if I have no periods anyway? So confused. Have an appointment with my oncologist next month but was hoping someone might be able to shed some light in the mean time.  xxx",

      "Content": "Hi all, have been taking tamoxifen for about 5 weeks (no chemo prior to that) but my hand and foot joints are cracking and clicking and very stiff. Not too painful at the moment but a bit worrying. Can anyone recommend any vitamins or supplements that might help which is safe to take with tamoxifen. I'm a very active horse rider and need my hands to work!  Will ask my oncologist when i see him but that might be a while.  Thanks x ",

      "Content": "teresapolo Hi there - sorry cannot answer your question but I am a very active horse rider and I'm just getting over a mastectomy and got back in the saddle after 4 weeks. I'm seeing my oncologist on Thursday to find out about my treatment.  I know I'm having radiotherapy and tamoxifen but finding out about chemo then which I am dreading.  Are you managing to ride with how you are now? Did you have radiotherapy and how did that affect your riding? Sorry to ask when you need answers yourself but do not know of any riders that have gone through this.  I hope your symptoms have not got any worse and would appreciate any tips you have on coping with the treatment while trying to look after horses. Best wishes Teresa x hi teresa i had two operations for a lumpectomy , 2nd one because there was no clear margin. No Chemo thank goodness And managed to get back in the saddle after 2 weeks. i have had 20 sessions of radiotherapy actually the last one is on Monday! I have ridden all the waY through. Actually more than before as I'm off work. X country, show jumping , the lot. Yes i have been tired and my boob is red and itchy but if it wasn't for my horses i would have spent most the time sitting on the sofa. They have kept my sane and active and the treatment has not stopped my doing anything.  Hope that helps xx ",

Still have bone pain and the occasional hot flush but try and call it my tamoxifriend as it\u2019s hopefully doing its job. X ",
