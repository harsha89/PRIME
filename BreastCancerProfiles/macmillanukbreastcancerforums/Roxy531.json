    "Content": "I had a bilateral mx and wasn't told until histology came back that I had a second which I'm sure would have been evident during the operation. I think they might take the view that until pathology has been tested etc there is no point telling us about what the second lump 'might' be and in all honesty I'd rather hear facts when they are confirmed than maybes. If you want to chat about mastectomy feel free to add and PM me xx",
