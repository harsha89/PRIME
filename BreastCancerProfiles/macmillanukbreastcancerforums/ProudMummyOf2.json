      "Content": "Well tomorrow is the day I go to have my first appointment in the breast clinic! I am so nervous and scared right now.  I know the chances of a lump being cancer is low, but that coupled with dimpling of the skin makes it more likely (I know, I probably shouldn't have read too much but nothing else I could do on this longest week wait of my life!)  To make things even better, I now have to go and work a 13 hour night shift before going straight to my 2-3 hour appointment!  Honestly, I could just cry. Hubby at home with our youngest daughter so I'm on my own tomorrow.  Not quite sure what I'm after at the moment but just feel like I needed to get all of this off my chest. Putting on a brave face but it's killing me. Even been doing self breast exams every day this week hoping I (and my GP) were wrong and there was nothing there but I am sadly disappointed every time. ",

      "Content": "Thank you to everyone for all of your lovely comments.  I met the consultant who was lovely who saw the dimpling but thought everything felt OK. She didn't do a mammogram due to my age? She sent me for an ultrasound of the suspect area. Thankfully the scan came back clear! Biggest relief of my life. She thinks the dimpling might be down to weight loss and is nothing to worry about! I can finally breathe.  Again, thank you to everyone for all of the support and I hope that everyone's journey goes as smoothly as possible xx ",
