      "Content": "Hi I had one new year eve 2001 with no reconstruction and it was not as bad as i thought. mine was completly removed including part of chest wall, nipple etc. 2 hours after surgery i was sat up in bed eating lunch. I was in hospital for 5 days until the drains came out ( worse part that as u have to take them with you wherever u go but not painful just a nuisance ) Physio arrives next day to help with any movement and give u exercises to do and this is best done to help recovery. i took the six weeks off work to recover but was still doing plenty while at home. Tiredness is probably worst from the anaesthetic. Some do not stay in hospital long depends on where u are etc, i could have come home next day but hubby was squeamish with the drains so i stayed in. Always ask staff if unsure of anything as they are usually very helpful and kind. Wishing you well and hope all goes ok as the unknown is always scary but you will be ok. ((((hug)))) Rose",

      "Content": "Hi I can sympathise with you as it is the chemotherapy that makes you so weak but once it has finished you should be able to get strength back etc and hopefully you will not have any more secondaries to delay. It is worth finishing the course even though you do not feel so good and it is stressful but think ahead and take your doctor advice about what is recommended. It is possible to go into remission as i dont know what chemo you are on - I took Taxotare for when it was said no hope after having secondary cancers but it did knock the cancer back into remission even though it has now returned. I wish you all the best and good luck. Rose",
