We had a holiday booked to florida for my 50th Birthday celebration s instead the holiday had to be cancelled and I was having a pick-line fitted on the actual day for chemo the following day.  You will worry at every stage but you will get through. All the best Karen ",

      "Content": "Hi Gem I was diagnosed in Jan 2015 with invasive DCIS with lymp nodes involved and was really scared at the time but like everyone on here is saying this is a great site with personal experiences that help us along the way.  I had a mastectomy with  expander then chemo and radiotherapy am now taking Tamoxifen.  My expander will be replaced in November with an implant. The waiting for results and appointments was really hard but once your team looking after you have them a plan of treament is then discussed and I felt much better and thought iv got do whatever I have to.  Im feeling really good and have overcome my fear of hospitals now.  Hope you get your treatment plan soon and keep us updated. Take care Karen",

I also have found the brand TEVA has suited me much better so keep a check on what is best for you.  I no longer have the knee/joint pain and the hot flushes are less frequent. Hair is still short but now growing a lot thicker rather than longer but I actually like it my chemo finished September 2015. Good luck with the tamoxifen it has to be worth trying. Take care Karen",

All the best for next week ",
