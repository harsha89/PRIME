      "Content": "Hello Pauletta and Loubag Thank you for the feedback on your experiences. I heard about the 2 day fasting, I think my only worry is that I weigh 38 kg ( I am petite) and the fast will bring my weight down very quickly. Worth considering though as the fasting is meant to enhance the chemo attacking the cancer cells. I have a wig ( nhs voucher)but I was interested in the fringe wig and hat, where did you purchase the fringe wig from please? Like you Loubag, I am trying to stay positive, its hard work though because the fear/anxiety can take over ! Thank you for your kind wishes I hope your next treatments will also be kind to you hugs Suzie",

Whereas, it sounds like it was the correct decision as 15 had cancer cells, the side effects don't sound very pleasant ! Hindsight is a great thing, but knowing where you are now...would you have made the same decision or perhaps requested less nodes removed ? Did you have level 1 to 3 removed? And had the cancer spread to your lymph nodes on diagnosis? I do hope you find a solution to your  symptoms and they are alleviated Suzie xx",

I read your post with interest because I was speaking  to  my surgeon about not having a full axillary clearance, so I am keen about hearing of this targeted procedure. You mentioned nothing to be removed of the original tumour, so how much of the original did they remove when you had the lumpectomy, in terms of size? Could you please mention who the surgeon was and which hospital? They sound very up with the latest techniques? Hope your seroma gets sorted out and speedy recovery Suzie",

I went to see a surgeon privately hoping that he may agree to removing only the sentinal but he felt it would be unethical for him to do so. I understand his position but I am still seeking a surgeon who has a different approach like your surgeon with a new school of thought. My question is, would your surgeon actually follow through if after the adjuvant chemo, they clear? I would be immensely grateful if you could you please share what the new adjuvant chemo is and the name of the surgeon/ hospital. ",

I don't want a clearance and have only one node which showed up as having microscopic cancer in a biopsy, but the surgeon insists on a clearance. I am looking for a surgeon who may be willing to offer me the choice of not having a clearance and don't mind travelling .Could you share which hospital you are at and the name of surgeon, if possible please?
