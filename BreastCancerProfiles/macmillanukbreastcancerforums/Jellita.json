      "Content": "Hi Deb, no I didn't use the cold cap my hair started to fall out two weeks after my first chemo. It's now two and a half weeks later and my hair is very thin but seems to have slowed down a bit. I have invested in a few scarves and hats to keep my head warm and have a prescription wig ready for when it's all gone. You might want to ask about a PICC line if your veins are not great. I had one inserted between the first &second chemo and it made it a lot easier to take bloods and administer the chemo. Happy to chat about anything if it will help x.",

I've just had my second chemo session of 6, having had left lumpectomy and full node removal in October. I have found the threads very useful in particular for side effects of the drugs they give you with the chemo. Good luck with yours and keep up the positive attitude, that will get you through the difficult bits. XxX",
