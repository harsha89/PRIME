      "Content": "I had my last chemo on 5th December and although J should be delighted it felt like a bit of an anticlimax.  But now the side-effects are started to ease (a bit) and knowing I haven't got to go through it all again in a couple of weeks I'm feeling happier. As lots of people say, it IS doable.  Drinking more  and sleeping when I need to have been the most helpful things I think. Happy Christmas to everyone!",

There are 3 consultant oncologists in the breast team at my hospital and they are all excellent.  I saw a registrar for my second check-up during chemo and she was useless.  I felt really rushed, she didn't answer any of my questions and it felt like a waste of time. I then saw the consultant next time and she was really helpful, listened to me and as well as leaving with 2 prescriptions she offered to see me again if I was struggling (with the hot flushes mainly). Hope your next appointment is a much better experience x Ann",
