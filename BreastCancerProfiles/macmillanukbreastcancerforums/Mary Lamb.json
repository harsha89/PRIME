    "Content": "It is extremely difficult to get your head round - I found out the hard way, and if I'd been told before screening I would have known it isn't a good option.Yes of course it's up to each individual, and yes of course everyone must have the correct information freely available to make the decision that is right for them. What's right for one isn't always right for another. But in breast cancer screening I think if women knew the facts, knew the odds, I can't see any of them choosing screening. I'll try and say why, and try and keep it short (some hope). I will bother to say it just because the evidence is that only harm results, and I want to protect people from that. From what I went through. I honestly don\u2019t believe that there can be women out there who both understand what the risk of harm is, and what the chance of benefit, and still want screening. If I thought people could get this info from the NHS, where they should, I wouldn\u2019t bother. Right now, you meet a woman who got diagnosed at screening, and she thinks her life was saved by screening. I did. But now I know that is very unlikely to be true. The Marmot review, and it\u2019s not the last word, showed 4000 women a year get treatment they don't need because they are not in danger. That\u2019s bad. But 1300 women a year don't die of breast cancer as a result of screening. That looks like a small success. Unfortunately it isn't. Not dying of breast cancer doesn't mean not dying. There is no evidence that anyone lives longer as a result of screening. Marmot doesn\u2019t claim there is; it just doesn\u2019t agree with the Nordic Cochrane Centre about the interpretation of this result. That\u2019s fine, let the experts thrash it out. Meantime \u2013 women need to know there is disagreement which has consequences for the claim that even 1300 women benefit from screening. What is clear from the Nordic Cochrane Centre assessments of all the same evidence and more is that, comparing populations with screening and without, you get the same number of deaths overall, but 1300 fewer breast cancer deaths (although that is an overestimate, according to the NC Centre, who issued their first systematic review in 2000). The 1300 still die, but not of breast cancer. They die of complications and longer term effects of treatments. They don't die of breast cancer, but there isn't any evidence that they live longer. We might hope they do, we may surmise that some do, we may wish it. But there isn't evidence. But there are 16,600 screening diagnoses a year. What happens to the other 11,300? These get no change in outlook from screening. Most are successfully treated, but would have been anyway. A minority still die from their breast cancer, as they would have done anyway. Breast screening was never expected to help the majority of diagnosed women, and it never has. It was hoped it would help a few but there is no evidence it does. As always expected, most women have the same outcome they would have had if they hadn\u2019t found their cancer earlier. This is because screening predominantly detects slow-growing cancers with a good outlook \u2013 the ones that will wait for the next screening. The cancers that crop up between screenings are typically more aggressive, that\u2019s why they don\u2019t wait for the next screening. This makes it look like screening is making women survive longer; but it isn\u2019t. The survival is measured from time of detection, but most women don\u2019t live longer than they would have done. Women diagnosed with cancer weren\u2019t necessarily going to die the same year. The 1300 die several years later too, only not of breast cancer but of heart, or lung damage due to radiotherapy or chemotherapy, or other late effects of treatments. The screening people keep repeating: \"We don't know which ones will progress so we treat them all\". Some people think: that's right, you could hardly leave it. Better safe than sorry. Sure, but screening isn't sold to women on the basis that they'll have to decide on precautionary treatment that may be unnecessary. It's sold to them on the basis that if they get diagnosed with cancer then they've got cancer and need treatment. And that isn\u2019t true. Because they don\u2019t know which ones will progress, and which ones won\u2019t. They don\u2019t know before they treat, and they don\u2019t know after. No woman diagnosed at screening knows whether she\u2019s about to have life-saving treatment, as most women believe is the case, or whether she\u2019s about to have needless treatment for a cancer that is not progressive, or whether she\u2019s about to have earlier treatment for a real but slow-growing cancer without any benefit from it being earlier. So no woman diagnosed at screening knows which group she\u2019s in: one of the 1300, who get a change in cause of death; or one of the 11,300; or one of the 4000. I don\u2019t know which I am. I may still die from my breast cancer \u2013 if I had breast cancer; or my treatment may have been successful, even if unduly early; or not; or I may have had totally unnecessary treatment, leaving me at risk of the longer term effects which kill some people. I can\u2019t know. Could someone tell me in what way I\u2019ve benefitted from screening? I\u2019m not an exception, I\u2019m the rule; everyone in the same boat. Surely the NHS wouldn\u2019t do that. That's what I thought. Look at the evidence. Look at the Nordic Cochrane Centre website. So why is it that women diagnosed at screening leave their doctors thinking \"Screening saved my life\" when that is so unlikely? I can only guess, and my guess is this: doctors receive women from the screening service with a diagnosis. As far as their concerned it's their job to treat people with diagnoses to save their life, end of. They know all this, but they want to keep it simple, and they like to think they're helping people. So they just don\u2019t mention that the chance that earlier treatment has helped is very small, and it wouldn't be pleasant at this stage to mention that there is a significant chance it isn\u2019t needed. So they don't. That's hard to take. Don't think I don't know that.",
