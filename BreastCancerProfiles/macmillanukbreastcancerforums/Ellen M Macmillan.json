    "Content": "Hi Bustysusy, My name is Ellen and I\u2019m the Online Digital Nurse working at Macmillan. I work alongside the Online Community Team. Part of my role is to answer questions about cancer on our Ask a Nurse section. It\u2019s great to read that you\u2019ve been lucky enough to have been offered various therapies and massages. But I hope you don\u2019t mind that  our CommunityTeam have asked if I would be able to clarify the conflicting information that you read in yesterday\u2019s Daily Mail article about spas turning away cancer patients. We agree that it does appear to give conflicting information. We can understand why you have questioned what Dany our specialist advisor for treatment at Macmillan has reported to have said. So, thank you for bringing the article to our attention. We appreciate that it\u2019s difficult enough knowing what to do for the best without feeling confused. I\u2019ve contacted Dany and she has had a look at the article and agrees is misleading in the way that it has been written. However, the only bit that applies to her are the ones in the speech marks below. As Dany Bell, a specialist adviser for treatment and recovery at Macmillan Cancer Support, explains: \u2018Although there is no evidence to suggest that spa treatments are harmful, therapists working with cancer patients should be trained with some knowledge of cancer.\u2019 The comment below is not in speech marks and is not something that she would say. She is not sure where they got this from. That\u2019s because chemotherapy and radiotherapy can make the skin more sensitive, and in breast cancer patients who have had lymph glands removed, pressure in those areas can increase the risk of lymphoedema \u2014 swelling due to a malfunction of the lymphatic system. Dany has added that what she did say was: \u201cWe generally support the benefit this brings to people alongside traditional treatment and acknowledge the relaxing effect it may have. It would be helpful if Spa\u2019s delivering treatment regularly to cancer patients had some insight and that therapists are generally keen to do this\u201d We have this information about massage that can be helpful to read. As well as this search engine that can help someone find what services are available where they live. Cheryl our Macmillan Lymphoedema Specialist, answers questions about Lymphoedema on our Online Community. She\u2019s on holiday just now but back next week if there is anything that you wanted to ask about her lymphoedema and massage. Best wishes and take care. Ellen-Macmillan Online Digital Nurse Specialist.    ",
