    "Content": "Hi my name is Lita, in 2003 I was diagnosed with Pagets of the breast, grade 3 IDC and intermediate grade DCIS, thankfully with a lot of very agressive chemo and a lot of support from my family I am in my 5th year of remission. My question is, has anyone here had reconstruction using skin expander? I am also down for a reduction on my right side, (I am a 42 G at the moment) I am so looking forward to this but really nervous at the same time and just wanted to know of someone else been through the same or similar Thanks and Regards Lita",
