    "Content": "Hi, I was wondering if anyone can help. I was diagnosed with BC yesterday, I am having a full body CT scan today and an MRI tomorrow. My Consultant has told me I need a mastectomy on my right breast and wants to do it quickly. I am going to be tested for the BRCA gene which I am aware of it is positive then I will need a mastectomy on the left side too. He has said the results will take 4 weeks... is there anywhere I can get tested quickly?? I am 35 on my own with 2 kids and would far rather have just 1 operation. Any help would be massively appreciated.",
