    "Content": "Hi, I finished four weeks ago and also experienced blistering,skin peeling and weeping about a week after. I put up with it but it became so sore that I phoned the radiotherapy department and was prescribed what I can only describe as a miracle cream, Flamazine (silver sulfadiazine) and low tack gel like dressings. After the first application started to feel better and has healed very quickly with subsequent applications.Â ",
