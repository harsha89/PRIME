      "Content": "Hello Dorothy thank you for your reply . Two weeks ago she told me the doctors said she only had months left . That her liver had got worse . I guess I feel panicky I don't understand what months means?  I understand what yr saying about the independence  . I won't ever try to take that away from her . She tells me she's confused about moving.  She tells me she's scared and wants to be near her family and feels it all a nightmare .  Then there's her boyfriend  who I feel is in deniel with what is happening to her  he has told her he will not move with her so this is hurting her feelings to.  She's in a catch 22 as the saying goes.  I am close to her family but I feel I can't break her confidence and tell them how she's feeling because of her boyfriend she's been stalling the move because of him .  But at the same time tells me she's scared and wants to be near her family . I don't no what to do for the best.  Iv liase with council and local mps to assist her . Ball rolling but slowly . But it's her partner saying he won't come live with her down here that is confusing her . I'm sorry this is so long.  I'm worried abt her . And this month's thing has confused me to.  I want to support her the best I can ",

      "Content": "Hello . I'm new here . I'm looking for advice to help my friend . She's been told she only has months to live. I'm trying to get my best friend transferred from Luton to Bexhill. She's been bidding on home move. She wants to be near her family when she dies . The council medical examiner has said that her accommodation in Luton is suitable for her needs. But the issue is she needs to be near her family when she dies not up in Luton she tells me she's scared and I'm becoming increasingly worried abt her being up Luton . She's only 48 . Iv written letters to the council and I feel there response to a dieing lady is disgusting . I need advice as I don't know what else to do. I travel to Luton as much as I can. I'm just worried I'm letting her down I feel so desperate and angry . Plz help michelle",

She is a very independent woman and has told me she would feel a burden on her family and wants her own hme even though she only has months left . Iv even tried to get her to move in with me but she says she will burden no one. Even though I have assured her that she won't be. Council says she's in band a priority but then they write her this stupid letter. I'm feeling very angry and don't no were to direct it. My friend care. Has been hit and miss since her cancer was diagnosed. And she still been treated badly . . Thank you though for taken the time to reply x",
