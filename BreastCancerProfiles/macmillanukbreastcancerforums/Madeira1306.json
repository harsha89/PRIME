      "Content": "I saw my surgeon yesterday .....he is foreign but to be fair I've been impressed so far.....I think sometimes when there's so much info to take in it doesn't matter who is delivering the news but good you had friends with you...I took my partner and friend last week mainly for friend to take notes in case we missed something in the emotional haze.... I'm same as you had option of lumpectomy or mastectomy...a stage 2 lump with no indication of cells in nodes at minute but they are suspicious as swollen so having sentinel biopsy as well as lumpectomy on 28th...it's early days for us both and I fear my nodes are involved just biopsy hasn't proven it yet.....stay strong and take any help from your friends ...keep busy until then and stay strong....",
