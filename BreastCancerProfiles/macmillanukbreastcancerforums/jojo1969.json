      "Content": "Hi there, 'm 47 and started my chemo om May 11th, FEC for 3 sessions then FEC-T for last 3, with surgery to follow, then 3 weeks of radio. Please believe me when I say its not as bad as you could imagine, any side effects you may have are catered for with all sorts of meds to counter act them, the first 3 days when  I was  on steroids and anti sickness I felt absolutely fine, just keep on top of them, the come down off the steroids made me feel a bit weary and teary for just a couple of days then by day 7 I was visiting friends in London having a merry old time, I had my second session less than 48 hours ago and I've just come back from a weekend in Liverpool. I too am trying the Paxman cooling system, again after reading reports of how uncomfortable it was I find it perfectly doable, yes the first 5-10 mins are a bit uncomfortable and bit like brain freeze from an ice cream but then it all goes numb and apart from the chin strap to hold it in place I forget its there. Make sure you drink plenty of fluids before your appointment to get the veins nice and plump and keep your hands warm to open the veins  up as you have the cap on half an hour before the treatment starts, the duration of the treatment , then one and half hours after, I have found my hair is thinning a little but not as anyone else can tell, I too have a wig consultation on the cards just in case. My worst side effect is the hot flushes, which keeps most of the family highly amused, when I start rushing about to get outside. You'll find your own way of coping and please believe me when I say I am the biggest stress head in the world, but this is not half as bad as I expected. try and stay positive and listen to your body. Good luck Love and hugs Jojo x",

Only 5  days later I am literally taking each hour as it comes, I tried to work on Saturday but only lasted 4 hours, it was far too much, luckily I have an amazing employer who supports me 110%, take all your meds and listen to your body is the best advice I can give.  Good luck to you x ",

I do still however have some small pockets of fluid and there is still some swelling which I am quite conscious of.  On the whole everything went really well  If you need anymore info just shout  xxx",

      "Content": "Hi lovely, I'm on a different regime, just had 2nd  FEC-T, I found whilst I was on the initial  3 day steroids I was absolutely fine,  days 4-7 were particularly rough, especially Day 4. but gradually during day 7 I could feel the 'normal' me returning, today is day 9 and I've been out all day with my son. Make notes of how you feel, symptoms etc, to take to you oncology appointments, there may be something they can do to help you, as everyone reacts differently and even the experts can't predict how your body will react before you get your first chemo. I find sitting outside in the fresh air with a good book (I treated myself to a new Kindle) even if you have to wrap up, helps a great deal. And talk about how you are feeling, don't bottle it up! Scream if you have to but get it out. I have found great comfort from  the kind ladies on here who have taken their time to advise me, so keep talking and asking, you'll get there, I promise. Sending you a massive hug and remember tomorrow is another day closer to beating this. lots of love Jo x I have found great comfort from all of the kind ladies on here who have given me their own pearls of wisdom.",
