    "Content": "Hi Peanut57, hop you don\u2019t mind me asking but how long did you wait to have your Oncotype DX results?  I had mastectomy and reconstruction on the 6th October.  My turnouts were sent on the 20th.  I\u2019m just going out of my mind, it just feels like I got a big black cloud over my head.  I\u2019m remaining positive though. Big cwtches lovely, hope you heal soon. Jan xx",
