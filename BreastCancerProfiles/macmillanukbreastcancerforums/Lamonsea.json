      "Content": "Thank you to all of you. I do understand what you're saying but I don't have anyone to help. I have aspergers and possibly adhd and I have only one friend who currently has a very ill mother. My partner is not my children's father, he is absent, and my children are quite mean to my partner and won't let him do things much at all unless it's fixing something broken or dealing with spiders. He's very practical like that but hopeless round the house or cooking etc. He finds it very hard with both my daughters and started having s go at my younger ne'er one yesterday when SHE missed a bit of HER programme she was watching her way he told her to rewind it and she said she'd seen it and do he started telling her off for lying . It then took half hour of me refereeing to get through to him that actually he had been rude to her. This is just one example. So my partner cannot take over issues with the school. Working the hours he does is quite enough for him and anything else out on him woukd break our family. He comes to my appts but I am the one who has my head in gear on all the school stuff and even clothes buying it can only be me as my daughter also with aspergers and adhd gets angry as cannot cope with embarrassment of anyone else knowing anything. She needs this to work this year at school as the education Sen team believe another school failure will be as for her and as she won't travel in a taxi to school thus local one is her last chance.  I a have researched and the Errors and delays so far mean I am already 4 months post first surgery and hence I have an extra 34% worse chance of survival. Had they given me hormone therapy it would be a different matter. I have also researched and found being er + means I could have the hormone therapy first to stop progression and treatment f I could get that new drug palbociclib too then it could wait till next year easily. This problem Is all down to my totally inadequate care team. They don't even allocate a BCN. I niw have to check everything they are supposed to be doing as clearly they can't get it right or be trusted. I have no choice but to wait as in any case I've only got 5 or so years anyway from what I can see all coincidence easily be in the % and f people who don't survive till 10 years so I'd rather be here now for n ct 5 ferocity bg well and able as few more years and the girls will be older. Have one 13 more like 9, abd one 11 who has already started a year ago acting more like her older sister. I'm sure there must be others who have had to delay. I already missed my elder daughters 9th birthday due to Achilles operation and hospital not telling me in overnight and she not really over that either . With the mistakes, got sll I know they've mixed up samples too ",

      "Content": "I am seriously now certain I need to delay chemo until 2nd week January for reasons below because I believe my body just won't cope because of other stressors in next few months that I usually struggle with even when well and not working. In June 2014 I had odd skin anomaly and they only did mammogram and ultra sound and couldn't find anything. However given the diagnosis now of invasive lobular I know that doesn't show from those tests very often and hence they should have ruled this out by doing mri 3 years s ago and again in march this year. I only know about this fact since I was finally diagnosed July 2017. I was diagnosed march 17 with 4mm dcis which only needed lumpectomy radio and hormone therapy. After op changed to lcis and in may was told found invasive at margin. They again recommended lumpectomy and sentinel node biopsy. Resulted in axillary clearance. Found now it was invasive lobular tumour size now 56mm. Decided on mastectomy as no clear margin. This found another area so now tumour is 66mm and one lymph node affected. Right from first op known er + and still nothing done to slow spread. As I've already been waiting nearly 5 months since first erroneous diagnosis with 3 ops and hence I am now well over the 60 days after surgery that chemo or radio should start given the biology behind it is that cutting into the cancer can set it growing faster hence why chemo comes before radio. Have done lot of research as effectively having already been i one lymph node, I have got cancer being fuelled by oestrogen over the last 5 months still growing with no hormone therapy yet to slow it down. And still the hospital drags its heels. If I had been diagnosed through thorough investigation 3 years ago with skin dimpling anomaly I would have better prognosis now and no lymph involvement. If they had checked their files and done more thorough in march this year with Mri not done they would have realised lobular invasive sooner and I would have had 1 and if chemo needed it would be over by October. I am now likely faced with Chemo from sept right through to Jan. Which I feel my body wont cope with.....I have daughter with aspergers and extreme anxiety trying her 3rd secondary school from sept. It results in high stress levels meetings with senco and teachers to get things right for her to keep her in school. Plus her anxiety means she brings home every infection going and struggles with even a sore throat. Plus I have to sort 2 daughters birthdays and xmas all in space of 3 weeks starting mid December so I get more stressed from November planning it all anyway normally. It looks like any chemo for me will have to wait another 4 months as I believe there us a great risk of seriously being ill if I do chemo starting sept. I feel all the errors have now given me no confidence in the hospital the statistics or diagnosis methods and that I now can't trust recommendations ..I suggested mastectomy at the start.... nor make a decision one way or other as i am convinced I willbe seriously ill and die from chemo if started in September. And it's slready well past time when should have started due to their lack of proper initial diagnosis. To me it seems I could die in next few months from stresses lowimmunity infections from my children and pneumonia if they start chemo now hence why I feel they left me with no choice but to delay.  My only hope is that oncotype test comes back very low. But am still concerned it could be wrong and that hospital will only have sent latest sample. Which has lesscancer in it than 2ndop tissue. I am also concerned that ct scan refers to possible complex adnexal cysts near uterus which they are not even investigating and could be cancerous. I really am feeling like I am just going to die in 3 months  if they start chemo or let my children down this year being unable to support them school refusal likely and fined and prison and losing them altogether because of all the delays the hospital has caused. I feel unable to make a decision. Consent decline or whatever and the BCN says I cannot have radio first nor delay chemo. I am sure chemo next year would still help surely, they have already left it too long anyway, already delay in hormone therapy start. I am now not even sure I can cope with aromatise inhibitors as already suffer with joints.  My mum aged 20 years in the year she had chemo after mastectomy plus the letrozole and has no energy. Low immunity, heart problems and what not in the last 8 years since her chemo. I felt fine and still do with ops and can't see why I should make myself suffer illness now when right now my children still need me",

Just hope they do everything as promised this morning today but this right now I feel much better than yesterday. Hope goes well for your daughter today ",

Thank you for advice I do get what you're saying just my doctor said it will cause more delay to go online a certain no opnion transferring to Bournemouth instead etc do I'm really stuck with no options and no choice be to help and as for social services I've heard too many bad stories to risk that option plus my daughters really would not cope with that at all, they won't even sleep when im in hospital overnight or do sleepovers with friends at all or school trips either. This is total disaster really and after 5 years survival takes dip even with chemo. Also my daughter with anxiety does refuse treatment blood tests teeth X-rays the lot as too anxious and feels sick so she won't come anywhere near me even now doesn't want the thought of me being ill and unable to take her to school as she won't walk there as too anxious",

      "Content": "Hi Lynn and thank you. I do understand all those things and it's patient support services now at my hospital pals is gone. Re oncotype dd i totally understand it which is why I am concerned as results on only one tissue sample could lead me into no chemo when the first op tissue has different diagnosis plus I have 2 possible vomit key adnexal cysts near uterus which could've malignant yet no investigation done. My daughters won't just step up and emotionally are much younger due to aspergers and my job is to helping her succeed at school this time which could be last chance for her to help her for the future so delaying maybe best decision to ensure I don't get serious infection whilst on chemo hospital n worst months for me catching something she gets from school due to her anxiety. Then I won't be around st all even sooner. Re chemo being do able .... I already suffer intense heartburn from any medication generally since take lansoprazole already. I already suffer with back ache and stiffness and now lymphodema too and if I get heartburn any worse all I want is to curl up and die its my Achilles heel.  Family can't help as no one close that's not ill themselves. Struggle to make friends due to my aspergers too. No one gets me and I still believe the new Pfizer drug could be available as my mastectomy margin was not good at all and then care these other areas found on scan that could be mets or another cancer such as ovarian. I have requested they look at my file and notes I am sending at wed mdt meeting this week. 5 months with nothing to stop growth of any cancer in my chest wall or other breast is not acceptable whatsoever. They should have started me on letrozole as soon as realised they had it wrong and that it was taking months to diagnose fully. They knew er + back in early may and have no idea if other breast also has invasive lobular too as again not easily spotted yet I have same skin dimpling I first noticed on the now removed breast. It is more likely it's the same and it could be spreading fuelled by oestrogen that has not been halted! I have picked up a lot of knowledge from my in depth checks since I realised the problems hospital are continuing to cause and overlook.  I am totally certain my body will react badly to chemo, mine is sensitive just like my daughters, common in autism. Not even sure I will cope with hormone therapy yet either 4 months past first cutting into me and no the cancer is not definitely all gone at all ",

I get what you're sayings but you don't know my girls and my friend agrees they not likely to just step up. They try to avoid the whole thing about my cancer and don't want to have to deal with helping or anything. In any case if my diagnosis that bad surely something would have been done sooner.

I certainly don't want to die from aggressive treatment when I'm too stressed with school issues and catching infections, think that's more likely than waiting actually",

Not involved with social workers whatsoever. Just the Sen team in the education team of our county council.  I don't know how to cope at such a busy time the next 3 months will be already anyway it's routine that helps me cope and with that all messed up by chemo it is likely to stress me so much that I'm m more likely to be ill, as I will push myself to still do it all. That could give a worse outcome. Anyway you really Explained  well thank you. I just have to wait for results and after pushing about ct scan results  I've now got gynaecology appt too.

Unfortunately neither me nor the girls have friends that way hence the importance of new school going well to change all that so they wouldn't go overnight anywhere else anyway as both of them cannot settle at night without me around. My 1 good friend Sarah said she can help where she can but she currently nursing her old parents with their health problems. I have my partner of course, not my girls father who had a job which means he not here first thing mornings or after school till later and hopefully s long days means he gets stressed out easily doing more when he gets home and we struggled somewhat few years ago after my Achilles operation because he tried to do too much and had too little patience with me and the girls. Anyhow the f there's s problem think best bet is to employ a carer probably but will have to see what it entails, as the girls will cope better in own home than away.  Will think about what you suggest anyway so thank you.

      "Content": "Hi. I have had the same / similar experience between april and now. Started off a 4mm area of dcis, per biopsy, so lumpecomy in may, 2 weeks later, tiny arra of lcis in margin, so another lumpectomy in june, results invasive lobular, so mx in july, in between had ct scan before mx, and was told 4mm nodule on lung too, but to be checed again by ct in 6.Months. I only just got copy of ct scan report this week myself, only to find that i also have some sort of complex. mixed cysts either side of uterus, which no one told me about, and the ct scan report says a complex adnexal cyst will need to be excluded, and yet no extra tests have been offered to verify what it is so i am now. Ost concerned about my care team and the mdt meetings discussions and whether they have even co sidered qthos couldbe malignant. I do only have 1 node affected out of 24 . I am not at all happy with not being told about the cysts as we asked was there a yht g else picked up. Y the ct scan and was told no in july. perhaps i should write to get hold of all my records and what was recorded at mdt meetings. I am currently wiaitng for results of oncotype dc test,  ut have already decided there is no point me starting any treatment ntil they check out these other issues. How can i make any deciision about chemo if its only based on my breast tissue cancer cells gene activity with no refernce to these unonown cysts. i just wonder how many others at southampton princess anne hospital are having this issue or similar? i currently, having read abot side evfecs of letrozle, dont even think thats a good idea. My mum had had chemo for breast cancer, albeit hers caused by radiotherapy over 20 years ago, her bc was 8 years agi, and she has been on letrozole, and her body is wuite a state now, heart problems, back and neck problems amd stiffness struggling to move at all in mornings.  I need t be here for my children during the next 5 years of their remaining childhood, and fully focussed due to my 13 year old suffering anxiety at school and fefusals and starting yet anohter school. Im almost at the point now where i dont trust antone at hospital to give me any more treatment whatsoever.

Surgeon just seems to think needs time to fully heal now.
