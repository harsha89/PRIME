    "Content": "I was diagnosed last October with the triple negative BC. I was quickly told not to keep taking the pill I\u2019d been on for ages while I was in treatment. I\u2019ve since had a double mastectomy and reconstruction, so there are zero breast cells left.  My question is wether anyone has experience with going back on the pill after getting the all clear, or if not what other forms of contraception people have used? I\u2019m not even 30 yet and definitely not ready for children so don\u2019t want to take the risk.... I\u2019ve askes my BC nurse who keeps forgetting to get an answer from my oncologist, and im close to just ringing my GP for an answer but any help would be appreciated? ",
