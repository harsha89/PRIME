      "Content": "Hi Sarah I, like you was diagnosed last week. I just knew there was something wrong. I had breast cancer 14 years ago but had been clear since. I had a routine mammogram, was called back for more tests and was diagnosed with a new cancer, not the other one come back, in the same breast I had it in before. I've been feeling dizzy, and still do, for a while now and I'm so tired all the time. So there has to be a connection, there really does. I'm hoping this dizziness will go and soon!! From J ",

      "Content": "Hi JackiRuss Oh it's so nice to hear from you and know we're not alone in our suffering. No one can describe the pain can they? I still can't sleep on that side. How is your pain now? I feel like I've been kicked by a horse on my back that's the only way I can describe it. And I've had fluid drained from my back. Do you work? I'm a self employed hairdresser and it's going to take me ages to get back to it especially moving my arm. My wound on the boob is still leaking to. I feel a right mess!! I bet if they'd said what the pain was like no one would have it done!!  Love jwoowoo x ",

      "Content": "Hi everyone Can anyone help me and tell me if its normal to still feel so uncomfortable and still be in a bit of pain 5 weeks after an LD flap? I had my op on the 27th June and the pain was so bad afterwards. I really didn't expect that even though my breast care nurses had gone through the op with me. They say I'm doing really well and maybe I'm expecting miracles, but I thought I'd bounce back quickly. I'm still taking quite strong pain killers as well.  I would love to hear from anyone who has had this op just to feel I'm not alone really and just let me know when I'll start to feel normal again.  Thank you in advance  Jwoowoo xxxxx ",

      "Content": "Hi Sharon and Dreamthief It's nice to meet someone else in the same position as me. My daughter has stopped me doing to much. So much so she's wrapped me in cotton wool so to speak, but maybe that was a good thing as I, like you Sharon, try to do to much. I've also had fluid drained off my back and I'm backwards and forwards to the hospital because my new boob has a leaky wound as well. I'm glad you say it can be one of the most successful procedures as I was beginning to wonder what I'd done. I'm doing the exercises the nurses gave me but I will certainly look up the exercises you recommend.  Thankyou for all your replies I know feel 'normal' and not so alone.  Jwoowoo x ",

      "Content": "Hi Heather Thank you so much for your reply. I really appreciate everyone taking the time to help me. I know I should be more patient and it's so nice to talk to people who have had the same op, and hearing your journeys.  I'm doing my exercises everyday but I haven't had physio. I may ask the breast care nurses tomorrow as I'm still going up the hospital for dressings change every week. My new boob is taking a while to heal. It is my back that is hurting the most and under my arm feels twice the size that it is.  Anyway Heather I will definitely try and relax more and get more sleep. It's so hard as I am always on the 'go'. My customers know I've got cancer and having the mastectomy with reconstruction but some of them only think of themselves. I've learnt that since being ill!!  Thank you again for your positive words, it really means a lot and it does help, more than you know.  You all take care of yourselves.  Love Jan xxxxxx",

      "Content": "Hi Heather  Lovely to hear from you, the advice I've received from you and everyone who took the time to read my woes, is wonderful thank you all so much.  It's interesting isn't it Heather you do find out who your friends are and who crosses the road because they don't know what to say. I'm lucky I've had a lot of support from my friends and that's lovely but they haven't been through this experience, and as much as they try and help, the support I've received on this site from people who are going through the same thing, has been brilliant, to say the least. I'm so grateful for the advice and I'm looking forward to the day I wake up feeling 'normal'. Thanks to you Heather I know that day will come.  Thankyou.  Sending you love and hugs Jan xxxx ",

      "Content": "Thank you everyone. I do appreciate your replies. My consultant is happy with everything and I suppose I should just be patient. It's just that I've never met anyone who's had this op at any of the clinics I've been to at the hospital. So just to hear from someone who's been through it would be lovely and compare our journeys. I couldn't have an implant as I'd previously had cancer in same breast with radiotherapy 14 years ago, so an implant was out of the question.  I look forward to hearing from anyone.  Love jwoowoo xxxxx",
