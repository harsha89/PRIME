      "Content": "Hi all. I need help. I hate having to ask. I've had my first chemo and was determined to remain positive. All my positiveness has gone and I don't want to go back for any more treatment.  The nurses said the first three weren't too bad, that it was the last 3 that were worse. I hate it. I was back at work on the Friday as I felt OK but it's just been a roller coaster since. I was bad on sunday, managed work on monday and tuesday and half day wednesday. My throat is awful - can't swallow very much, my mouth isn't much better and I feel wrecked. I just keep crying. Feel so pathetic!",

      "Content": "Hi jwoowoo I had an LD flap and reconstruction on 15 June this year - just over 6 weeks ago.  You sound like me. I thought i'd be up and running and recovering well - it was such a shock. The pain was nothing I could ever have imagined. I still find it uncomfortable and have only started to sleep on that side. I find my arm quite painful and cannot straighten it without a shooting pain. And my back is still sore. It's hard work. Quite normal I've been told. Get tired of everyone saying how well I look! It's 'good' (I know that's  not the right word) to know there is someone else going through the same. JackiRuss",

It took my mind off feeling sorry for myself and focused on something else. I'm always doing something so it worked for me. I started driving last week too. Still have a few aches but it's much better. Everyone is different though.",
