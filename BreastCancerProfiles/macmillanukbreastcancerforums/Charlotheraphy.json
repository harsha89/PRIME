      "Content": "Hi All,  I've had my second round of FEC and suffering from vein pain in my left arm (the side the chemo was administered). The nurse said I could have a line put in as an alternative but I have young children who like to jump and crawl all over me when possible. So am a bit worried about this option.  As I am having chemo before surgery they said I can have the cannula in the other arm but I'm naturally worried about having pain in both arms too. I do only have one lot of FEC left before the Taxotere which I'm told is easier on the veins. Can you help me with any tips of how to ease the pain/exercises? I have got some cream from doc but it's having limited effect.  Thanks in advance ",
