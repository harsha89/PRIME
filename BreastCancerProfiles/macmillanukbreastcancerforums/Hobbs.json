I have to say the staff were all very kind and understanding and did their best to put me at my ease. It's very strange to be put to sleep and wake up when it's all over but I have to say I was not in pain or uncomfortable and went home the same day. To help me stay calm a friend recommended rescue remedy that you spray on your tongue and it certainly made me feel calmer. Good luck on the 10th, I think the waiting and thinking are worse than the event and after the op, with clear margins, your cancer will be gone! Jan",

Just thought I'd let you know my GP recommended Avon Skin So Soft dry oil spray to use as an insect repellent. It contains Citronella and is also good for keeping your skin in good condition. Apparently the troops working abroad use it. It is kinder to use than the harsh chemicals found in most insect repellents. I was interested to see that swimming he,led to reduce swelling.

I'm going on holiday at the weekend so didn't combine the taping with lymph drainage just in case it upset things but when I get back I'm going to book in for MLD combined with taping. I find the sleeve just keeps things as they are so am searching for something that will improve the lymphoedema. Not sure how the measurements work but I started off at 7%, dropped to 1% which was great but then very suddenly shot up to 27%! I find the taping more comfortable than the sleeve, I too ended up with a glove too for the same reason as you. The taping needs to be renewed roughly every three days, I took my husband with me and he's confident he has learnt how to do it. We also took photos of how the physio applied the tape so we have a pattern to work to. I'll be happy to let you know progress although I do realise there's no quick fix for this condition. Take care Jan",
