      "Content": "Hi, listen to your body and don't overdo things but keep as active as you can. There are some specialist exercise classes around but not sure what are you are in. Whenever you have a side effect mention it to the chemo nurses as they have lots of experience and remedies. I'm a class of 2013 but didn't finish my treatment until 2014 as I had herceptin as well. I had all my lymph nodes removed as I had a small amount in one node. Take care and take any help you can xx",

      "Content": "Hi like you my lump was too big. I have just finished my chemo and have a mammogram and ultraound booked for 18th September and then a case conference will be held. I am an NHS patient and I couldn't be more please . I'm hoping for a to have lump removed but not sure what decision will be reached yet. It is a scary time for you and for me but there are a couple of things I have thought over my time...my hair will come back....I am going to survive whatever it takes. Talk through things with the professionals and ask Macmillian if you need an extra shoulder. Good luck",
