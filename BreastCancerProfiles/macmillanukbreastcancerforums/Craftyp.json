      "Content": "Hello All I joined this community about 2 years ago when being treated for breast cancer and it was an amazing support.  Now I desperately need some support again (reassurance ?).  I was going through chemo two years ago and had FEC-T.  I took tamoxifen for a few months too but this didn't agree with me and I was only weakly receptive to it so it was decided I would stop taking it. In November last year I had what I thought was a very heavy period, the first since March 2014.  Lasted about 8 days.  Then nothing until  mid Jan this year, a fairly normal period lasting 10 days.  And now for the last two weeks I have had a pretty light period with no issues..until today.  Woke up this morning and it is like the flood gates I have been turned on.   Can anyone relate to this ?  Is this just likely my periods coming back, albeit erratically ?  I am 43.  I was ok with it until this morning as it was around every 2 months and lasting around 9 days.  So just when I think I am at the end of another cycle it switches on full blast !  Two weeks seems a long time but then I had a long time with nothing at all so maybe the body just catching up ? Any reassurance would be really appreciated.  Going into panic mode at the moment !!  Thank you.",

      "Content": "Hi Julia - thanks for your response.  No, not taking anything now, just have a 6 monthly check up and an annual mammogram (last one was December - all fine). I have managed to get an appointment to see my GP tonight (which is a miracle in itself!!) so I am hoping I will get reassured everything is ok.  I will ask about being peri-menopausal, I hadn't really thought of that.  I am still in contact with my oncologist so I can probably see him tomorrow (I have left a message with symptoms, to see what he thinks). I feel much better for posting and for both replies.  Thank you so much.  Everything gets out of proportion so it is good to hear some common sense !",
