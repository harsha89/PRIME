      "Content": "Hellooooo.... *waves to all* Just wondered who else is still on the Dec Chemo club?  Has anyone else started just pre-Christmas?  I suppose it's been understandably quiet with the big day getting in the way.  I had my first FEC-T on Wed 20th.   Been feeling much more like myself again in the last couple of days.  Felt quite nauseous on the evening of the chemo but it was pretty well controlled over the next 3 days with Granisetron and the steroids.  Was constipated but that shifted eventually with the Laxido.  I did manage some Christmas lunch by naughtily taking the Granisetron for the other 2 days that I had tablets for, although the box said for 3 days.  It was Christmas Eve and Christmas Day!!!  I did feel very ropey on Boxing Day with only Metoclopromide left, with instructions to take as and when, but I felt it was actually adding to my stomach cramps, which was the main thing that was making me feel sick/dodgy.  I read somewhere on a thread that the Laxido could help with the stomach cramps so I continued to take it for a couple of days and think it did, but could have been placebo or it just cleared up anyway. Now feeling that slight morning sickness way that gets better as the day goes on.  Appetite coming back slowly.  The worst thing was that hubby had the flu about 2 days after my chemo and I was paranoid about getting it, and it also floored him for doing anything for me.  It was a weird, isolating weekend pre-Christmas with us all satelliting round each other in different rooms of the house.  Been sleeping well which is a massive bonus, I know.  Trying to get out each day for a walk with the dog as the fresh air helps.  I have had a lot of migraines, worst on Xmas Day.  I think due to dehydration and the salty food, and probably just doing too much.  Been taking ibuprofen after taking my temp.  I read that chemo can exacerbate your weak spots and I've always been headachey and I've had some stonkers this week.  All in all, it's not been pleasant but not as bad as I was expecting.  I'm avoiding the shops etc this week due to low immune system, although it's a hell of a time to book an online shopping slot!!  They're like gold-dust.  Attempting a drive to my mum's tomorrow for a visit whilst I still have my hair :-(  How's everyone else?  xxx",

I will be getting 6 rounds of FEC-T, 3 weeks apart. All being well, fingers crossed, I have already mapped out that my last will be 4 April.  Good call on the notebook.  I have one.  Main thing is to write down anything you have to do - ie other appointments to book.  And any questions you can think of in advance.  My husband just took his tablet and either was with me in the waiting rooms or sat in the café at the hospital for my long day of tests.  He drank a lot of coffee.  All the best tomorrow and Friday xx",

      "Content": "Hi Mavi, Just wanted to send you my support.  The waiting and testing bit is the worst.  I'm only a couple of weeks ahead of you as I was diagnosed with my biopsy results on the 6 Dec and had my first chemo today.  I have the type of cancer where it is better to have the chemo first to shrink the tumour and then operation. It is totally natural to feel scared and overwhelmed.  The tests can be invasive and worrying.  I just had an MRI on my breasts yesterday and honestly thought I was OK but then a bit of panic hits you again.  A good tip that helped me was to close my eyes and transport myself in my mind somewhere nice.  I imagined I was stroking my cat and that really really helped.  Sometimes I picture myself on a Caribbean beach - really go to town on the whole imagery.  And they are over before you know it.  Do try to let friends help you.  A friend said a lovely thing to me.  That there will be days when I want to close the door on the world, but leave it ajar just a little so that someone can reach in with a helping hand.  Right now, I am trying not to interfere in letting my husband wrap the Christmas presents!  :-) Wishing you all the best for tomorrow.  And do have a good cry.  It releases the stress hormones.

I just finished my Herceptin jabs in Feb.  You think it seems like forever in the beginning but you will get there.  All the best, Linda xx",

Don't know what I would have done without them.  Wishing you all the best, Linda xx",

I was diagnosed in early Dec and started my chemo on 20 Dec.  Am now half way through the chemo but still due the operation and RT thereafter.  I do have my name down for the 'Look Good Feel Better' session in March at Maggie's.  Phone up Monday and get yourself booked in as they are really popular and get booked up a couple of months in advance.  It's a beauty session where you get a really good goody-bag apparently.  I'd be happy to meet up sometime if you like - I'm off work for the duration of my treatment.  Lovely to hear from you.

      "Content": "HI Kem, I also have breast lymphoedema and was referred by my BCN to a specialist nurse, who I will keep seeing until we seen an improvement.  She was great and showed me massage techniques and some exercises as it's important to keep moving the area.  All of what she showed me can be done by me on my own - seems strange to say you need a helper, although of course if you have a partner they might be keen, ha ha!  It would be a good idea to see a specialist nurse if you can, as I would have had no idea about the type of touch needed from a leaflet.  Much more confident now someone has shown me.  It did seem quite a soft touch but she explained that the lymph system is just under the skin, and adhered to the skin.  So you only need to move the skin gently or your fingertips over the skin to have an effect.  Unlike Grannylara, I didn't find the kinesio tape helped me much but the massage is effective. I did specifically ask the nurse if it ever goes away completely and she said it can.  If you keep up the massage, it will get better and better and eventually either not come back or be much less if so.  Another tip is that you can use a body brush to do the massage technique.  I suffer from frozen shoulder so it makes it easier for me to reach around, under my boob and into my armpit with the brush.  All the best, Linda x",

      "Content": "Hi Rosie, Please don't be worried.  For one thing, like the chemo, it always helps to keep reminding yourself what a good job the Herceptin is doing for you.  Personally, I found it very hard to distinguish what SE were Herceptin and what were 1) hanging over from the chemo, 2) tamoxifen, 3) symptoms of the sudden menopause caused by chemo and tamoxifen.  I finished my Herceptin at the beginning of Feb this year and have had some ongoing things to contend with since finishing chemo in April last year and getting radiotherapy June/July - joint stiffness, some joint pain, and fatigue - but all of these have gradually got better the further away from chemo and RT that I got.  The joint stiffness has lingered though and doesn't seem to be getting any better so I'm sure that's the tamoxifen/menopause.  I did also have a bit of a runny nose and very dry eyes which some people attribute to Herceptin.  I got my optician on side and he prescribed gel to put in at night and drops to put in as and when you need.  That really helped.  The one thing I do think that was Herceptin SE was a dull ache in my lower back.  It's been much better since stopping.  Never needed painkillers for it so I it wasn't severe, just uncomfortable.  I'm sure you will get on fine with it.  Once you are finished with your main treatment, just doing the Herceptin feels like you are getting on with life.  Looking back, I think a lot of my side effects over the last year have been from the chemo because they got better gradually, even though I was on herceptin.  It takes your body a long time to get rid of chemo and repair.  Best wishes, Linda x",

      "Content": "Hi Julie, It is normal, honest.  I am about 6 weeks post-RT and just the same - some days worse than others with the fatigue.  I'm also on tamoxifen and Herceptin, so we are still getting pumped with drugs and tamoxifen can have quite a few side effects, never mind that the chemo'tamoxifen might have put you into menopause very rapdicly (it has me), with all that can entail.  I'm taking a myriad of supplements that are supposed to be good for stiff joints, so that might help if you haven't tried yet (although I still feel it).  Do you feel ready to go back to work?  It sounds like the added pressure of that and your money situation is not helping with your stress.  Your employer should treat those recovering from cancer as having a disability and make reasonable adjustments - a phased return for example.  It probably depends on your workplace however, what their pay policy is for phased return.  I know ours was changed lately and they will only pay you for days worked.  (I was one of the union stewards who fought against this, and ironically I'll now be subject to it!)  I am on half-pay just now and my sick line runs out in a week and a  half so I probably will go back, and will just have to tighten our belts as much as possible as I know I will need the phased return.  It's a scary thought, work, though. You absolutely should just feel how you feel.  No right and wrong about when you should have 'gotten over it'.  If there is one thing I have taken from this wonderful community and the ladies who post their experiences on here is that I will feel up and down for a long time, as we have gone through such a major life change, and to not feel guilty about that. Difficult for people IRL to understand, but we do.  And the emotions can be conflicting.  Sometimes I look in the mirror, for example, and am quite positive about my hair growing back (veeerrryyy slowly) and think it looks quite funky.  Other times I could cry and am really angry that I don't look like 'me' any more and just want my old blonde bob back now.  Often I get annoyed at people saying how brave I am (not that I would show that to their face as they are just being kind) but I feel quite angry that I'm not because I didn't have any choice and just had to face it all anyway.  But other times, I think about what I have been through, and do feel brave.  You will be a jumble of all these emotions and it's normal, honey.  I'm glad you wrote and got it out though.  Better out than in, as my mum used to say! Much love and hugs, Linda xx (I've been crying writing this reply!)",

      "Content": "I've thought the same about the April chemo thread - will be very glad to 'graduate' from here with last chemo tomorrow (touch wood)! DL  - oral thrush can be a problem with T.  I've had it each cycle and in fact have a GP appt for Thurs to get some meds for it in advance.  Haven't really had too much pain, thank goodness, so can't advise on that.  I do still (on day 20 this cycle) get an aching in legs if I go upstairs, like bad fatigue.  This seems to have been cumulative and suspect it might just take a while to go after last one, and I'll probably also need to build up my general fitness after sitting around so much for the last few months.  JammyR - there are a few things that I have got from the chemist which have helped other than the main prescribed meds.  I had seen a few of these on the 'chemo tips' list but never needed them on FEC and have needed all of them on T.  Baby toothbrush, baby toothpaste (normal stuff far too stingy with peeling mouth!), indigestion medicine, IBS medicine that contains peppermint oil (the peppermint tea wasn't enough for my tummy cramps in the end), dry eye drops, mouthwash for dry mouth.  I wouldn't rush out and get the last 4 there until you see if you have these symptoms but handy to know that they're readily available to you.  My skin has also been a lot drier on T so slather on whatever is a your normal moisturiser, and a good lip balm.  I did get a red rash on my face for a few days but it soon cleared up without me doing anything special other than moisturising.  I have been a lot more tired on T so do take it easy as much as you can.    Cheers, Linda xx",

We know each other through an online forum and have never met so I picked up the phone and called her.
