    "Content": "It's been 3 years since my mastectomy, full lymph node removal, 6 months of chemo and RT. Why do I still feel tired, and emotional? I am a Nursery nurse and work hard, but I do have school holidays to recover, and my children are grown up, I don't have to hare around after them. My son has been through a traumatic time at Uni, which hasn't helped the stress levels, and my GP has referred me for counselling. But I wonder, how many of you feel that you might still suffer the after- effects of treatment? When I get a cold I feel it takes me longer to recover than other people. Am I imagining it?",
