      "Content": "Dreamthief Hi, It's not that they are rubbish as such, they all do a great job but any of these tablets can and will cause side effects (which are rubbish) some get affected more than others but it's mostly the lack of oestrogen ( a feelgood hormone) which is behind it all. Tamoxifen may be the better one for you, no one really knows until an alternative is tried for a couple of months. A lot of ladies have switched for whatever reasons and all that happened was they swapped one lot of side effects for another There is a lot more information about hormone therapies here (link) it is an American cancer site but they go into far more detail explaining things. thank you I will take a look at that",

      "Content": "Dreamthief Hi Nanks   Unfortunately if you only had radiotherapy the answer is probably yes Up to the menopause most of your oestrogen is produced by the ovaries - post menopause oestrogen is still produced by the body in the adrenal glands and from body fat cells, - being ER+ you still need protection from this risk. Your onco will know your ER score (8 is the highest figure) which means strongly receptive only between you can you figure out which will be best way for you long term. Carrying on with the Tamoxifen or switching to aromtase inhibitor type tablets like letrozole, anastrozole or exemestane. The AI type tablets can cause bone aches and thinning which can lead to osteopaenia - so they are all a bit rubbish really. If you had chemo as a whole body treatment chances are your recurrence risk would be low enough to not have the tablets and take your chances but if you didn't have chemo the tablets are the only thing acting on your whole body. Radiotherapy is only a 'localised' treatment. Unfortunately recurrence doesn't always come back in the breast. The other breast, bone, lung, liver are also areas that can be affected I would phone your oncologist for an appt to work out your risks. G n' J thank you for your answer I will make a appointment you also say the other tablets are rubbish so in your opinion am I on the best one in tamoxifen ",

      "Content": "Dreamthief Hi Nanks   Thickening of the womb lining and other gyne issues can be side effects of Tamoxifen. If they are wanting you to resume Tamoxifen in a few weeks I'm assuming they didn't remove your ovaries with the hysterectomy ? There are alternatives to Tamoxifen but they are used mostly for those who are post menopause whose ovaries have stopped producing oestrogen.  It is possible to switch off the ovaries to stop producing oestrogen by using drugs like Zoladex you could possibly have one of the other types of tablet then, but tbh they all come with side effects of one sort or another You need to have a chat with your oncologist about any options available but now you have had the hysterectomy you would think you no longer have the the main problem area. What other back up treatments to help avoid the risk of recurrence have you had - chemo, radiotherapy etc ? G n' J I have had all removed ovaries as well I had radiotherapy as well I'm just confused as to do I need any of these meds anymore and if so is tamoxifen the best for me ",

      "Content": "I have just had a total hysterectomy after being on tamoxifen for a year and a half and the doctor saying it was probably the tamoxifen that caused the tumour to grow I'm lucky it was benign but I was told to stop the tamoxifen 4weeks before op and for 4weeks after op I have been looking at tamoxifen and I'm not sure if I want to stay on it I'm scared that if I do not my breast cancer will return any help please ",
