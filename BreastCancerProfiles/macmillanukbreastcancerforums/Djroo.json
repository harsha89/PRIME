      "Content": "I have recently been diagnosed with breast cancer. I rang my insurance and they asked if I had any letters confirming my diagnosis - luckiky  I had. I sent them a copy and they contacted the hospital to verify them - apparently this was all confirmed over the phone. My claim was accepted quite quickly.  Have you got any letters from the hospital which you could send to them? ",
