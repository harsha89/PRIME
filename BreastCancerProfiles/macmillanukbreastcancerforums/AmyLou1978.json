      "Content": "Hi Vickster I thought I would chip in as I too am in education (secondary school MFL) I was diagnosed August 2014 and was basically off for all of last academic year whilst I had treatment (chemo, surgery, rads and just coming to end of herceptin.  Fortunately, my school have been supportive on the whole and have let me go back part time. We all know how stressful and demanding teaching is and quite frankly I was struggling beforehand so my diagnosis came as a massive wake up call. I would just say to be brutally honest with occ health - I found them to be supportive but equally I was quite clear about what I felt able to take on. Unless you've walked down this path, no one has the right to pass judgment on the way you feel. I've had a few remarks about my hours on my return, but I simply do not have the time/ inclination or energy to be riled by it. Some people will amaze you with their ignorance. You are number one. Put your feelings first and take good care of yourself. X x",

My skin didn't really change colour, but then again it didn't on my chest area either. Interestingly, I've noticed more side effects after the treatment ended - I'm about 5 weeks post finishing radio now. Hope this helps xx",

      "Content": "Hi Denise I thought I would share as our stories seem quite similar. I was diagnosed last Aug - underwent chemo first, then RH mx. Following surgery, the consultant informed me that all of the cancer had gone from my breast tissue - amazing considering the lump was almost 6cm toache  begin with. Of ten lymph nodes, two had cancer cells. Like you, I ever between being happy and fretting about those two nodes (even tho the onc said it was quite normal to have some remnants) and I'm now at the stage where every ache and pain is freaking me out. I'm finding it hard to adjust so I will certainly look into the book you mention. I'm starting radio soon and going for my planning session next week. Lots of love to you xxx",

Be good to yourself and more importantly be kind to yourself. You and your body have been through a huge amount and the anticipation of surgery will have taken it out of you mentally as well. Lots of self care is what you need right now, so feet up with a good book, lots of tea and positive thinking. I'm keeping everything crossed for your results. Do let us know. Lots of love to you x x",

      "Content": "Hi there I love dogs and, after many months of persuading, my husband finally agreed to get one. Then I was diagnosed in Aug last year. After careful consideration we decided to still go ahead and we got Ralph, our terrier cross, from a rescue centre just as I had completed the first chemo.. One of the best moves I made. Yes, you need to be careful and dogs are of course a big responsibility but he has provided us with so much  joy and love. As others have said, one if the important things he does is make me go outside, even if it is just to stand in the garden with my coat on! Pets do sense when you are not feeling quite right, and he will often come and simply rest his head on my lap. We rescued him but I think equally he's rescued me.Good luck with whatever you decide.

I was not given the option of lumpectomy, I think due to the positioning/size of the lump. I was given the option of immediate recon by surgeon but onc wanted me to wait - I went with the latter view and have not regretted it. I am inclined to go down the recon route but at the moment have left that decision for a while. If you want to message me, please feel free.",
