      "Content": "Hi, sorry to hear of your concerns regarding your treatment. I have been under the care of the same hospital but have been happy with my care. Regarding pathology results I had an appointment 2 weeks post op for these but they weren't available and I had to return a week later, this did cause me some anxiety but in hindsight a few days doesn't make a difference and at least treatment is in progress. I hope you get some answers and can continue your treatment with confidence in the team looking after you",

      "Content": "Hi, I'm starting radiotherapy this week and like you have read good things about R1 and R2. I wrote to my GP requesting a prescription and printed out the information sheet from the website for her information and she did prescribe it for me. It took a few days for local pharmacy to source it, but I now have it ready and waiting.  It's worth asking GP, they can only say no and if that's the case it can be purchased from pharmacy. Good luck with your treatment ",

I used the Paxman system but this was referred to as coldcapping - it worked really well for me and I was so pleased that I had the opportunity to use this. Not sure about the terminology - cold cap and scalp cooling do seem to be interchangeable!",

Reviewed by doctor today - she asked what I was using on skin, she hadn't heard of R1/2, but happy for me to continue using it. Her advice was that current guidelines do not recommend any particular cream, just one that suits the individual and does not contain any metallic particles.",

      "Content": "Hi Cocopops, so sorry you're in this position. I too ignored changes in my breast for all kinds of reasons, it was probably about 8 months before I saw GP, she was clearly very concerned and I was quickly seen at hospital - it was made clear at this first appointment that it was cancer, confirmed a week later by biopsy. I was terrified it had spread and couldn't believe I had put myself and my family in this position. Luckily scans clear, and I started on hormone treatment to shrink the tumour, I completed treatment 5 months ago and have been back at work for 3 months now. I can honestly say all the treatments were manageable, I now feel better than ever - I have taken control of my life, lost weight, taken up exercise. It's scary - I've had days where I've been terrified it's spread, but I'm still here trying to keep positive. None of us knows what's in store for us and we can only deal with what we know. Whatever the outcome of your biopsy you will cope, the waiting for results is the worst but trust your team, it won't be easy but you will find a strength you may not know you have, good luck xxx",
