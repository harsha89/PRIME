    "Content": "Hi  I wondered how your treatment was going? Are you getting a good response? Did you have chemo the first time round as well? I have just been diagnosed with my 3rd TNBC recurrence and they've told me it has spread to my lungs too. I have two kids aged 10 and 8. I am trying to decide whether to go on a trial with a PARP inhibitor plus taxol and carbo or whether to just take Xeloda. It's so difficult isn't it? What can you do? I think there are many new treatments being developed and I'm just hoping I can hang on so I can try some of them out.  Do you have a good support network? I hope you're tolerating the chemo ok and that it's responding. I feel shocked too. I'm gutted because this time round the tumour was the smallest and I had a double mastectomy last time to try and prevent this happening again. Life's unfair isn't it?! Sending positive vibes and please contact me if you want to chat. x",
