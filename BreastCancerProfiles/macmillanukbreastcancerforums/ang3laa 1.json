      "Content": "hi wondered if anyone can help? i have just been diagnosed on the 8th april and go for my lumpectomy on the 30th april. i have been told that i will definately go on to chemo and radiotherapy and was wondering if it was possible to work during treatment. i am a childminder with 2 children aged 2 and another aged 5. i have 3 children of my own the youngest being 10 years old. they say that due to my line of work i risk infection from the children i look after and have said that i may not be able to work. my problem is that i am a single parent, with no money from the kids father and i am not entitled to benefit as i am self employed. if i dont work i dont get paid and the children i have may go elsewhere for childcare as i cant supply my service. (cant blame the parents, they need to work and cant take sick days off because of me!) meaning i will have no income! i was wondering if anyone could let me know how they felt during treatment and if they managed to get on with work. i work from 7.30am until 5.30pm monday to friday and dont get a break. i am on my own as both my parents died of cancer in december 2008. so have no family support. thanks x  ",

      "Content": "me again! im sure il get used to this soon, lol! its hard to think that im going to feel ill when i dont feel bad just now! the lump was not sore until i had my biopsy and as i am never ill, i just keep thinking that i will be fine and be able to carry on as normal after my op and during treatment. i have never met anyone on the same journey as i am on and it was good to hear from you all and it has made me realise that i will have to give up work. my health is more important. i have holidays booked to canada in the summer and in october and i think i am in denial as i have not cancelled them yet. keep thinking that i will be fine and able to go, think its because i dont want to disappoint my kids! i now understand that its time to stop and just get better and forget about everything else. just me and my kids, that all thats important now. omg <gush!> anyway thanks again, love to you all x  ",

      "Content": "thank for that! had my lumpectomy on friday, feeling good apart from the numb, pins and needly  arm. think ive come to terms with things now, although i dont get results until the 12th (counting the days!) decided to tell my kids then, too! :( holiday in august cancelled, as my consultant said \"no way will i get!\" theres always next year once treatment is over. plus my travel insurance runs out in july and i dont know how expensive its going to be to get insurance now! i have set a date for my hair cut, as i have been told that i will loose it with the type of chemo they are going to give me (my hair is long, so pixie style before it goes!) sending love and hope everything goes well with the rest of your wifes treatment x    ",
