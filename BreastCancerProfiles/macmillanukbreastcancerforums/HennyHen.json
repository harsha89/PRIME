    "Content": "Hi Pat Hen here. I finished my 6 month chemo sessions in February and have been clear since then. I still have numb toes and balls of feet. THought my big toes nails would come off but they have stayed but look a bit manky. My fingers are nearly back to normal.  Was glad to get my lashes and brows back as I felt I was me again. Good luck with the brillo pad hair - maybe you could start a new craze!! So I guess everyone is different.  I think my feet maybe numb forever!!! Really need to get them professionally massaged for a period and see if that helps - did ask if could get on NHS - cheeky I know but I wish to make the most of freebees as I have only been entitled when pregnant before.   Body shop Hemp cream for feet or hands had been good for dryness. LOve and luck Hen xxxxxxx",
