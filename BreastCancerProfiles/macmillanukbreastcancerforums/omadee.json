    "Content": "Hi Nicki, sorry to hear yr mum has breast cancer, its good that you and yr sister do come and support her.  I also live in Spain and have Her2 breast cancer.  I had my chemotherapy at the hospital in Torrevieja and see my oncoogist every three months.  I have moved to Andalusia now but maybe can help you with any questions you might have regardng treatment in Spain.  I firmly believe that the Spanish Health system is much more uptodate with their treatment of cancer than anyother european country and am glad that I live here and receive excellent care from hospital, oncologist and primary doctor. Please do not hesitate to ask any questions you may have, I would be happy to help in anyway, take care and try not to worry too much, the treatment for Her2 breast cancer is much better these days and there are many targeted drugs out now.  Google is not a good place to go because a lot of the information is out of date and can be frightening, I was diagnosed and treated in 2010 and am fit and healthy.  I still see my oncologist on a regular basis and have now changed to six monthly visits.   take care Denise",
