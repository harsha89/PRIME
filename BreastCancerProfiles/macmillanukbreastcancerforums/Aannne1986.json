    "Content": "Hi. I had surgery 3weeks ago and went for my rad planning session last Friday. I asked why I needed it and was told to kill off any rogue cells and stop it coming back. So yours is in no way a silly question but very sensible. As I am anxious about it I asked oncologist and radiographer for stats on recurrence for people who refuse rad therapy but no one seemed to know if there are any. Surgeon said I'd had the wrong op if I was going to refuse RT don't really feel there's much choice. Good luck with your recovery. I didn't find the surgery as bad as I thought it would be though x",
