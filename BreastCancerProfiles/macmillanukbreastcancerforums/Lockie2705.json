    "Content": "Hi Penny, I was diagnosed with Breast Cancer at 27 back in June. I know that it feels like it has got you but now that you (and the docs) know its there they will do everything they can to make sure that it goes. Remember you are bigger and stronger than than the Cancer and at times it will seem like the hardest thing in the world but you must keep fighting! I am now in remission and have been taking tamoxifen for the past 2 weeks and have had no side effects (touch wood!). I think it effects each person different so lets hope that you don't get them. Take Care x",
