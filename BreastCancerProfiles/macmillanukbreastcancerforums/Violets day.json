      "Content": "Hi I have my op this week I was diagnosed on the 10th Nov 17 I\u2019m a positive person but the reality has really hit me hence writing this at 3am! I need lots of advice on after care from a lumpoptomy lymph node removal ( I\u2019m having a wire to check under arm area ) and radiotherapy on my left side and how to avoid lymphodemia. I have a lot of pain already in my right arm from a frozen shoulder and arthritis in my neck so get a lot of nerve pain but this will have to become my strong arm now due to op being on left breast ... I\u2019ve always done yoga and Swim but obviously will not be able to do this for some time .... I feel this is the start of my journey and am hoping for some helpful words please",

      "Content": "Hello everyone I had my follow up appointment today after my lumpectomy for ductal cancer 15mm and the wire  treatment for 2 lymph nodes removed on the 30th November ..... my emotions were all over the place but news was so positive today All Cancer removed - clear in the lymph nodes so no spread - I\u2019m still facing the radiotherapy at the end of January and have been prescribed Tamoxifen to start asap ... I would like to ask the lovely community on here about their experiences in both areas and any tips to help me on the journey ?  I feel really lifted today ...... I\u2019ve realised  for sometime what  the positivity of passing on goodness and gathering the right people , animals ,places and general day to day living  into your life and how it makes a difference to each day ..... but the last few weeks gave me a strength I never knew or imagined I had and I believe that comes from everything that I\u2019ve gathered in to my world ....... long may it continue .... love and light to you all",
