    "Content": "Hi Lizzie 55, My 1st reason for replying to your post is I'm a bit lost on this site & def haven't worked out how to make max use of it . I had a left side mastectomy & all my lymph nodes removed in 2004. I was given a heart shaped hand made cushion to hug after surgery. I can remember the numbness & some discomfort . It did get better & all these years later I don't have any pain or numbness now. Hope that's some comfort to you",
