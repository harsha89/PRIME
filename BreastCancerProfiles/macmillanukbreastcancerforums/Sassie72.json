    "Content": "Glad to hear it went well for you. I had the same two procedures last Friday. I too can't fault the breast unit team. Especially my surgeon. My lump was quite high up so just after I went to sleep he decided to go cut under it and go up for it, if that makes sense. It would mean I wouldn't have a scar above my bra line. Harder for him to do and it did mean more pain for me, but so considerate. I've got three kids including a 9 month old, so unfortunately avoiding lifting him wasn't something I could really do. My husband did his best but I've just had to learn to put most of the weight onto my left side. The blue wee was also actually quite funny. Something to smile about is great when you're feeling low. Results a week today, so fingers crossed for good news, good luck to you too. Like the said, the battle is on!!",
