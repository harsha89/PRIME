      "Content": "So this might be a stupid question but I will ask anyway since have my biopsy my boob has been sore and I was told to expect that I have the bruise to show for it too. It just doesn't feel right though it's sore and more sensitive than before the biopsy is that normal?  Also between now and my surgery what am I supposed to do in terms of activity do I just carry on with my normal daily tasks or do I take it easier? Ridiculous as it sounds I'm scared that if I do to much then it will make the cancer worse?? ",

      "Content": "Thank you all for your kind words and suppprt, it's comforting to know that I'm not alone going through this nightmare. I seriously hate this disease it's hideous and cruel I'm sick of crying today I'm just so angry my head hurts.  My boys are 9 and 5 and my little girl is 3. My 9 yr old was devastated and it was heart breaking to watch all I could do was cuddle him. My 5 yr old didn't really get and my little girl is oblivious!  So now I've had chance to breath and digest all the info thrown at me today I have a few concerns. The type I have is invasive ductal breast cancer provisionally graded 3. I was told not to google but I have, I'm concerned at the grade 3 this means that it is fast growing so now I'm worried about waiting till 9 June for my lumpectomy. I want this out now before it spreads any further. ",

I have lots to keep me busy and a fab circle of friends to keep me company. My husband and kids are my world and have been great so far. I'm also being totally honest with my boys who know what is happening my eldest has become very clingy not wanting to leave my side at the mo but I'm sure as time goes on he will relax more.  ",
