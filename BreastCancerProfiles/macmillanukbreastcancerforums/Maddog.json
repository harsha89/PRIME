Glad you're doing well and positive about starting chemo. Make sure you ask for lots and lots of local for your biopsy and you'll be fine. Big hugs huni xx",

      "Content": "Hi, I'm so sorry that you're joining us in this journey. I'm also newly diagnosed and am having 2 lumpectomies tomorrow. My daughters are 10 and 12 and they have been absolutely amazing. I played it down to them, told I'd be having an operation to remove the lumps and then I'd have to have treatment that might make me a bit poorly but I'd be ok. Lots of reassurance is the key. Told mine to ask me anything they wanted to know and not to worry about it being silly or upsetting me. My youngest is excited about my smurf Boobie and the possibility of a blue poo ;-) the oldest was a little teary to start and then took strength from my reaction. I've been totally positive, cried very little and given lots of fighting talk :) being strong and positive is the way to go. We've booked to do pretty mudder next year to raise money for breast cancer and they will be busying themselves with getting sponsors. I've been honest and upfront and am telling them everything as I find out so they don't think I'm hiding anything. Good luck for your results. I waited til I had the firm diagnosis from my biopsies before telling the girls, no way is the right way...it's just whatever is the right way for you and your family. Lots of love and hugs Hannah x",

      "Content": "Hi, I'm so sorry that you're going through this too :( I'm 35 and was diagnosed 27th August with IDC, high grade, 2 seperate lumps. I went to the mammogram on my own as I was sure it was just a muscle, and left after 5 biopsies in tears as the radiologist. Told me they def weren't cysts :( my husband was also working away in America at the time and wasn't here when I got the results of cancer. I think everyone reacts differently Hun. I've had very few tears and am just trooping on, but I have my ups and downs. Have had two operations as they didn't get clear margins the first time and am waiting for my results of the second op now. I think one thing we must all take strength from is that anything we have to go through treatment wise is better than the alternative. I have two daughters (10 and 12) who have been a pillar of strength. My husband has his ups and downs too but generally does what I need him too when I'm tired. Use your friends as strength to pull you through. I'm guessing they'll do genetic tests for you as you're third generation? Def push for this. I think it gets easier once you've hot your diagnosis and things start happening...it's the not knowing tests worse. Big hugs to you, if I can be of any help message me. Hannah xxx",

      "Content": "Thank you all for your lovely replies, my friends are fabulous but it's so nice to be able to talk to people who have been/are still going through treatment and understand what I'm going through. Madwife, it's reassuring to know that 12 years later you're still here...I've just got to the stage where I'm paranoid that once I've won this battle it'll creep up on me again :( I've got quite 'lumpy' boobs anyway so have found myself drawing a diagram of where they are so I know if anything changes...a little OTT :-) I'm trying to limit the amount of google time I do, now I have discovered this forum hopefully I'll be able to fire off my fears to people here. JuJuxx - you're so brave, I hope I can be as brave as you throughout the treatment process. I'm guessing yours was fairly large when found? Mine are 14mm and 4mm, so fairly small I think compared to what some are dealing with. From what I understand, young people are usually offered chemo. If I'm offered it I'll def take it, but from all the awful side effects you can have it's losing my hair that's the worst fear :( have you lost your hair? Do you find that you can still do a few jobs at home? Like making dinner and putting the washing on? I'm unsure as to what to expect :( Before your surgery maybe try and get a session of CBT, I've got one booked on Monday so I can control my anxiety before the op. I'll let you know if it helps. Mrs Meag - you're so young too :( I really feel for you and especially as you have such a little one to look after and fear for. My girls are 12 and 10 and very grown up for their years...they've been a better help than the husband so far lol! But you will kicks it arse, keep believing this! How is chemo going for you? Are you managing to look after your little one at all. You need to focus on your child and it's that that's going to pull you through this. I'm struggling to 'let go' as I'm trying to carry on regardless at the mo. I have overdone it a few days and then struggled the following day but I'm so determined that it won't effect me...I know I'll have to once treatment starts. Do you manage to still do some everyday jobs? It's reassuring that your husband was the same at the start. Think mine is concerned as he has no children of his own and now it may never happen. It's a big play off it you have hormone + cancer to 'risk' having another. He doesn't really talk much about the cancer but he does every now and agin mention that he doesn't think we'll have a baby together. He's jealous of his friends as they've all got children. I want him to be open with me, but he's making me feel guilty ATM :( My fear is that cancer is going to put a massive stress on our marriage and we won't manage to come out the other side. Think you ladies are amazing and am sending all my love and hugs your way. We'll kick cancers arse together :-) Han xx",

      "Content": "Hi Sue, I found the bet way to tell them was to be honest. I was 'lucky' in that my ex mother in law had breast cancer three years ago and they saw her come throrugh it so after the initial shock they were fine. My youngest was more excited about the possibility if a blue poo and tears than she was upset about the cancer. My eldest is fairly quiet but asks questions as she needs too. I had a lumpectomy and SNB on 16th September. Unfortunately one lump of the two removed didn't have clear margins so I had to have another operation a couple of days ago. Originally I was petrified as I'd never had an op before but this last time I took it in my stride. Do you know anything about your cancer yet? Type? Stage? Hannah xxx",

Thank you for the heads up on the fb page Lyndsey, I've just been on and liked it so I can go back and post. I've got to say though that this forum has made me feel like I have support out there. My family and friends are brilliant but they don't really understand what we're going through. You're being very brave Lyndsey and one day your little girl will look back at this whole time with you and be proud of the courage that you've had. Keep going ladies, every step may get harder but keep going, the view at the top is beautiful :-) Hannah xx",

      "Content": "Hi ladies, I was diagnosed with IDC, grade 2, Hormone +on 27th August and have been in a bubble ever since. I found the thickening of the skin on my honeymoon and went straight to the doctor on my return. Mammogram, ultrasound and biopsies on the same day confirmed TWO seperate IDC. Have had an MRI scan due to my age to confirm the above and am booked in for two lumpectomies on Tuesday. I've never had an operation before and am absolutely terrified. Have been told that I'll need radiotherapy and hormone therapy but, when I ask about chemo I get the same response each time...\"young people respond well to chemotherapy!\" I'm guessing he's telling me I'll probably have it in a round about way. I suffer with bad anxiety anyway and have not been in a good way since the diagnosis. I have two young daughters whom have taken the news so well, my husband is also being supportive but is struggling to come to terms with the diagnosis and is treating it like I've got a cold :'( Has anyone else's husband refused to acknowledge there is an issue? He is staying away from our friends and becoming a bit of a social recluse. I'm driving myself crazy googling stuff. I've been positive the whole way through and am adamant I will kick it's arse but I keep reading about women worried about it returning. I hadn't thought about this as I was focusing on the here and now. I'm now worried that I've been quite nonchalant about it and should be more concerned?! The consultant says he thinks it's probably stage 1 if not stage 2 and he doesn't think there is any lymph node involvement. Am I likely to have chemo? I'm also extra upset as my husband and I were trying for a baby. As I'm 35 age isn't on our side...if I have chemo, radio and hormone treatment will I be able to carry a child of our own? Could someone that is further down the line and a little more 'in the know' advise me? Best regards Hannah xx",

      "Content": "Hi Lil Nic x, Thank you so much for your response. You're being so brave, just hope I'll be as good next week :( I'm having 2 lumpectomy instead of a partial mastectomy as my cancers aren't joined...although this is a good thing cosmetically (2 scars instead of 1/4 boob missing) I'm extra worried as why would I be unlucky enough to get cancer twice at 35? Were your lymph nodes clear? I'm wondering if I'll have to have two taken, one by each cancer? The consultant hasn't said and I'm in a bit of a daze when I'm in there. How long do you have to inject yourself for? Not sure I'll be 'man' enough to so that :( how do they harvest the eggs? I'm assuming after all treatment is done then it would be IVF when you want a Bubs? Do you have a partner? Are you being supported through this? Of course you're gonna come out of it and be stronger at the end! Kicking cancers arse is what keeps me going...it def ain't gonna get me :) I've just signed up for pretty mudder next year with 13 of my girlfriend and my daughters :) even if I've have to walk it I'm doing it for every single person that has to fight this horrible disease.

I am also a teacher and I can't wait to get back to the kids at school. I have 4 GCSE classes sitting exams next year and with no other specialist teacher in the department I'm fearful for them :( I've got 2 IDC one is 14mm and the other 4mm, grade 2, hormone positive. I've got to have wires put in as my consultant can't feel the lumps either :( this process is terrifying me as when I had my core biopsies the local anaesthetic hadn't kicked in and I almost hit the roof! Did you feel it? How big were they? My operation is booked for Tuesday. I've never had an operation or GA and am petrified :( feel like a big baby really. I've got everything crossed for your results Hun. Please let me know how you get on. Be assured the kids will survive without us, we'll miss them more than they miss us I'm sure. Big hugs Hannah x",
