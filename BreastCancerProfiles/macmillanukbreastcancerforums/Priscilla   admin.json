It's fine to express the fact that it upsets you when people impose their religion on you, but we can't let that spill over into attacking people's faith. I've therefore taken out some parts of this thread that were offending some people. Those of you who do have religious faith, you may be interested in the Prayer Support group on the Community. Rather than adding any more comments to this thread, can you use the group that is relevant to you, in order to avoid upsetting those who are in the other group? Thanks. Priscilla",

      "Content": "Hi Kev, We certainly don't think that it's wrong for people to express the fact that religion is not helpful to them and I didn't mean to give that impression. I hope that I can answer your points: 1. We are not trying to single out non-believers by asking them to post in the atheists group, as we have also pointed believers to the prayer group. That way, each has a space to express their views without upsetting the others. 2. Giving either group the chance to 'convert' the other to their point of view is very much not the point of this Community, nor do I think that anyone in this thread set out to do so. I strongly disagree that most atheists would think they 'might as well not bother' expressing their views to other atheists, and likewise with religious people. The point of the initial post was for atheists to discuss how to deal with religious people who they felt were imposing their views on them. It therefore makes perfect sense for them to have that discussion in the relevant group. There may be other places on the internet that are appropriate for atheists and believers to debate their positions with, but this Community is primarily a place for cancer support and arguments detract from that. ",
