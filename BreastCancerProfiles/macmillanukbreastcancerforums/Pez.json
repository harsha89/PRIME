      "Content": "I was wondering how you were doing after your op. The anaesthetic can take a few days to work its way out of your system - I was dizzy and weepy for nearly a week after mine. Cocodamol is about the strongest painkiller you can buy over the counter (and can be taken in conjunction with ibuprofen too). If these don't work, speak to your GP and ask for something stronger. I made hubby sleep in the spare room for the first few nights so I could have the bed to myself and I used pillows to wedge myself into a comfortable(ish) position. I found lying on my back but with a pillow under the shoulder of my operation side was best for me but try to experiment a bit to find your best position. Rest as much as need to, make yourself a little nest on the sofa and get everyone to run around after you. My BCN told me to 'act like a man for a couple of weeks'!! And make sure that every time someone makes you a cuppa, it comes with a slice of cake! Lu xx",

      "Content": "Great post Intrepid! I started tamoxifen in October last year and now feel like an old lady. I visited my GP last week to see if anything could be done to help with the fatigue (I'm currently sleeping for around 9 hours at night and still needing a 2/3 hour sleep most afternoons!) and joint/muscle/ligament pain. Most days I am hobbling around in constant pain and I'm fed up with everyone asking me what I've done! My GP who is normally very wonderful and supportive totally poo poo'd the idea of it being anything to do with the tamoxifen and just said I was being too demanding of myself - is it too demanding to be able to walk without limping at 44 years old??? I am SURE it is the tamoxifen causing this pain. After researching several natural remedies, I have now spent a small fortune in Holland and Barrett and am taking so many supplements that I can barely fit any food in! - Turmeric, VitD, Evening Primrose oil and glucosamine. Too early to tell if they're helping but I'm willing to try anything. I've also started swimming every day as hoping this may help build up muscle strength. Lu x",

And by giving you certain drugs (tamoxifen being one of them), they can block your oestrogen and cut down on your chances of any secondaries or a recurrence. They should give you an oestrogen score out of 8, the higher your number, the more responsive to oestrogen your cancer was - mine was 8/8 so tamoxifen was a no brainer for me. Lu xx",

She was so poorly from the chemo and was a terrible patient after her op (always been a drama queen! But only I am allowed to say that as she's me bestie and I'd kill anyone who criticizes her!). Not having chemo, I have been able to cope physically much better than my friend did - I had less to go through. But the mental turmoil it has caused has been the same - only that bit doesn't 'show'. I hate being the centre of attention so I just quietly get on with things but then get upset when people don't realise what I'm going through (own worst enemy really!) Cancer is cancer, it is not a competition. Unless you have been through a diagnosis yourself, it can be hard to understand how it feels. Sending massive hugs xxx",

They should give you a mammogram (although these are not so reliable for younger women), a needle aspiration (biopsy using a very fine needle - sounds worse than it is!) and an ultrasound (ultrasounds are generally better than mammograms for younger women). Try and push for them all to be done at the same time - for some reason I was sent for all of mine individually and had to wait for the results of one before going for the next - this slowed the whole process down and ended up with me waiting months for a diagnosis.

Of course you are tired, your body, mind and soul are going through such turmoil. The ONLY thing you need to be worrying about at the moment is getting through the rest of your treatment, not whether you've done the shopping or decorated the lounge - none of that is as important as YOU. I am now 6 months past radiotherapy and just beginning to get a bit of my old zing back. It's been a rough ride and it has changed my life in so many ways - good and bad. I still have wobbly days (and possibly always will) but remember that it's OK to have wobbles. I worked all the way through my treatment (took a week off for my surgery), but reduced my hours and delegated a LOT! I found it gave me something to focus on as I have a tendency to brood if left alone for too long. You need to find ways to take your mind off it, whether that's through work, getting engrossed in a good book or meeting up with friends... whatever works for you. Have you looked through the publications on the main website at Macmillan and Breast Cancer Care? Most of them can be downloaded or sent out to you free of charge and they really are useful.

      "Content": "Hi All   Heather - I hope your reaction to the last dose of tax was not as bad as the others. Twintower - Glad the end is in sight for you, good luck with your last last cycle! Well, scrap my last post! The oncologist changed his mind again and decided to carry on with the Tax as the surgeon felt that even though the lump was not any smaller, it did feel softer so the tax was starting to do something. So she had her third cycle of tax last week. The rash is now all over her body, probably about 50-60% body coverage. She looks like she's been doused in acid. I can feel the heat coming off of her when I sit next to her and she swings from feeling boiling hot to having shivery goose bumps. Her skin is so sore all over that it hurts to move and it cracks and bleeds. She has to change her sheets every day as they are covered in blood when she gets up in the morning. She looks and feels totally wretched, it's so hard to know what to do or say to help. Her temperature is fine so they don't seem concerned as there is no infection. She has just been told that she just has to 'get on with it' and it will ease off in a week or so. I have been to all of her oncology appointments and chemo sessions with her and I am amazed at the lack of communication and basic human empathy from the oncology department, although the nurses on the ward are great. She was told by text message that she was due to start chemo, she's barely seen the same oncologist twice (and they all give conflicting advice), and they have never communicated with her dermatologist who is based at another hospital (despite saying that they would and then making clinical decisions about her treatment based on the condition of her skin!).   Sorry, I'm ranting but it all makes me so cross. I know they have hundreds, if not thousands of patients to deal with but she is a human being with a condition that needs treatment, not an emotionless lump of meat. She feels that she has never been 'involved' in her treatment, never given choices or made to feel that she has any options other than just to do what they say like a good little girl and be thankful. She is thankful (don't want to disparage the NHS - where would we be without it?), just fed up of being told what's happenning next by text message! Sorry, ranting again (I promise to calm down now...)   Pez",

She was supposed to have 4 FEC and then 4 Docetaxel but the Fec wasn't working after 2 cycles so they moved her straight on to Docetaxel.   About 2 weeks after her first Docetaxel, the skin started peeling off of her hands - she christened herself 'snake woman' as she looked just like a snake shedding its skin. When she went in for her second cycle, they said it was a reaction to the Docetaxel but didn't really seems interested as it wasn't sore or painful.She moisturised constantly but it was peeling again within minutes.   Since the second dose, the peeling has stopped but her hands and wrists are now bright red, hot and sore. They look and feel as if they've been badly sunburnt. She doesn't want to contact the hospital as she says they don't seem interested. She did try contacting her Breast Cancer Nurse last month about something else but they never got back to her! I was just wondering if anyone else had experienced this and if so, what did you do?   Thanks guys",

She did finally speak to one of the nurses who told her it was just the tax causing the rash and there was not really much they could suggest other than to keep it moisturised. It has stopped peeling now but just looks like tough red elephant skin - very attractive when you're already feeling self concious about a bald head, weight gain and severe psoriasis!   Having been taken off Fec as it was making no significant change, she has now been told that aftet two cycles of Tax they are dissapointed with the results. She is now being taken off chemo and moving straight onto surgery. She's really worried as she hasn't had the full course of chemo so is presuming that her risk of secondaries is probably higher now... But very relieved to have finished with the chemo and can now go back on her psoriasis meds to help clear her skin.   thanks again   Pez",

      "Content": "Hi Yvonne I am so sorry you have found yourself here but there is SO much help and support here. It is understandable that you are feeling lost, waiting for answers is so hard. If the doctor said the lump is cancerous then yes, he means cancer. Did he say this straight away or have your biopsy results come back already? In my experience a doctor will only say this before biopsy results if they are very confident of their diagnosis but having said that, there is always room for error and the only way to be certain is to wait for results - my mum was told she had a huge inoperable cancer in her stomach and probably had less than a week to live, turns out it was a stomach ulcer and was fine within a couple of months! And IF it is cancer, there are so many variations. When you go back next week, you should be given a more definitive answer, grade, size etc and options for treatment. The appointments with the surgeons can often feel a bit rushed so write any questions down on a piece of paper so you don't forget to ask them. Also, do you have someone to come with you as a second pair of ears is always a good thing? When I got my diagnosis, it was all explained quite briefly and a date booked in for surgery. Then they sent me away for a coffee and asked me to come back in half an hour when I sat down with a Breast Care Nurse (who was fantastic!) and asked loads more questions and was given a lot more information and support. You are bound to feel like you are spinning at the moment but once you get those concrete answers next week, you can formulate a plan and it will feel better. I know it's easier said than done but try not to let your mind run away with you. Sending love and hugs Lu xxx",

      "Content": "Hi Rebecca My son was diagnosed with depression when he was 15 so a little older than your bonus daughter (love that term!). He had always been a bit of a misfit at school and didn't seem to 'fit' with the other kids - he liked 'different' music to them, would rather play guitar than football and was a bit of an 'emo' (I hate that word). He found a group of like-minded friends eventually and if I'm honest, I think they encouraged each other to be depressed, it's almost like a badge of honour. He started self harming and not coming home - all of this happened within the space of a few weeks. He eventually had some kind of breakdown the day before his GCSE's were due to start and agreed to see a doctor. Our GP spoke to him for ages on his own then called me in. She referred him to CAMHS as an urgent referral but told me she wasn't allowed to prescribe anti-depressants to a child, it had to come from the CAMHS team. He was seen within a week and put straight onto prozac. I really hated the idea of it but was willing to try anything. He was also put into counselling once a week. We saw a slight improvement over the next few months and he came off the medication after 10 months. Immediately he went back downhill again so was put back on them at double the previous dose. He was having weekly CBT but we still seemed to be getting nowhere. In January, they doubled his dosage again and we are finally beginning to see a gradual change. The medication has given him the impetus and energy to take an active role in his CBT and begin to make some changes. It's been an awful two years for everyone as it has had such an impact on the whole family. My brother now barely speaks to me as he accused me of drugging him up for a quiet life! I still swing from feeling desperately sorry for my gorgeous boy and wanting to wring his neck - I still have moments where I wonder if all of this is an attempt to get away with exactly want he wants and he's playing us for fools. However, his psychiatrist and counsellor both assure me they can spot a faker a mile off... What I'm trying to say (in a very long winded way!) is that prozac CAN be a huge benefit, when used in conjunction with other therapies so don't rule it out. But I agree that it shouldn't be the first and only thing they offer and I would want her seen by an expert in child mental health before I went down this route. Lu xx",

From the day of my GP referral, nothing went the way I was told it would until the day of my diagnosis - the people I had seen on my journey were either ill informed of the process or very bad at explaining it. From what I've heard since, it seems common at our hospital and maybe this is the case with yours too. Will be keeping everything crossed for you on Friday but even if it is not the news you are hoping for, you WILL get through it Lucy xx",

It's natural to feel numb, terrified, depressed, detached.... these are all 'normal' responses to being told you have cancer. Hopefully once you have your surgery out of the way next week, you will start to feel better. I felt very numb to the whole thing when diagnosed but I was a gibbering wreck by time I went in for my WLE and quite honestly thought I was going to do a runner from the hospital before I went down the theatre - I even tried to get them to do it under a local as I was so scared of the anaesthetic! But it all went smoothly and once home, I felt my journey was really underway and I was on the road to recovery rather than the limboland that is 'waiting' It's not always easy to explain how you're feeling to people who haven't been through it but we are always here to chat to or rant to. There is no right or wrong way to get through this, you just do whatever you need to do. And when you get bored of chocolate, there is always cake! Lu xx",

The oncologist was more than happy to delay my radiotherapy for a week and it did me the world of good to go. We are going again in a couple of days time and I've still stuck with the annual policy we get with our bank account. They don't cover for breast cancer but in my mind, it has gone now so not an issue (although I may well be being slightly naive!) The cheapest insurance I found was through Eurotunnel - they cover for cancer, even terminal, as long as your GP would say you are fit to travel. No medical questions to answer so you don't need to spend hours expaining the ins and outs of it all. It is a fixed price for an annual policy (I think around £50 for Europe and £70 for worldwide) and they also do single trip policies. You have to do it over the phone as their website only copes with insurance booked with a Eurotunnel ticket. Enjoy your holiday, you deserve it! Lucy x",

I was diagnosed in July, WLE and sentinal node biopsy in Sept (lymphs clear) followed by radiotherapy in Oct/Nov and now tamoxifen. From the very beginning of this whole nightmare I have never showed anyone how scared I was, I have been happy, smiley, positive and it's been totally exhausting. I have children just slightly younger than yours (my 17 year old already suffers from severe depression and self harms) so I too, was trying to keep the whole situation as calm as possible for them. I have tried to talk to my husband about how I've been feeling and every time I try, he squirms and changes the subject - he really is an emotional cripple! I realise now that I should have been honest about how I was feeling right from the beginning, it would have made it easier to ask for help when I needed it. My advice to you would be to stop trying to be strong for everyone else - now is the time that they need to be strong for you. Lots of hugs xx",

      "Content": "Hi FelinesareFab (and they certainly are!) I am so sorry you are feeling so angry and low. It is the crappest of crappy things to be told you have cancer. The feelings and anger you are feeling now are perfectly natural and will have been felt by almost everybody who has had to hear the same news as you. Please don't think that no-one understands. People here will understand and will never judge. I have a husband and two teenage children, a mother living down the road and a father less than an hour away - but I have never felt more alone than in the last year. I have never been a 'forum' type person or the kind of person to go to local 'groups' but this forum and my local support group have been a life saver for me. My children are typical teenagers and the whole world revolves around their needs, my husband has the emotional capacity of a potato and we rarely talk any more and my mum and dad are elderly so I didn't want to burden them. I stuck my lippy on and played the part of 'Plucky Survivor coping wonderfully against adversity' with my friends and family telling me how 'inspirational' I was (how I HATE that saying, along with journey, survivor, fight and positive thinking!) - I didn't feel wonderful or inspirational, I felt angry, scared, repulsed and exhausted.. and I felt like I was living a lie. And I bet I'm not alone in that. All of those words seemed like pointless platitudes from people who didn't have a clue how I was feeling. But a year down the line, I am beginning to see the meaning of them. I am coming out the other side and am starting to accept that although my life will never be the same as it was before, I am finding and getting on with my new 'normal'. At the risk of blurting out another of those phrases that seemed ridiculous at the time - you WILL get through this, the treatment is all do-able. I had the same treatment as you - WLE with node biopsy, tamoxifen and then four weeks of radiotherapy. I went to all of my appointments alone, with the exception of surgery and only because I couldn't drive myself home! No, I am not 68 but if I can do it, so can you as you seem like a very strong woman (oh God! another of the hated phrases, I apologise!). Rant when you need to, eat chocolate when you need to, drink wine when you feel like it and do whatever it takes to get yourself through it. We'll all be here if and when you want us, to give practical tips and advice on treatment, side effects etc and an ear to listen. You never know, maybe this time next year, you'll be running a race dressed in a pink tutu with the word SURVIVOR embroidered in sequins across your fluffy pink bra! Lu x",

I think women are so good at 'coping' that it is assumed we are OK unless we admit otherwise. how many times do we answer \"Oh I'm fine\" when we are anything but? Tell your friends and family you need help, that you are struggling to cope alone. They're probably all wanting to help but not knowing the best way - this disease is hard for loved ones too. I kept my mouth shut all the way through my treatment and the resentment towards my family and friends grew and grew. Now my treatment is over and I am back to 'normal' it makes me laugh when I hear my mum or husband say \"oh she was a right trooper, never complained, just got her head down and got on with it\"... if only they knew how I was feeling at the time, they'd be horrified and upset. Tell them how you're feeling and ask for help. xx",

She would give me hugs, ask me if I needed anything and do little things to make me smile each day. As she was only 14 I did shield her from some of my darkest thoughts and feelings but was happy to talk about most things with her. It's a very scary time, not only for the person who has been diagnosed but also for those who love her. Talk to her and let her know how worried you are - she may well be keeping quiet in fear of scaring you but the reality is often not as bad as the fear. Both Macmillan and Breast Cancer Care websites have a huge range of leaflets that you can order free of charge or download, giving a wealth of information on every aspect of breast cancer, including support for families and carers of sufferers.
