      "Content": "Hi everyone it's the first time I have ever posted but I been reading and fiinding everything so helpful.  I hope I am doing this right! I had 2 tumours - 1 lobular and 1 tubular removed with WLE on Sept 29. They were both ER positive so I am taking Letrozole.  I started radiotherapy this last week and have had 3 treatments out of a total of 20 (15 +5 booster as the margin wasn't quite clear.) There was no lymph node involvement. I went to a physio class a few weeks ago and we were told very clearly not to use anti perspirant ever again on the affected armpit as it blocks the pores.  We were shown various examples of deoderant.  One of these is a crystal block /stick (also comes as a spray).  I was dubious that it could work but it is excellent and completely effective in spite of its dreadful name - Pit Rock!! I asked at my first radio appt if it was suitable to use during radiotherapy and was told yes it's fine, as it doesn't contain any alluminium, which can accelerate the radiotherapy waves. I wish everyone well Posy    ",

      "Content": "Hi Karen   I am about half way through my radiotherapy. I don\u2019t know if you will be able to work as it would perhaps depend on how tiring your job is.  From my experience the first treatments produced very little side effects.  Now after 10 I am getting quite tired especially after lunch.  Not everyone has any side effects at all.   Perhaps you could aim to work initially and then slow down if necessary? I would contact the radiotherapy dept well beforehand if this is your plan and ask for your treatments to be planned for first thing in the morning for a couple of reasons.  Firstly, there is less chance of a delay in your appointment as there hasn\u2019t been time for a backlog to build. You may also find it easier to park.  We are given a parking permit for the duration of the treatment which waives the charges and also allows you to use the disabled bays. My oncologist suggested I have someone to take me as this means you can go straight in while your husband (in  my case) finds a parking place. Very good advice.   There is excellent information in the Macmillan booklet/online about breast radiotherapy.   I hope it all goes really smoothly for you whatever you decide   Best wishes Posy",

      "Content": "Hi Joan http://www.pitrok.co.uk/ http://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=pit+rok It really is a dreadful name for a deodorant isn't it? I bought mine from Amazon with free delivery for £5.36. cheaper than going into town and paying car parking! It is in Boots too right down on the bottom shelf in our store.  There are other makes too I believe but I haven't seen any locally. Although it seems very expensive, looking at the way this stick is going down there hardly seems to be any change in it at all so I guess it will last for a very long time. Yes I am getting the hot flushes with the Letrozole. They were really fierce for the first two/three weeks but are settling down a bit now.  I get them both day and night too. It's all a bit challenging in the wardrobe dept now it's so cold outside! Take care Posy",
