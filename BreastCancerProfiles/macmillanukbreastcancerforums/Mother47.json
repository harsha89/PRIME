I take heart that if its not the main ones the mutation isn't showing up regularly as a recurrence ! So they took blood asked all the medical and family history again and I wait ,but anything that can forward the cancer cure is worth a bit of blood ! So in layman terms ,they pull apart the DNA to extremes to find mutation which can take a while .",

Steroids for 3 days and injections ( very small needle) for 5 days ,better at night time as can make you ache . Was told to have last steroids before 4pm as they can keep you awake. I only had very slight finger pain,for two days at most and not uncomfortable just found opening packets a challenge. My mouth was sore but no more than with FEC. The big difference for me was the way it is given, FEC they put in by hand and T is done by drip and very boring!! By day 5/6 I was back on school run and cycle 2 was much earlier . Have a good meal before hand and drink loads and the fact you will be on no4 makes everything better over half way :)))) Wish you well ladies xx",

I would think they will just talk to you and arrange tests later on ,nothing they do is worse than biopsies really. The test are to make sure your care is taylor made for you They will want to find out what type ,where and why your cancer has appeared . Treatments are as varied as the lumps , it doesn't follow that everyone has chemo or mastectomy s . I was totally unaware before this ,what a fantastic science oncology is and how much is available to cure you .
