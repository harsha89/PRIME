    "Content": "Hi Jan, all the best with your treatment, I hope it goes well for you.   I had one lump removed on 22 October.  I will be having radiotherapy in the new year.  All the waiting between appt's is hard, for me.  I will probably opt for the 3 weeks treatment.  I was offered to take part in a trial, where they decide on which group I'd go in. Either standard radiotherapy, which could be the standard 3 weeks treatment, or the option of either of two other  5 days treatment of radiotherapy, one less radiotherapy, it seems, and the other higher dose of r/t.  I hate having to make a decision!  We only want the best for our bodies, don't we?   Like you, I will use Letrozole, after my radiotherapy.  I just want treatment to start!  I'm to have my Planning appt at Oncology, in a couple of weeks. I had my first appt at Oncology yesterday, where a lot of information was given  It can numb the brain at times!  It's good you've had some radiotherapy quite soon.  I'm not good at waiting!    Anyway, would be lovely to chat with you, Jan.  All the best to you.  Ruby. ",
