Did say it would improve with time and have to say it has but it is still very bad. If having a pic cline for short amount of time prevents this happening to you I would take it. Good luck x x",

      "Content": "Hi Kelly - I know what you mean - I am 37 and have a 21 month and I certainly didnt think I would be in this situation. However, once you get your head around things it becomes easier (or at least has for me). I was diagnosed in April with 3 cm tumor. I have just had my second lot of chemo (they are doing chemo before surgery with me). Have to say - I was expecting it to be a total nightmare but it wasnt. It was rough for the 2 days after but after that I felt pretty normal (if I ever was to start with). For me, I used to get emotional when I used to watch my daughter play befroe I was dignosed but since its been weird and the opposite. She is actually helping me in fighting this crap - she makes me laugh god knows how many times a day and I know it is a cliche but laughter can be the best medicine. Got to go for now as my hour peace where she has had a nap is over. Stay strong and keep smiling and laughing - it does help honestly (even when you dont feel like it). Speak soon, Del",

      "Content": "This thread has given me a giggle this morning.  I have had some classic stuff said over the last twelve months and my face has been a picture. Dentist told me that \"chemo really hasnt dont you any favours has it\" and when told well it actually played it a big part in saving my life he kindly told me \"oooo never thought of it that way before\"  duhhh My husband at the time (divorced after finished my treatment as promised myself anything or anyone that doesnt make me happy is going) told me when he came home from work one day and I was hanging off the sink exhausted after running around after a 2yr old turned to me and said why you like that you only get chemo once every three weeks. My so called best friend told me how lucky I was not to have periods, which still ahvent come back so the chances of me having anymore children are virtually zero Del xx",

      "Content": "Morning Caz, I am exactly the same. it has almost been 2 yrs since I was diagnosed and I finished all the treatment jan last yr. I am constantly exhausted and have to drag myself around most days trying to look after my 3yr old. I have been back to drs and he told me that side effects from treatment can last up to two years after treatment finishes. Also for me I dealt with the whole cancer in what I can describe as flippant as that was my way of handling it all that I had to play the seriousness down big time. Dr reckons tbat this has now created post traumatic stress. Went to see consultant last week for my mammo etc.....thankfully given all clear and I explained to him and he told me that due to my age (turned 40 last month) and as my periods have not come back maybe tamoxifen is not the right treatment. He has told me to see how I go in the next few months and might change the meds.....dont know if you are in similar position. Hope you have a good day Del x x xx",
