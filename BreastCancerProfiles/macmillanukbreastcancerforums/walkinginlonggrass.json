      "Content": "Dear Skye i feel so sad and angry that your family are unable to look outside their lives and problems to give you the support that you need right now.  I dont understand it but i have experienced it too and the only way i could deal with it was to accept that they cannot be there as you have done.  i have found that friends and people who i dont know very well who i would never have expected have given me huge support and sometimes strangers and i am sure that these angels will come your way.   I dont know where you live but if you do need help and it does not materialise please post it and if i can i will help.  it sounds like you are a strong woman and this is a challenge which will make you stronger.  We cant chose our family but we can chose our friends and surround ourselves by those that love and nurture and empower us. xLucy",

      "Content": "Dear Skye01, i wanted to respond as this resonates enormously with me.  i hear that your family cannot support you in the way that you need right now and that you are angry and wanting to withdraw which is a natural response.  on the positive side everyone is willing to get together on Thursday and you may find it helpful to focus on what outcome you would like from this and ask for and visualise it every day.  it may be hard but focussing on the positive will i believe introduce that energy into the dynamic.  maybe you could ask everyone to really think about what they can realistically do to help and support you before thursday and cut the excuses - we are all responsible for and chose our actions and priorities.  it may not be what you want but at least you will know exactly where you stand and can then look elsewhere for your needs to be met. i dont know if my experience is of any help - i found it really hard to ask for help and expected my family and friends to have empathy, understand and just step in.  like you i felt angry and resentful and thought why should i have to lay it all out for them so i just got on with it which was a real struggle as i am single and self-employed and had a dog but no children.  with the benefit of time i can see that i was unclear and needed to forgive them for what they were unable to provide.  now i am trying to ask clearly for what i need and trust that it will be provided from somewhere.  to give you an example i asked my ex-partner to come with me to the vet when i thought i was going to have to our dog to sleep from chest cancer and he chose not to come.  the husband of a friend of mine came to support me as she could not physically get to me, the person i would have least expected to help me did.  interesting eh.  trust. with love",
