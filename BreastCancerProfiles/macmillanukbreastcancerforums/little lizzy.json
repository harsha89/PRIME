      "Content": "Hi everyone, I'm just wondering what kind of surgery you've had for your lumpectomys. I had a benign lump (lipoma) removed many years ago and I could never see where the scar was, it was so discreet. On line it's possible to find images of simple scars that were the result of cancer lumpectomies.  After my diagnosis I had my lumpectomy which involved an incision wound the whole way across at the base of my breast, a vertical one up to my nipple, the nipple removed and sewn back in a different place. I'm grateful that my operation happened of course, and I was lucky enough not to need a mastectomy (as yet). The whole procedure was carried out a second time because not enough margin was taken. Did anyone else get this quite extensive cutting for their lumpectomy?  The surgeon sewed my nipple back where he saw fit but now it's much higher than the other and seems to want to poke out of the top of my bra. My nipple wasn't involved in the cancer and my lump was the lateral side of my left breast and approximately 2cm in diameter. I think of it as my lumpectomy with collateral mutilaion and wonder if I'm being dramatic or if most people's surgery was performed in a different way.  Part of my nipple was also lost in the procedure and I now have what seems like a lob sided eye peering up at me. It's obviously been cut away on one edge so there's no getting it back.  A smile to all you beautiful women xxxx",

I seriously have no idea why he did what he did at all. It's as if he decided to expose the whole of my mammary tissue for some reason, which isn't necessary with all the scanning techniques etc. It wouldn't be so bad but the left nipple is about two inches higher than the right. I have a pad in my bra to make my boobs look equal size but I have to watch what I wear because the left nipple keeps crawling out of my bra at the top. If everything goes well I'm considering seeing a plastic surgeon for reconstruction, if I can afford it that is. I expect it's very expensive. I daren't let the general surgeon do any more than he has to or I might find a huge boil on my chin one day! Lol. XXX",

Most of our problems are serious to us and the slightest worry can feel enormous. This is not a serious problem, but losing my hair disturbed me a lot. There's a lighter side to it though, which actually makes me laugh now and it's my wig who deserves the title 'my dead rat'. When I think of the embarrassing times I've had with it, I can't help but laugh, like when I first wore it and was sitting down and looked up to the person shaking my hand to say hello. The angle of my head was such that my wig slid up the back of my head a good inch. The person looking at me didn't look me in the eye, but couldn't take his eyes off the top of my head. He'd obviously seen the bloody rat move to leave me looking like an egg head. I was wondering if anyone else had a wig story or two.",

I'm not planning on having my problem long term, but who knows?? I hope your other half gets sorted out promptly and well, but with your sense of humour I'm sure your darling will be positive if you can help it at all! Don't worry about what you write on here and whether or not it's appropriate. Apart from the odd person that might think such subjects are flippant, most people are as sound as the proverbial pound and are truly lovely. If someone is not 'lovely', I just like to believe they're having a bad time and it's resulting in a bit of scorn. Seriously, there are so many beautiful contributors to these pages, they are all very inspirational.  I have some epic stories about my dead rat ( who I don't think is entirely deceased sometimes). I was desperate for hair once I shaved off my own at the start of FEC treatment and I started to shed. I went to buy one and the first place I visited was a wig shop that doubled as a hairdressing salon. The only mortal beings in there were the owner, and an old woman eating a sandwich (and not having her hair done) and a yapping little dog. To be continued!",

The woman wouldn't take anything but cash and the only time I saw her smile was when she was counting the money! Her hair looked like a German Shepards arse so I think I should have realised, but I was in a bad place. I Didn't wear the wig for ages and stayed in my cave because I was too embarrassed to go out; what an idiot I was. When i did go out I was fearful that it would ride up again so I ordered some 'wig glue' online. I glued my wig to the front and back of my head and the next day I couldn't get rid of the glue. Actually it was stuck to my skin for a week! I was peeling it off along with chunks of skin, a bit at a time. I then ordered some double sided sticky strips. Ok, maybe I said I had no hair, but in reality I had some fluffy bits. The strips held my dead rat in place for a good night out but when I came to take it off it 'waxed' away every fibre hair or fluff or I had remaining, consequently I didn't use the strips again, or the bloody glue!. I've eventually learned to live with my little rat but have had to snip it at both sides above the ears because it was actually too small and quite often decided to go for a rat zombie walk now and again and it felt like my head was in a vice! Bloody piece of shit that it is.I also had to cut bits off to make it look 'normal' around my face. My hair is growing very slowly but I WILL have a ceremony when I no longer need my little dead rat!!",

I\u2019ve been a nurse all my life and I think it\u2019s an an attack of streptococcal bacteria which is common in noses (what a weird but annoying subject this is). I bought some chloramphenicol eye ointment and used it on the sores around my right nostril. It seems to be working well but it\u2019s hard to apply when the mucus membranes inside the nose can be so wet. If you can put chloramphenicol in your eyes, I don\u2019t see any reason not to use it in a nostril. It\u2019s an antibiotic that\u2019s not used systemically as it causes all sorts of problems, but for minor external treatments it\u2019s acceptable. I know a surgeon who always prescribes it to put on wounds after surgery to prevent infection.  Vaseline sounds effective though, probably because it restricts the spread and confines it to one area. Also immunity is suppressed while on chemo so any bug can get a grip at times. I may look like Rudolph now but I won\u2019t be leading the reindeer as it\u2019s going away quickly. ❤️❤️❤️",

      "Content": "Dear friends every single one of you  Most people looking at and/or have contributed to this site, have been through the same shit, and we all know how terrible we've felt at times. We all know the horrors of chemo, hair loss, taste changes etc. Lets face it, it's a most dreadful and horrendous experience that we can't properly relate to ourselves let alone one another. However similar our trials have been, we each live within our own bodies and only we as individuals experience our separate lonely ride. If anyone thinks I'm being dramatic then they either haven't gone through it or have had a relatively easy ride. What I want to share with all you beautiful ladies is the most positive thing that has happened to me in many months. It's only tiny in the face of the whole picture but I'm serious when I say it's shifted my mood from the bad extreme to the best extreme. I'm joyful today. My eyelashes started to appear as little black dots after finishing FEC and starting taxotere. I still wouldn't go out because I couldn't wear makeup because of streaming eyes all of the time. I looked like a bloody alien. I finished taxotere and  still the  eyes were running for ages, I thought it would never end. Six weeks ago I finished the poison from hell and although I've had bad side effects from herceptin since, my eyes stopped running about a week ago. I was able to wear 'smoky eyes' eyeliner that disguised my lack of lashes to the most part. I'm now ecstatic to report that my eyelashes and brows are coming back  thick and fast to the point that they are annoying me because they get in the way of my eyeliner brush! I can't believe it and am totally thrilled. I've been taking Biotin and Solgar 'skin, nails and hair' supplements (all approved by oncs). My hair is also coming back nicely and my nails are stronger than they've ever been!! One small step for one woman, one great step for breast cancer sufferers!!! High as a bloody kite, even if it only lasts a day or two, its so lovely!!!! Love to all Lizzy. XXX",

Before you lose your lashes you don't realise there's a small 'ledge' left where they used to grow, not a thin straight guiding line. I ended up with glue all over my face, one eye wide open and the other half shut, I bet I looked more like a freak than I thought at the time because I was determined to go out with them on. Needless to say my weepy eyes soon washed the glue off and each eyelash was still fixed at one corner but the rest was flapping around until someone kindly told me about them. I had to whip them off quickly and was so embarrassed. Now I think it's hilarious though, but I'll never forget it. XXX",

The neck and back hair is weird but i don't know how hairy you were before. LOL. Obviously you need the help of a trained professional muscular young man to assist you with the areas you can't quite reach!! The mascara sounds great if it lengthens lashes shorter lashes. I've written it down for when mascara is even possible for me. Should be soon!!!  I have to take herceptin until next March and the side effects resemble those of taxotere to me, but without the taste changes. the positive is that they seem to disappear after about five days. My next  is Wednesday. For the past two days I've felt really good and don't want herceptin again to change my mood, but it's going to be a long haul and I have to get used it to accept it. I'm not so worried about radio because I think after Taxotere I could eat rat poison with a smile. Thanks so much for your lovely correspondence.

One lady said she had it but it disappeared after a while so good luck. I am to have Herceptin every three weeks until next March followed by five years of daily tablets - not quite sure which one they will give me yet. I think I accept the side effects because because I have no choice, but I'm a right moaning cow when I get them. I'll be starting 33 sessions of radiotherapy soon so my winging will probably intensify. Lol. Yes this site is brilliant and everyone feels like a friend because we have a bond even though we've never met. I love it. Please let me know how you feel when you've had your hair done. I bet you'll love it Lots of love and hugs, Lizzy. XXXX Let",

When I wear it I'm sure it's not quite all that dead after all because it creeps up the back at times and I'm sure it has little legs with sharp toe nails. I live next to a river and have made a solemn vow! As soon as I'm comfortable with the look of my hair, the little dead rat will be set adrift on a raft on the river with it's little funeral pyre blazing atop, and fireworks sending it on it's way. Maybe a glass of the fantastic local champagne equivalent, (it's called Blanquette), with my friends. I mean it, it will happen!!  The Annie Lennox look sounds great.

I'm just using a cheap eyebrow kit. I bought more expensive ones but find the Rimmel one is the best. It comes with a tiny angled brush that makes the perfect shape. My eyebrows actually look close to real with it and it stays on very well. You may not become a bearded lady because I haven't. It sounds like we'd have too much competition in the freak show anyway because the show has already commenced with the other ladies taking starring roles, only on limited contract though! We have our own unique roles in our own freaky ways. What an experience for us all eh?

I too had Herceptin with the taxotere and blamed all the side effects on Taxotere simply because people were saying Herceptin is much easier to cope with. It's me, I'm born to moan so I'm granted plenty of reasons to do so. Even for me though, the Herceptin side effects last for a number of days and then disappear so I's not so bad. It's just a nuisance when I've just started to get my mojo back though. I'm about to have another lot on Wednesday and I'm waiting to see how I feel afterwards.

The river Aude rises a bit in the winter but isn't very deep as it runs through my little town, Limoux. Apparently there used to be constant flooding and my house used to get it , but since they built a new dam in the Pyrenees it hasn't happened although it's best not to be too complacent I suppose. The old flood warning systems are still up around town and there's a loud speaker on the corner opposite. The system is mainly used to broadcast carols at Christmas now. The bike ride was lovely and I intend to do one as often as possible. Mind you, after 6 months of inertia I'm bloody well aching this morning.

I\u2019ve been taking tamoxifen for a couple of weeks and I\u2019m not liking it! I get hot flushes, headache and insomnia. The worst thing I\u2019ve noticed is that about half an hour after taking it I begin to get anxiety that gets worse and worse during the day. Someone mentioned FEAR. Is that what you\u2019re getting as well? It becomes overwhelming and debilitating.  Yes, we all know what we\u2019ve been through and what could happen to us. Chemo, radio and the maintenance drugs can all cause another cancer! It seems like Russian roulette for all of us. I\u2019m seeing GP on Thursday and might ask for venaflexine. I take diazepam and have reduced it from 30mg a day to just 5mg now and really don\u2019t want to up the dose again for my anxiety. It\u2019s great as a temporary fix for anxiety but coming off it is a nightmare I\u2019d rather not take antidepressants as you say Papplewick because I\u2019m alread taking more tablets than I want to including co-codamol and ibuprofen for my joints, but if I need it I might try it.  What a game this all is! It seems we have to play it and don\u2019t have a choice but I understand anyone deciding not to take maintenance drugs. 10 bloody years of this? That one fatal day when were all diagnosed and the wheel of events following that. My goodness, what a life changing day that was! ❤️❤️❤️",

Feel desperateand once again (after Letrozole) feel like I\u2019m 100 years old. Do the side effects calm down after a while.

The hot flushes and night sweats seem to be lessened since I started taking it in the morning instead of at night. Tryptophan, I\u2019m not offended at all but quite flattered. I do a lot of writing just for myself anyway, it helps me offload. I might look in to your suggestion. ❤️❤️❤️",

I\u2019ll continue with tamoxifen and hope the doctor will give me the venaflexine as the hot flushes are horrible. Thanks for your help. ❤️❤️",

      "Content": "Dear jojo4. I was diagnosed over 2 years ago and went through the usual lot. I thought I was hating every minute of my treatment but at least it gave me a purpose and appointments to keep. It was when the treatment stopped and I was just put on maintenance meds that I felt I had fallen of a cliff edge. I sank into depression with anxiety as well and have been struggling up and down since then. You have given me hope that maybe soon I\u2019ll find a purpose, like going back to work or doing something else meaningful. Thank you. ❤️❤️❤️",

Mine is, and although it's only about 2cm long now, I've had to touch up my roots twice with colour LOL. It's now my personal joke, \"my roots need doing\" LOL. All the best for your pink hair.
