    "Content": "Hello I wonder if you could help...I am a BRCA2 carrier and four years ago had a prophylactic bilateral mastectomy and immediate reconstruction using LD flaps. There are forums and support groups regarding women who have been through similar to the above. However extremely sadly and rarely (1%) I developed Grade 3 breast cancer with lymph node invasion a year ago and have since had my right breast deconstructed and removed altogether, six cycles of chemotherapy, 15 sessions of radiotherapy and am about to go on a 1-year trial drug.   I feel very isolated about my situation because I do not know anyone else in my situation.  Up until a year ago I could celebrate with BRCA carrier women who had bravely undergone prophylactic mastectomy to avoid or decrease the development of breast cancer, but now I do not have anyone to share my story with and relate to because I think it is extremely rare. Do you know how I could find other women (support groups) in my situation? With many thanks.",
