I\u2019ve decided on Diep flap reconstruction which should be on 12 th March . At first it was lumpectomy but then the satellite nodule appeared as a triple negative and now am awaiting information re if I need chemo etc. having the biopsy on Saturday has made me realise it\u2019s all really happening I suppose... and the whole medical team have been lovely but twice now I\u2019ve rung my nurse and she hasn\u2019t got back to me ... I imagine poor woman is rushed off her feet with bigger questions than mine. thank you for replying it does help me to read your comments thank you ",

I\u2019m not sure re my dressings etc and I can\u2019t seem to get a reply from the nurse I was meant to ring .  Thank you so much for taking the time to reassure me I do feel rather self indulgent in my moaning on here please forgive that it\u2019s not meant to be . I really appreciate you taking the time to comment thanks you ",

      "Content": "Hi I know I\u2019m being ungrateful as I have a lovely family all looking after me. Some friends have deserted me but others have come up trumps. however despite all the support I feel terribly lonely as I await my Diep flap op and the results of  my lymph node biopsy. Mainly because despite their kindness I feel no one around me knows how I feel! does anyone else feel like the? also I was diagnosed at the start of December but diagnosis changed and it\u2019s all very frustrating not knowing if it\u2019s just a mastectomy or any other treatment. sorry I\u2019m feeling very low and thought maybe someone could say they felt low but it\u2019s ok. I have four teenagers who need my emotional support and a worried husband so  the brave face at home . thanks for listening x",
