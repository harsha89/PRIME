      "Content": "Hi If you are in a union contact them to support you  Phone the Macmillan line they will help you  You are being treated unfairly  People with cancer even if cured are disabled and as such have protected rights  They are discriminating against you because you are disabled which is illegal  Keep a diary  If you want to stay there you need to raise a grievance with hr detailing all the   Points , if the grievance isn't dealt with you can take them to a tribunal for disability discrimination  After all you've been through is it worth staying there ? I wouldn't  Aim to get a payout of them and move on  Good luck xx",
