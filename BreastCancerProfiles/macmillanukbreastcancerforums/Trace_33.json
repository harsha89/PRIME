      "Content": "Hi mama fighter, i have coped quite well with the weekly paclitaxol so far but each time I\u2019ve had the carboplatin (3 weekly), it has wiped me out for a good few days with nausea, loss of appetite & fatigue, I literally slept for nearly a whole weekend with my last dose, thank god my kids are teenagers as don\u2019t know how people cope with little ones it must be so hard. All I can say is if you need to sleep then sleep if you can! In the first few weeks had a lot of nausea but was only actually sick once & had a few bad headaches but these seem to have disappeared. I\u2019ve had a little bit of tingling in my fingers after paclitaxol lately but only seems to last a couple of days. i hope you don\u2019t feel too bad with the treatment, I just keep in my mind that another one is ticked off each time & another step closer to the end of chemo!  Take care sending positive vibes xxx ",

      "Content": "Hi script fan, thanks for the reply, I pretty much feel that way when I have the carboplatin every 3 weeks - loss of appetite, nausea & also fatigue, & the most awful metallic taste in my mouth! Only lasted a few days on last cycle so hopefully be the same this time ( just had it Monday & feeling rubbish this evening!)  not had heartburn but terrible constipation on the week of carbo as they give you ondansetron anti sickness with it & it\u2019s one of the side effects of that, oh the joys of chemo!!  Have you finished your chemo now then? Hope it is all going well for you xx",

      "Content": "Hi, have been receiving pac/carbo chemo for 7 weeks now & have 5 weeks left of this then am due to start EC chemo on Xmas eve, (merry Xmas me!), was just wondering if any others have had their treatment this way & how the EC compares to the pac/carbo chemo? I have coped quite well the weekly paclitaxol so far, although do find the carboplatin every 3 weeks knocks me out a bit, I wonder if the EC has the same sort of effect as it is another 3 weekly one?",

I\u2019ve been using the cold cap which has worked so far but then my eyebrows are still here too & thought they\u2019d be long gone by now! Good luck with your mri results (playing the waiting game again!), you\u2019re onto the next stage so another step closer to recovery xx ",
