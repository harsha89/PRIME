    "Content": "Hello Karen, Thank you so very much for your post. I also started to panic and thought I'd be regretting all of the times I said: \"chemo has been so easy!\" I am on EC and doing really well on it and hoping that I will also be able to go through my 4 T sessions without too many problems. Thank you, you gave me some much needed hope and perspective. Sabrina",
