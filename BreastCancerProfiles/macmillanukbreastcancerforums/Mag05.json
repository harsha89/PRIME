    "Content": "Hi. Can any tell me of local support groups. I no longer have cancer. But my implant was ruptured during op. I've waited nearly four years for op to remove and recontruct. Â A week before my op I was told no funds to reconstruct. So they took both 11 weeks ago.Leaving a mess. I'm now being told they should have reconstructed the one and left other. My heads shot. If any one can help. Thank you",
