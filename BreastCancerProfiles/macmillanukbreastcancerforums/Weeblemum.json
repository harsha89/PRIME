      "Content": "I too got through my FEC treatment pretty well apart from a few 'lost' days of chemo fatigue - no nausea/sickness, and I found the hair loss quite liberating - had a headscarf for every occasion! I had allergic reaction to the docetaxol so was put on Abraxane instead - had some peripheral neuropathy so had to reduce the dosage for the last one, but no real joint pain etc. Radiotherapy (25 sessions) was tiring, largely due to the travel and waiting about, but I had no side effects from that either.  I was lucky enough to be signed off sick for the whole of my treatment as I work with children, and the oncologist was not happy with the likelihood of coming down with bugs. I did, however, keep on with my social life - mainly going to the theatre. I managed to avoid any infections during treatment.  I had no real side effects from 3.5 years of Tamoxifen apart from hot flushes, but these may have been due to the fact that chemo sent me into menopause anyway! Unfortunately, it didn't do its job...  I'm now on Capecitaibine oral chemo for secondaries in lungs and denosumab for bone mets. The capecitabine is very manageable - I've had some problems with hand/foot syndrome and fatigue but these are both variable. I'm off work again, but have been able to run up and down the country to redecorate my Mum's house and look after her after she had a stroke in September. I'm still going to the theatre  - again, no infections as yet (touch wood). No side effects from the denosumab.  I realise that I have been lucky with the side effects and that not everyone is the same, but it's not always awful, and there can be bonuses - when my hair grew back, it was darker, thicker and more curly than it was before and has remained much 'better' than my previous fine , mousy mess... :-)  Best wishes to everyone going through the process of banishing the beast Cathy",

      "Content": "Hi MooCoo Hope you don't mind me butting in, but please ask your oncologist about any type of supplement before you take it as some really don't mix with the different chemos! It's very tempting to take things once you've researched them yourself or to take other peoples' advice on what they've taken, but it is always worth just checking in case! I have really bad cramps on my chemo and people recommended quinine (my magnesium and potassium levels are normal) to help. Seemed like a good idea, but as I had a close appointment with my oncologist, I thought I'd check with him first. Turns out that quinine and Erubulin are a complete no-no together as it can cause major heart issues and heart attacks... we decided that I would live with the cramps!!!!  Best of luck with your second dose today! ",

      "Content": "Hi concepta  Firstly, good luck with your first chemo today - hoping that the side effects will be minimal for you (but still no washing the motor home even if they are!) I think that in some ways, a cancer diagnosis is as bad for partners and other members of the family as for the person themselves - I think it stems from helplessness to a certain extent - we are the ones going through the treatments to help ourselves, but for others, all they can do is watch and see us 'suffer'. It sounds like your husband is almost in denial that you are ill and is therefore trying to keep life as normal as possible for himself. As life isn't the same for you, it means that he isn't in the same place as you are at the moment! I think that a lot of men have difficulty acknowledging things that scare them!  He might not be able to talk to you about the cancer, but could one of your daughters or your son try to engage him about his feelings? He may feel that he doesn't want to burden you with his feeling whilst you are having to cope with things. I'm sure that Macmillan have support for carers if he wanted to access it, or possibly via the GP. However, that would mean that he is having to accept that he is struggling, which may be an issue.  It might be that once you've had the first chemo and he sees any side effects, he will have to face the issue head on more than he has at the moment. I would say DON'T try to minimise how you are feeling over the next few days - if you feel like rubbish, then he will have to cope more for himself and acknowledge that you are not well enough to do the things he wants to do!  I'm sure he's not being deliberately thoughtless - it's just his way of coping - not easy for you though. Here's a hug for you (and him!) and again, good luck for today! ",

If you have a breast care nurse, they are often good listeners and may be able to help you with accessing support.  Good luck, and hope your anxieties ease as much as possible as soon as possible Hugs to you",

They didn't do a full clearance as they didn't think it was necessary. They couldn't locate very many nodes anyway - I seemed to have a lack of them!  Mastectomy was followed by FEC-T, 25 fractions of radiotherapy and 3.5 years of tamoxifen. They were as sure as possible that I would be clear and the chemo and radiotherapy were really seen as belt and braces treatments to make sure everything was clear. In June, I was diagnosed with secondary BC in lungs and bones (and also in my heart tissue), so you never can tell! I'm not sure that a full clearance in 2013 would have helped, but it's too late to worry about that now!!! ",

As for the bone scan - I find them to be one of the more relaxing scans - you have a radioactive isotope injected into a small cannula and then you have to wait for 3 hours for the scan so that the isotope can migrate to the bones. The scan itself is slow - about 30 minutes -  but silent and not enclosed - I usually have a nap!  Bone activity shows up as black areas on the scan - not all areas shown are necessarily mets as bone activity from other causes also shows up e.g. I have a degenerating lumbar vertebra which is not cancer based but still shows up!  I have 4 weekly bone strengthening injections (along with vitamin D and calcium tablets) , which for me don't have any side effects, and I was told last week that the multiple bone mets I have in spine, ribs, hips, clavicles and sternum actually look better than they did on the last scan ( I'm also on chemo for lung mets).  Other people have different types of drugs for their bone mets.  It's a frightening time between diagnosis and having a 'plan', and reading up on the internet often doesn't help as you can get worst case scenario articles or reports.  Hope the scan goes well and that you get a plan from the oncologists very quickly.  Best wishes Cathy",

      "Content": "Hi MollyRiver!  I'm now due to have a blast of radiotherapy on the rib mets to reduce the pain, but if that doesn't work, I'll ask about the possibllity of removing the other boob - I'd be quite happy being flat both sides!  My original diagnosis was Grade 2 ductal carcinoma - 5 cm ER positive, HER negative. There was also extensive DCIS. I didn't have an axilliary node clearance as only 1 sentinal node of four had a micromet and the other four they took were clear, so they didn't think it was necessary!  Was rediagnosed with Stage 4 in lungs and bones in June 2017 after having a dry cough and breathlessness for almost 8 months.  At the moment, chemo is being delayed due to hand/foot syndrome, and may be swapped to another drug if they don't get better in the next couple of weeks.  The Capecitabine chemo is oral - you take tablets twice a day for 14 days and then have 7 days off, then start again! Although the oral chemo is easier than finding a vein every three weeks, the daily intake and then only 7 days off means that the side effects can be permanent rather than peaking then getting better before the next cycle. The plan was that this would be a permanent thing until it stopped working, but the toxicity has got me first and because I've had over a cycle off now, my oncologist will have to reapply to the NHS for me to go back on it. If they refuse, it'll be back to IV chemo  - Vinorelbine. The chemo is largely for the lungs. The bone mets - they keep them stable with monthly injections of denosumab, which is an antibody, plus calcium supplements. Pain is often dealt with via radiotherapy and some people need surgery if they suffer fractures to stabilise things. Luckily, I haven't got to that stage yet!  Best wishes, and I hope everyone gets the results that they want from surgery consultations! Cathy",

I had longer period of radiotherapy (same total dosage but over longer time so didn't have so much effect on the skin/tissue) in case I wanted to reconsider reconstruction. Up until recently, the lopsidedness hasn't bothered me (or my OH), but now I have secondary bone mets in ribs, just where the bottom of my bra comes and it's quite painful to wear a bra! I'm quite well endowed so it's difficult to find clothes that I can go out in that don't show up that I'm not wearing my prosthesis! I'd now quite like to have the other breast removed so I don't have to worry about it, but not sure that they'd consider it, especially as I've had a recent mammogram  at the yearly check-up that shows that breast is clear!  When I told the oncologist I was going for the mammogram, he kindly said that given the circumstances (I also have lung mets and am on permanent chemo), the breast screens were entirely optional! I know what he meant, but I went anyway as I was sort of hoping that they'd find something that I could argue for removal...

The lump in your armpit may just be a swollen lymph gland  - have you been fighting any infections lately? There are many reasons for lumps and bumps, and most of them will be nothing to worry about.  The most important thing is to get it checked out by the GP - hopefully they will be able to put your mind and rest. Try not to Google symptoms as you can often get misleading information that will, understandably, worry you! If you DO feel it necessary to look, then stick to sites like this one and Cancer Research UK.

I had a wig, but it was hot and itchy and didn't look like me, even though it was a good wig! I then made the decision to go bald when it was hot to save a sweaty head - people looked briefly, but didn't really take any notice and when my hair started to grow back, people said that the pixie type 'cut' suited me, so it was all good!  I actually found being bald quite liberating - saved a lot of time getting ready for things and in hair products and I found I actually have quite a good shaped head, which was a bonus!  Another bonus of losing my hair was that it came back thicker, darker and curlier than it was before, which was the one thing I wanted!  This time around, the oral chemo doesn't have the hair loss side effect, although it says the hair can thin the longer the course of treatment. So far, my hair seems to be growing quicker and thicker than it was before!  Best wishes to everyone! Cathy",

I say that not only because I'll be able to do what I want when I can for whatever time I have left, but also because of the increasing pressure on my service to try and provide a gold standard service to an ever increasing population of patients with no extra funding (and often cuts in funding), in a team where people end up leaving and it is becoming difficult to get locum or permanent staff to cover. Before I went off sick, I was paid for 37.5 hours per week but was working 11.5 hours days every day and taking work home at the weekends just to cover the patient contact, associated paperwork/reports and team management stuff My team are a bunch of hugely dedicated, hardworking and strong ladies who want the best for all their patients but are often not able to provide what is needed, and this causes a huge amount of stress, not only to them but to the patients and their carers.  It's a shame, and SOOOO different than when I started 32 years ago!  RANT OVER... ",

Appointment was at 4:00 - we left at 2:00 to give us time, didn't go in until 4:35, got out of hospital at 5:15 and home by 7 o'clock!  Although the treatment appointments are generally slightly shorter than the planning ones, this was a fairly typical pattern last time around - 5 hours overall! Yesterday, 3 of 6 of the main machines were running up to half an hour late (the planning dept is separate) Didn't leave much time for working!  Cathy",

Mastectomy obviously messes with the nerve endings, so to get completely normal sensation back in the area would be a surprise I suppose.  That's just my take on it though, I might be wrong!!!  Best wishes Cathy ",

Tiredness is very common and so are aches and pains, but day 9 seems quite late to be having new side effects - normally by now, people will be starting to feel a little more human. Is your temperature normal? It is possible that you're brewing some sort of infection and it will be important to let the chemo unit know that you aren't feeling well and your symptoms - they will know whether it is normal or whether anything needs to be checked out at the GP or A&E. Never feel that you are bugging them  - it's what they are there for!  Please phone them as soon as possible, just to put your mind at rest if nothing else.

My lump was actually 10cm when they did the op, so not small. The consultant just picked it up as an area of different density rather than a specific lump and she was 90% certain it was cancer before biopsy! Apparently I have 'busy breasts' which have all sorts of things going on...!  So, don't feel bad about not noticing despite examining yourself, it may not be that unusual!  Best wishes and fingers crossed for as positive a result as possible.

      "Content": "Firstly, welcome to the forum that no-one really wants to be in, and for getting through the first chemo yesterday!  My advice would be:  - take the antisickness meds as prescirbed even if you don't feel sick at the moment - it can hit for a few days afterwards and it's easier to stop it starting than to stop it once it has appeared!  - if you are taking steroids, you might get a 'crash' when you stop taking them in a couple of days - that's normal but can be horrid and may make you feel tearful and low. - even if you feel normal, don't forget that your immunity will be lowered so you need to be alert for temperature above 37.5 and try to avoid 'buggy' situations and large crowds!  - be kind to yourself - even if you feel relatively well, chemo is human drain cleaner and fatigue may set it unexpectedly!  That being said, hopefully you'll be one of the lucky ones who 'gets away' with limited side effects! ",

      "Content": "MamaSm Sorry to hear that you're here on the roller coaster second time around... I was diagnosed in a similar way almost two years ago - I had a persistent cough for several months before seeing the doctor and the xrays and CT scans were abnormal. In my case, they found the lung spread first (they though it might be an autoimmune issue rather than cancer), but then they found a met in my spine and on more testing, found that the signs in my lungs were secondary to my original BC in 2013/14 (for which I had mastectomy, chemo and radiotherapy and Tamoxifen) I'm not surprised that you're in a whirl - hopefully you'll get more idea of what's going on when you see the oncologist - i'm sure that you're aware from last time that the waiting is the worst bit!  The GOOD thing is (if there is one, I'm a great one for silver linings) that bone mets, although not curable, are often the ones that can be kept on hold for a long time by fairly 'easy' treatment - injections/tablets, although some people do need more radical intervention. There are people on the forums who have lived with secondary bone cancer for many years. Hopefully any further scans that you have won't show any further spread to other organs.  Wishing you all the best - keep posting and let us know how things go!  Big hug to you!",

      "Content": "Not sure I can answer your question fully either, but a cyst is usually quite clear on ultrasound - they appear as black 'spaces' within the tissue - mine were drained under ultrasound and you could see them disappear as the fluid was taken out!  My BC 'lump' was not a lump but just a change in the density of the surrounding tissue - the radiologist picked it up pretty quickly and told me she was 90% certain it was BC. Even the breast nurse couldn't find a lump, despite her best efforts. I then had biopsies that confirmed it. After a second ultrasound that was viewed by several medical students as well as the consultant, they said I had 'busy breasts' - everything that could go on was going on, so I think the 'lump' could have been missed by a less experienced radiology consultant.   As granny59 says - if you're not happy and you're still in pain and worried, then ask to be seen again!

The one I have now is superb, and Leolady has the same one! She was much more proactive than me and complained about the cockwomble - I probably should have done but didn't. When I requested the change (he was a locum who had only been working there a couple of weeks), I was told that they'd already had complaints about his attitude etc - maybe I'd have been able to reduce the amount of people who suffered from his attitude if I had.  Request a new consultant  - it's your treatment and your body and you need people who will help you get through it in the best way possible! ",

Unfortunately, I'm not sure that any of us can say what the mark is as we are not medically qualified to do so. The good thing is that the Nurse Practitioner at the breast clinic and the dermatologist have both seen you personally, examined it and have said it's nothing to worry about. If the anxiety is a huge thing for you, and it sounds like it is, then I would advise going back to your GP (not sure what they call them over there!) and discussing that side of things, as it will not be healthy for you mentally or physically to be so worried about the possibility that the mark is a sign of something sinister.  Sending you a virtual hug and hoping that you'll find some relief from your anxiety very soon.",

I'm not sure who I'm making them for though - I'll end up with a house full of small animals!  If you like animals/toys, Alan Dart has a website where you can buy his patterns - they aren't cheap (go from about £2.50) but they are exceedingly well designed  - the squirrel was one of his, and so was the daschund I posted. I've also done mice and a large dragon of his: A lot of the patterns have more than one thing on e.g. I'm tackling Noah's Ark at the moment - you get to knit the ark, Noah and Mrs. Noah and about 10 different animals and I think the pattern was about £4. He also does some nice knitted Christmas tree decorations!  Plug over...  Oooh, and puzzles - there's a thought for a change! I've had quite a few given to me over the past few years and keep on starting them, but they get sat on or ruined by the cats! I got a jigsaw board thingy for Christmas, so might have a go at one of those when the knitting fingers gets worn out! I love this thread! ",

Firstly, I seem to remember there being steroids the day before the chemo rather than just on the day and afterwards. This is due to the fact that the T has quite a high incidence of allergic reaction (I had anaphylactic reaction twice so had to be taken off!)  The nausea/sickness is not a major problem, although they can still occur, along with abdominal pain if you're unlucky! The main things that people will say about T is 'being hit by the T truck' - about 3-5 days after the chemo, you can get severe muscle, joint and bone pain, which can last several days. A good selection of painkillers is a good thing to have ready!  Peripheral neuropathy (tingling, pins/needles, numbness, nerve pain) can also cause quite marked problems in hands and feet and people often have to have the dose reduced to make this and the joint pains more acceptable.  People can also have problems with nails going black and falling off!  Some people can get itching all over as well.  So, a different can of worms about to be opened! Hopefully you will only have minimal side effects and will get through this phase relatively unscathed! ",

The nurse who was with her asked if she could see if she could feel it (as I said I felt a bit silly not having noticed something that was actually almost 10cm!) and she couldn't either...  The cysts I'd had previously WERE easily felt though as they were hard and quite tender and trended to go up and down a bit with my monthly cycle.

It was because of these that I wasn't surprised when I got the recall from the mammogram - I had no idea about anything else being present.  Hope everything works out for you OP and that it is just a cyst.  Best wishes Cathy",

      "Content": "Hi Ruby Rose  When I was having FEC-T, hair loss didn't worry me at all - all I wanted was for it to grow back purple (it didn't!) or at least better than my previous hair, which was very fine and mousy. It did - came back darker, thicker and curlier! I went for headscarves (a different one for every outfit!) or commando and I actually found it quite liberating - it took so much less time to get ready for anything, especially as all the body hair goes as well... I was much more concerned about nausea and vomiting as I am emetophobic, so really don't DO that! However, that was also a lot less of a problem than I though it was going to be, so I got away pretty lightly overall. The other side effects didn't really worry me too much - just took them as they came up and was happy when they went away! Quite often, the thought is worse than the actuality, although that is not true for some people and I wouldn't want to make light of the side effects that some people do suffer, certainly not after my recent disastrous encounter with the last drug I was put on - that was over 6 weeks ago and I still haven't recovered properly! ",

No-one gave a second look when I was bald, not even children!  Since they reduced my dose of the current chemo, it's now growing back and about three weeks ago, it suddenly decided it was going to materialise into the chemo curl overnight! Let's hope it lasts as long as it did last time - I still had some curl 5 years after it grew back first time around! ",

Just thought I'd give you my experience, even though it's not all positive.  I initially went to the GP after having a cough for a couple of months (I previously had primary breast cancer in 2013) and Xray and CT scan showed inflammation of deep nodes in my chest as well as some thickening of the lobes of both lungs and plural effusion.  Initially they were looking for sarcoidosis or other autoimmune problems or ideopathic pulmonary fibrosis as there were no specific hard tumours in the lungs that they could see. However, after extensive tests and biopsies of heart tissue and lung fluid, they diagnosed secondary breast cancer (adenocarcinoma) in lungs and also in bones.  I was put on steroids and oral chemotherapy and symptoms are much better now. There is no surgery available on the lungs as the cancer has spread through the lymph system rather than forming anything removable.  Fingers and everything else crossed for your Mum. Don't be afraid to ask all the questions you need to at appointments!  Best wishes  Cathy",

There are plenty of meds available to counteract the main SE and I would advise you to ensure that you take these as prescribed and ensure that you ring the chemo team with ANY queries or problems - they won't want you to suffer and are really good at changing  or altering meds to help.  Be prepared to be kind to yourself for the first few days after the chemo session as this tends to be the worst time - after the first week, things tend to get better!

Someone on here has given good advice in the past - try to only allow yourself to think about cancer related worries for 30 minutes a day, then find something else to do!

I was given a second mammogram, ultrasound and biopsies at the recall and the consultant radiologist there told me that she was 99% sure that it was cancer there and then.There was no actual lump, but she could see small areas of calcification and a large area of tissue that was of slightly different density to the rest. I think that they use the 1-5 scale for likelihoof that an area is cancerous, 5 being 'highly likely' so they haven't actually diagnosed as they haven't had the specific results Obviously, I had to wait for the results of the biopsies to confirm it, but she was right! It would seem logical I suppose that a consultant who spends all their time looking at mammograms etc would be able to tell without definitive results. I think that they use the 1-5 scale for likelihood that an area is cancerous, 5 being 'highly likely' so they haven't actually diagnosed as they haven't had the specific results. The really hard bit is now waiting for the results so that you can have a specific paln for your particular results. I think everybody here who has been where you are would say - try to keep busy and try to keep away from Dr. Google as a lot of what you find on there may be out of date etc. Use up to date sites like this to keep informed. Don't be afraid to use this site to ask questions, rant, cry or laugh - responses will always be non-judgemental and supportive! In the meantime, have a hug - I'm sure you could so with one! #",

I take steroids regularly (prednisolone, but I assume it's probably the same for dexamethasone, which is often given in chemo)  and on the blurb it says that you need to tell the doctor immediately if you come into contact with people with chicken pox or shingles as they could affect you severely if you get them. It also says if you come in contact within 3 months of taking them, you should contact the doctor asap.  It also says very similar for measles!  Not sure if you can squeeze the vaccine in before chemo but it might be worth it if you can - check with the chemo team! Good luck!",

I did do it a couple of times on rough days as it was the only time I could 'swear' without it being swear words! :-D  FEC is definitely doable - hopefully you'll be fine. I didn't suffer particularly from side effects and was relatively 'normal' for two weeks out of the three. There were some 'lost' days where I slept a lot and didn't feel like eating, but it was okay overall.  I lost my hair (didn't go for cold cap as I'm cold enough for it to be hard to get veins to start with!) and it was actually quite liberating!

      "Content": "linda beth  A lot of places seem to do poracath insertion under local anaesthetic, so it is doable! Maybe it would be worth asking if that is possible given your bad reaction to GA!  I have a Hickmann line as my Trust don't use portacaths as a rule. It was done under local and took about 35 minutes - it was fine! I've now had it 3 + months and although it needs flushing weekly, which is a pain (portacaths don't) , I've not had any problems with it. I can't swim or immerse it in the bath, but that doesn't bother me. Again, that is different with the portacath as it is under the skin so no dangly bits!! ",

I put on a little bit of weight, but not much.  I was seen by gynae for thickened womb lining, but I had that before the Tamoxifen so it wasn't that!  I had several different brands and they didn't make any difference to me, although some people find that it does have quite marked effects.  I used to take them at night rather than in the morning. When I was in hospital, the pharmacist kept trying to get me to take them in the morning as 'that's when they are meant to be taken' but I think everyone finds the best way for them. I took them in the evening as I was happier having any hot flushes at night rather than during the day at work!",

      "Content": "Hi Daisydoo38 Bloody cancer - keeps dodging the chemo - mine seems to be the same!  I'm on Eribulin at the moment - this is my 12th cycle. I'm on 50% dose now as the first three cycles (100% and 2 lots of 75%) put me in hospital for extended periods due to severe neuropenia. On 100% dose, I also had a PE, which extended my hospital stay and I'm now on daily anticoagulant injections for life.  Now we've got the dose right, it still seems to be working on holding back the flood (I have secondaries in lungs and bones), so I'm on it for as long as it works.  Apart from the initial neutropenia, the main immediate side effects have been cumulative fatigue - I'm really tired a lot of the time now, some heartburn and cramp. The heartburn has improved recently, although that has now been replaced by mild peripheral neuropathy! The cramp is a pain - my magnesium and potassium levels are fine and you can't take quinine on Eribulin as it can cause heart arrhythmias and heart attacks, so is a definite no-no!  The other side effect that is a real pain for me is deteriorating vision - I've had four pairs of glasses since I started on the Eribulin and my last pair lasted 6 weeks before I had to go and get more - my vision has dropped from 20/20 with glasses to being on the legal limit for driving 3 times now, and as I was very short sighted before, we're not sure how many more times he'll be able to correct it!  I have antisickness IV before the chemo as my oncologist knows that I don't 'do' nausea and sickness! Apparently it's not usually an issue with Eribulin, so is not normally given but he humours me!  The good thing about the Eribulin IV is that it is the shortest chemo ever - 5 minutes! So, the antisickness IV takes longer than the chemo itself! I feel quite guilty at times breezing in for chemo and breezing out again 45 minutes later whilst other people are there all day!!!  If you need to know anything else, just ask!  Hugs to you - hope it works for you... ",

I'm sure some people who have had the combo or at least some of the single drugs will be along soon to give you further into.  Have you looked at the first post of this thread  - that has a link to tips for chemo which you might find useful.  It is difficult to say how you'll get through the chemo before you start as everyone is different in the side effects that they suffer and the degree to which this happens. Some people 'sail' (not really the right word) through chemo and manage to carry on largely as they have before, and some people suffer very badly and don't function very well for at least the first few days after the chemo session. The Docetaxel is well known for hitting people like a truck - aches and pains can be severe from about 3-8 days after the session, along with peripheral neuropathy. A lot of people find this more difficult to deal with than the sicky chemos as nausea and vomiting can often be well controlled. Stock up on painkillers!  You WILL need to be very kind to yourself - you sound like you have a busy life, but you can't 'expect' to carry on as normal as you will get tired and you are likely to suffer some side effects of some sort - I would think very few people would get away with none on a four drug combo. It might be worth planning ahead to see if anyone can help with the school runs if you need them to.  Wishing you well for your treatment and fingers crossed that you will be one of the 'lucky' ones who has as few side effects as possible! ",

Also horrid to be in a potentially infectious room when your immunity is low - keep asking for a private room!!!  As for reasons why your platelets have dropped so badly - I would have thought that if there were any platelet problems before the chemo, they would have picked them up when your bloods were taken before the session. If they were normal before, then it is much more likely to be a side effect of the chemo, even if it has come up a lot more quickly than would be expected.  Fingers crossed that they get you sorted asap and that you can go home and hug your small people!  Hugs to you",

I also don't drink enough normally, so always tried top make sure that I was well hydrated before they tried! Even then, it was a trial at times and I often ended up black and blue...  I think that if you have rubbish veins then there isn't actually a huge amount that can be done apart from cross your fingers for Friday and then go for the PICC line - hopefully that should solve the problem!  Sorry, that's probably not much help...",

Blood clots are more common in people with cancer in general as well as being a potential side effect of chemo - just another joy of the diagnosis!  You'll certainly know the way to A&E by Monday with all those appointments - hope everything goes well and that they don't find anything to be concerned about...

Apparently I have 'busy breasts' (well, only one now since the mastectomy in 2013!) with a lot of things going on cysts, dense tissue, lumps and bumps but it's always good to know that there is nothing sinister underlying things.  Best wishes - hope everything works out okay!

By the third time in the day, I'd almost convinced myself I must be ill...  When I had a large bleed after my mastectomy, the nurses all said I was almost invisible - I was so pale/translucent I blended in with the bed clothes!!!  It will be lovely to be able to have some grand daughter time - the reduced immunity can be a big issue with children around - buggy little things that they are! ",

Great news that you've finished treatment Matohu , but most of us will totally 'get' how you feel about finishing but still dealing with the fall-out, both physically and mentally! It feels 'weird' to be dropped after so long having appointment after appointment for 3-4 months or longer and suddenly you're there coping on your own, whilst other have this black and white view of being finished and back to normal!  You need to continue to let your family/employers know that you have fatigue etc as it may affect you for a while yet - I think it's difficult for others to see how cancer and its treatment can affect you on a long term basis!  I'm sending you 2 things (if it lets me post them): 1) Celebratory fireworks as you totally deserve them for finishing the treatment 2) Hugs, as you totally deserve them for all the different feelings you have about the path you've been on over the past few months!",
