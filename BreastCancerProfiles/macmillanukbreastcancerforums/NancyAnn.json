    "Content": "I had 15 treatments finished a week ago.  At number 6-7, I began having deep pain in rib area, and was hospitalized for possible embolism.  I knew it wasn't but I stayed a week while they figured it out.  I missed one treatment which was tacked onto the end.  All went reasonably well until about five days after treatment finished when I became really sick, nauseated, dizzy, etc. That lasted about two days, and then I got better.  The GP was invaluable in getting treatment for pain and Tamoxifen problems.  So, my contribution is to make good use of your GPs.  My skin held up well, and although lumpy and bumpy for awhile underneath, it could be a lot worse.  Anti-inflamatories seem to be very good for radiation side effects and collateral damage! My other contribution might be to ignore all the dietary advice everyone seems obliged to throw your way.  Hang on, it does get better. ",
