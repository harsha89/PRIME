    "Content": "Hi, had the mastectomy and all nodes out in Feb. My armpit still feels sticky now and again. A temporary annoyance. The soreness will ease though with regular physio exercises and painkillers as needed. However, if you have any doubts ask your care provider as one of the other ladies mentioned.  Wishing you a speedy recovery.",
