    "Content": "Hi guys, I'm new to this group. Any advice or support will be such a big help for me as I'm still trying to process everything to what's happened to me. It's just been over a year ago that I have been diagnosed with breast cancer. Having to go for scans and a biopsy at Glenfield hospital Leicestershire confirmed my worst fears, diagnosed DCIS cancer, stages 1 & 2. I had the disease that had killed my mother 28 years ago when she was only 50 and my sister 13 years ago aged 44. It's quite scary as I'm 44 now  Exactly last year Sept 20th, I had a mastectomy with a reconstruction done and from there on it sure has been a journey. This year, last month Sept 10th again, I had a second operation to my right breast, a reduction. So they've sent some samples away of the tissue that was removed and the results came back, that they have found some cancer cells, a small amount. I was told that I need to go for a MRI scan to check whether the remaining tissue isn't affected. Now I'm waiting to be told when I have to go for the scan.  It's all scary as I'm wondering maybe I should go for a double mastectomy? Even though I was told its not concerning, I feel it's too risky to keep it.  I don't know if I can still go for a double mastectomy, when I already had my reduction done to my right breast?  Any advice please? Sorry for the very long post, next time I'll try to be short, lol Thanks, Robin ",
