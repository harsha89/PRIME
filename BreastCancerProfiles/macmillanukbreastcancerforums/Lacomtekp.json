I had my tumour removed at the end of November, chemo started in January and I had radiotherapy 13 this morning.My actual tumour was a bit different and I won't be having any hormone treatment after the radiotherapy is finished. It must have been hard for you at times with the chemo on your own but in the future, with this site, if you have any problems or worries,there will always be someone to empathise or offer really helpful advice. I think you will be pleased you decided to join.  I am also retired but married and I live in France. As yet, I have had no problems with the radiotherapy but I imagine the 'sunburn' effect may start quite soon. I have, however, followed the regime with the cream and special soap exactly as I was instructed. Love Karen I hope to chat with you again.",

How strange you should be discussing the same thing here? The aim is to help with early detection in third world areas where an electrical mammogram could be very difficult. It sounds so bizarre, you have to check it isn't April 1st but no, this is a serious scientific trial using a doctor and a dog training specialist. I don't have any animals so I am fascinated that several of you are corroborating the theory. And as for our own smell........well last night I was driving my husband mad trying to locate the source of a smell of pickling vinegar which was making me nauseous. Naturally, we never found it. I blamed him and every neighbour in our hamlet! Love Karen",

      "Content": "I don't want to put a damper on optimism but unfortunately if you have one of the problems mentioned by Dreamthief, you may have to be prepared for this to continue for a long time. I am now 8 months post taxotere but my feet are still peeling. Most days they burn. There is a red line( although its a bit paler at last) all around the sides of my feet. I described the original pain like standing in a bowl of boiling water for about 3 weeks and that's what the red line looks as if I've done! When they're not burning, they are freezing cold and I get a lot of pins and needles or numbness. I have found a soft fleece, ( like imitation sheep wool) has been good in bed to stop the sheets rubbing. I wear quite flat shoes to walk. If you are having difficulties walking be careful. Walking badly to avoid the foot pain, I pulled the tendons at the top of my leg. I am still going to the physio for that. It did get better but just as my feet have improved from time to time, about 10 days ago, everything flared up again and I feel I am back at the beginning. I have spoken to my GP who has only been able to prescribe strong pain killers. It may go. It may not. I'm sorry to make it sound depressing.I don't want to worry those readers who haven't started taxotere yet. For most people the symptoms are not this severe. One or two people have already written that their feet peeled a bit and it stopped. At radiotherapy, no one else had any problems with their feet. The technicians all looked at mine. They hadn't seen peeling like it. They are dealing with hundreds of patients. It just shows that for most people this side effect stays away. But if you have it, you will know about it. You will sadly have to deal with it for some time.  I just seem to have got used to the discomfort. Moisturise often. Get a chiropodist to treat your nails and pamper the soles of your feet. My nails have not been a problem. I used evo nail until my hands started to peel and I couldn't apply it but I think it was worth the daily routine if you haven't started taxotere yet. The weariness does improve but it takes time and even now I have to take regular breaks from chores. I hope your problems do sort themselves out but if not, I'm afraid you may have to accept this is the new you and you will find you can manage it! Take care. Karen",

      "Content": "Hi Jane, I'm so glad you wrote your essay. I'm sure I won't be the only one who identifies with much of what you said. I'm not quite as far down the 'after treatment' road as you are and being much older, I was lucky because a routine mammogram found my cancer early before the nodes were affected and while the tumour was small enough for a lumpectomy in Oct 2015 followed by chemo and radiotherapy which finished last July. But I can still  identify exactly how you feel. The latest tests are clear. Therefore the cancer is gone......and yes, we should feel euphoric. My husband and sons see those results as being very good news and I do recognise they are. But like you, I have been left with a kind of unexplainable  feeling. I feel I shouldn't be complaining about the continued aches and pains. ( And I'm triple negative so all my treatments have actually finished) My feet still throb and burn paricularly at night. The problem with an aggravated tendon did improve but as I did more, got worse again so once again I am having difficulties with mobility. I have continual urine infections which apparently were caused by the chemo and the enamel is breaking away from my teeth which again has been contributed to the chemo. I try to do as much as possible but I am often so weary, I have to stop. Yet, I feel very guilty if I even mention these things to friends and families. I know how supportive they were when I actually had cancer. I don't feel I can expect them to understand now I don't! I should just be getting to grips with life, and despite the aches and mobility issues, live again. In addition, on this site , there are several ladies who have secondary cancers whose situation is so much worse than my own, that  I feel even more guilty for wanting to scream at the way the cancer treatments have affected my body. What can we do about it Jane? ......Probably nothing.....We  probably need to go on showing a positive front to the outside world. It probably wouldn't help us much if we disillusion our families who now think we're fine. But thankfully there is this site, where just occasionally we can show our exasperation at this horrible illness and discover we are far from alone in our feelings and our worries. I wish you Jane as pain free 2017 as is possible. At least for the present we are both cancer free. We've endured some pretty gruelling treatments and actually a year is not so long in the long term scheme of things. On the days our aches are at their most persistent, we will have to remember that they will probably lessen with time, because  time is what this unpleasant cancer treatment has actually given us! Good luck for that future. Love Karen",

Up until then I had just been losing little bits and pieces. He was in no doubt that chemo drugs may have contributed. I have six teeth which need rebuilding. I have an appointment next week for an estimate as I live in a place where dental treatment isn't covered. I think its going be too expensive for me. Dentist says its not the centre or roots, they are still strong. Just the enamel. I'm really interested that several of you are getting the same problem. There has to be a connection, doesn't there?

      "Content": "Hi Wombat, I just wanted to reassure you. Even the most supportive of husbands have bad days! Mine has been a real strength throughout. An insulin dependant diabetic he wasn't phased by illness. From the beginning he has looked everything up and has always been prepared for what is happening to me because he'd researched the procedures. When we saw specialists, he could ask the questions I didn't know about. BUT he had his bad days too. He worried about the outcome but it wasn't very macho to discuss his fears on 'a men's night ' out. It wasn't exactly that he wasn't sympathetic about the continual aches and pains, it was just to him the main cancer was being dealt with and I was going to get better in his mind so I needed to be positive to keep moving forward. There were certainly days when I commented about things people were suffereing on Macmillan, that he asked me to put it away. To try and live without thinking about cancer. Of course we know that's impossible but he saw it as a kind of ' out of sight, out of mind' scenario. If we didn't dwell on it.....it wouldn't happen!  He wasn't like that often. When the chemo made me very sick, when the taxotere effected my feet and hands, when I aggravated the tendon in my leg which has made mobility difficult, he was extremely understanding. He didn't expect me to do more than I could and did as much as he could to enable it. It was just occasionally that it all got too much for him too. And that seemed to manifest in the kind of outbursts you decribe......' what about me?'  Perhaps if we're in a partnership, difficult though it is because its only one half that has the illness, we need to remember that the other half has feelings too. Often feelings of being unable to help us when we look desperately ill but that there will also  be times when they can't see quite how unwell we feel and expect us to be more positive.  We  got through it by talking. I tried to explain how debilitating the aches, which he couldn't see, made me feel so he could understand better. And he told me how worried he was that the treatment wouldn't work and after 42 years he would lose me. But he also told me, he didn't want me to know he was worried. Luckily he can stop worrying now. My last mammogram shows for the time being the cancer is gone! Nowadays I am trouble because I continue to follow your stories and offer anecdotes if I can. He says it won't help me, despite possibly helping someone else leave the cancer behind.. I forsee another little 'talk' is required! Hope things go better for you today and it helps to know your situation has been shared. Love Karen",

      "Content": "Hello, It is a while since I have posted partly because  I have had an unrelated health problem and partly because I have been getting on with living! But I know how worrying it is when you have just been diagnosed or are feeling dreadful during chemo or radiotherapy so I thought I would just like to tell you that despite all these difficult days, there is light at the end of the tunnel. We sadly frequently hear from those who are unlucky enough for the cancer to cause continuing problems but not so often from those whose cancer has gone and is staying away. Today I had my third year mammogram followed by an ultrasound. It is still clear. My cancer has still gone. I have made a few changes to things I eat( dairy free) and products I buy ( paraben free) acting on advise but gradually over the last 18 months my energy levels have returned and my life back on track to be enjoyed. By coincidence it was exactly three years ago today I had my operation. Yes, the shock of finding the cancer makes you appreciate all the good things you have  and probably I do more now rather than delay them for another time. I also have been determined to say to well wishers who ask me how the cancer is going to reply that I haven't had cancer since the day the surgeon took the tumours away and the treatment was to prevent it's return.  Of course I know there is a chance it could still come back but it hasn't yet. I hope that will give encouragement to those of you who are beginning your treatments. I found it encouraging when a lady at my church told me she had had breast cancer 28 years previously. She also told me that she could have spent the years miserably worrying about the ' what if's' or she could do what she had done.....get on and enjoy every cancer free day she was offered. Amazing reassuring advice.....I am definitely trying to follow it and I hope you too will be able to look on the other side of the rough days, the worries and the discomforts and reach the day when like me you can say ' 3 years cancer free' because I'm sure you will get there too. My wishes to you all for successful treatments. Karen",

My husband has been insulin dependent for the last 35 years so we have plenty of fruit and veg, low sugar, low fat, variety of protein, some meat free days. I cook ' home recipes' most meals. But still the cancer came. So we decided, having read a few reviews, that we would not get obsessed but would introduce a few changes where appropriate.  We reduced dairy by swapping breakfast milk to almond milk on cereal and porridge but not in tea. We changed yogurts to soya, and single cream in recipes( sauces, quiches etc) to soya cuisine.We use a cholesterol reducing spread instead of butter for both spreading and cooking. I reduced alcohol but I didn't drink a lot and this reduction was as much about taste as a healthy option. We have at least one veggie meal a week and very little red meat using white meats and fish instead.  We always buy fresh vegetables and eat a large variety. We don't have large quantities of bread but buy either cereal or nutbread. Will it stop the cancer returning? ( I am triple negative) I'll tell you in 4 years time but at least I feel good that I've made a bit of effort to help myself. Karen",

      "Content": "Hello, I struggled too to keep down fluids after all my chemo doses. Each time for several hours even a sip of water made me sick. Although I had Emend from the first dose, I was still very sick and once I couldn't take a sip of water, I couldn't take more anti sickness pills. If this happens to you, you must make sure you monitor your temperature........mine got very close to the 'alarm' point on several occasions but luckily just stayed below. Once I had stopped vomiting after each sip of liquid, my husband made me a warm liquid sugar drink ( he is diabetic and buys sugar syrup for his sugar control) As well as replacing liquid, this gave me some energy as well. I didn't have very much to begin with but it was a start. Gradually we added infusions of ginger lemon tea. Most times I was unwell for 5-7 days and it was 10 days before I went out. Unfortunately, I didn't find this web site until I had already had 3 doses. Hopefully you will find some helpful hints earlier! I think if you are prone to sickness, as I have always been, it is very difficult to get through chemo without.  However, it passes. However awful you feel today, in a few months time, it will be over. I have now finished all my treatment and have just returned from a long holiday in Italy and the south of France. There are still foods and drinks I used to love which I don't like now but mostly things are back to normal. I hope you start to feel better soon. At least you have been able to use the internet......the lights and movement on my tablet screen made me very sick! Love Karen",

If she would like to chat to me from time to time as we go through the next phase, please click on my name to impliment the private line. Waiting for 4 more years for the final all clear will seem like an eternity I'm sure. I have already got appointments every 3 months until Sep 2017. I expect your wife has too. With regard the back pain, no, I don't have that but I am seeing a physio for something else. An old problem with tendonitis in my buttocks which makes walking very painful, flared up again. This is why I am writing to you because what the physio told me may reassure your wife. He told me that although there isn't a scientific fact, he sees so many post chemo clients who either have an old problem aggrivated or a new one starts. My GP was extremely sympathetic so perhaps your wife should speak to hers. I am having a shock wave treatment and massage. It is slowly improving. We can feel the tendon becoming less taut but its taking a while. If your wife's onco gave her the all clear I think she should take confidence from that. I know how reassuring the TEP scan was for me. Did you wife have one? I hope things work out for you both. Like my own husband, you are obviously extremely supportive and that is not always the case as this site often shows. Take care Love Karen",

Perhaps she had found that evonails own remover didn't work? Anyway, I used the non acetone. Three months post chemo my nails are still good. I had a few lines appear but they have grown through and the new nail is strong. Nothing fell off or went black. I think I may have stopped the evo nail a bit soon. I had some other problems with the taxotere which took my mind away from nail treatment so I would recommend you carry on after chemo finishes. I don't think I would have had even the lines if I'd continued. Hope the chemo is going well without too many side effects. Love Karen",

      "Content": "Hi Jemily, In my view you've more than passed the first test! What a lovely daughter you are........here you are asking immediately what can I do and will I be able to do it. Together you and your mum will work out what she needs. My experience from life is, that if you have to do something,you can. So please stop worrying yourself. You're going to make a great team. Now some practicalities. You will probably find that even if she is unlucky to vomit, she won't have been eating so from your point of view there won't be lots of mess. Just mum needing someone to hold or change a bowl, and put their arm around her when she's at a low ebb. My son was amazing. He set up the phones so I only had to ring an internal call button and if I was upstairs the phone rang downstairs and he came flying up to help me. The days after each chemo I vomitted a lot but I also needed to go to toilet lots too. If I moved on my own I was sick so it was great he was happy to help me to the bathroom and wait outside, then help me back. He brought me plenty of water to drink. He tried to tempt me to eat with toast or scrambled eggs. I didn't have to do anything. One area though  where my 'men' failed was helping me to wash when I was feeling very sick. I had a few accidents on the way to the toilet and could have done with a bit of female assistance. If you are aware this might happen to your mum, you can probably ask her from time to time, if she needs help., She will probably want to paint her nails daily with 2 coates of evonail. Maybe something else you can do. I always make a mess of my left hand! And remember........we are all different. She may not have more than a little nausea and then she will just need your company. You will probably have read, like I have, how difficult some ladies' families are towards them so its lovely to read how much you care and much support your mum is going to have. I hope all goes well for you both. Keep in touch and any problems you encounter, the experience on site, will find you an answer. Take care Love Karen",

Almost all our supermarkets do lovely ranges of lingerie and there will be plenty of non wired. They maybe a little more expensive as French ladies don't seem to mind  paying for their undies. They like matching sets but they are all sold separately. In addition if you have chosen a hyper market there will be lots of smaller shops in the entrance malls. Most womens clothes shops also do underwear. If you want some help with the conversion, just let me know your size before hand and I'll convert it for you.

Other tastes came back more quickly so I expect you will find something similar happens to you and you will be able to return to enjoying a meal. While I was having the chemo I did find the dilute bicarbonate of soda mouth wash did help take the metallic tastes away. I used it regularly ,4-6 times a day , whenever I had either an unpleasant sensation or taste in my mouth  and after every meal. I see you are nearly through the chemo so hopefully things will improve for you soon. Take care. Love Karen",

Like you, the treatment is over except for the treatments for the after effects which slowly improve. I am triple negative so I've nothing more to take. My first mammogram is the beginning of Dec and the follow up appointment Jan 4th but I'm lucky because here in France the radiologist will be a qualified doctor and he will tell me the results, examine me and perform an ultrasound immediately if anything isn't clear. So I know its daft to be worried but it is a bit scary. We have certainly ended up different people. I have become less blase about life and have realised how fragile our existence is and am determined to make the most of the future. I have lost weight and although I am not so mobile at the moment, I plan to keep it that way. At home, we've revised our diet and although its not drastic changes or banning anything, its much healthier. I have overhauled my friendship list. Cancer certainly sorted the chaff from the wheat! I have made new friends through the cancer. Some who had always been there, I just hadn't recognised their quiet presence until it was needed and some new. In my case, as a family, we have been brought together and that's a relationship I hope will continue. It was good to see how my sons rallied around their Dad to support him and in turn help me. I am already retired so don't have work to return too but I'm not going to waste my time. I've joined a book group and next week I'm going to try the Aqua gym.( Try because my energy levels haven't quite returned to pre cancer amounts) I have another 10 sessions of shock waves on my tendon but it is improving so hopefully that will clear it. So Loupielou, as we get ourselves through these quite anxious, waiting, weeks, I wish you every happiness for a long future! This is the point where actually we have to be positive....( horribly overused word!)......the shape of that future depends on it! Takecare Love Karen",

The surveon who inserted it, removed it. He was so gentle and so considerate making sure no blood would get on my clothes. Because mine was quite high at collar bone level, I couldn't see what he was doing but I felt nothing and suddenly it was done.  I think a port is the best way to have chemo.It's under the skin so doesn't prevent you doing anything. Nothing has to be flushed until your session in the chemo. The chemo becomes painless. Where I live,it's standard. Everyone has one without choice so when I was first diagnosed, I never questioned it but later, when I read on this site some of the vein problems sometimes experienced, I was glad Ihad it! Hope all goes well for you. It will seem frightening and unknown at the moment but amazingly, you suddenly find it all behind you, and hopefully with clear mammogram results for the future.

I have worn my turbans everywhere and everyone has realised in our local town, that I must have a medical reason. However, I have found that this has enabled people to talk to me rather than be embarrassed by it. Some have been really encouraging telling me their own experiences i.e. cancer 20 years ago and still fine, other's have needed reassurance from me that treatment locally is fine but most importantly, I have been able to encourage ladies( often total strangers who are just chatting to me over coffee in a bar) to take up the invites for their mammograms. Not everyone realised ut was possible not to know you had a tumour because its internal. I know that doesn't help Lizz and Sarah with your scarf in school problem, but I do think , if it was me, I would discuss it with whoever in charge and ask for their advise and suggested solutions.  I am a little ahead of you on the treatment ladder and technically its finished but I still find, if I spend too much time doing normal things out of the house, the fatigue just kicks in and I have no control over it and have to rest. I wouldn't want to working somewhere where no one knew why I felt like that. I also believe cancer is so common now and often so treatable, it shouldn't be hidden but mentioned like flu, so that it can be accepted and not a cause for hushed whispers and fear.

If my chemo was being cancelled ( as it was on 3 occasions) because the bloods weren't suitable, oncology phoned me by dinner time. I wonder why I had a general anesthetic? It was ok ofcourse but I had local for the removal last week. I know Lizz is having a lot of problems with her portacath but I haven't met anyone else, either in the chemo clinic or at radiotherapy who has had any difficulties. My instinct would be to say to anyone offered one, take it because I think it really does make having chemo easier. Karen",

If you follow the preparatory instructions and use a good cream after each session( in France we are prescribed 100% hyaluronique) you shouldn't have any problems and it is an extra precaution against return. The tablets are a different and more personal decision. There do seem to be a lot of contributors on this site who have experienced very painful side effects but the evidence does seem to suggest that taking the drugs is prolonging life expectancy. I didn't have to make that decision as my cancer was triple negative but I have to live knowing that there is a stronger chance it might return within the first five years. The thought, however positively one attacks daily living, is always just at the back of the mind. You don't seem to need chemotherapy which is a good start. That made me very sick and I think if my cancer returns( the chemo presumably won't have worked) I will think twice before accepting it again. I still have complications caused by it a year on. At the time I was too shell shocked to consider questioning any treatments and unfortunately didn't find this site until my third FEC dose. My own grandmother had her cancer in the early 1970's when the only treatment was mastectomy but she lived another 16 years dying from an unrelated illness in her mid 80's.So it is possible to survive without medical assistance.  I wish you luck with your decision. It won't be an easy one and it will be interesting to see how others reply. However, I suspect the people you really need to chat too, those who have turned down treatment ,will probably not feel the need to  be using this site either. Best wishes for the future.

Its so good to know that even with your basic treatments you have survived. With the excellent improvements we all have, we must all feel as encouraged as I do. Sadly age does catch up too, doesn't it?.....I suspect that you may well have had a few aches and pains by now without the cancer. I know my cancer free mother has had more than a few despite now being 90 years old! Take care and wishing you another 27 years! Love Karen",

      "Content": "Yes. I had the portacath. It was standard practice here so I wasn't offered a choice just booked in to see the surgeon, 2 weeks before chemo started. The real advantage, apart from being fitted under a general anesthetic so you feel nothing, is that its under the skin. I put on a local anesthetic patch an hour before I went for each chemo and I felt nothing. It only needs flushing when they give you the chemo and as its under the skin , you can shower or bath as preferred. I had mine out last week and again felt nothing. Unfortunately, it can't be used for blood samples but my nurses got around my lack of surface veins by using a needle designed to take blood from newborn babies. Its very fine because it goes into their heads. Its slower than an ordinary needle but it does mean you're not used as a pin cushion with abhorted trials. If you have problems with blood samples, I can recommend both. Love Karen",

I have just finished my treatment for a tumour found on a routine mammogram in October 2015. I have been told that at this moment in time, I don't have cancer. If it does return, I am having 3 monthly appointments for check ups. Things have progressed so much since your husband's first wife died. I'm not going to say ' don't worry' How can you not? But on this site we've all shared your worries. We can understand how difficult the next week or so will be as you wait for results and treatment decisions. We will sympathise if the treatments cause you problems because however different, we have all experienced some quite difficult days or decisions. Most importantly, we are here for the days you just want to rant or let off steam or are so afraid you need a cyber hug! I hope all will go well for you over the next few months but you must never feel you are tapping into a site where no one will hear you. There will always be someone here to support you. There were days which I would not have got through without it! Take care. Love Karen",

I have never said about them before as I don't like worrying new customers! As you seem to already have lots of pillows, my 'truc' probably won't be much use but I found soft, furry, fleeces folded into pillows and laid out between me and the sheets were very soothing. The softness and warmth seemed to help the aches. I also had problems with my feet. Hopefully you won't but you'll know if you do, and the imitation sheep skin on my fleece protected them from the hardness of the cotton sheet. I'm sorry you're feeling rough now but in six weeks, it will all be over so take courage from yhat! Love Karen",

      "Content": "I am so sorry you are feeling so hopeless. Persistant pain really debilitates you so it is no wonder you are feeling so confused. Like you,  my cancer was removed by a lumpectomy and I had no node involvement. Unlike you I was triple negative so there are no more treatments available to assist in preventing recurrence but the chemo took it's toll and I have been left with pain in my hands and feet and am having physio for pain in my leg aggravated by the drugs. However, I haven't been left to deal with these problems on my own and I really think you need to chat to someone about how depressed you are feeling. Is there a cancer support group in your area or do you have a good relationship with your cancer nurse? I think when your doctor was talking about the 5 and 10 years he was trying to encourage you without realising how confused you were feeling. I can understand that if the meds are making you feel life isn't worth living, the thought of more years must seem interminable but the fact is, taking these drugs seem to be keeping the cancers away for longer. Hence I suspect the doctor thought you would be reassured knowing you could take the drug for as long as 10 years. I am sure others will write to you soon and make suggestion of changes you can make which will make the pain more manageable but as I have said, I can't help there because I can't take anything for the negative analysis.However,  I would mention to your doctor about not being able to paint too because I couldn't knit last year because my hands were so painful but I was prescribed Lyrica and now the pain can be managed.  I can  tell you that the reason I came back onto this site tonight was because my second year control mammogram was clear yesterday which means 2 years of the 5 have now passed successfully. Yes, ofcourse I wish I was pain free but I am glad to be alive. There are still so many things I want to be able to do.  Once you have had a chance to talk this through with people who can offer you advice I'm sure you'll start to feel this way too. Please contact someone very soon and I hope you start to get a chance to begin living and doing the things you want before too much longer. We are almost the same age and my cancer was.diagnosed only a few months before yours in Oct 2015. Love Karen",

If you did ,my surgeon said 6/ 8 weeks for the arm pain to settle down. Like you I had started chemo by then which brought it's own problems. One day I realised my arm didn't hurt any more and when I counted back, it was exactly 6 weeks since he told me and 8 from the lumpectomy and node removal. Hope that helps a bit.

      "Content": "I hope you can get the hylaronic cream because it worked really well and is reimbursed. All the ladies I chatted to while waiting for radiotherapy ( and you tend to see the same ones every day although when you start some will be just finishing and by the time you get to the end,new ladies will have joined) all agreed they had practically no problems. It was only the 3 who used the cream the wrong way around who had difficulties. I don't know whats in the R1 R2 cream but I wouldn't dismiss the one we were using until you've tried it. Its nothing like a normal moisturizer or E45. Its much thicker and some days the residue was quite difficult to wash off. It certainly makes a protective barrier throughout the day. The cotton bra is a must in the heat to stop sweating but I know you already asked about those so you have probably got it by now. I found a deodorant with no perfumes or parabens in Lidl and used it under the good arm although washing with the savon surgras under the shower every day did seem to reduce sweating too. Although I finished my radiotherapy mid July, we had had a number of upper 30°s days by then. I'm not sure what side effects you're worried about but do try not to worry. I think modern equipment has eliminated the horror stories. I never met anyone with a problem in the entire 7 weeks.  After all the problems I had with the chemo, the only thing that scared me was the tattoo and as I've said before, I was still waiting for them to be done when she told me she was finished. Idiot that I was! I'm sure it will go well for you and hopefully you are making a good recovery. As you are back at work, I guess you must be feeling a lot better. Sadly, I don't have much mobility yet after my feet problem and I do still get very tired, quite quickly but I am hoping things will start improving more rapidly soon., We will be in Italy until the 18th then returning via Nice ( 4 days) and visiting our son in the Landes for another few nights as we travel northwards.

      "Content": "Hi Lizz, My scar is still slightly darker but as Jo says, it blends in. More important is the cream.Didn't your onco give you any prescriptions? Angouleme have been so helpful and I think more informative. I had no problems with 33 sessions so perhaps you can follow what Angouleme told me. The cream they gave me was 100% hydraulic?( sorry I'm in Italy and haven't got it with me but the onco or your gp will know what I'm trying to remember.Its very similar to that) Its on the 100% prescription and it won't cost you. Now the procedure. Technicians at Angouleme checked regularly everyone was doing it in the right order. Its really important apparently. Before you go for the radiotherapy, shower or wash the area really well with a savon surgras or douche surgras. This is quite expensive  savon as it comes from pharmacy ( 7\u20ac) but it lasted the 7 weeks with plenty left over. Just as I was finishing treatment Dove launched a shower gel ' protection surgras'. I have been using it since as its thick and creamy but I don't know how it would have compaired with the soap during the actual treatment. Anyway, the technician explained to me the significance of washing everything off the skin, it helps prevent burning. Unlike sunburn which is the term they always used to describe anyone unlucky enough to react, the skin must be cream free for the treatment. After the treatment apply it liberally twice a day. Remove again before next session. When I was going 3 French ladies had misunderstood and burned terribly because they put the cream on before they went. The technicians came around again that morning and checked we all knew what we were doing. I also had a prescription for some hydroplats which were like cooling plastic to put on anytime things got sore but I never opened the packet until I got stung by a wasp 3 weeks ago and needed something to cool the burning! I suppose the reaction to theradiotherapy may depend on the age of the machine. At Angouleme they are relatively new. My chemo onco told me the radiotherapy onco is her husband and he insisted on new machines when he took charge.  I found the 7 weeks passed very quickly. I had a taxi and I know you will be entitled to one too. It made the journey far less tiring. The treatment takes no longer than 10 mins a day. The booster sessions at the end less than a minute. The staff should check your skin every day. They won't let you burn. On a day when I had a little redness over the lymph node scar, they gave me a small tube of even stronger cream to put over it. It was back to normal by the next session. I have realised reading your reviews that even in France all health departments vary. Hopefully you can get this cream in time to work. I think you will have a few days. Although I did start from day 1, I remember reading that it takes about a week for real problems to develop if you ignore the procedure. Hope all goes well and that you get to see this reply as my internet connection is very poor from my holiday gite. Take care. Love Karen",

I was also given a prescription for some cooling gel plaques to go under the breast if it felt bur t but I never needed to open the packet. The technicians monitored my skin daily and only once was I given an extra cream to rub over the scar where the lymph had been removed. I didn't have any discomfort but the technician must have thought I might be going to develop some. My skin is very fair. I was blond before chemo! I cannot see the point in terrifying you with the worse case scenario. If you are very,very, unlucky, surely the technicians could deal with any problems then? To reassure yourself, I would ask the other ladies when you go tomorrow if they have had these side effects. My husband says if they have, walk away and ask to go to another unit because the only explanation he found for burning was very old equiptment. I was told by my onco, my machine was recent and it certainly caused me no complications. Good luck.Don't worry too much tonight and I hope all goes well for you. Love Karen",

I have had to take Tramadol for the tendonitis I have through my hip but I'm taking ibuprofen during the day. I was given some painkillers which contained opium but I didn't find they worked at all. I think you have to at least discuss it with your oncologist. You know your appointment will be confidential so he can't tell your employer. You may find things get easier in a few weeks. You've been off work a while and even without the cancer problems,  you would feel very tired and aching, restarting. I think you said there is a young baby so I expect you've been doing lots of extra lifting.  I'm sure the oncologist will understand how important work is for your morale. You need to feel 'normal' to keep on fighting. Everyone is different. I probably would not have wanted to go back to a demanding job in your shoes but I can also understand why you feel the way you do and want to do it. Hopefully though,  if it doesn't get any easier in a few weeks, you won't let the pain get too servere before you consider the 'resting' advice. I don't think it will be worth overdoing things just to chase your old normality. Perhaps you will have to have a rethink and look for something different, less physically demanding, but which you would also enjoy.? What about a teaching assistant with slightly older, perhaps handicapped children where you wouldn't have to lift them but would still need to give them lots of time and care.? Let's hope next week is easier but do check the tramadol/ paracetamol info because I know all my packets say one or t'other. Are you working weekends? If not, have a good rest. ( I just remembered you had a chest  infection at Christmas didn't you? I bet that's still affecting your energy levels and giving you some pains too.) Hope you feel better soon. Love Karen",

I have had 5 chemo doses with 24 radiotherapy to follow but this time, I have been so ill with the PP, hands/feet problem that I don't feel I can attempt the 6th session. I haven't been able to walk more than a few steps since Monday and the burning in both feels as if I have plunged them into continually boiling water and left them submerged. I am still being sick each time I eat so I am weak and keep crying. It was actually my husband who suggested we discuss with the oncologist next week whether to stop. Like you I had no lymph involvement and my small tumour was sucessfully removed at the end of November. My chemo has dragged on as 3 times the white cells were too low. I've forgotten at this moment which was negetive and which was positive of the other results but I was told that oral wouldn't work if I didn't have chemo first so I did as I was recommended but now I don't think I have any more strength for session 6. I think I shall take a chance unless absolutely convinced otherwise! Thanks again for your helpful insight. Love Karen",

Its the best possible scan there is to determine any other possible problems but as I said before its done here routinely to illiminate them. Once you have that result, you will know exactly where you are.  I don't know if they have teams in the UK to determine your treatment but my surgeon told me that no treatment decision is made here in isolation. In my case it was a team of 4, the surgeon who was a gynecologist, the oncologist, the radiologist and the radiotherapy specialist.  I am now 4 sessions through the chemo which will be followed by 6 weeks radiotherapy.  Good luck on Friday and don't worry too much. Just think how lucky it could be organised so quickly to put your mind at rest. P. S. France where? Maybe we are near each other and can cheer each other up!",

      "Content": "I am an hour north of Bordeaux, just south of Angouleme where all my treatment is organised. A bit far to meet up for coffee yet but we'll make a date for the late autumn and meet in Bordeaux when we're both over the worst! In the meantime you can contact me whenever you like as being a few weeks ahead of you, I may be able to give you odd bits of info to reassure you. The procedure for your TEP scan is a little different from mine. I am wondering if you speak french? The 3 hour interval is the same, as is the radioactive injection but I wasn't allowed to move once the injection was given and certainly the literature I was given emphasised this. I was very worried in advance that I would need to move because I have a problem with a leg nerve but actually they made me very comfortable getting the bed chair exactly right and it had lots of padding under the arm with the drip in it, so I worried for nothing. Maybe you should query the procedure at your meetings today? After an hour of being still I was helped to the toilet then I was in the scanner for about 40 mins. Afterwards I dressed, then waited about another 30mins for the expert to check nothing needed redoing. The scanner was much easier than the IRM as it had air conditioning and I had some where to hold onto. Also my oncologue had told me to keep my eyes closed thoughout as I have a history of vertigo. Again beforehand I had worried if this would be possible but actually I was very drousy from the perfusion and I just dozed. I felt very stupid for being so anxious in the days before. I kept wanting to cancel it as like you the tumour had already been removed and we had the tissue and lymph analysis but oh!....the reassurance when I was told a few days later, there is nothing to worry about anywhere else and chemo will deal with what is already known. I don't know if this site lets you give personal details so here are the clues if you want to find me. My server is aol.com. If you look at my pen name here.......knock off the 'p'. Put in an @ sign instead. You should have it! Best of luck today and tomorrow. Don't worry too much. I think you and I are very lucky. Not only will everything possible be done for you (and me!) but it is explained and we get to keep all the information too. The fact that in both our cases a very small tumour was found and already removed is a great start! Take care. Love Karen",

I'm always watching adverts for European rivers which look lovely. Alternatively what about the Lake District? A nice hotel and day trips on the lake. I'm sure I saw that advertised recently. Wherever you go....have a lovely break. We have left ours until the end of my treatment and living in France, can go to lots of lovely places by car and without the worry of insurance, so we are driving down to Italy in September. My husband booked it when I was really sick with chemo and having the photos to hand really helped me through some bleak days. Now it is only 6 weeks away. I'm so excited! Take care. Love Karen",

      "Content": "Hi,  I going to back up Dreamthief totally here.  The best decision we ever made was to face reality and take early retirement!  It came to us not because of the cancer but the result of a head injury. My husband's health had also been deteriorating for a while and he had been having difficulties managing his insulin dependent diabetes with a full time job.  We were lucky in so much as the head injury enabled me to claim my teaching pension which was enhanced and it also qualified us for a small amount of incapacity benefit. More importantly the application for the incapacity, kept my state pension contributions up to date, regardless of the financial amount.  So we adjusted. Used the equity in our house to buy a dilapidated cottage in SW France and haven't looked back since. We lived off very little money but managed( special offers enable treats just as before) and always have things to do. How did we fit work in? No idea! Now we have qualified for our state pensions we actually feel quite rich! I loved my work but life is more important. Make the most of what you have if you can and if you are prepared to make some changes ( this usually means swapping ' material' for esthetic) you won't regret your decision and feel so much better in yourself. Good luck in 2017 with your decisions. Karen",

      "Content": "Hi, I had a similar problem with what to tell my 90 year old mum. Slightly different reasons.......she's from a generation where the word 'cancer' is a death sentence. In the end I told her that the mammogram had found a nodule which was going to be removed and tested. Afterwards I explained the chemo and radiotherapy as preventative because analysis had shown the possiblity of cancer in the future. My surgeon had told me that he was sure he had removed all the tumour so I never actually lied to her and she coped with the knowledge that the other treatments were the best thing possible for my future. Your children could be told something similar but they are young. They will understand cancer is now curable in many circumstances so I think in your situation I would tell them. From what you have written it looks as if they don't have too much to worry about and you will probably find it helpful if they understand why you are not feeling yourself. My three sons have been extremely supportive especially to my husband whom had someone he could chat things over with when I was particularly unwell. Whatever you decide, I hope everything goes well with the operation next week. Love Karen ",

      "Content": "........and if you can't for some reason get the R1 or R2 from your doctor  or oncologist, my prescription was for a cream which is 100% acide hyaluronique which we think is hyaluronic in English. I have just completed 33 sessions of radiotherapy, without a mark or skin discoloration. I was blond with very fair skin( maximum factor sun cream all my life) I used the cream twice daily as recommended, washing it off in the shower every morning before the next session, with a 'savon surgras' which appears to be a soap free bar but it is recommended for dry skin and does remove any excess cream. It was stressed by the technicians at my unit that your skin must be clean and creamfree for the actual session. As it worked, I guess they knew what they were talking about. I chatted to other ladies waiting for their treatments. Most had no problems like myself, a couple a very small, light burn on the scar tissue and three ladies who had misunderstood the instructions and creamed before the radiotherapy, burnt badly. Personally, having had a few nasty chemo side effects, I found the radiotherapy, apart from being time consuming when the hospital is nearly an hour from home, cery easy.  If my cancer comes back, I might think twice about having chemo again in the doses I had this time but I wouldn't hesitate to repeat the radiotherapy.

      "Content": "For those people who like facts over opinions or maybe for opinions, I should say, experiences, here is a fact for today. This morning I saw the oncologist. He gave me the 'All clear'. I don't have to have any more treatment. I will have control checks every 4 months for a year or so which will be varied but at this point in time I don't have cancer. I feel very lucky. I know it won't be so easy for everyone but it does make all the discomforts from the chemo ( and I had my share) worth while as far as I'm concerned. When I started this discussion I never meant to imply that people shouldn't consider information about taxotere. I just didn't want them to be put off treatments by the things they read as what they read may never happen to them. We are so lucky that treatment has advanced in the way it has. I was talking to a lady yesterday at church who had a mastectomy in 1988. Her husband is sure that with modern techniques, she would probably only have needed a lumpectomy. She wasn't offered chemo or the scans we get which are so reassuring. Research is beating this disease and treatments are being improved and adapted all the time. I know this is just my own personal opinion but if a few months unpleasant treatment gives me back the rest of my life.........I'll take it! Love Karen",

      "Content": "Hello all,  I have decided to start this discussion because I have been very concerned of late by how worried some chemo patients seem to be by their move from FeC or Ec to taxotere. I'm not sure what has prompted this but I feel it needs talking about before someone abandons their treatment through fear. I did have problems with Taxotere which is why I feel qualified to begin this discussion and because I also know that there are many recipiants out there, who do not. I have just completed 7 weeks of daily radiotherapy. My hospital is fortunate to have several machines so it groups its patients, as far as is possible, by the type of cancer being treated. Therefore, mornings in waiting room 1, everyone was recovering from breast cancer. Of course not everyone had needed chemo but the turbans, scarves, and wigs were a tell tale sign of the numbers who had. During 7 weeks I met a lot of people, those just completing treatment, those who began around the same time as myself and towards the end, those just beginning. It was helpful meeting other patients. We discussed our problems ( and our future hopes) just like we do on this line. I never volunteered my taxotere reaction but my problems were so obvious ( slippers and slow movement!) that most days some one asked.  And here comes the point of this article............... No one I met during those 7 weeks had had a reaction like it. I must have met 30 to 40 different people and none of them had this reaction Look at a side effects list.......it will appear as an everyday occurrence. In addition none of the radiotherapists had seen feet like mine either. ( Or the district nurse who I saw for something unrelated) We are always saying 'Everyone's different' and we are. On this site, we often comment when we have a problem and need help. Not many of us use this chat line to say ' I'm fine. No problems with chemo etc etc' but being treated at the same time as us, there will always be many people who don't need this line because they don't have any problems. They are fine and we don't hear about them. Only in the radiotherapy waiting room, did I realise how many other women had had very little discomfort at all from their treatments. If you are unlucky and have a reaction, there will unfortunately be little that can be done. However, time passes and things improve. My problem ( which I'm not detailing because it would worry some of you more and you will know if it develops!) has almost gone. It has taken 3 months and my last chemo had to be abandoned but in six months it will be a distant memory. My advise would be to stop worrying. Taxotere for most people is unpleasant at worst and for many much better than FEC. If you should react, you will know, so contact your clinic immediately but until that happens look at the positives. For most of you when you start the Taxotere, you are half way through your  chemo treatment. Soon you will be on the path to full recovery! Please don't panic and don't give up the treatment! Good luck to all Love Karen P.S. I hope you have this lovely weather in the UK. Its uplifting. I had breakfast outside but at 7.30 it was too hot to sit in the sun!",

      "Content": "Hi, The advise from the beautician in my chemo clinic was to use evo nail. 2 coates daily for 7 days, remove in the evening with acetone free remover, oil cuticles with argan oil, sleep and begin the 7 day process again  in the morning. I did this from the first day until unfortunately another problem with my hands after chemo dose 5 prevented me continuing. I did my toe nails too. I am certain if I could have continued for a month or two after chemo, I would have had very few problems because as it was none of my nails have lifted or blackened. ( My Chiropodist is delighted with my toe nails. She has seen lots worse) Unfortunately because I stopped a little early, my finger nails flaked a little but I regularly trimmed the flakes. I took my nail scissors with me everywhere and trimmed whenever was necessary to prevent them catching and tearing.  The problem grew through in about a month. Now my nails are stronger than before the cancer and I wore silver nail polish on Christmas day to celebrate my clear mammogram! I bought my evo nail from the pharmacy. I texted my husband from the chemo unit at 10.30. He went to the pharmacy. The pharmacist ordered it and when I got home at 2.30 p.m. it was waiting for me! It wasn't cheap but I really think its worth a try. Wishing you all success with treatments in 2017. For the time being mine are over. Love Karen  ",

      "Content": "Hi Karen, Have you tried the Loperamide? Trade name Imodium. If you haven't give it a go. I had terrible diarrhoea after trying to correct constipation. My onco had already given me the imodium prescription ' in case' so I had it here to take dtraight aeay once I realised what was happening. You take one everytime you pass liquid stools but it only took 3 times until it stopped. When it started again a few days later, I followed the same procedure. If you have already tried the imodium and it hasn't worked, I think you should call your onco. If not, please give it a try. This is not ' popping pills' but trying to correct the disturbing effects of probably the strongest drugs you will ever take! ( fec, taxotere or whatever you are having for yor chemo) Hope you feel better soon. Love Karen P.",

      "Content": "Carolyn hi, I have 2 more successes for your list. Firstly my grandmother diagnosed in 1971 when treatments were quite basic. She had a mastectomy as that was the only option, no chemo because it wasn't there and I'm not even sure she had radiotherapy. However, she lived for another 20 years afterwards, dying aged 88, from something totally unconnected with cancer. Secondly, like Kacang, I had a lady at church who I've known for at least 15 years, come over to me, to tell me that, ' It was 22 years'  since her breast was removed. She had never had a reconstruction but wears a soft falcie! I had had no idea. You're right Carolyn........we need a special section with all these success stories listed. On days when percentages of survival seem to weigh us down, or chemo is making us really sick or we're just frightened for the future, we need to read these to reassure ourselves that 25 years from now, we'll be the examples on the list. If we don't let ourselves believe that......we might as well give up today! Keep your spirits high everyone ( have a cognac if its easier!) Love Karen",

      "Content": "Hi all,  My husband and I looked at this and decided we probably had nothing to lose by reducing dairy and meat products. A good, balanced mix seems like a good compromise without becoming an obsession. So we have swapped our breakfast milk to almond milk but left the milk in our tea cow's. We have changed our yogurts to soya which are actually  more flavoured and last week I used the soya cooking cream to make a quiche. You couldn't tell the difference. We rarely eat butter although I do use it to emulsify. We thought if we had more poultry or bean dishes in the week, red meat would automatically be reduced. We quite like the soya burghers. They aren't exactly a substitute......more a different meal option ,served with salad and a jacket potato. We like beans in soups anyway. I don't seem able to buy quorn here. The French like their Limousin  beef and steak hache. Will any of this help the cancer stay away?.....We feel it's worth a try......what have we got to lose? Its a bit like using the mouth wash during chemo. It took very little effort and it may only have been a coincidence I had no mouth problems, but I did it. This is the same. If reducing dairy has no effect at all, the diet is still a healthy one. It still includes some products for the calcium but reduces some of the other, less healthy ingredients and it is a diet with plenty of variety, so we're unlikely to give up through boredom.  Finally, as I still have mobility problems courtesy of the chemo, a reduction in some calories has got to help balance that and soya based products are certainly lower in calories! Off to enjoy my almond flakes! Love Karen",

      "Content": "Hello, What a lovely friend you are.....and I'm sure whatever gift you give your friend will give her a chance to feel normal again. However, at my clinic a beautician came to see me during my first chemo session. I followed several of her recommendations. The most important may have saved my nails.It might have been coincidence but they never went black or fell off. She told me to use Evo nail twice a day for 7 days then remove it with an acetone free remover on the 8th day. Then start again. I did that every day until I had finished both chemo and radiotherapy.About 9 months. I did my toe nails too and my podologue was really impressed with them.  Perhaps you could treat her to these items as they are not inexpensive? The beautician also recommended I rub argan oil into my head after I lost my hair. I didn't have a wig but used bamboo turbans I bought online and bought inexpensive head bands from shops like Claire's Accessories to match my clothes to decorate them with. If your friend is losing her hair, that might be another idea. All shampoos and shower gels should be paraben free. Creams and soaps are best scent free. Deodorant aluminum free. I don't know if it helps but three years on my cancer is still gone and I feel if it came back and I had ignored the advice, I would never know. I still buy these toiletries. Happy Shopping.....

Where possible we take our results away with us or at least receive a telephone call at the first possible opportunity. I was told my biopsie would take 10 days but actually received the call from my GP on the 8th day. He was very reassuring although of course a lot more analysis needed to be done but he had made all the relevant appointments for just a few days later. If it can be done here, why not in your area? I know that doesn't help you but I think you should continue with your challenge to obtain something which should rightfully be yours anyway! My only word of caution would be don't get yourself too upset......that won't help you long term if you do need treatment....but if it helps you deal with the delay, carry on. Please let us know again tomorrow if you have made progress! Love Karen",

Your bod is going to take a lot of time to recover even if it isn't showing it by feeling painful. Those 'depressed' feelings are very normal. Even now, 9 months on ( and a painful wasp sting!) I can suddenly find myself weepy for no apparent reason. Waiting for my mum and dad's plane to land yesterday I was really tearful. Why? No idea. It wasn't as if they were going home. I'm glad your little girl likes her child minder. Don't feel guilty about it. You're going to need all your strength for the next stages of treatments. Enjoy your day out tomorrow but hopefully chose somewhere where your little girl can run around and you can sit in the shade and watch. I can understand why you felt the company at work would do you good. I expect it did but perhaps next time you could join them in yheir lunch break without actually working! I was lucky because we are 'old' and retired but on days when I had enough energy, my husband took me to a cafe and left me to chat with friends while he did the chores! I often found even that was exhausting.  It must be difficult when you are younger. I expect your husband can only cope with your illness by ignoring it to some extent. Perhaps it would be helpful for him to read some of the articles on this forum then he would see that you aren't any different from the rest of us. We have good days and terrible days. We have days when we're exhausted and days when we cry at everything. We have aches and pains and sickness and days when we feel really well. But most importantly, every day is a day towards being recovered from cancer. It may take time, but in the end we have a future. Hope you enjoy the rest of the week. Love Karen",

I don't know if it has helped or whether its just a coincidence but I have not had any mouth problems. I understand both the FEC and the taxotere could have produced some nasty mouth ulcers so it might be worth trying the pharmacist's advice too. I hope you have success with your wig. I didn't have one because my hairdresser thought I might look better in the turbans as my hair was very straight and fine. The turbans have been a success.

I am going on holiday for September so I will be too busy planning for a month away to let it worry me now. I'll keep in touch from time to time to see how everyone's doing.

We might feel positive and enthusiastic but our bodies let us down and we simply can't do the things we used to or would want to. It does improve. I am having my one year 'control' mammogram next week and I am doing more. I can finish the shopping now. I can get the washing out on the line.  I am going to Aqua gym. I need less afternoon rests. It sounds so lazy compared to those who have returned to work but mobility complications caused by the chemo have slowed me down.  Like you Ronstar, I felt I should be doing more. There were days when I despaired. Thank goodness I had a supportive husband who recognised the efforts I was making and the distress it caused me. He told me he couldn't imagine how I could have been more positive and he certainly didn't consider I was lazy. I had simply been left unable to do things. Between the post chemo fatigue and the mobility problem, he was impressed, he said, by what I did try to get done. It was important to hear that. Just like your thread Ronstar. Its so important that those new to treatment recognise everyone is going to be different. There is not going to be a 'normal' recovery pattern. Everyone will have their own. And those who are finished with treatment and still feel rough.......don't feel guilty. That's as normal as those who are back at work.  Yesterday , a friend who I knew had had breast cancer some time ago, told me she was never sick. She had an agressive level 4 cancer and that was 9 years ago. She says she knows she was lucky on both counts.  But you know, however the treatment and recovery effects us, we are all lucky. Our cancer has been found and dealt with. So many cancers lie undetected until its too late to treat. Treatment may not be nice , some of us may take longer than others to recover, but in the end the future is there for us all,  just around the corner. Roll on 2017! Love Karen",

I suspect you may find your temp starts to rise over the next couple of days. Most people seem to find they get very hot during days 2 and 3. Just keep an eye on the the advise for a high temperature. I had a few problems and got quite close at times but never over and eventually it went down on its own. Remember to drink plenty of water. Not always easy if you are sick too but keep trying anyway. Thinking of you over the next day or two. If you feel awful just remember it does stop after a few days and every day is a day nearer to the finish. Love Karen",

      "Content": "Gloria and Jenny, I agree with everything Kacang has written. I live in France. Everyone I know here has the portocath as standard before the treatments start. I had mine in from December to August. As I had a local anesthetic patch to put over the entry one hour before chemo started, I never felt a thing for any dose. Mine was put in under general anesthetic but removed with a local. Fatigue was a different matter. Even several months after the treatments( chemo and radiotherapy) had finished, it would sweep over me and if I hadn't stopped and sat down, I would have fallen. It didn't matter if it was housework or shopping or just walking in the street. Several times, I had to abandon my shopping trolley and go and sit down in the entrance seating and queuing for the till was particularly draining. It was months before I could go on my own.  But we are all different. Chemo made me very sick. Sometimes it was 10 days before I could even think of leaving the house and then only to sit in a cafe while my husband did the chores. 3 times my chemo was delayed by low white cells......that was particularly debilitating. I was advised not to drive and I didn't until after my radiotherapy had finished. In my case, it would have been disastrous if fatigue had affected me whilst on the road. There was no way I would have been able to work.  Luckily I am retired and didn't need to make that decision. I couldn't look at a tablet screen  for the first days after chemo and could barely look at a book throughout. However, I know friends on here who have worked throughout. Their sickness and fatigue has been very manageable. They have had few side effects from the drugs, especially the tax. There is no right or wrong response......the drugs will just effect your body as they will. I have also known people who were hospitalised every time and I myself have been left with some fairly uncomfortable foot and leg problems, one year post my last chemo.  But the cancer is gone. Life has resumed although maybe a little more carefully with a few healthy changes here and there. I hope your treatments continue well. The portacath will be a godsend and the having new lesson plans will make your return to work less stressful. Take of yourselves. Love Karen",

      "Content": "Hello, I am sorry you having such worries.I'm not a doctor so I can't allay your fears either but I can offer you some reassurance.....someone is investigating your problem very quickly. Whether you are sent for a biopsy later or the cluster is recognised as cysts , it's being dealt with. This is important because should you need the treatment in the future, there is no doubt early detection is the key. My own cancer was found early three years ago by a mammogram. Opposite to your situation, I had no outward signs and had been so blazé about the whole thing, I only went by chance. However, luck was on my side and very small but already aggressive tumours were found and removed. My most recent mammogram was still clear.  So, I guess what I am really saying is that naturally you are going to worry about the unknown until someone gives you a definitive result but for now you can be positive. Whatever the outcome, you are being monitored. Keep all appointments you are given. I am sure as you haven't already been given a biopsy  and a doctor did the ultrasound, the cyst scenario is the most likely. I wish you well and continue to be encouraged that in the worse case, early detection is the key to successful treatment here. Have a lovely Sunday. I see you have warmer weather in the UK than I have here in SW France! Love Karen",

However, after one weeks delay and another blood test, I was allowed to continue. When we checked the results at home we realised that I was only just on the right side of the limit! Obviously everyone is different but in general I was told the cells drop lowest between days 10 and 15 and rebuild( usually) after day 15. How fast they rebuild depends on the individual. I have had a course of injections during days 1-5 this time to help keep them higher. I also read that a few foods, notably kale and broccoli, almond milk, almonds and dried figs can help promote cell growth too. I ate and drank them all but can't tell you if  they helped or if it was just the extra time that caused the necessary increase. In terms of being more susceptible to infection, I was just careful but not paranoid and caught nothing. I avoided groups, queues and crowds. I washed my hands regularly and particularly in public toilets and I tried to keep away from public toilet door handles and taps. In a cafe, we just chose a quieter corner to sit and as I live abroad, no kisses!",

      "Content": "Hi,  The mouthwash I was given was dilute Bicarbonate of soda.I'm not sure if salt would do the same but the bicarb certainly worked well. I started it on Day 1 , 3 to 4 times a day and carried on until the prescription was finished about 6 weeks after chemo but, coincidence or not, I didn't have any mouth/ throat problems. I think bicarb might taste better than salt but whatever you use, make sure its alcohol free. My nails have been good too. I used 2 coates of evo nail every day for 7 days, removed with acetone free remover, rubbed argan oil into cuticles overnight and started the cycle again the next morning. Unfortnately I probably should have carried on a few weeks longer because although I had had my last chemo, a hand problem prevented continuation. I suspect another 2 months and the nails would have been perfect. As it was, I got just a few small ridges just after I stopped using the evo nail but I kept the nails very short so they didn't flake and now six months on they are stronger than before. If you are not using a cold cap, now is the time to buy some pretty turbans. Bamboo is the best material. I had a bamboo skull cap I wore under the prettier synthetic ones. I had colours to match my outfits. For the plain cotton turbans which were comfy, I bought cheap headbands from Claires and online. I had a fun choosing bands to match blouses and dresses. The serious reason I recommend having something ready is that having your head shaved is hard. It changes your appearance totally and although for most of us, the shaving is actually a relief, both physically because the hair pulls as it starts to fall out but also emotionally because suddenly that unknown hurdle has been crossed and somehow the reality of the cancer hits home. Having something new and attractive to put on, is good for your morale. If you are not creative choose the ready formed turbans instead of scarves that need tying. There are turbans in every price range. If you shop online check delivery dates. There may still be time to order cheap ones from China but they do take about a month to arrive. Some of the French and English companies specialising in headware for cancer patients delivered overnight. I found even strangers admired mine when I went into town. No one ever commented on my hair! ( And actually my hair is now growing back nicely. Everyone is complimenting the short look. I may keep it for a few months) The beautician at the chemo clinic also recommended argan or almond oil to rub into the scalp and a paraben free shampoo but not baby products as these contain something else to help with a babies developing scalp which is not so good for us. It was interesting. I did use all the advise I was given and also later with the radiotherapy I followed the instructions to the letter and had no problems . You cannot eliminate the way your body will react to the chemo drugs( and I did have some severe reactions which lots of people don't get) but these are areas where you can take control and I didn't have any problems by following these simple regimes. Hope all goes well for you. Let us know how you are feeling after the 11th. There may be other tips that those of us whose treatment is finished can share but we'll wait and see how you react before we bombard with hopefully unnecessary info because lots are lucky and hardly react at all.  Take care.

      "Content": "I am very interested in the ages of the members of your family who have had breast cancer because it matches with mine and also something my specialist told me. My family history is slightly complicated by the fact it runs on the paternal side and whilst the breast specialist and oncologist were very interested here in France this was totally dismissed in the UK. ( see later)  My paternal grandmother had her breast removed during her late 60's. She then continued to live another 15 years. Her sister was not so lucky. With no screening back in the 60's and 70's she had found her lump too late and died.  I am now 63 but my tumour was detected by mammogram last october when I was 62. My paternal cousin( we have the same grandmother) was slightly less fortunate as it was her first mammogram which found a larger tumour and she needed a mastectomy whereas mine was early enough for the lumpectomy. None of us have had lymph involvement. My specialist was very interested in this because he says new and early research is beginning to show that some woman post menopause are producing a hormone which may be linked to breast cancers. If this is proven, heredity patterns would certainly be viable. He thought it irrelevant whether it was paternal or maternal in this situation if a significant number of the same family were showing similar symptoms just like your family Annie. I have a sister aged 59. She spoke to her GP who saw the relevance of a more frequent screening than 3 yearly. Here in France its every 2 years anyway.However, when he referred her the idea of a paternal link was poo -pood. They will only screen younger women who show the other link and only on the maternal side. This is slightly worrying for my sister as she has both a daughter and a granddaughter. Hopefully as the trend in our family is post menopause reseach will have become more established by the time they need it. But I thought this might interest you Annie as it does look as you have this later pattern and I wonder how many other slightly older breast cancer sufferers can trace similar links. It does show how important the screening scheme has become as it can find very small tumours before they have time to spread. Hope all progresses well for you Annie. Love Karen",

In addition to the numbness, I have lost the skin from my feet 3 times since April. But each time its been a bit less painful and the skinning less severe. My hands started to improve as soon as I finished chemo. I know everyone is different but if you look at the comments, Kacang's hands are improving and my feet are too. No one has said.......I'm 3 years on and I still can't walk .........so lets be really hopeful here, little by little things do improve.  I also think that the way you feel depressed this week is also really normal. I have been quite weepy since I knew all my treatment was finished. Before that, apart from the odd wimpish terror, I had been very together. Then I read two or three other members here saying the same thing. Very reassuring and logical really. Our bodies have been through enormous trauma. We've killed off practically every cell and those that survived we've zapped with radiotherapy. We've changed our body shape and emotionally we've run the biggest rollar coaster ride in existence. It doesn't matter that we're arriving in a new place, the past trauma has to catch up and be dealt with first. I think in some walks of life, it gets labelled Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and people get help to get over it. But we were only very sick and therefore the expectation is that we can get over this and we will.......but if it takes a few tears on the way, so be it. A few days self indulgence doesn't  do anyone any harm. I hope you will start to feel better soon. I'm sure your hands will improve with time and don't worry about the tears, you are right when you say you've had enough but the 'enough' is giving you back your life and a few months from now,today will be a distant memory!

I was given a local anesthetic patch to put over it, one hour before I went into the clinic so I never felt anything. I did have reactions to the actual drugs but that was just me and I'm sure nothing to do with the port. I had seen a cardiologist before they started chemo who said my heart was fine and I don't think the chemo ever affected it. I think you will probably be pleased you have the port when you discover how easy taking the chemo is with it. Having finished my treatment mid July, I had my port removed 3 weeks ago.

      "Content": "I went through several days feeling like you after my third Fec dose when I had been particularly sick for 5 days. Why is all this extra disconfort necessary? Couldn't I just take a chance on the future? But Julia is so right. These few months are such a small part of our lives. Common sense must tell us that any doctor who suggests chemo is necessary, believes that it is. No one would recommend something like this otherwise. And a few days later, when I felt stronger again, keeping going really was the only option. Today I am having a few problems with taxotere but the sun is shining, I might manage to sit outside in a while. The tulips look beautiful and every day passing is a day nearer to saying 'I did everything possible to make sure I can continue to enjoy life' Once you start your chemo, you will be able to start your count down to that day as well. I will be thinking of you tomorrow. Love Karen",

Whilst of course you will read of those who were not lucky, many, many more have had this treatment and are not online because they are well and they are getting back to living. The you who was fit and well a month or so ago, will be back in a while. I had to have the same treatment you have been recommended. I won't pretend it was easy.....I had a lot of side effects.....but I  followed the advice I was given to make them as manageable as possible and always remembered that the operation had removed the cancer. Here I am exactly three years to the day from the op with a clear mammogram and ultrasound. Take a deep breath.....and it will be over. I hope all goes as well as it can. Some people have very few side effects so you may be lucky but if not......it will finish and you should have your life back. Love Karen",

      "Content": "Hi, I was told, just like Kacang,  to expect it take 2 years before I would feel relatively normal again!  That isn't to say that gradually I have more energy, less episodes of real fatigue where I have to stop what I'm doing and more satisfaction from what I achieve. But I do still get tired and don't always have enthusiasm to start things. I think some of the continuing aches and pains may influence that.  I am retired and of course, some of this response maybe age related and I am certainly pleased that I didn't have to make the decision about returning to work. But I also know from reading on this site that recovery is as individual as reactions to the medications. There are many ladies( and a few men) who find that they are fit enough to return working, even during chemo or radiotherapy. I think the important thing is to recognise your own recovery rate and work with it. If you're too tired to work, don't consider it. If you can, and it's good for your own morale, go back. Whatever you choose, don't feel guilty and don't compare yourself to anyone else.  With respect to hair and nails. My nails flaked towards the end but I think the evo nail protection helped me keep most of the possible problems to a minImum and they are now stronger and a nicer shape. I can wear nail varnish now which I hadn't done for years. I  lost all my hair 14 days into chemo. ( Well, it was coming out in handfuls and my husband shaved it to ease the pain.) This was January 2016. It didn't start to regrow until mid August and I had completed both chemo and radiotherapy by then. It was slower than some, as the ladies I met daily for radiotherapy, had hair growing well at that time. But it has returned now. It's in very good condition. More body and albeit grey, not blonde as before, it's very pretty ( salt and pepper shades) and seems to suit me. Lots more compliments these days. The best day was back in January, exactly one year to the day it was shaved off, I went and had it cut. It seemed significant somehow. Closure on a difficult year which has given me back my life for the present. Aches and pains are insignificant in relation to that! I wish you and the other ladies, a full and healthy recovery over the next few months. Take time if you need it. Do what is right for you and it will get better! Love Karen",

They are standard in many hospitals here but I do know other UK ladies have been offered them because they have been discussed. It differs from the pic line in that you have nothing that can get caught or pulled out in your sleep. I can really sympathise with your veins because this year after an operation I had a complication which resulted in intravenous antibiotics for eight days. These were so painful as they kept blocking and I had seven sites before an anesthetist put in a deep line. I remember thinking then how awful chemo would have been directly into a vein......... Hope you get something sorted soon so you only have to deal with the sickness and not the anxiety. It will pass and despite all you still have in front of you, it will not be that long before you can look back like me and say' I got there!'",

Everyone has them for every type of cancer but I think, reading other members comments on this site, it is well worth considering if you are offered one. Firstly there is no pain during connection. Secondly, if there is a scar in the future (and I am doubting there will be because mine which was fitted on Dec 22nd has already faded to nothing) it is very small. I am given a local anesthetic patch to put over the port one hour before each chemo dose. My port was fitted under general anesthetic. I can't imagine its different in the UK. Hope that bit of info helps and doesn't worry you too much. As someone already said, do talk this over with the people who are  there to advise you. I have been so lucky as both my surgeon and oncologist have always given me clear explanations as to what is going on and what will happen next but I have still needed the reassurances from other members on this site, that everything is progressing as expected. I wish you well over the next few months and remember every confusing day,  is one day nearer to recovery.",

I was also told that as I have each forthcoming appointment, a new one will be made for 12 months later to allow a continuation of checks every 3 months. But like you, its this first mammogram I want to get done so desperately to be sure in my mind everything is clear. I have been told to make the appointment for the beginning of December but I am very tempted to try for mid November at least. Surely you won't have to wait 12 months?  I know all health authorities are different but that seems very unfair in the circumstances. Is there someone you could ring to ask about it? Do you have to wait until you are sent an appointment? If so, could you afford a private one, just for your peace of mind? Maybe you could chat to your GP? Afterall its not good for your overall recovery to worry for another year. I'm sure you'll get lots of other good advise in the morning from other's who have been in this situation but I wanted you know that I feel the same.........I need to know that all the unpleasant treatments from the last twelve months have been worth it. I don't know how you feel in yourself but I still have mobility problems courtesy of the Taxotere and fatigue regularly hits me like a brick! I'm sure everything will be fine for you and wish you a long and contented future. Love Karen",

I am also having the 5 injections for the white cells as 3 times before my chemo had to be delayed. They are fine. They don't hurt at all. The syringe has a very fine needle and they worked. My last chemo dose was given on schedule. A nurse would come to the house to give them but my husband is an insulin dependant diabetic of over 30 years so the oncologist gave him the job. It must be very worrying having things changing all the time but it would probably be more worrying if things had been left as they were because at least you know you're being given every possible chance of recovery.

      "Content": "Hi Always, I've just been away for holiday. It was 6 weeks since I finished radiotherapy and four months since chemo. I thought it would be nice to have a break and some 'us' time with my husband. It was nice but it took us a few days to realise how different I was. There was no way I could spend hours sightseeing or exploring. Everything had to be done in short bursts. Almost cafe to cafe! I found I couldn't walk around a market or enjoy a shopping street........no energy. We drove out a bit but in the end adapted our break so we went out early in the mornings when I had more energy after a night's sleep, I rested in the afternoons and than we went out in the evenings. I felt terrible at first because I felt I was spoiling my husband's holiday. I expect other people cope better but I was surprised how different I was. Before we left, when I was at home, I thought I'd be fine. We didn't need to fly as I live in France and we drove to Italy. Kacang is right when she says you will need to get over your last chemo too. I couldn't have travelled between chemo and radiotherapy but I did have a complication with my feet. The pain in my legs also caused a problem in Italy. However, only you know how you react to the treatments. If you think you will be well and your doctor is happy, and you can get insurance for flying, go for it!   If you can't get to Ireland, what about Wales or the Lake District or a city break? Hope all sorts itself out. Love Karen",

Its been a good Autumn weatherwise hasn't it but I hope you missed the recent heavy rain which I noticed along the Med. We caught the beautiful weather that stretched northwards from Biarritz so we're not complaining.  Have you looked in your local supermarket for beauty products? I found some very nice ones. Timotei has a paraben free shampoo, equivalent to a 'simple' variety and Apres Shampoo to match at under 3\u20ac a bottle and actually I bought a Lot of 2 for 4\u20ac. The newest one, again Paraben free,  has Oil of Argan and almond oil in, both of which I was recommended for my dry scalp at the chemo clinic by the beautician. I mix them up, one one day , one the next. Seems to be working well.My hair looks really shiny using it and its very soft. Lots of compliments and I have rechecked tonight, especially for this reply, it contains nothing sinister. For the shower, Dove has produced a new shower product in the last few months too , perfect for us. It contains 'savon surgras'. Its creamy and smells lovely although it doesn't contain perfume. Again its inexpensive so perfect for everyday and my skin is good. Not too dry and scaly as it was beginning to get during taxotere. I haven't looked at hair colour and probably won't bother because I'm 64 next week. My hair was still blonde when I started chemo but its come back a 'salt and peper' silver grey. It will do! Obviously it will be interesting to see what is available in Boots but I don't think you need panic if you can't carry as much you hoped. There is plenty here! On a different note I am meeting Bougiecat for coffee on Friday. We had to cancel last time because of an unexpected complication so I'm looking forward to that.  Have a good trip to the UK. Hope all continues well for you. Love Karen P.S. Think of me Thursday......I have my control mammogram for the first time. A little scared as you can imagine. Yours can't be far away either?",

      "Content": "Sorry, you were on your own this morning. There's often someone else up in the middle of the night......how typical we've all had a good night's sleep, when you needed us!  But I'm up now........usually an early riser me. You mustn't worry about having some ' why me?' time.....we've all been there I'm sure. Cancer is terrifying.......we all know there's a chance, we won't survive it. The world out there has an expectation that we will be positive. We will be ok......but that's because they need us to survive because they don't want to have to deal with the opposite. Because of this, we have so much pressure to be up beat and determined that we feel guilty when reality hits home. I'm sorry you were on your own but actually whether it was the middle of the night or middle of the afternoon, I think we're usually on our own when the fears and tears effect us the most.Even when like me, you have a really supportive partner, there are times when you can't share exactly what you're feeling either because they can't understand or because we don't really want them to have to.That's why this site is so important. As people begin to wake up shortly, I expect you will get so many replies from other's who can empathise with you totally. I didn't see the programme that upset you but I suppose its a necessary story line. If the character doesn't survive, it will remind the viewers that despite all the progress in treatments, the treatments do not always succeed. Having said that, we're still in a very good place. The treatments are so much better now than they were even 10 years ago. We do have a really good chance of successful recovery.  Look at your own situation. I know its difficult to have to go back as your margins weren't clear and do the lumpectomy again but I suspect a few years ago, those unhealthy cells would have gone undetected. Then the cancer would have had a chance to spread. Of course you are worried. This extra complication is delaying, the next step. You just want to get on with the treatment so that you get nearer to returning to your old life. The tears were just normal. There's nothing selfish or self centred in that! Your body is probably still shocked from the original diagnosis. Everything happens so quickly. I expect less than 2 months ago, you had no idea you might be in this situation. I'm not going to say 'snap out of this and look on the bright side etc etc........'  There is plenty of hope for your future but there is also the scenario you saw on tv. Whilst we stand every chance that everything will be fine,  and we have to allow our families and friends to believe that......we can allow ourselves a bit of realism from time to time......it may not. However, once we've had a good cry, it is better for ourselves if we can stay positive. There's still a long way to go in the treatment plan before you really need to get despondent. At the moment, I am cancer free. The treatment has done its job. You have to hold onto that........the next op is likely to leave you cancer free too. The chemo and radiotherapy you may have to have should stop it returniing. There will sadly always be people in the situation of your tv character( and remember she's probably got another job to be moving onto so she can't recover!) but they are becoming less and less.....and it's not going to be you!I'm hoping yyou're not still up and have managed some sleep now. Take care today. It's going to be ok! Love Karen",

      "Content": "I thought I would just tell you about a very comfortable find I had last week. Our local hairdresser has started stocking hats, wigs and turbans for patients with hair loss. She has made a private room available too with a proper mirror so things can be tried on without embarrassment and I thought that was particularly sensitive but the find........she produced a little fitted cap made out of bamboo to wear underneath any hat,wig, or turban. Perhaps some of you already have them but I didn't? What a difference it makes. It is a natural fibre and therefore breathable. It doesn't get hot or sweaty and therefore go cold and wet either. It is warm or cool depending on the temperature and it doesn't seem to change its qualities regardless of whether the hat on top is a synthetic turban or a wool hat. I don't have a wig but I am sure it would also make one much more comfortable. It wasn't cheap but it was an investment.  I have noticed in discussions some new chemo patients are particularly anxious about hair loss so I thought they might be interested in this discovery. We have enough things to worry about during chemo, don't we? Actually I bought a collection of different coloured and patterned turbans, very inexpensive, from the internet and they have been a huge success. They are admired everywhere I go and often by total strangers so if you are worried about losing your hair as you start chemo, my advice is , don't be. The more normal we make the alternatives, the easier it will be for everyone who follows on. And back to the bamboo cap........I shall be getting a second one next time I go into town so I don't have to wait for it dry after washing!",

The type you climb into like knickers! They were extremely comfortable and supportive at night. Afterwards I bought front fastening because I found they made examinations much easier and getting ready for radiotherapy was very quick. I shall continue to wear the front opening for all appointments when my breast needs examination. For other days, I am wearing normal styles but have avoided under wiring. At my age, not many people see the bra but I might feel like trying something more shapely if I was 20 years younger. Hope all continues well for you. Treatment finished I am just a few weeks away from my first control mammogram. A little scary as anticipation grows....... Love Karen",

      "Content": "My menopause happened 10 years before my breast cancer around 2003/ 2005.  The nights sweats  came and went thoughout that time so I think what you're experiencing now, you might have had anyway. However, as the years progressed I seemed to be getting worse, not better. I just assumed that was what could happen but then I was sent to a pneumologue for something unrelated and after listening to my breathing, he ordered a sleep test. He had asked me if I got hot at night and if I was restless. The sleep test showed that although I didn't stop breathing while I was asleep as in normally recognised sleep apnea, I was breathing too swallowly and not getting enough oxygen. He ordered a machine for me to breathe through at night. The sweats disappeared! Don't blame everything on the hormone treatments. There maybe another explanation. Love Karen",

      "Content": "Hi worried, I live an hour from the radiotherapy unit. I used to put my cream on as soon as I got home. It wasn't R1/R2 as in France we are given 100% hylaronic cream but its still excellent. I used that twice a day. I was also given hydra plat squares to use on any areas which did burn but didn't need to open the box. The essential thing is to remove all cream before you go for the next session. Good creams don't all soak away. They are there to keep the skin moisterised so you need a really good, perfume free soap ( very important or you will be putting other chemicals back onto the skin.) In France we have a product called savon surgras but I can't think what the English equivalent would be. I had 33 sessions of radiotherapy with no burns but more importantly, none of the other ladies who regularly waited with me, did either. I hope you get started soon Worried. It will be good to get these treatments out of the way and you can get back to living! Take care. Love Karen",

      "Content": "Hi,  Sounds as if you might hopefully be over the worst for the first dose. Are you using a mouth wash? My pharmacy told me to use it 3 or 4 times a day from Day 1. It was prescribed but was only 100% dilute bicarbonate of soda. I know it could have been coincidence but I didn't get a single mouth or throat problem. Later on, if I felt any slight mouth sensations, I added extra washes. Pharmacist said 9 or 10 a day are ok provided you use a non alcohol based wash. I was very sick too. Whilst it is important to discuss it with your nurse or onco and take good anti sickness drugs, prepare yourself for the fact, they might not work for you. Hopefully you'll be lucky and they will but if they don't, unfortunately its just one of those things and at the time, its quite depressing but you know, the eighteen weeks or so do pass. You will find yourself, like I am today, writing back to another newcomer, giving out your tips and clear from cancer, much sooner than you can imagine at the moment! Good luck and take care.

      "Content": "Hi Sarah, Sorry to meet you here but I am so glad you found this site at the beginning of your treatment. I didn't find it for several months and had to deal with a number of difficult questions and experiences on my own. Since I found it, the help has been invaluable. I can't give you any help with the 'How to tell your small children' scenario as my own problem was dealing with a 90 year old but I do know from teaching that children are resiliant. They deal with the truth much better than adults who fantasise around the facts and panic! I would imagine that if you tell your children you have a lump which is going to make you very ill unless the doctors take it away in hospital. Unfortunately to take it away properly you may have some sickness and pain for a few months but afterwards you will be better. Most children will understand that. Also I can't imagine they haven't seen at least one advert on tv showing how cancer research has saved lives. They often show someone very sick, gradually recovering. Perhaps you could use one of these as a talking point to show them you might be a bit like this but look how normal everything is in the end? I don't think I would try to hide what is happening from the 10 year old.  I think they might like the responsibilty of being included and being able to get things for you and help with the younger ones. At 10 I don't think thoughts of dying will be their first reaction. I think probably in that respect 15 - 20 year olds might be harder to convince you are going to be alright. I hope all goes well. I hope you are not on your own with the children as I imagine you will need some recovery time. A difficult few months ahead but lets be positive, you are going to be treated, you are on the way to recovery and a future. If it was still undetected......who knows? Love Karen",

Its confusing enough to have this illness as a female when there is so much help and advice from other sufferers that it must be really difficult when you're in a minority. I am however, triple negative which must be the same so I understand your concerns there but I was lucky and a mammogram found my tumour before it spread to the lymph nodes.

      "Content": "Hi,  I had a TEP scan .....(sorry slip of the language. Its the same scan words rearranged in French) It is the most thorough scan for showing cancer anywhere else in the body. If its clear, its extremely reassuring. If something shows up...the oncologists know exactly what areas they are dealing with, which is I expect why your oncologist has put a hold on your chemo in case she has to add on some extra treatment. The actual scan is lengthy but not painful. I expect it will be the same for you. You need to drink plenty of water before it begins. You will be given a radioactive drip and then you have to sit very quietly and still for an hour. I was a little aprehensive about that but the chair was designed to shaped around my most comfortable positions for back body and legs. The arm with the drip had a very soft , pillow like structure to rest on.  After the hour I then had to change into a gown and was taken to the scanner. It is enclosed but it was comfortable. It does take about 40 mins but my onco had told me to close my eyes and dose. You are connected to the technicians through microphones and they did bring me back and forward into the room. The scanner was air conditioned so it was cool rather than too hot. It was much more acceptable than the last MRI scan I had. I hope having a bit of information helps. After you may have to wait a bit while they check the results are clear. They probably won't tell you the result because obviously the aim of the scan is to detect cancer early so they leave discussion of the findings to your oncologue. Hope all goes well and its nothing too serious. Love Karen",
