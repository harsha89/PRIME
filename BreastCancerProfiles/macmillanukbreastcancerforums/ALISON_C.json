    "Content": "I have endometriosis and although I had an op to remove it still have issues. In July I was diagnosed with breast cancer. I had the lump removed and I am nearly at the end of radiotherapy. I have to take tamoxifen but have found it has agravated my endometriosis to the point I am on the verge of stopping the tamoxifen. Is there anyone out there with the same conditions and taking tamoxifen and if so how does it effect you?",
