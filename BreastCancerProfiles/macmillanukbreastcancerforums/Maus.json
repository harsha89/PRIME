    "Content": "I'm in a similar position just with ovarian cancer. Had optimal debulking surgery which found widespread borderline tumors (ovaries, rectum, omentum, peritoneum etc) of which a small part (in the ovaries) had turned into an invasive, low grade serous carcinoma. My UK oncologist said standard chemo won't do anything to the borderline cells if any are left . Google suggests response rate of low grade serous OC to chemo is also very low i.e. 2-4%. Low grade cells, which is apparently a small minority of ovarian cancers, grow slowly but essentially can only be tackled by repeat surgery or possibly hormone therapy or brandnew MEK inhibitors (trials still ongoing). They grow slowly but when they recur, treatment options are seemingly very limited. Trust me to pick up the special kind of disease for no extra costs! With or without chemo I'm looking at an indefinite quarterly checkup routine. My UK oncologist supports a choice of chemo, more for peace of mind than for scientific reasons. The  onc gyn surgeon back in Germany recommended standard chemo anyway, to be sure. I believe treatment guidelines do currently not distinguish between low and high grade OC types but not sure. So I'm undergoing a couple of standard tests/scans here in the UK this week and will meet again with my oncologist next Monday to confirm what his final assessment is regarding the chance of chemo influencing the recurrence/survival rate with this particular kind of cancer, and then it's decision time. Honestly I don't know yet whether I'll go for chemo or not. If the oncologist confirms that the response rate remains <5%, I might not do it and 'save' the chemo option for possible recurrence, if deemed suitable then. Or I'll go for the first cycle anyway and as long as side effects appear manageable, pull through it in order to take my 2-4% improvement chance. And if side effects are horrible/unbearable, I'll drop out of chemo. If the latest tests indicate any additional factors that would suggest increased/definitive benefits to be had from chemo or increased/new disease spread/impact in my body which requires chemo anyway,  I 'll probably go for it, no questions asked. Keep the posts coming please. It's really helpful just to see what other folks in a similar situation decided although ofc everyone's cancer is different and there are no guarantees. I applaud you making a decision. That's more than I have managed , so far :) P.S. I'm 46 and will probably try scalp cooling if I can stand the pain and decide for chemo.",
