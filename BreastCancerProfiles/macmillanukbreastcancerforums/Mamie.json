      "Content": "Hi I went to the Dr as I have a lump in my arm pit. He said it was probably nothing to worry about and sent me away for a month. But the lump just stayed. My bones started hurting at night and my liver twinges so I went back to another Dr after 3 weeks. She did a breast examination and looked grave. I have started losing weight and look pale. She sent me to have a chest x ray and full bloods on the same day. Two days later I got a phone call from the BC offering me an appointment this Monday , i.e.within two days. I think I have stage 4 and stuff in liver and legs. I have told my wonderful husband and he will come with me to the breast clinic. I am so frightened I can't sleep at nights and I can't eat. I feel tearful and shaky. I know that they will find BC as the Dr said some stuff like, \"We'll get an action plan together for you, \" and \"I will have a conference about you with the Drs,\" and \"I didn't find anything yuk but you must understand you have a swollen lymph node with no illness on the outside and I don't want you to get a shock about this or be surprised.\" So I know she expects BC. The lump could have been there for years for all I know so I feel that the pains in my liver and bones means it has spread. I am so frightened  I don't know how I will manage to wait until 3.10 on Monday and I don't know how I will manage to even walk into the clinic. I feel ashamed that I didn't notice the swollen lymph node earlier. I feel ashamed that I have let myself. Mamie  ",
