    "Content": "Hi, I've just had my 5th TAC chemo and am now sorting out my radiotherapy treatment. I had a lumpectomy for a 14mm lump and also lymph node removal, 1 affected out of 20 removed. I will beÂ having radiotherapy on the breast, every other day (exc weekends) for 6 weeks, starting about 4 weeks after my final chemo. I live in Worcester - chemo takes place here, but radio is in Cheltenham. Hope you get a good answer Wend",
