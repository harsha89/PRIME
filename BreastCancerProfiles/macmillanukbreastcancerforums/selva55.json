    "Content": "Hi, I had reconstruction to the left breast from my tummy last November. I had some muscle removed and mesh inserted.This is my experience so far. I was able to stand upright the day after the surgery although I wasn't expecting to and yes tummy felt very, very tight but was ok. I felt I was doing really well until I found that after a few days my breast and armpit began to really hurt (they took away 4 lymph nodes). This was due to 'cording' which I knew nothing about or expected, not everybody suffers with it.This gradually became  very, very painful as it stretched down from my left wrist to under my new breast like a tight elastic band.. I found it very difficult to sleep at night even after taking all the painkillers prescribed. I worked through my exercises  in the booklet every day despite the pain and persevered.After about 6 weeks it eased a little . I found this to be the worst thing of all for me putting aside all the things that go along with such a major op, drains, catheter etc., 8 weeks on the cording is now at a stage where it is not painful just tight. I am now in a good place. Looking back I would say  you need to give yourself at least 6 weeks after the op, be kind to yourself,  take it really easy which I found hard as I am normally such an active person. I did way too much and some days my tummy used to really ache and feel very swollen. You don't realise how much you use your tummy muscles just to lift a kettle, walk up the stairs! So, my new breast is fuller than my other one which means when I have my new nipple reconstructed (about april time) it will be higher than the other one, no big deal. I don't want to go through further surgery for either liposuction to new breast or lipofill to other breast as has been offered as this will mean I will have to go back for the nipple reconstruction at a later date. The plastic surgeon says they will not do surgery to either breast and nipple reconstruction at the same time. My tight tummy and new breast have felt weird which I presume is quite normal but I am gradually getting used to it/them.The only other small amount of surgery I will want is to my abdomen. I have a small pronounced raised area/bulge to the right along my scar/ tummy and they say they can do a little liposuction at the same time as nipple surgery. I haven't quite found out why this has occurred. Maybe where they have taken muscle and inserted mesh? No answers as yet. After spending so long stressing after being diagnosed with dcis and about the right option for me, I believe I chose the right one. Yes it is a major operation and recovery time is different for everyone but I have no regrets. You will need to wear a front opening nightie and  buy a cheap good supporting bra as they will cut out the nipple area to check the flap constantly for a good few days after surgery. Sending you best wishes for a speedy recovery from your surgery. I was terrified as previous ladies have stated but got through it and out the other side just can't wait now for my new nipple and tattoo!",
