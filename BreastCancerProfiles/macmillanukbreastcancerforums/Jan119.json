Worse time was days 3 and 4 after chemo when I just curled up in a corner really, night sweats, hot flushes and cold sweats. Started feeling better during Monday (day 5) not great, but better. So Lee, chin up, we'll all get through it. Love and hugs xxx",

Now had a cancerous lump in armpit same side, and two tumours between implant and skin, had implant out and rest of lymph nodes out, 11 out of 17 cancerous cells, I'm having 6 sessions of FEC-T. had 3rd round last wed, now it's docetaxol for the next 3. Then radiotherapy then meds. As like you I've been told it hasn't spread anywhere else. How far have you got with your treatment at the moment? Keep strong xxx",

Going through chemo at mo, be positive as much as you can, we can all get through this, it may be tough but we can do it, it's so sad about your mum ❤️.

Two days ago I woke up and couldn't touch my head, it was so tender, since then my hair has been coming out, could make a nice bristle paintbrush with it if I save it up lol. Today's hair loss worse than yesterday, just wondering if it's going to be on the pillow in the morning instead of my head. I was so prepared for it, wig got, hats got, but now it's actually happening I'm not so confident. Went shopping today, just hoping none of it dropped in anyone else's trolley After waffling on, I'm sorry I can't answer your question as to how long it goes on for, cos I'm only a couple of days ahead of you, but I can sympathise with you. Take care xxx",

The nurse there did say, basically, after approx a year having surgery,chemo and radio, it takes about 18 months to 2 years to get back to \u201cnormal\u201d. So ladies, I think we\u2019ve just got to be patient, although it\u2019s so annoying feeling ugh most of the time. Love and hugs to all of you xxx",
