      "Content": "Hello Can't sleep again as so scared for tomorrow. My GP referred me 2 weeks ago after I complained of breast pain and after examination she discovered a lumpy mass. I've had the pain for about 3-4 months but just thought it would go away. But no...so here I am!  I'm 40 and have 3 sons and the thought of them growing up without their mum kills me. It sounds dramatic but I can't help think of the worst case scenario and I've not been able to sleep or eat or think properly. I'm going out of my mind with worry. Apparently it's a one stop clinic and I will have a mammogram, ultra sound and a possible biopsy. I'm hoping I will get the results the same day. Does anyone know? I've read the biopsy results may take a week. Anyway....fingers crossed it's nothing serious ",

      "Content": "Hi Julio I had the same symptoms, lumps and tenderness, especially on one side. I had to wait for 2 weeks and it was a horrible wait, it's hard not to think of the worst case scenario isn't it?! I had an examination and the consultant told me she didn't think she could feel anything to be worried about but recommended I have the mammogram and ultrasound just to make sure. I had these as suggested and fortunately my results were clear...I've just got fibrous, lumpy boobs!!!  I hope you are ok, keep busy while you wait otherwise you have too much time to overthink.  I wish you all the the best...let me know how you get on. Goodluck girl xxx",
