    "Content": "My long term partner of 16 yrs ,Valerie , was diagnosed 5 weeks ago with TNBC. Prognosis is good , considering it's TN , as it was caught very early. Valerie is  now post surgery and 2 days into FEC-100 Chemo. She  is a rock and now i'm going to sound selfish --- I'm struggling !!!!! I ended up in hospital 2 weeks after the diagnosis with a serious Panic/Anxiety attack. Since then i'm not the man I thought I was ---just yesterday we had to visit the cancer centre for her wig --- Boom another attack were upon it's her who has to help me. Considering the long haul ahead is there anyone out there has suffered the same thing and can offer advise. I soo want to be her rock but , tears now welling up, I just cant seem to function.   Mark",
