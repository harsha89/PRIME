      "Content": "Hi Alison, sorry to hear you are feeling sick :(  I was prescribed EMEND for the first 3 days after every treatment and it really helped.  I struggled to drink anything fizzy and even couldn't stand the taste of squash.  I started drinking lots of ice cold milk and flavoured it with strawberry Nesquick.  Couldn't even drink my normal cuppa.  I really hope that things get better for you soon xx",

      "Content": "Hi Ronstar, know how you feel. I thought that they would have taken my line out after my last chemo but they didn't. I went for a check up 3 weeks later and they still wouldn't take it out. I was so disappointed that I took it out myself 2 days later at home. Very naughty I know, but i wanted the chemo stage over and try and start feeling normal again xx hi",
