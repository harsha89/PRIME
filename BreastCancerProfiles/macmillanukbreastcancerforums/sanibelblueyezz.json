My husband finally quit but still chews Nicorette which to me is if he stops chewing it he will start up again. I sent him outside while he smoked. Please keep trying. I have bc wit mets.

      "Content": "Hi Louise, what does your age have to do with if you get chemo or not.  I am 58 and just now getting it. There was no question about my age.  I had a lumpectomy in 2004 with 100% node clearance.  I had had 5 wks. of radiation only.  I never saw an oncologist; only a radiologist.  In 2007 I had a recurrence with stage IV breast cancer.  I had had only a 1% chance of recurrence.  It runs highly in my family so I was not surprised. I was on Tamoxifen and Femara for a year each.  It has spread to my lung now and the time came to start chemo.  All the thoughts that went through my head for a time being was why had it come back.  There are no answers.  But my thinking is if I had had chemotherapy it may have killed the stray mutant cell and I wouldn't be in this situation now. It's a lot to think about and very scary but I just had my 7th round and I'm doing fine.  Don't mean to scare you but it's just a thought.  Good luck with your decision.  Ask lots of question.   Marilyn",

You just lay there & it's an open machine & it starts at one end & scans you from head to toe on top & then on the backside of you. The unknown is always scary. I've done it all do I don't freak out anymore. If someone is going to drive you you could take a Lorazapam ahead of time to calm your nerves.

      "Content": "Hi Annibel, is your chest infection pneumonia? I went the the clinic once in such bad shape they had to wheel me in a wheelchair. It was pneumonia that I didn't know how sick I was until being so weak. That time they gave me fluids & heavy duty antibiotics. The next time I got pneumonia I ended up in the hosp. On heart monitors & oxygen. I've now had a chest cold for over 2 wks. The cough will not go away. We are just so much more susceptible to germs & it hits us harder & it's harder to feel better. I'm sorry you had to miss your little ones school activities but you need to take care & rest & get better. I'm sure you will! Sending healing thoughts your way. Marilyn xx",

My son & husband are out fishing & here I sit eating cold pizza. I am now on xeloda & it has really taken my appetite away & I am weak from not eating. All I want to do is sleep.,I did not get out if bed until 1 & then I didn't even want to move. It's one thing to have bc but to have to take these meds with so many side effects is so depressing. I have so much to do but I can't get motivated to start anything. And on top of it all I have an aching tooth & of course it's the weekend! So I know how you feel my friend. I hope today is somewhat better for you. Hope you can get some things done now that your hubby is off. Peace. Marilyn xx",

I've been fine since that day.  We all go through it and we all understand and we're here for you.  I'm newer here and am very happy I found this site.  Here's a BIG CYBER HUG from me to you.  Hope you feel bettr soon.   Marilyn",

I've had it, this time, for over a wk. & I went for a chest X-ray today & they didn't want to risk it. If I'm still too weak & they give it to me It could make it worse & i could end up in the hosp. I return on fri. & if i'm better they will start it then. If not we can wait one more week. My husband has been wonderful through this all. Sunday he leaves for a wk. & he's thinking about canceling his trip. I want him to go because his 83 yr. old mom needs him more. Hope things work out for you next wk. take care...Marilyn",
