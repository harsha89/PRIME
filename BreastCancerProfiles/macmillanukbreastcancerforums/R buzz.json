I hope you reach your decision about treatment/reconstruction because i think you will feel more calm when you don't have all the inn indecision and stress going through your head. But your right we will beat this and get through the other side.  Take care and thanks for your messages x",

      "Content": "Hi R thanks so much for your reply, it really helps knowing other people have agonized over the same things cos at times I just thought I was going loopy! Like you say making big decisions when you feel vulnerable and scared already is really difficult.  Last week I felt so scared about the cancer and the future I was so sure I wanted both breasts removed, I couldn't even think there would be any other choice, now this week I couldn't think of anything so scary as removing a healthy breast! Because of my indecision I think I will opt for single, treat the known cancer I have and deal with my hang ups about the other one at a later date.  Thanks again so much for your advice. ",

      "Content": "Hi everyone I'm new to the site, I was diagnosed with DCIS in my right breast in August, they have found 2 separate areas & there are further widespread microcalcifications, so im having single mastectomy booked in for 19 Oct. After all the horrible decision making about reconstruction, once my op was booked in I felt so relieved.  However this last week I keep worrying about BC in my other breast, not just now but in future and I feel like I'm on that agonising journey of decision making again and wondering whether a bilateral mastectomy is right decision for me.  Has anyone else been in this situation? I'm finding the decision making the most stressful part of it all.  Thanks",

Anyway im having a silicone implant cos I don't have enough flesh anywhere else, I joined slimming world last year, for the first time in my life I've been too slim for something! Good luck with your decision making, just remember there is no right or wrong, and good luck with your surgery xx",
