      "Content": "Had my round two of fec this pm at home again and all gone ok just a little indigestion so taken my meds for that. Hope I feel as well as I did after first cycle. Haven't seen the onc this week as had to have this one delayed by a week due to low white cell blood count. Despite having my lumps tagged on Monday I must say they do feel a little softer. I know the chemo is working as my hair is on its very last legs and have resorted to wearing a hat when I walk the dogs or go out. I need to book my son to visit with his clippers this weekend as I am fed up with hoovering the bed and the floor! I must say I have never been a hat wearer so the family will have to get uSed to the naked truth. My wig is waiting on it's stand in the bedroom but feels very alien despite being a similar style although a little blonder. A bonus, my husband has decided to watch the footy with me rather than in the pub because of my treatment this afternoon! Long may we feel that things are working!! Jo",

Perhaps I was a little bit adventurous having a small portion of fish and chips on fridayevening it didnt last the night! Feel much better today and have manged to eat especially as my daughters cooked a very healthy lunch for me and my hubby (fathers day) still off the red wine and prefere weak orange squash. It's much better for me I know! Hope you are feeling better. Jo xx",

My dog disappears to the bottom of the garden if there are raised voices in the house but will be the first to nusel up and give you a cuddle if you are feeling upset. I am so glad I have had my dogs during chemo as they certainly make you go out, have fresh air and exercise which I don't think I would do if I didn't have them. They make a mess, smell and their water pot always gets in the way but I am sure you love them to bits! Jo Ps I did mean perceptive ....silly me not checking predictive text",

      "Content": "Hi Annie, Had my scan yesterday and my penultimate chemo today so in the same position as you as surgery to be organised at about Christmas time. I too have down times. This morning I woke up and flicked through the channels to find one of those adverts for CDs and one of the songs was Louis armstrong - what a wonderful life I immediately thought that would be good for my funeral but it didn't last. I switched channels and enjoyed watching one of my childhood favourites Little House on the Prairie. I couldn't do that if I was at work- a positive. Things are thrown at you everyday but I try not to dwell on the negatives until I know the facts. I will know about the shrinkage of my lumps in 3 weeks time when I see the onc before my last chemo. Until that time there is nothing I can do so nothing to worry about. Perhaps I am being an ostricih but that is how I cope. As I said we are all different because we all have different lives, different experiences and different ways of coping. Hope you feel more positive tomorrow. As people have suggested do something nice for you! Jo xxx",

I have 3 more T left as having 8 sessions of chemo before surgery like you. I will keep following your posts so keep posting. I Agee that animals are very special when you are not feeling too good. Taking my dogs for walks have really made me get up and get going and the cat and me have had some super afternoon snuggles on the sofa. I too have started thinking about the next stage. Jo",

      "Content": "I am a cycle in front of you and have my second session on Friday. I am having fec chemo at home and the nurse who came last time was super and really put me at my ease. While having my chemo and for a couple of days after I felt a little spaced out but managed all my usual activities including walking the dogs daily. I have had no real fatigue but as I am not working because I am a teacher I have done a lot of sitting about reading. It was hard to keep out,of the sun when the weather was so gorgeous. The only side effect was my mouth feels strange and my taste buds have changed. I was a red wine and beer drinker and now prefer weak orange squash which is alot more healthy! my hair has just begun to fall out and I am putting off washing it until the end of the week as I am sure I will end up with a few bare patches. I do know the effects are a bit cumulative but I have been so well. I hope your first chemo goes as well. Good luck",

Yes it does make your bones ache and your fingers nails go manky but it has also really worked on my lumps like it is supposed to. My first one was horrid but since they extended my steroids on a reduced dose for a couple of days the pains have been more manageable. I think I had a double whammy on the first one because as my steroids finished the neulasta jab pains and the tax pains kicked in at the same time. Hope things go well and as I said in the beginning I am sending you a huge hug Jo xxx",
