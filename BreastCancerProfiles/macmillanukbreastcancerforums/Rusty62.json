We all have our demons to face and only you can know what you want and what you feel is best for you. I have been told not to be bullied or pressured in to treatments, and to think about alternatives carefully before making that decision. It seems to me that you have done exactly that, so good on you. We all need to know that you will be around to listen to us and comfort us, so please don't go anywhere. We're here to support everyone and that is what we will do for you, no matter what decisions you make. Much love and hugs to you. xxxxxx",

      "Content": "Hi Stoksie I had the same thing happen to me while I was on holiday recently. I went to the resort doctor who said my boob was infected and he gave me antibiotics and an antibacterial cream, zfter he had drained the liquid out and cleaned the area. When we got home I just happened to run in to my surgeon while I was waiting to see the oncologist. My surgeon had a look at the wound and squeezed some liquid out but she wasn't worried. It was just a build up of body fluid, called seroma, that can happen after surgery, and it finds the weakest point of a wound to escape from. My advice to you would be to see your GP and ask them to take a swab, to check for infection, and maybe get some antibiotics to be on the safe side. My practice nurse squeezed the fluid out and dressed it, but it healed after abut 24 hours. Since then all has been well. I hope this helps. Love and hugs to you. xx",

However, I have spent most of the day in tears as I read text messages from friends in my team, as they reply to my text telling them about what is happening. My line manager has been great so far, so have many friends have been supportive, if in disbelief, and have sent hugs and love over the ether. I suppose all I can do now is, like you say, go with the flow and take each day as it comes. I'll stay in touch. Many thanks. xxx",

I have christened the lump Colin, don't know why that name, but a friend and I, she has been clear for 5 years, have decided that Colin's days are numbered and that he will be gone by this time next week. I can, and will, beat this, so will you all, and we can look back in years to come and laugh at how indaequate Colin really was!! My partner and I have a holiday booked in the Maldives for 4th August and we will be going and we will enjoy ourselves and come back refreshed and ready to face the next steps. Thank you all for your words of encouragement and support, you're all amazing. xxx",

I found a lump in my left breast just over 3 weeks ago, was fast tracked to my local breast care centre, and got my results yesterday. I have a grade 2 lump which is small, responsive to some hormones but not the ones that will make it grow. I have been booked in for surgery, lumpectomy, on 25 July, and have gone from feeling acceptance and being practical yesterday, to absolute disbelief and a feeling of being caught up in something that I can't stop, today. I have been told that emotions go haywire at a time like this but can't really grasp how I feel. I thought I'd join this community as I have read lots about McMillan and it seemed the right thing to do. Any helpful tips or friendly words would be most welcome.",

I know it's still early days and my emotions will change on a regular basis, but what really upsets me is the fact that I can no longer give blood!!! Does that seem silly? I've only recently received my 25 donations badge and certificate and was hoping to give more, but because Colin (yes, that's what I've christened the lump!) has made an apprearance I can't donate any more. Maybe now I'll try to raise money for more research into cancer and how to treat it.",

She's awesome and gave me lots of information, but when I got home and tried to read it, I found I couldn't take any of it in. I'm going in tomorrow to have Colin, the lump, removed and although I know everything will be fine, I feel 'spaced out' for want of a better phrase. I feel nervous, emotional, shaky, yet strangely optimistic. Talk about coping with a range of emotions!!!!!!! I'm keeping a journal of events, feelings etc, and I find that it helps to write things down, but it all feels as though this is happening to someone else. This site is amazing, as are the people on it, and I feel lucky to have somewhere to go for support, understanding and the chance to rant. Good luck to everyone on here. Love to you all. xxx",

      "Content": "Hi lovely You poor thing.  A mammogram isn't pleasant but its good that your doctor is on the ball.  The actual procedure doesn't take long.  The radiographer will squeeze your boob between two plates and take an x-ray type picture.  They will probably do both boobs, but it doesn't take long. Results usually take about 2 weeks. I would say don't worry, but its natural to worry.  The fact that you have a quick appointment doesn't necessarily mean that there is anything sinister going on; its procedure now to fast track anything 'dodgy', so it could just be a cyst, lumpy boobs or anything a little bit odd. Do you have any family or close work mates, that could go with you for the appointment?  My partner came with me for my initial appointment, 6 years ago, and although I wanted to be on my own, I was so glad that he was there.  I'll be thinking of you.  I have an appointment this Thursday for a scan and mammogram as I've found a lump on my 'freaky boob' (where I had cancer 6 years ago), so I do know what you're going through.  Try to stay positive (almost impossible) and please let me know how you get on.  If you need to talk, please don't be afraid to 'friend' me; we can then talk confidentially. Good luck lovely.  Always here for you xx",

Apparantly there is one make of anti-depressants that won't counteract the effects of Tamoxifen but she couldn't find the name so she is leaving a prescription at the reception desk!! She was lovely and let me cry for a while. In true superhero style, Steve (my partner), has been lovely and understands how I'm feeling. I don't know how I'd cope without him. I'm taking a couple of days off work to get my head round having to take more pills then I'll be back to my new normal self. Thanks again for all the kind words and virtual hugs - I really appreciate everyone's kindness. Love and hugs to you all; keep smiling and don't let the bugger, that is cancer, get you down.",

      "Content": "Okay, so I've had a lumpectomy and some lymph nodes removed, have one nipple that is pointing up and one that points down, have finished my radiotherapy and have been taking Tamoxifen since September. I thought I was doing okay, but today I've taken a day off fwork because 'I can't be bothered'. I thought I was coping quite well with this obnoxious disease. My partner has truly been a superhero with his emotional support, attending all of my appointments with me and keeping me laughing all the way through,and my three adult children have given me as much support as they could have, but now I feel extremely low and very emotional. I shouted at my partner last night for no real reason, and all but ignored him this morning when he got up for work. The tamoxifen haven't really affected me; no hot flushes, mood changes etc, but at the moment I feel that the whole world is against me and I am losing control. I've rung my doctor for advice and am waiting for her to call me back, and all I can think of is taking anti-depressants to get me through the day. I am usually a 'happy go lucky kind of girl' who sees the positive in most things, takes life as it comes and likes a laugh. My partner and I have been positive through this whole life changing experience, and have laughed a lot, but today I am at an all time low. I am so angry with cancer - it not only makes a person ill, but it drains all the emotions, costs loads of money in petrol and parking fees, takes huge chunks of time out of your day, and plays with your mind. My workmates, and bosses, have been very understanding, but now that all the treatment is finished they seem to have forgotten what happened to me and seem to think that I am now the same 'bubbly' person I was last June. I'm not and don't like who I am. Any ideas for coping with these feelings would bevery much appreciated. Apologies for all the negativity, I'll cheer up soon. Promise. Much love, hugs and positive vibes to everyone. xxx",

I was told that any tight fitting t shirt or vest top would give support, but I have since bought some Genie bras from amazon. They are lovely. They are a tight knit fabric and have extra padding and I find that they give me the support I need without being tight. They are cut low in the armpit so don't rub on my scar. Don't worry abut being tired, just go with it and rest when you need to. Your emotions have been to hell and back since your diagnosis and will probably be like that for quite a while; again just go with it and if you need to cry, just cry. Everyone on here is on your side, so if you need to rant and rave or just want some virtual hugs, log in and we will be here for you. I'm not feeling too tired now so I'm beginning to do more. I was given codeine phosphate tablets on discharge, so I take them at night as they help me sleep, so I don't feel too tired. We're all on your side, so don't be afraid to come on and have a moan!! I'm sending you love and hugs and hope that you soon feel much better. xxx",
