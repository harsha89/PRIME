      "Content": "Hello Grey Bird I came across this forum by accident, researching DCIS, following my first mammogram (i've just turned 48) and your post was a shock, as it relates to exactly how I am feeling.  Having been told not to worry if I got a recall, as they often need to recall ladies first time to obtain comparison images, I was in complete shock when I was told there was an area of concern in my left breast.  I have had a further mammogram, ultrasound and biopsy and am awaiting results - keeping everything crossed!! This seems like a great place for support; I hope you are doing well. Karen",

      "Content": "Hello Jacqui My mindset is, as yours was, hoping, when I go for my results, I will be celebrating the all clear.  Bit of a rollercoaster ride of emotions waiting, trying to put it to the back of my mind, having told my parents and daughter everything was fine - they don't even know i've had a biopsy - figured no point everyone worrying!  Hope you are doing OK and all goes well next week.
