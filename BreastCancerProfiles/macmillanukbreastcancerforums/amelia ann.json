      "Content": "Thank you Jane, for this very helpful alert to examine the ingredients of Letrozole and to everyone for relating their experiences of coping with the impact - mine is Cipla's version. I've been on Letrozole since February after coming off HRT over two weeks just before Christmas.  The side effects have only really kicked in these last few weeks, with aching joints [particularly swollen fingers], hot flushes and night sweats, tearfulness and constipation - most unhelpful for someone with a prolapse.  The night sweats seriously disrupt my sleep, just as they did during the menopause, which means I feel tired most of the time. I've been doing the slow breathing exercises recommended by Macmillan, not as often as I should, but it does seem to help when feeling a hot flush come on - especially when in company and it's not always possible to leave the room.  I think I can count myself fortunate that I only have roughly 6-8 hot flushes per day - but I feel very hot most of the time.  I've taken to wearing all cotton clothing where possible as this helps me to cool down more quickly.  Also, a glass of cold water seems to reduce the impact of  night sweats for me, apart from sponging down and changing night clothes! It's good to know that others are coping with similar problems - Best wishes, Amelia-ann",

      "Content": "Thank you for that Lynn; it's very useful to know that one can ask to change drug if the side effects become too problematic.  I've heard of anastrozole, but not the other drug.  I might give Letrozole another month and then consider asking to change as the joint aches make it very difficult to move first thing in the morning, never mind the night sweats.
