I wasn't given this choice to make I'm afraid, but met with a consultant who had a suggested plan which included both chemo and radio after my lumpectomy. Has your mum just chatted with the nurses? Will she see the oncologist perhaps who might make things clearer? Maybe this option thing does happen frequently, if so someone will be along soon who will know, but I'm glad I didn't have to choose- I'd prefer to be guided by the experts.

He hates the cancer too and we all hate the side effects, but eventually the treatment will do its job. Give yourself a hug for being tough enough to take this journey, that none of is want to be on, and don't beat yourself up. Cuddle your boy with his honesty, it's not a weakness to give the vibe of hating the cancer, and start again tomorrow. You will get there, you're amazing and doing brilliantly. I bet you get a lot less rest than most of us- mine are at school each day so I can nap, no wonder you're exhaustled. Take care and I'm sure others will be along soon with lovely advice and wisdom.

I've had 2 sessions now and can really recommend it for sleep. I get the sessions at the hospital, no fee, and it might be worth a go if there's something local to you?

This week I started back at work! Take one day at a time is the best advice I read in here. Take any complementary therapies you can get. My hospital gave me reflexology which I didn't think would do much, but boy is it relaxing! You may find another one suits you; I wasn't a fan but it's horses for courses. I tried to do a 15 minute walk each day and get up to see the family out of the door each morning. Some days that was really about it! Accept that you're living in the slow lane for a while. Now I'm trying to get out into the other lanes again it all seems very fast! Another tip I received from someone also in this boat was to not say \"what if?\"... Tricky but worth trying!

I take my hat off to you (no pun intended, I never used to wear them until chemo took my hair) for managing all this nutrition (?) work alongside your chemo. I think though, you might be at risk of worrying many people on here. Boil and cool tap water? Really? Uk water does not need to be boiled. I worry about people beginning this journey believing they need to bath twice a day and bleach their sink before washing a piece of fruit. I know I need to save my energy for worthwhile and recommended activities like going for a walk. I have been told to avoid alcohol, deep fried food and dark chocolate as my liver is struggling with the chemo and yet you are recommending dark chocolate. I will stick to my crunchie bar and the odd twix. We are all on different regimes and we are all individuals. I come here  to offer and receive support. Thanks but no thanks from me for your nutrition advice. Hope I haven't been harsh. Bad day.

      "Content": "Hi maggie, it definitely exists! I finished chemo 6 weeks ago and am just getting my vocabulary back, I couldn't find words I wanted which was frustrating! I found I could manage only one task at a time- even more annoying! I played scramble online with my daughter and others and this week I won my first game since December- which I put down to chemo. Definite evidence in my book! I'm hoping to start reading books again as I found I got confused if there were more than 3 characters. I'm sure people have other experiences of the effects if chemo fog, but for me the worst bit is that cloud which stops you from feeling like you. Rest assured, it will lift once they stop pumping in the drugs. Good luck, you're not going mad, just take it easy and you'll get there x",

This Wednesday clubber had no 5 of 6 yesterday.normally only a couple of hours but poor veins are shot to pieces so it took 4 people to have a go each then poor lady in the room had an allergic reaction. Thankfully mild and she continued treatment. Not the usual smooth experience, but only 1 to go. Great day earlier in week though. Look good feel better afternoon was great. If you're thinking about going then do it! Met nice people in the same boat and came home with fantastic goodie bag of branded cosmetics and perfume. Great top tips for creating eyebrows and I had a lovely time.big hugs to all of you with chemo today and tomorrow. Rest up and keep counting down- we're doing it!! Xx  ",

Those beasties are being zapped it's just a shame it makes us feel so cr** but at least that means it's doing the job. You'll be making those lovely dinners again soon and cheering on your team with the loudest voice in the stadium. Goodnight all x",

      "Content": "Hi Sarah, I'm coming up for my 2 year check soon, also breast cancer and my children were 13 and 7. I can only agree with what others have said. Honesty and openness helped, and the medikidz carton book was the one my son returned to again and again- he's the youngest. I read it first and we used the language in it to explain everything. My daughter liked this book http://www.eekmymummy.co.uk/  and still looks at it now. They got to watch lots of films- with me nodding off on the sofa during chemo, I recommend bulk cooking so you can freeze spares for days you don't feel like it, and we discovered some great friends and some others who actually weren't up for it. Accept any help that's offered too- people like to be useful! My son didn't like the wig so I didn't wear one as he thought it felt 'freaky'. They will look at my scar when we are changing for swimming or I'm getting dressed and I truly cannot believe now that it was our family that it happened too.  I wish you lots of luck, take one day at a time and enjoy all the extra cuddles.
