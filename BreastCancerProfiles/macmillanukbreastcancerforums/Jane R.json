    "Content": "Hi Shhena I have finished my six sessions of chemo on 23rd Feb, I have had the first of my herceptin infusions today - I am having 14 in all 3 weeks apart, so I calculate last one to be 20th December - I didn't have too much trouble with chemo - I generally had a couple of days of tiredness following the treatment - but made my self do nothing - I allowed for that amd therefore didn't plan anything - If I felt well enough I did go out, but listened to my body. Like you I was expected all sorts of horrors. Every one is different as they say. The worst thing I found was the Blood count jabs - 5 days after treatments 4-6 they gave me strange paid right round my middle, but after 24 hrs wore off. I made sure I took my anti sickness pills because was told it is better to prevent than try and treat, I took them for 10-14 days after treatment, and therefore never really suffered too much -  yes I felt sick on and off but was never actually sick. I also used a anto bacterial mouthwash for 10 days after as well, never used the hospital  one - and never suffered with sore mouth or anything. I did have strange taste though for about 7 days - everything tasted metallic!! but did not stop me eating - hence I have gained 21 lbs!! As they say, every one is different - BUT listen to your body, they are powerful drugs, rest when you need good luck, love Jane R (Hope I havn't gone on too much, and hope it helps)",
