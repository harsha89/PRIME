      "Content": "good morning Ladies I have taking Tamoxifen since July and have the most awful symptoms. I understand with insomnia I keep waking up all night long but the biggest one I have are the extreme hot flushes. I am in the menopause anyway due to a hysterectomy a few years ago and the flushes were not too back but now they have intensified soooo much I don't need a coat in this hot weather it is driving me insane. Also at times I feel helpless and get angry at the slightest thing. I wish we could all get a miracle tablet but as per Jewel it is a hard decision to make whether to take these tablets or not.

      "Content": "Good morning to everyone I was wondering if anyone has any advice on the following: I was moved out of our main office back in January due to taking Tamoxifin at the time and having the horrible intense hot flushes and I screamed at someone to either turn off or turn down the heating as it was affecting me quite a bit and they know my situation. I am now on Letrozole. I was moved into an office on my own for which I am  very happy in as I can have the window open when I want and the heating if it gets a bit chilly. But our head office is closing and they are putting people in other offices where there is space to be used and someone has whispered in my ear that I could be going back into there so she can come in here. I am not sure if it is true or not but I do not want to go back in the other room as my colleagues do not either understand or do not want to and even a year later don't give a damn about other peoples feelings when I get no support from anyone but expect me to support them. Maybe people may think I am being selfish but  I am the only person looking after myself for some reason even my partner does not seem to give as monkey's at the moment. Sorry if I sound a bit down!!

We held a Macmillan coffee day at my work on Friday and a lot of kind people came from our other offices as we are an estate agents and kindly ate cake, drank teas and contributed more cake and their money. We managed to make just under £340.00 and work is contributing a match of £250.00 so this had made my week. By the end of the day I was very tired but happy. I only managed 2pieces of cake all day so felt a bit ill. I thanked my work colleagues for their help in contributing and their help in this venture. I finally start my radiotherapy on Monday 9th of Ocotober finally. Big hugs and kisses to all you ladies out there as this site has helped me in my darkest times over the past few weeks. I feel so lucky that it was caught early but I no my journey is not finished yet . Xxxxxxxxxx",

It sounds like what my siblings are like and they live 12000 miles away from me in Australia. The worst is my oldest sister who did not even with me Merry Christmas so for now I am forgetting about them and thinking of myself and my partner. I would never dream of treating them badly even though I live here in the UK I would still be phoning them at least weekly to see how they are but since our mum passed last year no one can be bothered to see how I am. I hope all goes well for you and take care of yourself as you are the important one in this situation. You will get lots of supports and hugs for all of us ladies xxxx  Wendy",

      "Content": "Good morning Ladies I had a very bad day yesterday as could not shake off feeling really down. It just came over me all of a sudden and I went into my face book account and wrote about people not asking how I am as I have not heard from my siblings at all back in my home country even though I have lived in the UK for over 28 years. The only people to respond was my oldest nephew and his wife. They were very honest in saying that they were too scared to ask but I just told them that it is ok to be scared but just ask me what you want to know. I said that they got it all I have had Radiotherapy and hopefully that has killed any stray cells if there were any to begin with. They told me they loved me and I told them I loved them back and will keep them updated but for the moment I have logged out of this account for a while until I can get some peace in my mind. My partner even asked me last night why I was not talking much to him which makes a change as sometimes he thinks I talk too much as he had read what I put on face book. I just told him that I just did not want to talk much and just need a bit of peace good thing he understood. Today I feel a bit better but maybe tonight I might just go home for a good cry as they are just sitting there waiting to come out. Sorry ladies for rambling on but hope this gets me through the rest of my working day as now it is the weekend and I am off work on Monday so will get a bit of peace then. Hugs to all xxx",

And having to describe to people what you have had done. mine was  a lumpectomy/Sentinel nodes now on Letrozole after having that horrible Tamoxifen for over 6 months. now have more symptoms to look forward to. I had to describe why I had  my hysterectomy to a male manager in 2015 I was very embarrassed but he was embarrassed more so served him right for asking :) Like you I have had quite a few ops over the past few years and have the battle scars to prove it. I think just take you time once you get back to work or maybe see if you can start back gradually. I am sorry to read that you have had a rough time and hope you also get your op very soon for your boob. Have a lovely day Wendy W xxx Gentle hugs for you",

I worked through all mine it was only a small tumour and Radiotherapy afterwards but the shock of it sure throws you off of your axis. I understand that if one more person says to me also you look like you have not had cancer I will kick their backsides as they do not understand what it can do to a person and what the treatments and also the worry of if it is going to come back. I am Letrozole now was on Tamoxifen but that was awful but still am having awful flushes. We will all get there and coming on here even though I don't say much just reading what the ladies write is sometime the thing to help me get though the day.

My worst is my back as I cannot put pressure on my right side shoulder blade as sometimes it feels like it is burning. I will look into the supplement just have to be careful what I take as I also take other medication for high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes so a total of 12 tablets a day including the Letrozole.

I wish you lots of hugs and love as I understand what you are going through. I lost my mum last year just before I was diagnosed, you will be strong but let yourself cry as well even use it as a release and eventually over time you will be fine. Just take your time with things and let it sink a bit at a time. Take care Hun xxx Wendy W xxx",

      "Content": "Hi Emma I hope all goes well for you but it is best to have the tests and the biopsy even if it is just for peace of mind. I am new here to but I went to my GP because of fatty tissue under my left arm, they sent me to my local hospital who sent me for my first ever mammogram and ultrasound where they found a tiny lump instead in my right breast they said the size of the end of a pen. They did a biopsy same day and I had to wait 2 week before I was told I had breast cancer as I never had any symptoms at all so was glad for the fatty tissue under my left arm. I have had a lumpectomy and 3 nodes taken out back in the middle of July but at the moment have a leaky boob due to a blood clot working it way out so once it has all come out hopefully I will move onto my Radiotherapy days. Sounds weird cannot wait as walking around leaky is not my idea of fun. Please think positive and I will cross my fingers for you. Winky XX",

      "Content": "Good morning Ladies hope you are all enjoying the sunshine while it is here. I was put on Tamoxifin last year after finishing my Rads early nobember17. It did take me into some dark places, also very bad hot flushes all day every day as already in menopause through a hysterectomy and tears..  I was also arguing with people I work due to them having heaters under their desks and I could not have a window even slightly open.  I am now in an office on my own which is good because I can have the window open as they like their office very hot and windows closed. Talk to your GPS or Oncologists if it causing a lot of these problems. I was put on Letrozole in January by my Oncologist as I had a blood test to prove I was in full Menopause which I have had for over three years and they put me on this which unfortunately I still get bad flushes and also very achy stiff joints now at the grand old age of 50. I even get a lot of spasms in my legs but it is what us ladies must do and if it helps the cancer from coming back I will out up with anything at the moment. Take care all Wendy W Please keep smiling as it will make everyone wonder what you have been up to!!!",

      "Content": "Good morning I had a Wide incisions op and Sentinel nodes taken back in July for a very small DCIS but as above I only barely remember seeing the surgeon after my op but I ended up in the ICU because the anastethic doctors messed up with the breathing tube and my throat swelled up as they did not read the notes from another hospital where I had a hysterectomy a few years earlier as I have a short airway. They did not try the recommended until the 4th try and by then it was swollen. I woke up in there with a tube down my throat and the surgeon saying  I was ok. The head of ICU wrote a letter that I must give if I ever have another op to say how it must be done in future or I could end up there again. I went home 2 days later with a swollen breast and a very sore throat my poor partner thought he was picking me up from day surgery but instead had to see me like that and no one could tell me when I could go home. I thought all info in the leaflets would happen to but never did the BCN nurses took a week to call me back. Wendy",

I am so sorry to read how down you are but people can be very disrespectful. I am finding it myself as some people just do not seem to want to know or want to understand. I was diagnosed back at the end of June had an op in July and am starting Radiotherapy this morning for 19 sessions. Am on Tamoxifen as well. My family are no help either they are back in my home country Australia and are older than me but not one of them has ask me how I am and coping. I try to stay strong for myself and my partner. Maybe you need to go and see you GP and ask for some help there if you need to talk my Name is Wendy and I am on here most days. You take care of yourself now and here are lots of virtual hugs.
