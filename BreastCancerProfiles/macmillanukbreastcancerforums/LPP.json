    "Content": "Hi Jackie, I started my first of six fect Chemo treatment on Monday. It went actually a lot better than I had imagined! I had the treatment at 3.30pm took 45 minutes. Then at 5pm I went home. I felt absolute fine up until about 7pm,then I felt like I had the worst hangover ever, my head was very sore and I was sick quite a lot. It was quite a rough night. I managed to have a good sleep, then in the morning I woke up and had my breakfast and within 5 minutes that was back up. I then went back to bed and slept for three hours and when I woke up I felt like someone had changed my body while I was sleeping!! I felt really good! I had two slices of toast, cups of tea, later on had a bowl of pasta, then more toast and lots of fluid and lots of rich tea biscuits! Had a lovely shower and even managed to do some house work!! Today I have woke up and feel good again! I would defiantly take the anti sickness tablets they are a blessing! I was really nervous to how I would feel after the treatment. For my next treatment I now know what I should feel and how long I will feel rubbish for! You have got to think that's the first one over and only 5 more to go!! Be strong my darling and we are going through the same treatment at the same time so I'm here if you need to talk!! best Wishes xxxxxxx ",
