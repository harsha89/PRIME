    "Content": "Hi l have a 5year old who lm having the same problem so cant really help much, but after reading your post l will get the book from Macmillan for him, didnt know it was out there. l have told him everything (about him mummy having one booby, medicine making her a bit tired and will loose my hair) but have never mentioned the cancer word.  My hair fell out two weeks after my 1st chemo and my 3 children shaved it off- they loved the thrill of it, how many kids get the chance to shave their mums head, we all had a laugh doing it, l think as long as kids feel that your not hiding anything from them, they cant think the worst in their little heads. xxx",
