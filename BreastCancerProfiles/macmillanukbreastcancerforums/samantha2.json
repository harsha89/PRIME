      "Content": "Hi I wanted to ask about the premedication for weekly paclitaxel at say 50mg/m2. I understand its a low dose but wanted to know if that means they can be lax with the premedication Is it true you must be given an antihistamine and dexamethasone at least 30 minutes (30 to 60 mins for iv) before. Can they miss off the anti-histamine? Does anyone know why they have to give dexamethasone at least 30 minutes before? If they don't give the anti-histamine and the give steroids just before, would that be dangerous?",
