      "Content": "Hi totally new to this . I had my lumpectomy and sentinel node biopsy on 26th jan . Was doing really well up until last couple of days where its started to swell under my arm and my nipple where they've had to reposition it . I think i thought i was doing well and have done too much (won't admit I've got cancer i think ) . Anyway get my results this week so not really thinking straight either . I hate the waiting game . Going to go to drop in clinc tomorrow to see if it can be drained but anything i can do to reduce the discomfort xx",

She said its healing really well and looks amazing considering its only been 11 days .  I'v been having baths with coconut oil , moisturising with calendula & hypericum cream , rosehip oil for scars and arnica tablets for bruising with amazing results .  Just to smash results on Thursday now . Feeling more positive today.  Even been out with dogs in the snow today . Good luck everyone and thanks for the help . Jo xxxx",

Thought i would have escaped chemo after having all clear in lymph nodes and just have radiotherapy.  So another two weeks wait now so fingers crossed again , I'm sure there going to get stuck one day with all the crossing .  Anyway having glass of wine to celebrate.

The same one i use for cooking .  I just can't bring myself to use fragranced shower gels at min as not healed properly yet .  The other cream is fab though i was recommended that by the health shop in my village . Definitely give it a go . Jo xx",

      "Content": "Hi  I notice the link has been left for the oncotype test hope it helps . The margin is the clearance around the tumour once taken out and if its clear of cancer its a goid margin .  Good luck with your results i hope you get on ok . The waiting is the worst , i actually thought i wouldn't have to wait again after the last lot but again I'm waiting 2 weeks ( everything seems to take 2 weeks) . Keep us posted on your progress  Jo xxx",
