Just started Chemo on 11th April , so just taking each day as it comes. Been suffering from headaches and naseau and facial pain, and have been pretty tired.Constipation has been one of my problems since surgery in February ,have tried a few concoctions,including prune juice I know its not everybodys choice, lactoluse and movicol sachets.
