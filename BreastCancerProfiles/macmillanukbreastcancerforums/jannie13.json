I found it more painful than the operation arm and putting things like coats on and carrying was awful. Ive been referred to Physio twice tey do massage up the veins and exercise's similar to the post op stretches to start with then more stretching. I found I had to take paracemtamol before rads as the rad position was painful and I couldn't get my arm down the radiographer had to lift it down....but the arm behind the head position did help stretch the veins...after 2 chemo's it was up both inner arm and outer. I still have issues now with neck pain aggravated by lifting and then the arm starts to hurt. My oncologist and BC nurse did not believe it was more than phlebitis and gave me cream but the McMillan centre got me referred to Physio. They argued it wasn't cording, I don't really care what they call it but as it left big ugly cord like veins that were visible the length of my arm I'm not sure why its not cording. My arm now looks normal but I cant have bloods done without warming and a paediatric needle it then triggers arm pain.

      "Content": "Hi Beachhutter, I was diagnosed last year with T-neg had two ops chemo and rads. I think we all identify with the horrible scary journey but its doable. I managed to continue child-minding right through with 3 under 5 11 hours a day and the older ones one of whom is on the spectrum. So it may not be as bad as you think (fingers toes and all else crossed). I know that preparing your LO as much as possible is important and there are a lot of books and resources out there depending on his understanding. I explained that the medicine was making me better but was yucky stuff that meant I would be ill and tiered some days and even my hair was going to be poorly and not want to come out some days. The children would arrive saying its a pirate day today and took it much better than I thought. My Asperger's child is a hair twiddler and likes to hold mine too so this was an issue and I decided for that reason to have a short cut well in advance and avoided wigs when he was around. I wore knotted scarfs before losing my hair a bit so that he would be used to me wearing them. We also changed the way we played a bit so that he got used to me being less physically active and my partner took over this part and I did the quieter things reading singing etc. starting from diagnosis meant by the time I started chemo he was less worried about the changes he could see in me. The other children all took it in their stride as I prepared them for days I wouldn't be about (treatment afternoons and the following day mostly). Friends were great with offers of cooking shopping etc and I took every opportunity to rest. I'm the other side now and getting stronger everyday. Cancer is pants but its brought some positive change too. I made a commitment to spend more time on fun, I have new friends and don't waste time worrying about the ones who didn't want to know, I appreciate the little things much more and unlike the other types of BC my treatment has finished no more injections no side effects just a slightly new me with hair that is not the same as the old (now very curly) more eyelashes than I ever had before, my feet are soft due to the extreme chemical peel, and my stats are not too different to what they were before but I'm more aware and more conscious of my breasts so more likely to spot anything in the future. Yes I have down times but not too many an getting less so all in all life is not bad. I hope the comments that are posted will help everyone about to start out on the path. x",

I would ask to see the real Oncologist before I was given an extra week to see if feeling returned but in that time it didn't and I was wondering if I was imagining it until I got out of shower to find I had a toe nail that had cut my foot and I didn't even feel it. The Onc said as the side effects were accumulative I was likely to get more loss on each round and as it hadn't recovered it was better given my odds not to take the risk. I also had 2 days od blurred vision which they said would get longer each time, something I didn't fancy as I could not read or watch tv let alone drive. T was only giving me 1% so an easy decision but obviously everyone is different. Istill get tingling eventyping and doing fiddly things like necklaces and watches is hard.",

My GP openly says they are not trained to identify or deal with issues after BC and I should contact my bc team so anything boob related goes to them for 5 years. I is awful to keep getting these knock backs I've recently had to have another biopsy a year after finishing treatment and go for results tomorrow.

      "Content": "I never lost the hair around the back so despite having it cut to a number 1 it has always been thicker and longer than the top...really strange if you leave it so have kept having it trimmed so top catches up with sides and because the back and sides keep growing thicker in a sort of weird clown shape so every 4 or 5 weeks a trim. It did go really curly so the repeated trims have cut some of that out too. The last cut has left a fringe that now looks like it was meant and a shape that is sort of longer picky my next step is to hopefully continue growing the top, so yes about 7 cuts/trims once you have the first one you do feel better. I went to a Toni and Guy strength in style at first as they cut it in a private room so felt better than out on the main shop floor.",

Obviously everyone is different and you can be unlucky to in both reaction and infection. I was able to work right through treatment with support. The first round was worse as they needed to tweek side effects so I took a day off then did things like the reading playing tables, my co minder did the school runs. Week 2 and 3 I worked as normal but took an afternoon nap. I did get more tiered by the end of 6 cycles and did less physical running around, no housework and dinner was down to the husband. I did wear gloves if doing nappies (as normal) and noses washed hands a lot more and had antibac gel. Also very thorough cleaning door handles etc as children can forget to wash hands and although you send them back they have already touched it. My own towel. Other than that carried on as normal except watching where I ate out and no prepared salads. My parents were great and did keep children away if they showed any sign of being ill, but that was only a couple of days.",

      "Content": "Hi I've had this having had 2 fec in the arms back in August. I was given no advice and have only just started physio. You can see the lines of veins and some raised swelling around them worse when stretched. You can feel a hard line vein up the arm on both effected areas and one goes into the arm pit. Advice from physio was to do the same stretches as post op and to massage up towards arm pit along vein. Heat can cause lymphodema apparently. Some say this is cording and others chemo induced phlebitis, but it feels horrible in what should be the good arm....the rads arm position was painful at first so took pain killers 20 mins before but in long run helped with pain raising arm. Annoyed this has caused pain and discomfort when a picc line before chemo would have avoided it...my veins were too bad for a picc after round one so had a Hickman. I can now reach upwards and put on coats but need to build strength. Lifting is still a bit uncomfortable but better since Christmas when I couldn't carry a bag I can now manage moderately weighted ones....maybe my husband paid them to avoid me spending too much. Hope this helps.",

      "Content": "I finished chemo 2 years ago. Round one of fec damaged my veins too badly for the planned picc and round 2 made more damage to other veins in my good (said laughingly) arm. The immediate problem was much worse than anything on my bad arm unable to put my own coat on, to stretch my arm, lift things, general pain etc. As others describe you could see several ugly ruched veins running the length of my arm and up into my arm pit worse when arm was straightened. Differing opinions from doctors -  phlebitis, cording and general damage but to me it looked like several  cords and was very painful. I found taking Paracetamol and lying in position for rads did help release the veins a bit over my 18 session course - it was painful especially at first and I had to have help to lower my arm. Massaging by physio up the vein over about 10 weekly sessions has improved the appearance and pain in the arm itself. I am now left wit chronic neck and shoulder pain radiating from the arm pit and task like carrying shopping, typing and driving aggravate it. The pain clinic say I should have had help sooner as now the nerves are having their own party, If I were starting on this again I would not have chemo before a picc, If I missed that I would be going for physio or massage as soon as I could ideally during chemo....and the stretching exercise's are a must even when your feeling like you have been hit by a steam roller..",

My last bloods form the arm took all afternoon and they still didn't get enough the next day I went in having drank constantly but the biggest thing was having the arm in a hot pack all the way to hospital so it was really warm they also said once you have a few issues your body goes into fight or flight and the veins shut down so trying (ha ha) to relax helps. Hope it goes well I would personally say go with the line to stop more damage and keep stretching the good arm so the veins don't tighten and cord which is what has happened to me ...the surgeon recommended putting hand behind head as a good position...practice for rads too.  all the best x",

Your not making me feel better or getting a better understanding. If they want to raise money raise in other ways, if they want to give an idea of how it feels have short clips of how I felt when I lost my eyelashes, nails came off or any thing else but don't pretend they now know how it feels. The one thing I find most of a reminder of all the s... is seeing others in scarfs and knowing what they are going through, seeing a lady with short cropped hair and thinking that was me, it reduces me to tears. Even my husband reacts to it. Maybe its different when treatment is further away and maybe I will desensitise, maybe the people on the panel already have reached that point....but many of us haven't and no money raised is worth the mental torture these ads or seeing the fundraisers shaved heads put us through.",

      "Content": "While getting ready for treatment in those scary days of not knowing I was out at Hampton Court flower show with my husband keeping my at risk arm covered fearing sun burn etc. There were ladies in scarfs ladies withe close cut hair but not the outfits to match we talked about how I would look etc. It was emotional for both of us. I know my husband doesn't like short hair it made my feelings harder to deal with. He had a heart attack while I was undergoing treatment which may have made him more empathetic but now when we're out he gets when I'm feeling I was like that 18 months ago.  Loosing your hair when it's not your choice is never the same as choosing to have a hair cut. Having people say it looks good makes no difference when it's not your choice. Fearing a slipped wig wondering about boys giggling behind you is nothing like choosing to shave your head and waving wow I'm great look what I did for cancer...is nothing like having no choice or having cancer or understanding how it feels....which is why we all get so upset at the glib phrases like it's saving your life, it's temporary, but you've got such pretty eyes....",

I also got a couple of cheap non wired bras that I could cut the straps on as I had so much swelling all bra straps were too short...I then made them longer with ribbon. I would avoid anything that goes over  the head as it can be hard to move. Also due to swelling it can be worth getting a bra extender as then as you go back to normal band size you can revert to you normal bra size...I went up from a 36G to a 40E. The drain tube just fitted inside the bra and up over the top. You may not have it in I didn't first time second op was all nodes so had it overnight.

If you have a long back you may find no bra strap is long enough so if you already wear the strap as long as it goes so the bra fits at the bottom of you shoulder blade level it may be a good idea to look for one that can be strapless so you can tie with your own ribbon. Bravissimo do very comfortable night tops with in built bras, often in their sale. They are very thick and can do as an initial comfy top. I still wear mine in the evenings 2 years on as swelling from rads builds up in the day. If you don't get enough support from the cheap asda/jml bras now they will nor give you support post surgery so see how they feel now. Consider the maternity ranges as they are soft with no seems - hand for rads too.   Do not remove labels and keep receipts asking manager to agree a return after surgery if you explain they may not fit, often they will extend the return deadline. so get her to sign your receipt. Avoid the bras lined with silver as they will not do you through rads. Best of luck.",

You get used to the feeling in your fingers and toes and I find apart from extreme cold and fiddly things like necklaces I also have less strength to undo jars a bit scary as im only 52 and wonder how I will open medicines as I get older as even blister packs now need a knife.",

      "Content": "I agree we notice them more as they are personal but some are very shocking and not 100% accurate just after starting chemo the ad cam out with the patient sitting alone in a chemo unit all cold and grey and no friends and unlike more recent ads it didn't change to the colourful scene and supportive  nurse that was terrifying and its only recently that I found that my children actually thought that is what it was like for me my 20 year old was sobbing and I finished chemo last year. I understand the shock value but they do need to think that alongside they are terrifying up to 50% of the population who may go through chemo and make sure it reflects the real situation. The other moment that sticks out for me was going shopping and popping to the ladies I shut the door to be faced with the their is no cure for BC poster. At that time I hadn't been told anything other than I had it and was going fro surgery so I thought OMG I'm going to die I then had a four week wait and still thought I was on borrowed time I really thought that all this was going to give me 10 years as most because the way stats are given. Sometimes they experts forget we don't know it all and are so rushed it doesn't come over so then your in limbo. And if you call them it can be days before you get a return call.",

My BC nurse had the ability to reduce me to tears no matter how well I thought I was hiding things and that is all it is an act. Every stage for me was scary but not so bad as my imagination once I started. I made a choice not to read too much and never google as that's hard to tell fact from fiction and full of people selling magic cures or horror stories. I would arrange some help for the horses until your recovered from your op and then see what your Oncologist says about the best way forward. Its a tough journey but doable the waiting to start is awful. Good luck x",

      "Content": "I'm sorry to hear of your reoccurrence I don't know how I would handle hearing that. I think you are understandably scared but every treatment has a risk even a tooth extraction as a previous post has said nobody writes about wanting help everything went to plan they get on with that part and worry about other things that are not going right....or have no issue and don't post. I had a full node clearance 2 and a half years ago on a second op neither caused long standing issues but I was more aware of the need to be doing the excercises second time around as the fist op did make movement more limiting, for a week, second op painkillers and exercise from the hour after surgery right through, I even do them now in the shower or when standing around at home. The only long term effect is a slight numbness to the back of the arm which I notice only if I run my fingers down my arm. The swelling you talk about is lymphedema which is a risk if you have injury to the arm, blood pressure taken etc...so you make sure nobody touches that arm, don't get sun burn, clean any cuts and any sign of infection get antibiotics its also worth finding out about lymph massage and doing this daily as it keeps the lymph flowing. If you get it you get treatment by massage and taping or a sleeve but your alive and don't have cancer. What is your prognosis if you don't have the surgery? At 70 you have a lot of living in front of you. Your BC nurse should be able to discuss your worries and help you decide. Hope all goes well",

I found I needed support as the weight of over a stone per boob pulling on scars was too much and was advised to use proper support to stop long term neck and shoulder problems especially as chemo can damage veins, unfortunately the 40 soft cups I found were not supportive enough and caused problems. Bravissimo do support lounge tops in thick material that I wore on sore days and looked like a T-shirt so could wear out....th proper tops are underwired. I did get the silver Royce but it was too itchy for rads so had a struggle getting a soft cup seam free bra and the pull ons other wore did not go over my boobs even in xxxl ....I wore a camisole under the bra which helped. Manufacturers cater for mastectomy's and smaller boobed women larger lumpectomy ladies are left out even the xxxl post surgery sample th hospital found did not fit. Im now back in Underwire and much more comfortable and my boobs are not resting on my tummy. My back is not aching and my neck pain is easing. Bras reduced me to tears many times and cost hundreds of pounds in experiments, I recommend getting a bra extender and looking at maternity ranges.",

It seemed every time I went something changed one op, two , rads, chemo stage 2 stage 3, 15 rads, then 18, picc then  no picc then Hickman. very frustrating and a real rollercoaster .but I'm through it now. Definitely only take things as a rough plan. I had a second op because for some reason no lymph nodes were found after my first so had them all removed, and all clear but still had chemo as my stage went from 2 to 3, apparently the stage can change through the whole sample. It was a scary journey but do able and I guess not as bad as my mind pictured. I just trusted it was the best and decided at the outset it would take a year and it has. On the plus side for me I managed to work through all chemo included with only a few weeks off after surgery and treatment days, you just have to see how your body takes the path which ever one you travel.

I got PJ tops from Bravissimo that were so good quality I could wear as T shirts but non wired. Be prepared to swell up a band size or two...extenders are a cheaper way of using bras through treatment. I also had to cut the straps and tie with ribbon as non were long enough for 3 months or so.",
