    "Content": "Hi I'm 1/2 way through FEC-T. I'm having it at home, so am using the cold caps that you keep in the freezer. Probably not as effective as the ones used in hospital, but I do still have enough hair that I'm not getting any second looks in the supermarket - a very thin to what it was though, especially on top. I found that it started falling out quite heavily just before my second treatment, persevered with the cold cap though and the loss has dramatically slowed - still getting a bit though and it'll be interesting to see what happens now I'm switching to Taxotere. Re exercise and work; I hate the gym, but I am very active - still managing longish walks and horse riding (having to take that carefully 'cos of the surgery though - mastectomy an immediate recon). Treatments one and two, I took the chemo day and the day after off, then worked the mornings for the rest of the week then full-time. Treatment 3 I felt quite rough after - took the chemo week off, worked Mon morning, then fulltime - it's now today and I'm about to go and get on a horse :-) Good luck with the rest of your treatment.
