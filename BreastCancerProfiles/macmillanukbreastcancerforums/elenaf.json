      "Content": "Hi, I had my first lot of FEC on Tuesday and am really struggling, hadn't really thought I'd feel this bad!! I feel sick all the time and am not really eating, since Tuesday all I've eaten is half a sandwich. Is this normal to feel this bad afterwards. I haven't actually been sick, retched a bit but that's it, don't know if I'm just being a wuss or if I should ring the hospital. Thanks for any insight!! Elena",

      "Content": "Hi ladies, I just wanted to say thank you for your comments, after reading them I rang the hospital and they asked me to go in, that was last Thursday and I was released yesterday (Tuesday!) so definitely the right thing to contact them!! Think I must really struggle with sickness I had the Emend pre first lot of chemo so I dread to think what I might have been like!! Saw my onc before being released yesterday and he's come up with ideas to try for next time so fingers crossed I won't be back in again in two weeks time. Just wanted to say thank you again for your support. Elena",
