      "Content": "Hello, I was diagnosed with Breast cancer 4 years ago now and had a masectomy and went back to work originally on a phased return and then full-time.    I've recently had a TRAM reconstruction 6 months ago and at the same time was made redundant from my current post.    Unfortunately my husband had just started a new job and as he need time off to look after me was told not to come back.    The job centre were equally unsympathetic as they could not give him anything as he was not actively seeking work or also I was not disabled enough for him to get carers allowance.  I am awaiting another op for a reduction on the other side and although at the moment financially we are OK I feel as it I am in limbo as not sure when the next op will be.    My breast care nurse said it could be 3 - 6 months.     I still experience tiredness and because I had the TRAM (abdominal operation) do get pain where they removed the muscle if I over do it.   I feel like I am caught in a catch 22 situation - if I start looking for work and then get the call for the operation I will need to tell the employer I will need time off.    If I don't the longer I am out of the job market the harder it will be to find a job and will  impact financially.   I don't want to be in  the benefits system for any longer than I have to.   I am trying to be proactive and have done Careers Counselling course and am up-dating my CV. Just wondered what other's experiences were of looking for work with a new employer after cancer diagnosis, surgery and time off sick.   How sympathetic or accommodating they were. Many thanks",

      "Content": "Hi George, Thanks very much for your message.  It helped me a great deal when I was getting anxious and panicky about things.   Your advice has been great. My husband has since been back down to the job centre and they asked why he didn't apply before.    He told them what the other adviser had said and described the man.   The new adviser said he had been given misleading information and could have been eligible.   So we're now waiting to hear what happens next. In the meantime I have an appointment with my Consultant in December so should hopefully give me some timelines as getting fed up of being in limbo.    As I am feeling better my husband is now actively seeking work so we will see what turns up. I had claimed DLA when I was going through Chemo and that was for about a year.    I did try to reclaim about 2 years ago due to ongoing nerve damage in feet and hands but was turned down.    As I was going back to work decided not to persue.  It would be great when I do go back to work to go back part-time but will have to see how the finances are.    I know there are some people who don't have that option. My goal is to get back to a normal life and to get to next October as that will be when I hit my 5 years.",

      "Content": "Hello, I am really pleased that I have read your message.   I was diagnosed when I was 41 and like yourself was told because of my age I was likely to go through an early menopause. I had one period in May last year after I finished by first lot of chemo and before my second lot.   But my Oncologist said the likelihood was slim that I wouldn't go through the menopause.   So resigned myself to this and dealt with the various menopausal symptons as best I could. I am ER- and HER2- so am on no further treatment.   On Thursday I noticed some bleeding and to my surprise seem to be having a period.     I did wonder why the nightsweats and hot flushes had suddenly subsided.    I am pleased to read this is normal but am prepared for the menopausal symptons to come back.    ",

      "Content": "Hello, I've just had my first session of Docetaxel (have another 3 to do an am dreading it) and must admit it's hit me much harded than the FEC did.   The FEC was rough especially nausea and constipation but I did know what to expect. I only had my first treatment about 10 days ago and experienced really bad bone pain and headache.   I had taken the Co-Codamol perscibed following my masectomy op but ended up with itchy feet.  So switched to paracetamol which seemed to be OK. The worst by far and which I was not expecting was the really bad diahorrea which I ended up on antibiotics for.  Also the lack of interest and loss of appetite.    I ate pretty much normally on FEC.   I am relieved to say that whilst my stomach is still not 100% it is better than it was last week.   Although I am still a little nervous of being not near the loo!! I too have been advised to buy nail varnish for my nails so will be purchasing some.  Although I must admit to never wearing nail varnish previously. At least I know what to expect and felt with the FEC as I had been so \"well\" was probably lulled into a \"false sense of security\".   I hope you treatment goes well. Laura X",

      "Content": "Hello I'm on my third course of Taxotere and relieved I have only one more to go. I've found the symptons to get progressively worse.   I've also got pains in my hands and feet which makes it difficult to sleep at night.    I have put nail varnish on my nails and haven't lost any yet.   However, the tips of my fingers are now numb and it does feel as if someone is sticking a hot needle into the bed of the nail.   Not great.    Oddly, the skin on my left foot is a lot dryer than my right foot and I've noticed my skin is much more sensitive to sunlight.   I was out last Wed and the sun was quite hot eventhough I did wear a suncream and now look like a garden gnome with bright red cheeks.   Not sure if this is the sun or combination of the sun and treatment.   But am vigorously moisturising. I am relieved when I get to the 2nd week when my digestive system is sort of back to normally. I hope you treatment goes well and don't have too many symptons.",
