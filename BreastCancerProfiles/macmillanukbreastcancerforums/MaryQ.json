      "Content": "In 2013 I had a mastectomy (Lobular Stage 2) and since then have had a few anxieties about lumps and bumps under my arm etc...but all has been fine.  I feel like a bit of an imposter because of a worry I have now.  I found a tender lumpy thing about 2 inches which does not feel like a cyst in the other side, sort of vertical and in the 'cleavage' near the chest wall.  Because I had no signs or symptoms the first time I wouldn't know what a cancer lump feels like. Anyway, the Breast Care Nurse saw me on Monday and 'just to make sure' I am having an Ultrasound and Mammogram if necessary next Thursday.  I feel I shouldn't be concerned and feel reluctant to tell anyone in case it is nothing but I feel very odd and detached from it all!  There is a bit of me that thinks I shouldn't waste their time and I feel guilty about that. Is there anyone who can give me any words of advice to get me through?   Thanks MaryQ",

I decided as well to tell my friend who was very understanding as well as knowing why I hadn't said anything up to now.  I am going to talk to my sister later and will mention it to her because even if it turns out to be something benign in all senses of the word, she would have wanted to know in any case. xx",

      "Content": "I love that quote at the end of your bit about letting things go.  Thank you. So, I had the ultrasound and the radiologist did not seem to think there was anything bad to see but I had a mammogram as well, to make sure.  They will ring if there is any concern and I will get a letter if not.  She said that they would be reporting on the mammograms today so I wouldn't have to wait long.  This means that my annual check will be moved to March which is great for me because the echoes of that hot Summer diagnosis still remain and so this year I won't think about it all Summer long! I am so glad I went and they were all so kind and understanding.  Thank you for the support you have all given me.  Obviously until I hear I will still wonder but at least I won't be poking at my boob every time I have a bath! Warm wishes all round x",

      "Content": "Hi Chloecat I have only just joined this forum and have been reading your blog with interest.  I had a diagnosis of Stage 2 Lobular in July 2013...I knew that the conventional route was to have a lumpectomy and radiotherapy and take Tamoxifen.  There was no lymph node involvement. Although I did not go as far as you I made the decision to have a mastectomy and no other treatment.  In other words by doing that I did not have any radiotherapy and I made the choice not to take Tamoxifen.   It was hard going against the norm and in other ways as well and I sometimes wonder what the attitude will be towards me if any mets pop up in the future.  I made these decisions and others in full knowledge of the facts and statistics and I am glad. Look after yourself brave woman MaryQ",

      "Content": "Well done, Chloecat...I have been looking out for your input about the latest appointment and am so pleased to hear this.  You know your body and your body knows you. I am still trying to come to terms with the fact that no-one ever mentions that I have taken my decision, despite the horror on the oncologist's face when I told him I wouldn't take Tamoxifen.     I gather from other sources that there are many women who are prescribed Tamoxifen and don't take it!   So I spend my time wondering if I would ever know if mets sprung up somewhere else in my body and whether it matters!  Ah, well The Solstice is here and Christmas not far behind and I feel for those of you out there who are not feeling good or optimistic at this time. Love and light to everyone MaryQ X",

      "Content": "I wonder if anyone out there has experienced this.  Three years ago I had a mastectomy for lobular stage 2 Invasive cancer. Since then I have once or twice been back to the clinic for lumpy bits and a cyst in the other side, but they did say to keep going back... I felt a bit guilty going back this time but I am glad I did.  It seems that underneath the cyst they think it is a fibroadenoma and I need to have a core biopsy.  But it is of course possible that there is something lurking there as last time it was very hard to see. Also it could be a phyllodes tumour I suppose. I am thinking that if I have to have any sort of surgery for any diagnosis (lump removal) I would ask for a second mastectomy because I cannot imagine going through all this again in 5 or 10 years (I am 67). Next Friday is my biopsy and I have fluctuated between real fear and a disconnected feeling.    Can anyone help out there? MaryQ x",
