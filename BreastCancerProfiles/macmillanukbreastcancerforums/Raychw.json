    "Content": "I go in for mastectomy surgery on Tuesday - my surgeon says it could be day surgery! or I can stay in for a day or two if I want.  Please can anyone advise me about how they felt after surgery  - is going home really a possibility - or should i stay in at least overnight.  My concern is that if i'm still woosey from anaesthetic I may not understand what i\"m being told about meds, drains, anything else I need to look out for  -any thoughts?",
