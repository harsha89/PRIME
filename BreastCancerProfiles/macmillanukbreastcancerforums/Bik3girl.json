      "Content": "Hi Lynn thank you so much for your response which has give hope and a fresh perspective  about whether  to proceed with RT. Until now I have only been given all the negative outcomes by my consultant which has really been effecting my decision. I know they need to provide us with all the possible outcomes but I just feel that these have all been negative so far and your response has at least given me some hope of a positive  outcome. I have an appoint this Friday with RT consultant to discuss whether to proceed or not so I am now prepared to go and be more open minded about proceeding with RT much to my daughters relief . Many thanks Denise x",

      "Content": "Good morning, I have recently  had a masectomy  with  immediate breast reconstruction but due to tight margins have been advise to consider  radiotherapy however due to that fact this could result in destroying  the reconstruction and that there are no guarantees either way and my lymph nodes are clear I'm not sure that I want to proceed with the radiotherapy.  Have any of you ladies faced the same option and if you had radiotherapy  what has been the outcome. I'm currently  waiting for an appointment  to see the radiotherapsite to discuss  my options. Any feed back would be much appreciated. ",

      "Content": "Hi Gay Yes I have had an implant at the same time as my masectomy and my lymph nodes are clear. My consultant  now wants me to consider radiotherapy  and indicated that this will more than likely affect the implant over time. I'm  glad to hear that your implant does not appear to have been affected by the radiotherapy,  could I ask how you found the radiotherapy, did you find it tiring and did it affect you skin? Thank you for you help. Denise x",
