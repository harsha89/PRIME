    "Content": ". I know exactly how you feel although our situation is reversed , oncologists are adamant that the children should not be protected but when years can pass without anything changing I don't see the point of sharing your uncertainty. Its my 12 year old who has the cancer ( with a lesser chance of recovery than yours by the sound of it ) he has a twin and 2 other siblings ( 16 and 21). My eldest knows , my 16 year old asked me not to tell her anything until it was certain ( we had alsorts of false pos and false negs in the beginning) and we have decided that as at the moment he is without symptoms and going to school as usual, we will wait until he either asks direct or becomes so ill its all not so far in the future. god luck with everything. sarah",
