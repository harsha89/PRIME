The hospital gave me sharps bin after my first cycle, so it already has a couple of used needles in. However.. I\u2019m going to stay with my parents next weekend- when I still need to do the injections. Can I close the flap/lid on the bin to stop the needles coming out, and reopen once I\u2019m at my parents.. or is it a case of once it\u2019s closed, that\u2019s it, not to be re-opened? Many thanks! (Also pasted on chemo chat group but this one seems to be more active!)",

I wanted to be ab,e to answer their questions and not have to say I don\u2019t know etc so I know how you feel.  Take me all the help that you can get/ are offfereed... one thing I\u2019ve learnt on my journey is who your true friends are, rely on their support and take advantage of it. Unfortunately it\u2019s opened my eyes, but I now have a strong group of friends I can really rely on and trust 110%. thebreast care nurses are fantastic as well, the knowledge etc is great, but also don\u2019t forget people on here- we are note medical professionals but have been there done it a lot of the time, or will have an input, even if it\u2019s just a virtual hug when needed... keep talking !!!!   Xx",
