    "Content": "Hi sammystaff  I saw your post and had to reply. I was regraded to Grade 4 after a scan which found  small nodules on my lung and liver. After several more scans, these were found to be not growing or changing in any way and they have decided they are just scars or innocent blemishes and are no longer worried about them at all. They are just being thorough. Try not to be alarmed. We all have lots of these and the scans can pick up on innocent lumps and bumps all the time. love flamingo",
