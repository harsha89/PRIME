      "Content": "Hi Londonmumof2, I'm taking Abemaciclib which is currently successfully  used to help patients who already have mets.  This trial is to see if it helps prevent reoccurrence in people with early stage breast cancer.  As I was node positive and with the recent history of losing my hubby, it's been a no brainer for me.  Obviously means more trips/tests etc, but on plus side, I feel less like I have been left on a cliff edge after treatment.  Gail x",

      "Content": "Hi Alice,  I have just recently finished my active treatment for grade 3 oestrogen positive IDC.   I had a WLE and axillary node clearance  followed by chemo and rads.  I had 5 of 15 nodes positive.  I am on 10yrs of Tamoxifen /Letrazole and soon to start 6mthly bisphosphonates.   I too  was offerred a clinical trial at the beg of treatment which meant that I may have escaped chemo, but as I had just lost my husband to lung cancer and with 2 teenage boys, I needed belt and braces treatment.  I felt I couldn't risk them saying at the end of the trial that I would have benefited from chemo. I am now on another trial and have been randomised into a group to take tablets that may help recurrence.  Should you need chemo and rads there will be plenty of support on here for you and although scary now, it is doable and you will get through it. I wish I could tell you not to worry about possible spread, but that would be impossible.   The only thing I can say is that hopefully your sentinel nodes will have done their job in helping to prevent any spread.   I would urge you only to look on reputable web sites if you read up on the Internet such as Macmillan and Cancer Research.  Do try to take things one day at a time until you know for sure what you will be dealing with and I know first hand that that is easier said than done.   Do let us know how you get on and remember that we're here for you.
