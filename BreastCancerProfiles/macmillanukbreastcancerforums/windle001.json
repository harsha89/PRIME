It grows pretty quickly although it came back sooooo grey. My eyelashes came back but quite sparse so I got them tattooed, I wish I had done that years ago.",

      "Content": "I was diagnosed with breast cancer March 2013, had a mastectomy and then chemo. I was advised to ask for help financially as I worked two jobs to pay my mortgage and support my children. The only help I got was that my mortgage company would reduce my payments whilst I was unable to do both my jobs. Now a year later this is ending my mortgage payments have risen by over £200 a month I am still unable to work my original 70 hours a week but yet I am still getting punished. Why is there no help for hard working people who try and pay their bills an mortgage each month. In my 48 years I have never claimed ANYTHING from the government, I am disgusted and ashamed with the government. Everyone says you can get help and all these organisations will assist you, THEY WILL NOT. I am sorry but I had to put this in writing as I am have been so let down!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    ",
