      "Content": "Hi there, sorry to hear your daughter has got chicken pox. I think it's quite rare though to get it a second time, so you should be OK (I saw on the NHS Wales website that 90% of adults are immune to chicken pox).   I only had very mild chicken pox when I was a child, according to my mum, and I was surprised when I found that I seemed to have caught chicken pox a second time when my children got it last year (I hadn't taken much care to avoid getting it). So basically, you need to be careful just in case.  It might be worth checking with your unit/GP to see if you can get a blood test to find out if you are immune (and help put your mind at rest).  Sorry you'er having to deal with this extra stress -  I had an Impetigo scare with my son last week and it really shook me.    Good luck with it all xx",
