      "Content": "Hi...I ran a marathon last may 2 days after biopsy and diagnosis so I was fairly fit at the start of chemo. I did a fair bit of walking during chemo and I managed to do short runs in weeks 2 or 3 ( although they got shorter and slower). I have a treadmill at home which was a godsend as I didn't feel confident enough to run outside in case I felt rough. I managed to do a fairly slow 10k  3 months after radiotherapy and am now training for a half marathon  6 months post chemo. I also went back to playing centre in netball a month after treatment. Running has been my saviour throughout all this. However a word of caution....I know I rushed it as I was desperate to get back to normal....I was back teaching full time during radio and I still get very tired.  I have aches and pains which could be letrozole related or sports related and I often worry that the rib paiin is a spread! So sport is great but you will ache from it and it is just a little harder than before.   Although I am 46 now and still try to live like a 25 year old which is half the problem I think!! Do what your body can cope with and be kind to yourself xx",
