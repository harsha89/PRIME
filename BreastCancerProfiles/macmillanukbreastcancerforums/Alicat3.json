    "Content": "Hi Susie! I've been taking Letrezole for nearly six months now and I decided to take it at 10 pm - I reckoned that was a good time for me to remember it daily, some time between supper and bedtime, and that any immediate side effects would get me while I sleep! I've had some liver function problems with it as well as some depression, which seems to be getting better about now. I'm not sure whether my oncologist will confirm it when I see her in May or switch me over to something else, depending on how the next set of blood Tests go. I'm happy with my choice of time of day, though!  let us know how you get on! Best, Alison",
