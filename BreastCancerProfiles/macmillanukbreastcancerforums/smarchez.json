      "Content": "Hi Pootlecav.  I don't want to undermine how you're feeling or to minimise it in any way, but could the drugs that you are taking be adding to your depressed state?  I think (not that I know much) that depression can be one of the side effects of Tamoxifen (and maybe the other one too?).  I left an unhappy marriage many years ago.  I had a tough time but, at no time, no matter how tough it got, did I ever regret leaving.  I would say, don't make any decisions right now.  Carry on fighting the fight that's the most important at the moment and put any big decisions off.  I think you should go back to your doctor and tell them exactly how you are feeling and that you're not ready to go back to work.  Perhaps, when you feel a bit more like it, it will do you good to get back to the real world (assuming you meet people while you're at work?).  There are lots of avenues open to you for help.  If you live in the UK (?), then there's Samaritans - they're not just for people who are suicidal -, Macmillan helpline, and talk to your doctor about getting some counselling/therapy (or if you can afford it, pay for it as you'll get it more quickly).  But get some help.  You can't be alone at the moment and deal with all of this yourself.  Reach out - there's plenty of help available and the people on this site are amazing!  Hugs, smarchez",

      "Content": "Hello there Hels_Bels.  I'm sorry for the delay in replying.  I saw your post when it came on and then I couldn't find it again and have been looking for it ever since! Since I posted I've read a lot about the test.  I'm not yet sure whether my insurance company will cover it (I don't have national health here) so will make a decision once I hear from them.  Do keep in touch, if you have the time, and let me know how you get on.  Have you started your chemo yet? How are you feeling? smarchez",

      "Content": "Hi all.  I'm waiting to hear whether I'm going to need chemo.  I'll find out on 25 July.  I will be having radiotherapy and hormone treatment but they want to rule out chemo (by my seeing a medical oncologist).  I saw the radiotherapy oncologist a couple of days ago and she won't let me start treatment until the medical oncologist has ruled out (hopefully!) chemo.  Apparently, I'm a bit borderline.  (We live in Spain and I don't know if it's dealt with differently here.....?)  If the tumour is Grade I and less than 1 cm, then it's no chemo.  My tumour was 1.1 cm and Grade II, so they need to be certain that I'm OK without chemo.  (I had 3 sentinel nodes removed, which were all clear, as well as a lumpectomy.) I don't know what they will be doing to check (blood tests??) as something may have got lost in the translation (oncologist's average English and our average Spanish).  I am taking a medical translator to my appointment with the medical oncologist as he speaks no English.  I wondered if anyone was in a similar position? Or had a similar pathology and so was able to tell me whether they had chemo or not?  Obviously, I'm worried and not looking forward to waiting til 25 July to find out.....",

      "Content": "Hi Margieb Thank you so much for making contact and telling me your story.  I'd be really interested in keeping in touch, particularly as our circumstances are very similar (in terms of tumour, proposed treatment etc) and the fact that you live in Spain.  I'll send you a friend request so that we can keep in touch more easily.  We are down in the South (Axarquia).  We can't get the Spanish NHS yet as we're not pensionistas so we pay for private health insurance.  Have had good treatment (I think! Nothing much to compare it with!) but nothing in the way of post-surgery support (e.g. I don't have a GP or breast care nurse or any support group) which is why this site is absolutely invaluable to me. Holland was one of the options that I was offered but the one that the oncologist is proposing now is to send it more locally (Malaga).  I think you're very brave to refuse the chemo but I can completely understand why you would do that.  It's a tough decision.  Sometimes I think it's easier if they make these decisions for us (!) because then the risk/blame (whatever you want to call it) can be taken out of our hands... but I'm just rambling because I know, really, that information is power and the more we know, the better more informed decisions we can take.  I'm just wondering at what point (if I have the test) I would decide that chemo is the best thing for me.  I know what you mean about hot flushes and the weather.  I don't think I'd know what I'd be having either!  I feel like I'm having a hot flush for most of the day and night at the moment with how hot it's been.   I hope that you're feeling well.  How is your Spanish?  Have you managed to navigate the various appointments on your own in Spanish? Sending a friend request now.  smarchez",
