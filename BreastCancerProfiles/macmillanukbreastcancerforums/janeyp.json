    "Content": "Hi Lorna, my sister had it almost 10 yrs ago when she was 29 (4 weeks before she got married). She had lumpectomy and lymph nodes removed, chemo and r/t. She went ahead with the wedding as the surgeon did the op before it. Then almost 2 years ago had a beautiful baby. Stay strong and positive. janexx",
