There is quite a good write up on it on the cancer research uk site. The data does take a bit of a while to process and to be interpreted, do you know when they expect to give you the results - will it be just before the operation? As to when you should take the Valium is an hour before what your GP advised, from a quick scan on the net that seems to be fairly normal. The only time I have had it was just before I had an angigram. Do talk to the medics at the MRI, they are used to people having issues and are expert in helping people cope. <<hugs>> Steve",

After she collapsed and had an emergency hysterectomy he eventually diagnosed pyometra - common in dogs, rare in people. It all but killed her - but it is not cancer. She has a fairly hazy memory of all this since she was being so badly poisoned, I on the other hand saw it sooo clearly - is there anyone supporting you? What you have is something, it sound like it could be quite serious and you are getting it checked out - absolutly fantastic. It might be cancer is might not, whatever it is you are dealing with it as best you can and at least with the suspicion it might be cancer you get an urgent appointment. One quote I quite like is \u201cWorrying does not take away tomorrow\u2019s troubles. It takes away today\u2019s peace.\u201d Hope the appointment comes through soon and whatever path you need to walk in the future becomes more clear. <<hugs>> Steve",

When she started to lose her hair she had it cut short and ended up losing all the hair on her head and went for a scaft or just bald and proud. After the chemo her hair grew back quite quickly and with a bit of a curl that she quite liked but not it has returned to \"normality\".

The only thing that made me feel a little uncomfortable in the report was it might be seen to suggest that spread means incurable and then incurable means people will die of cancer, perhaps that could have been written with a touch more sensitivity. <<hugs>> Steve ",

She is among one of the most thoroughly scanned, checked, documented, probed, prodded, people in the country, if anything were to show up I am sure they would be on top of it. For most of us of course we simply don't know and it is often said ignorance is bliss. She got her appointment yesterday for her next meeting with the oncologist, 24th February and a sensible time too, so that's bound to move, a day after my appointment with the rheumatologist.

Of course there is next to nothing like a fact in the real world, it is all shades of grey. It is very important to listen carefully to your oncologist but to also ask questions say can you show me why you say that, look at all the risks and make your own mind up. If you consider doing complementary medecine (ie something alongside conventional) then talk to your oncologist because sometimes there can be interactions but if it does no harm I have yet to find one who would stop you, since they cannot, but perhaps don't expect them to be overflowing with support. You might consider doing nothing, in fact for some slow growing cancers that are not actually causing any problems that is often the best thing but often people plea for treatment. The trouble with your rebutal of my comment is simple I said take 1000 vegans and some of them will get cancer - most of them won't. Take 1000 meat eaters and some of them will get cancer, a few more than the vegan group. Your answer is 1 person did not get cancer. Any decision made by a cancer sufferer show courage, to go for treatment, to not go for treatment, whatever and for them whatever decision and however they made it is the right one. The one fact in life is at the end we all die, so on that cheery note I wish you farewell. Steve",

Sorry you are having such problems though perhaps one thought on a slow growing tumour is that in the diagnostic tests you are trying to tell the difference between normal cells and cells that are a tiny bit different.  While I am not a medical specialist the work I do on analysing space images can be similarly challenging. <<hugs>> Steve",

I see you have used the ask the nurse so hopefully you will get an answer there before too long, though of course there is noone on duty over the weekend. It is such a shame they did not explain about the marker, we do tend to imagine all sorts of reasons always the worst possible and doubt is our worst enemy. The good news in your message is that the chemo is still going ahead. <<hugs>> Steve",
