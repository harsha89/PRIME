      "Content": "Hi  there is a lot of  info on diet which can be very overwhelming . The best advice I have had  is to maintain a healthy weight and do some light/ moderate exercise for 30 mins every day. I joined a.Trial when I started my chemo looking at weight gain in ladies on chemo. I was randomly selected to follow a Mediterranean diet which I have done. I have managed to loose some weight whilst on chemo and most days managed to either walk or go to the gym. I will definitely carry on following the diet now I have finished chemo and hopefully continue to drop a few more pounds when my energy levels improve . I was at the top end of a healthy weight when I started the chemo and have maintained a healthy appetite throughout . I can't say I have felt deprived of anything and I still enjoy \"wine o'clock \" on a regular basis. One of the challenges whilst on treatment is to keep active which can be very difficult when you have mega side effects . I was also advised not to eat certain foods throughout treatment like prawns/ raw fish runny eggs ,unpasteurised cheese , bio yogurts and certain cheese . Looking forward to my first soft egg and soldiers for breakfast very soon just giving myself 6 weeks from last chemo yummy. Hope some of this helps. regards Liz",

No one mentioned this side effect to me so I was totally taken by surprise  4 weeks in on the Paclitaxel . I was eventually prescribed Pregablin which worked immediately. I was told by one of the chemo nurses the 9 taxol would be a walk in the park compared to the Fec but not for me. My bloods got so low treatment was delayed by two weeks and then reduced by 20%. I am now 5 weels post chemo and dealing with labrynthitis . I have weaned myself off Pregablin and on Letrozole and Risedronate. My energy levels and pains are worse than on the chemo I have not been able to exercise this week due to the dizziness and fatigue . I will take a look at your blog wished I had known about the complimenta.rybtherapies before I started my regime. I have been following a meditatranean diet throughout chemo and found this really good and even managed to loose a few pounds to boot. regards Liz",

I got an Audi pillow from Aldi as a present and that was much better than headphones so comfy and no complaints from other half about noise seepage. The only thing was it took me ages to get through a book as I kept falling asleep and missed whole chunks of the story. Still got my monies worth and some rest as well. I found going out for short periods helped coffee or shops took my mind off things. I know what you mean about not being able to concentrate I was the same TV or films had no interest. Quite liked plYing games on my phone though they got quite addictive.  Good luck  Regards Liz",

I also found Difflam mouthwash very good . Both of these my Doc prescribed also Difflam spray is really good as you can get it down your throat . The really good stuff is Caphosol you can use this several times a day but it does dry out the mouth so you will need the Biotene to replace the moisture. regards Liz  ",

The thing is it did dry my mouth out so had to use Biotene gel . You can get Biotene mouthwash and toothpaste I never used either but suspect it would be okay if the gel is anything to go by. I brushed with a small soft head toothbrush three times a day at least. I also had the nystatin oral drops for oral thrush which worked well Good luck with it  Regards Liz",

I am using also rats of creams and potions to no avail. I am hoping when the treatment finishes things will improve I would hold off on the plastic surgery for awhile. You could try a course of non surgical face lifts if you can get anyone to touch you whilst having treatment. My vision as been affected as well along with my bladder control . I wish you well don't do anything hasty you will need all your energies to complete the chemo. Keep us posted . regards Liz",
