      "Content": "Hi Emaline, I had lumpectomy and clearance of the lymph nodes under my arm. I think it is different for everyone but I'm sure that, if they felt it was too big for a lumpectomy, you would have been advised for something else.Â  I don't want to put a damper on things but I think \"within a week\" is a little ambitious for returning. You will be sore and bruised. I had a small semi circular scar around the nipple and a longer, deep four inch jobbie under my arm. I guess it depends what sort of work you do but listen to your specialists and to your body. I'm retired but do some occasional relief work and I didn't feel I could have done that for around a month, partly due to needing to drive and heave a vehicle round. By the time you read this I'm guessing you'll have had your op and hope you are feeling okay. I know you might not feel like it first off, but do follow the exercise routine they should give you to get your arm and shoulder moving again. Very best wishes.",
