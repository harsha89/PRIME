      "Content": "Hi Fretty so sorry to hear of your situation which is similar to mine. I was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2012. Had lump and lymph nodes removed, chemo and then radio then in May/June of this year returned to my neck found by Ultra sound and biopsy. Had a CT scan and will be starting 6 weeks of intensive radio on the neck on Monday 15th July. I've been told that this may not clear it and if it does may \"pop\" up again somewhere else which is not what I wanted to hear. However there are other treatments which we can be given including more chemo and hormone tablets so please try to be positive. I have contacted a few other people that are in similar situations as us and some have lived full and active lives for years and years and still going strong so don't loose heart. Good luck with the scan.",

      "Content": "Morning all, went for my 1st Docetaxel yesterday. Saw the onc first who satisfied my fears. Giving me 20% less as I was so sick on my 1st FEC and ended up in hospital for a week netropenic and with infection. So 2nd and 3rd FEC reduced by 20%. Also given emend for sickness which worked well on the FEC and seems to be doing the same with this, and most importantly to be given the one off injection today by district nurse for infection which I also had with FEC following my 1st disaster which solves my problem of having to inject myself, NO WAY which I blogged on here about which all you lovely ladies tried to help me with your own experiences but which I still couldn\u2019t get my head around. So all in all RESULT. Apart from feeling spaced out and tired at present feeling OK, just waiting for the side effects to kick in whatever they may be but He Ho the joys of chemo! After spending 8 hours at the hospital yesterday with husband came home and relaxed with a non alcoholic beer (Blue Becks) whilst husband prepared and cooked dinner, he\u2019s a star. Hope you all are coping OK will let you all know how I go!",

I still got aching bones which I was given tramadol and sore mouth (thrush) which I was given nystan, both worked well and kept me active. Horrid taste buds forced me to eat mostly sweet things which I would not normally eat but he ho what a price to pay! I\u2019m sure you will also find you can handle this last stage. The chemo generally has an accumulative effect so gets a bit harder each time to recover but get there I do and as for understanding if the reduced dose works as good, my idea is how can something that gives us such horrid side effects NOT WORK! Good luck and keep positive soon be over.",

I have very narrow veins and apart from the problems with insertion (several attempts each time) I am needle phobic and experienced constant pain. I had my last chemo last week (yippee) and having the PICC line put in was the best decision I have made. As already advised all the chemo goes through the line and the bloods come out so no more painful insertions. I experienced most of the different side effects with chemo but with the help of medication was able to cope so make sure you shout nobody mines and there\u2019s a lot of help out there.

I\u2019m lucky that I\u2019ve had all the surgery done prior to having chemo and should now only need radio and then the hormone tablets. Been looking at holidays for next year as had to cancel all for this year when diagnosed but thinking mustn\u2019t run before I can walk. As everyone says we are all different and recovery will be different for each of us but it is still very frustrating. It\u2019s a bit like the mind is willing but the flesh is weak. Here\u2019s hoping that following your surgery you start to get better and stronger day by day and that all this horror will soon be a distant memory. When you feel like it please keep us posted on your recovery and again good luck with tomorrow I will be thinking of you. Hugs",

I have had 2 ops the last one to remove 14 lymph nodes which has left me with a manageable but niggly nerve pain. If anyone has any experience of this please advise. Anyhow last week I had my first of 3 FEC-T chemo's which was horrible. I was unable to eat, sleep or do anything much for 4/5 days. Got very depressed and tearful which was not nice for my husband who with my family and friends is doing a fantatic job of looking after and encouraging me. I am OK now but not looking forward to the rest.

The PICC line can also be used for blood tests and in my case in hospital for anti biotics due to low white blood cell count which for me works great as I have very narrow veins and they are hard to detect so always end up black and blue and very scared. So glad I made the investment. FEC 3 is next week (1/2 way yepee) then onto Docetaxel for 3 lots. Once the lines in I am visited by the district nurse once a week who cleans and redresses it. I've had no problems with it so far. They provide you with a \"Limbo\" which is an arm sleeve to cover for shower use.

Was given Anastrozole as the hormone suppressant but did not agree with me so was then given Exemestane which I\u2019ve been on for two weeks but the verdict is still out as to whether this is the correct one for me. By painting my finger and toe nails before having \u201cT\u201d and ever since I can report that I still have all nails albeit slightly discoloured. I think I will continue with this for another month before going \u201cnude\u201d. I was lucky to be accepted to the \u201cFAST FORWARD\u201d programme and instead of having three weeks of radio I only had 1 week which finished the end of November and I can report no problems. I showered with simple soap and moisturised with Aloe Vera gel (99.9%) and aqueous cream given to me by the hospital. On finishing the chemo I was given a bone density scan which revealed that I had osteoporosis which has meant that I am now on Alendronic Acid and Calcichew-D3 to help replace/repair the reduced bone mass. Following the chemo end of November I still suffer from extremely bad muscle/bone ache and have to take Tramadol for the pain albeit lower dose now ( 2 tablets a day) but desperately want to get off these and get on with my life. I have appointments with the chemo onc at the end of January and the radio onc beginning of February when I hope I will get some sense! Apart from that I\u2019m OK.

      "Content": "Hi Julie is was the same as me. However doc gave me Tramadol for the pain which worked but try not to get too dependent on it as takes a while to get off (narcotic). Not sure about the cough would be good idea to ask at same time as asking for stronger pain killers. I had sore mouth and throat and was given Nystatin which also worked. Don't suffer there's always something they can give you for the side affects. Hope you soon get sorted, hugsxx",
