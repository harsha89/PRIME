      "Content": "Interesting to read this post and Jacky's reply because I'm going to see my brilliant plastic surgeon again in May and I know he wants to make me a nipple but I also know he's a perfectionist and may want to make adjustments by lipomodelling.  I was feeling like Cooden 7 thinking \"no more surgery\", after all no one is going to see me without a bra!  However, reading the reply has made me think I should go for it so thank you both for discussing this next step of the journey that is breast cancer.",

      "Content": "Sounds like we're both in the same boat at the same time Cooden 7.   I had my TRAM flap reconstruction in October and going back to see my surgeon on 7th May.  I feel exactly the same as you so if you do it, I'll do it and we can support each other!  I'm going to a talk for post op patients at the Breat Reconstruction Group tonight so I'll post on here if I find out anything interesting.",
