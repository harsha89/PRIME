    "Content": "Hi I had my mastectomy three weeks ago and my breast care nurse told me that the proper bras are very expensive and she has known allot of her patients to buy them from eBay. I bought one and have put my softie inside and my nurse told me to just pin it inside so it doesn't fall out. The fact that it's a front fastener helps too. Have a look and the best partcis the price 8.99!!!!! Good luck x 180973392220 type this number into the eBay search box.",
