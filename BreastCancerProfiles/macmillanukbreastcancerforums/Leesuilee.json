      "Content": "Hi I was told there was no 'best time' to take it but I take it at night as I will be working shifts when I return. I get major problems regulating my body temperature and night cramps. I was advised to drink a small bottle of tonic water each day and I haven't had cramp since. I also bought a 'chillow' from EBay and haven't woken up drenched in sweat since! Well worth the £18.99 hope this helps xx",

I haven't had any scans and assumed this was because all the nasties were surgically removed and then as a 'belt and braces' approach with chemo/rads. Hope this helps xx",

I had some hair breakage at the crown and have only realised now it's growing back that I lost a line right around my hairline. Well worth trying - no one realised I was having treatment - although some people find it painful and/or incredibly uncomfortable - wish I could post a pic of my hair 6 months afterwards. Good luck",

The smell, texture and taste of food made me feel sick and it's still difficult for me now. I have been sick about 3 times a week since September, my oncologist says this is not related to chemo and suggested I had a endoscopy. I'd ask your onc for advice Regards Lesley",

It's infuriating,  no one asked to get cancer, have the treatments and feel rubbish. It took 2014 away from me. But 2015 is MINE!!! The counselling helped me see that it's perfectly normal to feel like this, it's like PTSD, but if you think about it it's all utterly traumatic. But we're still here, if a bit scarred, singed and tired. Xx",
