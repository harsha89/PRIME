      "Content": "Hi Lady Muck,I'm new too!I was diagnosed on 3rd July after a routine mammogram, I am going for a CT scan on 13th and having free TRAM surgery on 23rd August. I really dont know a lot about breast cancer even though I am a nurse myself!! I just wish it was all over with, and have spent July in a dream, dont think it has actually hit me yet as I am very calm??? Is this normal?? Are you calm?? lol. anyway, they did other biopsies and they were positive too so its full mastectomy. Regards, Sunnysmiler! I",

      "Content": "Hi, I know how you feel about telling your parents, I was dreading it, my mum is 81, very healthy and active and a great support to us all. I told her 4 weeks after I was diagnosed, it was really hard as i see her every day, but I didnt see the point in telling her until after her hols, then there was a family gathering so I waited till that was all over. I wont say it was easy cause it wasn't, but I felt as if a great weight had been lifted off my shoulders, poor mum, put unto hers. I was very upbeat about it and showed her how positive I am. Every time I thought about telling her my stomach did a double somersault!! I have to go for a scan on Monday which I haven't told her about as I dont want her worrying unnecessarily. I am 52 so a good bit older than you, so dont know how your parents will react but I am sure they will be behind you all the way. once you tell them it will be easier on you. Let me know how you get on. x",
