I just don't know, I am going to a Demystifying Chemo session on Thursday after my pre Chemo appointment with the oncologist, maybe they will help. Thanks for listening.",

I have been going over the question, chemo yes/no, I have spoken to my family and made a list of for and against but keep coming back to the fact that I cannot see the benefits. I am going to have radio and HRT and my last results showed no cancer in the nodes. Anyone else said no to chemo? I would be grateful for your thoughts. Thanks.",
