    "Content": "Just popped over from the womb group to say yes, the LGFG courses are great. The ladies who taught the course in my area were lovely and the bag of freebies was amazing -all good, reputable makes.  We had to say whether we had fair, medium or dark complexion when we booked and the contents of individual bags reflected this.  There was even a full size bottle of perfume! There were 9 of us in the group and we had lots of opportunities to ask  questions. Prior to my diagnosis i only ever wore a little bit of mascara. The tutors demonstrated different techniques using everyone the group as models (a different product/technique on each person) and came round to help & advise as we practised. I don't wear makeup every day but I feel more confident now about applying it. Everyone was very supportive of each other and it proved to be an afternoon of fun and laughter!  My daughters were very complimentary when I sent them a photo of my makeup straight after the session! Hope you enjoy your LGFG session. ",
