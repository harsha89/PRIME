    "Content": "Hi there When I had my Grade 2 breast lump removed it was by 'wide angle incision' rather than a hole refilled with body fat. Basically I have a scar line and then another where the nodes were removed for testing. The breast that was was operated on is actually quite pert, following radiotherapy, and at the moment the other one is slightly dipping southwards but I notice, tho others dont seem to. My Consultant has offered to do something with the 'southfacing' one if it starts to bother me. At the moment Ive got sizeable breasts anyway due to the Tamoxifen I was on which made me gain lots of weight; Ive now switched to Arimidex. Its this that bothers me more than the scars. Suggest you discuss your anxieties with your medics; Im sure they'll be able to help and put your mind at rest. Love and Luck x        ",
