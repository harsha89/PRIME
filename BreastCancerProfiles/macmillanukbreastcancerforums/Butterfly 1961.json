      "Content": "Hi , I got the aloe Vera from H & B and I could not use it as I thought the smell was terrible. I went back to the shop to enquire did I get a one from a bad batch but the assistant did not know how they smell. A friend of mine brought me back some 100% aloe Vera from lanzarotte and it is great. Take care",

      "Content": "Hi, I was on day 6 of rads yesterday and I too have a pain in the opposite arm, but it is the whole arm. I said it to the nurses yesterday and they thought it was strange cos it is not on the same side that is been treated.they think maybe it is because of the angle the arms are, while getting treatment. Will have to wait and see if it improves or gets worse. Boob also now starting to redden up and I am lashing on the aqueous cream and aloa Vera. Take care",

      "Content": "Hi, took me a while to have the courage to join, but have been getting great support from reading all the questions and answers.. As I had turned 50 last year I was given a free mammogram on Jan 13 th 2012 which was normal, but since I turned 40 I have been getting free mammograms every 2 years with my work. Well the work mammogram was on May 18th 2012 and as I had already have one done I really should not have had another but something made me go and it was then my cancer was spotted. Had ultrasound and biopsy on 12th June, results on 26 th June. Invasive Ductal Cancer, er and something else positive, Her 2 neg.. Lumpectomy and. 5 lymph nodes removed on 9 th July. margins clear and no nodes involved. So Tamoxifen for 5 years and 15 sessions of radiotherapy. I have started the Tamoxifen about 3 weeks ago and so far 4 sessions of rads. Gosh 4 months ago I did not even know what half of these words ment. How quick we learn. Like all of us it was a big shock, but I have been positive , maybe too positive as I still don't really think this has happened to me. I understand all what has happened but wish I could have a big cry over it. It worries me as I have not cried yet. Then I feel guilty cos I know how lucky I am and there are many more worse then me. Can't pinpoint my feelings, just feel numb about the whole breast cancer thing.The Tamoxifen side effects are crap. A hot flush that starts in my feet and works its way up and then from my waist to head feel I am on fire, and the sweat on the face and neck. Also hips pain very bad at night. The rads are fine getting done ( can't find any fault with any of the nurses) all so lovely , thoughtfull and caring , (we were given gowns to bring with us each day ) but since first rad have been getting sharp pains in my boob. Is this normal. Putting lots of that aqueous cream on .Would like to hear from others. Sorry this is so long, felt good to write everything down, pity I forgot to stop. Thanks for listening to me.
