      "Content": "I was diagnosed yeasterday with invasive lobular carcinoma, its pread to my lymphnodes too and has a couple of axtra bits thrown in there too! Waiting for MRI resuls but have to have double mastectomy in next few days. Am so scared and cant show it espoecially as my husband lost his mum to cancer when he was 12... I am mum of 5 and nanny to 2 newborn baby boys...I am only 36 and wondering just how bad this really is. All this has happened within 3 weeks; needle biopsy, G/A open biopsy, mammograms (lots of) scans and mri! Does anyone else have ILC?",

      "Content": "Thank you so much for your reply... I have been told i have to have a double mastectomy straight away and then treatments afterwards. Lymph nodes all got to go too.Â  Am worried that as I was diagnosed during xmas and he isn't telling me everything. I have done alot of research into ILC and I think that a full double mastectomy seems a bit drastic.. maybe I'm wrong but I have this gut feeling, the one I've had all along that this is worse than we feared. The staff have been fab but the consultant although very good has been a bit elusive about what lies ahead for me. I also have this huge sense of just wanting to get rid and throw everything at this sucker to make sure it goes! I am so stubborn and have been through so much in my life that I am going to be super positive and give it my best shot...have just got this horrible gut feeling though......................... Sending lots of ove and best wishes to you too. madkat1",
