      "Content": "Hello Everyone. I am all new to this!. My Mum recently was diagnosed with breast cancer thankfully it was spotted on her first ever scan! she had her operation a few weeks back and she had her first chemo session yesterday. she has also had appointments beforehand and the nurses have discussed what she can and cant eat. the problem is my mum felt that they were not helpful as one minute she was told she couldn't have milk and the next they say she can. they hadn't written anything down and she is having trouble remembering what they had told her. I was just wondering if anyone knows what she will be able to eat and drink and what to avoid, I have tried to look online but every website is different. Also as she is having only 3 sessions of chemo is she likely to lose her hair?. My mum also keeps asking me if she is going to die and I really don't know how to deal with these questions! I would be very grateful if anyone could help me Vicky",
