However  I let it out  and then normality seems to come back to me. It's good to let it out  then try and get on with things. I try to tell myself worrying will change nothing and only waste precious time which sometimes brings me back again. I was diagnosed end of April and still waiting on node biopsy before they can set out my treatment path, waiting is the worst x x",

Mine started coming out day 14 after first cycle so my sister in law but it short they shaved it at a number 2 four days later  there was quite alot left but was beginning to get patchy. The small hair are actually worse than long ones  as the clung to my sleep hats I ordered for Anna bandana so I went to a nought few days later. I wear my wig constantly unless sleeping and it's easy to forget it's there. My girls still fiddle with my hair (wig)  lol  due my 3rd cycle next Thursday and have stubble on head  now wondering does it all go or might the stubble continue to grow.  If you shave it  you'll be grand in day or two honestly x x",

Wasn't given any of the advice someone listed above, have generally been carrying on as normal with head down.

Can a throbbing gum lead to infection? Tooth is already dead as had root canal etc over 20  years ago so know it's not tooth",

Was in hospital for 3 nights and got drains out before went home. I did the exercises given and didn't drive for 4 weeks, but went to Portugal after week 3 :-). But I had no pain or complaints. It was uncomfortable at times but I didn't need pain killers once home from hospital. You have been through so much all ready and I know each case is different and I had a brilliant surgeon but if you need to go down that route it is totally manageable and not the worst thing in the world to look at lol Love daisy x x",

Would rather put some weight on now incase I have other side affects with other cycles and can't eat. I thought the steroids were part of the anti sickness regime but maybe not.",

      "Content": "Excellent post Katie  love the humour lol  one tip I have is  if your hair is long put it in a bobble at night  that way your finding your hair in your brush and not on your pillow. Another one is  when you get round to shaving hair, I got fed up with it coming out after 3 days, watch something like sister act with your best buddy and sing and have a laugh and experiment with shorter styles for the evening. Really takes the pain out of going from long to a sinead oConnor do. I actually sat with  earphones in singing my heart out(badly) while she shaved  it also made the terrible task easier for her. Wig has been worn since yesterday morning and I'm well chuffed with it :-). another must do  if your only affected on one breast be sure and totally  familiarise yourself with your other one  before you start chemo, wish I had done it now  as don't know what it was like before and am constantly checking for lumps.   If I think of anything else I'll post. Good luck :-) x x",
