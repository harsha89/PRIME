    "Content": "Have had 4 EC and was supposed to have 4 Tax - had 1 Tax with no issues and then during start of 2nd Tax had allergic reaction even though I took prescribed steroids and so they had to stop the treatment.  Going back in a few weeks to have 2nd treatment again but of Abraxane but I've never seen any posts detailing this drug.  Has anyone had this drug and if so what are the side effects",
