      "Content": "Hi Elena I've just finished my 3rd FEC and have only experienced nausea once, but that was because I didn't take my anti sickness tab soon enough. I'm on ondansitron which I have to take for 2 days after chemo, and domperidone which I take when necessary. They really work for me so it's definitely worth telling the nurses you are suffering as there are many more you can try. There is nothing worse in my book than feeling sick, and I sympathise with you ... but I'm sure you can change your tablets, give them a call.  My side effects seem to be all in my head, dizzy, achey,  can't bend down and as a result unable to walk anywhere without feeling like I'm falling over ! Thankfully only lasts about 5 days or so. Then I just sleep lol . You're not being a wuss, call them xxx good luck Jane ",

      "Content": "Please don't feel that you cant go on with the treatment, I'm sure you are stronger than you realise. Separation and moving house are the 2 most stressful events in life, so its no wonder you feel like you do, its only natural. Do you have anyone to look after you in the days after your chemo? and are you accepting all the help offered. Its very important that you do. I took me 9 days to feel near enough normal after my session, and that was just the first one, and what you are feeling isnt unusual. I don't really have any advice on combating fatigue, apart from listen to your body and rest when you need to,  delegate jobs, chores errands etc whenever possible...can the house sale be put on hold untill your treatment is over?. I'm sorry I don't have any practical advice to give you, I just wanted to reply to say please  don't give up, you're half way through and doing brilliantly in your circumstances.  When I lay awake at night unable to sleep (everything seems worse at night doesn't it) I listen to a meditation cd that I was given. I didn think it would work but it helps soothe the mind... maybe that could help you too. xx",

      "Content": "Hi rosalyn, have you had your October scan ? It doesn't seem right for them  just leave it.  it's normal and necessary to have a scan every 12 weeks, but because my result had dropped a lot they put me on 6 week scans . It seems I am lucky to have a great team who listen to my concerns as they have brought  the scan forward as I was worried . I would suggest going back to whoever is looking after your chemo regime ( mine is nurse led ) and speak to them until you are happy and confident with what you're hearing and the treatment you're getting.  I hope you get this sorted xx amanda I've been told to watch out for the same symptoms too, it's funny but of all the news I've receive dsince diagnosis this arems to have shaken me the most. I definitely don't fancy being on medication for life like the other lady's mother , poor woman xxx let me know how you get on with it all, and thank you for your replies  xx",

      "Content": "Good morning everyone. I have finished my 3 cycles of FEC , had my first herceptin yesterday and start on my Taxatere today. Yesterday I was told that my echo results had dropped by 11% since the beginning of chemo, and it is now at 52%. At my first scan the sonographer was brilliant and explained everything to me. He also said that if the reading went down to 49% or below the effects on the heart would become irreversible. As a result I am on 6 weekly scans instead of 12. Has anybody else had this problem? I feel scans every 6 weeks is too long a gap considering how much the reading has decreased before I even began herceptin. I obviously need to speak to my oncologist again but I would l love to hear from anyone with knowledge or experience in this . Many thanks and I hope you all enjoy the day as best you can xxx",

I spoke to my Lead Nurse today and she has brought my next scan forward as I was so concerned, but she did fully explain to me the whole procedures and ways they will monitor the situatuion, so I am a lot happier now. Thank you for your reply and I hope your mother isn't suffering too much as a result. All the best to you both Jane x",

      "Content": "Just wanted to say on a practical note that I was self employed, working in childcare, and had to give it all up after my surgery back in July.  I am a single parent with 2 children and I am now solely surviving on state benefits. It isn't easy for sure. But there is help out there. I spoke to the financial advisor at my Maggies Centre who helped me through the benefits process. Macmillan also offer this service and can provide grants for certain circumstances. Don't be afraid to ask. I think its terrible that people going through this have money worries to add to everything else, it doesn't help eh... Finished my 3rd FEC yesterday and start Tax in 3 weeks.  Not looking forward to it at all, but hey ho.... Sending everyone love and hugs xx",
