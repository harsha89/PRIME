      "Content": "Thank you R. That's reassuring and helpful. I finished chemo in may this year and my hair is soft, fuzzy and stood up on top at present and a little longer round the sides and back. We go on the only holiday that we did not cancel in October and I am hoping my hair will be long enough to go without my wig albeit with a crew cut! I really did not want to have it shaved. Now I shall leave it to find its own way and appreciate it at each stage!",

Mine is a fuzz at present but someone told me that the recommendation is to have it the first hair shaved off again to allow better growth? I'm reluctant to lose anymore hai, but if that's what it takes....??",
