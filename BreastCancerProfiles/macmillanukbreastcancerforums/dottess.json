      "Content": "I'm glad you've had good care because I don't think it is the norm.  I have had two operations to get rid of breast cancer and the consultant was wonderful.  But I have to say that the nurses have been useless and irritated when I enquired yesterday about the lack of an appointment from oncology.  My consultant on all of my meetings with him has said that I will need hormone pills every day for 10 days to stop the cancer growing again and maybe radiotherapy.  I was told that all this would be arranged 6 weeks after my surgery.  I had the first op. on 16 January.  The nurses in the ward actually bordered on being cruel.  I had the second op on 9 February and on 21 February had my final consultation where I was told that I would be seen my the oncologist within 2 weeks.  This has not happened and I do get the impression from the nurses and the oncologist's secretary whom I rang that us cancer survivors or \"ladies\" as they call us - are a bit of a nuisance.",

      "Content": "My GP wasn't a good source of help, support and good guidance.  He merely wrote a prescription for calcium because I told him that the pharmacist recommended it. I have an appointment to see the oncologist on 10 April which is 12 weeks to the day from the date I had my surgery.  I have asked if I could have some sort of guideline on how long after that I would start the course of radiotherapy if I had to but am met with silence.  It would appear that the secretary makes appointments and that's it and the team of Breast Care Nurses attending meetings but do and say nothing.  What a waste of NHS money.",

      "Content": "I actually received your reply when I was sitting in my GP's surgery today.  When I returned home I read your biography.  My annoyance is that I still have not seen the oncologist to know what treatment I need.  You mentioned radiotherapy;  that the onus was on you to choose and you felt and have virtually been told, that you made the wrong choice.  It would seem that the cancer has started again quite quickly.  I am sorry this has happened for you and have to disagree with you about after-care treatment.  It is not good enough.  I won't go into the further unpleasantness I've had with the breast care nurses but I now have a prescription for the hormone therapy just shoved into an envelope to me with no accompanying explanation.  Hence the visit to my GP to discuss how to take them (he's given me a prescription for calcium as this is recommended alongside) and whether or not, if I do need radiotherapy, will I negate my treatment by taking the hormones.  You used exactly the same terminology as my GP \"belt and braces\".  Proper care and communication are lacking.  I know about PALS but I am not of the mind to keep writing and complaining.  I told the nurses how the ward nurses behaved on the day of my first operation;  I expect them to do something about it but I know they won't because of the hierarchy.",
