I went back to work two weeks after my rads finished (January 2016) and haven't had any sick days off work since. It was hard to start off with though as it wasn't until I was back in the work environment that I realised that \"chemo brain\" was still with me! Nearly two years on I have a normal head of hair (hoorah) and I have got back to below my pre-cancer weight.  If you have the determination you will be fine, but just remember that; it is OK to have bad days; and to be kind to yourself!

I thought that I wasn't really bothered about it but now enough time has passed since the original diagnosis, perhaps I would like to be 'normal' again. I've looked at the booklet and it mentions that more than one operation may be required to get the new one the same as the old one, so will it be a better result and less hassle as they will both be new? I had chemo and rads in 2015 so think it will be some type of flap recon. Any comments greatly appreciated! Love to all.",

One minute you're a normal person then all this hits you. But it  is doable - sure, some of it is unpleasant but the op wasn't particularly painful - more uncofortable. Just take one day at a time and be kind to yourself.  You need time to get get used to the diagnosis.  There is loads of helpful info on this site and Cancer Research UK.  Beware of just using Google though as there is a lot of rubbish out there too. I'm sure you'll get a better reply from one of the regulars soon.  Take care.",
