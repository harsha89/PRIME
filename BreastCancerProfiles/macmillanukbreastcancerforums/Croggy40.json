    "Content": "Hi Pmamummy, I've just started EC chemo last week, I've had FEC before, 10 years ago and the taste I got then was very metallic, but this time everything tastes of salt as yourself, i keep a bottle of Listerine in my bag or a small bottle of corsodil but note this can make you teeth get brown spots. Pineapple or melon before food did help a bit and it won't last forever and it does fade away.Â  Hope I have alleviated your fears and anxiety a little bit.",
