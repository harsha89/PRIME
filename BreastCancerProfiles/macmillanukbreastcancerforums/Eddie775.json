      "Content": "I have read all the way through your thread and was wondering how you got on? I have had a lump for the last two years, GP said it was a benign cyst, however my onco team said to get it checked out. Havent done yet. Just got through prostate cancer and been referred to the Genetics Service for testing due to extensive family history of BCa.  Eddie",

      "Content": "Thanks George & Jackie I had to complete all the family history data for the West Midlands Genetics Service and the other week they wrote to me to get permission to access my medical records from the various hospitals. I completed the BOADICA online system last week, putting the pedigree information into it. The result was a 5.1% probability for BRCA1 and a 65% probability for BRCA 2. My concern is for my daughter and son. Am hoping that I will actually be all clear then my daughter (25) wont have to have all the worries, currently with the data I entered she carries a 33% probability for BRCA2. Need to put this one to bed but it niggles at me as my big sister died at 49 having got BCa at 38. Eddie",

      "Content": "Helen You are right , but it gets embarrassing talking with the GP's.  Its on my list of todo's. But am in the middle of the BRCA business, also have just had my thoracic and lumbar spine MRI'd as I have problems with lower back and pins and needles in feet and legs. Plus this week I go for an EMG and Nerve Conduction Study. All this ontop of PCa and a herniated disc at C6/c7 ( found out as a result of the prostate cancer operation and post operative pain ) - I feel if I say anything more to my GP she may call me a hypochondriac! For years I never went to see a doctor and in the space of 2 years I seem to be like and old car , falling apart.  I did joke with the consultant the other week about falling apart and needing an MoT and repairs.  I see the consultant again in August for the MRI and EMG results, I will ask his advise. He actually may be able to see the lump on the MRI and can given a professional opinion. thanks for your advice Eddie",

      "Content": "Just thought I would update you all on my the situation with the Genetics. Had a letter through end of september confirming that based on the information they have I may have an inherited predisposition to a number of cancers. I am to continue my current surveillance regime and make an appointmtent where they will discuss the options for myself and my family. I was given a deadline of 2 weeks to make the appointment. ( Makes you think its urgent but its not really )  It has taken nearly 4 months to get to this stage. I assume it was because they had to pull medical records from various sources ( I had to give written authority to access my medical records from two hospitals ).  When I phoned for the next appointment they were really apologetic - the earliest they had was the end of Feb 2015. This is at my local hospital, not at the centre in Birmingham.  I could sense that the lady at the end of the phone telling me the date was actually suprised at how long I had to wait.  Still, thats what happens when you live in the sticks and not a big city. I am used to all the waiting. With having cancer and having PSA checks, MRI's and having been through it all you get used to the waiting.  Its the uncertainty of not knowing whether you are a carrier and if you are you may have passed it on to your children, not withstanding the fact that being a carrier increases my own risk for recurrence of existing prostate cancer and risks of other cancer - that they are not screening for.  So, at least as a man I am being checked. I will update you all next year after the appointment. Eddie PS ( Still got that lump ! )",
