      "Content": "Hi Jackie - sounds like they are being very thorough which is great. I had MRIs also - more detailed than mammograms and ultrasounds. I know the waiting is tough, but at least you will know more on tues and I found it all more manageable once I knew the plan. Chin up. You can do this. xxx",

      "Content": "Hi there. My diagnosis 7 weeks ago was very similar and I feel your pain. I have found the waiting the worst part of all and at times felt completely unable to cope, but the mist is beginning to clear and it all feels more manageable now that there are a few less unknowns and I have become stronger. The things that have worked for me are keeping myself distracted with family/friends/work, being a little selfish for a change and doing what I feel is best for me, going for a long walk every day if poss, and meditation on the free Headspace app every morning. A few weeks after diagnosis I had some counselling which was wonderful - I wish I had had it closer to my diagnosis. There is so much help out there - you just have to ask.  Stay strong and take it one day at a time. ❤️",

      "Content": "Pottery, tea&cake and dog walking sounds wonderful and hopefully a great distraction .  I live in West London and organised free counselling directly through the The Haven in Fulham who were just amazing in every possible way and just what I needed. Wherever you live, there is quite possibly something similar not too far away or maybe somewhere like the Haven could chat to you by phone. I just wish I had done it straight after diagnosis and not after a few weeks of feeling so desperate. I have no medical training (just a 7 week crash course!), but it sounds like your diagnosis is the lower end of bad news, as mine seems to be. Let\u2019s hope so! Enjoy the pottery. ❤️",

      "Content": "For me, work has been the best escape from the stress of cancer. I am self employed so I have cut back my workload to reduce any stress and to allow time for appointments and more time with family/friends, and took a week off when I had my lumpectomy two weeks ago. I feel so much calmer when I am at work - I love what I do and have no time to think about the cancer while I am working so it feels good. I guess you need to try different approaches and figure out what works for you. Just take it one day at a time. You\u2019re stronger than you think. ❤️",

My diagnosis is similar (but lobular, not ductal) and I\u2019m a few weeks further along and the mental challenge of it all is getting more manageable. I really felt like I was going completely mad a few weeks ago, but the amazing ladies on this forum are right about it getting a little easier once you get started with a plan.  It could be worse, and you can do this!! ❤️",
