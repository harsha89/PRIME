      "Content": "Hi everybody I'm new to this and just wanting some advice. I have a lump under my arm which feels quite fatty and hard in the middle. The doctor referred me to the breast clinic where I was seen by the breast surgeon. After a thorough examination and been able to see the swelling without touching it he said it was a lymph node so sent me for mammogram and ultrasound. I should be feeling ecstatic as radiologist immediately confirmed it was normal breast tissue which had spread into the tail?  Went back to get report from surgeon who said what the radiologist had said but then said I want to see you in 5 weeks time and if swelling hasn't gone down I want to do a biopsy.  I asked why and he said just to be sure. I asked about why all of a sudden 5 weeks ago I got this swelling and he said he didn't know. My dad has had a double mastectomy for breast cancer so you can imagine why I feel so restless. Anybody else had this or any advice.  Thank you loulou ",
