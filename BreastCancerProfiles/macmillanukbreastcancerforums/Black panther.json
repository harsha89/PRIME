However, I found eating a ginger biscuit just before a meal got rid of 'the taste' albeit temporarily but it lasted long enough for me to have a meal that tasted like it should do.  Mints or chewing gum were also suggested but I didn't try that.  One of my chemo buddies found Ginger beer helped too with having something to drink, I don't like Ginger beer so I just stuck to water and an occasional cup of tea or coffee with my Ginger biscuits. Hope this helps, stay strong sweetheart your taste will return to normal once your chemo is finished.",

      "Content": "Hi Rosalyn Thanks for your reassuring words, my husband is always telling me not to be too hard on myself but hey ho thats me lol! When I was on the FEC treatment my symptoms were extreme tiredness, foggy Chemo brain and I found when I got up each morning I felt a bit dizzy, however, I was lucky I didn't get any nausea or sickness, my Chemo treatment was every 3rd Tuesday, we managed to work out when I started to hit nadir of Chemo - this would start on the Friday night/Saturday morning.  When I changed over to the Docetaxel my main symptoms stayed the same, however as soon as I hit nadir I started to feel unwell all taste just went - I've never had a roast dinner where most of it tasted like flour, anyway I couldn't stomach anymore of that, my husband asked me if I was OK all I could manage was a \"no I don't feel very well but couldn't really explain why, that was until I started shaking all over I felt cold yet my forehead was very warm, my husband made me a drink to warm me up then I had a cold drink by now it was like 30mins or so after I'd started to feel unwell.  We took my temperature it had gone up to 38 degrees centigrade, my husband contacted the Oncology department where I was being treated they got hold of my Oncologist - by now my temp had gone up to 38.2, the Onc unit called back and told my husband to bring me in with an overnight bag.  Got to the hospital it was a dreadful night pouring down with rain, my husband kept me talking to make sure I remained conscious, anyway my husband dropped me off near to the main entrance and like an idiot I ran into the hospital - not a good move I thought I was going to faint, we met with a porter and he took us up to the ward where the first thing they did was put an antibiotic IV drip in my arm then took a series of blood tests - they were testing for Neutropenic Sepsis. I couldn't sleep I felt terrible I actually thought I was going to die I felt that bad. Next day I was told I hadn't got Neutropenic Sepsis and they couldn't find any reason why I felt ill.  I stayed in hospital until the Wednesday.   I don't want to scare you but I reacted after each Docetaxel on hitting nadir, after the second I found I had an allergy to the antibiotics I was given, after the third and final dose we managed to keep me out of hospital - the same thing happened only I'd been given some amoxicillin so as soon as I started to feel unwell and my temp went up  to 38.4 I started the antibiotics we maintained contact throughout the Friday and Saturday with the Onc unit but managed to sort it out ourselves.  Sorry this is such a long post, hope you find the docetaxel easier than the FEC, let me know how you get on after your first docetaxel. Big hugs I'll be thinking of you next week.",

My hospital administered treatment ended on January 27th 2014 - then having held it together with the help of my husband, my mother in law and other friends and family for 8 months I fell apart, I was told by one of the Radiographers that this is normal.   I shan't ever forget the weeks before my 46th birthday in 2013, or the ones that followed - the chemo was horrendous and I ended up in hospital after the first Docetaxel, Pre cancer I had already been confirmed as pre-menopausal, however, now I'm finding that the slightest thing sends me into floods of tears, I'm having hot flushes and night sweats, we now believe that these symptoms have been exacerbated by or even caused by the Tamoxifen.  Has anyone else experienced these issues, any advice would be gratefully appreciated.",

The Onc nurse treating me said \"if I get through the first 5 minutes with the cap on then I'd be OK to continue with it\".   It was put on my head my husband took one look at me grinned and asked me if I was ready for the 3.30 at Cheltenham - ever the comedian however by that point I started to get a headache - husband nearly wore the cold cap. Although keeping a sense of humour throughout your journey does help. My experience of the cold cap caused a great deal of amusement to my husband and that was that.  My hair started to fall out just before my second FEC so didn't bother with the cap and just let nature take its course.   Five months on I now have a full head of hair again, its been trimmed 3 times now and my hairdresser is able to style it and make it appear longer than it actually is, I've also had it coloured as it was growing back 50 shades of grey.

      "Content": "Dear Yvonne On a positive your daughter is back at work through my experiences this is something for her to focus on, naturally she will be worried about you and what you're going through. What antidepressants is she on?  I ask as some years ago I was prescribed Amitrypitiline gradually going up to 75mg per day, I found these drugs actually made me depressed, I spoke to my then GP who took no real notice so I weaned myself off of them.  If she is on these I would suggest she goes back to her GP with her wife too and discuss other antidepressants that may help her. I'm guessing here that you, your daughter and her wife have talked about your BC if not it maybe worth trying.  If any of the above don't help it may be helpful to your daughter to seek some form of counselling, I had counselling through my breast cancer journey, and of course she can always talk to someone at Macmillan.  Just a few thoughts purely based on my own experience and cancer journey, I also find music helped me I have an eclectic taste in music but I created a music folder on my computer on bad days even now I play the contents of that folder and sit and cry, for me generally I will feel better after as the crying releases my emotions. I hope some of these help, I'm not a medic but learnt a lot of lessons from the \"school of hard knocks\", I've worked as a carer and am a good listener feel free to share this with your daughter and if it helps I'm happy to have contact with both yourself and your daughter via private messaging on this site.

I'm 46 and have been pre-menopausal for several years (this has been confirmed by the LH/FSH blood test) so my cycle has been all over the place, right now I've missed 7 consecutive periods (+ the missed one in Sept) and am now within the restart zone but for me so far no sign apart from a couple of shows back at the beginning of the year. I checked with my Breast consultant as I'm getting menopausal symptoms to find out if Tamoxifen forces you into an early menopause (my Chemo buddy had said it does) however my consultant said it doesn't. He didn't mention if it stopped them, however,  looking through the leaflet with the Tamoxifen it would seem it can stop them but I will stress here this has not been confirmed to me by either of my consultants.  I'll update you if my periods start or not.

      "Content": "Hi Julie I had the FEC-T chemotherapy my last Docetaxel was 3rd December.  In my case my toe nails took the brunt of the chemo they were discoloured as kind of brown/yellow colour they are now virtually back to normal.  I had long finger nails so I cut them and kept them really short and used gloves to clean etc., after the second Docetaxel my fingernails did have ridges so I got some O.P.I Nail Envy this is a clear nail strengthener so keeping the nails short and using the nail envy I grew my nails out so the white of the nail was just about 2mm above my fingers then remove the nail envy, cut the nails down again and reapply the nail envy - I am a trained manicurist.  By repeating these steps and each time the nails were cut another ridge disappeared, unfortunately toenails take longer to grow but I did the same with them but don't apply the nail envy, instead I put a prescription moisturiser (Hydromol ointment) on them every night be sure to put plenty on each nail and of course any residual cream can be rubbed into your hands and around the cuticles.  As already mentioned paint your finger nails a dark colour to disguise the discolouration however, you should also every few days or so remove all nail varnish and let the nails breathe. The link attached gives you some suggestions as to how to combat the sickness/nausea caused by the chemo - I figured attaching the link would be better for you as to type up all the information and hints and tips to combat the sickness well you'd be up all night reading my post. http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/cancer-help/about-cancer/treatment/cancer-drugs/side-effects/sickness-and-cancer-drugs I hope you find the hints and tips sent to you so far helpful.  Good luck on your journey on this site you certainly will get all the support and friendship to help you.
