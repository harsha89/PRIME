    "Content": "Hi Can I offer my advise as a hairdresser? If you are trying to avoid toxins having contact with your scalp then maybe have some woven high lights (foils)? This way you can get the lighter colour you want without ANY product being applied to your scalp and you can have more than one colour put in. Unfortunately there doesnt seem to be great deal of lightening products out there without using peroxide and the usual stuff. You will still have bits of grey showing as the whole head wouldn't be covered but it's worth considering.
