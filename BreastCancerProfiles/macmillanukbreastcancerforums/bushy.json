      "Content": "Hi thank you for your replies :-) i felt really down for the rest of the day yesterday, but feel better about things today. I told my husband that i had had a cry, and nearly started again when i was telling him. He was really good, it's amazing how a hug can put things right! Both sons (aged 22 and 18) know i have a lump that has been tested. The 22 year old has been doing little jobs round the house like emptying bins and offering to make me cups of tea and coffee (amazing what they can do when they put their minds to it). I don't know why i am feeling better about things today because i had more news on the appointment dates/times. The consultants secretary phoned my today to tell me my MRI scan is on Wednesday 25th Feb, but don't know when my results appointment is, because he needs to have a multi disciplinary meeting about me on the Friday 27th. So i won't see him for the results until the week beginning 2nd March :-( 3 weeks waiting from having my mammogram and biopsy to getting the results! I was really hoping i would be able to get the results next week as my husband is off work. I am thinking of phoning the breast care clinic tomorrow and asking, no begging!, if they can tell me over the phone. The waiting is bloody torture!!! As you know! It's a week since my biopsy and mammogram and ultrasound. It's very frustrating thinking that someone in a laboratory knows i have cancer, and i don't. Do you think there is any possibility they will tell me over the phone? Then when i start thinking about it, why would the consultant need to have a meeting about me if it's not cancerous?? I NEED TO STOP THINKING!!! haha xxxx",

She said that's why i'm having the MRI, then the MDT meeting and i get an appointment after that for the results. I said i knew that, but was just phoning in the hope that my biopsy results were back and she could put me out of my misery. If they can't tell from a mammogram or ultrasound, why do they use them? Oh god this is so frustrating! Oh well, looks like i won't be finding anything out until March!!",

But instead of seeing him some time next week for the results of my mammogram, ultrasound and biopsy, he wants to see me on Thursday. He is having the MDT meeting about me on Friday,  but has decided to not make me wait for the results until after. I don't know if that's a good thing or not. But at least I should know one way or the other hopefully. His secretary said that the consultant will tell me what he can, but may not be everything because he won't know everything until he has had the multi disciplinary meeting. But this torturous wait is almost at an end!!!!",

I went to see my mum and dad to tell them last night and i've managed to tell the 17 year old this afternoon. He took it really well, especially as a lad he played football with has cancer and doesn't have long left :-( I went to see my sister-in-law today (my mum had already told her though). Still feels very surreal when talking about chemo! It's like looking in on someone else saying it. I phoned work today, and i'm doing the shift i'm rota'd to do 7.30am - 8.30pm so will see how that goes. Just my 22 year old to tell when he's home from work. How are you finding people when you tell them?",

Although i would swap them for the world. I haven't heard anything yet about start dates. My BC nurse is phoning me on Tuesday morning so i can ask her things i have thought of, so she might have some news for me i suppose. I think the next appointment i will have is to see the oncologist? From reading about chemo on  here, i think i will have some tests to make sure i am well enough for the chemo? I did my first shift at work yesterday since being diagnosed. It was a long day. I thought i was being my normal self, but when i told one of the staff nurses she said she thought i had been very quiet and looked fed up. So i hadn't done such a good job of hiding the fact i was upset. One of the other nurses that hasn't spoken to me that much took me by surprise and gave me a hug! Although i almost wish she hadn't because it made me feel a bit emotional. A few colleagues were surprised i had gone to work, and kept asking me why i was there. But i felt ok, and i just said i need to think about the money side of things and i need to save my sick pay for when i have no choice to be off. It's not nice, but the financial things have to be thought about.",

      "Content": "Hi all this is my first post, I haven't been told 100% that I have breast cancer, i'm waiting for the results.  I had my first breast clinic appointment on Wednesdsay 11th January. I had mammogram, ultrasound and biopsy done. I have a large lump (feels about the size of a tennis ball) which they said it looks very suspicious. They referred me to have an MRI because they couldn't measure the size of it. I was told they would see me very quickly for the MRI, they checked my mobile number was correct so they could phone me with an appointment.  Today i rang the clinic to chase the MRI appointment so they put me through to that department. They gave me an appointment of 25th Feb for the MRI which is the day before my clinic appointment. I also had it in my head (wrongly) that my next clinic appointment was 23rd.  So i have got myself all worked up about them not having time to look at the pictures and results before i go to see the consultant. The consultants secretary is  going to phone me tomorrow with appointment days and times.  I have been thinking that my results day is Monday 23rd and i will know either way, so i am now in bits and crying my eyes out that i wont get them until 26th. I know it's only a couple of days later than i thought they were, but it has really upset me.  I haven't cried at all over the last 2 weeks since i saw my Dr and been to the clinic, it seems so stupid to cry over something as  trivial as an extra 3 days!! Then when i was having a cry my son came home so have tried to hide the fact i was upset. My husband is due home in a few minutes as well, so i'm hoping my eyes will be back to normal colour so he doesn't notice.  Anyway, sorry my first post is a long moan (i'm not usually like this), but i think i'll feel better now i have got that off my chest :-) xx",

So i don't know yet if i am on the same journey as you. Fingers crossed it's a benign lump, but i am expecting the worst to be honest.  I was told at the first clinic appointment, when they did the ultra sound it showed a node in my armpit was swollen and looked suspicious. I will be so shocked if they say it isn't cancer. I hardly slept last night and don't suppose i will tonight either. Oh well, I have a pile of ironing i can do without waking everyone else, and i'm planning on doing some baking in the morning to try and occupy myself. I haven't told my sons that i get my results tomorrow, and i haven't told my parents. I feel really guilty keeping it to myself, as i am very close to my mum and tell her everything. But if it's bad news i feel i might want to get my head round it myself before i have to tell them. Only my husband knows and he is going with me.

I have been told i have Grade 3 because the cancer is about 6cm and the biopsy showed my lymph node had cancerous cells in it. I kept it together in the consulting room, nodding and saying yes and no in the right places , as though i was taking everything in. But as soon as the nurse opened the door i was in tears. She took me and my husband to a small room with sofas and let us have 10 minutes. She then made us a cuppa while she went through everything again, gave me some leaflets and asked if we had any questions. I felt like i had a million questions to ask but couldn't think of anything. She has made a phone appointment for me on Tuesday morning where she rings me at home so i can ask her anything i have thought of. So i need to write a list of things to ask her as they pop into my head before i forget them again lol I've already forgot what type of breast cancer it is, she said something about it starting in the milk duct. My treatment is to start with chemotherapy first and see if the tumor shrinks and then surgery after. I'm waiting for an appointment to see the oncologist now to discuss the chemo.  I'm now psyching myself up to tell the boys and my parents.  I'm feeling upset and guilty about upsetting them!!

The day after the op I stayed in bed, then the next day I sat in the chair, and had to walk to the loo. The next day I was walking to the loo at the opposite end of the ward and trying to walk as tall and straight as I could. I had no pain in the boob area, any pain was in the tummy area, and even that was manageable with paracetamol, ibuprofen and codeine. It wasn't long before I was back to normal. I have been back to the gym for a few weeks, done a bit of running and doing all the housework.  I'm really pleased with the result already and looking forward to having my left reduced and lifted to match. I have a very long scar on tummy area, but it's below my pant line and it will fade. On the plus side my stomach is the flattest it's been for a while.
