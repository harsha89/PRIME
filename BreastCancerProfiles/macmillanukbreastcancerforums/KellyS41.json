      "Content": "Hi Libby Im so glad that you have been given something to help with your pain, you shouldn't need to suffer.  I hope that the Docetaxol works for you after my 3 cycles of it my tumour had shrunk to less than half the size it was to start,  After all your chemo the operation will be a walk in the park. Take care Kelly x",

      "Content": "Hello Libby I am sorry to read all the problems you are having, I know exactly what you are going through I had 3 cycles of Docetaxol and 3 cycles of FEC and I had many of the pains you have got and if anyone had told me I would suffer like that I would have thought twice about it I should have realised what it was going to be like when my BCN said they were going to hit it hard with a sledge hammer!!!!! I suffered alot of joint pain when I first started and was told to take piriton and paracetamol, and dont remind me of the yukky mouth I still have it a bit after 2 months but was given a mouthwash from the hospital called Difflam was very strong but was very good. With the fatigue all I can say is rest as much as you can and if you have someone who can can help let them. All I can say is it is a long hard journey and you will have lots of ups and downs but even though it doesnt feel like it now its going to make you better. I hope you get some answers next time your at the hospital.   Kelly x",
