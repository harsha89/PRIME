    "Content": "I am glad I've found this thread today. I found a lump in my right breast last Thursday night. I woke up this morning with real tenderness in between my breast and collarbone. I am going to the doctors tomorrow, but wondered if anyone else had experienced this? I'm getting married Saturday & going on honeymoon Monday, so could do without the worry. But would rather be safe than sorry. PetticoatTwirler - I'm an over sharer too! This puts my mind at rest as this is probably the bit I am more worried about",
