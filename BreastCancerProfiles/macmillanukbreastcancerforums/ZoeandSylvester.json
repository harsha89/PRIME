    "Content": "I read a while back the problem with being on the pill and taking on that silly on-off-on-off basis can be part of the problem because your hormone levels are forced to fluctuate, yet still the manufacturers suggest from the packaging that you have to take it for 21 days then take a break for 7. Why? All you get is a totally false and unnecessary withdrawal bleed. We need to put a stop to this once and for all. If the drug suits you, you should be able to take it continuously.",
