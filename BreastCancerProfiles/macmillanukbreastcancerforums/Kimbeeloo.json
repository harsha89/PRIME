I'm really not very computer savvy, honestly trying to navigate through is almost as frustrating as having breast cancer!    I feel like I'm not at all confident in the Her2+ test result. It seems you can be +, then negative and vice versa. That troubles me.. I have an appointment Monday and have quite a list of questions. Can I request another test.. can I request the oncoyte DX to support the recommendation for chemo. I have found some ladies who were able to just have Herceptin some who were not given the option. I'm pretty sure it will depend on where we live. I am in Northern Ontario Canada. I would like to know the percentages of chance if reoccurring with and without. I believe there are many things I can do to prevent further reoccurrence.. such as completely revamping my diet.. quitting the red wine.. darn it!! So I have my notes, and we shall see next week hiw it all pans out! Again thank you all! And take good care!!  I will post next week after my appointments!",
