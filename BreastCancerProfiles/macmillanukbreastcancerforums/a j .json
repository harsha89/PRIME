    "Content": "Hi Flower24. I have had recent lumpectomy and mine too is on the underside. My surgeon mentioned offering me lipofil. This is a new treatment where they harvest fat from another part of your body such as stomach (a bit like liposuction) this fat is then injected into your breast to fill in the lost tissue. I think this is a new procedure and i was lucky enough that my clinic offers it. I wonder if you could be referred if yours doesn't? Unfortunately I'm no longer having this as I have just been told I need mx. Good luck x",
