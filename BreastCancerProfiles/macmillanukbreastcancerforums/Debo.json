As he left he said I would move on to the oncology department and wouldn't be back at his clinic for a year. Today I got back from first day back at work to two letters one with appointment for oncology and the other back at surgical clinic. Is it normal to hope its for him to say it's all a massive mistake ? Is it possible they have made a mistake Debs xx",

I was simply told that a team of doctors and nurses advised chemo + radiotherapy + tablets for 10. Years. Not sure what I would do if given a choice . Hope you are able to make the right choice for you . Very best wishes Debbie xxxx",
