      "Content": "Hi there Cassa, I am 71 and I had a single mastectomy last December. As one of the sentinel nodes had cancer I then had to have all  the lymph glands under my arm removed. The results were sent for Oncotype testing and after a long wait came back saying that I did not need chemo, thank goodness. I haven't had radiotherapy either so feel very lucky. My underarm is still quite numb. I am taking Letrozole and a bone scan has shown that I have osteopenia, which can develop into osteoporosis. So I now take Calcium tablets with Alendronic acid. There are side effects but I think I have got off lightly. Best wishes.",

      "Content": "Hi there Kazwilko. I had a mastectomy in December followed 4 weeks later by removal of all lymph nodes. The lymph nodes were clear thankfully but I was offered the Oncotype test. It is used to predict the possibility of the cancer returning. It is specific to that one particular cancer and to see if chemotherapy would be of any benefit. The results are supposed to be back in 2 weeks. Mine took almost 4 weeks. The waiting was horrible. I was very lucky because my result showed only a 2% chance of recurrence. I am 71 years old. I live in Lancashire. I believe the test costs about £2500. Sorry for the late reply. We went on holiday to celebrate the end of treatment I hope that your treatment goes well, best wishes.

      "Content": "After I had all the lymph nodes removed from under my arm I could not get a good night's sleep. I sleep on the affected side and during the time I had my drain in and for a few days afterwards I could not lie on that side. Then a friend brought me a shaped cushion. It was made by a local lady who has just started up a small business. If anyone is interested in getting one her business is called \" pendlesideinteriorsandoccasions\" It was great to get some sleep.",
