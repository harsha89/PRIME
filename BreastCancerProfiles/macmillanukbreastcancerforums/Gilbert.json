      "Content": "As you can see from the posts everyone is different and you will know when you are ready to go back to work, but i would like to meet your boss if she thinks cosmetic surgery has anything to do with a cancer diagnosis. Unless she thinks you decided to have cancer! My boss has been brilliant and after 18 months is still holding my job for me if i become well enough to return. Radio therapy wore me out traveling to the hospital 5 days a week for 5 weeks but i was lucky with the chemo the antisickness meds kept me feeling ok. The whole experience is exhausting and fatigue is common. Take the time you need, as others have posted cancer is covered by the disability employment act and any boss would be on dodgy ground if they didn't take note of the act.  ",
