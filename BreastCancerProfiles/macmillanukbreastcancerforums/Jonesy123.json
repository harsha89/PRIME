      "Content": "I have join this group hoping to find some sort of reassurance? Don't know if that is really the right word. I took my mum who is 69, to the GP on Monday after she had found a lump in her Breast which had also given off some discharge. After examination he diagnosed cancer, and told her then he would refer her to a specialist for further tests. So we we are now left waiting for an appointment to see what we are dealing with. My main question in all this is can a Doctor diagnos the lump to be cancer just for examination? Be grateful to anyone who may be able to help with this , thanks.",

      "Content": "Thanks Dorothee for that reply. I also thought the same, that it was quiet a call for the doctor to come straight out with it. I thought that further tests would be done before he would be so sure as to state that it was cancer. I will definitely be going with her though as I know how tough it's going to be for her. Thanks again, nice to know this service is avaliable from Macmillan. Talking definitely helps.",

I also hope that the tests prove otherwise, but so glad I found this group to help whatever the tests turn out to be. Thanks again, all the best to you xx",
