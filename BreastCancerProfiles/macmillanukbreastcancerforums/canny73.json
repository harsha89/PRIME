      "Content": "Hi Amanda . I have gone throug a lot of procedures . I have had a masectomy with temporary reconstruction . I then had a diep flap which was an 11 hour op  - where a large area is cut from my stomach and a new breast is made from that . Unfortunately I had to go back into surgery the next day as a blood vessel had kinked . I ended up with sepsis . I did lose a lot of my reconstruction due to all these complications . I have had 2 lipofills so far which haven\u2019t made that big of a difference to be honest . I just feel so deflated- emotionally and physically . my surgeon  has talked about possibly having the LD flap in the future - where they use the back muscle . I was very anti this as I had been told it feels very odd when you stretch etc . I see that you have a surgeon in Portugal you you were very happy with . Would you mind me asking who he is , his contact details and an approximate cost of the procedure . I just want to get my life back on track and put this all behind me . It\u2019s been ongoing since June 2015  Thank you Michelle xxx",

      "Content": "Thank you so much for getting back to me . It is something I will definitely look into . I am having my third lipofill tomorrow . I have asked the surgeon to get as much fat as he possibly can . Last time he only got 150ml . I am hoping for at least 500 mls this time . He is going to cut out the necrotic fat too as it is not getting any smaller and does cover a large area . I will keep you posted . Thank you so much again xx",
