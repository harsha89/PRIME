      "Content": "Hi All I have had 3 x FEC and on Wednesday had my first of 3 Docetaxel.  I felt ok until Friday night albeit I was more tired than usual, but ever since I feel as though I have been hit by a car.  I could not get out of bed at all yesterday and today have managed to make it to the sofa where I have slept on and off all day.  My mouth is very sore and the taste is far worse than it ever was on FEC and I have had severe constipation and achy joints.  I have tried throughout all of this to be upbeat, but this has taken it out of me.  I'm already starting to panic about the next one.  Please tell me it gets better??",

      "Content": "Thank you all so much for your advice, I have contacted my hospital and arranged to go and see someone later today.  She is going to arrange a mouthwash and something for the rash on my hands which is really starting to burn.  On the plus side, I'm a lot less achy today. Thanks again xx",

      "Content": "Thank you Mudge, I think I really just needed to hear that these symptoms are not going to stay with me the whole time. I wasn't given a mouthwash in fact, I have never been given anything to combat any of the symptoms I've experienced so far (apart from the sickness with the FEC) My regular BCN is on holiday next week, but I think I will phone the one who covers. I have been drinking as much as I can physically stomach, so hopefully that'll flush it out! Thank you x",
