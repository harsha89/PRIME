      "Content": "It's definitely a strange journey. I've just been for wounds checking. All looks fine. I think I'll be more relaxed once I get the results on Thursday, at the moment everything feels up in the air , once I know what I'm facing Re treatment I'll have something to focus on that gets me nearer to the end of this part of my life. I feel better now the sticky patches have gone.  Exercise wise I still can't get my arm completely flat against the wall but it's getting there, slowly but surely. Thank you for all your replies, it's good to know this is how it feels for most xxxxxx",

      "Content": "Day 4,  I've stopped the codeine hospital gave me as I wear a morphine patch anyway and that's doing the job well on its own. I had awful acid reflux for 3 nights, last night was the first restful nights sleep I've had. I'm just pottering around the house, hubby has taken over cooking/cleaning and laundry. I feel like a spare part.  My underarm and upper chest are still numb, but I'm getting the odd twinge there so I think it's 'defrosting' slowly lol. I keep looking at my flat part, it still doesn't feel real, I don't know what I'm expecting to be honest with you, it all happened so quickly, I guess I need to catch up with what is actually going on.  The only annoying thing is the light headedness if I stand up/walk around for longer than 10 minutes. Strange sensation, I'm 44............ feeling much older. Hope everyone else is doing well. Lisa",
