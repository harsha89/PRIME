      "Content": "Hi, I\u2019m 5 weeks since my final chemo and used the coldcap throughout. I retained about 50% of my hair. I had complete hair loss on the top of my head, but cover it with headbands. It\u2019s started  to grow back, and is looking thick and healthy. I\u2019m really happy I stuck with the cold cap. My question to anyone who has now finished is did you cut your hair short after the new hair started growing back, or stay with head bands or scarfs until the new hair was a reasonable length. Also was the new hair much thicker than the old hair, which is the case with me.  really would appreciate any advice. Thanks so much and continued good health to us all. Tracy x",
