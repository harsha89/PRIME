I don\u2019t feel any different since being on them !!  I did do the cold cap but I don\u2019t know if I will do it again think I\u2019m going to just wait and see what falls out in the next two weeks then decide . As much as I done it I didn\u2019t like it if anything it was the chin strap that drove me mental for theee hours but the worry I have is if hair does fall out will it be even more uncomfy with less hair so I\u2019m kind of waiting now to see what happens lol xxx",

I\u2019ve booked family days out of the back of this and made all our December plans around this . To many it may be silly but Christmas is my favourite time of year . It took us 5 years to have our baby and our first xmas last year myself and the baby had nurovirus from xmas eve for 5 days so it was a complete write of I just wanted this year to be perfect for us all let alone George !!  Because I have lost so much money since finding the lump on 15th September due to appointments being only on my working days and 3 trips to London for tests I was working a huge amount of extra shifts December including xmas day for a couple of hours to make up what I have lost and basically have a little bit of money in the bank to fall back on as we won\u2019t get no financial help il be lucky if I get pro rata ssp So now they have said all these plans are basically being pushed aside I feel literally anxious as anything and stressed to the actual max !!!!  I\u2019ve got an appointment Thursday at 4 to discuss more then oncology was to see me on Monday with a veiw that chemo will be around the 18th of December week !!!  Tuesday count down for you I feel you :-(((",

      "Content": "Hey Kirsty ,  God I can totally relate to how you feel !!! I found my lump right breast on 15th September then got diagnosed on 18th October . Two days before my 32nd birthday with Triple negative Breast cancer .  After weeks of tests and mris and biopsy\u2019s I got my genetic results last Thursday to also be told I don\u2019t have the gene . Again great news !!!  Like you I was told it would be a mastectomy on my right breast with reconstruction at the same time . I requested a double to be told highly unlikely as no cancer in the left breast but to keep pushing for it when results are in .  But when results did come in it quickly changed to a lumpectomy which for the first time since being diagnosed caused me to breakdown in the appointment because I had got my head round the mastectomy side .  Then the next day they called me again to say even though I had no genetic mutations Guys recommendation is that I\u2019m to have a double mastectomy with reconstruction so now not only am I getting my one done that I wanted I\u2019m actually getting both !!! ( so they say anyway ) so please check what they recommend for you too !!  My MDT are having the meeting today so I\u2019m getting a phone call later this afternoon to be told exactly what\u2019s being decided literally clock watching like anthing today badly - hate all the waiting xxxx",

Then il have a month off followed by double mastectomy with reconstruction at the start of summer .  All in all I\u2019m so happy with the plan and now feeling like I just want to get going but I know the wait will be worth it seeing my boy on Christmas Day etc .  How is everyone ?

Yes it adds time to your infusion but I think it\u2019s worth it as keeping my hair is so important to me . I take pain killers a hour before and that made the second one so much better infact after the first 15 minutes which can be described as brain freeze i actually forgot I had it on for the rest .  The worst is always the first as it\u2019s the unknown but I would say go for it and try !!!
