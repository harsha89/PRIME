    "Content": "Hi All, This forum is so helpful.  I am 36 years old and am having a double mastectomy on Wednesday 9th June 2010 due to the discovery of multiple tumours.  My Mum had breast cancer at 35 - thankfully she survived, but I am finding it increasingly hard to deal with.  Luckily I have the wonderful support of my family, including a fantastic Husband and two children, who are just 9 and 11 years old. ",
