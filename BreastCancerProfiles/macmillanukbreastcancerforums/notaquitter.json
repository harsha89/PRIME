      "Content": "Hi, I've just had my last herceptin injection after  mastectomy and chemo. I have definately put exercise and diet first, post cancer. I have lost 4 stones in weight and regularly exercise. However,  I have been having problems at work, as they are not prepared to make the  reasonable adjustments to ease the pressures on me.(I am a primary school teacher.) So, I have been left stressed and having to take sickness leave. I have decided to change my role and apply for a job as a TA or part time teacher. I am really determined to put my health first and to adapt my lifestyle to that of a simpler model.",
