      "Content": "from what ive read,if u have surgery first it means your lump isnt too big,theyll operate then zap you with chemo to get rid of any small cells left....im the opposite,lumps huge and having to shrink it before surgery....so in a weirdly wonderful way having surgery first is a good thing",

      "Content": "hi,i think  our  first  thoughts are  always with  our  children,mine were,i didnt  have another thought  in  my  head when i  was diagnosed  back in january.my  children are 6  months,9  and  10  years.I  really found  it  hard  for  the first  couple of  weeks,but when  you're  given  your treatment plan and you are  on your  way  it  does  get slightly easier,especially  reading  other  ladies  posts  on  here  help.My  childrens school  have  been  excellent,we  had  a  few  emotional days but  as ive  started chemo(fec)  our  family life  has pretty much continued as it was.I'm  open  and  up  front  with  my   children  as  i  didnt  want  them  listening  to adults  'whispers'  and  feeling  left  out....i think  theyre  coping  well....apologese  for  my spacing  whilst  typing  lol  the  little  loves  have  covered  the  keyboard/keys  in  crisps!!!",
