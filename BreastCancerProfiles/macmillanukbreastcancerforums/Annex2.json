      "Content": "I am surprised because I have a friend who had breast cancer and they tested her lymph nodes while she was under and found there wasn't any cancer so didn't remove these. I was surprised by everyone's answer. Is there anyone out there who has experienced testing while under so the lymph nodes were not removed?",

I have been advised that I have to go back in to hospital to have some lymph nodes removed from under my arm to check if the cancer has spread. Does anyone know if they can do a biopsy while you are under so if there is no cancer found, then they don't have to remove the lymph nodes?",

      "Content": "Jayne, Thank you for the information and the kind words. I was talking with someone earlier today and they mentioned this sentinel node biopsy as well so I will mention this to my consultant. Do you know if when they do this if there are any side effects similar to the ones you get when they just remove multiple lymph nodes (I was told they would take out approximately 10) i.e. I was told to expect numbness etc? Is this considered a better treatment do you know? Warm regards and thanks again Anne",
