      "Content": "Hi Spenfold, thanks for your reply, sorry it has taken me so long to reply, I've just not been in a very good place but am back at work and feeling more positive.  I did loose my hair first time round so am so hoping to keep it this time on a lower dose of Taxol - I know in the grand scheme of things losing hair is a minor thing, but to me it makes a very private fight all of a sudden public.  I will defo. look at getting a wig if I loose too much hair, but as my head is the size of a pin - nickname in the past has been PINHEAD - hope I can get one that fits the size of a 6 year old - which actually coincides with the size of my brain - ha ha .  Good luck and thanks so much xxx",
