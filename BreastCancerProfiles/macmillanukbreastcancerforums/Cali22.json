      "Content": "Thank you so much for the replys.  Im currently taking tamoxifen, but the onco said that they are trialling the injection in place of it (for primary cancers) and so far have found that it can slow down the regrowth/prevent it coming back by upto 30% in comparrison.  I was unsure if I wanted to put myself through more treatment for a small percentage if the side effects where large (im only 35 so the potential heart and bone problems put me off a bit).  More dreaded what ifs I guess.  I do feel slightly better now from your comments, so thank you.  Oh and congratulations on becomming a grandmother how exciting xxx",
