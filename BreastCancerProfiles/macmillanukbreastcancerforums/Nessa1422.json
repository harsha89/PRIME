      "Content": "Hi, yes I'm also Triple Neg and stopped chemo after 4 cycles as the tumour was growing. However, after surgery they were able to tell me that the centre of the tumour was 'dead' basically so there had been a partial response, so please don't feel too down about it.",

      "Content": "Wonder if anyone can suggest any help please. Had a mastectomy with ANC last June, healed well until Radiotherapy messed everything up. I have some swelling so am unable to have the 'chicken fillet' prosthesis at present. On my rare bra wearing occasions, I am wearing the original comfy or a knitted knocker. Once in place they are fine, but as they are so lightweight I find I spend all my time fiddling around with my bra and pulling it down constantly as that side tends to rise up all the time. Has anyone any suggestions as to how I might weigh down my right side at all please? Having one normal breast and the other ending up around my neck is not the best look!!",
