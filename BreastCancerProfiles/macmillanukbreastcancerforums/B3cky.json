    "Content": "I'm on day 16 of first EC chemotherapy cycle. Got to have 3 cycles of EC, followed by weekly patlitaxel and carboplatin before surgery for triple negative breast cancer. So far feel very lucky that I have not had many side effects; felt tired at times, funny taste and some nausea but been able to carry on with life pretty much as normal so far. Hair started falling out a couple of days ago, wig appointment on Tuesday when I will probably get my head shaved. Next chemo appointment on Friday, worrying it might start to affect me more but hoping not. Would be nice to have this thread to ask questions and just offload, it's good to talk to people who get it x",
