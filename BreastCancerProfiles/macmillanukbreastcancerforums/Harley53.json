    "Content": "Hi Moomy, I too have been plagued by UTIs. In my 20s I had them when pregnant or breastfeeding. Had a doctor then who planned to dilate my urethra. I made the appointment but when the doctor saw my face he asked what was wrong. I told him I thought the whole thing was going to be a torture session. He decided not to perform the dilation. They got better in my thirties, but in my 40s I had a total hysterectomy. The UTIs started up again. Some years I had them every single month. My doctor had me use Estrace, which helped immensely. Then a little over a year ago I had a diagnosis of breast cancer and had a double mastectomy. When I saw my cancer doctor I was told I could no longer use the estrogen and would have to take Letrozole for at least 5 years. (Last appointment my oncologist\u2019s PA said the current recommendation is 10 years!) I\u2019ve had constant UTIs since. I\u2019ve been on antibiotics for many months, nonstop. The antibiotic are causing further problems with diarrhea, bloating and constant burping. I\u2019m also seeing a gastroenterologist and have had issues with IBS. I\u2019ve started taking probiotics trying to counter the effects of the antibiotics. I have started on myrbetriq because I\u2019m having to run to the bathroom constantly as well. I\u2019ve had enough. My urologist did tell me the Letrozole is likely a factor. I know for a fact every time my hormones are out of whack I\u2019m prone to UTIs. A month ago I quit the Letrozole. I don\u2019t go back till June 22. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019ll be mad that I quit without discussing it with him. Other than that I\u2019ve had joint pain, especially in my hips. It\u2019s starting to improve. I have restless legs, anemia, overwhelming anxiety and osteopenia.  Harley  Here\u2019s to a happy and healthier tomorrow!",
