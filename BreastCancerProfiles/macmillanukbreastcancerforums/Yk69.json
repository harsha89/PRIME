    "Content": "Hi Pearldrops, I\u2019ve been on zoladex for 7 weeks now and just last week came out in these red itchy spots on my arms, legs, feet, shoulders and wrists. GP said I\u2019ve taken a reaction to something and gave me antihistamine tablets and steroid cream. Had to stop the cream as it\u2019s burning my skin which is still sensitive after chemo. My oncologist told me she has seen it happpen with people on letrozole. I\u2019m not sure what to do. Can\u2019t stay on antihistamine forever I\u2019m about to start radiotherapy next week... all these side effects getting me down too Â  I hope you get something to help ... hugs xx",
