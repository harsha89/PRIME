      "Content": "We have every right to have a moan :-)  Cancer is a 'big' deal. I am also told that I am strong minded but when something hits you like this you feel like you are crumbling. People are very strange, I have had them keep a wide berth from me since I told them. There are many people who tell you to be strong but if they were put in this position would also crumble. Words are easily said ! I found my breast nurse was brilliant and very supportive, hope yours is the same. It's good you are going to see her.",

      "Content": "Hi Donna, I was diagnosed with breast cancer in my left breast at the end of April. I had a lumpectomy in June and 1 of my 5 lymph nodes that were removed had cancer cells in. I have had a gene test done to check if I REALLY needed chemo as I didn't want to have it 'just in case'. I saw the oncologist who said that my risk was now low so if I really didn't want the chemo then that was ok but she wants me to have radiotherapy and I'm unsure as reading the book it still has its risks. I too have pain, sometimes throbbing, sometimes sharp, the nurses have said that it is normal after an op but it was in June!  They say that it takes a while to heal. If you are worried just call your breast clinic/dept and ask advice, it's always better to be safe than sorry.",
