      "Content": "Hello everyone, I could really do with some help. Had a mastectomy on Thursday. I was given codeine phosphate, paracetamol and ibuprofen for pain relief but codeine made me sick so advised to cut this out.  However I am constantly feeling sick from when I wake to bedtime and am in considerable pain as the painkillers aren't touching the pain I have. Just wondered if anyone had any suggestions to help as this would be greatly appreciated. Many thanks    ",

      "Content": "Hi thank you for your reply. Aching has come on in the last few days, feels like flu aching. Costochondritis started prior to rads, they said rads will aggravate, I just wasn't sure if aching all over was a side effect of rads to chest area. Everything feels an effort and brushing my teeth even whacks me out!! Is it likely to get worse? Many thanks",

Is it likely they will do more tests to see if there is cancer elsewhere Della? Its so nice to be able to talk to someone :)",

Saw consultant yesterday to discuss results of my sentinel node biopsy.  Had five nodes removed two of which are micrometastase, having a mastectomy then radiotherapy.  What I need to know is will I now undergo other tests to check if I have cancer anywhere else? as this hasn't yet been mentioned.  I just now thinking every twinge I get is cancer.  Really need psychological help as not coping at all at the moment, feeling bombarded with various dates for appointments, my poor family are going through hell with my up and down moods and I just don't know what to do or who to turn to. Please help x",
