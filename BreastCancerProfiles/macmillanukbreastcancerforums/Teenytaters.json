      "Content": "Thanks for the replies ladies. I knew it would be distressing seeing the hair coming out but I can see why people abandon the cold cap, it makes it all consuming. I woke up and felt sick with anxiety that I was going to have a ton of hair on my pillow (I didn\u2019t) and knowing it was hair wash day that I\u2019d really see a big loss. I know it\u2019s stupid and as everyone keeps saying \u2018it\u2019s just hair, it will grow back\u2019 but I\u2019m in the beginning of a new relationship and I\u2019m so frightened he will be horrified if my hair goes. I also know I should be worrying about me, not him, but it\u2019s hard as he\u2019s stuck around so far (I got diagnosed days after our first date) so I\u2019m constantly thinking \u2018if my hair goes that\u2019s when he will drift off\u2019 :-( Good luck for bloods DD. I have a lovely wig waiting, definitely go and get one as a just in case. Sending everyone love and positive vibes xxxx",

      "Content": "Thanks Helen, back to the GP today re the ear. As I had such a rough ride with my first cycle I can see me on cycle two having the same mentality - it\u2019s enough to deal with  trying to push through the side effects. Saw my oncologist yesterday and he\u2019s reducing my epirubicin dose as he said the first one was \u2018too fierce\u2019 for me and that\u2019s why I had such a bad reaction. I had convinced myself I had skin mets in the mastectomy breast and that\u2019s why it had gone red, but he said it was a reaction to the epirubicin so that was a relief. My mind is in overdrive.

      "Content": "Hi Daisydoo38, I had my first FEC 17 days ago, I am cold capping, yesterday my scalp felt exactly like that. Super sore. Today double the amount of hair I would normally lose came out. Cold cappers who are further on - does it continue going at a steady rate or speed up/slow down? My anxiety is through the roof today. My first FEC was horrendous, I can honestly say I had every side effect going, with the added complication of my mastectomy breast went bright red, they brought me back in but bloods were fine and nobody can explain why as yet. Seeing my oncologist today and I\u2019m petrified hes going to give me bad news about what is maybe going on there.  Also have an ear infection which is making me worried I\u2019ll get Friday\u2019s chemo delayed as it\u2019s still not right!

      "Content": "Hey @Coley1993, I know exactly where you\u2019re coming from. My first FEC was so horrendous I considered quitting on the second one. I cried the whole way through. The nurses were lovely and told me I was being too hard on myself. I am due my third FECon the 4th and really feel like throwing the towel in, I think it\u2019s super hard to muster up the strength to go when you know the cancer is gone and this is just \u2018belt and braces\u2019. Im also cold capping and have a huge bald patch on the top of my head. I suspect I won\u2019t be allowed to continue when they see me.  Really struggling with the hair loss situation. I\u2019m in denial and can\u2019t bring myself to cut my hair off. Still able to disguise by tying what\u2019s left into a comb over style top knot.  Everyone is encouraging me to keep going but I think come the 4th my parents will be dragging me kicking and screaming again! My Oncotype score was 40 though so I am trying to tell myself it\u2019s the rest of my life I\u2019m fighting for.  Hope you\u2019re ok, you\u2019re young and have your whole life ahead of you - stay strong and whatever decision you make - it\u2019s your choice.  R xx",
