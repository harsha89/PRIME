    "Content": "I never asked the statistics and have no intention of being a statistic I'm on chemo number 4 in 2 weeks time and merrily struggling through this in my own way. I think we are all so different, we all respond differently and we will all have different outcomes, I think worrying about whether it will come back is not going to help you get through this stage. There is no point making this any more difficult than it is. Don't compare yourself with other people you need to fight for you. Don't get me wrong I have had my wallow in self pity days but to be honest I don t feel any better for having them, so I shall be having no more - as my consultant said at the beginning - I had cancer they removed it and now I need to focus on making sure it doesn't come back.Â  Don't torture yourself any more than you are being tortured by all this. Be strong and you will get better - sorry if that doesn't make sense - kinda went on a ramble there - it make sense in my head and I hope it helps!!",
