      "Content": "Hi Everyone,  I had chemo with Taxotere (3 rounds). My hair grew back initially (although thinner). I thought I was one of the lucky ones who escaped the terrible side effect of permanent hair loss, but I was wrong. My hair gradually got thinner and thinner over time. At this point, I am guessing I have less than 50% of my hair. I am scared to death that the thinning will continue. If that happens, I will have to wear a wig.  My hair follicles have been permanently damaged by Taxotere and I was never warned. It's such a violation!! I am so angry and sad. I am trying to get some idea of whether or not my hair will get worse. Please reply if you had a similar experience - if you thought your hair had grown back only to find that it thinned out terribly over the next couple years.  Here are my questions... How much hair did you get back initially?  How much hair do you have now? And how long has it been since you finished treatment? Has your hair stopped thinning? I am also curious as to why I haven't heard of any women getting a hair transplant. I am guessing that there isn't enough good hair left to use. Please let me know if you know anyone who has had a hair transplant after taxotere - or even any one who has looked into it. Thanks for you help!",

      "Content": "Pmcd, As you probably already know - you are not alone. I am facing the exact same situation and I totally understand how painful it is. I initially got my hair back, but then it began thinning terribly over time. I have less than half my hair. It sounds like the same thing happened to you.I don't have any answers at this point. From what I've learned there is no way to re-grow the lost hair.  I am trying to find out if anyone has had success with a hair transplant and I just put a post up about my own experience.  This is not a minor thing. It is life changing. I am in a daze because I'm not sure how to go on with life. Just wanted to let you know that your feelings are valid. This is such a tragedy. ",
