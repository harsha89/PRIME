    "Content": "Hi All, I have her2 positive type 3 breast cancer, caught early, not  spread so very good prognosis. I have had 3 flec t treatments,( caused me so much feeling sick)  now moving on to next chemo  Trastuzumab (Herceptin) and pertuzumab + dioxin??? Not sure about last drug if one of the above? Talk is about putting in a pic line but really not keen as i tend to pull them out in my sleep when i have had them in the past, plus im over an hour away from hospital so having to go weekly not so good.  I have been advised moving my arms, massaging viens with cream,  anyone tried anything else please they have found helpful?  I cant seem to get an answer as to the long term effect of this, or how well they will recover after my chemo finishes.  I have 3 more chemos, one more of something eles then surgery.  15 radiation treatments after surgery then few herceptin imjections and hopfully my treatment plan is concluded :-)  Any advice warmly received. :-) xxx ",
