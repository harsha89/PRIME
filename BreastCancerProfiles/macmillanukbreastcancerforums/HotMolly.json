      "Content": "Is there anyone out there who has had problems with their newly reconstructed breast (implant)? I had a double mastectomy in July and reconstruction straight after. Since then I had an infection 3 times in one breast which is my non cancerous breast. As a result I had to have multiple operations to wash/clean out the infection. I now have a small hole in that breast and it leaks nearly every day. It is starting to really upset me. Can anyone help me to get through this please.",
