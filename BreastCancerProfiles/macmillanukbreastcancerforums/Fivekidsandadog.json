    "Content": "Hi is anyone else on this regime - I'm on weekly taxol for 12 weeks with herceptin 3 weekly and tamoxifen to follow. I've had 3 lot's of taxol and don't really know what to expect - particularly with hair loss as I've lost none so far anywhere on my body.I've had few other side effecuts except tiredness and achey legs but I've heard taxol is cumulative. I've not met anyone else just on taxol and even my chemo nurse hasn't treated anyone with taxol alone! Any help would be appreciated!",
