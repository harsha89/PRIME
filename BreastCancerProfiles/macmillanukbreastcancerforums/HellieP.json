    "Content": "They do seem to vary ao it must depend on the surgeons and hospital practice. I\u2019m having reconstruction in a couple of weeks and thought I\u2019d get prepared with some post surgery bras from M&S. I showed them to the bsn nurse but they are not right because they cut a hole at the front for checking and these were very slightly padded. She has suggested back fastening sports bra-no wire, cotton from Tesco or M&S but cheap as it won\u2019t be useable after. A chest size higher but same cup. High firm control pants from Primark with cotton underneath If you want for comfort - also quite cheap. I have yet to purchase any of said items however! Not sure what else I\u2019ll need to take-cool button up front nightshirt or pyjamas and a book perhaps. Good luck to everyone going in this week.Â ",
