      "Content": "My wife had an LD flap reconstruction at the time of her mastectomy 4.5 years ago, and ever since has had what amounts to a weak back.  She is 57 now, and pre-cancer was very fit. The weakness in her back seems to be down to the obvious imbalance between the muscles due to the absence of her LD on one side.  She's now 18 months into a program of physio and Pilates which is very slowly improving matters, but she still feels that she has a long way to go to get where she wants to be. That's the background, so now to my questions.  Are we alone in thinking that when we were told before the op that she would really only notice a difference in the strength of her back and shoulders after the reconstruction if she was a very keen swimmer or tennis player, that was not quite the whole story? And following on from this, did other ladies here who've had LD flap reconstructions do a program of exercises or have physio sessions afterwards to help regain their strength?",

      "Content": "Thank you very much for your input, ladies :)  Tracey, don't let this worry you - my wife was very fit indeed pre-op with a BMI of 22 at age 50.  She was well on the way to getting practically all her strength back by around 18 months, and was regularly spending a full day tending the allotment as well as the veg garden at home.  That was until a physiotherapist damaged a nerve and put her back to where she was maybe 6 months post-op, and matters haven't exactly been helped by her having a hysterectomy less than a year after she finished radio, but such is life! As far as we're concerned, in retrospect the only downside to the whole breast cancer thing (mastectomy, LD flap, chemo, radio and anastrozole) is that we weren't aware at the time that she may need to work on her back afterwords and she wasn't offered any physio. Present state of play is that with me massaging her back every day, her Pilates exercises and seemingly-perpetual physio appointments, we're slowly getting there. We just wish we'd been aware of this back issue immediately post-op, but apart from this it's all good, considering what might have been ...",

      "Content": "Hello :) My wife had a mastectomy and LD flap reconstruction with implant in February 2011. She is 53, her BMI is 25 and she is in good health apart from the back pain which is the reason I'm posting this. Since the reconstruction, she has experienced muscle spasms in her back on the re-arranged side (her left), in the area below the primary scar (which is under the back of her bra).  We understand that this is down to the way in which her back muscles work since the operation, and to general muscle weakness in that area. In January this year, she strained a muscle in her left lower back, which caused other muscles in to tighten over the affected area to protect it.  We know that this injury was muscular, and that there is no underlying condition, but she is still getting spasms in that area. The present situation is that there seems to be some sort of connection between the spasms in her lower back and those higher up on the same side in that one seems to trigger the other.  Be that as it may, the nett result is that she has very tight muscles on the left side of her lower back which need stretching, heat and massage with a spiky massage ball, and both spasming and weakness higher up her back which needs looking at by her surgeon (appointment made). Neither is painful in the sense of needing paracetamol, but the combined effect is that apart from the fact that her back is constantly playing up, she is prevented from getting back into the load-bearing exercise which she urgently needs to do to help prevent her osteopoenia turning into full-blown osteoporosis. (She is 3 years into 5 years of arimidex, and is taking alendronic acid.  Her calcium intake is OK) She's been seeing physiotherapists for 4 months now and doing Pilates classes for almost as long.  Even though she's very conscientious about doing the exercises, the improvement is only slight, and we still seem to be in a chicken-and-egg situation at times when some of the exercises she needs to do for one area trigger a spasm in the other! Have any of you ladies out there experienced anything remotely similar?",

      "Content": "Nope, not dismissing acupuncture at all :) We just feel that we haven't exhausted \"conventional\" therapy yet and we don't want to complicate matters when we're still trying to evaluate exactly what effects physio and Pilates are having. If we hit a dead end, acupuncture's actually first on the list.",

      "Content": "Cheers for that Dorothee :) We've only actually been struggling with this particular issue since January this year when she hurt her back.  Up until then, the spasms in her left upper back were not too much of a problem, and besides, my wife had other issues to contend with. The Pilates classes do seem to be helping matters, although as you no doubt know Pilates isn't any kind of quick fix.  She's into Pilates now for the long haul! I note what you say about acupuncture, but for the time being we want to keep things conventional, then if we really do get nowhere, we'll consider some of the alternatives. Anyhow, we're off to see her surgeon and the breast care nurse a week today, so I'll post an update when we have one.  By the way, I do always accompany my wife - if nothing else, she still has a bit of chemo brain ...",
