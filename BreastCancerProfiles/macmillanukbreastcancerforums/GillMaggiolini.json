      "Content": "Hello everyone I wanted to ask if anyone here has had the regime Taxol 12 weeks then FEC for 3 cycles every third week then surgery I have herceptin positive cancer and because the tumour was quite difficult to find I believe this is why they are doing it this way. I forget everything at the moment L taking it day by day so it is unimportant really as I just have to do it my question is \u2013 I have found the Taxol,  Herceptin and Cold cap quite manageable and carried on a fairly normal life. Working and socialising etc but I am REALLY scared of the FEC now They have told me that they are giving me 3 not 4 of a higher dose as I have managed the taxol so well Anyone had the same regime How did anyone find FEC ? Forewarned is prearmed or is it the other way around ...  Appreciate any advise hints or tips Thank you all  ",

      "Content": "thank you all for your responses - I am not sure what mx and ANC is ? Kiera when you say you were sick were you actually throwing up or just feeling unwell ? I know it sounds so daft but knowing if I am probably going to be actually sick will help me plan my days after chemo a little better with my daugher and then it is fantastic that you guys seemed to be ok for most of it in the weeks after ! I am actually walking 2.5 miles most days as with my implant port I am not sure how much gym I should or can do ... I used to do body pump but they have told me not to lift weights over my head with the implant port as it may unlodge it .. I wish I had used this site before now .. :-) talking the head off my husband is probably wearing a bit thin on him now after 11 weeks ! bless him  ",

      "Content": "I have weekly taxol and hear that's easier than 3 weekly I found appart from the first week of taxol when I had an allergic reaction I have found the 12 weeks quite easy with the odd day of hangover type symptoms They doubled steroids and that sorted that one out Herceptin makes you feel like you have slight flue for couple nights but I just took paracetamol and that sorted that I also have valium to help me sleep if I need it :-) I will do anything to make it easier !! I have a full head of hair still after cold cap and even coloured it ! But I have set expectations to myself it will fall out with fec .'so have wig at ready :-) I guess that's why I am so scared of fec as have had it easy so far Will let you know how it goes .....",
