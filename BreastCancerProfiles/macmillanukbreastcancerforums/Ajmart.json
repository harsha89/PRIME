      "Content": "Hi I had a lumpectomy and 3 lymph nodes out on the 24 nov , but when results came back had cancer in one , so last Friday 15 dec I had a complete lymph node clearance, was a longer surgery but again I felt ok had full movement of my arm , no drain, under my arm and back of arm is numb but that was expected, a strange feeling of dripping in my arm, but not pain , was back in clinic yesterday and did have to have fluid drained I ended up having 22 nodes out but all clear, saw oncologist today and come in 2% of the margin for chemo so with the help of the oncologist have desided not on chemo , he started my hormone therapy today and see another oncologist on 12 jan to arrange my radiotherapy, id advice do your arm exercises and keep positive, listen to your body, I do feel a lot more tiered after this surgery, good luck and let us know how you get on xx hope this helps you xx",

      "Content": "Hi , I had a lumpectomy on the 24 nov with 3 lymph nodes removed, on results I had cancer cells in one of the 3 nodes, I was told I would need a complete node clearance which I had done on the 15 dec . I must admit a longer harder operation longer recovery I felt very tiered after this one , I was signed off work for 6 weeks but have just gone back after 3 weeks on light duties, reduced hours, I have seen an oncologist where I was told I dont really need chemo , I had 22  nodes plus the original 3 removed with only the one having cancer,, I am on hormone therapy tablets and seeing oncologist again on friday to arrange my radiotherapy, after this surgery I ended up with swelling around the wound area I had this drained in clinic but it came straight back , and is now just about gone on its own occord, numb in arm pit and sensitive on the top half of the arm now but I think this is the nerves knitting togeather hoping this will get better , all in all im happier the lymph nodes are gone as I think id always be worrying that more had had the cancer , hope this helps you xxxx",
