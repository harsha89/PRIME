      "Content": "Afternoon everyone, had my chemo consult last Wednesday with  my partner. All was well until he explained that my cancer MAY be hereditary as my material aunt died of breast cancer at 54 ,I'm 48. I'll be joining a trial that enables you to have the test and get results in 2 weeks. I have 2 grown up daughter that I'm worried about.  Also my cancer is potentially high at coming back. I'll be having chemo in next 2-3 weeks. Fec-t. Reading people's story's on here I'm capping myself, not for chemo, or loosing my hair. .It is what it is.. its the side effects you all are having trouble with ie nausea sickness pain in legs etc. . Does anyone no anything I could do be doing to help myself get through this. I'm usually in good spirits but all this is plaguing me. Xx",
