      "Content": "Hi there. I can completely appreciate how your mum feels!!Had first dose on Tuesday and now in agony!! Pains kicked in last night at 21.30 about an hour after the steroid buzz left me. No proper sleep since Sunday now due to steroids and chemo. Very very waring. Joints in feet particularly sore so walking difficult.Trying to keep moving but not easy!! Please tell me that this will not go on for months!! Have to eventually get back to work as husband has been made redundant. What a year!",

      "Content": "Thanks Esmaralda7!! The thought of putting in a suppository brings tears to my eyes!! They are on the outside (although there might be some inside as well for all i know!!). I hoped that I could lead the way with the cream and progress to thinking about the internal problem. Do you think that your problem was connected to the chemo? When I typed haemorrhoids in here there was nothing much on the subject.Mind you might have misspelt it!!  Haven't suffered from these things since i was pregnant so I feel that it is connected to something going on chemo wise.",

      "Content": "Hi there, just wanted to ask if anyone else has experienced the rather delicate problem that i am experiencing at the moment!! I had my second dose of FEC last week and since around that time i have suffered from the most painful heamorrhoids. I know that chemo can constipate but I took precautions about that. Going daily but the pain is terrible. And not only when on the toilet but all the time. Even passing wind (which seems to have increased with chemo) is agony. I have bought some cream for it but think I need more than over the counter medcine can offer!! I would appreciate any advice around as this is my biggest problem at the moment.",

      "Content": "Hi there!! Not been online for a few days, have had visitors!! Went to see my oncologist last week and told him about my problem. i have since seen a surgeon and have been diagnosed with an anal fissure which I have a GTN cream to put on twice a day!! Apparently the thing that I thought was a pile is some weird thing left over from my botched episiotomy after the birth of my first child!! Still a bit painful after 'going', but no longer bleeding and pain better controlled over the day and night. I also got some lactulose to take daily. Think I will need it as third lot of chemo is next week and that seems to constipate something terrible which probably caused the problem in the first place!!",
