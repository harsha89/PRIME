    "Content": "Hi Ive recently been diagnosed and start chemo next week. I'm having a PICC line put in so would be grateful for any tips on that. Main worry though is that CT scan showed couple of suspicious areas on liver but awaiting MRI of liver to confirm. I'm told if its there then its not curable but aim to control it-I'm not sure what that actually means.Â ",
