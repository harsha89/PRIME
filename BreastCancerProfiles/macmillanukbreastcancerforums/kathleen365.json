    "Content": "Hi I tried to find a discussion I saw in November on this site describing a drug that was a kinder version of Tamoxifen.  I cant find the blog.  Can anyone else remember seeing it? I am struggling on my 7th month with all the side effects you have described.  The lack of sleep really affects my clinical judgements at work.  My Oncologist recommended Diazepam! No comment.",
