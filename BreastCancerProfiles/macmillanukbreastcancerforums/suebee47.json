      "Content": "Hi Gillian I had chemo from September to January. I was fine for the first four treatments but when I had the treatment changed for the next four treatments they knocked me out completely and I was literally on my hands and knees trying to get around our flat. I didn't apply for a blue badge as by the time it would have come through (if I had been fortunate enough to get one that is) I was well enough to walk about again.  I had a lumpectomy and then a mastectomy. I think you can only get a blue badge if you qualify for the mobility element of DLA which is where I think the 50 metre rule comes into effect. I am now having radiotherapy and have to travel 104 miles every day for three weeks Take care Sue",

      "Content": "Hi Helen I had those side effects and was literally crawling around my flat on my hands and knees.  I ended up in hospital with low white cell count.  My Oncologist prescribed some injections to eleminate the white cell problem and I was okay after that. Good luck with your treatment. Sue",
