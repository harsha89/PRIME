      "Content": "Hi there, there are so many different stories about Letrozole. I have been taking it for the last 9 months it has always been the same brand Accord. When I started I had pains and aches which have eased off now, just get the occassional twinges which I put down to wear and tear, I am 59 and worked as a Nurse for most of my life. I do get tired easily but that could be following the treatment radio and chemo. I would say try and persevere, there are lots of different brands which I'm sure you will read about on here from other ladies experiences. Good luck X",
