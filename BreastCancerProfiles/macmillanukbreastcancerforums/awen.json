      "Content": "I lost a lot of weight with chemo my hips stuck out and ribs seemed to be bigger than my bust, clothes 2 sizes smaller than my usual size 12 hung on me. When the chemo and radio finished and after a few months of tamoxifen I started putting on weight  I started tipping the scales at over the normal weight for me and my asthma got worse I had chest pains trying to climb the stairs at home and no matter how I tried to lose that weight it just kept creeping on. I gained 2 stone in a year and couldn't walk up a mild hill or steps without pain and breathless/ dizziness. Then I joined slimmers world, I lost half a stone in 5 weeks and the chest pains subsided. Then my brand of tamoxifen was discontinued and I had none to take for 2 months while I was waiting for the oncologist to talk to me and it was much easier to lose the weight. I am now back to my pre cancer weight and much happier and fitter.",

      "Content": "Hi I too had the same choice though my big percentage was lower than yours but again I was told that radiotherapy would higher it and tamoxifen would greatly increase it by another 3% and chemo only by 3% I queried the word 'only' and was told that tamoxifen would be over a 5 year period where the chemo was just for 8 to 9 months so tamoxifen was more long term. They said it was my decission. When I chose the chemo as well because if it returned and I hadnt chosen it first time around it would be my fault and I would give myself a hefty kick ! they said good I had made the right decission !! The way I saw it was.... if you only have 90p for the lottery ticket you will never win. Accept everything they offer. I never regreted my choice despite the hair loss , nausea and job loss. I stayed positive instead of dwelling on the treatment side effects and the days went quicker. when laid out on the couch I watched comedy dvds, played my favourite music and chatted with upbeat friends. Good luck, and try to keep upbeat , the time will go much quicker. Awen xx  ",
