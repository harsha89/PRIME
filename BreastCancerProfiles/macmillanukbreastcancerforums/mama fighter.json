      "Content": "ok - I haven't actually started treatment yet, but the 6 weeks since finding the lump which is now known as Brenda, I have struggled with motivation to do very much. I was previously training for a 10k (I had got to 8k pre Brenda) but I was feeling my fitness ebbing away. whilst I'm waiting for yet more tests before treatment can start, my other half has been nagging me to go for a walk as she knows how great it is for my mental health. well yesterday (as she had written it on my to do list for the umpteenth time) I did. well I actually went for a little shuffle (aka snail pace run) and shuffled 2.5k with a 1k walk afterwards. it felt so good. I know that when I do actually start chemo I need to try and factor in a walk whenever I can drag myself out, as the benefits are immediate but last the whole day too. well done to all you truly inspirational ladies, you are getting out there even when its the last thing you feel like doing xxx",

The first made me sick but they gave me a Emend for the second and I was barely nauseous. I hav3 felt pretty wiped from day 4-7 but then I pick up quite quickly.  How was the weekly paclitaxol?  Xx",
