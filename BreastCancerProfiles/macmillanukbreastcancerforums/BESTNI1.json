      "Content": "I too feel the same . I moved house on the Tuesday and was told I had cancer on the Wednesday. The complication is our house is being renovated and so I am house hopping , my husband is staying nearer his work as it is a brand new job. I am now staying in a friends flat, which is barely furnished but in a lovely location so an opportunity to rest. I have been coping exceptionally well up until I fell over and have done something to my upper arm and shoulder, typical it had to be the side that I had my operation. So now i am in pain controlled by codeine . Limited use of my shoulder and really feeling sorry for myself. But I will get through this and in a couple of weeks the house will be ready . But when you show your coping, everyone seems to forget. Interestingly , a few friends have backed off because they feel uncomfortable but you do find out who are your true and real friends. Onwards and upwards.....we all will get through it and if we need help then we must ask for it...if only to have a chat over a cup of coffee or this forum!",

      "Content": "Hi I am inclined to agree with all Ali comments. I have past experience working in the oncology area and the one thing that I am confident about is that Oncologists make their decisions on hard factual evidence.. I also believe that complimentary medicines have their place ( a user myself) but for me \" alternatives\" would have to have good robust data to convince me that it works. Expensive drugs are reviewed on their clinical data by NICE and if the evidence is good then they should be approved, plus there are other ways to access new drugs through the cancer drug fund, individual funding requests applied by your consultant. But surgery is necessary and this is just part of the journey. BC is not like it was years ok, the overall survival rate has increased continually through the treatment pathway - surgery- radiotherapy-chemo Your oncology team want the very best for you and action is essential . cancer effects the whole family and the choices that I personally make are based on how the outcome will effect not just me but my loved ones. I think some people will really benefit from having time to discuss their feelings with a councillor / therapist to come to terms with it. Side effects and surgery are not very pleasant - giving birth is the most painful, challenging time for any woman but look at the end result. - something's are just worth it, Good luck",

My lymph nodes under my arm are corded and now got restricted use of the arm and I haven't driven for 3 weeks now. Still waiting for physio appt. but the pain in the shoulder travelling down to the elbow is excruciating ! I have tried codine, arcoxia but nothing is touching it. I start chemo next Friday and I want this sorted out before that starts. So I am going to take the advise and start being assertive and demand a solution . A diagnosis would be good.

      "Content": "Hi All, I've just had a lumpectomy and 4 nodes taken out and will get my results on Wednesday . I am at this stage hormone positive. Awaiting Her 2 results as you can be both. Support from the cancer team absolutely superb but very disappointed with the hospital. I felt as we were day patients, it was about getting us through system as quickly as possible and little acknowledgement about why we're there. I am coping with my journey very well but those people who are not would find the hospital experience challenging. Anyway, my question is 3 year ago I had a FULL hysterectomy with ovaries removed as well. I was then on HRT. As I have diagnosed with hormone positive cancer so it will be recommended that I go on Tamoxifen and of course if have stopped HRT immediately. If I am not producing oestrogen or prostesterone as I haven't got any ovaries , then why to I need to take tamoxifen . It was the HRT that was feeding the cancer. Hope this make sense. I am just trying to understand the logic, there bound to be a reason but the penny hasn't dropped yet. Thanks",
