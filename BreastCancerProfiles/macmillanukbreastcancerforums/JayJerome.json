      "Content": "Hi Rosie, How kind of you to take time to answer my post.  I had never realised how different all these cancers were, so I guess no two are alike. My partner is fairly well right now, although he does have some bad days now and again, but regular visits to the gym where he works very hard are doing wonders for his mobility, and his confidence. This is why I want to have the op fairly soon, whilst he is able to support me and not need me to look after him. Who knows how he will be in the next year or two? Thanks for the tips on bras. In fact we already plan to go to M & S tomorrow so will have a scout round then. I do hope you are managing despite the chemo. I do wish you well. JayJ x",

      "Content": "Maybe I am very naive, but I thought that if the DCIS is contained and not invasive, and I had a mastectomy to get rid of it, following a recovery period of a few weeks, I would be well and can put it all behind me, a bit like having the appendix out!  However, today I met someone who had the same, and her story wasn't so encouraging. In September I underwent an horrendously painful biopsy using the mammogram machine, but I bled so much cos I was on warfarin, that they only managed to get 2 samples instead of 12.  The subsequent haematoma in the breast hid the area they needed to look at, and  although the haematoma has subsided a bit, it is still there!  A few weeks later I had a biopsy in a different area using a scan, and I didnt feel a thing!  I have since been on 2 injections daily of heparin, instead of warfarin, and my stomach is bruised and battered and quite sore. I have now been told I have dcis in at least 3 areas, and have been told some options, but my mind is quite made up that I want a mastectomy.  I need to be fit to look after my partner in the future as he has Parkinson's so I want it done asap.   I am due to see the consultant next Tuesday, so may know more then, but I would like to hear about others who have been through this and find out about their recovery times, and any more details I should be aware of.. I prefer to know everything, I don't like being unprepared, or have unpleasant surprises. Many thanks, in anticipation. JayJ",

      "Content": "Hello ScriptFan,  It sounds like you have a more difficult journey to  walk than I do. I doubt I will be having chemo, from what they have said about the 'large mass of calcification' they found. Glad to hear they found no cancer after your chemo. I hope it, and the lumpectomy does the job.  All my best wishes for your recovery, and hope the radiotherapy isn't too tiring. Thank you for taking time to reply to me. JayJ",

      "Content": "Thank you Beachwalker19.. That is very helpful. I am not having a reconstruction at all... I have AF (hence the warfarin) so a GA is a bigger risk than normal, for me. I don't want to be on the table any longer than necessary. The lady I spoke to today had radiotherapy, and 14 months later is only able to raise her arm to shoulder level, and often feels unwell. She said she lived in pyjamas for 3 months, so I am a little worried that my expectations of a quick recovery are a a bit unrealistic.  I was hoping to return to the gym  and work (which involves some lifting)  after about 6 weeks! I may know more after Tuesday, specially as to whether or not I have radiotherapy.  Were the drains in because you had an immediate reconstruction? or are they standard procedure for a mastectomy?  What is a node clearance?  No, Ive not invested in any bras as yet, but I like the idea of front fastening ones!  I will look in M & S on Sunday :) Thank you for taking time to tell me your experience. Best wishes, JayJ",
