      "Content": "Hi   I have my second chemo next week. I shaved my head before chemo as didn\u2019t want to experience the hair loss as well as everything else. My daughter cut it and then a friend shaved it. I did a sponsor me thing on Facebook and with old work colleagues and raised £1000 for cancer research. I found it really good to make something positive out of what could have been a really negative thing and am not bothered about the hair at all it\u2019s just all the other crap side effects I\u2019ve had! I\u2019m on day 12 and only just starting to feel better save for crippling stomach cramps! I\u2019m so looking forward to my \u201cnormal\u201d week next week! Going to make plans every day And really enjoy it before the next lot xxx",

      "Content": "Hello anyone out there. I found out four days ago I have grade three invasive ductal breast cancer and the two lymph nodes they did biopsy\u2019s on also have cancer cells. My tumour is 45mm. I know it isn\u2019t hormonal but waiting for her2 results. I am absolutely petrified. I am not handling it well at all. My whole body feels like there is something wrong and my head is all over the place. I have my ct scan on Wednesday and then an mri. I\u2019m meeting my oc on Thursday to discuss the plan but they have already told me that it will be chemo then surgery then radiotherapy. I am so scared it has already spread everywhere and I am imagining that it\u2019s in my brain and everywhere. I try to Be positive but I just can\u2019t get over the fear and can\u2019t sleep or eat. I am 29 years old, single mum and I have a four year old daughter who is my everything. I feel so sad and guilty about what this will mean for her. Any help advice stories of anyone with similar circumstances would be so appreciated. Thank you xxx",

      "Content": "Thank you so much for all your kind responses. I have calmed down a bit now, acceptance begins to sink in. My ct scan was clear which made me so so happy and more determined to fight. Mri showed lymph nodes which I already know about, and that my other lymph nodes on my left side are reactive whatever that means. I found out I\u2019m her2 positive and I was given herceptin and chemo on Thursday and Friday this week. I feel drained this weekend and my body feels heavy but other than that I think it\u2019s being kind to me so far.  I go from one day thinking that I will be ok, the next day thinking oh my god I\u2019m going to die. I\u2019ve given u reading take a break and that\u2019s life as every other story is about someone who has died from breast cancer. I shaved my head for cancer research before I began the chemo and raised £1000 so I was really happy about that Survivor stories give me so much hope and motivation so thank you so much for all the kind ladies that have responded xxx",
