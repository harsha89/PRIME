I'll see how the tightness goes over the next few weeks and follow your advice if it doesn't improve - I feel better knowing that if it does persist at least there is a solution!  Thanks and good luck to you too with your healing xx",

      "Content": "Hi All, I've held off posting on here thinking that I'm over reacting and should be more patient but am lying awake now when it is most uncomfortable with all these questions so here goes. I had RS mastectomy with immediate implant reconstruction on 10th May. ER+ HER2+ 2 lymph nodes removed and both clear. EC chemo to start 13th June.  I had problems with the drains not working and had a large and painful build up of fluid and when the wound was checked at my follow up appointment the skin was looking pretty unhealthy so I was back in the next day, 24th May for it to be trimmed and re-sutured.  It felt immediately better but 2 weeks later I am still really uncomfortable. I don't know if this is normal and if I'm just being impatient. The wound is healing in time for chemo to start 13th June so that's good but I have a lot of discomfort under the implant and towards my back. My surgeon says this is where the mesh is stitched in to the muscle. It feels very tight but also feels like it's sitting on my rib and sometimes, like now, I lean to my left to ease the pain - will this ease over time? And if so how long is reasonable time? I also have a dip at the top where the implant meets my tissue- will that improve too?   The implant is quite a bit bigger than my normal boob but I'm assuming that will settle down over time.  My arm movement is also frustrating as I am still struggling to raise it above shoulder level. Not helped by the fact that I pulled a muscle or something in my shoulder area before I found my lump and all this started! I feel like I have a small taut elastic band in my armpit.  Any advice would be much appreciated, thanks xxx",

      "Content": "Thanks for your replies, they're a massive help and reassurance that I'm not being totally paranoid!  I've tried avoid painkillers over the last week as much as possible but maybe not doing myself any favours so have taken some now Fiddlercrab and try the exercises if half an hour. I love your last line - it could so be me! :)  I've also called the physio at the hospital and they are calling me back to discuss how I'm feeling. I'm back for 1st chemo next Tuesday so will speak to BCN then about it too if it's not resolved by the physio.  I can't wait to get back into my little car and being able to go wherever i want instead of relying on lifts. Everyone's been great but i''m probably that but too independent and not good at asking for favours. I've been so irritable too, taking it out on those closest who have been total superstars - especially my 81yr old mum!  Thanks again, it's amazing how much it helps xx",

Worth a try! Hope it helps xx",
