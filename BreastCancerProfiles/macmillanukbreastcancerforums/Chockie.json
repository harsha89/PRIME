      "Content": "Hi thanks for the reply.  My cancer wasn't picked up on the mammogram either it was found by chance as I had a small cyst and it was just next to it. I am so glad that they were unable to get clearance on the lumpectomies as when they removed my breastfeeding there was three other tumours found. All that I have been told us that there is nothing much left to check as I have had both breasts removed. Why are you taking a spring if you don't mind me asking? I don't really know what to look for when checking myself as lobular cancer isn't a lump or at least mine weren't.   I'm really glad you are getting lots of support.  Chockie",

      "Content": "Hi just wondering if anyone has had this type of cancer? I have had treatment 2 lumpectomies followed by a bilateral mystectomy and chemo but as I don't get any follow up now I feel rather anxious. I was on tamoxifen but had my ovaries out due to 2 sisters with ovarian cancer. I am now on letrozole. I was diagnosed when I was 48 and am now 51. Anyone know what the likelihood of a recurrence is? Feel quite alone with this one. ",
