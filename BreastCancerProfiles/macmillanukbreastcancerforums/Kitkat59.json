      "Content": "Hi Everyone, Been such a long time since I posted on here but, I do still pop on and read some posts. So it's been 13 months since my last chemo in December 2016, and a bit less time for the rads which finished in February 2017.  Had my first mammogram in July 2017 got the all clear and I thought, everything was getting back to normal.   Then the chest infections came :(  the first one lasted 4 weeks and with lots of antibiotics did go.   Only to return about 5 weeks later in November 2017.  Breathless and constantly coughing up tons of nasty stuff, feeling so tired all I want to do is sleep.  After 3 visits to the doctor in which time I had a one week course of antibiotics, and steroids which didn't help I eventually got lucky and saw a different doctor.  He did a really thorough job in listening and tapping my chest unlike the other one.  He said my left lung sounded different. So tomorrow I go for a chest x-ray and he has marked it urgent so should get the result on Thurs or Friday coming.  So now I am thinking.....what if I have lung cancer?   My thoughts are all doom and gloom at the moment.  Only my husband and eldest daughter know as my other daughter would be in bits if I told her.  Will wait and see what the actual results say.  What if the results are ok?  Do I ask for a CT scan?  Or just leave it and hope these new antibiotics I now have for 2 weeks will do the job?  I also have tonsillitis at the moment too, so feel really sorry for myself :(      I had hoped I would get to see my 2 little grand daughters grow up, now?  Sorry, can't vent to anyone else as they really wouldn't understand how I feel at the moment.  Like they say, you have to have been there to understand. Gillian ",

The 2nd and 3rd dose were nowhere near as bad as the first though, so I guess it's true that your body does get used to it. You are a wonderful girl, taking time out of uni to look after your mum.  I am sure she really appreciates your help.  Take care xxx",

Both my parents died in their 60s due to cancer, stomach and throat, they both smoked, I do not.  So I have always assumed I would too. Dying doesn't scare me, just the pain for others we leave behind.  I laugh and joke when at the hospital or with my family but, inside it is with me all the time. This black cloud called Cancer, like a bad smell.  When I am laughing with family, I am crying inside.  Because I know that the clock is ticking and with or without treatment we all die.  My cancer will return, just a matter of when.  All Her2 positive cancers do eventually return, unless you die from something else.  Of course I want to live, who doesn't?  But....at what price?  I have decided I would rather have 3 plus years of a great life than being miserable and not enjoying my family.  I have a 50% chance of living 5 plus years, well I will take that.  I think tonight I will finally sleep peacefully.  Thank you xxx",

I am 57 and so tired of feeling ill and feel like my life is passing me by. If I was perhaps 15 years younger perhaps I would feel differently but I am not and I don't. I am only a grade 2 cancer but Her2 positive with no lymph nodes with the cancer. I had the lead nodes removed. I read that cancer cells can lay dormant for countless years so any treatment now would be totally useless.  My older sister had breast cancer 16 years ago and she is still alive. No chemo just radiotherapy. I am definitely going to talk to my onc about this and probably refuse any more treatment. This will upset my daughter but I cannot live my life suffering like I am. I probably don't have much time left anyway and want to be able to enjoy what I have left. If this is selfish, then yes I am.  Sorry if this upsets everyone else. Just how I have come to feel.",

Taken two lots of pain killers but still there.  Whether I lay down or sit up it won't go.  Drinking plenty so can't be that.  And thanks x",

Had my teeth checked just a few weeks ago, x Ray's etc and all was well. Since it's the BH I will ring the chemo unit tomorrow and see if a temp cover or something can be attached. And try and remember to eat on the other side lol.  Trust me eh? Never been lucky in my life. Thanks for the email address.  Gillian x",

Rang the hospital and was just told to keep an eye on it as I may have a virus. How often do I need to check my temperature? Been doing it every 2/3 hours. Is this too often?  Would appreciate anyone replying. Am drinking lots and have the fan on. Gillian x",

You can't catch it by hugging me or talking to me\"  Is it just me or does everyone change towards you after your diagnosis?  They seem to avoid me like the plague now :(",
