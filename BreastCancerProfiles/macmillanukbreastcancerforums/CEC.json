      "Content": "Hi I have just been diagnosed with breast cancer and have my 'MOT' on Monday 9th (My Birthday!) and my operation scheduled for next Thursday 12th, how are you all so brave?, I cant stop shaking, all i want to do is cry, cant concentrate and I am petrified, when i try and read up about what is going to happen and what to expect it really does sound horrific and very painful, although i am 59 (On Monday) I lead an active life with horses and 3 German Shepard's, will i  still be able to look after them properly...I cant open up to my daughter as she is not handling the news very well at all, I do realize this sounds a dreadfully selfish post when everyone on here has gone through it and for that i apologize - I just dont know how to cope.",

      "Content": "Hi Sharkay, Keep strong, I go in for my operation this Thursday 12th, its weird how everything just seems to go on as normal around you isn't it? Even I am still in denial to a degree I suppose but i am completely unable to concentrate (will feel different after Thursday no doubt), I am one of the lucky ones, I should only need radiotherapy, I do so hope everything goes well for you and everything crossed you don't need chemo. ",
