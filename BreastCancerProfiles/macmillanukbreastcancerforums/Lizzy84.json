      "Content": "I spoke to the surgeon who is operating on me last week and he told me that he will not put drains in my tummy after my diep. I've heard they are important to prevent seromas or haematomas. Is this wise of him. I am also concerned that he is quite inexperienced compared to another surgeon who was going to operate on me. He has done 5 flaps I think. He became slightly offended when I asked him whether other experienced surgeons would be in the operating room. He replied they have varied experiences. I don't want to be treated like his guinea pig.  I'm also having my operation on a Friday and don't know if surgeons will be in the hospital overnight or in on Saturday. I will be in the critical care unit for 24 hrs after the operation.  This is a crucial time to ensure the flap does not die. I think I read the surgeon has performed only 5 operations. Can I find out the surgeons track record for flaps or breast reconstruction successes. Would that be available to me? I need to know as it's my body being operated on. How can I find out? I'm at the royal marsden.  Lizzy",
