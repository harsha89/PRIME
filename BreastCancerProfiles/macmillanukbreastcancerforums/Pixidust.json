      "Content": "Thanks for all your comments.  I always found it difficult understanding that my biopsy revealed 2 large areas of dcis and very small invasive, and that I should prepare for Chemo.  Then after mastecromy my Consultant said the team decided no further treatment needed as no invasive found in rest of Breast - that they got it out with the biopsy! At the time I was so relieved to not have chemo that I just accepted it.  But now 4 months on, I hAve 2 small lumps that ultra sound is I conclusive - cancer or fatty tissue.  Now I am panicking and doubting the pathology findings.  I thought it would help if I saw the report in details.  I know the basics of my report, to be honest I'm not sure what I am looking for! Just have a lot of doubt going on in my head.  They have said I should wait til August to look at these lumps again as they are too small to biopsy so close to my impant (3mm and 5mm).  I have no idea why my lump feels to obvious to me if its so small! Sorry for the ramble - I am very worried though and feel a bit helpless waiting til August - so thought looking at pathology report would make me feel proactive. X",

      "Content": "Crystaljuju - that did make me chuckle lol.  Yes I agree a lot of the information would be lost on anyone not in the medical field. i have received all my correspondence that is sent to my GP and that is very helpful to keep hold of.  I am looking for reassurance - to know who the patholagist was and experience etc.  I researched my surgeon and it gave me confidence! And yet I know nothing about the person who has made the diagnosis!  Next time I speak with BCN I may ask just for this info and not necessarily all the report.  I can also ask her if it's too late to get a 2nd opinion on pathology side of things.  X",

      "Content": "I called the BCN and they said I have to request the report in writing as they don't send this to the GP.  So I have asked for his secretary email and phone number so I can make the request via email to save time.  Sorry but you hear patient information going missing all too often, and I feel better giving my GP a copy to keep and one for myself.  I spoke to the Macmillan nurse and she said its perfectly reasonable for me to request this and that she would happily go through with me or I can go through with my GP.",

      "Content": "Hi all i am new hear so this is my first post! i am 3 weeks post op mastectomy on left side - they found 2 18mm tumours.  All went well and I don't need any further treatment. i am due to have an ultra sound on opposite side on Wednesday as I can feel a small lump (noticed it about 4 weeks ago - had period and still there) My surgeon said he is doing this test to put my mind at rest as mammogram didn't show anything.  I am trying to act like I am not worried to my family as they have been through enough worry but i can feel all the anxiety coming back.  I keep asking for the brca test and keep getting told it's bad luck this happened and unlikely to be generit, but I'm gonna keep pushing. I am 36 (just) and my nan had ovarian cancer.  My mum has been to docs as I have urged her to get ovaries ultra sound and Mamm done - as she was told she has deformed ovaries years ago and they never followed up the test (my mum would never push for anything) but her doctor is sorting it out as of today.  I believe I am ER sensitive and this is less likely to be brca related, but from what I have found out there are some who test positive still! i feel like I have turned a bit obsessive over it all - but I have 2 girls 4 and 6 and I feel I owe it to them to get as much info and testing as poss!  I am a positive person and should be thankful for having no further treatment etc but I can't relax til I know for sure other side is ok!  Sorry for long post - just needed to put it out there somewhere! and breath!
