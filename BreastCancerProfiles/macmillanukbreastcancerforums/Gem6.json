      "Content": "Hi, I'm new to this online community :) I was diagnosed in May with grade 3 breast cancer, aged 28. Since then I've had 3 ops and about to start FEC-T chemo ( possibly next week) then radiotherapy next year then 10 years of hormonal treatment. I wasn't gonna bother with a cold cap during chemo ( even though I love my long hair) because I've heard how uncomfortable and painful it is with little success . However, I've changed my mind as my oncologist has recommended I give it a try. Has anyone else used a cold cap to help prevent hair loss and what was your experience ??? Â ",

      "Content": "Thanks for the advice everyone. I may as well give it a go and see what happens. I've got long thick hair so hoping I won't lose it all. Even if I lose a lot I am quite happy to wear hats and bandanas to cover up the thin-ness. Will see what happens. Good luck everyone with your treatment Gem x",
