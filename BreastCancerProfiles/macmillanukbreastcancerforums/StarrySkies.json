    "Content": "I contacted Bravissimo (I've been a customer for over 20 years) & they were great. They sent me a Freepost label to return them - any bras from anywhere.  Apparently for bras in poor condition they recycle all the hooks & clips wires etc. and for bras in good condition they pass them on to local &/or global charities. It really helped me to know that my now redundant bras were going for a positive cause to help other women. Good luck! ",
