      "Content": "HI there Well it's 2 weeks today since I had my first treatment and it's been a real mixed bag of reactions. I was completely wired for the first 3 days but I think that was due to the steroids. I felt tired but couldn't sleep and then felt nauseous too. I then got really sharp pains in my mastectomy scar and back ache (the nurse said that these were my weak points and so probably why I got it there, but also the injection you get the day after can give you back ache too). Then I was tired but otherwise ok. However yesterday and today I feel fine! I feel like I did before I started chemo. So it's almost like a bad week and few ok days and then I turned a corner. Hopefully this will be the same for you. One thing that I couldn't work out is that after about a week I got the serious munchies. I have tried to eat healthily but that week I couldn't get enough carbs and sugar!! It was like being pregnant again. Glad to say that has passed now though!!! My hair is still here but I think it is the next few weeks that I will start to lose it if it goes.  Keep me posted on how you feel. I was thinking about you yesterday. Ann x",

      "Content": "Hi I have just finished my chemo (yay!) after 3 doses of FEC and 3 doses of T. I had the usual mouth problems and ended up using Caphosol and Corsadyll mouthwash along with Fluconozole and Nystation for oral thrush. I also loss my sense of taste and everything felt like cardboard - which I know is usual. The question is that I am 3 weeks post my last chemo (and so in reality would have been having my next one tomorrow) and for the last week I have had a really bad salty taste in my mouth. To the point it is making me feel really sick. Has anyone else experienced this? Is it maybe because my taste buds have finally come back that I can taste it? Any help or advise would be great.  Thanks Ann",

      "Content": "Ah thanks Carolyn. I hadn't thought about the sugar thing but will give it a go. I normally have such a sweet tooth but strangely haven't haven't fancied anything sweet recently. I did also try and google it but didn't find anything I could really tie down to it as there seemed so many possibilites as yo what it could be! Maybe you will have more luck than me! I've got radiotherapy next and so think that will make me tired too. I'm not having Herceptin though. I must say though I still have loads of side effects still. My feet are still peeling and my legs are so achy and swollen still. I can't walk up the stairs without having to sit down at the top! Chat soon Ann X",

      "Content": "Perfect. Will start my vitamin tablets again tomorrow too as I stopped them during my chemo. I'll also start eating more beans and dairy and cereal etc. I also stopped juicing as I haven't felt like it whilst having chemo and so that may help too. Thanks so much for your help Carolyn. Will let you know how I get on. I do liked the boiled sweets idea too though! Thanks Ann X",
