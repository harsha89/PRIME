      "Content": "Jackiemary and Ronstar Thanks so much for sharing your experiences. I'm due my next and last chemo on Friday, pre chemo assessment and bloods on Wednesday. I don't usually get to see my onc but see a nurse instead. I think I'll ask if I can see Onc this time. I've had lumpectomy and 3 lymph nodes removed. Clear margins and no lymph node involvement. HER positive so herceptin injections and 4 weeks of radiotherapy. I was told that the herceptin is my \"main weapon\" against my breast cancer coming back but had to have chemo to get herceptin. So yes, it is \"Belt and Braces\". Let's hope we all recover from the neuropathy soon! Good luck with your treatment. H. x",

      "Content": "Hi, Thanks so much for all your replies. It's been really helpful. Keep them coming though as any info is greatly appreciated. Karen, thanks for your reply despite being on holiday, hope you're having a lovely time. Trish, did you carry on with your herceptin injections, were you able to have all 18? I've spoken to Head Oncology Nurse on the phone today and she is trying to arrange for me to see my oncologist at my appointment tomorrow. Her view is that they will cancel my last chemo scheduled for Friday and that I will carry on with the herceptin injections and have my planned radiotherapy. I'll let you know how I get on tomorrow. Cheers guys. Hazel.x",

      "Content": "Hi, I've had 3 out of 4 TC chemos. (Docetaxel and Cyclophosphamide). The day before my third chemo I developed neuropathy in my fingers, numbness and loss of sensation and the soles of my feet are very red and sore with numbness and loss of sensation in my toes and balls of my feet. Has anyone else experienced this? If so, was your chemo dose reduced or stopped early? Also, how long did it take to improve? I've been told it may be permanent? Thanks in advance. H.x",
