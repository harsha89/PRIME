      "Content": "HI I have no idea if you ever check this site now, or if my message might bring it all back-I hope not. I am in a similar position and am hoping to find people who chose to not have chemo/radio in the end. I haven't seen the oncologist but the surgeons told me they are recommending both along with tamoxifen. I hate the idea of it all, having always been healthy. I would like to continue by looking at diet and exercise. Thanks for getting back to me if you feel like it.",

      "Content": "HI Thanks for replying. I was told my lymph nodes were clear until they found they weren't during the surgery. I am not suggesting here that anyone else's situation would be similar! I kept trying to find a way to not have the mastectomy but as I had several lumps and both cancerous and pre-cancerous stuff...And now they want to give chemo and radio. Reading about all the side effects I just don't want it-it will be given as preventative, as the cure treatment was the surgery. Medication I think will be preventative enough. ",

      "Content": "hi My situation was similar in that I had surgery and radiotherapy and was offered chemo. In all honesty I do not recall exactly which type of cancer I had because, for me, the less I remembered the easier it would be to move slowly on. Different though because I was the only/first in my family to have had the diagnosis. I opted to not have chemo, and I do not regret this decision. This all happened in the Summer of 2015, In contrast to you, I thought, they've done the surgery, they blasted me with radiowaves, it's gone. I felt like I was protecting myself from more.  My decision came this way: how will I feel going through chemotherapy vs how will I feel if I have another cancer. For my own mental health, I felt and still feel I made the right decision. Maybe imagine, you're not goiing to be offered it afterall: will you be relieved or scared/angry? It's a horrible thing and I wish you the very best with your choices, and of course your health.",
