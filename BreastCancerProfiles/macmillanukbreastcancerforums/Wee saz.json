    "Content": "Hi StormyLovesOdd, I noticed your post.  I don't have cancer bit I do take Sertraline for depression.  Every time I renew my prescription, the GP reminds me of the increased risk of breast cancer with this medication.  I think it's 1 of the things we take to fix something and it knackers something else up. Citalapram upset my stomach and gave me terrible nightmares, I then had to take Omeprazole for my stomach and live with the nightmares for a while longer!! Don't know if this will help you, just a different point of view. Sandra",
