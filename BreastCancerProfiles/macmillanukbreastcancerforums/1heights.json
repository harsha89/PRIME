    "Content": "Hi Bev, I suffered with this after each session of chemo. I used corsodyl the day of chemo and then for the next 5 days. Until my taste came back. I could only eat soup mostly ham and pea for some reason. Also I liked scrambled eggs on there own. Plain steak as well. Hated the taste of everything else but really wanted to eat everything because of the steroids making me feel hungry. Ice creams are easy to eat too. All I would say is find what you can bear to eat and stick to them, I always got angry when I would fancy something only to not be able to eat it because it made me gag. My taste came back after a few days after each chemo and that is what I focused on. Good luck with everything. Steve.",
