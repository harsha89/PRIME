      "Content": "Hi everyone, my fiancee was diagnosed with a 12mm invasive carcinoma last Friday, and I'm confused with what we have been told. She is booked in for pre-op tests Thursday, which the letter says will include x-rays and blood tests. The surgeon told us that she will have a lumpectomy and then radio for 5weeks, then 5 years on Tamoxifen, and have her ovaries \"turned off\". We don't understand why there is no mention of a CT scan, of liver scan, which everyone else sems to have. We also thought that because the tumour has already been diagnosed as Grade III that she would automatically be given chemo, but the surgeon says she will only need that if the primary lymph gland shows positive signs. Is he going on previous experience that a 12mm tumour is unlikely to have spread or is he jumping the gun slightly. We are trying to get our head round everything as she's only 39, already suffers from terrible Crohns desease and we have three young rug rats to worry about. Any info appreciated.    ",

      "Content": "Hi, thanks for all the kind replies, Jo had her lump removed on Tuesday, I took her in at 7-00am for a 10-30am operation, and the darlings at the NHS finally operated at 6-30pm that evening. She stayed in till 10-30 am the next day. We now have to wait until Monday 23rd for the full details. We have a copy of the letter sent to her GP that says, from the ultrasound, they couldn't see any axillary involvement (fingers crossed that is good news), and that the tumour has tested HER2 negative. We're in the final waiting stage now, and we're looking forward to kicking the little sod into touch. GLA JJJJJ",

      "Content": "Thanks again for the replys. Jo was in hospital today for some pre-op checks, and they only did her bloods, said an x-ray wasn't necessary. I guess I'm just a bag of nerves as Mum passed quickly when she had Pancreatic cancer and my dad is now haveing chemo for Prostate Cancer. Jo asked about chemo, and they said she will be offered it whatever the outcome of the sentinal lymph node biopsy. She has decided to kick its ass, and told them to take as much breast as they like, they can have her ovaries and to give her chemo. She is a strong old girl, we've been together 21 years and she's had Crohns for 18 of those, we nearly lost her when we had our third baby 2 years ago, massive haemorrhaging. thanks for letting me sound off.",

      "Content": "Hi, so we are about 9 months since Jo's bc was first found, 14mm IDC HER-,, and she has now found another lump about 5 cms from the previous sod. The registrar couldn't feel it, but BC nurse could so this Friday (the day after her 40th birthday) we are off for mammo and ultrasound again. Are benign lumps common so soon after treatment? She didn't have chemo as the first dose nearly killed her, so its tamox and zoladex so far.",
