      "Content": "Good morning, Wondering if anyone else has found themselves in my position. Had MX in September and SNB showed spread to lymph nodes. Unfortunately I burned my chest 5 days later with a wheat bag ( tip - don't use) and since then have been waiting for the burn to heal. This stopped me having ANC and it looks like I am still some weeks away from chemo. Beginning to feel really fed up. Op was two months ago. I am on Tamoxifen so feel a bit better. I just don't know if this reduces my chances, if I should go back to work or what? I have kept my spirits up since diagnosis but now feel that I can't any longer. Have oncology appointment later -they refused to see me before now, but I still don't feel as if I am moving on. Any tips??",

      "Content": "Hi everyone, I am an avid reader but not good at writing lol but here I am asking for advice. I was diagnosed with Invasive lobular BC in Sept 13 and had mastectomy, chemo, rads, the usual. All has been well until last Sunday when I began to notice some hip pain. Nothing major just a niggle. Today, a week on, my bottom is oddly sore, can't explain it. Hurst to sit on it or even not. Walking is painful and I am now limping and gritting my teeth walking the dogs. I mentioned to doc on weds when had my zoladex injection but am getting worried more and more. Just read up on spinal compression. Don't think it's this but I am beginning to think I have a secondary in my hip. Anyone have any advice?Â ",

      "Content": "Hi everyone I have been reading your posts with interest. I had mx and snb on 17 September and results came back positive for lymph node involvement so ANC on 18 October! Quite philosophical about it all but dreading the pain as I was in a lot of pain after the first op - especially like everyone else under the arm and while the drain was in. So I am feeling better prepared now for the op. Does anyone know if you automatically have chemo if there is node involvement even if it just one? Is ANC like going back to MX?",
