    "Content": "Hi All,  I have been through 2 cycles of EC and in spite of cold cap my thick hair has been reduced to 30% of its original size so I decided to shave  it off and buy a wig.  I went to Trenco this morning but was not able to find something that would suit me.  I found one wig but they don't have my colour (only blond or dark brown) and it cannot be dyed so back to square one.   I look awful and I am desperate to regain some sense normality and feel somewhat closer to myself again.  I still have 8 months worth of treatment so a full head of hair asap would be really helpful and take some of stress and anxiety away. What other places could I try in London? Please help Thank you!",
