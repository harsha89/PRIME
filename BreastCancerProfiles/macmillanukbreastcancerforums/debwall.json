    "Content": "Hi I'm meeting the oncologist today to discuss the hormone therapy I'll be having. I currently have a non-hormone coil, and was under the impression that because it was non-hormone I could continue to use it. However last week my surgeon saidÂ I would need to have it removed because its not suitable for women who have had breast cancer. I'm now really confused. What advise have other people been told? I'll ask the oncologist later but wanted a lay persons view as well, rather than just the medical. I'm 42 and really can't be bothered with condoms after 15 years of marriage!!! xxx",
