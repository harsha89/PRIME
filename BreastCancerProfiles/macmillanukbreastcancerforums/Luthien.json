I'm commuting into London for work in the morning.  Then have a 2 mile walk home to collect the car and a 15 mile journey to the hospital for RT.  So far so good.  Will have 4/20 any minute now.  I'm amusing myself by taking random selfies (I'm trying to get a different colour gown every day) and have got the nurses to take a photo of me with the giant RT machine.  So far, so good.  Feeling very tired today but I think that's due to manic weekend of being at gigs, shopping, meals out and parkrun I hope you're all doing well too xx",

      "Content": "Hello, I too, was diagnosed from my very first screening just 2 weeks after my 50th birthday in Feb 2018.  I got the callback and had mammogram again, US and biopsy and was told it was definitely cancer there and then.  Mine was 6.5 CM but very flat, hence why I hadn't noticed it (felt like such an idiot).   You sound much more organised than I was, I went to all my appointments on my own and ended up waiting for my copy of the letter sent to the GP to remember what was said in most of them!  It's really worth getting someone calm and organised to go with you, who can write down any answers for you.  I had a good friend who wanted to go but she would have been a nightmare as she's quite bossy and emotional and I imagined her demanding second opinions and annoying everyone :)   Think about what you want to ask and write down questions - what is my treatment plan and in what order e.g. surgery, chemo, radiotherapy  (I had to have chemo before surgery due to type)?  When will it start?  What other tests do I need first?  If you need chemo or radio, ask if your hospital provide free parking.  My chemo hospital does but my radio one gives you a discount. Also, once you have a cancer diagnosis you're entitled to free prescriptions, you'll be assigned a Breast Cancer Nurse (who'll probably be at your next appointment if you've not already met her) so ask her for the form. Top tips - take everything one step at a time.  Just think about the next appointment or next bit of treatment and get all the information you need for that.  You'll be bombarded with information that'll make it seem quite scary.  I found the massive lists of chemo side affects really daunting but you'd be jolly unlucky to get all or even most of them -  be honest with your health care team - don't \"battle through\" - if you're in pain, feel sick, etc tell them and they'll prescribe you meds to help.  Take all the help you need from your healthcare team and from your friends and family and everyone here. I'd also really recommend this book (it's just been released and I wish it'd been around when I was diagnosed.  The Complete Guide to Breast Cancer: How To Feel Empowered and Take Control.  It's written by two doctors who've also both had breast cancer. Best wishes!",

I'm sure someone who has been in your shoes will come along soon with their thoughts. Best wishes for the remainder of your treatment (whichever path you choose)",

I turned 50 at the end of last month and got my first routine mammogram through.  I was recalled and had that second appointment today - just assumed it was a dodgy picture as I don't have any symptoms.  Anyway, had another (very squashy) mammogram on right boob and then called in to see doctor, who very matter-of-factly told my that it was cancer!  Did ultrasound and took biopsies from boob and axy-something (armpit).  Bandaged me up and sent me off with a letter to come back to see consultant on 27th. I'm a bit stunned - I've literally just resigned from my job of 31 years and signed a contract for a new job this Monday which I start next Monday.  My husband is currently out of contact in Asia until I collect him from the airport on Saturday (and knows nothing about this).  I'm currently consoling myself with a Pimms! I think I'm more annoyed at the timing than the diagnosis.  Sorry for the rant. Can someone tell me what to expect at the consultant appointment - good questions to ask etc. Thanks in advance x",

      "Content": "Hi, OK - so this post is just going to be a bit of a download (sorry).  I'm not sure what I'm hoping for in response except someone with a magic wand to make this nightmare go away! So - last month I went for my first routine screening as was just about to turn 50.  Got a recall and told I had breast cancer (shocked as no symptoms).  The biopsy showed invasive duct cancer, 50mm tumour P3 but the node was clear - hurrah!  Packed off for a CT scan and bone scan.  HER2+ mildly ER+, PR-.  I have my first round of FECT on the 16th and sailed through it - all good (was a bit nauseous on the night of chemo and was out and about from the day after)! Last week, I got the results and although the bone scan was clear, the surgeon said there were spots on my lung which they weren't worried about as looked like old infection and a spot on my hip which they didn't know what it was but would send me for a PET scan.  I looked a bit confused and she gave me a thumbs up and said it's good news.  I went off thinking hurrah! Today, I saw my oncologist and asked her why I was having a PET scan if there was nothing to worry about.  She showed me my CT scan and not only was there a spot on my hip, there were lots of small ones in my pelvis.  She said it was strange that they didn't show on the bone scan but she can't rule out that they are not cancer but equally, might just be the way I'm made.   Having not even known I had any sort of cancer 5 weeks ago and sort of having been told that it's just in the breast - I'm REALLY struggling to cope with this.  I know it's stupid as it might not be bone mets but I just feel like I've been kicked from pillar to post by this bloody disease in this short time.  ARGGGHHHHH!! Sorry - that really was a download,  it all seems out of control",
