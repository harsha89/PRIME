      "Content": "Hi Shirls I'm in a similar boat to you - 2 lots of surgery for the exact same reason, my last surgery was on 6th October.  I am Triple Negative, grade 3, clear lymph nodes, so Chemo and Rads are to follow but not seeing oncologist until 11th November.  Chemo is to make sure there's nothing floating around in my system after the surgery, and also, because I'm triple negative, chemo's my only option - Herceptin and Hormone blocking treatment won't be of any use.  I'm very nervous about it, but to be honest I've accepted it's going to happen and just want to get on with it now - I've already bought loads of snazzy head scarves and hats, and last Friday, I had my long hair cut really short which wasn't as taumatic as I thought it would be. Good luck with it all - let us know how you get on x",

      "Content": "Hello! My WLE was last September, followed by 6 x FEC and 20 x Rads, the last rad was 6th May.  I saw my oncologist the following week, and she said she was now releasing me onto the \"open access\" thingy, which basically meant that they did not need to see me again unless I had any concerns, and I would now be put into the Annual screening programme.  I am Triple Neg, so no further treatments available such as Herceptin or Hormone therapy.  I actually asked her the question of what stage am I at now, for the purpose of, for example, travel insurance and such like, am I \"All Clear\"? and she replied \"Basically, yes, all clear.\" But unless I had asked, I doubt she would have actually said those words. I would imagine you would be considered \"All Clear\" once your treatment finished completely. Not sure if this helps or not - maybe when you see your onco next you could ask the question directly, as I did?",

      "Content": "Hi Janey I'm due my 3rd FEC this Friday.  I opted not to go with the cold cap - I hate the cold!  So I can't comment on that but my hair started falling out on day 18 of the first round - not loads but about 15 strands would come out when I rand my fingers through it.  Then on the day of the second lot, it really started to come out in handfuls, so the next day my hairdresser buzzed it all off to a number 4 for me.  It continued to come out over the next few days, short hairs were everywhere, so I had to wear a bandana indoors to try and stop the mess!  And I could \"Pick it out like flowers\" too!  Then it just stopped and no more has fallen out since.  I'm very thin and patchy but I do have some hair left, and not all body hair has gone either.  Will have to wait and see if any more falls out after Friday. I do like my scarves though - they are comfy and warm - I have loads and pick a different colour every day according to my outfit - I've only worn my wig once - on New Year's Eve!",

      "Content": "Hi everyone, hope you are all OK x I have recently finished all my treatment (WLE, SNB, 6 x FEC, 20 x Rads).  For the past few weeks I've been experiencing numbness & pins & needles in my right arm (Not my surgery side but the arm that had Picc line in) only at night though.  Also, when I grip something small, like a make-up brush or pen, my hand goes numb again.  I mentioned it to my Onco last week, but she never expressed any concern and just said to keep an eye on it. For the last few nights it's also been very painful, waking me up and keeping me awake - if I get up and shake my arm a bit, the pain goes but returns the moment I lay back down again - I was awake for most of the night last night!   Also got that feeling in my elbow, like my funny bone's been hit, but permanently!  Anyone else experienced anything similar? ",

My bloods were a bit low last time and had to have them re-done the morning of chemo.  They also prescribed me Emend as I had a bad time sickness wise on FEC3 (Emend is absolutely brilliant, such a shame it's not prescribed from day 1 to everyone) They couldn't start chemo until an hour after I'd taken the Emend, and I couldn't take the Emend until the blood results came back good enough so all in all I ended up being there for 6 hours!  Hoping for good bloods this time. Can't wait for it all to end, but we're nearly there - take care, will be thinking of you on Thursday xx",
