      "Content": "Ive just about recovered from a delayed reconstruction back on 10 January. Again radiotherapy played a part in why it was delayed. I had an implant for two years which grew hard and very uncomfortable. Im loving my new look and am glad I delayed. Unfirtunately ive just been diognosed with secondary breast cancer in lymphatic system. More fighting awaits. Hope all goes well for you",
