I don't know if you are going to need chemo, but certainly if you are going to receive iv treatment they should for you with a Hickman line or a port so your arms are not at risk.  I had bilateral BC and axillary clearance 8 1/2 years ago, and like you cannot have trauma to my arms. During a recent encounter with bowel cancer however I had to have blood taken form the arms and drips in my arms and was OK, but in the end they fitted a Hickman line , which was much better. I asked to be fitted with compression sleeves for my arms and wore them whenever they had been at me with needles, and felt this protected me from lympjoedema. Could you talk to your BC nurse about this! You should not have to suffer in this way. Good luck and hugs xxxxxx",

Well done coming through all that xx I had BC in both breasts 9 years ago, with mastectomy one side, lumpectomy on the other, bilateral axillary clearance, chemo and radiotherapy., followed by letrozole. In remission thankfully at present. In 2017 I was diagnosed with bowel cancer, T3N0M0 at the recto sigmoid junction. I had surgery with no bag, and chemo. My recovery was hampered by 6 attacks of small bowel obstruction ( 3 Hosp admissions with one operation to remove adhesions) the last admission Nov 2018, thankfully settled. In remission at present, 2 year follow up investigations starting next week eeeek!  I feel very lucky to be in remission so far, but it has knocked the stuffing out of me I must confess. Reading on the forum there are some people who have had 3 or more primaries, and others who are living with incurable cancer so I feel I must be positive and not complain. Please keep posting on here. You will find wonderful friends who are a,ways here to support you. Good luck xxx",

He has been the patient since his accident, and he cannot cope with his carer becoming vulnerable and needing care. On top of this he is probably terrified of losing you. The only way he can cope is by pretending life is still normal. He could do with some help as has been suggested, but he is not going to accept it in his present state. I think, again as has been suggested, that your daughters could help here by talking to him. It won't be easy, but when confronted with the reality of things hopefully he will begin to accept what is real now. You sound so positive and upbeat in your profile. Good luck and big hugs xxxxx",

      "Content": "Hi Jacmatholmad, I have been very lucky and have managed to avoid lymphoedma so far. I wear my sleeves irregularly depending on risk. I wore themconstantlywhile in hosp for thebowel ca, and onandoff recently having cannulas etc, but may not need them for months.  I use insect repellant all the. time in summer on myarms. If i cut mysels on arms or hands I use alc gel and then Newskin to seal it. Ihave been able to go to the gym and use weights with no problem. I think it gets the muscle pump working and is good for you. Went swimming too, though have not been for 18/12 due to recent  illness. Looking forward to. restarting soon. I would not be without my sleeve, and am sure they are worth using. Best wishes xx",

      "Content": "Hi Puzzler, you are NOT being silly at all. Lymphoedema is horrible and the prospect of it is frightening. Also it is NOT your fault that your hand is puffy, it is the fault of this horrible disease we have all had to deal with. Life is for living, not full of restrictions. You just have to be a bit careful, and you will get to know how your tissues feel and how to manage it. Swimming is the best possible exercise, and gym activity is fine as long as you are sensible and don't go at it like a bull at a gate.  Wear the sleeve and glove as much as you are able, and it should start to go down. Take great care if any scratches, bites,etc, and you won't get cellulitis. Pruning etc can be a bit dodgy because of thorns and higher risk of skin traumas, but you could use thick gloves. Personally I avoid anything like that.  I had breast lymphiedema for quite a while, but was not prescribed anything for it, just needed a bigger size, and it does not trouble me now. You might find it useful to join the Lymphiedema Support Network. Loads of good advice, peoples' stories, and a regular newsletter. Full of poeple living life to the full, and dealing with the problem. You can google it. I have found on my journey that some nurses have treated my like a recalcitrant 3 year old,mint helpful!! I'm not suggesting ignoring good advice, but some if it is a bit over the top. Good luck, your happy life is not over, just needs a few adjustments. Hugs, Seaspirit xxxx",

      "Content": "Hi Jacmatholmad, I asked for cpmpression sleeves after surgery as I was so scared of getting lymphoedema. I\u2019m ao glad I did. I went to Australia fairly soon after treatment, and wore them on the flight, abd allthe time when I got there. It was so hot and yhe insects were nasty biters. I swam in them and let them dry on me. I had tumours and axillary clearance both sides. Since then I have worn them in hot weather, if I get an insect bite, and if I have ti have blood taken, a cannula, or a drip. Very scary this, but I have no spare arm, and they had difficulty with foot veins. I was really glad to have them when I had 2 major ops last yesr for biwel ca. Bith arms/hands swelled up postop. I really freaked out, but it is a common postop phenomenon. I. wore sleeves and gloves and the swelling reduced. I have found very little understanding among medics outside the breast team, and have had to be very assertive. You are absolutely right to use your sleeve prophylactically. It will pritect you in the future. Good luck and higs, Seaspitut xx",

      "Content": "Violetsniff, my reply went into cyberspace! Here goes again. There are various genetic tests for various cancers, but a lot is still unknown. The only one for BC is the BRCA, and that is only done if you answer certain criteria in family history. There are others on here with more detailed knowledge of such things. There is one for bowel ca, which I had done and was negative.( lynch syndrome) and MSI to see if I would respond to chemo. Don't know much about the others.  My mum died of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, unusual in older people. Her sister had Hodgins lymphoma, and their cousin BC. Their mother, my grandma ha bowel cancer. They all died. I think environments factors also play a large part, as someone else has said, sorry can't remember who. It seems to be more common all round sadly, and in younger people. Though I did see a young girl of 23 dying of rectal when I was training. Treatment is improving all the time, and we are the evidence. Take care of yourselves everyone going through all this horrible stuff Big hugs from me xxxx hope you get this,",

I was exposed to the effects of understaffing in my various admissions last year and I was truly shocked at the extent of the problem.  I was very well looked after by the team despite this, and am fortunate to have a very good outcome.  I just do not know how they keep going. I thought it was bad enough when I was working , but so much worse now. What can we do, feel helpless. The NHS is still wonderful, but we are going to lose it.

I have very flat feet and have to wear insoles, and I think they are going saggy and not working as well. Since the Letrozole it doesn't take, much to set them off. Using my spare pair now and hoping for the best. If no good will have to go back to very expensive, but good Podiatrist. I think I have been doing what Gbear did with her ankle, or was it Eddiboy, sorry, having a post chemo brain fog today.if I don't walk I go crazy. Enough rambling, sorry, it was a lovely walk.

Gorgeous sunshine and walked all round then along the Mersey, with frequent stops for cuppas. It feels so good to be back ther, such a long time since I have been. DH is seeing his daughter and grandchildren, first time for 18/12. I'm not fit for long journey yet. He is also having a great time. 'Normal' seems a bit nearer now! Xxxxxxx",

A woman I was trying to help,called me a bag lady. I have all my stuff in3 well balanced bags because of arthritis in the spine. I just looked at her. She thought she was ever so funny.

Then decided no for 2reasons, first I had ha enough of surgery, second what if it recurred under the reconstruction and I was not aware. I did go on to have a lump,in my mastectomy scar, but thank goodness it was just fat necrosis from the rads. I was also,concerned about poor healing after reconstruction following the rads. I wanted the rads to give me a better chance of no local recurrence. I have managed very well with breast prostheses, and don't care if anyone sees my scar. Good luck xxxx",

I am very lucky to,have a specialist lingerie shop nearby, and they measured me for pocketed bras and provided a special silicon boob. I was too sore to wear at first, but it was very comfortable later on. I was greatly helped by my lovely husband, who when I showed him the scar, said'it's still you' bless him. I later got a swimming boob from Amoena online. It is tougher silicon and cheaper, and in the end I wear swimming boobs all the time. The others are fragile and very very expensive. I get my bras form Amoena too. Nice bright colours, avoiding the dreaded beige. Get bikinis and tanking a from them too. If you get the size wrong you can exchange. I had radiotherapy on the mastectomy side and was a bit worried about healing as the skin can be fragile. I was relieved I was unconstructed when the lump appeared, how would Imhave know with an implant in place? I had left mastectomy and right lumpectomy with axillary clearance both sides. Having 2 arms at risk of lymphoedema is a problem, but I use insect repellant and got measured for sleeves which I use if I get bites or it is very hot, and if I have to have drips etc, been OK so far. Finally, don't know if you will need chemo, but if you do and lose your hair the best thing is to shave your head when the hair starts to fall out, less upsetting. I bought 13 cheap wigs from eBay and wore a different one each week at the hospital. They all came to see which one I had on, I used toupee tape to stick them on, bought online from CaptainHair. My worst fear was it blowing off in public! Anything else you want to know l,ease let me know. Big hugs xxxx",

At Verona everyone lights candles just before the performance starts, wonderful effect. At Torre del Largo yiu can go on the lake during the day and the boat plays opera over the loudspeakers. You can also go round Puccini's house. Very happy times xxxx",

I am soooo weary of having to chase EVERYTHING up!!!!! Rant over. Our plans for house extension are going well. No planning permission needed, just an 8 week wait to get cert from council, then we can start getting builders' quotes. Lots of clearing up to do first ️️️,started today getting rid of XS duvets sleeping bags and pillows. There is a local charity which distributes to the homeless in Manchester. Nice to know they will be appreciated. Tai chi last night was great.  Exhausted now, hope will sleep. Hope you are not overdoing it, and that you are OK while OH is away xxxxx",

      "Content": "Hi Yellowroses, glad you are walking 2.5 miles, even though you had to rest, well done. For me the side effects started almost straight away. Lots of aching and muscle pain, fatigue, poor sleep, depression and anxiety. I have learned to manage this over the years and it has not stopped me doing anything. I still get up from a chair like an old woman, but it wears off. I walk as much as I like, sing, do Tai Chi, and will be swimming again soon(recovering from chemo for bowel.ca) I have to take an afternoon nap. Without that I cannot get through the day. I have counselling for the depression, and use mindfulness hypnotherapy and homeopathy.  I feel safe and protected by the Letrozole, and am happier staying on it, and so far it has worked for me. Here is one other side effect, osteoporosis, and your consultant will keep checks on that with dexa scans. Walking is a great help in preventing that. Good luck, and keep walking! Hugs xxxx",

They are tougher then the others, and cheaper,and I ended up getting 2, one for normal. I keep the swimming boob in the bikini bra, easier to manage changing.  With the apartment being by the sea I can risk being in the sun for a short time. Has been too hot for me to stay in it for long, now cooler. I have been on a nudist beach with my mastectomy scar and was totally accepted with no funny looks or remarks. Lovely people. I am glad I did not go for reconstruction.it was taken out of my hands really because I had to have other surgery and decided enough was enough, It was not offered at the time of mastectomy, but I worried in case if recurrence in the scar of which I would be unaware. I did get a lump in the scar but thank goodness it was just fat necrosis. Good luck with your decision, and I hope they get a move on with your op. Big hugs xx.  ",

The girl spoke to me as if I were a common criminal and I was just about to go off on one, and my lovely friend just said to her 'she's not well, just do it!' They can find you on the computer quite easily. (We had never opened the envelope containing the new cards s it was lost in the pile of post after out hols in July. )We did get a walk then but had to cut it short because of the time. Enjoyed Tai Chi that night, always makes me feel good. Then a lovely swim in the rain today, had the pool to myself. I want there too early for the half term crowds.",

Never seen one before.  The cafe was shut, so we found a Cafe  Nero in Sale and just chilled with 2 large mugs is tea each.

      "Content": "We had a lovely quiet day today, short local walk this morning, than had roast duck. FaceTimed respective families and binge watched ER. Very self indulgent  The supposedly fixed dishwasher croaked again on Sunday, and DH had to go to Curry's to get a new one, plumbed it in and the inlet tap broke and there was a flood. The cupboard under the sink has never been so clean!!! The new one works beat but I cannot get the hang of the electronic controls! Then today the same marauding cat nearly got a great tit in front of my eyes. It did a spectacular leap up to the feeder and just missed. I sent it off again. I'm on watch now, Was a lovely day, and we are just chilling out tomorrow.again. Been very hectic and we need to.  Xxx",

No cormorants, but the boats were out racing.  Swimming tomorrow, and then I am singing In 2 concerts next week, so will have to rest up during the day. Have. Good week everyone xxxxx",

      "Content": "moomy, sorry you have ANOTHER cold!  We have been getting new lights for hall landing and 2 bedrooms. We agreed fairly quickly (!) ( B and Q) hall landing and one bedroom fitted. Light nearer to daylight which helps the winter glooms. Last one awaited as yet, managing on a powerful portable big torch. More fees paid for more plans, now await building regs approval for our extension. Dreading having builders, but it can't come soon enough. Downstairs loo is essential now (bad knee arthritis plus frequent urgent loo visits--not a good combination). and a bigger kitchen. Ours is so small it is a wonder we have not killed each other trying to manoeuvre in such a small area. Plus more living room space.  Mozart's requiem a delight to sing, but our MD is driving me crazy with her teaching methods. Having to listen to a recording with very faint accompaniment, with your part very loud ugh. Unfortunately we altos were expected to sing to the loud soprano track. Really unpleasant. In addition there was a huge amount of faff over which edition we were singing on some movements. We, she and our accompanist had different ones---chaos city !!!!! Still love the music though. Enough, you are saying, night night xxxxx",

      "Content": "HI Sunnyone, it is a family joke, but started during my chemo for BC when walks had to be flat! It started again with my treatment for bowel cancer, but I'm improving now and can do hills. I must say though that the hills in Whitby nearly finished me off when I was 2 months post bowel cancer chemo! I say it  as an encouragement to everyone who feels crap during treatment, because I found walking, even 1day postop was hugely beneficial for my recovery, as yiu have done. It is an awesome thread!

Glad you are all enjoying the outdoors, even the inside of a bombe!  Amalie, I had a fab holiday on Croatia a few years ago. Still swimming here in Portscatho. In before breakfast, and then a tea and croissant in the cafe in my bikini, in the sun, bliss.  Weather changed at lunchtime, wind rain and big waves, went down to the sea but just paddled, bit too dangerous for swimming. Enjoyed jumping around, getting wet, and being daft.  Crashed out afterwards!!  Hugs to all xx. ",

How were you invited, and when is it, and do post pics if you are allowed to take them. I have attended two when in my early thirties.  One at Buckingham Palace and one locally when the Queen visited Manchester.  Invited because first husband was a local councillor. Really enjoyed them, saw Queen and Prince Philip from about 10 yards but did not actually meet them.  The funniest part was actually going through the gates of the palace grounds as people lining the path thought we were celebrities!! Wore a big hat; agree with you, don't like fascinators. Hope you are well enough really to enjoy it xxxxx",

Felt am at last getting back to some semblance of normal. Am starting my new Tai Chi class on Thurs night. It is just down the road from me, so much easier to get to than Maggies. Friday is our third wedding anniversary, can't believe how quickly the time has gone. Instead of going out in the evening, we are going for lunch in a posh restaurant (in our hiking boots) and then going walking round Hollingworth Lake. We then return to said restaurant and have tea and cake. It will be the first time there since November too .Love to all xxxx",

The gynaecologist agreed with all of them that systemic absorption is minimal. They all said that quality is life is very important. I have been using it for 8 years now. I use masses of olive oil too, which also helps and I Know I can not be allergic to that! Good luck and be assertive,it's too important to be ignored by the medics and nurses. Xxxxx",

Fingers crossed I\u2019m OK now, but I\u2019m being very careful.  I firmly belive local oestrogen cream has a very good protective effect, and it is quite safe with hormone + BC. Hugs xxx",

You will see from my profile what has gone on for me, and it hasn't been easy, but age has not been a factor at all. I have had meltdowns, nightmares, terrible anxiety, but with the help of my wonderful DH, family and friends have dealt with it. I have also had counselling, used mindfulness, hypnotherapy, and homeopathy. I have also done as much exercise as I am able which also helps. You do not say if you have family around. It is always more difficult it you are dealing with this alone, but you can always come on this forum and find great support from a lot of lovely people. There are also Macmillan enters, Maggies and the helpline. You are not alone, everyone understands what you are going through and we are all here for you. Big hugs xxx X",

      "Content": "Misty Blue, so sorry to read of the horrendously uncaring way you have been treated. The hospice should be seeing you regularly. The GP is obliged to,flag you on the system as an incurable cancer patient , and you should have regular reviews and priority if you need more urgent care. They are supposed to,have meetings with nurses etc where they discuss patients like you and your ongoing care. Disgraceful.Have yiu anyone who can advocate for you and get you the help,you need.? On your present state ,mthough bfave with a tremendous spirit, yiu are in too much of a vulnerable place to be effective against all the blocks, indifference , and put offs. I do admire you for,carrying on writing and getting your books published, despite all this. Writing is probably the best therapy for you at present! Good luck, and sending you big hugs  xxx",

      "Content": "So sorry Earwig o that has happened. Very upsetting. Is it because of bed shortages? It should not happen to cancer patients, they should be top priority. Having said that I must reassure you that 2 weeks will make no difference to your prognosis. The psychological trauma, however, is huge. My big op for bowel cancer was cancelled as I was waiting to go to theatre last April, for lack of HDU beds, and I had to wait 3 weeks. It was just awful. I was terrified I would get a cold, or the bed situation would occur again. It wasn't and I didn't and all was well  When I had to have emergency surgery later in the summer they guaranteed that it would go ahead, and said they would keep me in recovery if necessary!  The care was excellent, and I like to think I had dodged a bullet by missing the original,date. Big hugs to you from me, you poor thing, and fingers crossed it will all go ahead successfully on June 12th xxxxxxx",

So irritating! Nothing you can do, just hope,it improves with time. Seems trivial, but I hate having makeup like a panda! On the long term clearing the tear ducts may help, but I think it is probably the chemo. Xxxxx",

He might be very angry with you, but he may listen to someone else. I persuaded my husband to see the dr when he had a very bad cough, and just asked him to tell the dr how he was feeling. He accepted the drs advice thank goodness.  It is very hard to live with when you are suffering so much yourself.  You need someone to talk to as well! Good luck and lots of love xx",

Also is there a Macmillan centre near you where you could go for counselling, reflexology, and other complementary therapies? Like you I had bilateral breast cancer, 3 tumours in all. This was 8 years ago. I had mastectomy one side, lumpectomy on the other, and axillary clearance both sides, followed by chemo and radiotherapy both sides. I have come through it all and am thankfully in remission.  I became very depressed about 18 months after treatment finished.  I found counselling and complementary treatments very helpful. Now I have bowel cancer, postop and on chemo, and doing OK. It does get better. Lots of love, Seaspirit x",
