      "Content": "Hi, I can definitely recommend these Sainsbury's crop tops.  I wore them after my mastectomy and upper lung Lobectomy last year.. Sainsbury's do some that have a double material layer in the cup and have thin padded cups in.  I took out the padded cups , cut a slit in the inner layer of the material in the cup and put my own \"softie\" prothesis in.  They are so comfortable and all my scars healed really well.  I wore them for two months and then found I was able to wear the bras I had bought.  I look forward to putting them on when I get home from work too and at weekends.   I hope you feel more comfortable soon.",
