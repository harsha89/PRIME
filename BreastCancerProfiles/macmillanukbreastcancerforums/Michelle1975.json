      "Content": "Hi all, I was called in yesterday for a partial result of mammogram, scan and biopsy. My Dr said he is 95% sure I have cancer and will confirm next week, he thinks it is early stage and will remove some of my breast and lymph nodes to check if it's spread, the initial ultrasound didn't pick any up.  One minute I'm fine but next I have mini melt downs and of course all the bad stuff goes round in my head, what if it has spread, what if this is a secondary site ( I don't even know if that is possible ) , I'm hoping all this is normal.  How long from diagnosis is it usually until treatment is started?  I feel I have a million questions but don't know how or where to start xxx ",
