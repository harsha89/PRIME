      "Content": "Hi  Thanks for taking time to post reply, I have been feeling better but the area around the drain site was red so called BC nurse.  She arranged for me to go and see her at hospital she had a look and said no infection and cleaned wound and changed dressing. Have appointment with Consultant on Tuesday to get result of pathology so fingers and toes crossed for good results.  Told to keep on dressing until then. Glad I contacted the nurse as now peace of mind, think shivers were body reacting to all the trauma and drugs have stopped taking the codeine phosphate just taking paracetamol and ibuprofen feeling better on those. Thanks again for your concern and advice. C x",

      "Content": "Hi I had a mastectomy 5 days ago and spent only one overnight stay in hospital, it was not as bad as I had expected, had shoulder surgery last year and was in agony and restricted movement so was expecting something similar.   Taken painkillers prescribed by hospital and appreciate that\u2019s what\u2019s probably keeping pain at bay. However today I feel as though I have just hit the wall extremely fatigued and feeling cold and shivery. Went to hospital this afternoon and got drain removed so that is a plus.  Nurse said slight discharge from drain site but after check from Dr this was just covered with a dressing. Is it normal to feel so shattered five days after surgery also cold and shivery concerned that it maybe an infection but might be overthinking as surely Nurse would have noticed. Anyway thinking of dropping the codeine as think this is making me so sleepy. Interested to hear how others felt after surgery as it\u2019s all new to me. Cx",

      "Content": "Thank you all for your helpful posts. Had a reasonable sleep went to bed for first time since surgery as drain was taken out and this helped.  Hubby was great kept checking to see I didn\u2019t have a temperature.  No redness around the drain site before I went to bed so happy that it was probably not infection. Today still tired but not anywhere like how I felt yesterday and not shivery think it was probably just everything catching up with me. Thanks again to all who replied good to have views of others who have experienced the pain and emotions. Take care everyone and bug hugs to you all❤️ ",

      "Content": "My name is Alison I had a mastectomy a year ago, I felt I recovered quite quickly and went back to work in two months, I was lucky in that I only had DCI's and not full blown cancer. I had a back flat but looking back wish I had just gone for the implants only option. I have implants as well as a massive scar on my back which I was told today and which I already knew wouldn't get any better, It is very red and protruding, it looks very ugly. When I was first told I would need the operation I looked everything up on the internet as none of my friends had been in the same position as me so I had no one I knew to talk to. My first choice and gut feeling was to go with just the implants but was talked into the back flap by the nurse at the hospital. BIG MIstake for me anyway, I now have red scare tissue across my back and a big red diamond scare on the breast. I would like anyone with the same problem to contact me if they know of any way or have had any tattooing done to cover the scars.",
