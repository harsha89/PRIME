I definitely needed support for the first few days especially as I went home with a drain in. As to going back to work, I didn't because I felt I couldn't cope with the responsibility and long days but I suppose it depends what you do. My doctor has signed me off for three months initially as I'm now on the chemo roller coaster and actually now expect to be off work for six months before I've finished all my treatment - again I suppose it depends what you do but I know I couldn't do my job and cope with this treatment. If you don't have anyone who can stay with you, you need to talk to your breast nurse or GP to look at giving you support at key times. Please don't try to cope with this alone.",
