      "Content": "Hi Jane I too feel the need to try to control a situation which I have no control and after reading Professor Plant's book have decided like you to try to cut out dairy completely and only eat eggs and fish occasionally and just organic chicken.  I am already taking Adcal D3 calcium tablets each day so feel switching to soya or almond milk should be fine.   Chrissycc",

      "Content": "Hi, I thought I would share this with you as not too sure what to make of it. I was given an article from a newspaper about dairy foods hindering the survival of women with breast cancer.  It said US scientists suspect that because milk and other dairy foods contain the hormone oestrogen, which encourages tumour growth, this could hinder the survival of women with breast cancer.   They point out that most milk consumed in Britain and the US comes from pregnant cows and is rich in oestrogen. After reading this I found a book called Your Life in your Hands on the internet written by Professor Jane Plant, herself a scientist who had been given 5 months to live after her cancer returned for the 5th time.  She decided to look into the facts that showed a background rate of breast cancer of 1 in 100,000 women in China compared to a rate of one in ten in much of the West; she checked that the information was correct with senior academics that she knew well in China and also with some Chinese doctors who told her that they had hardly seen a case of breast cancer in their careers. This was because they rarely consumed dairy products. Should be glad of your comments on this. Chrissyxcc",

      "Content": "Hi, I was on 1 mg Anastrazole for over a year and like you feeling very tired and achy and my wrist joints were excruciatingly painful even when  picking up a cup and saucer, I mentioned it to my doctor who virtually told me I had to grin and bear it as it was one of the side effects.  When I next saw my oncologist I mentioned it again as it seemed to be getting worse and she said she would write to my doctor to prescribe Exemestane as it was more gentle on the joints (and more expensive, I wonder if this was why it wasn't mentioned when I asked my doc).  I have been on  25 mg Exemestane for over a year now and the pain in my wrists have gone and I am feeling so much better.  I also take Adcal D3  1500mg calcium tablets.  I had a R mastectomy 2011, chemo and radiotherapy and my C was grade 1 and 2 invasive. I am 67 years young, I still have bouts of tiredness, but normally very active, gardening, walking the dog and playing table tennis with my wonderful grandchildren. Hope this helps. Chrissycc",
