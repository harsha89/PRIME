    "Content": "Hi, I had a lumpectomy 15th jan. My shoulder is still sore. Like you, I felt better at first. My hand gets pins and needles but I can get rid of this by wriggling my fingers. My BCN says that his is normal and that some nerves are damaged with lymph node removal. Pain can come as the nerves mend. I get pain in my shoulder blade and under my arm. I still have a numb armpit. I only had one centinal node removed. Hope it helps and good luck, xx",
