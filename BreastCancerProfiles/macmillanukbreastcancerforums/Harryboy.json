I'm scrolling through trying to find anything that relates to my mums experience.  She has had chemo, surgery, rads and now has 7 herceptin injections remaining. She has been troubled at times during chemo with diarrhoea, and is still troubled now.  She has been referred for a colonoscopy.  Im wondering what your experience/thoughts are. Any advice is appreciated. thanks in advance Susan",

      "Content": "Hi there, I hope everyone has had as nice a weekend as possible.   I am hoping for some advice/thoughts on my mums situation.  She was diagnosed with her2 positive breast cancer in October 2015 and has since come through chemo, surgery and radiotherapy.  She has been receiving herceptin injection every 3 weeks.  This was administered on the same day as chemo until that ended, and is now administered on its own.  When going through chemo, she experienced periods of diarrhoea which was apparently a common side effect.  This was controlled by Imodium.  However, she has continued to experience diarrhoea on a daily basis since chemo ended.  This has come and gone, usually once a day, but in the last few weeks it has flared up again.  She discussed this will her oncologist and has been advised to continue to take Imodium, and she has now advised that she should have a colonoscopy. Has anyone had any experience of this?  As far as i have read, diarrhoea is listed as a side effect of herceptin.  We are a little concerned though as the oncologist didn't mention it as a side effect.  I appreciate that everything is best to be investigated, but am wondering if anyone else experienced this while receiving herceptin. Thank you in advance for reading this post, and for any advice. Sue",

      "Content": "Thank you for your reply.  Hopefully it is just to make sure everything is ok.  A few years ago she had a bowel issue which resulted in a small section of bowel being removed.  It was not involving cancer.  Again maybe because of this history, best investigate thoroughly.  Automatically we think firstly of cancer, forgetting that there are lots of other possibilities/conditions. Take care, Susan",

Take care, Sue",
