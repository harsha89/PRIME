    "Content": "Hi Marie, My friend has been paying a fortune for years for mastectomy bras and tells me they are plain and not pretty. A couple of months ago she visited Oxford and went into Marks & Spencer she was delighted to find they stock mastectomy bras with matching pants, she treated herself to a couple of sets at a fraction of the price she was paying. Not sure which other branches stock them but worth looking at. Michele X",
