    "Content": "Hi Michele I had a WLE on 17 Dec and then on 20th Jan I had a second WLE (as they needed to get a bit more for margins) with an SNB The surgeries were both \"day case\" but said I couldn't stay on my own the first night, so I stayed with my sister (I would otherwise have had to stay in hospital). I was absolutely fine and went back to my house the next morning. I did give my house a good clean before I went in, and was stocked up on \"healthy\" microwave meals to minimise what I needed to do, but I didn't have any problems at all. I did tire more easily for a few days, but was back in work part time after a week off. I must stress I have a sedentary job and have supportive employers so could come and go as i wanted (it was my choice to go back) I made sure I had plenty of rest, loads of water and fruit/veg, and I think that all helped. I bought a load of cheap white flannels from Tesco, as I could only shower from the waist down for a couple of weeks, and having a big pile of flannels meant that I didn't HAVE to do washing for a week (although I didn't have a problem using the washing machine, just used my \"good\" arm) driving the consultant said to wait a couple of days ad then try an emergency stop whilst parked on the drive. If it didn't hurt at all, I could drive. I was very lucky and was fine. I think it depends where the incision site is. Someone else mentioned about the exercises and completely agree with that. I have stopped doing them in the last month or so, and I have noticed my range of movement has reduced, so have started doing them again (I know, I know, I shouldn't have stopped!) We are absolutely all different and some will find things easier than others. I think you will be absolutely fine :) The people on here are amazing Best of luckÂ  Nicola xxx",
