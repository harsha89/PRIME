My healthcare in my area is a joke but i have an appointment booked again for 3rd June so fingers crossed.",

I had a wire put in by radiologist who said she had never done one for lymph nodes before! and that they were quite deep but to her all looked perfectly normal. My surgeon is really beating himself up about it, he is such a perfectionist. I will have results on 10th of sep(very quick) so keeping fingers crossed I only need radiotherapy. I'm in so much more pain than when they did lumpectomy and original sentinel node biopsy but I suppose with no nodes it was just tissue then.",

How wrong we were, we lost him. We are still going away in July with him in our memory and hearts. After my lumpectomy and radiotherapy, I had the opposite effect to you Galligirl in that I booked a further two holidays for this year! I figure that if I have my check at roughly same time as my diagnosis, I had a year to plan things. Sometimes I do have real lows but i need to keep looking forward to stop myself falling. Only those of us that have been through this can understand. I have real problems with my husband thinking or acting that treatment is over now let's get back to normal. it's impossible to make him understand that I will never be 'normal' again. ",

After my mammogram came back inconclusive I went into freefall with Another mammogram and biopsy, until my diagnosis in July 2018.  All that I was told in that room was..it is cancer, its 11mm, its grade 111. We are looking at Lumpectomy and radiotherapy. I was sent away with a breast cancer care booklet that the BCN had marked with points that applied to me. Invasive breast cancer/invasive ductal breast cancer. Grade 3. Hormone receptor test(my cancer needs oestrogen to grow) HER2 test (I assume mine was negative as I didn't have chemotherapy)  Then an explanation/diagram about the surgery and sentinel node biopsy (mine were clear) radiotherapy was marked with 3 weeks mon-fri also hormone therapy marked tablets after rads 5-10years That's it! Some of the posts I have read have such detail and it's making me wonder if I should have questioned a little more. At the time I was happy to just let the professionals get on with it. I intended to ask more on my followup appointment but if you have seen my posts, my rads finished 16th Nov and I have had 2 cancelled followup appointments. Is it best to know or not to know?

I also need to work as I'm self employed. Your post has given me hope that I can do both.",

I've been reading on hear and wasnt unduly worried as many people find that after rads there are many lumps and bumps. I suppose we all have to get to know our new bodies. But, I am now going to insist on seeing someone re these lumps and get them checked out. I had never found my lump as it had shown on my 1st mammogram.
