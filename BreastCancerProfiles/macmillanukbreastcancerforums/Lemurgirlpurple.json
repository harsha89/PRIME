      "Content": "Hello. I've just finished my chemo and am going for a mastectomy and lymph node clearance in a couple of weeks. I'm also having gall bladder out at same time which I was supposed to have before the cancer diagnosis! I think I'm transferring my worry about the actual op into worry about having the right nightware etc for in hospital so I thought I'd ask if anyone had any tips for what to pack for hospital, or generally to help me prepare! Thanks",

      "Content": "I'm at home on day 5 with one drain still in and touch wood all going ok. They lent me a little long handled bag to carry it round in and I zip it under a fleece so my toddlers can't see or pull on it! Slept on my back at the hospital (had gall bladder out at same time so felt uncomfy on side) but last night managed to sleep on opposite side which was lovely. Ask the nurses to make you comfy as they can prop pillows round you to help. I was very sleepy for couple of days and bit nauseous from anaesthetic but they can give you anti sickness drugs to help. I've kept up the painkillers and so only had the odd twinge which is a relief. I do think it is really imp to do the exercises they recommend 3 times a day as you can tell it loosening the shoulder and armpit. I do them half hour after painkillers so not too painful. And don't be in too much of a rush to get home. Changing a couple of nappies this morning has tired me out! Good luck Wendy. Will be thinking of you.",

      "Content": "It doesn't necessarily get worse as chemo progresses, and I found that knowing I'd be aching the day I finished injections to boost white blood cells but that it was only a day for example made it easier. In fact, when I switched from EC to Docetaxel after 4, I really missed knowing what side effects would happen when! I heard yesterday that the docetaxel is working so well that they might give me an additional 2 doses!! Mixed feelings about that. Great it working but then I'll have had 10 chemos! And if they are cutting the breast off anyway why does it need to be shrunk even more?? Questions questions for oncologist!",

Good to read it didn't for you wig lady! Might be 2 months ahead of regrowth schedule..and well done Jen. I also found the nursery run daunting in my scarves, but at least now the staff help carry one of my twins to the car so there are some advantages!!",

      "Content": "I found I had really achey joints on docetaxel and my yoga teacher told me that toxins accumulate in the sinovial fluid of the joints and so gave me a series of simple exercises to do to help flush them out. When I did these for the last 2 sessions I was a lot less achey, so worth a go. You can prob find the exercises on the internet if you google Pavanmuktasana joint freeing series. It also helped to have something I could do to help. And yes, drink, drink and drink during chemo and for the following days. Might be worth getting a few diff cordials in as I found I went right off apple for instance, but orange was ok, then a day or two later, the opposite was true! Good luck to you and your sister. X",
