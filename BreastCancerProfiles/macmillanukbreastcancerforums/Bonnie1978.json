    "Content": "Hello I am new to the groups, but I need some advice. I had stage 3C hormone positive lobular breast cancer 8 years ago. I am now getting very sore ribs, at the sides but also at the back. I\u2019m petrified that it\u2019s bone cancer and I don\u2019t know what to do. I have also got post mastectomy pain syndrome, so I don\u2019t know if that is connected? Any advice would be very much appreciated!",
