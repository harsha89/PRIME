Re little Missy, I bought some if those training pads for dogs. I actually thought they were pads / nappies and was ready to put them on my two girlies ! Most disappointed when they were just squares of absorbent stuff that you encourage the dogs to use. Good old fashioned newspaper does the same. Your little one will find a \"favourite \" place, put the pads there, let her use it, then move it , not the same one , that would next bit smelly, in stages towards the back door , or wherever she is meant to do her business. That's the theory !!!! With 2 Springer Spaniels , it took about 2 months to be totally poo free!!! I am no Barbara Woodhouse, nearly put Barbara Cartland !!!, but hope that helps Don't overdo it at work. Enjoy . Xxxxx. Sue xxxxX",

I have always had problems with BOTH boobs. Lumpy/sore, fibro adenomas etc etc. 6 months before my diagnosis I had been to the GP telling him I could feel lumps in both boobs. Virtualy told not to be silly...just scar tissue from previous removals (x6). Fast forward 6 mths and two of the lumps I felt turned out to be Invasive Ductal Carcinoma. So.............I make no apologies for being paranoid....and just want it to be one less thing for me to worry about. I am not going to do anything now....waiting until I see the surgeon again in March, when I will have my first annual mamogram. This is when we would be discussing reconstruction. Just getting my ammo ready. Thanks for your help. xx Sue",

And somehow it became something I wanted. They offered me the district nurse, every day for the 5 days they were needed them, but I did not want to have to hang around waiting for her to come , so managed them myself. They really are easy to do, I worked out how to do it without looking !!!! Honest it was that easy . They can show someone else in your family how to do it , I know some otherhalves have done the deed for them. Whoever does it....... It is worth it. I did not get any high temperatures, major infections and stayed out if hospital , other than scheduled appointments. Tell you what. This bootcamp certainly works .... No one would have believed me before all this crap , if I told them what I would put up with!!! But ...... We don't have much choice ... Do we !!! That's not a question . XxxxxX. Sue",

Just be careful , if you feel unwell take your temperature, you need to make sure you don't get an infection. Don't panic if you do though, all can be sorted with antibiotics. Just dont leave it . Some hospitals give you injections to do at home to increase the white blood cells for those days, mine did.and I did not have any infection and I did not get overly tired, well no more than usual whilst on chemo.

Maybe next time wear a shirt you can do up, and when they tell you to strip off , leave that on until the moment you have to reveal all.

It is so aggravating to have to wait but I suppose it is best they chose the most effective solution for you rather than rushing it and then everyone doubting if it was the right choice. Even you must give yourself times to want to to scream , cry and generally feel miserable ...... And then you can pick yourself up , dust yourself down and carry on the fight. I know I need days when I want to be alone so I can give in to being scared/frightened or whatever , without upsetting everyone around me. I have had house guests for 6 weeks solid and whilst I am sure I will miss them, at the moment I am enjoying my own peace ( well as much peace as i can I get with two springer spaniels and 2 cats!) So...... Give yourself permission to be a miserable bugger for x amount of time, then do something you know will lift your spirits, alcoholic or not. Sometimes you need the lows to reach hight highs .... If that makes sense . You are a bouncy type and whatever they chuck at you ..... You will deal with it... We can help you for a change.

The achy legs, hips, and feet were the worse. I then had a sore mouth/throat. Which I left too long before getting help. Once i ahd the meds it got better within a few days.. So 10 days ish of not so good...but then I was and have been fine. Tax 2 not so bad, just getting more tired, which is more to do with the cumulative effect of chemo....seems like lots of people get chemo 5 meltdown... Don't worry about it in advance....it may not be as bad for you....just be prepared and don't hang around if you feel unwell...see your GP they have things for most of the side effects. At least you don't get that sicky feeling on Tax, Make sure you have something for constipation, I have Laxidol. which is quite gentle, think it is the painkillers that bunge you up...Joy of joys !!! Whatever happens remember all this crap is temporary...even the hair loss, and you are kicking the unwanted invader out of your system. It is worth it..... i can say that truthfully now I have finished the bloody chemo....yippppeee. xx Sue xx",

If not there would not be a question. Does that sound like chemo thinking ???  Our surgeons no doubt have said the same to all of us, they are happy they have got it all ....or else we would have been back for a second clearance.  Our Oncologist no doubt have all said something very similar, chemo/rads are the insurance policy, mop up any possible stray cancer cells wherever they may be. For those of us lucky enough to be on Herceptin/Tamoxifen/Arimidex, or whatever the cocktail of the day is ......thats just to try to make sure the little blighter does not come back. So....HAD ...it is for me. For those into self help books/techniques....again the theory is you can help yourself fight against cancer by believing the cancer is gone, boosting your immune system etc etc etc.    So...unless I am in a dark mood....and that happens only sometimes...less now than before.. I HAVE HAD CANCER...... but still having preventative treatment...thats not sitting on the fence....is it ??",

      "Content": "Hi Sassy Hope FEC is being kinder to you now. It is soooo important to flush all the crap out, hard to do when you feel so sick though. Just keep trying different things to tempt you... Lemonade, once the fizz had subsided worked well, as did ginger beer. Ribena and Vimto with lots of ice, gingrs crossed for you. How many FEC are you having ? For me , once I changed one if the anti sickness drugs the side effects were do able. It was realitively quick, I usually felt ok during the day of chemo, then on the first one just felt nauseous . That lasted 2-3 days and then I was ok (ish), just got tired quickly, but recovered well if I rested. I found the anti sickness one they changed made me feel, spaced out. I have never driven with both hands on the wheel,slower than the speed limit .. but was having to do that and concentrate on the road, sitting forward, driving like Mr Magoo ( if you know who he is ... !!!!!) FEC 2 & 3 , I was actually sick on the night of chemo but felt much better once I had been ill. This from someone who has a panic attack , literally, if I am ill. I was then ok after, just the tiredness. ! Obviously lost my hair but after the initial shock that was ok. Doxcetacel 1 affected me worse. Probably going jn to the unknown we part of it and it lulled me into a false sense of security, crafty do and so. Days 1-4 I felt fine... Day 5 and I have not felt so much pain in so many joints .. All at the same time. From my hips down anything that moved hurt. I am not a wimp but Parecetemol and ibuprofen did nog touch it. I got Tramadol from the Dr but it took 2-3 days for the pain to become a dull ache. Then I got a mouth a throat infection. Could not eat and even drinking was painful. Once I got meds from the Dr it took nearly a week to clear up. So about 10 days of misery . Stocked up on all drugs ready for round 2 as I was going on a canal boat trip , booked before all of this horror story called BC,. The good news is number 2 had been much better . Just achy, not pain ... Mouth a bit sore but not infected . Taste buds definitely out of sorts..... Can' t believe I cannot eat chocolate, what is the world coming to !! So the usual pineapple, melon , sorbets , have been all I have wanted I've the past 10 days. A bit awkward when the \" fun\" bit of the canal boat trip was stopping off here and there for lunch/dinner ..... Everyone else stuffing their faces and me trying to be sociable , trying to find something soft, not creamy, can't do creamy things at the moment, and failing miserably which made me more and more miserable over the past week. Only just starting to feel like me.... Now I am back home. I have been very tired, but that could be the Tramadol, which I have taken mainly at night, to make sure I could sleep. I am definitely getting more \"emotional \"and we won't go into relationship with the OH..... I hate the way I look at the moment , my eye lashes and brows are almost none existant , so I now officially look ill and can't stand looking at myself. Short term I know but horrible . Still can't change if so ... Let's just get over it . But the best news is ONLY 1 more to go , roll on 4th September. Think I may have been a big daft booking a trip to Spain leaving on 7th September !!!! But have a villa with it's own pool, so I can be lopsided as much as I like , get up when I like , eat when/ if / what I want . I am near a friend who lives out there so won' t be isolated. Have you made any plans for holidays, rewarding yourself for putting up with this like of poo left on our doorsteps? Thanks for keeping in touch , I always look out for you posting and was wondering how you were managing . Have you heard from Dorothee ? Not seen any posts from her recently. Good luck. XxxX.

My brother is being treated for Bone Marrow cancer and he has chemo in tablet form .... so don't fear something that might not happen. You have enough to deal with getting on with now.....

Then I was halfway through Docetaxel..... And then I only had 1 to go then ..... Chemo finished . Yipeeeee. Even then it takes time and patience with yourself to get back some kind of normality. Some people might disagree that i have ever been normal !!! But you know what...... All of it is soooooo worth it .... The other option is not much cop !!! Hope you find YOUR way through treatment .

Don't underestimate the things you do manage to get through on this rocky road .......the fact someone should have forewarned ypu probably just saved you a few sleepless nights !!! not that it makes it right but....every cloud.............. etc etc etc Second....... You have seen all the posts on here about the side effects we have had on TAX.....the biggest one for me being the totally wiped out feeling. This was a cumulative effect. It helped me understand why I was feeling like poo when I saw the blood test results from start of treatment to chemo number 5. The deterioration showed in figures,month by month, which seemed to help the penny drop, that this thing that is meant to save me.......is /was doing what it should do....kill off cells....good and bad. So feeling bad suddenly felt better !!! I hope that sort of makes sense.   You must do what i have seen you say to others......accept that feeling the way you do is \"normal\", allow yourself to be miserable about it.....but set yourself some kind of time limit.....so you can tell yourself it is ok to be miserable for the...... morning......BUT......... that in the afternoon you are going to do ............what ever will make you feel better for a while. Coffee with a friend, get your nails done, hit the shops big time ! or whatever can lift you for a while. It wont make it all go away ( if only) but it will make you see there are some good times still to be had. Lets see what the Mac person says.......just someone else, not involved , to talk to may help. Did you go to counselling ? Whatever happens....you ARE still here NOW.....so enjoy NOW as much as you can, everyday can hold some small precious moments.......and all these little things can just lift us up over the tip of the big hole, other wise known as depression. If none of that works.........................have a large glass of red wine, or the tiple of your choice. Sending you lots of virtual hugs...................................xxxx Sue",

You can't make it better, we have all tried magic wands and they are not all they are cracked up to be !!  But you can just be there, ready to listen, hold her hand, laugh at some opportune or inopportune moments.  Re the scans. You can't second guess the results , others on here have had \"suspect\" scans, biopsies etc etc and in the end, things were ruled out....not necessarily ruled in. If that makes sense. the main thing is they are doing those tests. The waiting for any results is the pits....the absolute worst time. Once treatment starts in many ways it gets easier. My surgeon refuses to use the word cured for any of her patients as she does not have a crystal ball that works, how inconsiderate of her..........what they will be honest about is how treatable your Mums cancer is.  There are so many new treatments around nowadays and on the horizon that many many more cancers whilst not being cureable in the way we view them , are very very treatable. So, go make your Mum a cup of tea, give her a hug and just let here know you are there for her. The nurses on this site are soooooo good, give them a call tomorrow. xxxx   Sue  xxxx",

It certainly does not affect everyone in the same way and I know I have said before the side effects are not compulsory . Also , if you do get anything they have something for most things, you just need to act quick enough. Most importantly in the big scheme of things it is all over relatively quickly , 9 weeks (tax bit) for me and most others ion FECT. Worrying about it , when it might not happen , is understandable but won' t change a thing. Just concentrate on where you are now and the next step along , the rest will happen anyway. Also...... As a post TAX survivor I can say life does get back to \"normal\" , my energy levels are almost back to ore chemo, my hair has grown and I am going without the wig, most of the aches and pains have disappeared , and the ones left I probably would have had anyway .

There will will be oldies ( in more ways than one) like me, newbies like you and some ladies bang in the middle of treatment, so someone will always be able to give advice, comfort ,a cuddle or a kick up the bum. Whatever you need!!! The waiting for things to happen is the worst time . Your mind goes into overdrive. Just don't let it go on Goggle! You will scare yourself silly. This Mac site is brilliant and the nurses so helpful and knowledgable . Once you are on the treadmill you will be surprised how quickly the weeks/ months go by. The good thing us they have caught the little do and do, are going to deal with it. Treatments are so much better and more are just around the corner , so compared to years ago , outcomes are extremely good. Hope to \"see\" you on here and it won't be long before you will be giving another newbie some advice. That's how it works , because the best thing we all help each other at some time or another . Good luck on your roller-coaster ride you have been pushed on !!! Xx Sue xX",

I had been to myGP 6 months prior to diagnosis in march this year ,as I felt a lump near one of my old scars. He said nothing to worry about, only scar tissue. After routine mammogram 6 months later .. 3x lumps found . 2 were then found to be invasive ductsl carcinoma . So I don't know if one leads to another or makes you more susceptible to getting BC .... Having my little lumps removed does not seemed to have stopped me getting this bloody disease. I am more annoyed with myself for not standing up to my GP when he virtually told me i was being daft . I won't let that happen again..... Good luck anyway XxxxxxxX Sue",

We are all going through traumatic times at the moment and it is hardly suprising that we are less tolerant....there is only a certain amount of patience to go around ....and the big \"c\" certainly takes up the lions share. It has not helped that I am reading a self help book that tells me to rid myself of anything that gets in the way of my dealing with my illness. Basically telling me to put myself first. Cut everything else out. So when \"him indoors\" moans because he has slept in an awkward position and has a stiff neck..... all day , on and on.....by evening time...when he has the flicker and has chosen theTV program to watch.......and then promptly falls asleep.... I keep having to tell myself....don't get stressed....but it is easier to say...Urghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, strop off to bed, yes seperate rooms, light off......when he comes in to give me a kiss goodnight, a peck on the cheek, I respond....my Dad used to kiss me goodnight like that, turn over. I do accept that we are BOTH stressed over what is going on at the moment....and to be fair neither of us know how to deal with it. At some point I will have to explain how I feel and get him to talk...but at the moment I just do not feel like doing that. Why does it always have to be me ????? Now that was a big looooooooong winded way of saying.......YOU ARE NOT ALONE .....and it is hardly suprising. Maybe counselling would help....but form e that is a diversion I do not want to go down at the moment. We will get through......somehow. xx Take care xx Keep smiling :>))",

That is not saying everyone has to go round with smiley faces even when they feel crap or are sick and tired of this whole \"c\" thing. But...... If you had not put on your post about feeling like you are back at square one..... You may not have booked your Reflexolgy..... And even if you don't find that is for you..... It may lead to something else, Indian head massage is brilliant too. I like Irenes idea of throwing cups.....something physical works for me ... I normally stomp off and walk the dogs for miles.... Can't do that at the moment , as I am so knackered .... Might be more expensive to stock up old cups etc but less taxing .

I will pay to have further sessions later. Re the results side of things.... Until they did surgery with me my plan was surgery then rads. Because when they went in and removed the cancer they found a micro amount in my lymph node ...... It was all change.. And I ended up having to have chemo. No rads as they were happy that they got clear margins,which means they were able to get each lump out clear of any other organs , and in my case the chest wall . They did not tell me before things could change , not sure if this was better or not.... Ignorance us not always bliss Don't worry toooo much....there is not a lot you can do until you get the results.... then \"whatever\" will be dealt with . Oh dear..... That sounds awful.....

      "Content": "Hi Just seen my Oncologist today for check up, one month following last chemo. He was not suprised I was still feeling tired/achy. He said my bloods had gone down substantially during chemo and would take time to recover. How long ????? He did not know, great !!! What is more worrying is that he does not want to see me again until NEXT SEPTEMBER. The surgeon will see me in MARCH, when I will have a Mamogram on the remaining boob. I have seen lots of posts on here about feeling lost after treatment but i just feel bloody angry at the moment that just 6 months after surgery ....that is it. I will still be having Herceptin and will now start taking Arimidex but just thought there would be more monitoring. But when I said that he said no.....it would be symtom lead from now on.....in other words you have to show signs of \"something\" before they do anything else. Maybe I am being paranoid but... as I am still feeling knackered all the time, having pains in my joints as well as upper back between my shoulders......I would have thought another interim appointment would have been sensible. Thats it rant over....back to you, whilst they have said your bloods are ok.....that might mean OK bearing in mind you have just finished chemo, so they would expect them to be on the low side. Ask them what the norm is and what yours are. It won't change anything...but at least you will know why you are so tired. Then it is just time, good eating, lots of iron rich food etc. I sympathise....it is horrible being so shattered all the time. Big hug xx Sue",

It was a bit of a shock to see myself with the shortest hair ever but great not to find it in the sink/bath/pillow and no more itching/pulling sensation. My grandchild,8, saw me wigless this weekend and said I looked a bit like a boy, a pretty boy, but a boy. Bless kids ... You can trust their honesty! BUT. On the positive side she said I looked like Nanny Sue(me) with my wig on and kept getting it for me when we went out... So at least I now the wig looks good. I am sure your Mum fill be ok whatever she decides. She is lucky to have you, keep up the good work sweet pea.x",

Walking the dogs went from 3-4 mile walk to struggling to take them round the block for a piddle and poo ! I was sooooo out of breath. To be honest it took until about 9 weeks after chemo finished for me not to feel like that.

At the moment your head is either going round and round in circles ( not literally, that not a a sign of BC !!!), or it will feel like its all happening to someone else.  Either way, it won't change where you are right now.There will be others coming on here who I am sure will back me up..............the being told you have or almost certainly have BC ............. but no treatment plan as yet, is the absolute worst time.  Your mind will go into overdrive.  Please don't Google, just stick to the Macmillan and Breast Care sites, they are safe, if not you will frighten yourself silly.  Talk to you Link Nurse or they may give you a Breast care Nurse to talk to.They are so helpful, normally. You will probably have to wait 7-10 days for the biopsy results, then you will move forward. Until then you are sort of treading water.  Try and do something that will take your mind off of all this for a few days, sounds impossible but you can get times when you are not thinking about it all the time. There are lots of support groups, and of course this site and the briiliant on line Nurses are here to help you along the line.  We are a varied bunch, from all over the UK and beyond, different ages, diagnosis, treatments, let alone views, beliefs and ways of expressing ourselves etc etc et,........... but we all have one aim..........to kick cancers butt.  Along with that we help each other, by listening, sharing , having a cry or a laugh together. So once again welcome to our not so little club. So, go do something nice, outrageous, daft or all three rolled into one. let us know how you get on. xxx sue  xx",

I dreaded chemo (and still do), I saw the effects on my husband, so was not over enthusiastic about embarking on something I knew was going to make md feel ill, up until chemo I felt well ! BUT because I was relatively fit and healthy I did a deal with myself.....so long as the side effects were bearable I would go on with chemo. If it got to the point it was affecting my quality of life I would stop and seek other ways of protecting myself. I have not ducked out yet but feel i have been lucky.... So far. I am sure everyone here wishes you al the best ,I had sent you a PM , asking how/what your treatment was , let me know at sometime. So....... Don't stay away. XxxxxX",

I too am HER2 +8/9 and was also was told that Herceptin was on offer WITH chemo. Iam now 2/3rds of the way through and up until last week had not had a single regret. Bad week last week but much better now. All vital signs are holding up.....and they do check you regularily, heart,liver,kidney etc. So hopefully you are relatively fit to start with and will continue that way.Good Luckxxx Sue",

Even so far down the line we need that bit of comfort, reassurance and certainty that all that can be done, is and has been done and the beast has gone . AND in my case want to draw a line in the sand and say \" I don't have cancer anymore\". Every time I get near to that point I seek assurance by asking another question that I put to the Oncologist/Surgeon and am not given the answer I want/need. Like... I am strongly hormone positive. So it seems logical to me that they check my hormone levels to see that they are reducing with the medication I am taking and changes I have made to my diet. Answer, no they don't check. Why ? They are symton lead from now on . I am going to see my GP , I have read they can test for Hormone imbalance and even if I have to pay for it I want it done. Same re scans . I have not had any MRI/CT scans. I am due my first annual mammogram on 4th Feb . So I asked what they were going to do re the left side , where I had MX. Answer , nothing, they are symptom lead. !!!! They do not scan as the likelihood is nothing will show. So my brain says well why do mammogram then. ? So.... I going to put this to my GP , poor thing. I appreciate that these things may be a waste of time but I too want to be able to say with conviction .... I am a survivor.....accepting there are no guarantees and any tests just prove at that point in time I am ok. I feel I could then move on. A lot of what I feel is about control and taking some of that back and I strongly feel that the mind has a lot of effect on how we deal / get through this disease, how we recover and how we survive. I am reading a good book called Getting Well Again which is all about how we participate in our own health/ recovery. I have not got to that Nirvana point yet..... Not finished the book yet or practised all the techniques it suggest...... But my main thing at the moment is to get the professionals , who I do trust clinically, to understand the emotional needs are as important as they affect the physical being. Having re read all of the above.... It sounds daft / neurotic / paranoid !!!! But hey ho that's me. ..... So in a longwinded way , in reply to your question... I don't know !!!! ...... If you find the answer please enlighten me. In the meantime I am going to enjoy each day, things are better , so I am trying to concentrate on living . Have a great day . I am off to walk the dogs in the snow .",

A little bit tired but nothing like the spaced out feeling I got with FEC, What bit of hair I had has started to come out again in the shower this morning...but hey ho the damage had already been done. Will be starting my injections tonight to increase my white blood cell count....and thee nurse did warn that might make me ache more. But honestly at the momemt It is no where near as bad as i thought....especially about reading about the others bad reactions. I too have Tramadol in the wings but have not even had to take paracetomol/ibuprofen. Also have Diclefenic ,just in case I get the tingly/neuopathic (?) feelings.........and this from someone who hates pills....I don't care i am NOT going to suffer if I don't have too.Good Luck....positive vibes coming your way xx",

The worst bit with FEC is the sickness/ nausea but mainly the tiredness. I was lucky mine only lasted 3-4 days then I bounced back. I think it was Dorothee who posted that it is good to give in to your emotions, have a good old cry BUT , set yourself a timescale .... You have sort of said that in your post...

I have not had pain from it, and whilst I can't say I don't know it is there, it has not stopped me sleeping. I jiggle around until I find I am comfy, and can sleep on either side.

My arms are still recovering from the 3 sessions I had before it was fitted. The fitting was ok. Under GA, in and out same day. Only less than an inch incision. I have not had pain from it, and whilst I can't say I don't know it is there, it has not stopped me sleeping. I jiggle around until I find I am comfy, and can sleep on either side. It really was the best thing for meto have done and makes the treatment so much easier. Good Luck. xxx",

But am putting in back on with a vengeance now that I can eat again !!!!! Maybe they will tweak our doses.... Or maybe it means it is working at its best . My oncologist is going to get the full list of what went on when I see him this Thursday. I too seriously thought.... I can t do this .... Or more like I won t do this .

I did get out of puff just going up any slight incline.....and I mean even theraised curbs !! and I all but gave up walking my dogs for a couple of months. But...... even worse it seems to affect you emotionally. I was forever in tears , and I really don't do tears , feeling I could not go on, and this was IT. You have a lot to contend with, it is hardly suprising you feel the way you do. How far are you through this planned treatment ? 8 days post tax means you are probabaly at your lowest ebb. Acknowledge that, it helps you understand why you feel so crap....it is not you it is what the drugs are doing to you. Good and Bad !! It helped me when i saw the chart with all of my blood test results......everything was going in the wrong direction,each session it got worse........ it is what they expect, but somehow that made me understand what my body was trying to cope with. No wonder we feel so ill. BUT>>>>>>It is only temporary, you will get to the end of this treatment, and once it stops you will start to feel better......slowly but surely. Take heart from knowing you are not the only one this bloody concontion has affected in this way.....it wont make you feel physically better but might just help mentally. Big hugs and ....ooops nearly said positive vibes !!!!!.....but mean....we are all with you willing you on through this torture that WILL send this dam awful disease packing.

I was able to get up to go to the toilet, the nurse walked with me just in case I was wobbly. So no bed pan. Yes, the drains are a nuisance, but just that, and they don't like to leave them in too long normally. No one is more clumsy than me and I survived without tripping over them ! They were out on day 3 post op. I took my own towel and wishy washy things , including deodorant , which I could use under the unaffected arm. Get a gentle stick one. Easy access to your PJs, I night button ups but those stretchy best ones are just s good. Do your exercises , they will give you a booklet . Will be thinking of you tomorrow.

Docetaxol is definatley a more aggresive chemo drug and hopefully will do the trick. They just have to find the one that works for you and kicks the invaders into touch. He, the Oncologist, proabably beleives Docetaxol will work and thats why he was dismissive. Another case of the proffessionals not being a good people person(s). They did not keep me for the full 6 hrs on my first Herceptin....they just need to make sure you do not have a reaction. After the first dose I now have the Herceptin and Docetaxol together, so you will get back into a routine again. Just a blip....not a nice one ....but better to get this sorted now and on to a regime that WILL work, than to keep pumping something into you that is ineffective.

Vicious circle. Good Luck this week with your results.....another step towards getting the whole thing sorted. I am to see my Oncologist this week re Chemo...part of me can't wait....the other part wants to just forget it all, hide under the duvet. BUT...we can't so....I will just get on with it.",

They are acting quickly now. You are having all the right scans to make sure you don't get anymore \"surprises\". You are feeling well and if I may so relatively calm. Being on this journey certainly makes you aware if how things can can in a maters if hours/ days. If you do have to have chemo and further surgery somehow you will get through it.. God knows how... but we are all testament to the fact that .... We get knocked down but we get up again. ..... Just as the song says. It just shows his strong ....... or Bloody minded we can be . I don't mean to trivialise what you are going through but just at this time , the worst time. Waiting. There us little you can do but put your faith in the professionals . Big hugs. Xxx",

Your daughter is so lucky to have a Mum there for her and I sure she will appreciate all the support you give her over the next days/ weeks. Just remember you need some time for you too.... I know what it is like to be the carer.....it takes its toll... My husband was ill for 8 months and by the end I was shattered both emotionally and physically. I only had a MX followed by chemo... No recon yet.... But have seem lots of posts on here that have been positive about the recovery from the op and I know I was surprised at how quickly I physically recovered from mine Wishing you both well .....xxxx Sue.

Sasha and everyone else Wow , your sentiments , and how you have expressed them made me cry, not totally in sadness for Annie but also in a way for everything we have been , and still are going through,, each and everyone of us. No we don't have a choice in whether we get this awful disease, we might not have too much say in whether it comes back, just do everything we can to help minimise the risk...... But what we do have is some control over the here and now. Saxxy that quote from The Shawshank Redemption ,is so true. That film was my late husbands favourite, and I can hear/feel him saying that to me now. Thank you . Dorothee, you always put my feelings much better than I can myself. See, this awful experience has brought people whose paths would not normally have crossed, not only together,but together for a purpose. That was the same with our Annie. Lets all use the gift she had , to love those around her, help where she could and live as much as possible . Now I have set myself of again !!!!!! I have one if those plaque things on the wall in my hallway that says Live, laugh and be happy . So be it . Love to all xxxxx",

Annabel touched so many of us with her words, honesty about how she was feeling , about her family and giving sound advice to all of us at some time or another . It is still unbelievable that things happened so quickly , or even that they happened at all ! She is missed by many of us .... Let alone her poor family ,who must still be reeling from what has happened. We can only hope that she has found a place of peace and that her beloved other half and children find some comfort in knowing what a special lady they had as a mother and wife albeit for all too short a time. I know she will remain in my thoughts and heart .",

      "Content": "Hi  Jenny and Ethel and all on this thread   Well if we are talking size.....I was/am 34JJ,(now only 1 is ).   I understand exactly where you are coming from. I totally hate being lopsided, and the remaining boob looks sooooo big and odd now. 1st thing in the morning is the worst before I put my falsie on. Not a good look.  Yes I have had to re think my wardrobe, lots had to go, some tops have to have a cami under now. I know I look ok once \"dressed\". I have said this before , I would prefer to have two flatties than be like this but at the moment that is not an option, neither is reconstruction. I don't think it is unusual/ unreasonable to feel as we do.   What keeps me from going stir crazy is that all of the crap I (we) have gone through has given me the best  chance of living.  I made that choice.....I want to live, when I was diagnosed, and having gone through all that chemo could chuck at me.........I feel even more determined this bloody disease will not win. Just like I am now  feeling better physically I am sure I will also find the way emotionally. The other option is not an option.  Life is worth it, even when its crap. re Swimming, I managed to stay afloat, and not capsize. I swam without a falsie, but only because I was in the pool by myself. I am going to get myself a proper waterproof  falsie. I bought a couple of mastectomy swimming costumes which I tried with my non waterproof boobie and they looked OK. No it is not the same as before............. but it is a choice of giving up something I enjoy or making the best of what I have.  I wish I had a choice but I haven't. re Getting comfy. I can honestly say I now have found a way of sleeping comfortably. I used to always have those orthopaedic pillows but found I had to buy a soft one if I want to sleep on  \"that\" side. So i have them like a V shaped one. So I have a hard one on side , soft on the other. It works for me. You will find your way. I don't want to come across as Mrs Positive, because I really really am not but I cannot afford to let this \"thing\" get the better of me.  Good luck........................Things will get better......somehow !!!!!!!!!    xxxxx  Sue   xxxxx",

I just wanted you to know there is light at the end of the tunnel My mx was in mar 12 and I recovered really well . Still hate being lopsided but happier to be alive . Chemo took its toll , finished in sept 12 , and it took longer than I anticipated for me to get my strength back . I still have weary days.... But I think that happened before BC and I just carried on regardless.. not now.. I give myself time to recharge my batteries . The hair comes back , nails re grow , toes feel less like they belong to someone else Mentally I have had a few melt downs post treatment but that's hardly surprising is it !!! Acknowledging the actual trauma if what happened seemed to hit me months after chemo finished but I feel I have come out if that phase a stronger person. I am still on Herceptin until July , so that's my next goal. No more 3 weekly trips to the hospital and sniffly nose for a fees days after . My port can come out . Anastrazole has its high and lows but for me apart from the initial night sweats it had been doable . I know others have not be so lucky .... But there are always other options . Reconstruction or not ???? That can wait. I want to enjoy being the new me for a while. Wishing you all ......some peace amongst the mayhem of the rocky road ......some joy from getting over the hurdles this disease has us jumping ......some hope that you have the better of the unwanted invader . ......some new / improved friendships , made in adversity but which will I am sure stand the test of time .

      "Content": "Hi I am sure you did not offend anyone .... We have all been there and know how the mind ....and mouth work !!! Still you had good news... That is great. I too knew i had DCIS and as it was in two (they thought 3 areas, left, right and centre ) places MX was the surgical option . I asked for both boobs to be done but they flatly refused , but have heard on this site bothers have bern luckier, if that is you feel lucky having to have it in the first place. !!!! Just think post op ....the bloody \"c\" will be gone, history , It was thought I would then have radiotherapy but my sentinel mode had micro metatases so I was \"offered\" chemo. That was something I dreaded but it does improve my chances of it not spreading. The surgeon said no scan would pick up any lurking seefdlings hiding elsewhere in the body now or maybe for even a few years and it is my insurance policy. So I have gone along with it 4 down 2 to go. Honestly it has not been anywhere near as bad as I thought , not great but do able. The surgery was also much much better than you can imagine, honest . So.... Just wait and see.... Easier said than down I know.... But my bubbie used to say worry about things you can do something about... So busy yourself organising for your op , lots of tips about what to take etc that I cm somebody the other ladies will chip in with. Do something nice... The sun is shining , get yourself out doing whatever makes you feel good , it will take your mind of \"it \" for a while anyway. :0). XxxX",

      "Content": "Hi I too was offered this trial , under no pressure though. I had been told that the margins from my MX were good and I would not be offered radiotherapy . The Oncologist went through the possible side effects of the radiotherapy and the possible benefit , which seemed mainly they it reduces the risk of the cancer returning to the same site . Having been given chemo as my insurance policy against any \"seedlings\" left lurking anywhere in the body ..... I decided against joining the trial. I did feel a big guilty and sometimes wonder if I should have gone ahead with it..... Just in case . But. I just wanted my \"treatment\" ovr and done with.... Although I am still on Herceptin and have just started Aromidex !!!! I have been on two other trials so I have done a little bit to help the cause !!!!! Good luck with your decision.. Do what is right for you . XxSue",

      "Content": "Hi Kipper   I dont use the site so much nowdays,but still log in every now and then. Your title rang a bell with ,e. this time last year i was feeling the same. Honest. Having gone on the rollercoaster ride I now feel like I am on a more sedate merry go round ! I had a Mastectomy , Chemo and am still on Herceptin until July. Also on Anastrozole tablets for 5 yrs. All I can say is it does get better, somehow.......don't know how sometimes, but you do get through it. And it is sooooooooooooo worth it. Use this site.....it helps so much to have someone....and there is always someone, whatever time of day/night, that knows EXACTLY how you are feeling, and can give some practical advice. If not definately some moral support. It works. Where abouts are you.?  Apart from making \"virtual\" friends here on Macland, I have also made some really brilliant friends who are local, and we meet up for coffee and a natter every now and then. Try and think about the next step....one step at a time....it becomes too much if you try and think of it all at once. So many things rushing around in your brain.  PM me if you want. I am sure you will find others who are around about the same stage of treatment but it might be nice to know someone who has been there and done it...........almost !!!        ",

Pulling yourself together......oh my .......you have every reason not to.......... but you will   !   You are obviously a fighter .....and that itself will help you get through this minefield. Allow yourself some time to let it all sink in and just be, dont be so hard on yourself. To lose a parent at the same time................cant be comprehended....I missed my Mum and Dad so much during my treatment....and I am 58 and they have been gone for 6 and 10 years. Yes the first chemo is part of it, but at least that means you have started to get rid of the unwanted guest (cancer). All of the other things you have and are going through will have a bearing on how you feel.....but do you know what....I can feel you will get there. What is your Breast Care nurse like ? Can you talk to her ? She might know if there is a group locally you can join, people going through the \"c\" thing. I am in Kent and have found a couple of ladies I can talk to.   Maybe there is someone here on Macland in your neck of the woods. If not us virtual friends are here....and sometimes just putting it in writing helps.   x",
