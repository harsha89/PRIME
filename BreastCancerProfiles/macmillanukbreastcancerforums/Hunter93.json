    "Content": "Hi all, Just have a few questions regarding my mums recent diagnosis. She has been diagnosed with stage two breast cancer, which has spread to her bones and ovaries. She has two types lobular and ductal and it is hormone receptive which I've been told is good because it means there's lots of treatment options. I was just wondering if anybody has a had a similar experience and whether they can shed some light on the treatment process. She has already had an 18 week course of chemo getting it every few weeks and goes for her next scans in a few months. Thanks for taking the time to read, Paige",
