    "Content": "I  was diagnosed with breast cancer (left breast) for the second time on Friday 13th August 2010, I had a wide local excision surgery on Monday 13th September 2010 and had to have a re-excision on Wednesday  29th September 2010 as they didn't see a clear margin. I am now waiting to have my Radiotherapy treatment. I was previously diagnosed with breast cancer (right side) in December 2002 which was a huge shock as I was only 32 years of age, I had a lumpectomy and radiotherapy and underwent  a breast reconstruction using muscle from my back. As my cancer has been eostrogen positive both times now it has been decided that I should have my ovaries shut down, I was given an option of either having Zoladex injections for three years or having my ovaries removed - I have decided that the best option for me would be to have them removed. My thoughts were if I decided on the injections and these are only for 3 years my ovaries would start working again and I could possibly have breast cancer for a 3rd time in another few years. I was wondering has any of you had this operation and what are your thoughts and experiences been like? how long did you have to wait before it was done? was it keyhole surgery? how long is the recovery period? would I still need to take tamoxifen after this type of surgery and would I need any hormone therapy medication? Many Thanks & Best Wishes Claire x x",
