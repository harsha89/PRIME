      "Content": "Hi I swapped to aromasin from letrozole. I already had joint/ muscle pain due to DDD and arthritis. The letrozole made my joint pain much worse. I tolerated it for 8 weeks, then stopped taking it. I was taking nothing for 6 weeks then was prescribed exemestane. The difference was marginal. I have stopped taking them also and have appointment with the oncologist at the end of January. I might try them againÂ  before that though, because I am getting quite anxious that taking nothing could increase my chance of the cancer returning. Also I have noticed thinning hair and my hairline has receded by about 1 inch. I am a positive person.The op and radiotherapy was a breeze and everything was going really well until these tablets, which have just caused endless misery. JU 26",
