      "Content": "Hi Maxine- I just joined the group and finished 3rd round of FEC last Monday- like you I really hated it and in cycle 1 had what my oncologist said was a 'torrid' reaction! Vomiting for 4 days off and on, then temp spiked at 38.8 and was in isolation in the hospital with neutropenic sepsis! They reduced my dose by 20% and gave me Emend with the Ondansatron (urgh, constipation!) which was better but still felt sick with no appetite for 4 -5 days each time. Now moving on to 3 cycles of TPH- all pre surgery. Hang in there- I felt sick just going back in to the chemo ward this time! M",

      "Content": "Hi JennyEm, I'm fairly new on here but just over half way through chemo, pre surgery, 3 cycles FEC and 3 TPH- I found with FEC I was in bed for about 3-4 days on and off, although reduced in last cycle and improved each time- then I could walk outside and get places, and even in weeks 2-3 work and exercise well at home. Fatigue is always good to listen to, but getting some exercise gently in does help! I listened to a lot of women who had been through this and researched the nurses and decided cold cap sounded painful and not really worth it- and have seen that it's added time to treatment. I got a short cut, then on day 15 (ish?) it really started to come out and hurt so I went to my local barber and had a grade 2 first-! Very liberating and I quite liked the look- they promised me free shaves after that and were super sweet-had a grade 0 as soon as went patchy and have been rocking headscarves and caps since! It's tough near treatment times but there are days, even weeks you feel normal, even great again! As you may see I'm writing this at 2.40am, so I'm struggling a little with docatoxal (fluey and insomnia) but happy to share and very happy to be getting the best treatment. MatchlessorindaÂ ",
