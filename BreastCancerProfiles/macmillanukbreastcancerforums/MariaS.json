      "Content": "I know exactly how you all feel. My sister has managed to ignore the fact I have cancer. When I last saw her (February), she didn't say anything about the fact that my hair had fallen out, or wish me luck with the MX I was having the following week. Admittedly, she has a neurological disease, and has been the sickest person in the family for 20 years so i think she's unable to relinquish her crown. On the plus side, some friends I worked with 6 years ago all took an afternoon off work to schlepp halfway across London to take me out to lunch. How fabulous are they!! It's a bit swings & roundabouts.",
