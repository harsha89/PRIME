      "Content": "It\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve been on here but had some great advice before.  Last June I was diagnosed with breast cancer, I\u2019ve had 6 rounds of chemo, mastectomy and last week finished 15 rounds of radiotherapy. I\u2019m still having Herceptin jabs every 3 weeks. This evening I was lathering on the cream to treat the sore skin from radiotherapy and I\u2019ve noticed a hard, round lump. It feels exactly like the lump I found last May and I\u2019m freaking out! Will call my breast nurse first thing but now I can\u2019t sleep and I\u2019m a right mess!  Can it be cancer after all the treatment I\u2019ve had? Is it something not so sinister? I\u2019ll take any reassurance right now! X",

I\u2019m hoping the breast care nurse at the hospital will see me and by pass the GP as I\u2019m still under their care as still having treatment. I\u2019m really hoping it\u2019s the radiotherapy but any lump now is going to freak me out, I guess I\u2019ll be living with the the rest of my life. I have my daughters birthday tomorrow to distract me over the weekend x",

      "Content": "Thanks for you reply youngatheart and I\u2019m shocked to hear you haven\u2019t had a follow up appointment! They told me I\u2019ll have one with radiologist in 6-8 weeks. My oncologist appointment has been booked for months and is a follow up after chemotherapy. I would definitely insist on a check up, like you say to know what to look out for! Any lump I find now is going to fill me with panic so just getting some confirmation that this is normal is what I need. I\u2019d be very surprised if it were cancer, my last radiotherapy session was a week ago, surely nothing would have survived?  I wish you all the best, please keep me posted xx",

She called back to say no appointment had been made and that clinic is full! She said she sweet talked them and has got me an appointment for 7th May which is forever away! I see my oncologist before then so will ask them then to take a look. ",
