    "Content": "Hi I amtwo weeks post op, I had two drains, one came out within a week but the other came out a day or two later but came out prematurely because it got accidently pulled. I had a build up of fluid and on Monday, almost two weeks after sergery I had it drained at the hospital, it was very saw afterwards but the next day it eased of a bit. I am not saying I am pain free but I feel I can move without being scared of being in so much pain. It is getting more bareable now. I took arnica tablets straight after sergery to help with bruising and healing. I am more saw than in pain now and would like some relief from clothes rubbing and tender skin.I had alot of pain around my armpit where they checked my lymph glands and the back of arm at top, which I asume is nerve damage or something but it is easing off after two weeks of sergery, maybe draining the fluid helped I dont know but it is more bareable as time goes on. I feel there is light at the end of the tunnel after two weeks, its getting easier. I am on antibiotics at moment, which may be helping. I wish you all the best, it will get easier so stay strong.Â ",
