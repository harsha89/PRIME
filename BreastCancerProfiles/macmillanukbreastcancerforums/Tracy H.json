      "Content": "Hi Chris, I was diagnosed over a year ago with primary breast cancer and secondaries in the bones and liver. Initially they gave me less than a year to live, happy to say have exceeded that, when I saw my consultant in January and asked what now? as I should have passed away, they told me that initially when they saw my ct results the 'team' had written me off in 12 weeks, the morale of the story never give up hope and stay positive. Chemo did shrink my largest liver tumor and the others remained the same size. They now class me as arrested and I wobble off and look forward to the future. I wish your sister every good wish and please stay positive it does help. Lots of love to you, Tracy xxx",
