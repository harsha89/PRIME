      "Content": "The side effects are what they use as fillers ..please go back to your GP and demand the original patent of tamoxifen ...I am on femera ( patent ) more commonly known as  letrozole ...my drug costs £80/£90 a month and the other cheap generics cost £3/£4 a month ..that kind of says it all !! A lot of the drugs are made in India and China and come under different regulations so even requesting a European generic is better ...I've just had a month off ..I also take cod liver oil and turmeric each day ...hope this helps  Rainbow Debs xxx",

My friend had triple negative at 35....had chemo rt the works and 3 weeks before her 5 year clear the little bugger had attached to her scarring....ending with a mastectomy which she wish she had originally but we are all great with hindsight...she's clear again and doing well.. I think what I'm  trying to say, very badly.
