      "Content": "Hi everyone, first of all you are all an inspiration. I almost feel like a drama queen for even posting this to people who have there diagnosis and are battling through!  I first noticed a pain in my left breast around 7 weeks ago, but I had a lesion on the side of my nipple that weeped and didn't heal and crusted over for a month or two longer. Then around 4 weeks ago I noticed my breast had drooped I used to be able to see both nipples point outwards but now just the right one is visible, and on closer inspection the breast had changed shape. I made an appointment with the doctor and she examined me and said she could feel 2 lumps and see the changes I had described.  She then rang for a 2 week referal to the breast clinic and used the words \"suspected breast cancer\". My heart dropped, I thought can it be that cut and dry? Surely she shouldn't have said that! My mind has been in overtime ever since. My appointment is Monday morning and every second is dragging. Thankyou and love in advance x",
