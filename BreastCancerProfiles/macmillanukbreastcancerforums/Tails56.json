    "Content": "Hi, I'm based in S Wales too and had treatment in Velindre. I had 6 sessions of FEC followed by 15 x radiotherapy.  I used the cold cap but  can't say it was successful for me as I did lose a lot of hair but didn't lose it completely which meant it began to grow back quickly once treatment ended. They gave me a list of places for wigs which accept the NHS voucher. I also bought one on ebay which I ended up using more than my more expensive one.  Good luck to you xx SS",
