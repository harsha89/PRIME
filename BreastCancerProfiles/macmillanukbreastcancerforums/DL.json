Hoping to play a hockey match before chemo as I was top goal scorer at end of November.  Having read conversations on here a lot of peeps were given choices for axillary node clearance but they just cleared mine as they thoight there were at least 2 affected.  Results...only one node affected out of 9.  I havent been told about percentages regarding chemo???? Maybe becuase the ductal cnacer was stage 3 invasive I am just being given cheno but have a pre assessment for the 6 sessions ( every 3 weeks for the next 4 months) on 9th January. What do I ask regarding percentages???? Will be taking anti oestrogen tablets for the next ten years  and possible herceptin injections ( one every 3 weeks) for one year..  Also my brother tells me more organics more greens less sugar and less stress at work can all help too.  Hapy New Year DL aged 51.    ",
