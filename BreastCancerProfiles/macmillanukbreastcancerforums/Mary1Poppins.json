      "Content": "Hi ladies,  Reading lots of posts here has got me very emotional but is also offering me a huge amount of inner strength because you all offer so much support.   I'm here not because I have a cancer diagnosis but because I have been diagnosed with 20 fibroadenomas across both breasts.  I had felt a lump in my breast in May so got it checked by my GP who referred me to the breast clinic.  An USS revealed the multiple fibroadenomas but the sonographer frightened me when he said that they weren't sure how they were going to manage me because there were so many.   I have been reassured that they are all benign but one of them has a couple of lobules (whatever that means) and so they are monitoring this in case it's a phyllodes tumour.   My initial reaction was that I wanted them all removed because the thought of having that many lumps in my breast is very unnerving but the consultant said that to have them all removed would mean having a double mastectomy.    I really don't know what to do because people who have one, two, three fibroadenomas usually have them biopsied or removed but im being advised to watch and wait because there are just too many.   Feeling very anxious and have just been put on medication because the anxiety is taking over my life.   Can anyone shed some light? Is there anyone else in a similar situation?",

      "Content": "Was back on the phone to the breast clinic yesterday because these little critters are still multiplying. Yesterday I felt 2 new ones but today I can feel 4 new ones and it's only been 2 weeks since i got my MRI results.  Only thing is, I got an answering machine so had to leave a message.  They said they'd reply within 24 hrs but they didn't so i'm gonna have to ring them again tomorrow.   I don't want to be pestering them but I also don't want to get lost in the system which I can imagine would be quite easy with the amount of patients they must see. Would they do another MRI so soon after already having one do you think??  ",
