      "Content": "Hi,  I'm no expert, but it is reasonable to say if you were having night sweats before surgery that you will have them after too. In my experience they tend to come & go sometimes in clusters for me. The recent weather may not have helped also. Try not to think as every symptom in terms of it being linked to cancer. It may be helpful to make a list of things to ask your oncologist as there is always something i forget. Good luck Xx",

      "Content": "Hiya, Unfortunately a lot of  health professionals have a bad habut of underestimating things as they deal with it  every day.  I don't consider it a minor op at all the general anastasia takes a whike to get over as i thought just a good sleep woukd solve that but  was wrong. My sister said oh it's only keyhole surgey isnt it. Ha ha i don't know how big her key is. Anyway i guess what im trying to say is ut takes as long as it takes everyone is different & if it hurts don't do too much. The exercises are important & do help. Yoy could take regular pain killers if ur not already & if you are at all worried contact someone. Good luck Xx",

      "Content": "Hello, I had a lumpectomy in march & for  around 5-6weeks after the area was hard, but i guess it was to do with inflammation under as it must make the surrounding tissue swell to be attacked like that. It soon went softer & is almost back to normal now (apart feom the obvious missing lump) from the odd twinge or throbbing now & again. Hope this message helps a little  Good luck Xxx",
