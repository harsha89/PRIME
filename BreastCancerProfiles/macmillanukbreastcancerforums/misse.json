      "Content": "Hello I am the partner  of misse who has undergone mastectomy and in process of chemo. I cant imagine how a woman feels, however i do know how men feel. I would say be careful to  ensure he is genuine. I must also say not all men are to concerned about breast or there size. I will love misse no matter what, and I am sure there are genuine men out there that will not be as worried as you are about the scars left by this horrid problem. Take your time and do things at your pace, if its not right be sure there will be other options, although i would find the thought of finding any other relationship a major challenge in itself, so it may just be that that frightens you more.",
