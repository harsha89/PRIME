      "Content": "I had a mastectomy on April 30th 2007. I was 26 years old at the time and it was 8 weeks before my wedding. I really didnt want a mastectomy but it was my best option and immediate reconstruction was out of the question as it would have delayed the mastectomy and further treatment eg chemo. I accepted all this at the time because I was PROMISED I would get reconstruction and that I would be a priority blah blah blah.....2 and a half years later and I am still waiting!! I got quite close to getting the reconstruction once... I met with the plastic surgeon at my local hospital in October 07. I have a heart abnormality (unrelated) and he wanted me to see the cardiologist to make sure I was fit for the long surgery involved in the reconstruction. He then said come back and see my in April 08 and it will be about a 3 month wait. Great I thought, not long then. Bear in mind I was on Herceptin at this time and he knew this. April 08 and went back to see him. He then decided he couldnt do the surgery whilst I was on Herceptin and that I could go back to see him in January 09 and I would be first on his list!! Well you can imagine I was quite upset. Through all the chemo and bad times all I kept thinking was something good would come out of it at the end. I would feel like a young woman again not a freak, it would give me back a little of the so much that was taken from me. He wasnt very sympathetic to me and pretty much accused me of being neurotic so I left. I got really close another time... It took a while but I got over that episode and decided to try a different surgeon. I had heard good things about the team at the Norfolk and Norwich so I got referred there. I met a really wonderful Dr, Miss Ali who restored my faith in the fact that this would one day happen! She gave me options and time to think then in March 09 I finally went on the waiting list!! WOO HOO!! Not exactly. In May I found some lumps above my collarbone, had these investigated. I had a scan and needle aspiration one Tuesday morning, during which I asked the dr to be honest about what she thought they were. She said she was concerned but couldnt be one hundred percent sure until they got the results. Later that afternoon I got a call from N & N offering me my reconstruction for the following week due to a cancellation. Sods law.  Well I said yes as I thought through everything I have done what they have told me and they have made me promises which were not kept. I thought maybe they would let me have the one thing I really wanted but it wasnt going to be. Anyway I never got my reconstruction, what I got instead was a secondary breast cancer diagnosis. I have seen Miss Ali who says she will reconstruct me but not yet. The time has to be right. She took me off her appointment list but said I can contact her any time and it will all be arranged but I cant help thinking it never will. Do they see it as a waste of money now? I dont know. I am positive about my future, I know I dont have forever but I'm pretty sure I will have quite a few ahead of me and things are going well. So I am asking if anyone else has experienced anything similar or still been given reconstruction despite secondaries etc. Or if anyone has any advice for me. I have kind of resigned myself to the fact this is me now but I would love to feel 'normal' again. Put on a nice bra and it look like I have 2 breasts, not one and a 'thing'.",

      "Content": "This questionnaire sounds like a good idea, they are obviously planning on using the data to make some changes to the system so to speak. I really think it should be up to the patient if they want reconstruction or not and if they do the Drs should go out of their way to make it happen and then adapt the treatment plan accordingly afterall reconstruction is a massive part of the recovery from breast cancer. I think for us the most important, and I am sure it is that way for alot of other women. It also seems women are told very different things by different people. I always knew I would need rads but that was never bought into the equation. I know someone who insisted on immediate recon even though she needed chemo like me and they went on to offer her rads but she refused it. So that goes to show they will give you radiotherapy even if you have had reconstruction. There needs to be some very definitive procedures as when you talk to other women and you hear this it really gets you down and I dont know about you but I feel cheated. I saw a report on mastectomy and reconstruction where they believe delaying it gives better physical results and the psychological impact is lesser than when its done immediately. I dont know if I believe that or not. I think its because if you have lived with not having a breast or breasts then you are very grateful for what you get with the recon even if its not as good as the originals. I'm sorry but I find that quite sad and a bit of an insult. They seem to put such an effort into saying its our 'choice' but deep down I feel they sway you into doing what they feel is best and you never really do get the choice. Once again Sue thankyou for replying, it has been great to talk to someone about this who really understands. I wish you all the best too. Chrissi xxx",

      "Content": "Thanks for replying Sue, I was worried no one else would look at my thread!! I think I will do exactly what you have advised and just ask them out right if I will still get the op. At least if they say its something that they never do then I will have to accept it and not keep the hope that one day I will get it. I think unless you have had a breast removed it is hard to understand how it actually makes you feel. Lots of people say to me 'you cant tell' and well at least youre still here etc. I cant say that ever gives me comfort. I am not a vain person and yes breasts really are only comsmetic if you want to be blunt. But they are the main thing that differentiate women from men in the most obvious sense.  I know I will never be the same person I was before but I would like to be as close a possible. Thanks again Sue, hope you are well and everything goes well with your op in the new year. Bet you just cant wait. Love Chrissi xxx ",

      "Content": "I think the first thing would be to talk to your oncologist about this. I have read that getting pregnant doesnt increase your chance of getting cancer or make the cancer grow faster but I dont know if that is true of ER+ breast cancer. That said you hear all the time of women going on to have families after breast cancer and a friend of mine, another young sufferer has just announced she is expecting. So try not to worry Emma, I'm sure everything will work out and you too will get to have a baby. There is also a link on the right hand side of the page where you can ask a Macmillan nurse any questions you have, maybe give that a try too. I have never done it so dont know what it involves and how long it takes for a response but it might be quicker than trying to talk to your onc. All the best Love Chrissixx",

      "Content": "Hi Tessa, By FEC-T I'm assuming you mean FEC and Taxotere but I may be totally wrong!! I had this regimen too and used the cold cap for my first cycle but I just found it a real chore to sit at the Macmillan unit pretty much for the whole day so I didnt have it any more after that. The experience wasnt too bad as I had really long thick hair, just found it quite cold on my forehead but you soon get used to it. My hair didnt start to fall out until around cycle 3 of chemo so I think if I had carried on using it I would have kept my hair bar some thinning. My hair started to grow back a little on Taxotere but only millimetres. I think the concensus is 50/50 really, I've met people it worked well for and people who lost their hair straight away. The only drag of it is if you decide to use scalp cooling you cant really do anything with your hair eg you will be told not to wash/brush it too much or tie it back too tight, things like that as this could help make your hair come out. Hope this has been helpful. All the best Chrissi xx",
