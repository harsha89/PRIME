I went to just plums to see one that I seem online and it looked nothing like the picture, I think you need to just go and try lots and see what suits you. Good luck with your chemo, I hope it's not to hard on you. X. Joyce. X.",

I am going to a place called Parruche in Virginia st in the merchant city. you have to phone for an appointment to have a fitting. The NHS voucher won't pay for a real hair wig, but some of the synthetic ones are lovely. Hope this helps Joyce. X.",
