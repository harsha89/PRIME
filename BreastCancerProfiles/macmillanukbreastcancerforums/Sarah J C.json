      "Content": "Hi Jac, I have just read your post which I found very interesting and informative.  My situation is that I have had Neoadjuvant chemo ( before surgery ) then 2 weeks ago a WLE and SNB.  Last week I saw my surgeon and she explained that she had removed 1 lymph node only and that this had cancer cells. She said the treatment she recommended was a total axillary removal.  Which sounds very drastic to me, the alternative she said was to have radiotherapy only, which feels a bit all or nothing.   I am interested in your experience where you write your surgeon was ok to remove only levels 1 and 2.  I asked my surgeon if I had the option to only remove some but not the entire lymph nodes,  and she replied that was not possible.  So I am trying to gather more information in order to make a decision.  Can I ask you how did you find out about the option to remove only levels 1 and 2. I hope your recovery is going well. Thank you for taking the time to read my query.  Very best wishes, Sarah",

      "Content": "Hi Jac, thanks for your reply which I found helpful. Your approach to this difficult decision seems to make sense to me. I am worried about not having any surgery but also the risks involved in doing so, which leaves me moving back and forth in my thinking [ I\u2019m a bit like that at the best of times ].  Did you find it difficult to conclude what to do?  Do you feel ok about the decision you made? The numbness I keep reading about, with different peoples\u2019 experiences,  does that eventually ease off, do you know? It sounds like you are doing everything you could do to look after yourself. I hope the physio is helpful. I agree about the personal path, it is a journey.  Thanks  Sarah x",

      "Content": "Hi DFishcake  I am in a similar position to you.   I have had Neo adjuvant chemo and surgery and a SNB where 1 node was removed and under biopsy found to have tumour cells present at microscopic level.   it has been suggested to me that I have an ANC and I am now trying to make a decision.... difficult for me at the best of times!    I am interested in what you have written concerning that you had the first 4 draining nodes removed but I don't quite understand. You mention you had lymph involvement, does that mean you had a biopsy as I did when you had surgery and had a positive result or did you know that already?   Re the removal of the first 4 draining nodes, would you mind telling me the thinking behind that as it hasn't come up as an option for me with any of the professionals I have spoken to.  This would help me as it sounds like there are similarities between our treatment path and I haven't heard of your option before, I am a bit stumped as to which way to go. Thank you x",

      "Content": "Hi DFishcake Thank you for that information. It does sound a little like we're at similar points.  I will have the radiotherapy I'm pretty sure of that, it doesn't worry me so much as the ANC, that's the thing I'm having trouble with getting my head around. like you I have been feeling positive about the treatment I have had so far and this was an unexpected twist, I guess  its all been a bit unexpected! I hope the scan was ok and that like me you come to a decision soon. Good luck to you too, and thank you for your time x",

I am thinking it must be helpful in many ways to get back to some work and \u2018normality\u2019 .  It is I find a difficult decision to make as there are \u2018what ifs\u2019 on both sides.
