      "Content": "I had a mammogram, ultrasound and then a core biopsy today after finding a lump on my upper inner breast a few weeks back. The doctor told me she was sure it was benign.  I will get the results next week.  My question is, is there a chance she\u2019s wrong and if not, why would she feel the need to perform the biopsy? Would she tell me this if she wasn\u2019t sure.  I\u2019m so worried ",
