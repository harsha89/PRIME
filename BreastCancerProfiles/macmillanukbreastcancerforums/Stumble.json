    "Content": "Hi everyone. I came here hoping someone can give me some advice, or even some words of comfort. Maybe my feelings on this are silly on the scale of things. I had a bilateral mastectomy last month due to invasive ductal cancer, followed by an immediate reconstruction. Emotionally I was handling everything rather well. I have been having regular check-ups with the breast surgeon due to my wound getting slightly infected. There have been days my breast surgeon has been unable to see me as he has been called away on emergencies so I have seen another breast surgeon. I was fine with this. Recently I have been feeling extremely violated by the amount of men touching my breasts. I can no longer look my breast surgeon (or his replacement, or my oncologist) in the eye. I spend my appointments looking at the floor trying so hard not to cry. My husband noticed this at my last appointment but I made up some excuse about needing to sneeze as to why my eyes looked red and watery.  I'm due to see the breast surgeon again on Monday and I want to cancel. I cant keep going through feeling like this every time I'm asked to take off my clothes for them to touch and stare at my breasts. It's making me feel dirty. Deep down I know they need to do the things they do to make sure I'm healing and to check everything is ok. These men are part of a team that are keeping me alive. They removed the cancer. I should be thanking them, not feeling disgusted by them touching and staring at me. Why am I feeling like this? Is it normal? I cannot tell them how I feel. I would feel more awkward telling them how I feel. I also haven't seen my BCN since the day of my operation (they always seem too busy with other ladies when I am there). Thanks ",
