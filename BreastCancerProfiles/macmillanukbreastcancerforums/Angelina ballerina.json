I would speak to your BCN and not suffer in silence. she can check then that its normal pain and not from an infection or something. I had co codomol and ibuprofen. hope this helps angie xx",

I then had rads and now im on hormone therapy. I wouldn't worry too much because its not as bad as it appears to be once you get used to it and you quickly learn to deal with the side effects. don't get me wrong, its not a piece of cake, I just think sometimes you can worry about things that might not even affect you. at least you can have a good Christmas before it starts. as for the hair loss, I shaved my head 2 weeks after the first fec because I wanted to be in control of it. I had a wig and it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be because I had very short hair to lose instead of long hair. none of its nice, but you can do it! good luck and happy Christmas angie x",

I would think hard about exposing yourself to them. The other problem I found is that you will become unreliable, the side effects come and go so randomly that you might not get to work when you need to, therefore unreliable. I don't like being off work, I find in mind numbing, but ive had to give in just now (although I will be sneaking back in a couple of weeks) ive got 12 weeks of treatment left (with rads) and theres no way I can stay at home that long.hope this helps.  angie x",

I looked like darth vader when he took his mask off to young skywalker, fat bald head!! old man look !! I felt awful, still do actually, but gradually I'm heading toward recon when I will be rebuilt to something near normal and hopefully that will help my own perception of what I look like to others. your bf would have probably cheated on you anyway, its not because you had a mx, so that's good that he's gone. you now need to slowly have faith in yourself, you don't look disgusting, no one does, you just feel crappy about yourself.

      "Content": "hi I had asda bras, factory shop sports bras are very good although you have to squeeze the cushion into a quite small hole but it does go in ok, and primark have good sports bras that are lovely and soft too. The good thing about the sports bras is that you can 'step into' them rather than having to go over your head, they feel like a crop top.  when you first have your op you might struggle with fastening at the back. I had a front fastener for the first few weeks. hope it all goes well angie xx",

I do know the chemo has reduced some lumps in other women. I will have reconstruction surgery next year, maybe theyre trying to avoid that by doing a lumpectomy?

I think ive stiffened up from the inactivity so I thought I'd give it a go. whats your experiences, or how else do you exercise gently. I do have a very physical job, its the bendy bits that don't really bend anymore - need to sort them out. angie xx",

I had difflam mouthwash, extra painkillers, extra everything really because straight away I informed the oncologist and she made sure I was well equipped for it to not happen a second time. I suggest you let them know when you can, so they can prepare for your second one and they will tell the pharmacy so that you get everything you need, then you wont suffer like this again. I feel for you, I remember it well. its not normal for everybody I don't think, just some of us react a bit more to it than others, I still had the second and third with no problems because I had a carrier bag of preventative drugs too . get well soon hugs angie xx",

The tumour was grade 2 and 3. this was quite disturbing at the time but remember that your treatment plan will be tailored to your needs. I had chemo, will have rads and will get hormone therapy for 5 years. I was told by the surgeon the morning after my op that it was 'all clear' - then they had the results from pathology for the lymph nodes - then they decided what to give me. ive got 2 more chemo to go and I've become the 'chemo' person that we all become, its not too bad, sometimes its a bit irritating when you want to get on with normal life. ive had some days of work but i'm still working even now, I wont give in and let it take over completely. Once you get a grip of it you'll be able to put your house in order, then you'll feel better too. good luck with your treatment, angie x",
