    "Content": "I have just watched this programme and as i suspected was in tears for most of it, but especially when Sally lost her battle, my heart went out to her young children and also to all of the family. It's the same devastation of course for all families who lose someone. My mum died 18 months ago from lung cancer so was familiar with a lot of the chemo routine etc, but shortly afterwards I found out I had bone cancer and last September I had to have a lot of my right femur bone and knee replaced and luckily they got it before it escaped the bone and sprang up elsewhere and didn't need to have chemo or radiotherapy (so far), but am now being monitored through chest and leg xrays every three months, so it's still new and all very scary stuff., I actually got the current all clear yesterday! Well done for such a brilliant, if sad, programme. I wish everyone well wherever you are on this Big C journey.",
