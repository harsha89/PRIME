I started again two weeks ago plus my first Herceptin infusion which went without a hitch. So I only have four more sessions of Taxol to go. I'm not feeling great ...very tired,headache (?sinuses) and generally not very well. I should admit to being 74 and so older than most of you here. I have to accept that I won't 'bounce back' so easily but am beginning to wonder if it's all worth it. I can only hope I can continue to have Herceptin. I have been given Ramipril to help .I am feeling rather defeated today. My husband is manfully holding the fort.....! My cancer was Her+ Grade 2 with one lymph node involved.",

      "Content": "Hello everyone. Please excuse a whinge from a seventy-ish year old patient . I went for a final mammogram in December because I thought it was the right thing to do. Oh dear ! This led to biopsies ,ultrasound, CAT scan .MRI and a mastectomy . Results showed the tumour to be lobular grade 2 Her2 positive. Oh dear again . To cut a long story short I had 12 infusions of Taxol and I have had 3 Herceptins. My echocardiogram showed 50%. I have been taking Ramipril and have a second echocardiogram before I continue. What is worrying me is what happens if I can't have any more Herceptin. Has anyone else been taken off the Wonderdrug ? Also two weeks after finishing Taxol I am still feeling pretty exhausted and pathetic and down in the dumps. Ihad a second MRI two weeks ago and am not getting those results till the end on June. They wanted a second MRI because the MDM couldn't agree whether a tiny spot was a met or not. How does everyone else cope ? (I am aware that nearly all of you are much younger than I am. So I apologise for that......Old people get scared too ! )",
