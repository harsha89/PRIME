    "Content": "Hi Sharindashar, I wondered if A) the sickness, nausea, fatigue and chemo fog has gone away, and B) if they ever got to the bottom of why you felt this was so long after chemo? The reason I ask is that my dad finished chemo 3 months ago and in the last week he been feeling these exact symptoms, didn't feel bad during chemo, only slightly more tired than usual but nothing drastic, but now he is feeling absolutely terrible, worse than he did before treatment started.Â  Thankyou LeeBee89",
