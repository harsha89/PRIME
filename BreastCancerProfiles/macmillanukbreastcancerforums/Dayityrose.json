So went from stage 2 to stage 3. I had left mastectomy and 15 rads. Now on anastrazole for 5 years 1 year down 4 to go.  Part way through my chemo my T6 in my spine collapsed I'm still in a lot of pain with that. Then in nov 2016 i started to feel very unwell i had the shakes my temp was all over the place i was feeling really down  my ancles began to swell i was paniking so saw my doc he asked me my symptoms and then said he was going to check my thyroid the results came back and YEY HO levothyrocin for the rest of my life. So when im ill my temp is all over the place i cant take medication because it can have an adverse affect because of the levothyrocin.in Feb of this year wI saw my consultant because of bone ache and pains in my knees he made an appointment for me to have a nuclear bone scan and in the meantime told me to take ibuprofen for the pain well that wasn't a wise move cos 3 days later I was on the manor ward as my heart rate was erratic so had to stop that too. Well the cancer hadn't spread but my knees have atheritis in them and I now walk with a stick. I still have pain doc has now put me on cocodamol for the pain. 2 years ago I was as healthy as a butcher's dog i am now a old mare ready for the knackers yard.  Then you get called in for a poxy interview to preform like a monkey. The one thing I have learned since having cancer is I do not suffer fools gladly and this idiotic so called MEDICAL PROFECIONAL WILL EXPERIENCE MY WRATH. Hugs xxxx",
