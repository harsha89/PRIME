      "Content": "Hi Rhonda Â  I understand exactly what you are going through. I am 48 and was put on Tamoxefen after treatment, The hot flushes have been ruining my life and I can safely say that they have been the worst s/e out of any of the treatment. Mostly because you dont know how long you will have them for. I was given clonidine and although it did help I found that it prevented me sleeping. With the hot flushes and night sweats I was adding slleping tablets into the mix to counteract the tablets I was taking for anothe s/e. My doctor has been great and I am on gabapentin now. I must admit to being quite wary about taking this due to the long list of s/e however I havent had any of them and it does seem to be cutting down the number of flushes I am having. What I'm trying to say is if the clonidine doesnt suit don't despair you may find other things work as well. I am also on oil of evening primrose which I have been told helps Lots of hugs Susy",

      "Content": "Hi Sophie, Its worth checking your mums bank account to see if it covers travel insurance. Both myself and husband have chronic conditions and are covered, I also have a friend who has a very seroius blood disorder and cannot get any insurance however her bank still covers. You do have to inform them but it is worth looking into. My bank is Lloyds but I'm sure the other banks have similar on some of their accounts. Best of luck with this and I hope your mum has a lovely trip. xxx",

      "Content": "Hi Nicola I haven't been on line for a few days so just picked up your thread. I have almost mirrored your experiences with my rashes coming up shortly after a few days away in Devon and looking like severe sunburn after my first docetaxel. I was advised to take piriton and ranatidine and given a mild steroid cream to reduce the rash. An additional cream that I tried was an antihistamine cream which really did help with the itching so that may be worth trying. This time around they have reduced the dose so I'm keeping my fingers crossed this time around. Good luck on the next one lots of hugs Susy",

      "Content": "Hi All I am just coming to the end of my treatment now for a 6cm lobular tumor with 4 pos nodes. I started with a mastectomy then 3 X FEC and 3 X Taxotare and I am have now finished 15 of my 25 radiotherapy sessions. Previously I thought that I had no risk factors except being female. I hardly drink, I dont smoke and thought I had limited family history. I am 47 years old. I have just found out that my supposed limited family history is untrue and unfortunately my mother decided that it would not be a good idea to tell me as she did not want to frighten me. I have found out that on my fathers side out of the possible 4 family lines 3 have had breast cancer under 50 and the fourth we do not know about. What I am really scared about is whether my treatment would have been different had the clinicians known about this? I am terrified of a return of this and due to my bodies reaction to chemo do not think I could do this again. Does anyone have any info on this. I am getting some genetic testing done but have to wait for this. Thanks everyone SusyG",

      "Content": "Thank you both for your advice and encouragement. I think one of my cousins has a family tree but how much detail that has in it regarding cause of death I dont know. I know for instance that one of my aunts died in her early 40's from a brain tumour and her daughter at 48 of breast cancer. Had my aunt lived longer would she have been a victim of BC? It seems funny that from my mums research of her side of the family tree I know that one of my ancestors was the first woman prisoner in the tower of London but I dont know the fate of some of my cousins on my fathers side! Thanks again SusyG",

      "Content": "Hi all. I have recently been diagnosed with invasive lobular cancer and am terrified that i have messed up in trying to get it sorted. After finding the lump (which I should have found earlier as its quite visible) I immediately went to the GP who refered me to the brest clinic. After telling my husband we decided to see if we could speed up the diagnosis by having the mammogram, ultrasound and core biopsy done privately so within 1.5 weeks had the diagnosis - great! I thought now at least knowing the news was bad I could move forward, how wrong I was! After a visit with the breast nurse and discussions around immediate reconstruction I discovered that my hospital only did the back reconstruction which I really didnt want. I was referred to a hospital about 40min away to see a consultant for DIEP reconstruction. After waitiong 2 weeks for an appointment I finally saw the consultant who told me that I should never been refered and that they would not advis at all with the cancer diagnosis I have and the results of the biopsy and that I needed to contact the original hospital and ask for an urgent date for the mastectomy with axilla clearout. After 3 and a half weeks I still have no date, no knowledge of if the lymph nodes have any cells and loosing confidence with the system - feeling very scared",

      "Content": "Hi Everyone I just wanted everyone like me who had lost confidence that it does work. I had the mastectomy last week and thank goodness I didn't have a recon. I think I became the wards most awkward patient with crashing blood pressure and numerous other complications. I am finally out now and have a very attentive GP who phones every day and has been sending district nurses in and next Tuesday I get the dreaded. The whole procedure was a nightmare but the team that has looked after me have been fantastic and have restored my faith completely. The process has taught me an awful lot and although I am still very scared I do have confidence that I will be getting the best treatment. My latest issue is that my daughter now has chicken pox - I would just like the problems one time at a time and am wondering what is going to happen next. Thanks again everyone for your support and keep the faith! SusyG xxxxxxxx",

      "Content": "Hi All, I just wanted to thank you all for the support and experiences that you have had. I finally had another appointment with the consultant at the original hospital yesterday. She didnt really give me any answers as to why the wild goose chase to the other unit for immediate recon and my husband thought it best not to go into. - As he rightly said \"she will be the one wielding the knife in the op\" Now going for full MX starting with 3 nodes to be removed. I must admit to not being reconciled with the body image side and I dont think I will - I dont have great boobs but I've had them a fair while and am quite attached. Finally got a date through for next Thursday. Its quite outside the guidelines but I suppose everyone starts this journey at a different place anyway. I hate all the waiting though! It will be another 10 days i have been told after the op before I will have any clearer picture and know if I have to have chemo. Like Blue Tit I lost my job in November yes it has private health care, critical illness insurance the lot and because as the government tells us to do, I put some savings by to suppliment my rubbish pension I am only able to claim Â£71 per week. As the major wage earner in the family with one just going to Uni and another 16 year old ie 4 adults to feed in the family I am cross that all my contributions since aged 16 amount to nothing. I really shouldnt have saved! I really want to get back to work but obviously not even knowing how long the treatment is going to be makes it difficult. On the positive side my job was very stressful and chances are I would have put off going to the Dr -some things are meant to be. I am now decieding that unless you have the bad times in life - you never will recognise the good. This experience is showing me all the fantastic family, friends, neighbours and people like yourselves who dont even know me but are still with me. I agree I am going to fight this tooth and nail whether in body, spirit or supporting the further research. I have found a new activity on the Wii fit - boxing. The end part allows you to bash the target as much as you like. - its becoming my favourite activity. Sorry to ramble best wishes Susy",
