      "Content": "Hi Mary Jane, I have just written you a long chatty reply but lost it as I am so appalling at all this so here is a short one. I am sure you have found out by now that it is three weeks. For me this means 16th March, 6th April, 27th April etc however it is very hard to plan anyhting as I found out this week  - see my other post - one never knows which side effect is going to hit you when though apart from the infection I have been very lucky and the nausea in particular was really well managed through the medication. The white blood cell count however was not so good. If it does not get up enough then I will have to change my date which will throw out all plans I would like to make - I find this one of the most frustrating aspects of the whole inconvenience as you call it and so does my everso well - organised 15 year old who cannot rely on me to fetch and carry her to all the things that we used to do together. It is so annoying and hard when it effects them so directly. Anyway I hope you can still do your long weekend but as my family and friends keep warning me - don't do too much, be careful and look after yourself. I find it hard to follow that advice but you should!!!! Skippy Fudge (not such a short reply after all)",

I start on 16th March and know that it is just something that I have to get on with but all your advice and honesty will help, I am sure. Your story is very similar to mine, Clair;  found the lump around the 15th Jan and it has been a roller coaster ever since. I still feel like it is all happening to someone else not me. Perhaps the chemo will be when it all becomes real. Keep smiling and take care.  ",

      "Content": "So first chemo went really well - good veins etc. A little cold with the e part (the pink one) but a nice warm pad helped enormously. The nausea didn't hit until three hours later just as we were getting home - the joy of living in the remote West of Scotland - but the dopremadole? (not going to go and check) was very effective I found and got rid of that quickly. Home to bed - children pleased to see me back and apparently little changed - not sure if they thought that was good though! The next week was fine, I thought, I even managed to pop into work briefly and have some kids here to rehearse. This was a mistake I think as by Wednesday I had a temperature and had to be admitted to hospital as neutropenic. So many IV antibiotics that I had never heard of before and strict isolation from all other patients. I had always rather fancied a side ward but it is so boring not being able to use other patients to lighten the stay. Oban Hosp staff  were great and they looked after me very well but I hope (and I'm sure I won't if I am careful) that I don't go through that again next time. I came out yesterday and the sun is shining here today and I feel good - til next time on this momentous train journey...........I hope that they can find a vein at next chemo in this rather battered left arm.",

      "Content": "Hi, I have just had my last chemo 10days ago and it has gone very quickly. As the Fox says do browse this site to find advice more suited to your situation. My children are alot older at 12 and 15 and the problems for them and for me are different but it is still a question of doing what you can when you can and making the most of those times. The second half of each chemo session I used to go into school to teach so I see no reason why at that time you will not have the energy to be involved and avctive in your son's care and though you will have to take it easier and be more careful in the first half of the session - the first 10 days - I am sure the Macmillan staff and your chemo staff will be able to give you advice. At least you can lie with him and read stories or watch TV etc with your daughter. As the Fox says take as much support and help as is offered and treasure the times that you feel up to being active with the children - time will pass quickly - though some bits feel very slow and if all goes as planned hopefully you will have had some very laid back times with the children. Just try and be sure someone else is there when you are feeling more weak. I do hope it all goes smoothlly - take care.",
