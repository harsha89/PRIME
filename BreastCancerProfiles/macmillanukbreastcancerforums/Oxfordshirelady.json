I know millions have been through it but I really am dreading starting next week. Thanks for the tip though- I'll make sure I call if I start being sick.

I'm also glad that you've got a friend going with you today. It really is true that when we are going through things like cancer you get a real chance to evaluate the relationships we have. At a time like this you really need people round you giving off positive energy that can give you the support needed at thus time. I don't know the full extent of your circumstances but I have picked up quite a bit from your posts. Please dig deep if need be and find at least one person that can provide emotional support. I know that there are lots of women on this site that care about you but it would be great if you had someone close by. Perhaps it's this friend that's going with you. Please take care and know that there are a whole load of people thinking of you. Nikki xxx",

      "Content": "Hi Lola, Happy new year to you too! I am sorry that you have to have a mastectomy. I have had mine the other way round. I had a mastectomy on November 30th and I start my chemo on the 10th. I was also very nervous before I had the surgery and did my best to do things to distract me including having a holiday the week before. I would advise button tops if possible. I did manage to get a few tops over my head but initially I needed a lot of help as my arm on the side that I had the mastectomy was rather painful to move. I'm sure the nurse will be able to advise you better when you meet. i also had to go and buy a few wireless bras beforehand as i was told wired would be painful. I was able to wear the bra two days after surgery. I have a temporary implant in place that is not quite the same size as my unaffected breast so they gave me a sponge thing ( can't remember what it's called) to fill the rest of the bra. I have however only needed it to use it for two days as I have had Seroma which has more than filled the space that's left. I am having reconstruction after treatment. I initially found the drains really scary and I was rather nervous about pulling them out accidentally but I got through it somehow. I have had a few issues with Seroma and cording that have restricted my arm movement for sometime but things are getting better. I hope I have said something that you find useful. Please feel free to ask anymore questions. Good luck for next week. I'm sure you'll be fine. Nikki x",

      "Content": "Hi, not really sure if I should say welcome. But not great timing regarding diagnosis. I feel very new to this so i hope I'm not saying the wrong thing. i can tell you what my experience has been but above all else please remember everyones case is different even when diagnosed with the same type of breast cancer. I was diagnosed with DCIS initially and told i would need a lumpectomy then after further tests I was told it was invasive. In addition I was told that I had a large area covered with calcification which combined together would necessitate a mastectomy. I was diagnosed on October 25th. I chose to go off to South Africa two weeks later on a work trip and then a weeks leave. It had been planned for a long while and my boyfriend who lives in Australia - another story- was also joining me. I had a wonderful time! Why am I telling you all this? In the hope you will be able to try and put the diagnosis behind you between now and the new year. It will be hard at times but try and enjoy this time. I had my mastectomy on the 30th of November and I'm recovering with a few issues. I start chemo on 10th January. FEC-T. I have a temporary implant in place which has helped me a great deal. I am as yet uncertain if I will have radiotherapy. This will be decided later. Reconstruction is planned for when all my treatment is done. As I said at the beginning I'm not sure if I'm right in telling you my experience to date. I still have a long way to go. More than anything the support from friends and family and even my boyfriend who's so far away have kept my spirits up. In the short while I have been on this forum I have seen loads of support and advice given when you reach out. I think I'll be needing a whole load of support over the coming months and I hope to have the strength to reach out for it. Take care and have as much fun as you can over holiday. Nikki xxx",

      "Content": "Hi everyone/ anyone, I had my mastectomy done on the 30th of november and have a temporary implant in place. I have been doing ok other than seroma. Today is the 5th time I've had it drained. The last time I had it drained before today was last Saturday. It felt like I was going to burst. My skin was so stretched. After it was all drained it looked awful because the skin was so saggy. Now in the space of just over 4 hours I'm almost back to where I was. It's filled up again! I've asked what I'm doing wrong and the answer is nothing. Its also really hard now and unlike before most of the fluid seems to be on one side and not evenly distributed. To crown it all I've now also got some cording under my armpit. When I raise my arm something juts out in my armpit. It feels like my arm is being pulled back and everything is tight up to my elbow. I've been doing my best to remain upbeat but I'm really at my wits end. I'll be keen to know if anyone else has had a similar experience or any advice. My FEC-T is due to start on 10th January and I know if this doesn't settle it may delay the start. :( Nikki x",

My consultant also says its ok but I always wonder if there holding something back. I'm sorry you have to travel so far for treatment. That must be tough.

Regarding the cording, the only bit I can actually feel is in my armpit. Unfortunately with the Christmas period it seems things have slowed down somewhat in my hospital. I have been told just to take aspirin for now. How long have had your cording for? I'm feeling much better than I did earlier. I've had my nails done thus afternoon in a very festive red.

I was shocked and saddened to read about Annabel's passing - so so sad. May her soul rest in perfect peace. My Xmas plans did not go as planned but this may have been a blessing in some ways as I didn't have the time to focus on me. Long story for another day. I just wanted to let everyone know abound Manual Lymphatic Drainage therapy! I had a visit from a therapist on saturday for my cording and the results two days after are amazing. I can now stretch both my arms out straight in front of me. I know it may sound so small but to be able to do this without pain and that tugging sensation is such a relief to me. If you're interested please google it and enter your postcode to find a therapist near you or ask your BCN. The therapist is coming again at the weekend but in the mean time I shall continue my exercises. Going in on Thursday for what I hope will be my last drainage for Seroma - it appears to have slowed down thankfully. A whole load of other appointments before my first FEC next Thursday. I'm scared. I hope 2013 brings you all you wish for but I have to confess I am not looking forward to 2013. I am dreading it in many ways. I want 2013 to be done with and I want it to be 2014. Xxxx",

      "Content": "Hi Keira, When I first had my mastectomy, I had an expander put in and the plan was to go for the DIEP option once all my treatment was completed. I had a few complications which led to me meeting a new surgeon. He talked me out of going for the DIEP option. I also considered the LD Flap but to be honest the back scarring, loss of muscle etc really put me off. (Call me vain!) Before all this I was quite active in the gym. I feared the loss of a back muscle would restrict what I could do going forward.  I had a reduction on my left side and new impant on my right.  However things dont look so great (to me) without clothes - My skin was quite burned following radiotheraphy and one half of my chest is a different shade to the other side. Surgery took place in November and again early December. On the plus side - despite some complications, I'm back to work and back to the gym determined to get off all the extra pounds I've gained. I went for a boxercise class on Tuesday and it felt so good to be able to punch again. I wasn't sure if I would be able to cope with it as I've had lots of problems with my arm since the lymph nodes were removed. I know I've read loads of success stories on the site about women that opted for the DIEP or LD but I am so glad I went with the option I did. Its the least invasive and quickest recovery. I am able to wear pretty much what I want now with my new perkier pair :) The only thing in the way is my portacath which will remain in till May when I finish herceptin. Not sure if that's been of any help. Take your time and weigh up the pros and cons of all the options available and decide which one will impact least on the life you want to live. Nikki x  ",

I had a mastectomy on my right breast at the end of november, just finished chemo and will be starting rads sometime soon. At the moment I have a temporary implant in place and I have agreed with my surgeon that reconstruction will start 3 months after rads. He said this will give time for the skin to heal and for me to have regained all my strength after all the treatment. The reconstruction is on the same breast that I am having my rads. Unless there is another reason he is not clearly stating, the reason given to you is in complete contradiction with all the professionals I have spoken to. A delay in surgery understandable but to say you can't have it ever doesn't sound right to me. Please do everything possible to get a second opinion. Take good care and sending you loads of hugs.
