      "Content": "Hi,  please don't be scared.........  I had Mx and immediate DIEP last July,  it wasn't nearly as bad as I had been told, had the op on thurs, was in a chair on Sat and pacing the floor on Sun,  By Monday I was exploring the hospital and found a nice garden to sit in, luckily the weather was nice.  They told me not to straighten up at first but it really wasnt a problem at all, it hurt my back more to stay bent over.  I went home on wed once the last drain had been taken out.  Once I was home I was my own worst enemy, but if you try to do too much you pay, I learned the hard way.  I was mucking my horse out pretty quickly and back at work after 6 weeks, could have gone back sooner if I could have driven. The new breast is fine I even got a new nipple thrown in at the same time which I wasnt expecting, it will be tattooed to match the other one at some time in the future.  The belly wound broke down a bit and took a long time to heal, but that was probably my own fault for doing too much, the scar isnt nice but a small price to pay I think.  A big bonus is the nice flat tummy which I'm determined is going to stay.  Hope this helps, if you go into it thinking everything will be Ok it will be XXXXXXXXXXX Sharron",
