    "Content": "And of course, if coconut oil or turmeric or whatever the latest fad might be really cured cancer, wouldn't scientists have worked it out and big pharma made money out of it??? Actually they would be losing money because everyone would be fixing themselves at home..  Its has been scientifically proven that lots of fruit and veg have cancer curing properties.. Like carrot juice.. Black seed oil are just two out of hundreds.  Yes we should do what our oncologists say is best for us.. But there is no harm in taking natural things also that can benefit us.. My uncle had stomach cancer and he only took herbal stuff... 30 years on he is fine and well and cancer free.. So not everything is bull****",
