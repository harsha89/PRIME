      "Content": "Hi you folks, I am due to meet with the oncologist soon, and I am going to Asks him to recommend a treatment plan as I agree dream thief, very unfair to out someone in a position of trying to decide about chemo if not an open and shut case. I so feel he will have seen enough cases to advise in his experience what the right thing to do is. I will let you know how I get on! ",

      "Content": "Morning everyone, my head is full of questions as I have my oncology appointment tomorrow! I am writing all down, but just want to try and stay focused and get all the info I need! I had left mastectomy 5 weeks ago, recovering well and surgeon really pleased as he got good margins. He doesn't think I will need radiotherapy for this reason. I am 45, my stage is2, grade3, but no lymph nodes negative and MRi and bone scan also clear. ER positive and will be prescribed tamoxifen. hER2 negative. I had a look at the predictor website, and I know they will input my details tomorrow, but it looks like the benefits of chemo as well as tamoxifen are going to come out as bit borderline! So am scared the Dr will leave the big decision up to me! I plan to ask him what he would recommend if it was his daughter/wife etc, but Drs aren't obliged to answer this really! I feel I have been through such a lot and am reluctant to put my body through more now. Also wondered about what follow up is done  . Any advice from you folks would be much appreciated !! ",

      "Content": "Hi all, I just wondered about how effective anti sickness melds have been ? I am about to do 3rd FEC, and took Ondansetron, along with a steroid, for the first 5 days after chemo. I still felt pretty nauseous, though was only sick once, and I began to wonder how much good they were doing, and if it is worth trying a different drug, just to see? Or maybe it is better just to accept that there will be horrible feelings for the first week or so after?  Would love to hear from others who have maybe had more success with melds? Thank you !",
