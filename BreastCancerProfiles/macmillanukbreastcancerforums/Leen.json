      "Content": "Hi, I've just been diagnosed (yesterday) and am waiting for my date for surgery.  What a lot to take in and learn :(.  My tumour is just behind the nipple and the surgeon would like to remove it along with the tumour but I'd really like to hold on to it if possible.  Has anyone tried to keep the nipple?  I feel if I can keep it I'll still have part of myself, am I focusing too much on this?  I've been told I'll have sentinel node biopsy in the same surgery, followed by radiotherapy and tamoxifen.  I haven't been referred for MRI or CT or had blood tests - is this usual?  So sorry for so many questions but I'm finding searching through all the different postings confusing at this point.  I guess it'll start to make sense soon but I feel as though I have a thousand piece jigsaw in front of me!  Many thanks. ",

      "Content": "Thanks so much for you responses and I've been able to read through the information this morning and actually take it in.  Yesterday was a bit of a haze to say the least!   Thanks for the link to nipple reconstruction Karen,  I think I'd like to see what a nipple reconstruction looks like to help me make that decision so I've asked my nurse and she's going to find some clinical pics and a buddy for me. I guess I could Google but who knows what results I'll get from a 'tattooed nipple' search :). George and Jackie, thanks for the heads-up re possible changes to the treatment - I guess they can only plan for what they can see now which is the best case scenario.  I can't believe that today I'm hoping that I only have what I've been told so far.  I've spoken to the nurse about the MRI and they don't feel it's needed in my case.  Obviously I am now thinking  that every cough means it's spread to the lungs, every ache means it's gone to the bones but I need to stop that.  Reading what others have gone through puts that sort of imagining into perspective!  Lynned6, it's looks like I have what you've got, grade 2 and I hope I get the same results from the lymph nodes.  I'll look on FB to try and find some local groups (I've looked at Macmillam but there was nothing) my hospital is in Guildford which has quite a large cancer centre so I would hope there's something but I haven't been able to find anything yet.  Bev, it's very encouraging to see you (and Lynned6) have gone through so much and got through to the other side.  Interesting to hear you don't mind the loss of the nipple so much now.  I suppose if it comes down to being cancer free or keeping a cancerous nipple the choice is pretty clear! Thank you all for your responses and support and I'll try not to post at midnight again when my head is full of horrible thoughts.   Good luck and I hope everything goes well for you all.   L xxx",

Bunglesabout, were your pains related to the bone marrow injections?  I think that's what made me feel worse.  I hope your next one goes better - you're right with the advice  to seek help as soon as any side effect becomes difficult.   Birty and Debbie, I'm booked in for a PICC line next week because my veins are in hiding but think I may insist they just keep stabbing me every time instead. Does anyone know if you have to be hooked to an IV  for Herceptin treatment?  This will go on for a year so I need to factor that into any decision I make.   Hope you're all having a decent day Lee x",

Suffering from yucky heartburn so can't lie down and have a belly the size of a whale because I'm not peeing but apart from that it went ok.   I feel stupid for saying this but I have been terribly down because of hair loss.  I tolerated the cold cap really well but by day 14 of the first cycle my hair was coming out in clumps and is now around 60% gone.  I had the cold cap again today but a lot of my hair came out when I took the cap off :(   I know so many of you ladies have faced this full on and shaved your head and accepted the inevitable but I m really struggling. My hair was fabulous, my one good feature and without it I feel my confidence has been stripped to nothing.  I've started wearing the wig but the soreness of my head and the itching make it uncomfortable so I'm actually pleased that I'll be mostly at home for the next week.  I did the Look Good Feel Better course last week and that helped for a day. I can't bear the thought it's going to take me years to get back my crowning glory and have no guarantee it'll ever be the same again.  I hope I've still got something to hang on to until the end - even if it's just a few strands of 'me'. How weird that this has become the biggest focal point when I had so many other side effects last time and am probably about to face them all again in the coming week    Oh dear, what a self indulgent rant, I blame it on the middle of the night and chemo day.    Hope you're all doing well and there are not too many nasties side effects out there.

I was given T first which took about 90 - 120 mins, had saline flushed through and then had the C injected slowly into the cannula.  I felt fine afterwards and for the first couple of days.   Days 3 - 10 weren't great. I had an elevated temp but not over 38 so I didn't go in to hospital. This may have been related to a sore throat I'd had in the previous week rather than the treatment. On the up side I didn't eat very much so managed to lose a couple of pounds. I was unlucky on day 10 with intense chest pain and did have  to go in for one night - I think they were overly cautious because of my history.  I underwent every test under the sun and was given the all clear and was fine the next day. This is not common and was specific to me.   From day 11 I have felt 'normal'. - I continue to get side effects but all are much more manageable than I expected.   I didn't drive on my bad days because I felt unwell but since then it's been life as normal except I'm not  mixing too much with lots of people as I really don't want any sort of infection. Unfortunately I can still operate a vacuum cleaner and do the washing! Good luck for tomorrow and let me know how you get on   Lee x  ",

No real problems so far, the only difference I noticed was my temp and pulse went down for a few days.  I only had to wait around for 2 hours afterwards - thank goodness it wasn't 6.  The main things are to be sure the Herceptin is at room temp and that it goes in slowly. I was a bit apprehensive beforehand so am a pretty relieved it went ok.   Karin, where is your pain?  I have pain in the tummy/back/pelvis with the bone marrow injections - is this what you're talking about? Apart from that I'm looking forward to getting passed day 9 so I can relax (that was the day I was hospitalised last time). Lee x",

I checked the stats and there is no greater incidence of BC in UK towns and cities compared to rural areas.  It's marginally more prevalent in the most affluent but maybe because they get checked more?  Those in deprived areas have a lower incidence.  I will take a deeper breath when I read the next report - I just wish they wouldn't broadcast on the news as though it is fact.  We have enough to deal with without feeling it's somehow our fault.   Lee x ",

(lots of people seem to get on well with it) or maybe try other brands of Exemestane (my first pack was Pfizer).  If you\u2019re finding it too much to have to make this decision at this moment then perhaps postpone until radiotherapy is over.  You may feel more able to deal with it then.  All the best Lee ",

I've also been avoiding people recently because I can't stand being told how well I look and how I can now start getting back to 'normal'   In addition my boyfriend died suddenly in July and my first grandchild was born in October - talk about a mad roller coaster of emotions!   I'm sorry I don't have any real answers but know you're not alone feeling this way.  One thing that has helped me was meeting with a group of breast cancer survivors last week - it helped to see that people do move on, hair grows back and lives can be rebuilt.  I'm not sure what area you're in but if you're anywhere near Surrey message me and I can give you details or meet up for a moan.  Also I do still feel the extreme tiredness is not quite as bad as it was two weeks ago when I finished rads. Good luck and big hugs  Lee x  ",

      "Content": "Hi Margym,  I had my op 5 weeks ago and had a build up of blood and fluid in the breast (haematoma and seroma).   My breast had a very bruised appearance which looked almost like a port wine stain in places and was sore and heavy.  i did start to bleed from the scar from the end of week 2 and had to go back several times for the blood to be removed (not as bad as it sounds).  5 weeks on I'm not in pain but still have bruising, a haematoma that can't now be aspirated which I have been told will absorb into my body over the next few weeks/months.   I'm worried that you say yours is very painful - mine was sore and uncomfortable but not as painful as the lymph area under my armpit.  If your breast feels hot or you get a fever then call your BC nurse immediately in case of infection.  If your BC nurse is as useless as mine it may be worth seeing your GP for reassurance if you still have a while before your follow-up with the surgeon.   Good luck and hope you feel better soon  Lee x",
