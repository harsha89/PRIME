      "Content": "Well had the sub- cut injection of herceptin this afternoon ( after a 2 hr wait- so miss having health care at home!!) and all went really well. Took around 90 seconds to administer and then a wait of 60mins to ensure no side affects. Have to agree with Jane that it was far better than IV as virtually no pain at all, just the usual prick of the needle you feel... Hopefully next time I will not have to wait around so long afterwards.",

      "Content": "Hi , I am going from IV herceptin to herceptin via injection as of tomorrow. I have been told that it will be injected into my thigh and will take a couple of minutes to administer - question I have is does it hurt or give you a numb feeling? I am not a fan of injections but as I will now be on herceptin for life it will be far more convenient for me not having the PICC line but a tad worried it will be painful Any advice as to what I could do to prep myself will be great fully received Kim x",

      "Content": "Hi Geera You made me chuckle when read your reply - had a vision of a giant syringe heading towards me!! I have been told that I have to remain to 1 hr after the injection incase there are any side affects. Also the dosage is the same for everyone irrespective of your height and weight! At the QE in Birmingham where I go they have only just started the injections so will be one of the first ones transferring over ... Will let you know how it goes tomorrow x",
