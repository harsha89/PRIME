      "Content": "thank you lovely ladies for taking the time to reply. Your words have helped enormously (even though I'm crying as I read and now type) I think that as was suggested it's not depression, more emotion, I was crying at the tv last night. My husband is great at practical support, but not with emotional support, he doesn't know what to do so he puts his blinkers on and ignores the tears.  Also a number of friends have said how 'well' I'm dealing with BC , maybe after 5 months of 'dealing' with it it's time to be honest about how scared and frightened I am.  Thank you Sue xx",

      "Content": "Hi, I have been on anti depressants some some years now. When I was told that I would be taking Tamoxifen I was given a leaflet. amongst all the blurb was a section on what drugs react to Tamoxifen. On the list was the anti depressant that I was on. I went to my GP, showed them the info, they did some investigating and changed my drug to Citalopram. I have been on the Tamoxifen for about 3 weeks now, last week I got very very weepy but I'm feeling better again with each day.  Hope you get on okay   Sue",

      "Content": "afternoon all, I have decided that I DO need some support on my journey and that I'm not as strong as family and friends think I am. I was diagnosed with breast cancer with my first mamogram last October. I had lumpectomies on both breasts in November. Found out the Friday before Christmas that I had to have a mastectomy on the right hand side, this was done approx three weeks ago with reconstruction. At the moment I have an un-inflated implant and fluid build up which will be drained for the second time on Friday. I am a larger busted woman - 42F - and am now getting increasingly concerned that the new breast will not be anywhere near the size of my old one.... does anybody else have any advice on this?",

I have today seen the plastic surgeon who has given reassurance that I won't be left looking as uneven as I'm imagining and has said that we can discuss reducing the size of my remaining breast when the time comes.  Off to Addenbrookes on tuesday for my first meet with the radiology team, get measured up, tattooed and hopefully start that very soon.",

I am 52 and three weeks ago did not have a grey hair on my head, now all of a sudden I've got a virtual 'Mallen Streak' appearing, it's really quite noticably changing on a daily basis. I'm quite intrigued atm to see how far it goes ! My question is , has this happened to anyone else on Tamoxifen? I know that greying quickly can be put down to stress, but I was diagnosed end of September, would of thought that's when I would of gone grey, not now 6 months down the line. Was wondering if it was an unusual side effect of the drug.....or it's just me? Hope you all had a warm weekend indoors !! Sue x",

      "Content": "I had a mastectomy on my RHS in January and finished my rad treatment on my LHS a couple of weeks ago. Today I had my appointment with the plastic surgeon to start the inflation process on the right. My original size was 42F, I was told from the begining that they couldn't make the new breast that big, which was fine as the existing breast had had a big section removed and was a different size anyway! The Dr said don't worry, we won't leave you very uneven, we can always do a reduction on the left one.  Today he tells me that I cannot have a reduction because of the rad treatment , apparently skin doesn't heal very well where it's been treated.  I feel very emotional, let down, I know I should be grateful to be here and to of got over the worse but now I know I'll never look anywhere near 'normal' again. I was told not to worry, I could use a 'chicken fillet' to balance out.   My husband thinks I'm making a fuss 'over nothing'  ...... maybe I am....",
