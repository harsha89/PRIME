      "Content": "Hi there. I am not sure whether I am ER or HER. They may have told me on Tuesday but I obviously did not take it in and I don't have any paperwork. From my original consultation after the biopsy the letter to my doctor said my cancer was grade 1 and appeared to be hormone sensitive. At my follow up I was told that there was no need for any further surgery and, as originally indicated at my first appointment this would be followed up by radiotherapy for a three week intensive period and five years of hormone treatment so thankfully I don't need chemotherapy. My healing and scar were looked at as the dressing was removed then too. After this meeting I was told to wait in the waiting room to be called to see the oncologist and after about 45 minutes after asking the receptionist, someone came to tell me that the oncologist that I needed to see was not physically in the building hence the delayed appointment and extended angst. So, knowing this, what sort of questions do you think it would be useful to ask? Thanks.",

      "Content": "Hello. It is me again. After my follow up appointment on Tuesday when I could not see the oncologist who will organise my radiotherapy and hormone treatment I am now booked to see him next Wednesday. I have been told to come armed with the questions that I want to ask but I really don't know what to ask so I just wanted to know the sorts of things other people asked at this stage? Any suggestions? Thank you",
