Hope you are resting today. Don;t do too much too soon - let people cook and pamper you and collect hugs from anyone who offers :) I'm day ummm 9 !! I have so much swelling in my lady boy boob I think my body is regrowing a boob - ha that will teach u for stealing mine. Jokes apart it doesn't hurt, is a build of lymphocytes as obviously i had level 2 axilliary clearance. Been advise to not exercise so much as this may increase it but if you stay static you stiften so find a balance. ishing you a speedy recovery and hope you are feeling so much better today - btw I think you were incredibly brave - nerve pain is nothing to be brave and suffer about it;s nasty xoxox Shelley , good luck with your mx, my experience was nothing like poor Polly cat's - it was pain free and simple , just lost bloods and fluids as clearly i'm a bleeder lol :) Check out the other feeds where we have all been writing our experiences - it is unique to everyone, but mostly we all say it's not as bad as you imagine :) Sassy xoxoxo",

      "Content": "Hey Highland Mum,  Firstly good luck - are you joining us on the FEC cocktail ?? What can I say - expect the things you like to not like ...LOL - I was a tea addict and I can't bare it now, nor coffee. You will need to find a drink you like, my first treatment lemon & lime fizzy water was the best thing ever, 2nd treatment even smelling it made me feel sick.  Fruit juices are working for me and milkshake this second cycle.  Didn't have any problems with sore mouth touch wood so far, but Difflam is a great mouthwash. For the first few days as I'm nauseaous on first day only, anti sickness take that away for next few days but I have no appetite and jaw gets tired chewing - yes, really...I stick to Ritz, crackers, digestive biscuits and then add toast in ...once I get hungrier and move away from cardboard diet - it's whatever I fancy really and you will discover the mad chemo cravings - mine are savoury, former biscuit addict not interested in biscuits/ cakes or chocolate lol  It's really individual - some people have really bad symptoms and others mild, mine really aren't too bad it's a weird thing to describe it's not as bad as a violent stomach bug or flu ...it's managable and it wears off quite quickly.  Best advice - go with whatever happens and be safe in the knowldege by day 10 latest you'll feel normal and able to do most things. It hasn't really floored me, I carry on driving and getting about throughout. Just have 2 days (then days when steriods end) that I feel more chemo foggy and tired so I rest more.  Just listen to your body and go with the flow- come and ask questions if need be we are all in it together...oooh constipation got me the first cycle as hadn't eaten much, meds bung you up and chemo itself - so used lactulose that works. Drink as much as you can. Heartburn has been a bugger for me this time- so using gaviscon... ummmm anything else - just holla :) ",

      "Content": "Hola everyone, Weight gain with breast cancer treatments is scarily true with 28lbs being the average - yikes especially when you don't think you've been eating !! Then further weight gain with Tamoxifen is very common. This is not starting off very positive is it ??  I gained 9kg about 18lbs on chemo largely from the bloat and swelling the steroids encourage and it's coming off now from really sensible eating, slight calorie reduction and more activity. I'm 7 weeks past chemo, I've cut out rubbish foods and save them as treats - have increased exercise from 30 mins walking every day to include sessions of Zumba that I've built up to 60 mins twice a week. You have to want to do this and get a routine and that isn't always easy if you have aches or feel tired, every day is different, but exercise is proven to improve fatigue, so increasing it by 10 mins a day or every few days is a good way to build up stamina.  Like Dorothee has said you need a combination of diet and exercise to crack this. To crack the Tamoxifen weight gain curse is going to be a bit of hard work sorry. The weight we gained on chemo is pure fat too, so really combined exercise and healthy eating should strip this over time. None of these short term crazy diets or starvation or your body will hang on to it. We need 150 mins of exercise per week to make a difference , so 30 mins a day will help, and we also need to start adding in some resistance training too, not just for bone density stuff, but to boost our metabolic rate.  It's frustrating and a bit insulting to have gone through all the treatment , lose bits and bobs and then gain weight. Grrrr I'm hoping to shake all chemo weight before I start Tamoxifen. I think it's stick with it Enquire about GP Referral for personal trainers to help or find a Cancer Survivorship Fitness Programme in your area. Do wii fitness with friends or join a walking group or swim. Dance around the house, tap your toes when you sit still and fidget !! Move it move it is helps and kick the rubbish food to the kerb. Good luck xx ",

Prior to my mx & axilliary clearance my largest tumour was in my lymph node - I had 2 others in my breast, they thought at that point they were a grade 2, let's see what tomorrow brings.  I will be back with my results tomorrow and treatment plan- all I can say is that I have the same apprehension that I did before my first diagnosis after all the bone scans and CT scans and MRI and you worry where it's spread to It's normal to feel shocked by the results and they will settle down and you'll carry on fighting as I will, It's normal for us to feel we need to be positive and strong for everyone including ourselves but also feel vulnerable and scared, why wouldn't we ? We are human !!  I know this isn't the kind of reply you wanted and chicks who are further down the road will step in where I can't but just to say I hear you and know where you are at.

Waiting isn't a problem - why be in a rush for pain, discomfort and restrictions ?? I'm planning to live it up until they pull me back in and either strap me down and cut me open or start chemo When you think about it - cancer cells however aggressive don't grow that quickly so another couple of weeks makes no difference to my health - i'd much prefer that they researched and considered the best option. I trust my surgeon so I'm not worried. Plus he gave me permission to exercise - so he's my saviour right now :) Pollycat  thank you ...I'm just a crazy fool and not changing that for anything or anyone :) Sue : )  I'm avoiding the ooooohhh soooo sorrry texts still and the have you heard anything more ? Fook me I only went yesterday - talk about people don't have a clue what you are going thru. Was it Ronan Keating who sang ...you say it  best when u say nothing at all - that might be my facebook status for today lol...don't feel like you have to just like anything i say because you feel sorry for me - why are you even feeling sorry for me ?? LOL It's amazeballs !! My son is going paintballing tomorrow, I should go as a sniper and shoot down all the 'i know you said don;t contact me but  pushy ooh i'm sorry people ...calm down it;s only a thought and paint lol  Yup I'm afraid the green tinge is still present so avoiding people for a few days more is the answer, not you lovely people but as Little My says - the head tilters.

      "Content": "Hey everyone , Thanks for well wishes - well today was unusual. I'm not sure what I really feel as yet, i've felt angry at BC, scared a bit and them crazily distracted laughing with friends all evening - which is what I needed to do. Told wider group of friends to give me space, accepted texts but even felt annoyed by the omg i'm sorry's there..be sorry for cancer whose ass i'm kicking , not me !!  Ok, so my post anx clearance & mx results aren't great but hey they are workable and there are others of us with worse scenarios so just taking it in my stride. Considering my lymph was the biggest mass he didn't really say too much - thankfully that's not transporting itself about my body for now and apologies to anyone else that has this worry - i'm not being insensitive. As typically expected I'm an unusual soul for my surgeon, the invasive nature of my breast tumours meant they had actually managed to get into my muscle and so my surgeon is unsure what the severity is of that, however he is researching the best option and will get back to me. One option is they reopen (yuk) my mx and go in and remove my muscle tissue too, which apparent in the past was a standard procedure. He feels I'm young and need the most appropriate treatment - I agree. Of course it's a grade 3 -I almost laugh at that , as if you actually knew me and how in your face i am you say no surprise there !!  2 option was using radiotherapy alongside chemo - he said my seroma needs to clear up before that can happen, it's reduced considerable though. - hmmm deep fried breasts :) Referral to Oncology for chemo - of course, expected within 2-3 weeks, but possibly they may operate again first. I'm sure she said they don't use FEC -T and use CMF after FEC but don't quote me as not spoken to oncology yet .  Is he worried ? I'm not sure, he is perplexed for sure, said he will get back to me within 10 days or so and to get back exercising - that made me happy !! I'm going to kick the c*** out of pads this week :)  My nurse keeps telling me I'm in shock or denial - I'm really not !! But I'm just the way I am. My beginnings of cording is crap, so need to work harder on my stretches and lengthening exercises and referral to physio.Hormone tests not back with regards to HR2 but other two positive so Tamoxifem coming. What can I say, I'm going to cost the NHS a lot of money and when friends ask what i'm doing this summer to brag about their sunny hols, I'll be like well, I'm taking a good period of work with lots of rest and sleep,  i'll be drinking lots, laying in the warm and experimenting with cocktails ...plus I'm having a style makeover ...and they will be jealous of me !!  Laughter can cure anything :)  Sweet dreams lovely ladies, tomorrow is another day ",

      "Content": "Hi Mal It sounds to me you are giving yourself a hard time too with the 'shoulds' There is no rhyme or reason to how you will feel after being diagnosed, or undergoing treatment. Everyone responds to treatment differently and it doesn't make anyone a weaker person if they struggle or stronger if they plough through. There is no comparison and all that matters is that you look after yourself and do what you can that suits your capabilities. So, give yourself a break and go with the flow, some people are totally exhausted by radiotherapy and yes, you are right others do work through it, but they aren't you. The experience of cancer is different for us all, I'm one the annoyingly bubbly ones, but then my role is helpful too, it hopefully supports others that find that more difficult. We can't be up all the time, there are aspects of the diagnosis that affect us, some aspects we find more difficult others we can accept, but we are all different. There is no timescale of when you are supposed to feel better and no deadlines - although sometimes financial ones appear - yuk You aren't alone and there is support out there, as well as the forum, BCC offers Moving Forward courses and information about when treatment ends. Also give yourself time - it's only been 4 months or so, you need to let your head and body catch up with what you've been through Have a relaxing day- spoiling yourself if you can xx",

My experience of Tax hasn't been so bad, sure it's tired me out, but no feet or hand peeling,I had a brief 24 hours in hosp on my first one but wasn't ill just high temp and antibiotics as a precaution. Bone and joint pain sure but I didn't take any pain killers apart from 1st lot. Sure I have fatigue and on my last one had low mood that lasted a week but it passes. .

What to some maybe excessive is normal to others, prior to diagnosis I was like an athlete so what I want to get back to maybe excessive to some but not for others. I'm not sure I agree with that statement too as look at Lance Armstrong - he's not had re-occurrence and trains professionally. Do what you can do :) Breast Cancer has no rhyme or reason, I didn't meet any criteria to have it or not to have it :) I was fit, exercising, relatively young and no family history. I think it's a simple balanced diet, like your dietician said, little treats , no point going through this to be miserable on macrobiotics that can't prove it will keep it at bay. Exercise for health benefits, bone density, endorphins, socialising and making you feel confident. Do to the level you enjoy and can cope with : ) No pressuring yourself !! Exercise is my life and I've get up through chemo as much as possible and would definitely say it's helped reduce my fatigue and keep more balanced moods :) For us all to go through this , I just think do things that make you happy and less stressed, there isn't substantial evidence or research on stress but it sure doesn't help ..Don't worry - be happy !!

Acupuncture (not on bad arms obviously) is great for pain relief and nausea I believe. I had some prior to diagnosis for joint pain and worked so well. Reiki is an energy based healing system and thereby scientists still can't quantify what it does, but it works by vibrations and realigning chakras - It works. I used it on my mum throughout her treatment and chemo, with no adverse affects to her or me as a practitioner :) Reflexology is amazing say no more, aromatherapy they have to becareful with certain oils with BC patients but as based at hosp they should all be aware. Shiatsu ooh lovely stretch me out too !! This therapist is accepting all therapies !! It's a common known fact we never get treatments !! So I'm grateful for everything I get back. I've got reflexology and spiritual healing today - that really increases my appetite and Alexander Technique Friday, great for posture and lengthening :) Enjoy !!! xxxx    ",

Be angry, write it down, scream it out , you've every right to feel angry let that emotion flow for actually it's a healthy reaction - but you know this as you've read about the grieving cycle that Dorothee suggested. Anger - the right to push others away and insult them as you feel so hurt and hostile yourself . You may want other people to dislike you, as you do yourself , but what I think both Kate and Dorothee were trying to say is that people clearly do have connections with you and care and that's why they try to help, whether you feel they are being patronising or smug. I think what you said to Kate was unfair. None of us can judge anyone else's experience and shouldn't even attempt to. This is a support network and not a vent to attack others - blog privately if you want to do that. Quite honestly Sascha the only person judging you is yourself ...you need to give yourself a break and make peace with yourself. This isn't going to change. You have a choice - keep hating yourself or start to make the best of a bad situation     ",

I was diagnosed in May too so we are 8 months in and I'm about to start rads too - I've not had Herceptin and will start Tamoxifen after Rads I just wanted to say that how you've described feeling sounds pretty normal to me - we've been 100 miles an hour receiving treatment and practically living at the hospital. It has changed the way we have been living life, some for the good, some for the bad, it;s changed our friendships, relationships, body image, how we feel about ourselves, how others relate to us ....everything. To top it off , we have lingering side effects that we hoped would disappear after treatment ended and the legacy of thinking every twinge or pain could be cancer connected and it could come back ! So just how do we live with this ...I am thinking , one day at a time. I appreciate some days will be more frustrating as I can't do as much as I used to. Some days will nerve racking when I convince myself headaches are symptoms of spread and some days I will feel plain awful and fed up with the weight gain, bloating and loss of all my seemingly feminine touches - but they will be back !! Guess being kind and patient with ourselves, understanding many women have been here and will pop up and say don't worry it will get easier.  I am so grateful that I am near to the end of treatment and that I do have things to look forward to and that I can start to plan again, I want to CARPE DIEM - seize the day as nothing in life can be taken for granted, and every day precious, I think of lovely Annie 40 and am determined to live on in her honour, she'd want us to. So I understand where you are at Kaw and think we just keep on keeping on...this ride has been bumpy and yet finishing it is the hardes part seemingly , when you can finally breathe and think what the f*** just happened there ? A year of treatment and changes that you could never of imagined ..positive is just making the best of a circumstance, remember that :) Hugs to you and everyone going through this xxxx",

Just cos I have had a mascetomy doesn't mean I can't admore a great pair of boobs and there is nothing wrong with silicone It wouldn't encourage women to check their breasts if they saw post mascectomy pics it's a different campaign and a different market, for the record I'm proud of my scar and would pose topless to show other women that it hasn't made me less attractive or desirable - and one day when I have reconstruction I'll be happy with silicone.

It's good to air and share :) Everyone on here is so helpful and supportive :) Gosh I can't remember her name sorry - but the post before yours sums it up brilliantly - the treatment, success rates and reduction of reoccurence is amazing now, so we have that too. On my fb account I posted this video of a cancer survivor and it was criticised by a mutual friend for his belief in his faith that had seen him through, my counter balancing argument was it is whatever people find helpful that sees you through bad times. I believe in writing and talking getting it out - hence my blogs and public face on facebook, but others would be mortified by that and think I'm attention seeking. Ha if I am then I always have been as my facebook has always been cluttered and full of activity. Some pray, some meditate, some shut themselves away - whatever floats your boat. Anyway my last point, she also mentioned in her disregard of religious beliefs (i still wasn't biting - my dad always said don't talk about religion or politics lol ) that this guy was lucky he was in a developed country and could be tested and receive treatment , I think at this point she realised I actually maybe going through something - as I replied , well thankfully for us we live in the UK. So again , count our blessings !! Just imagine not having the assessments we have had, or imagining that you had been diagnosed but there were no interventions or you had to fund them yourself ! I would be in trouble I'm feeling very fortunate again- so as much as I have my personal fears and lord knows they rise and fall like a rollercoaster (like you said) we still have a lot to be grateful for :) I count my blessings daily - not my worries :) xxx One more sleep till the big reveal, going to enjoy today as like Kitty Cat said in her post, suddenly you get tied back up in hospital appointments - is it me or does time move so slowly when you sit in the hospital - good book anyone ? : ) xx",

Good luck with your fertility treatment too - i'm keeping fingers & toes crossed for you :) Something comes to mind as I type this and I totally believe it , none of us chose this or expect it and it's sure a very different path to anything we had planned for 2012, but everything happens for a reason and we will learn from it, about oursellves and what we can and can't do, what's important and what isn't. Who really matters ....It will give us opportunities to change our future, accept our past and live in the now. That's working for me !! Prior to this I was a self confessed workaholic, giving to others and never really giving anything back to me. The past 8 weeks or so since diagnosis have changed that, so I'm grateful for it coming into my life to help me chnage - sure it's the extremist lesson that I could have done without - but hey, what doesn't break you makes you stronger & wiser.

      "Content": "Evening all How have you all been today ? I've loved the responses in this thread and can totally relate. Little My did say when I first signed up about people's responses and she was right. Of course she is !! You know this is the weirdest place to be waiting for treatment as you still want to actually believe it's not happening and some sick twist will mean you have to say to everyone actually I was wrong. Can you imagine the relief in that ? I have 2 more sleeps until D day - dread the day I'm renaming it. I have convinced myself that they are going to say a 3 or 4 ...the brain is a marvellous thing. But despite this lingering nagging thought I've had a positive day, relaxing, eating healthy foods, enjoying the sun on my body and reflecting. If today was our last - what would we change ? I wouldn't change a thing - ok maybe not have this diagnosis. So if we are blessed to now have a chance to improve our lives for whatever period after the treatments we should grab that and live life to the full, life is unpredictable - some people step out into the road and are killed. We have an opportunity to re evaluate our life, lifestyles and make changes and get to live for xx amount of years, there is no set limit , anything is possible. It's only not possible if we hold ourselves back, hang on to the past and refuse to let go ...life is always about moving forwards and that's what we are doing. We can't say we will never be old, many people have years and years ahead of them with no reoccurence, some people won't it's true. There is no prognosis for human determination and desire to live. But believe you can beat this, that you will learn from this and that you will look back on this period and think not only did I survive but I met new people, new things influenced me, I developed my abilities and strengths, I recognised what is and isn't important to me, who was there for me, what I placed importance on and what didn't really matter and mostly acceptance of a situation that is beyond your control. I'm telling myself this (blog away Al) - so my lovelies amongst the sh*t which is the unfairness of the disease there is a lot of positives to be taken. I watched my mum batlle Leukaemia and 3 times cheat the grim reaper when he called, sure he eventually came back- but when she was ready - a heck of a longer period later than the 4 weeks they initially estimated. From that strength and determination I find comfort - I'm playing to win too xxx              ",

      "Content": "Hi Anna, I am reliably told that we will have ups and downs and days like this and worse. Great !! I can't say I know what you are feeling as we are all different - but I emphasise and i'm a lil flat lined myself today too. My dog is nagging to be walked and i feel tired and drained. I'm going to force myself up. The reality of the situation is very much in my mind today, and the looming treatment. Treatment I need to win this but scares me too - there I said it. You know I wonder whether e think that when we have lower days we aren't fighting - but a wise friend told me yesterday, acceptance is key. That doesn't mean you are giving up or giving in - it just means go with the flow of what your body wants to do, express your emotions and don't think you will always feel so strong or postive. I'm a uber optimist by nature by i'm still having moments of this isn't fair, i'm scared, what if it's worse etc ...it's all normal. I had a drink with my friends Saturday night - distraction techniques and I could see them all huddled together with sorrow behind their smiles and whilst I wanted to scream come on let's be positive about this - at the same time they are right to be sad too, we all are, it doesn't make us victims or weaker or someone to pity ...it is sad , Cancer is a beast an environmental plague and who really wants to take a year out and fight that ?? So people saying I'm sorry genuinely is caring - it's just our own frustrations at being labelled with this cr*p Does that make sense ?? I dunno - I am very teary and reflectful myself today. I know I'll bounce back back up :) Always hear to listen hun xxx",

      "Content": "Like I could keep my big nose out of this thread lol  Ok, my thoughts are this, if you are used to using a gym and exercise regularly already and don't over do it then probably it's fine, but obviously when you are tired don't try it and when wbc are low it's not the best place. If you are new to exercise and not a gym member - save your money !! There are alternatives as Dorothee said. Sure gyms are full of sweating people so more likely to share their germs, especially as they are sweating out and leaving it (uncleaned) on equipment. Common gym problem !!  Vigorous exercise may not be possible - I don't know I'm not on chemo yet, but can guarantee I will try but it's not advisable.  20-30 minutes of exercise a day, even broken into 10 min bites can help with endoprhins , natural day light and outdoors just walking and varying the pace and incline will kick your endorphins and test your body. Pilates is gentle (sometimes) but also very beneficial :) You have to think some athletes carried on running throughout, but their bodies were used to it. I'm a martial artist, so want to carry on training -i've had nearly 3 weeks out since my mx and am going back to kicking (gently ) this week :) Listen to your body, there are other ways to relieve depression - laughter is the best !! Dancing around your house to silly music, sex , all are good alternatives ...anything that raises your heart enough for short bursts ...hope this helps  PS A a fitness professional - here's my disclaimer !! Always seek medical advise before starting a new exercise regime and check you are fit enough :) Speak to oncology - I will be : )",

      "Content": "It's a campaign for 18-30 year olds from Coppa Feel - do you really think that they would acknowledge and benefit from seeing masctectomy pics ? Shocking people isn't he only way to do things and general campaigns for breast cancer are always pink and fluffy as people tolerate and support them We have to agree to disagree - however it isn't fair for any of us to shout down a celebrity who was booked for a job and then be jealous of her youth, beauty or having both  boobs and stop hating on silicone - many people will have that as part of their reconstruction. That's my opinion and i'm afraid lots of people are displacing their own anger and upset on this thread against her - what has she done ? Pose for picture ? So what 4 months ago I would have - like I said actually people are using this as an opportunity to vent personal issues and not look at the bigger picture, It's to develop awareness in young women Losing a breast isn't easy but you have to find acceptance of the new you and let go of what you were. I loved the old me but love the new asymmetric me more - because I appreciate being alive . We are more than our breasts and hair ladies. So focus on the good and let go of hating other people's bodies, they aren't being smug, they are just fortunate and we were there too a few weeks or months or years ago - showing our breasts in bikinis or whatever - that wasn't being smug ...just living ...life goes on after losing one or two breasts. But it's a choice whether you sink or swim....i KNOW where I am Good luck to the ladies sill fighting their own battle or just beginning it xoxo  .",

      "Content": "Hey All, So here's the background, I was diagnosed on 3rd May and after my intial I'm gonna smash everything in sight temper wore off and i stopped looking green I thought let's make this a positive thing. So a photographer I know arranged a photoshoot of me as superwoman (no I am not Kanye West with an ego honestly) and all proceeds would go to Macmillan - so the Calling all Superheroes Just Giving Page was born, So in the discussions with the photographer and make up artist - we got excited by the idea of actually expanding this and approaching other women who would be at different stages of treatment to make a calendar and I figured that if I wanted to make a difference about what breast cancer looks like, there would be other women too. And ta daaaaa here you all are !! So obviously I am now one boobed and prepared to share my scars with pride as I can honestly say pre cancer I had never seen a mascetomy - isn't this what human beings are like ? we don't see things until it affects us or our loved ones. When I was preapring my friends and children for my change i saw the Scar Project and loved their work - it;s amazing collection of very artistic pics of women of very different stages of BC - CHECK IT OUT ! And I saw the fuss the Daily Sh*t wrote about FB banning mascetomy pics and I thought b*gger that - let's do this !! There isn't anything less beautiful about any of us, if anything we are more marvellous being stripped of our breasts and hair (i've got mine at mo, got a few weeks before chemo) I figured I would lose track of all your replies in the other thread so start a fresh one here to collect names and progress this ...- perhaps we should take it to facebook and develop a calendar group, you can see the images and meet the photographers and make up artists and we can start to consider how we achieve this - whilst we are scattered throughout the uk and at varying stages of treatment. What do you all think - oh I'm Alison by the way - Sassy is my Kanye West Alter ego :) xxx",

Chemo and it's unpredictable self. I'm good, but I'm only early days right - as everyone reminds me i will get worse - I love this challenge, quite why anyone thinks telling people it will get worse is helpful is beyond me LOL .Let me enjoy the good days without fear of the bad ones is my motto. I'm last FEC next Thursday, FEC hasn't been too bad really, no bed days, hate the nausea on ground zero and  just the constant stomach problems this second one, mostly I function and do things, I have maybe 2 days where chemo fog and tiredness is worse and not surprisingly they are days 5&6 after steriods end. But you know me and my determined self, I obey the chemo God on the first week and then it let's me take back over from day 10. Hmmm I hope Tax cooperates in the same way :) Enjoy the freedom of knowing no poison in 21days !! I can't wait to party once I'm done - I booked Usher tickets as my post chemo treat and my passport is itching !! lol  Hope you feel better and big congratulations xoxo",

Don't you just love the paranoia that being diagnosed with BC brings, it makes everyone's comment personal to you when it's not....it exaggerates meanings , we are all uber sensitive and prone to misreading what people say. I have recently blogged about a person on my FB Land who has been trolling me with a wacky remedy and not a sensible alternative like yours. It's not so much her weird and wonderful treatment - as each for their own, it's the constant canvassing she made of me and her criticism of my choice that wound me up. I never judge anyone , so don't expect anything from others. So Sascha my rant (in my personal blog) wasn't  about you.... Having this diagnosis often means we have very difficult personal choices to make that may seem odd to others, but sensible to ourselves..it's our choices...we have the right to choose so I'd never judge anyone and if I did feel that someone was taking an unusual risk I would politely comment not judge No more misunderstandings, we all have a bigger battle than misunderstanding xxxxx   ",

      "Content": "I'm feeling like a moany git and it's unlike me !! So 3 weeks ago today I had my MRI with contrast that I now realise gave me a severe allergic reaction, why oh why did I not go back over that weekend when I felt so rough ?? Never mind I can't do anything about that. It's 3 weeks on I'm still getting itching all over, it comes and goes throughout the day and the worst part concentrates in my hands that go bright red, tight and painful. I've def not been the same since with obvious fatugue What to do, what to do ...I called my breast nurse (who had been down to radiology before to complain but nothing done)she wasn't available - Thanks David Cameron . I called NHS direct who say see a GP, hmmmm, I spoke to Macmillan nurse who said see a GP - Can I get an appointment to see a GP - of course not. Part of me thinks go to A&E but I kinda don't like the idea of 4 hours wait whilst there are people that have more pressing illnesses- and plus it's not sooo severe now. Ironic that the BC isn't phasing me but the fact that I've had a reaction to the dye , that in the worse case can give you an incurable disaese called NSF - Google is soooooo not helping right now, I should never have looked up side effects and long term problems. And then I'm worried whatever is clinging to my body left over from this dye will affect my general anaesepthic or my chemo after - can they reassure me of that ??? Ok, this is a hypochondriac ramble - but at same time a moan ....grrrr this is what I hate about medical interventions, I needed to MRI to help conclude my diagnostics I know and I am grateful - but they didn't make me aware of side effects and they didn't check me out after they pulled me out of the machine and I couldn't move ...You think great, you made me feel ill when actually BC hasn't given me any physical symptoms ...no I NEED you to give me something to take away the side effects of something you've caused ....and here begins the story of wall building medicine...you have chemo to destroy the cells, but take anti sickness, steroids, anti inflammatory, anti depressants, laxatives , stuff for mouth ulcers, etc etc etc a huge tower of rattling medicines to support you after taking the one original thing...Kill it or cure it ....kill the cancer, cure the paitent but turn them into a human equivalent of a smartie tube in the meantime... Grrrr sorry am not ungrateful for medical intervention honestly and know sitting in a room for of monks, with lit candles won't fix this but all this itchiness added to paranoia it's something more long lasting has provoked this rant .... Just press delete and carry on with your day - lol - normal optimistic service will resume shortly xoxo",

Yup good ol gadolinium dye grrrrrr and def left me with low energy. In the late hours to torment my overstretched mind already I googled shhhhh don't tell anyone and that's where of course I found the worse case scenario that wonderful thought carried through till this morning My Gp squeezed me in (that's gotta be due to the BC label )and prescribed some antihistimines (not yet taken as needed to be before food and i was mighty peed off and devoured pizza) Probably just one of those days fuelled by itchiness grrr Hope you are well today xoxo",

      "Content": "Hi Winston, Long time !! It's a tricky one, Tax is definitely different from FEC. With Fec you lose maybe 7 days, Tax I think lingers on, maybe you get 3-4 good days in there. It's tiring, muscle weakness kind of stuff, my head is clear but after installation I get 2 bad days of feeling low and you all can tell how positive a person i am in nature. I was told by other members it's common to have the teariness, low mood stuff on Tax so don't be hard on yourself I was always told too that it would be tougher and it has been, I've carried on walking my dog and getting out but much slower some days and some days when exhausted do nothing. I get pains in my eye sockets, is his losing your lashes ? Neuropathy - was worse first 2 as left nails longer and kept knocking them. I had what felt like heart racing, panic attacks from day 15 on both 2 cycles, they didn't drop the dose for my last so expect them again, Onc again said this is normal, not out of the ordinary. Lack of taste buds, loss of appetite no much fun after the hunger FEC gave me too, but it passes - one time lasted 12 days before I could eat properly.  My relief was no sickness or nausea that FEC gave you. The aches and pains wear off and can be managed with meds. Fatigue is bit longer lasting bu hey it's winter, everyone feels like that who aren't on chemo so just rest up and let it do it's job.. Hugs to everyone, I'm sofa bound with blankies today with a Batman Box set xoxxo",

      "Content": "Hi There, Some of the best advice I can offer is take every day as it comes, talk about how you feel to someone you can trust and use online community's for support and advice, we have all been through something similiar, everyone is different, reacts differently and feels differently about things, but everyone will be there to help or advise when you need them. Deal with one treatment at a time and don't worry in advance about other treatments, deal with them as they come.  Never ever google if you are worried about something - ask someone here for advice or Macmillan, BCC or BCN but not Google as it can worry the poop out of you. Things seem scary now, it's the beginning and it will feel like the end of treatment is a long way off, but time really will fly - especially on chemo, the 21 days routine you will get used to. It's always scary the first one as you've nothing to base it on.  Sue was right about what she said about FEC, you have really cr*ppy days and then bounce back up and feel well just in time for your next dose and don't worry everyone thinks how will I get though 5 more chemos but you will. Def speak to Oncology about side effects as they can control nausea and sickness well by tweaking your meds.  I'm not going to talk about Tax until you switch to it but don't worry you will get through. Also there is a Younger Women Breast Cancer group on Facebook that maybe useful too. It's a secret group so you will need to like the page and then request membership, they range in age from their 20's so that maybe good too :)  I don't know your circumstances with family and friends - but talk to people, get friends and family to help you out, you don't need to do this alone and you will never be alone as someone will always appear. There are some brilliant blogs written by younger women too - Cancer Fabulous and Sophie Feels Better. Breast Cancer Care has a forum and workshops - lots of opportunities to meet others  It's a real sh*t that this disease affects anyone but there are resources out there to help you. If you need me message - I'll be around :)  Sassy xx",

It's like your body and mind have taken on board what you've been through over the past few months. Tax is taxing and definitely alters your mood. I had MX before so my circumstances are different but in a way I can relate as I won't be clear whether this has worked either until rads are over and until I approach the one year mark, where they hopefully will scan me. But I try not to think about this, keep focusing on all the positives - like getting through months of chemo and making plans to get back on with life !! I think it's normal to worry it won't work as that's all that we want so badly !! But that poisonous Yew tree is pretty deadly, so i'm very hopeful it's done what it should !! I keep my fingers crossed for you it has and that after your MX everything is clear for you !! xoxo",

I know exactly the fear of waiting for the bone results and CT results, they cancelled my appointment for a week and the 3 days leading up to my appointment as much as I distracted myself I was full of fear that it had spread everywhere and that I would be told they couldn't do anything - drama queen !! I was given my results Thursday, I've 3 lumps, my lymph node that it's spread to is the largest and 2 smaller lumps in my breast. They are going for a masectomy and anxilliary clearance first - which I think surprised me as thought it would be chemo first , and lots of lovely ladies diagnosed around the same time have been put on chemo first.

I'm so proud of us all on this journey and every chemo graduation I read makes me happy !! Can you believe where time has gone ? When we all met back in May !! It's been a challenging year. I hope you are feeling better from those Taxing side effects - Tax is Taxing !! Even this great big warhorse has been slowed down by the Tax machine :0 So yes, rads in January to keep me warm !! Started to feel ambiitous and hopefully about booking weekends away and getting my fitness back too. After living day to day for months it's nice to start thinking about forward planning again. Sure I know side effects may take their time to clear up and actually I wonder at times if the toughest time for us all is when treatment comes to an end and we start merging back to work, social lifes and daily living without the the medical interventions and with expectations of others that we will go back to the women we were before ! We aren't those women - we are upgrades - with new outlooks and the past few months will have changed us ..never look back, keep moving forward I'm back now - sorry I've been quieter, But the super boosted Sassy is back with irritating positivity to help anyone on their journey - stay strong to anyone just starting, you can do this, just take one day at a time and go with the flow. Much love to you Kitty, that brought tears to my bald eyeashes !! xxxxxxx... PS My hair is starting to grow on my head !! Fingers crossed for a chemo crop by Spring :)",

People can be a 'bit' self absorbed and it's not intentional as it's not happening to them so gentle reminders isn't a bad thing - I don't like asking for help, almost cringed asking to be dropped to clinic but if someone says no and it's a valid reason fair play, if they are too selfish , well you see who your real friends are.

Think about Sascha Rose, there are always options. Unless they directly say it's not treatable or non curable don't assume that's what they me. I don't like her use of language life outcome !! If she is meaning this is life limiting that needs to be properly explained. Drs can be vague and give you what you need to know basis - but I think ask her what she means by that, I know that's a scary thought. But listen, she said there are lots of treatments and you are responsing positively so that is amazing and there is always hope, you have a lot to dig in and fight for and I know you can and will. Dust yourself down and prepare for the battle girl. I've got your back, you can do this. Huge Hugs & strength xxxxxxx  ",

      "Content": "Hi Jenny,  You'll see from my profile pic I've embraced my lopsided look. It wasn't necessarily an easy thing, but I thought to myself I don't know that I will ever have a reconstruction so I need to feel at peace with myself. I'm relatively young and face however long I have left with this new body, I have to love it. Way I see it, is I love myself that's all that matters. I'm also single, so don't have a long term partner who will be accepting and love you as you are, I'm in the if I meet someone new they have to get their head around my new look and that trust me will be a challenge.  I did appreciate being symmetrical and waking up with two boobs and long hair, my new look is somewhat different. But I potter about without my prosthesis at home. When I wear it I look normal  and feel comfortable -its quite heavy too ha ha I weighed it !! I think it gets easier with time, take a bit of time to look at your scar, it won't be as bad as you think. I think mine looks like a cross , a kiss on my heart - ha !  I know some women are proud that it's a scar of victory of slaying cancer, I don't feel that way as I had cancer remaining after they whipped my boob off, but I don't see it as anything but what it is - it's a surgical scar , quite neat and tidy and a reminder of what we have been through. Over time the scar will get neater and fade I assume, I'm 9 months into treatment and had my op in June. Sleeping is fine now, I remember it being uncomfortable and not being able to lay on my affected side or front, but I can do anything now.  It has only affected my underwear really and I miss my sexy matching sets. I am used to the mascectomy bras now after moaning about that post surgery for a good while ! But they give a good shape to the prosthesis and I wear whatever I like. I wasn't a plunging top person before and aren't now, but last summer could easily wear strapless tops, boob tubes and shocked friends who thought I never would again. It's about dressing to suit your body shape and finding new confidence in yourself. BC can dent that....with losing boobs, hair and gaining weight. Regardless of it all learning to accept and embrace the new you is so important.  There is no time limit on this and some people never find it as it's something you have to do for yourself, but if you can , it will improve you life as you will feel happier and less self concious. Hope his helps a little xx  ",

You are such a wonderful person (even tho we've not met) and I can feel your fear and trust me girl I have my fears too. But that's healthy, fear means we are alive and keeps us alive and a desire to fight. Nothing in life should be taken for granted - in a sick way that's a positive about cancer it makes us acknowldge that - but at anytime we could be run over or road traffic accident.  So let's not dwell on what we don't know and concentrate on what we do, the treatment is working so far and there are lots of other interventions too she says, now if you doubt her get a second opinion, my poor surgeon is using the call a friend option and researching from other cases as i'm such a quirky dysfunctional case - are you surprised ? So they do have to seek advice too for the best optons. I know its scary,  we are young women with families but that is our trump card, that alone is my desire to fight and win, my kids have only me (my ex husband is a pig) so there is no way that i'm going anywhere for a long time- that's your fight too. If you want inspiration - check Jane Tomlinson - she carried on cheating her death and defying her life outcome!! For a huge extended period and her kids grew up. Prognosis is never accurate as there is no measure on human spirit, desire to win and sheer bloody mindness. So you my lovely have a lot of living to do - and a crazy half baked warrior friend beside you if you will put up with the positive rants  Hugs xoxoxo   Enter your message...",

      "Content": "Hello Cracker, I remember the place you are in oh so well, please try not to worry about it being worse than what is is, it's perfectly normal to, as the diagnosis comes out of the blue as a shock to all of us even superhero fighters like me. I was diagnosed about ooh 10 weeks ago now and had my mastectomy and axilliary clearance just over 2 weeks ago. What can I tell you to help, well go with the flow, restrict the amount of time you sit thinking and worrying about it - it doesn't cahnge anything. Ask any of us here any questions or share your worries, you are in good company. Resist the urge to google breast cancer, as until you have all the information you will worry yourself with worse case scenarios. Everyone will tell you that waiting for full diagnosis is the worst, all the tests and waiting for the results, your brain starts connecting every minor ache and pain up and makes them cancer related 9 out of 10 they aren't. Find things to help you unwind & relax , eat well, sleep well ...laugh as much as you can that's my prescription. It's a worrying time but don't feed the worry, starve the anxiety and just take every day as it comes. You probably think - that's easy to say - it isn't that hard to do too...we are all different and cope in different ways agreeably but if you allow yourself to sit and worry all day it won't make it any better...so keep doing what you were doing before ok...doesn't mean these thoughts won't spring up (a lot at first) but it means you have more control of them Hugggsssss Sassy Warrior Queen xoxo     Enter your message...",

I went from 0-60 in normal to F U Cancer , to why me, to nahhh it's not real, talk about multiple personalities. After a while you find a level and for me it's been about acceptance. Like sure I didn't want this double helping of doggy doo but I do have a choice to how I react and cope with it. I chose to see it as a good thing, a second chance, to make changes and to live in the moment. That's not for everyone but that's me - i'm the resident nutter. But I'm here when you need me, sometimes i take a while to reply as still busy creating mischief in other places ...Cancer is just another label it's not the end of the world :) Big hugs, be kind to yourself and just go with the flow there is no right and wrong to how you should or shouldn't feel xxxxxxxx...",

      "Content": "Hi Kelly, I think it's perfectly normal to think about it spreading and to look back on every ache and pain you have ever had and think it's connected. I think it's something we all do. I don't think there are many people that don't worry at some point and look for reassurance from scans, it is scary business after all.  After I was diagnosed and began to tell my friends , my friend reminded me I had told her the year before there was a lump in my armpit and I'd shrugged it off by saying I'm run down with a cold, it took a year later for me to go and seek help as I'd forgotten all about it. Likewise with my breast, in retrospect it had changed , it was bigger and had a dent, I just thought that was connected to my implant - and never, ever considered it could be cancer as I was fit , well and active and I was more worried I had ruptured my silicone - how ridiculous now !. So in a long winded reply sometimes I think sh*t I should have done something then and it wouldn't be so advanced, I could have maybe caught it at an earlier stage and stood more of a chance for more curative treatment ...but I didn't . Retrospective thoughts are common with cancer I'm sure of that, don't beat yourself up or worry, what has gone has gone and nothing can change that - it just adds to you worrying now.  None  of us know whether it will spread - we hope it won't, I was multi focal invasive ductal carcinoma which had travelled to my lymph with the largest of my lumps 3.7mm in my pit, that's the pits !! I had a MX and AX clearance and my pesky asbo cells had buried deeper into my pectoral muscles and escaped out of my lymph nodes and mine were.grade 3 too and for a while my surgeons talked about radical surgery which scared me to bits , so I understand your worries about further spread. However my oncologists are hopeful the chemo/rads combination will kick it to the kerb and that's what I hold on to hope. I've met women with similiar scale/grade and they are 4 years plus survivors so hold that thought and hope for the best.  My mum died of ALL, so I think when you have lost a loved one to cancer you think will that be my destiny, but that's not always the case. I'm not going to say be positive, but positive doesn't mean be happy - it means try and see the best of situation and that's what I do, I don't believe there is any harm in being realistic and thinking about mortality BUT ...I also don't believe that this should take over every moment of the day, limit the time you spend thinking about it, allow yourself to think and let out the emotions than switch on and focus on something else .. You've only just got your results too, so it takes a few days to take them in and let your feelings and thoughts balance out. Writing and sharing here is good as it's out in the open. I hope this doesn't sound patronising it really isn't meant to be, it's supposed to be I know how you feel and hope this reassures, Huge Hugs xxxx",
