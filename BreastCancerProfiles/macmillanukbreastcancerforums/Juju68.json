I'm 3 years post treatment also and the fatigue is awful , this last bout has lasted 8 days , I'm in bed already and it's really getting me down .  I'm taking tamoxifen so not sure if that's contributing to the fatigue , good to hear we're not alone . Big hugs xx",

      "Content": "I'm  new to the group , so hi everyone !  I'm 49 and haven't had a period since my first chemo cycle for breast cancer in Jan 2014, I had 8 rounds of chemo, then 15 of radio therapy and have been on Tamoxifen since July 2014. I'm so tired a lot of the time and struggle to wake up on a morning, I'm not sure if it's the menopause, Tamoxifen or both, is anyone else experiencing this as it's really getting me down and making me worry. Look forward to replies , thanks  ",
