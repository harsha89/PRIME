      "Content": "Hi, such a coincidence I saw this thread today, I finished T 5 weeks ago and my nails were fine but in last couple of weeks they've all gone yellow, brittle and 3 fell off this morning when I was cleaning the bath! Always knew cleaning was bad for you! Look totally gross! Still have tingling fingers and toes too and frustrating that it's impossible to do Coke ring pulls! ",

      "Content": "Hi everyone, I've just (2weeks ago) had last of 6 FEC-T chemo and my oncologist has started me on Tamoxifen already.  Due to start radiotherapy next week.  Have lost all (yes, all!!) body hair and I'm just worried that the Tamoxifen might interfere with my hair coming back seeing as the side effects could be 'thinning hair'.  Anyone got any experiences of this?",
