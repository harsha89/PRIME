      "Content": "Hi again My oncologist was up for exercise, and certainly at my hospital they encourage chemo ladies to do gentle exercise.  Me I'm a bit more manic, I did an hour spin on Saturday but not quite at my normal pace, I think you know yourself well enough.  I've had a few days off, but determined to get into the gym for a session tomorrow and Thursday.  Whilst my nurse said swimming is Ok, if you read what Tess says on this thread, chlorine can be a killer for the hair, especially for like you and me as we are trying to save it.  Sounds like you're getting enough exercise with all the work you are doing.  Start of day 5 today after chemo, feel OK, off  to work this afternoon for few hours in front of students.  That'll be a test!!!!  Hey and the sun is shining. xxxxx",

      "Content": "Update.  Started the day well yesterday, got through the afternoon, it was great to be back in front of my students.  Then....... a cheeky little (actually not so little) chemo kick.  Knocked me sideways, felt like the worst flu fever ever.  So got wrapped up in my rug watched a couple of hours rubbish TV then took a sleeping tablet (not the addictive kind) slept for 7 hours then this morning almost like brand new!!!  Got up and went to the gym for just under 2 hours, taking it easy with a bit of cardio and some seated weights.  Taught again this afternoon and still OK yippee. One thing, and I| don't know if anyone else has experienced this, but when you perspire profusely (better than sweat) you smell like chemicals it's almost the same as if you eat too much garlic it comes through your pores!!!!! Quite bizarre!  Anyhow still haven't washed hair, just stood under the shower and patted and air dried   Hope for another good day tomorrow which is Thursday - the new Friday. (And maybe a bit more exercise) xxxxxxxxxx Almost 7 days gone already since first FEC. xx",

      "Content": "Thanks so much for your great adviceTess.  Already booked in for hair cut, decided it must be the best way forward.  I too went back to the gym not too long after my op, the scar under my armpit got a little sore, but I persevered and now I'm back 4 to 5 times a week, not quite moving the same weights as before but gently building.  I too lost all the initial fluid and swelling around my lymphs with no complications.  I am quite strong willed so I hope like you I can muscle up the motivation, coz by golly it does your self esteem good.  I believe that you have to fight a little to gain a lot, so thanks for your inspiration.  Treatment 1 doesn't look so bad and I'm just off to find my flask.  I'll update once I get started. All the very breast.  xxx Toni aka slklady",

Finding it hard to think I might have to lose the one thing in life that keeps me sane, hair is one thing, but exercise mmmm any comments???",

      "Content": "Hi again lovely ladies Well I've done it!!!!  First FEC and Colp cap......Bit nerve racking to begin with but wasn't so bad.  Yes its definitely worth having the crop, just because it's easier to manage.  Let me tell you I have never seen anything so funny me with the cap, looked like I was togged up to to run in the first race at Ascot.  Yep. no denying a bit uncomfortable, but if you have your little extemities like the tips of your ears and your forehead by the hariline protected with gauze, it's bearable. Take paracetamol, I did not suffer any headache.  Taking the cap off after, well what can I say now I know how frozen chicken feels when it's defrosting.  A definite case of cap frozen to head, you can actually feel the ice crystals.  I certainly was a spectacle, I don't think it's a usual sight here.  Now it's just fingers crossed.  Nursie says I should know within a week. As for the FEC, I'm taking all the medication prescribed to keep the nausea at bay, and so far so good.  Didn't sleep much last night, and decided no gym today, changing beds and M&S (it's 2 for £10 again) will be enough for today but if I feel like I do today I'm off for a gentle spin tomorrow.  Nursie did offer special exercise classes for other Chemo patients, she decided they would not be active enough for me. Ha Ha, so I'm going to give my gym a go.  I'll keep you posted.  But guess what one FEC down 5 to go Yippee.  LOL xxxxxxx  ",

      "Content": "Hi again Just thought I'd update how the first chemo is going.  Today (Monday 30th) is now my fourth day after chemo.  I have to say I have had a little nausea but really nothing bad at all, I'm on my last anti-sickness tablet today.  I had a little glitch on Saturday but I put that down to getting really cold the night before at someone's barbie, I felt really shakey the whole day, but yesterday I was back to normal and was on my feet preparing and serving food at another friends barbie all day, with no side effects.  Maybe it was the bottle of red wine I managed to consume through the day.  Actually I normally love my wine but that is something that I'm really not fancying too much at all.  It;s Tea and Manuka honey.  I've been told that Tahitian Noni juice is also good for the immune system so I'm going to give that a try, don't know whether it''ll beat a good ol' gin 'n tonic but I don't fancy that either!!!!    Oh and I have left my hair alone, apart from a quick rinse under the shower, the only one since the cap, I've tried hard not to titivate, hard but hopefully effective. It's still there. I'm back to work tomorrow so we'll see how I go, so far so good, I'll keep you posted.  Love to fellow adventurers (well i'ts a wee adventure, you just don't know what to expect) xxxxxx",

      "Content": "Hi again everyone..  on the hair front my nurses advised me to use lots of conditioner on my hair whilst using the cap, so I duly conditioned up prior to the cold monster, I have to say it left me with a really funky look after......not!! but I did go to the gym several times, didn't wash my hair just stood under the shower, patted dry with a towel and then air dryed with a little bit of finger fluffing (can I say that??) I have avoided brushing or combing.  I haven't had a complete chop, it's short but not that short with a few layers. So far so good. As for wine, well when the old taste buds go, just not worth it... this weekend has been a bonus I could taste everything, so enjoyed doing my Keith Floyd impression, cooking with wine and sometimes putting it in the food!!!!  I normally don't drink on school nights (Mon to Thurs) Although the wine the night before Chemo was a definite MUST for me and will be this time I suspect.  My onc was OK with Alcohol.  I enjoyed my several very large glasses, I was on a happy high....(Onc did say that you feel it more..... cheap date Huh!)  Good luck first timers xxxxxx Just think ONE down...............",

      "Content": "Hi again lovely ladies. Thanks for the adviceand inspirational thoughts. Well I have been chopped in time for my first cold cap and FEC on Thursday(26th).  Amazingly my friends were gobsmacked with my new look it was that drastic but their immediate reaction was also one of  WOW' so felt pretty good.  Unfortunately, my partner who works and lives in Singapore, was non-commital, but he loved my long blonde hair.  However I gave him the task of finding some colourful scarves and bandanas from Arab Street, and suddenly he was in his element.  So, I am (or will be soon when they arrive) the proud owner of some really great looks for the summer.  Just in case.  Unfortunately, he won't be home for any of my treament, he was here for my op. So he feels a little helpless, but as I've said if all goes well, what can he do,  He's my motivation to get through this and join him in October.  Would have been there now if life hadn't taken a strange turn.  Hey ho!!  So today I've been checked over, X-rayed, etc as part of the pre-chemo process and raring to get on with it.  I must be bonkers but I have also booked myself in for a spin class on Saturday, feeling positive about how I will be feeling.  If I don't quite make it I'll go for a swim instead. I've decided that I'm not going to cancel my gym membership, there's nothing more motivational than thinking you're paying for it so use it.  I've also told work that I'll be back for the  afternoons after the Bank Holiday.  As I teach English as a foreign language I need lots of energy to do full days, so I want to establish how my cycles are going to run so I don't keep asking for other teachers to cover me.  I hate letting people down.  I' m being really positive thinking. So I am facing this little adventure with a little help fom my network of friends and this fab site,  I'll let you know how I get on.  Sent with love to you all.xxxxxx",
