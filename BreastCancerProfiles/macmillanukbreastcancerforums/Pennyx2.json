It is a terrible thing to happen, and all you can do is to take things in little steps, ask what she would like or needs to be done, and just be there to show her that you love her.

Unfortunately, the horse has bolted for most of us lot! It is though still sound advice for surviving or extending our life even if we have had cancer. After all, unless we make some changes for the better, the reason why we got it in the first place is still happening. This is though the sort of advice that I hope is shown in schools, as it is as teenagers we enter a time of decision-making that can affect our physical destiny. I feel really sad now when I see young people lighting a fag at the bus-stop, or binge-drinking then tucking into kebab and fries. My youngish neighbour smokes, and I keep saying to him, \"Look at me! Aren't I enough to stop you?\" He grimaces and says, \"I know, I know!\" xxx Penny",

They look on us all as just another appointment, and into the sausage machine we go. I was misdiagnosed (by a professor, a registrar and a consultant in turn, just flicking a glance at someone else's misreading of scans) and when they did realise (because the conultant mentioned \"starting treatment to your neck next\" and I said, \"Pardon?\"), I felt the first concern of the Cancer Mac nurse was whether or not I was going to sue th hospital. I felt very stressed and alone after diagnosis (was only told months later about CM nurses by a fellow patient in hospital) and when I mentioned counselling (I'd been raped and found the gyno examinations very distressing at first) I was told, \"Oh, you don't want to go down that road!\" (ie they didn't want to pay for it). Curiously I've stopped feeling angry, and can laugh about it - but I think that's part of the Acceptance stage of kicking my clogs. I'm very cynical now about anything the doctors say to me - and perhaps that's why I'm still alive when they gave me 3-4 months last May? I'm so sorry for you, Jane. I hope more of those Maggie Centres can be built where people like us can meet up. I hope you get some support from this website. I know I have. xxxxx Penny",

I never got on with biology at school as I lost interest in the Life Cycle of the Carrot, and sliced my finger open with the scalpel because I'd been chatting to my friend and had missed the all-important instruction from the teacher to SOAK the broad bean before we attempted to slice it in half! Now, I can happily google surgical websites and gaze at the pics absolutely fascinated! Oh, I don't do this all the time - don't want you to think I've turned into some weird ghoul - just that I too have learned to be amazed at the human body, its complexities and its resilience. Hair loss can also be triggered by other things, even by stress, and I have loads on my hair brush when I am going through difficult patches emotionally. Did you get the Gaviscon via a paid presciptin? I'm only asking because it can be bought over the counter, and considerably cheaper than the prescription price. I'm only asking because I know what tricks they get up to boost the NHS coffers! XXXX pENNY",

I didn't take anything except the Lansoprazole as it was when I was having radiotherapy without chemo. I did find that the Metoclopramide wasn't 100% effective in stopping my sickness, by the way. It may be that it has caused you to suffer from acid reflux/indigestion because I was told that Metoclopramide works by emptying the contents of the stoumach more quickly, so I presume the natural acid will be bombarding nothing a lot of the time.

Yes, I'm not surprised you are tired with all the coming and going with hospitals, getting your head round all the information and implications, and the emotional stress you've been through. It's hard to have a good night's sleep with this nightmare going on, and of course napping in the day means that you've had your quota of sleep by 4am. It was nice of the doctor to consider the degree of pain he'd cause you (be thankful for your extra bit of cushioning with that one). Although it is \"normal\" to feel angry and scared, I'll bet your situation still doesn't feel AT ALL normal to you. Be assured that you can pop on here, and there will always be someone hanging around who has been there/done that, so will understand how you are feeling.

      "Content": "Sorry they still haven't dealt with your haematoma - surely they would treat this as urgent??? - and also that you are distressed about putting on weight. I too was amazed that I did not lose any weight at all with my chemo - thought at least I'd go back to a lovely size 10! I'm afraid self-image is one of the big things we have to tackle, and for younger people it really must be so hard and feel so unfair. I know people (who haven't had to deal with cancer) say, \"But you look just like you always did!\" or \"But you look so well!\" (although I found out later that the people who told me that whilst I was on chemo were thinking the opposite but wanting to be kind!). I think our bodies possibly react to any trauma by trying to build up again - hence your extra few pounds. It must also be very hard to be as active immediately after your op as before. Hope that this resolves itself as you get more movement back. Also sincerely hope that the hospital sorts out your haematoma! Very best wishes xxxx Penny",

      "Content": "Yes, you've got things in proportion here. As distressing as it is to all of our vanities to pile on the pounds courtesy of steroids/early menopause, fatigue - it's far more worrying to LOSE a lot of weight and not be able to put it back on. As Kezzerbird points out, bones are sharp things when NOT covered by a nice cushion. Great to hear from you Carole but not that you are still struggling and suffering from nausea and lack of appetite. As you say, what I regretted most was the drop in my fitness levels and the enforced inactivity. Here's to you getting those, and a few pounds back - as an 8-stone weakling, I don't think you're going to be taken seriously with the bad boys on the door. xxx Penny",

It's really hard to take things calmly when you are told out of the blue: glad your husband was there to ring back. I do hope you don't have to go all the way to Guy's and be away from your family, but if they are the most competent to deal with it, better to go to Guy's for a few days than have it last a lot longer somewhere else? I'm just saying that trying to put a bit of a positive slant on a lousy situation! Well, the degree of the infection as you say explains why you have been feeling so down - and this isn't helping. Carol we are all hugging you right back! If you do have to go in, will Mr C let us know you are ok? xxx Penny",

      "Content": "Really touched by your life-story and how well you have coped up to now. I know it's really hard to re-adjust, suddenly, to the possibility of extra problems. I had similar readjustment hurled at me (although not BC, so you don't have to look at my profile!). All I want to say is that I wish you the very best luck possible for your scans and the results. Yes, as Jools says, we are all here and listening - you can come on here and have a good scream, and boy do you need to let it out somewhere. I know from personal experience about pulling punches for the family and friends, and being deemed the \"strong\" one, so everyone else expects you to carry to load and spare them. Humour is what saves us, I think. I keep a diary and all the terrible times I have had I turn into cartoons or amusing stories. It's one way of coping. Do you have a Cancer MacMillan nurse to talk to? I wasn't told about these until a fellow patient during in-treatment mentioned how good hers had been. Thinking of you, and keeping my fingers crossed for your scans. Lots of love xxxx Penny",

      "Content": "That was my hope for my own case, as well. So far I haven't sued either, although I feel that I've had to fight for my dignity and self-respect after the mistakes of the team as much as the cancer itself. It's the feeling that we, as individuals, are so unimportant that it doesn't matter - just one more brown file number-nobody and so what. I had a sincere apology from my registrar who was obviously genuinely distressed about it (the reason why I didn't sue the butt off the NHS), but my oncologist didn't even bother to prefix his announcement of \"We've made a mistake. It's not stage 2, it's stage 4\" with \"unfortunately\"! I have long suspected that their prognosis of \"3-4 months\" 14 months ago was in part wishful thinking! If sites like these were actually perused by the tutors of trainee doctors, so that they could communicate the philosophy that all patients should be treated with the precision and courtesy they would wish for their own families, we might be getting somewhere...xxx Penny",

Don't they realise what the original diagnosis entailed: not just the potential physical suffering, but the mental anguish you all went through. It's an absolute disgrace that your Mum was denied the chance of the Tamoxifen. At least you have one brave and honest oncologist now who has lifted the lid. I wish your Dad success, and let's hope they can have a lovely holiday somewhere they've always dreamed of with the compensation. This should not have happened in the 21st century, in the \"developed world\". xxx Penny",
