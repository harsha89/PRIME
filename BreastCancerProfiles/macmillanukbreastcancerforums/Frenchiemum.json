      "Content": "Hi Phaedra, you're so brave shaving it all off. Got my appointment for treatment plan on Friday. Not sure if I need chemo and herceptin yet. I know I am HEr2 positive, but don't know if they are going to offer the herceptin as my tumour is only stage 1 grade 2 ( as far as I know) I have long hair and think although it will take a bit of getting used to being bald, part of me will be happy as it's a sign all that cancer is getting destroyed. Just need to find bout what's happening on Friday. Lots of love. Xx",

      "Content": "Hi all.  I was told recently about Macmillan grants, and was wondering if anyone received one. I'm quite proud and was just getting finances on track( just).  In the past 3 years my husband left after a 2 week affair, 3 months later my mum died. Needless to say things were hard financially managing on one part time wage and tax credits. I had just started to see light at the end of the tunnel, got more hours at work and have met a wonderful man. We don't live together yet so just managing my own money. All was picking up then the cancer hits! I am now worried about paying out over the summer for high school uniform, which last year cost nearly £300. I had a holiday planned for which I can't afford the spending money for so will have to cancel. I also worry how I'm going to afford extra heating costs all winter when I'm sick and going through chemo. I would usually be at work all day. I know money is nothing compared to health, and I'm not usually a moaner. Think I'm on a downer today. I work hard, try and make life better for my family, and feel like the money worries are going to creep back up on me.. xx",

      "Content": "Thanks so much to everyone for your words of advice. I am going to pluck up the courage to ring on Monday. No doubt they will need to know every aspect of my income and outgoings. Good advice about banks. I didn't know they would refund money and would like to know more about that. Was awake  last night worrying how I'm going to give my 12 year old son any kind of summer holidays.  Thanks again ladies. Xx",
