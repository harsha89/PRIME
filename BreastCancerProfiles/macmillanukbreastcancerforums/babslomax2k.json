      "Content": "Hi rusty Welcome to an absolutely brilliant site it has so helped me,and it will help you get through this aswell i was diagnosed 3 weeks ago and was devastated felt fit and healthy before then suddenly felt ill even though i new i wasnt it was just the cancer playing tricks with my mind as i found that it is quite normal i too was diagnosed with a grade 2 ductal lump but have since been told theyve also found lobular cancer cells aswell which means it could have spread to the lobes so might need a mastectomy you will feel your on a roller coaster that cant be controlled which is quite normal but youll get through this just concentrate on what you do each day and enjoy little moments of that day, have goals, i allways say little steps, there will be hurdles to overcome but go through one and prepare yourself for the next listen to what your experts say and follow there lead, and you will get through, this is how im coping also keep talking and keep coming on this site it really helps take care big hugs   babs xxx",
