      "Content": "Hi penny I understand exactly how you feel. Nothing can prepare you for a cancer dx. I had a core biopsy which came back as positive for cancer. They can normally be pretty sure from the ultrasound whether there is a likelihood that your lump is malignant and my consultant basically told me straight out that he believed it was cancer. He would not have done so if he had any doubt. If it is cancer please take some comfort from one who knows that it is not a death sentence. I was first dx 14 years ago aged 31 and I am still here to tell the tale. I have been unfortunate as I have just had another primary dx this year, and although disappointing having been through this once already I am taking heart from the fact that I was cured of the last cancer as it has never recurred and this is an entirely new incidence. I hope all goes well for you - please let me know how you get on Love Kaz x",

      "Content": "Hi - I am new to this site having been diagnosed for a second time with bc. I first had bc 14 years ago and was treated with lumpectomy, wide excision, radiotherapy and Tamoxifen. I have just had surgery to the other breast for another primary tumour and had another lumpectomy, wide excision and sentinel node biopsy which turned out to be clear. I am awating further results on Monday to find out more about recommended treatment but my consultant advised that initial biopsy indicated grade 3 cancer and so chemotherapy would be advised. This terrifies me. I found radiotherapy no problem last time and wonder if it is really necessary to have chemo if there is no evidence of any spread this time also. It does also worry me the potential risks in having these treatments as my consultant always worried about sending me for too many mammograms because of the potential risk of causing cancer from too much radiation. I suppose it is the lesser of two evil scenario. I would be really interested in hearing from others who have been through chemo and those who rejected it love Karen x",

Like you I decided against the cold cap and have accepted that I will lose my hair - I have several hats and scarves and also a great wig so hoping it won't be too traumatic and i am looking forward to a great new head of hair when it grows back :) You must feel great to be over half way through - good luck for Friday and I will let you know how my first session goes.

      "Content": "Hi Karen It is strange how treatment can differ between health authorities isn't it. I have also been reading that triple negative cancers can benefit greatly from a regime combined with a taxane so I am going to ask my onc about it when I see him on Thursday. It is so difficult to know what you should be having for the best isn't it and I suppose we have to just have faith in the experts and go along with what they recommend. Just thought that as I am going to be enduring the rigours of chemo anyway I might at least as well try and make sure I get the regime that will benefit me the most. So pleased everything is okay for you so far and I will deffo let you know how I get on Thursday with my first FEC. Do you post any other sites ? Kaz x",

      "Content": "Hi KTB Your post has been very reassuring to me - I too feel that a few months feeling poorly is worth it if it means I get to live a longer healthier life. I am sure once I get started with the chemo I will not feel so frightened by it as I am sure my imagination of what it will be like is far worse than the real thing will be. Good luck with your final 3 FEC. I found the radiotherapy first time around not bad at all and I had 4 weeks then as opposed to the 3 weeks I will be having this time around. Admittedly, last time I had radiotherapy it was not straight after having endured chemo so maybe the tiredness will be worse having it after chemo when you are still probably recovering your strength - but I have to say having the radiotherapy does not worry me and I am sure you will be fine with it too.

      "Content": "Hi Linfel Your case sounds very similar to my own. I too was diagnosed 14 years ago and had just radiotherapy as lumpectomy was successful and nodes were clear. I wasn't offered chemo then though so did not have to make a decision. Now I have another primary in other breast - 1.2cm , grade 3, clear SNB and stage 1. Because it is a grade 3 and I am pre menopausal at age 46 I have been recommended to have chemo as a precaution. Am scared to have the chemo which is due to start on 19th March ( 6 x FEC ) but scared not to have it too. Have you any results yet on your new bc and what recommendations are they making this time ?

      "Content": "Hi karen I am glad you have not found the first chemo too bad. I am starting next week on the 19th ( 6 x FEC ). I Have found out today that I am triple negative which has hardened my resolve to have chemo as there are no other options available to me. I am fortunate that there is no sign of any spread to nodes and lump was small at 1.2cm but realise the chemo is a good precautionary measure so I am now happy to throw it into the mix as well as the radiotherapy. Do you know why you are getting EC instead of FEC ? Kaz x",

You are right - the waiting to get started is worse than anything else because you can't help but get anxious - I wish I had started weks back just to be able to get on with it. I am so glad you are finding it okay and bearable and I am sure I will be the same - just been to have my bloods taken at the doctors - Thursday and first chemo is looming fast. Kaz x",
