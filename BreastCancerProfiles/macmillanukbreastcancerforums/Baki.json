      "Content": "Hi friends, Ever since I was diagnosed with mets to the lungs and rib cage (so far), I have gone through the normal sequence of shock, absorbing the shock, acceptance, and then keeping a false pretense of baldness. I am especially scared of the fate of my younger son who is still completing his studies as well as the usual fear of the future unknown world that I am to move to soon. All my supportive friends and family are not comfortable speaking about death. I do not feel comfortable talking to shrinks. But I cannot avoid the feeling that I have given a death sentence and that my doctors are the solicitors who are trying to prolong the process through appeals. This feeling makes me want to give in and perhaps this is why my tumor markers and scans showed rapid progression. I am sure that if the new regimen also fails, I shall totally succumb. I have already given up on the holistic approach towards my new cancer since it has apparently failed to help the previous protocol. I've been fighting the first grade 2 BC episode 4 years ago, but now I fee that i have lost all my cavalry and fighters. What probably made things worse was the backstabbing at work which finally made me quit and move to a more serene less financially rewarding job.  Now, how is there any way that I can avoid this obsession with the death sentence attitude?   ",

This could be a reaction to the chemo till your body gets used to it. I've been constantly put on Neupogen at the end of each cycle. It is very important that you avoid crowds. Stay away from infected people and take extra care of hygiene. Also wear masks on each visit to the clinic. Good luck ",

This disease is not only killing my healthy cells, but it is devouring this trait in me as well. My close friend will help me with meditation and other spiritual therapies as this is her domain. She cries whenever we speak about death and I end up supporting her!   I just want to do all that I could for the sake of seeing my son established. Otherwise guilt will kill me. I am even trying to look for clinical trials if my current regiment fails as the least I could do is help researchers develop future drugs for patients. I hope the doctors prolong the process till I see my son kick start his career. I've invested so much in him and he's not coping with my illness. He panics whenever he sees me in pain. All my best wishes to you that no recurrence erupts.",

I need reassurance from my husband as to how he's going to take care of my boys whilst starting a life with someone new. He refuses such talk. My son is concerned and seems to be trying to help me sketch his future. He suggests that his dad tries to secure a small flat for him and his brother to share after my departure. My husband gav him a piece f his mind and refuses such talk. My best friend asks me not to \"talk like this\". I have a cousin who accepts this kind of talk but her words seem far too harsh and painful. I can't find someone who discusses these crucial matters in a balanced way. Part of my cure is to feel that my sons' future is secured.  ",

It feels so bad putting our loved ones through this and the guilt kills me even faster than the cancer cells and multiple tumors. It is this guilt that probably makes us push away people who probably love us. Please take special care of your daughter as her serenity is probably masking a volcano that you do not want to erupt at the wrong time.  I crave to see my grandchildren but my son has decided to name his future daughter after me. I hate my name but I love the gesture. It helps a lot finding people who fully understand how we feel. I hope that we do not suffer a lot and do not cause others much pain. My boys deserve a happier carefree life similar to people of their age.  I hope that our children cope and learn to snatch a few happy moments amid this ordeal. You too take good care and stay tuned xxx",

I also taste the infusions which may make sense and may not be an illusion after all.  My coping techniques change every time since what seems to work one time fails later on. Last time I downloaded a very interesting thriller movie that kept me absorbed for most of the session. Some times I use meditation but it does not work any more. Sometimes I ask a friend to come but this has started to fail. I have asked them for sedatives which make me sleep for half of the session but the nurses keep waking me up checking up on me. So I asked them to discontinue this.  I am not sure what to do next time. I just hate this disease from the bottom of my heart.  I am sharing this with you just to let you know that you need to come up with so many methods just in case one method lets you down. Alternatively you can use more than one technique during the same session. My very best to you and please do let us keep this thread going with more suggestions about coping techniques.

This is why it is available only on prescription. My advice is to go see your GP in case your surgeon is not available. If the wound is infected they will prefer to try antibiotic sprays for a day or two before prescribing oral antibiotics. This is what happened to me and the infection cleared up after a few days without the need to pump more toxins into my system.  Good luck",

One thing that you should know for the future is that you need to have the markers always done at the same lab because different labs use different kits, hence different labs can give you different readings for the same blood sample. On its own CA15-3 may not be enough but it is useful as one among many other indicators.  One last thing, please do not miss your routine checkups.  Best of luck ",

Calling me is a burden that I can sense. I cant pretend to be a hypocrite so I've started dodging their questions and replying by asking them how they do and how their families do.  I Share my true feelings with a few empathetic ones as there is a great difference between sympathy and empathy. I see how uncomfortable people are around me. I can't take it any more. I can't live with a sword hanging over my head (I have lung and bone mets) while people say I'm morbid and pessimistic. They expect me to ignore the sword and the SE of the chemo and to feel and act cheerfully.  Life is so unfair and people further complicate the unfairness. I just wish that they let us be. ",

Had your and my diagnosis been different, your scar tissue and my thyroid gland would have gone unchecked. But it is good that our teams are cautious.  I am counting the days with you till next Wednesday so that we soon have this behind us. We will also be with you during the long wait for the results. Please don't forget your pain killers.  I shall be hoping and praying that all goes well for you. Try to distract yourself. You said you love on Exeter right now, so try to enjoy the lovely scenes. I fell in love with this small idyllic city and its lovely scenes. I was so happy to go on two business trips there a couple of years back and was lucky to enjoy great weather. I wish I could be there with you to go on a long walk from High street through the woods and all the way to the uni.  For some reason I am very optimistic that this will be fine for you. Please go on long walks and inhale the fresh air whenever the weather allows you to.

Btw my onco is the chief onco at Gustave Roussy the prime cancer institute in France. Also my Getman cousin had the same PET CT scan performed as standard procedure for suspicious metastatic Breast cancer in Germany. MyAmerican friend says that this is also the standard procedure there. So insisit that you have the right to follow global standards. A stitch in time saves nine.

I'm fine with this and my heart goes out to all chronically ill patients. Let's hope that the oncologists manage to control our cancer. I'm glad that you opted for a clinical trial. Do you mind sharing more info about it with me? I am so much interested in signing up for a trial as if it fails for me, then at least I would have helped other patients. Pls do stay positive and take full advantage of the high spots in our roller coaster ride. Pls remember that we are always here for you so always share your entire rise with us.

You should also bandage it whenever you go out on foot even if you're feeling better. A few weeks of this religious ritual should help it heal for good.

Just to have things clear, you cannot expect to sue oncologists as the degree of response to chemo differs from one person to the other. Oncologists are there to help us and they have standard protocols that are approved nationally and internationally. These protocols have proved effective for the majority of patient, however it is well known that there are some unlucky people like us who do not respond first time. My advice is to find a way to improve your morale as it is 50% your psychological outlook that matters. Try not to be angry since these things are not within our control. You must find a way to vent your anger. My friends and family are a great source of help. Some meditation or hobby cab help you. Cheer up and hope fr the best",

Or is she the selfish type who wants to have fun and run away from responsibility and trouble? Surely there are some people who are that selfish. I'll share with you my brother in law's story. He passed away a few years ago after battling with drug abuse. His mom walked out on him and never lifted a finger to help him. She always expected him and my husband (also me) to look after her. Since his death she's been trying to go out all the time and has a ball every single day. When my husband was accompanying me to the therapy sessions for my breast cancer she shouted out at me that I was not the centre of the universe and that I am blowing things out of proportion. To add insult to injury, she kept reminding me of our troubled times during our marriage when he cheated on me repeatedly. She added that my husband now looks much younger and healthier than me and that I should be grateful that he's still with me. I never expected support from her, but I decided that I shall keep a very healthy distance. I think that people like your mom and this lady need help. One should stay as far away as possible from such people. They are the ones who need help, not you. Don't allow a psychologically troubled person to cause you pain. Exorcise her from your mind. If she doesn't come around then you're better off without her negative energy. ",

Guilt is eating me alive because I know that my disease is incurable. Money should buy us happiness but not a few more months or even a couple of years. I need to reach a compromise because I fully agree that my sons are going to hate the money if I don't use it especially that I am the one who had made it for them. I am in a mess and I can't think properly.  I have always been a very private person and I have never been able to open up the way I do with you. This forum has made things easier for me. I admit that I need your help as to how to reach compromises. My brain is blurred and I am doomed with insomnia. I honestly need my peace of mind which only a compromise solution would grant me.  Please help me out and brainstorm with me. Should I use the drug for  few months only and ask for another drug afterwards? Pls help me think and decide. ",

I was immediately put on a new three drug regimen including a new and very expensive drug that my insurance would not cover because it is not yet registered with the authorities. My brother gets it at a fraction of the price from Canada but it is still far too expensive. The sums of money that I spend out of what was intended to be my sons' inheritance makes me feel so guilty. Every time I swallow a pill I get this self loathing feeling that stifles me to the extent that I feel that the medication will not work. My brother has bought a couple of months' supply and it makes me even more guilty. How many people's lives would be alleviated if I donate this money to them? Why not just give in to a disease that will kill me sooner or later?  I hate myself. I hate my illness. I hate large pharma firms. I hate these weak governments. I hate this unfair world. ",

      "Content": "Thanks so much my lovely friends. Your posts have truly helped calm me down a bit. I hope that I shall be able to pull myself together in a day or two so that I am able to think straight. This disease has ripped me of my cognitive abilities, my job, my health, my athletic figure, my long hair and my dignity. I am no longer able to resume my full time job, but I am still able to make some money working on independent projects. These projects can cover only 20-30% of my current medical expenses.  I've been doing some research and have contacted some people on this new medication and found out that it causes severe neutropenia that may not be easily resolved by Neupogen shots. In this case it is usually discontinued. This explains why my brother gave me a gift for 2 months, after which I might simply be asked to discontinue it. So the decision is now to wait till February 13th to see how my WBCs are behaving. If I am to discontinue it then it is going to be a blessing in disguise.  My aims and priorities in this world have always been to give my two sons a good future and to help them do a job that they enjoy. I don't want them to be obliged to do something that they hate just to put food on the table. This is why I hate big pharma for stealing our hard work simply because they have a cure to our disease. I read a technical financial report that explained that there is no hope to reduce the price of this new medication until it reaps its producers a revenue of at least $6 billion over a couple of years. In case no competitor drug is manufactured the price would not be reduced. This is sooooo unethical, much worse than drug and arms dealing because it sucks blood out of terminally sick people.  I am honestly so much dependent on your support and I feel that the best of counselling would never help me the way you do.  I'll keep you posted as to how my side effects are. Love you all xxx",

The following link shows that pharma firms reap the average ROE of all sectors of 9.5%. pages.stern.nyu.edu/.../roe.html Not only is this inhumane, but I consider it unethical to do so.

He says that diet is useless if we have already got the disease. His recommendation is to have fun and enjoy everything that makes us feel happier. This is 90% of the ammunition needs for our battle. But he still recommends the following minor changes to our diet just in case some of the unfounded claims turn out to be true: - Prepare one litre of stil bottled water with lemon slices and fresh mint to be drunk throughout the day  - always add fresh mint to tea - most protein should be white meat - use organic yogurt and milk - add plenty of almonds and greens to your diet  - replace chocolate with very dark chocolate  - eat sugar and carbs in moderation  These are doable for me and I don't need to cheat as my PH is always neutral to alkaline",

I was in the same position 41/2 years ago and I opted for operation and radiotherapy followed by hormonal therapy. If there was a time machine I would use I and do chemo as my cancer recurred violently six months ago. I was ER and PR positive but my hormonal therapy stopped working for some reason. What I advise you to do is to carefully balance the pros and cons. The pros are increasing your chances of killing nasty cells that cannot be detected by the scans. The cons are the six months of having to shoulder the side effects of the chemo on your own. This is going to be especially taxing if your work and quality of life are affected.  My advice is to prepare two tables and write down the pros and cons for each choice and then weigh them as if you are preparing an income statement. Choose the option that makes you emerge profitable.  Best of luck with your choice. ",

My oncologists said that it was history and put me on Nolvadex. Then boom out of the blue my body developed lung and bone secondaries.  I am not here to scare you but I am simply asking you, rather pleading, that you forget about statistics. Please try to reduce stress by walking away from any loud conversation, troublesome relationship or even a stressful job. Please try to eat healthy by getting more fruit and veggie fibres and reducing dairy, alcohol,  and red meat. Exercise and meditate. Have fun and go on regular breaks and fun outings. Trust me this lifestyle beats all odds and all stats. Wish I had a time machine to go back to 2011 to lead such a life. Wish you all the health and happiness in life from the bottom of my heart.",

Always get rid of food remains instantly. I also use Signal sensitive. This way you can avoid most of the mouth ulcers. ",

I am to be partly blamed as I can't wait for more than 15 minutes after the session and remove it as I find the session psychologically agonising. I also have a small bladder and need to use the toilet during the session. Another reason is that I've not kept my hair covering the ape of my neck. It tangled a lot hence I lose much hair combing it. To keep most of your hair cut it as short as possible so that you can comb it using your own fingers. Use natural mild shampoo once or twice a week at most. Most importantly keep the cap a good 30-60 minutes before and after the actual session. Try not to interrupt the session by using the loo. Best of luck ",

      "Content": "Hi P.G. I think that your husband has been through a lot and wants life to go back to normal including the previous ups and down of any relationship. He also feels that he has paid his dues by being by your side throughout your therapy. People want something back in return. I have secondaries in my bones and lungs. During the first four months my husband was supportive but since last month he is back to normal. He complains that he wants to lead a normal life and that he cannot keep on treating me like a fragile creature. He does not understand that my new diagnosis has battered me, At this point I am trying to uncover whether he is simply unable to accept the fact that I have a chronic and terminal disease or whether he is fed up. Once I get the answer I shall act accordingly.  What I advise you to do is to sit down and try to make him speak out loud. Be his counsellor and be there for him as he has also been through a lot. Find out if he wants to see you lead a normal life with its rights and obligations or whether he is truly fed up. It is a combination of both but if the fed up part makes a small part then let it go. We were all fed up with our own newly horns but loved them dearly.  My very best wishes that this will soon be resolved one way or the other. ",

You have to convince yourself that this is not a battle, but a rough journey with the end destination safely defined. You are lucky to test positive for both hormones as it gives you an extra weapon to combat the disease. All will go well at the end and trust me that you will emerge as a totally different person. Also, hopefully your children will mature and the disease will contribute to their upbringing things that we were unable to. My son turned from a hopeless student to a bookworm, trying to please me. My darling just promise to look at the bright side since this illness does have a good side to it. Encourage your body to exorcise the disease and use all the support that you can get from your family and friends, as well as the Macmillan nurses and helpline.

The good news is that you will not be totally useless during chemo. The first 2-3 days are usually the worst so I notmally get everything on order (groceries, laundry, housework, etc.) a day or two before my weekly drip. Then I am useless for a couple of days after which things start getting better.  Later chemo sessions could get more difficult so I urge you to consider pushing the sessions to Fridays so that someone can join you during weekends if the need arises.

I am OK with my loved friends helping but not with sympathy from people who have never been neither nice nor close to me. Living alone could be a blessing for sensitive people like me.
