    "Content": "How I sympathise with your post - so much! I have only been on Letrozole and have the same debilitating pain that you describe and had the same response from the oncology surgeon at my first yearly checkup about pain control. Like you, I don't like taking pain killers and some days they make little or no difference. I have found some partial relief at night by taking Magnesium tablets before going to bed - but still wake up hourly to turn over! What is the answer? I'm trying to see if my area health authority will fund Femara - and not the three generic brands I have tried over time- just to see if I am one of the lucky ones for whom Femara doesn't have so many side effects as the generic brands. Other than that, it's pain killers and stretches. Feeling very old and frail is not what I had expected following the successful chemo, mastectomy and radiotherapy. Some days I feel far worse than when on the FecT - which is difficult to take.  I am utterly grateful for the treatment - and glad to have survived, that goes without saying, and I know that taking the Letrozole is the best preventive there is, so I am not actually complaining - but would like somehow, not to have these side effects so badly, for so much of the time. Any suggestions about supplements - I take a multi vitamin, Vit D, cold liver oil, turmeric, hemp oil and magnesium.....and I'm not honestly sure that any make a difference, except the magnesium which does help let me sleep at night - only waking hourly, and not having so many dreadful cramps as I was getting without them. Any suggestions would be welcome.....Gill ",
