    "Content": "Hi.  Not too sure what to say!  I will start by saying I have never posted on this site in the 11 months I have been actively sharing the thoughts, concerns, love, laughter, tears, happiness and sadness of others with their journeys.  However tonight I feel very strongly to share some words. I have always, been moved and inspired by Annabel, my thoughts over the past months have been with her as she has always been such a support for others in the light of her own concerns.  She wore her heart on her sleeve, whatever she felt, she shared it with others, what an amazing person to be able to do this.  I felt her fear, but never, never, never expected or even dreamt I would hear this news today.  My love and thoughts go to her family.  Her profile picture has always made me smile, it captured the image of a lady who truly loved her family, and how much they truly loved her.  Rest in peace Annabel, you never heard from me or knew me but you were and are in my heart.  Kim xxxxx",
