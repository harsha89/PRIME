      "Content": "I also have the injections to boost the white cell count, but they don't react with Tax.  I have been prescribed Tramadol for the pain but not had much yet (touch wood).  Food just does taste horrible and you just have to find they least bad things you can.  I find probelms drinking enough, but have discoved that freshly juiced apple and celery works well as does tomato juice.  Ordinary tea, which I adore, has become undrinkable, but I have found a rosehip infusion which I can drink.  The mouth is a problem but brush your teeth immediately after eating, then rinse with antiseptic mouthwash - several times per day.  They have also given me some yellow stuff to paint on my tongue to get rid of the fungal infections that attack the mouth while you are on this stuff - ask you doc for something.  I also have capsules for fungal infections.  But this isn't due to the Tax - more likely due to low white cell count, I think.  Hope this is helpful.  Best wishes.",

      "Content": "I have started to get a rash, too.  It is a bit like a heat rash - not itchy but slightly raised red lumps.  I find it helps to stay cool - cool showers, not wearing anything on head indors and just a silk scarf rather than wig or turban outside, and using \"lipikar baume\" by Laroche Posay instead of any other moisturiser.  It may not do anything for wrinkles, but I reckon that I can deal with those after chemo is over!! Also I had same problems with foul taste in mouth - found it a real effort to eat or drink anything, but have just rediscovered redbush tea.  I used to hate it when I was well - my stepdaughter had it when she was pregnant - but now I find that it is really refreshing during the very worst of the bad taste days.  Also try gazpacho - very fresh and cleansing. Best wishes to everyone.",
