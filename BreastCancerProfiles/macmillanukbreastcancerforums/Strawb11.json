The nurse phoned on Friday.  It was a shock.  I went for a walk that evening with my daughter and her boyfriend and explained to them then.  I explained the result and that I would be returning home in a few days to the best team and treatment available .  I spent next few days reassuring her and drove home and explained again to her sister.   Now I am 2 months on from finishing radio therapy.  I had chemo first ,it finnished in January, surgery (mastectomy, auxila node clearance and reconstruction) in February . I will be back to work in 6 weeks and am planning to return south for another lovely holiday.   The crew on this site are great any questions or just to share with.  It's hard, we have all been where you are now and feel for you.  One bit at a time you kick its ass.  Once the plan is worked out it seems to go faster.  It's do able .   Thoughts with you and your family.   Xxx",

From M & S online they fit as well and look as good as my wired bras used to be and they have cotton pockets for inserts/ prosesises .  I nearly cried I was so delighted with the lovely feminine fit . Got twin packs post surgery so comfy.  In the changing rooms one of the girls asked where I got my bras, she didn't know anything about my surgery ect...  !!!  So happy to find normal looking and lovely underwear.  I feel better in my clothes again.   Hope this helps.       Shirl",

I had booked to go to my daughters in Wales anyway.  So told the breast nurse to phone me with the result.  I drove 450 miles to daughters and she was working part of the time. As was her boyfriend.  I was in a busy market when the phone call came through.  When someone asks if you are alone, which I was, I just said spit it out.  The news knocked the wind from me all the same.  Then I had to work out how to tell my 2 daughters.  Well had tea and then I got her boyfriend on his own and said she might need some support for a while and explained to him.  I went for a walk with her and told her then.  We hugged cried and I reassured her I had a great team behind me and they would do A B and C so she knew what the plan would be.  We talk on Skype once or twice on Skype every week though out the treatment and she was up. Couple of times.  Older daughter I swore younger to secracy before I drove home and told her.  She just said so what's the plan? And I explained.  She supported me by going to chemo with me ect..  I would have been livid if they did not tell me and they were ill, so I had to respect them an tell them.  You wouldn't want them to fudge you.  It's very treatable and many ladies have gone through this.  Macmillan can help them with info too.   Hope all goes well.  Xxx",

      "Content": "Hi This reminds me of when I was diagnosed, my daughter said chemo was wrong and people had been cured by meditation!  It has it's place indeed, but no as a sole cure.  If I died, was I a failure for not meditating enough.  This reminded me of my mum, she had chronic depression and was in and out of hospital and had loads of different medication.  She went to a faith healer and prayed so hard for a cure.  It added to her depression with more guilt when there was no difference and was hospitalised again.  People stand on the sidelines and don't think of what they are saying.  So sad.

      "Content": "Hi mrt  Its hard to get the news you have BC .  I opted to get the result by phone as I was going 400 miles to visit my daughter, as I had planned for ages.  So I was in a busy market in Wales.  it let me break the news to my daughter in person and spend a bit of time with her before I returned home.  The planning meeting was the following week and then it all went quiet fast, chemo ,surgery and radio therapy.  I asked how long the cancer had been there ? I was told they couldn't tell but tests biopsy's told them it was in the breast and lymph nodes .  Now it has been cleared and there is no evidence of disease.  It is treatable and now you have things moving some lovely folk will get things done for you.  Phone your local breast nurse specialist and ask any questions you have or talk to us on this site we have all experience of BC .  Some like your selves are starting out on this journey or in the middle of it or come out the other end of it.   Thoughts with you both.  The waiting is hard try and find some nice distractions if you can, no point in saying don't worry but breast cancer is very treatable and you've done one of the hardest bits going to the doc and getting thingsmoving.   Hope this help a bit.  X",

      "Content": "Hi Denise  I saw this lasses fb thingy I thought it was quiet brave and yes folk can sometimes seem a bit patronising patting you on the head and say how well you are taking it or you look so well or you such an inspiration, such a fighter.   When you feel like shit and it cuts off meaningful  conversation.  Some folk can't cope too well with reality so we need to be gentle.  I see her point, I know it's scary and we all know it happens but many more DO recover from BC.  So take heart girls and give this lass some sympathy.  Celebrate what we have come though and enjoy.  Xxx",
