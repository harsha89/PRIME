I seem to be worse late at night as well and am just trying to keep as busy as possible to distract myself. My work have offered me a counselling service through their insurance company so I'm going to phone them as I think that might help.  xxxx",

Had a temporary expander reconstruction and my nurse did say he may pump it up for the first time on Monday, as if I wasn't stressing enough about going for my results!   Have you had or are you planning on having a reconstruction?
