      "Content": "Hi. I start on July 25th. Worried as have quite bad cording and think radio might get make that worse. ive been preparing myskin with water (loads) and coconut oil and organic lavender oil. The lavender has really helped my scars heal from two surgeries. Might go and order Aveeno now as seems very popular on here. Have Aloe Vera ready and waiting too. Will just chuck everything at it that feels good! by the way...I said no to the middle tattoo to my oncologist and when I went for ct scan and planning appointment they didn't give me the other two either. DELIGHTED with that! It's worth standing up for yourself if you can't bear the idea of tattoos. Now all I have to do is preserve those stickers/marks for the two weeks I have to wait and the three weeks of treatment... Generally very nervous indeed. Worried about skin but almost more about the shrinkage and shrivelling I've been promised will happen vet the next year or so. Any thoughts  N that? All the best everyone. Xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx ",
