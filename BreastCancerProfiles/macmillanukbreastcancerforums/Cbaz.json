I have a salon, so I'm raising my arms a lot with my job.. so I don't think I'll be going back into work for a few weeks . I'm really glad I found this group, and you can ask anyone anything , and get proper answers as they're the ones going through it all.. , Now you have that nasty little lump out, must be a big weight off your shoulders.. and you too keep us updated with your recovery ..
