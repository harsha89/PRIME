As my cancer gene is strongly  hormone receptive er8, pr8 i want to make sure im on the right one so ovary removal is an option and i know then il definately be post menopausal and on letrozole! Can anyone help who has had this procedure, tell me if you are glad you had it done and/or if you have any awful side effects! I already have hot flushes following chemotherapy and at the moment im taking tamoxifen with no side effects as yet? Deb x",

I thought the cold cap had failed too but no it doesn't mean that or id have no hair by now! Not sure what it does mean but I was the same, I tried not to itch it and the silk pillowcase helped me a lot as it was cooler at night for my head! I'm day 9 2nd EC and just washed my long hair and it's still here for now although feels a lot thinner but to everyone else they can't tell any difference which is good but im a bit worried as to how much more I can lose before it becomes noticeable but for now will carry on with it, hope that helps a bit Debxx",

I've just come across this by trying to find latest posts! I'm sorry your hair is still shedding and its' just another awful se to deal with! You are a strong lady and with the support of gorgeous Libby and hubby you will overcome this hurdle! A work colleague of mine told me that when she did 3 x EC and 3 x T 2 years ago she said that on the 2nd T hers started to grow back so fingers crossed it won't be too long! This bc has a lot to answer for and I'm feeling the se worse as time goes on both mentally and physically and I have battled too over the last few days with it getting me down!

      "Content": "Hi Joanne, I recall you telling me you had your lumpectomy before I was due to have my operation on 11th December which for me was left mastectomy and axillary node removal! Well I'm 11 days on after my operation and the first couple of days I was a bit sick from the anaesthetic but nothing too bad! The drains are a bit of an annoyance to carry everywhere but again nothing too bad! After the first couple of days I began doing the exercises warm up ones religiously! It' a bit sore as you would expect  but I wouldn't say i was in pain! You do feel a weird numbness in the area but I've now noticed that each day the feeling is coming back! The drains were taken out after 6 days for me and after they are removed its'  much easier to manage with showering etc and recovery. Well yesterday I went back to see the consultant who said 10 of my nodes were affected out of 30 which he removed! I was upset on hearing this news but his words were, it's  irrelevant as to the number affected as they did their job and caught the nasty stuff and you have had them all removed now! The nurse said my full range of movement in my arm is fantastic as quite often ladies are about 3 weeks ahead of me after surgery before they get to be able to get full range of movement back and now although still a little uncomfortable I am able to lie on that side and I've just been to finish the last of my Xmas shopping with no issues at all! So im sure you will be fine, they told me about blood transfusion etc as they do as a matter of routine but hey im ok and not required along with no signs of lymphodema or anything else! So from my perspective its' very do-able and not as bad as you think so enjoy Xmas and when you go your op on 27th I go to see the oncologist for the next hurdle of what treatment they are going to give me and a date when it starts! Big hugs we are in this together! Deb xxx",

You actually have eased a couple of my worries as I like you have felt numb from the operation where I've had a left mastectomy and lymph node removal and it' a horrible sensation isn't it! Also I've felt a little stronger each day but like you after a bit of potter g about the house I've felt a bit weak, light headed and nautious so from what the other lady' on here have said it must be the anaesthetic still in our system! Your'e not on your own I'm still in absolute shock and if theres' anything I've learnt from this forum it' to try and remain positive as there are lots of ladies who have been through what we are going through and have come out the other side having kicked this monster into touch, initially I panicked terribly and got myself in such a state but having calmed down and listened to all the positive outcomes from others on here I've now realised it' a rough ride ahead with treatment but it is very treatable and we can overcome this blip in our lives, I'm 48 by the way and go back to see my consultant tomorrow to see how the surgery went and a treatment plan!

      "Content": "Ah Joanne, I'm sorry to hear you have to have more surgery, its' a shame they didn't take all of your nodes when they took the others! I think as you say it is a rollercoaster and you accept what you'e told but then you get further news and it' knocks you back again! Blimey I think if she had taken my pulse today it would have rocketed through the roof, bit of a silly question but I don't think people realise the enormity of this until they are in the same situation! It is really hard, but I will say the operation wasnt' as bad with recovery time as I thought it would be, from having all the axillary nodes removed too I thought recovery would be harder but I am able to have full range of movement in my arm now to which my bc nurse today was surprised at so soon as she says a lot of ladies take longer to be able to lift and use their arm as I can so my only tip I can give you after youv'e had it done is to do the exercises they give you every day, they hurt a bit at first but if you can push through the soreness you will recover quicker! What date is your op Jo? Thanks too for a bit of positivity as when he said he initially thought as it was a relatively small tumour it was grade2 and stage2 so when he said due to 10 nodes out of 30 being involved it's categorised as stage 3 I dont' think I heard much else and went into panic mode, I did hear him say he had taken it all away but just thought it meant it would come back! Over these past weeks I've never been through so many emotions! I think we both will have a better Xmas next year but for now I'm going to try and stay positive for myself and my twins and like you say they will have taken it all away so we can be thankful for that! Keep me posted and thanks again jo, big hugs xxx",

I think I now need to get my fighting gloves on and fight through the next year of treatment and all that comes with it and then I can be where you are, getting on with life!, it is good to be reassured by others who have been in a similar position and kicked it's ass!

Iv'e still got 60% of my long hair although it has shed all over but not that anyone else would notice it is just thinner in a ponytail, no bald patches etc! For me it's keeping a degree of normality during this horrible journey but as others have said it is a purely personal thing! Again I think the most important thing if you are going with the cold cap is to get a good tight fit making sure there are no bubbles on the crown part! Afterwards a silk pillowcase helps to stop your hair from pulling and paraben free shampoo and conditioner! I have done the cap twice now and the last time I found it a lot easier having had a couple of paracetamol beforehand, I'm not sure how much shedding there will be next time so not sure of the success of it yet but for me so far it's definately been worth doing!

I think he must have thought I was mad as I told him I needed every drug thrown at it irrespective of the side effects and was inconsolable at first! He told me the lump was small but it pushed the stage to 3 as I had 10 nodes affected! Does this mean it's more likely to come back? I see the oncologist next Wednesday for the exact treatment but he said definately chemo, radiotherapy and hormone tablets as it' her2 negative but a bit more aggressive as it' s in more nodes than first thought! Has anyone else had a similar diagnosis? Just as I thought it would be ok I'm now in turmoil again! Deb",

I came to this decision due to the uncertainty of whether i was still pre menopausal or postmenopausal and wanted to make sure i was on the right medication which i went from tamoxifen to Letrozole post operation! The operation was straightforward 3 small incisions and was done by laparoscopy a small camera inserted etc! Post op it was a little sore for a few days but since then i havent noticed any difference as i was already having hot flushes and unable to sleep well prior to this op following chemo! Following the operation the hot sweats and insomnia is still the same but i would say the post menopausal pill letrozole does cause more achy muscles than tamoxifen but its not causing me major problems just achy limbs as though you have overdone it on the exercise! I hope this helps you a little to make a decision, if i can help you any further just ask Deb xx",

Once you've had the operation you will feel better as I do a little bit now! I've learnt to stop googling and scaring myself to death! Please keep in touch and let me know how you get on, we can get through this together im sure of it! Thanks for reassuring me too, it does help to know we are not alone, big hugs to you Deb xxx ",

I'm sure you'e right once I know that there is a plan in place to get rid of it I will feel more positive! It' just the fear of not knowing what I'm dealing with properly that my mind keeps going into overdrive and every pain or niggle I have since they told me on Friday  I'm driving myself silly thinking that it's spread everywhere else in my body and upsetting myself more! My husband is trying to keep me calm and positive but it is really hard! It really does help though to here that you have had a similar diagnosis and your scan and others have been clear! I'm so grateful to you and everyone else on here for being so kind, strong and supportive even though you are fighting your own battle! It's amazing how people pull together in times like this and support each other! I will post again once I know the outcome of my scan and what type of monster I have to share with you and hopefully be more clear and positive of what' ahead! Xxx",

I was initially told by the gp the lymph node in my armpit was nothing to worry about so hence 4 months later the lump has appeared in my breast! I now realise this lymph node was a warning signal but only realised now and hopefully in time! It' fab that you managed to kick cancer into touch and with support from people like yourself I will hopefully do the same, it' just waiting to hear what I'm dealing with as at the moment every bit of aches in my back or niggle in my body in now thinking the worst!

My hubby has gone to get me some nytol to help me get some much needed sleep, I think I'm not coping as well as perhaps others because I lost my mum to aggressive lung cancer and she passed away after 3 months of being diagnosed along with her twin brother who also died from oesophagus cancer 3 years later, so i know they are different but having gone through the journey with them ive just seen it as my turn and it's knocked me for 6 and I'm finding it hard not to think it's incurable like theirs! Thank you so much for sharing your journey Carolyn it' so kind of you and really does give me hope that I will see my children grow up, if it's ok I will update you and other truly kind inspirational people who have replied to me next week after my c.t scan etc xx",

The similar thing is that I didn' have a lump in the breast initially, I first found a lump in my armpit which was painful and having been told it was nothing to worry about by the gp I left it for a few months and then noticed a small lump in my breast which then turned out to be cancer and in turn they said there was lymph node involvement in my armpit! So in a way similar in that the lymph nodes were doing their job to catch the sneaky disease! I was diagnosed on 24th November and 11th December I had left mastectomy for the lump which was 23mm and removal of all lymph nodes 10 out of 30 were positive! I'm  now due to start chemotherapy on Tuesday next week which scares me the most as the surgery I found quite do -able! We are all in this together and I'm here if you need to talk along with all these other lovely ladies! Deb xx",

      "Content": "Hi, when I asked the surgeon told me that everyone has different amounts of lymph nodes from anything from 5 in some people to 42 in others! I had 10 affected and I had a total of 30! So in my case he removed all, did you ask how many you had in total as to how many he removed? My breast care nurse was well clued up on my operation too so maybe if your concerned I'd just give the breast care nurse a call but I'm sure if there was any chance of risk they would have removed all that were necessary, I'm a stress head though so I would be the same and id definately just to ease your mind ask them the question xx",

Im' just waiting to see if the cold cap has been successful on my hair! Keep us posted big hugs Deb x",

      "Content": "Hi, I can completely relate to how you are feeling, since I was diagnosed 24th November with a lump and lymph node involvement I was certain it had spread everywhere as I had horrendous back pain and neck pain! I then had a ct scan and mri scan which were all clear! Following the operation the back and neck pain subsides for a while then I've noticed when I've got upset and worried it comes back and nothing including doing epsom salt baths worked for me other than thinking positive, so as others have said its' more likely to be stress related! Ive tried to be more positive as i was making myself ill with worry thinking it had spread even though the scans were clear which just made my aches and pains worse! We can do this and I've found the ladies on here massively supportive! Deb xx",
