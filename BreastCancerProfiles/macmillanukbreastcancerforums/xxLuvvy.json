      "Content": "Hi all,  I\u2019ve been reading up - thanks for all the useful links, info, experiences and positive vibes etc.  I feel a bit of a fraud as I have the v low lv cancer - primary, breast conserving n I do not have to have chemo (ty Oncotype). However, although I\u2019m v fortunate it\u2019s still a tricky thing to cope with. After each apt I plan to return to work but then cry off -coz I\u2019m crying.  I\u2019m at the stage of awaiting the apt for the planning radiotherapy sessions and i\u2019m also beginning to think about the pos/neg effects of tamoxifen. I\u2019ve not quite got to grips with either.  Found this website today, after attending the 4 wk post-op follow-up group meeting at Mcmillian. Figured I\u2019d give it a go and glad I attended. I\u2019m finding the whole experience more upsetting than I would like and glad I\u2019ve taken my original breast care nurse\u2019s advice n not google but find McMillan or breatscare. I\u2019ll continue to read up and be inspired by you all. Xx ",
