      "Content": " Thanks Patsy and Susie, I 'm grateful for your replies. Will ask on Monday as I have to go back to Rads clinic as my pen marks have come off. Pulled a muscle in my back when on the CT table last week, when I was being moved around. I am on naproxen for the pain but it's not helping. Hoping it will be better before simulator on Thursday. What with the soreness from the arthritis,with holding my arm in the awkward position for so long, and the pulled muscle, I can't sleep or get comfortable. Feel like I'm a real moaning minnie, when I read what you guys are going through. Have a good weekend all of you. xx Flower",

      "Content": " Hi everyone,  I wondered if any of you could give me advice? I'm due to start Rads in a week or so. I've got the simulator run next Thursday. I'm wondering if I should have the flu injection before my Rads begin, I'm 67, or should I wait until Rads are finished? Thanks in advance, I know someone will reply, you're all such a great help.

      "Content": "Thanks for all your replies. Can't help wondering if five years on Anastrozole is as good as ten years on Tamoxifen. Does this mean that after five years on Anastrozole you have no more protection from recurring cancer, whereas with Tamoxofen, at least you have ten years protection? Side effects of Tamoxifen include chance of uterine cancer and blood clots. What a mine field!!! Best of luck to all of us. We are in the hands of the oncologists. Breast surgery was not too bad, healing seems to be good but very bruised boob! Hope your side effects reduce Kathleen, sounds awful for you. I'll be glad to have the rads over and done with. Thanks again for responses. Flower",

      "Content": "Thanks for your replies and your welcome. I would just be taking anastrazole. The trial drug was unknown, the trial is now closed but it looked like my tumour decreased from 20ml to 18ml. I realise two weeks isnt enough really for side effects to show but as you say, better the devil I know. Rads start in two to four weeks, just had assessment meeting, waiting now for ct scan and simulator before rads. Althougj Im lucky to have been given the all clear on snb and clear margins, I cant help thinking that what if it comes back. Im a realist, positive thinking and all that, but Im not jumping for joy yet as it seems a long road ahead, amarathon, not a sprint. Oncologist recommended Tamoxifen but the side effects worry me. Thanks agaon, Flower.  ",

      "Content": "Hi all Ive asked to be put on anastrozole for five years instead of tamoxifen for ten years. Im 67 and have had w/l/e and s/n/b which was clear, for early invasive breast cancer. Start rads shortly. I had been on a drug trial for anastrazole (along with a new drug, )(unknown) so thought that I would stay on that, as it didnt seem to have bad side effects, even though it was only for a fortnight before surgery. I worry more about the side effects of tamoxifen but realise the risk of bone thinning and aching joints etc with anastrazole. Any comments please? Thanks, Flower.",

      "Content": "Thankyou Heather, Grogg and Crystaljuju for your advice. I spoke to one of the staff today who was very nice and helpful. She said that my boob was quite red and bruised before Rads ( as there was difficulty in placing the wire for the WLE which had to be done twice, as the first time was unsuccessful.)  She said that they will watch the skin on my boob very carefully each day, so not to worry too much. If needed, they will give me something to use. In the meantime, continue with the Aqueous ( spelling) cream and Simple soap. I felt a lot better aftet talking to her as she was right, the boob was pretty awful before Rads what with bruising and redness. She also said that as we get older, meaning me, at 68, not her, at probably no more than 30, our bodies take longer to heal after a trauma like cancer. Thanks again ladies, I feel better having let my worries out. You all take care. Flowerburn xx  ",
