      "Content": "dont know if this is any help i got boob off in dec all was ffinr but was going back and forward to hospitail to get drained as developed a seroma,where they had been draining a seroma i developed a massive hole 4cm long 6cm deep looked like id been shot with a snooker ball,they put on pico wound dressings which run on a battery for a week and this was helping to seal the wound anyway developed strep a infection and they took dressings off and wound was packed with ribbon three weeks later they decided to try and stitch wound as was delaying start of chemo they stitched wound on the monday and i got cellultis on the tuesday all i can say is the pico wound dressing was good but was new to our hospitail might be worth asking they have decided that i will get packed with ribbon every day until wound heals which could be another three weeks all the best to you hope they find somthing that suits your needs",
