      "Content": "Hi Paula  thanku for ur reply I'm going to see breast nurse Thursday hopefully. I also had a lumpectomy and had 6/25 nodes removed of which 6 were infected. My consultant said that it was only small 1mm.  it's a mind game all this worry.  I'm dealing wiv lymphoma, worrying about the op as both consultants don't know wat to do as I'm not a small chested lady!! Then all these different pains \"is it cancer or isn't it\" driving myself round the bend. Everyone tells me I'm a strong lady but dealing wiv this is just beyond belief and I know I shouldn't be moaning I should b thankful. ",
