Rather late in the day I read that some people become lactose intolerant when on it and when I cut out nearly all dairy and switched to lactose free milk my problems stopped immediately, so that could be worth your while to try. Good luck.",

I'm retired now but I would've been capable of returning to a non manual job well within a fortnight, once I'd stopped having the nurse in to change the dressings. On the other hand, if I'd have had paid sick leave I'd probably have taken a month off. When I had the mastectomy 30 years ago, I took 4/5 months off - there had to be some benefit from having cancer!",

It still looked good all these years later and the prosthesis only needed changing this year after it was discovered that it had ruptured.",

It still isn't back to what it was before and I'm having an xray this week to see whether any actual damage has been done. What it has made me realise is that, if this were to happen again I would not only have little quality of life but pretty well no life at all, because of my specific situation. Obviously this had made me very wary of taking an AI which I should be starting after Christmas but I'm prepared to give it a go if any problems like this are likely to be temporary and return to normal after stopping. The same goes for many other commoin side effects, all of which seem to aggravate or increase existing problems! So really, I'm wondering whether any people who've had joint pain have continued to have it after stopping or switching, in which case I'll refuse and go down the natural route.",
