      "Content": "Hello everyone,  Thank you for sharing your experiences, I've been reading through them and it has helped me prepare for my upcoming rads. I had a double mastectomy 11 weeks ago and was extremely lucky in that I didn't have to have chemo. I'm starting radiotherapy (on the right breast cancer side) next Thursday for 15 sessions. I'm a little nervous but have been very reassured by people's experiences and I'm keen to get it over and done with so I can focus on getting back to 'normal'.  Quick question - it's my wedding anniversary on the 2nd June. I will have had 6 sessions by then. Am I right in thinking that is generally has a cumulative effect, so I should be ok for a night out? Nothing too wild, we were thinking theatre and meal.  Thank you x Oh - and....what an earth am I going to buy my husband for our wood anniversary?! ;) ",

      "Content": "Thank you for your responses - theatre has now been booked and a babysitter arranged. Even if the unlikely happens and I fall asleep on my husband's shoulder, it will be good to be doing something fun rather than having yet another hospital appointment! Rosie1947 - what list did you get from the clinic? I was told there was nothing recommended or banned, apparently even the aluminium in deodorants has now been found to be ok. I did request and got given a prescription for R1 & R2 gels after reading a lot of good reports for them on here. It may be unproven but it can't hurt to try it. 3.5 days to go!! ",
