      "Content": "Hello Cazza I'm so sorry for what's happened to you and at a time when you are perhaps at your most vulnerable and needing the support of the person you thought was closest to you.I dont think anyone can tell you what to do only you can decide if what you have or had is worth saving.To blame your illness is I think like blaming you and what has happened is not your fault and don't ever think that it is.When life is at its hardest it can either bring people closer together or can push them further apart.You say your cancer was one of the reasons he gave for seeking someone else so it sounds as if there where other reasons too.Whatever his excuses again only you know if your relationship is worth saving and if it can survive what he has done.My ex was having an affair whilst I was in hospital having my operation my daughters found him out as he was out every night whilst I was in hospital.My marriage did not survive we had been married for 42 years and known each other for 49 years.I hope you can work things out in a way that gives you some peace of mind but do not make a knee jerk decision especially when you are as you have said in deep shock.I wish you well whatever you decide Cruton x",
