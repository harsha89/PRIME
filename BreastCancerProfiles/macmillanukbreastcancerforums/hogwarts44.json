      "Content": "Hi thanks so much for your advice, I had a good chat with my wonderful hubby last night and feel much better but decided to see my GP next week if i don't feel brighter by then. I had counselling after my radiotherapy as I had a mini meltdown as you say once treatments were over my brain suddenly kicked in and said \"WHAT ON EARTH JUST HAPPENED\" it helped at the time. I find that when i'm tired I get more emotional and I find it hard to admit when I need a rest.  I hate needing special treatment at work but I just can't keep up with shift work and I think others may think well it was two years ago I should be over it by now but it takes so much longer than I expected and that's frustrating for a get up and go girl. I hate having a whinge when so many others are suffering more than me and you are all so brave. love to you all and many thanks xxx",

      "Content": "HI all i'm new to this blogging so bare with me. I was diagnosed with breast ca 2 yrs ago had lumpectomy and radiotherapy,I'm 39 and pre menopausal so had 6 months of zoladex and 1yr of tamoxifen before the side effects became unbearable. I have been left with chronic fatigue, muscle and ligament weakness which led to constant pain and discomfort. I have two children and a busy working life which is stressful. I also lost my brother suddenly 6 months ago and everytime I feel slightly positive about the future I feel like I take one step forward and 3 steps back. I am finding it increasingly difficult to stay positive and cry most days. Is this normal 2 years in? will it get any better?",
