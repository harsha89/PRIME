      "Content": "Firstly happy New Year to all . Lets hope for continuing health and happiness in amongst all of this craziness . I have now finished Chemo waiting for rads and the 5 year endocrine therapy. ........ I thought I would share Christmas presents the least thought out and a more thought out one , just as a bit of light relief . Having just finished chemo and sitting with a lovely sheen on my head , my least thought out one was a lovely shampoo and conditioner set , which might have been ok if the person had said this is for when your hair comes back , but no ......the look on her face when I opened it and she realised what she had done I just howled with laughter . She did eventually , she must still visualise me with hair !!! My more thought out one was 4 bags of coal put into the outhouse when I was out and a card through the door which simply said warm your toes with this , I had been saying to this friend that I was feeling the cold more recently and how expensive coal was but how much I liked my real fire . Obviously I was very grateful for both gifts but it did make me smile ........ Onward and upwards Ladies and Gents .",

Tea coffee and milky things were non no's but warm juice and herbal teas ok ,loads of water extra pillows as bit of gastric burn when flat . Was like being pregnant no strong smells certainly not your favourite perfume ........ You'll never wear it again . Plain crackers or tuc to keep something on your tummy every hour or so helped me with the nausea . Sucking crystallised ginger too . Still couldn't face an egg , but not sleeping as much in the last two days . Good wishes .",

      "Content": "Hi there lost my right boob too after wide local excision margin too close for comfort . I was just pleased to get rid of anything that might have been left . I always had huge boobs and had reduction on left when I had the first surgery plus node clearance . I was lucky my surgeon was happy to put a silicone implant in so I have what I think of as a half breast and a whole one but you can't really tell when I am dressed . I don't have a significant other to worry about and I probably wouldn't anyway . I am pleased with the result I have no nipple but have joked with mates I can always use a jelly tot ........ Handy for any diabetic emergencies !!! I was all for recon using Dieppe flap later , but now i am not even sure I want to bother , having said that I am still going thro chemo etc , may become more important later . So to summarise I am ok with it hope you will be too . Let me know how you get on .Fiona",

      "Content": "Hi it is usually base line observations. Bp pulse heart rate . May doEEG if you have not had a recent one , routine bloods , they may cross match you in case you need a top up . MRSA swabs urine testing height weight etc for anaesthetic . Go thro previous medical history , check how you will manage at home post . Ie who can help you . They may measure you for post op bra . Your opportunity to ask questions re anything bothering you . Usually access to an anaesthetist. Probably wont be the one doing your surgery but available if any concerns re anaesthetic . It's a bit like a winter service making sure they have all your information prior to setting off on the next bit of your journey so you get to your destination without any surprises or slippy roads . May I wish you all the best for your surgery and for the season .",

Gone a bit dizzy blonde , had a supper for friends last night and wig try on have got blonde red and brown so maybe a throw back from that ! Have decided to use them like hats in the winter ,also got a faux fur trapper hat which covers my eyebrows and is sooo cozy . Do have the desire to be a bit naughty and whip the wigs / hats on and off when out and about and as a friend said skin it !!!! I admire how people are in the main so positive and glass half full it certainly inspires me to remain in the onward and upwards mode and as has been said keep ticking the various stages off ...........",

Is the fluid smelly at all , is there any redness or inflammation , is the area warmer than usual also what colour is the fluid . ? Think it's important to have it checked . Everybody heals at at a different rate and it could be serous fluid from lymph , but the wound itself is worth a look to make sure it is healing as expected . I had WLE 4 weeks before went for MX and did get some fat necrosis which was sticky and almost greasy looking fluid from the wound but there has been nothing with the last surgery . I am hopeless always need to know the far end of a fart , and ask the BCN a lot of questions , but they always say they would rather be contacted about anything than have me worrying. Would love to know how you get on .",
