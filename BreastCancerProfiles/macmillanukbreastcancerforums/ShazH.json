      "Content": "Thank you ladies! I didn\u2019t think it seemed right. I have the added complication that I\u2019m being treated in Spain! So I don\u2019t have a BCN like in tbe UK (she just appeared for a few weeks after my op to change dressings, then that was it!). I have a translator who comes to all appointments with me, so I\u2019ll get her on the case in the morning. I had my initial appointment with the Radiologist in Nov & have had the scan & tattoo, plus I\u2019ve met with the radiotherapy nurse in Dec. But then it all ground to a halt! Thanks for taking the time to reply.  Shaz xx",

      "Content": "Hi ladies I have Inflammatory Breast Cancer stage 3c, I initislly had 6 months of chemo followed by a mastectomy on 11 Oct with full lymph node removal. Pathology showed that, despite the 6 months chemo, they removed a 3cm tumour & 23 malignant lymph nodes. I have been waiting for radiotherapy  to start ever since. I have already started on 3 weekly Herceptin injections plus daily Letrozole tablets.  My question is - how long did you all wait after mastectomy for radiothetapy to begin? It\u2019s now just over 3 months since I had my op & I think this is too long to wait, especially when I have an aggressive cancer! Thank you! Shaz",
