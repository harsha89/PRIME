      "Content": "Maggie Dot just 8 people extra survive after ten years out of 100 if they have the treatment Hi Maggie Dot, I'm not in the category of people you are looking to for advice and guidance. However I am just about to have my third FEC chemo on Friday, followed by T for 3 cycles, then surgery and radiotherapy. Here's my reaction to your post. In my view, 8 extra people surviving  for 10 years (or beyond?) because of chemo and radiotherapy is 8% and not to be sneezed at, particularly if you are one of that 8%. Also, your consultant , who is the expert and very experienced in different treatments and their outcomes, is recommending that you have these treatments. Cancer treatments have come on in leaps and bounds even from 10 years ago let alone 40 years ago when you saw your poor mum really suffer through her own treatments to no avail. My own experience of chemo so far has been fine. I've found It rather like flu but with no definite symptoms apart from fatigue for the first 10 days of the cycle, thirst and blunted tastebuds. I'm now towards the end of week 3 and feel normal. I had no hesitation in following the treatment plan mapped out for me as I want the best possible outcome. Hope this helps you with your decision making. It's my own personal take on what you have written and on my own situation. All the best with reaching a decision you are comfortable with, Hannah x",

      "Content": "This year was meant to be 'The Year of the Holiday' as I was approaching the second anniversary of being free of bowel cancer. So, early this year, I booked a couple of lovely holidays with my husband and one with my sister. Then came my breast cancer diagnosis. I've spent the last few days unwinding the lovely holiday bookings and completing insurance claim forms, ahead of chemo starting on 10th June. I've done forms for me, my husband and my sister as it was me who booked the bally holidays in the first place. I could spit! or cry! or shout! I'm also unable to use a lovely spa day and massage gift my sons gave me and my husband for my 60th birthday in March. It has only a 6 month validity and I'm hoping that the local health club will let me postpone it until treatment is well and truly over. Again, cue spitting, crying and shouting! Anyway, that's me vented. I appreciate some people couldn't have booked lovely holidays, well or ill, but this is not how I expected to spend my early retirement with my normally-retired husband. It feels like I'm being dismantled bit by bit and my life feels so out of my control. Can't wait to start treatment now.....  Hannah xx ",

I am feeling a bit more philosophical about it all, today. How is your treatment going? I hope that your work is understanding and supportive. As I said to my husband the other day, I'm lucky I don't have to cope with work and cancer. He said, 'But it's not a good way to spend your retirement.....'. Indeed! I've found Saga's travel insurers to be lovely to deal with on the claims front. A young chap spent an hour on the phone with me and started to complete the claim forms for me. Where I'd just paid a deposit on a couple of holidays, he said the money would be in my account in 7 days. Two other companies, one a very well-known insurer of medical conditions, not very good. Anyway, roll on my treatment. Hannah xx",

The spa people say I can postpone my day indefinitely, but then proceeded to say they would not do a massage on anyone until they were 5 years clear of cancer. I wonder if you or anyone else on the forum has heard of that? At one point she said I could just come for the swim and the lunch part and I pointed out that that was not what my boys had spent a fair bit of their hard earned money on. We'll see....... As I've not started treatment yet, I'm not sure what surgery I'll be offered, but the route you're taking sounds good to me. Good luck and best wishes for 20th June and happy diving! Hannah xx",

      "Content": ". Really didn't think I'd get so fretful over hair despite what the onco said. Have been to my hospital wig supplier and also another place. I was quite shocked at the limited range and inappropriate samples they carry. It is hard to visualise what the short style wig you'd like to see on you in a light brown could be like when it's only available in white! Well I just saw my mother when I looked in the mirror! I sort of expected some style advice too but was given 4 catalogues to flick through for other wigs to be ordered in to try. Wigs plonked on head, then 'What do you think?' I'd be interested to hear if any of you have gone down the wig route yet and how you got on. Our hospital contributes £100 towards the cost but only at 2 local places, I think. Anyway my head's shaved ready for the FEC effect hair loss. I have some nice turbans and pretty scarves. A wig would only be for best and when I see my Dad with dementia who does not know I have cancer. Hair still growing and realise surprisingly I still have a fair bit of my own colour after years of dying it light brown. My son kindly described my hair as 'leopard'! Look forward to hearing from you and love to all on this journey, Hannah x",

I finished my last Herceptin treatment in September and with that in mind had booked on a Breast Cancer Care's Moving Forward course. It's a weekly 3 hour course for 4 weeks at my hospital and is for people who are post- breast cancer treatment. Then there are the Haven and Maggie's Centres in some parts of the country. Don't suffer in silence. There's lots of support out there from people who have been through or know what you are going through. I know you say you don't want to be dominated by your cancer but it is part of your life experience and I'm not sure it can be shelved just like that. Also, be kind to yourself. It is early days. I am 18 months on from diagnosis and am only now getting my energy levels back. Hannah x",

      "Content": "KatieF I've just been diagnosed with breast cancer.  I'm to have a mastectomy, Herceptin and chemotherapy.  Has anyone any tips that might help me through this?   The mastectomy doesn't bother me as much as the chemotherapy.  I survived Anal Cancer thirteen years ago and can't quite believe I have to battle again. Hi Katie, You sound to me like a true fellow traveller. I had surgery for rectal cancer just 2 years ago which was successful and was diagnosed with Her2+ breast cancer this April. I had 3 lots of FEC-T and 3 lots of Docetaxol chemo, followed by a WLE (lumpectomy) and am currently awaiting radiotherapy. Having Herceptin jabs and Anastrazole tablets to get rid of oestrogen. Chemotherapy gets progressively more fatiguing as you progress through the treatment, so rest and sleep whenever you need to and pace yourself. Sooooo - chemo tips. Use the mouthwash regularly that the hospital will prescribe for you even before you get any mouth ulcers. It may just stop any developing. Eat foods in tasty sauces because chemo will severely blunt your tastebuds. You'll probably get a very dry mouth so drink lots of water. I found those Haribo Tangfastic sweets and any boiled mint or fruit sweets were great during chemo. I also enjoyed tinned fruit salad. Not things I usually crave! Also pickles, gherkins and tomato sauce with main meals. If you are offered a PICC line for chemo then do take it especially if, like me, you have 'shy' veins. They can also take blood samples through it very easily. Best wishes, Hannah",

I've always been a bit overweight but more so now following treatments and being on Anastrozole tablets. I used an HRT vaginal cream for a few years after an early menopause so maybe that added to my risk of getting breast cancer slightly. When I was first diagnosed I beat myself up over not finding a lump the size of a golfball in my breast straight away. Neoadjuvant chemo shrank it right down so I need not have got so stressed but that's what shock does to you. I don't plan on acquiring any more cancers, but it happens! Hannah",
