      "Content": "Hi frillyflower Im 47 as was called for a early mammogram, our doctors are a part of the pilot scheme selecting women from the age of 47. OMG  thanks they did i had no clue, signs or symptons at all. Listen to the doc's advice and the BCN ask as many questions as you need. They most likely heard it all before and will be able to help, reassure and guide you at all times. My hospital is brillant and send me all copies of reports that are sent to my GP after my appointments and they have explained it all to me in easy understanding language... see if your hospital does this , also helps to understand it slightly better. This online community is also fantastic not just from the support from every lovely member but using the search option at the top you can also find articles and previous discussions which might help you understand by just searching on a word, question, most likely you will find help etc. Found this valuable to questions that raise up in your mind a silly o'clock times!!! Not easy from the start but once the initial shock as eased just think each day, each treatment/op etc is one day nearer to kicking cancer ar**, 1 day nearer to the end of treatment  and ringing that bell Love and hugs Coll xx ",

      "Content": "Good morning What a dilema, i would be the same as you in thinking both ways and which way to go. (I was in same situation) 1) want op asap to get on track for treatment and each day/treatment is one more day to completion. 2) 2 weeks is not going hurt waiting i would have thought but im not medically trained. The surgeon's advice is the best i would have thought but she will be on the cautious side if you haven't healed/recovered from your 1st op. I asked my consultant if we could book holiday before my chemo starts and advised yes if in UK only in case i needed the hospital, but had to be fully healed in op areas. We decided to cancel our holiday and we have had weekends away (1-2 hours away on coast) and decided we are having the once in a life time holiday after all treatment done. If you cancel holiday make sure you get your medical paperwork for your holiday insurance. Let me know how you decide but either way, take it easy , feet up and relax Love and hugs Xxx",

      "Content": "Hi. Being on here is the best step you have taken. I read a lot of the posts (big help right from the begining) but dont post often. I was diagnosed 14th feb (what a way to celebrate valentines day!!!). Diagnosis was 21mm invasive lobular. I had a WLE and SNB on the 15th March. 2 out of 3 nodes tested positive and the 3rd node not defined so had a full clearance on 19th April. They all (12) came back clear but because of my ki 67 test results, i am having EC chemo (start on 8th june) then radio therapy. Listen to your body, this will help in every way. Im always on the go but this has taught me different. By being on here you find plenty of reading and helping to understand and always an ear or 2 to lean on.  The ladies/gents on here are full of help, understanding and guidance. You are never alone. Your mind goes into overdrive, only natural but it does ease but you will have moments we all do. Omg emotions go into overdrive and above, i have never cried as much (soppy over the simple things). My other half just so supportive but when soppy moment comes he just turns it around to make me laugh. Best thing to say is it wont beat you, dont live in fear as this can be treatable like lots of members have said, and just a temporary diversion on the road of life. Always here if needed Love Coll xxx",

I had a WLE and SNB on 15th March. 2 nodes tested positive and 3rd no defined answereven after further testing. Consultant confirmed this one was a rogue lol. I also had a lengthy discussion with my consultant and breast team and was offered to trial and wait to see what outcome/route to take or full axillary clearance. I opted for the clearance has i wanted to cut all the little nasties chances as possible. This was done on the 19th April. I followed all the exercises from the begining and had full movement at all time. These came back clear :). But my KI 67 result means i do have to go through chemo ( start 8th June) followed by radio therapy. I will also be on tamoxifen etc for 10 years.   I have suffered with lymphodema and erythema but on anitbiotics now into 3rd week. I also have been drained 3 times (my surgeon does not put drains in), so was a bit weird from having to start with feeling under arm like rugby ball to 2nd time a melon to 3rd time an apple!!! But i felt okay to good 97% of the time. Because my body doesn't like medication i do struggle with pain relief etc but not had to take much with these ops. Taken anti immflam tablets just to help with the swelling etc. To be honest wouldn't change my decision regards the node clearance., just wasn't giving the 'little nasties or aliens\" as we call them as little chance as possible. My consultant and BCN went over everything again with me and fully explained everything to my partner. But after chatting go members on here and researching (not google) i kind of already decided if tested positive what i would do. My consultant let me make the decision but agreed was the best answer. You will be fine, if you need further support the members on here or macmillan support line is so helpful. Please let us know what you decide and how you get on. Love and hugs xxx",

I was offered the trial and for the computer to decide on clearance or extra radiotherapy to the axilla, but i turned this down. I wanted to decide and wanted to make sure that i had chance to remove any \"nasties\" has i could.  My test (KI 67) came back and advised to do chemo and followed by radiotherapy. Again my consultant discussed it all with me and my partner and said she would support me with my choice. I did all my exercises and only had moderate pain but easy mangeable. My main problem but was well managed by my consultant and BCn and care team. (Moderate lymphodema and erythema). I have had to be drained 3 times but my consultant doesn't put drains in. 1st time had a rugby ball swelling (642 mls) drained. 2nd time melon size (330mls) 3rd time an apple (65mls) cleared. More discomfort than actual pain  and you dont feel them drain it until its gone down and you feel more comfortable and easier to move your arm back down your side. When i first saw my oncolgist she said  i had made the right decision and the next treatments would catch any little \"rogues\" that may have gone walk about. This made me content that i have done everything i can to cut down the chance of recurrence. Look after yourself and let us know how you get on Love and hugs Xxxx",

I used to get a little annoyed if things were not done on time, but now say sod it!. I think the waiting for results etc takes ages but on the other side also dont feel feet have touched ground with apointments nearly every week until op's then waiting the 2 weeks for results. I had to wait 3 weeks fot the results on the SNB has they had to send off for clearer result. Now had to sit and wait for onco appointment (they advised 2-3weeks) to start thd ball rolling for chemo etc. This gives us time to heal but now eorried wigh tbe infection if this is going to delay getting started. My body does not like medication, so every time they had to tweak the meds to stabilise me. So i started feeling yukky last night with the anti biotics and was sat doing word searches till 3 this morning after taking anti sickness meds to help ease! So actually dreading chemo and the conversations with the onco team. I so dreading they they say no due to my history with medication but i want to try and want rid of this crap in my body. So now sat here with feet up chilling lol Love and hugs Coll xxx",

I worked up to the day before surgery so my head was totally \"mashed\" (my job is very full on) but as well as home have a very supportive company to work for. The best advice i can give is make notes of questions you want to ask or take someone with you, so they can listen to.

So when these happen i can only take naproxen. I can not take any morphine based medication has my body will not accept it (took a massive argument in hospital after ops that i can't take even co-codomol, this was after 1st op that they realised after being really ill with morphine (was out of it when given).
