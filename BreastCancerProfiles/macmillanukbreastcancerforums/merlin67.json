      "Content": "Hello Lovely ladies I want to thank you Helen and sarah for your help and advice. IÂ have my first session 23rd and do feel positive and need to get on with it. I think it is the fear of the unknown that plays on the mind. I have 2 daughters 30 and 28. the eldest lives in Singapore and is finding it so hard to be away from me. I received my treatment plan today. Hooray! This will help me to plan a bit better. I some fantastic work colleagues who have already bought me anti bac spray, ginger drinks, water bottle a journal and a blanket. The side effects seem to be so different for everyone so will wait and see what combination I end up with. I do feel very positive and will keep you updated",
