    "Content": "I know what you mean. I had a mastectomy in June 2014 and found it very hard to find nice underwear. I particularly missed underwires as whilst my right breast is a silicone prosthesis my left still needs support and I missed the shape underwired gave me. As someone has said, you don't have to buy pocketed mastectomy bras. Any bra with a full cup will take a prosthesis. You can sew a pocket in the cup or ask at your breast unit about a service to sew pockets into regular bras. My breast unit will do this for free. You just need to be sure the bra has a full cup so that the prosthesis is completely held by the cup. You also don't have to have any kind of pocketed bra to wear a prosthesis. As long as the bra is full cup you can just pop the prosthesis in and the cup will hold it. It won't fall out, trust me. I don't wear pocketed bras at all now. I did have trouble with the silicone being directly next to my skin though; it got hot, stuck to my skin and caused tiny blisters. I fashioned a little cover out of an old pair of tights and now I have no problems at all. I've even gone back to underwires sometimes too, but you have to be careful that any wires are clear of any scar tissue and that you have healed adequately. If you do that then I reckon underwires, every now and again for short periods is fine.",
