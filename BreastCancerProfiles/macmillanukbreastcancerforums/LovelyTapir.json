      "Content": "Hi everyone, I'm just wondering if anyone else is in the ROSCO study? I'm starting my chemo tomorrow, T first then FEC later if needed. I'm slightly apprehensive (to say the least!) and wondering if anyone else has had the Docetaxel first? My Research nurse says it'll make me achy rather than sickly which comes as a great relief but I'd love to know what you guys think too.  It's great to have such a supportive community here! Sarah",

      "Content": "Well that was an \"interesting\" week and a half! I had my first chemo (Docetaxel & cyclophosphamide) on 17th and was fine until the Tuesday night when I started being sick with diarrhoea. That lasted until I was finally admitted to hospital on Saturday. It turns out the steroids had affected my blood sugar and I needed to be given lots of fluids and insulin! I got home yesterday and am now getting on with the more normal side effects! My hair is going quickly now, I may take it all off tomorrow but worst of all is the loss of taste. I'm finding it really hard to eat anything when everything either tastes of nothing or disgusting. Yet still my blood sugar is too high- grrrrr Hope everyone else is doing ok - I'm really dreading my 2nd cycle Sarah",

      "Content": "Hello everyone, Thanks for the welcome! I'm quite new to all this I was diagnosed on 23rd June, had a Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy a week ago which was clear (phew!) and am due to start Chemo next Friday. Then will come a lumpectomy and radiotherapy . I am, quite frankly, terrified! Though reading all the useful and supportive posts on here is helping... I'm not worried too much about losing my hair (though I'll probably cry buckets when it actually happens). It's everything else - the nails (I've only just stopped biting them and love them dearly!), I have rubbish veins so not sure they'll hold up and as for all the gastric related issues - it just doesn't bear thinking about   Oops - I've just realised how much of a whinge that looks like! I'm remaining outwardly positive despite the above. It's great to have somewhere where I can be slightly less positive and know that you all understand! Thank you",
