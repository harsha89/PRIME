    "Content": "Hello lovelies  I\u2019m back again, I found a big lump just above my nipple a month ago, my husband forced me to go to the docs so I went last Thursday, she didn\u2019t seemed concerned about lump number 1, but she did find a second lump I didn\u2019t know was there, she said there was some thickening around it and it was quite deep under the skin and it wasn\u2019t firm. She tried to get me an appointment there and then but none available, it was a two week wait for urgent as she\u2019s said she wasn\u2019t concerned about the second lump.  Last year I found a lump and it took 6 week an two doc appointments before I was scanned am came back clear, I received a letter in the post regarding my appointment last year.  This morning I had a text from my doctors asking me to comeback in to collect my paper work and appointment, I thought that was far too quick for it to be nothing, and why do I needs to go and collect. I got the letter and it\u2019s was different ro last time, this one says you end been referred for an urge to allintment to consider the possibility of cancer, etc and im advised to bring someone with me.  It\u2019s also a fast tracked appointment.  Totally different from last time, my appointment is in the afternoon as well, basically I\u2019d like to know if anyone hasn\u2019t received the same letter and does this mean Its most likely to Be cancer from your experience? Are suspected cancer patients given a different letter? I have two small children and im very angry right now, obviously you won\u2019t  know till the day which is then 20th next Friday but im just so angry about it all, in case it isn\u2019t cancer and I don\u2019t survive and haven to leaven my husband and children.  Thank you xxxxx",
