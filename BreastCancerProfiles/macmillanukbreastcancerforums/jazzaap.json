      "Content": "To cut a long story short I had some soreness on my nipple, thought it was chaffing but appeared to leak clear fluid from the areola I think (at the time). It got itchy around that area and couldn't wear tops without covering up my nipple as it rubbed. Every time the GP pinched my nipple to see if she could express anything it felt as if it needed to pop! That's went I noticed and white area when the nipple was firm, it looked like a spot under the skin. Well I decided to give it a squeeze and it was like it was plugged with a fatty type white substance, much like plugged pours. I also mentioned this and that it felt tingley and inflamed after squeezing and there was sometimes some flaking on it around the nipple. Any way, I've had loads of visits to the GP, bloods, BC visit for an ultrasound and inspection of the nipple and always told it looks ok. I'm not sure if I'm being paranoid or if I demand a biopsy. This stress was made worse after learning about pagets. Should I push more another BC visit or leave it alone? The last GP I saw said he was truly stumped but will speak to the BC and see how to manage it as it doesn't feel it's a a sinister issue. I'm male.",

      "Content": "I did call Macmillan and she mentioned about seeing dermatology. I think I'll make an appointment tomorrow with the GP and so they will probably be so sick of me they will send me to one Makes it worse that my mate had pagets so I know some of the symptoms and know how incredibly sneaky it is! Maybe it's just me but as a male without a lump it seems like you're put down as an anxious medical mystery. Thanks! Be well!",
