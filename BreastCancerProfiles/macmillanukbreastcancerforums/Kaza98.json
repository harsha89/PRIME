      "Content": "Hi I am also new to here! I had a recall after my mammogram... had all the tests but before the biopsies was told, if I wanted, I could here my initials diagnosis. I had a cancerous lump with lots of floating calcium dots! (I\u2019ve googled the names but can\u2019t remember them at the moment ! ) I then went for the biopsies... one of the lump then about 30 (that felt like 100!) in the \u2018floaters! I go tomorrow to see the consultant to hear exactly what stage I\u2019m at and what procedures I will have.  It\u2019s all surreal at the moment and I know you will all have been there! Slightly more difficult at the moment as my wonderful step dad has just had a terminal diagnosis I also have fibromyalgia, which robbed me of my dream job,  Deputy Principal, and this is now going to affect my job as a private tutor! However, I\u2019m a fighter, a warrior and I WILL kick my cancer\u2019s butt into another stratosphere!!  Hope everyone here is the best that they can be and I wish everyone success in their treatment   Karen xx ",
