Everyone here  has been so  helpful and encouraging it really does help. xxx Alirose ",

      "Content": "Hi Chloe cat, I have just picked up on this thread and want to wish you well you are an inspiration , sadly I went down the traditional route having been diagnosed after a particularly nasty visit at  a  Breast screening clinic. The hospital advised I had 40mm DCIS with a 4 mm spiculative mass and was asked what I thought about breast conservation or a mastectomy . The start of the nightmare . Too long a story , but this all happened last August and I'm still suffering pain from the free tram flap surgery . I am in the middle of a complaint still trying to get information . Please do what you feel comfortable with do not allow people to pressure you in to making any decisions that you do not feel comfortable with . Me I face a life time of regrets being scarred internally , externally and nerve ending pain in my breast bone , my armpit and a seroma above the new belly button that was left to re-absorb , a year later guess what it's still there.  I have tried stress management , all the self help books and a positive confidence building course , but they do not help with pain. Finally I found out that Tamoxifen only provided  a 1- 3% benefit - the side effects included excruciating leg cramps which lasted for days and left me limping ,  stomach cramps , bloating on top of the seroma etc . I stopped  it and my mood swings stopped. Again poor info provided by the Hospital. I now attend a a private therapist who carries out the Bowen technique and used something similar to a tens machine which is at last helping with the back and stomach pains. I also eat a very high fibre diet , I have too another result of the operation. After finally obtaining my medical notes I read that the cancer was 3 seperate foci in total measuring 20mm with tubular formation and intermitant DCIS 11.9mm. The cancer was very rare and very slow growing had not spread outside my then breast and according to my research very unlikely to spread. So keeping asking ALL your health providers  for information and good luck with my sincere best wishes. Alirose",

      "Content": "Hi Chloe Cat,  good luck and I'm keeping my fingers crossed about   the trial , it sounds amazing.There is some info from American websites , as I'm sure you've read. Best thing I ever bought was a pedometer and it is amazingly encouraging by showing  what you can achieve . I was a very positive person before all of this and I feel that I'm coming back but it's  very very slow. I have found that walking helps the grey matter and of course the fresh air is a tonic for your skin.Keeps the circulation and lymphatic system moving which is is essential when your body is needing all the help it can get. I'm also working my way through the Rainbow Diet. Keep well  Kind Regards , Alirose",

      "Content": "Hi , I was recently diagnosed with dcis and a  large area of calcification  and have been finding it hard to cope as very anxious , needle phobia etc . My bc nurse advised going to the Maggie's centre  and it was one of the best things I have ever done I felt  supported and can talk freely about how I feel . I am starting a stress reduction course to help me to manage my fears and they also advised me about another centre in Glasgow  called Cancer support Scotland who also provide support to relatives, friends and carers. They provide complimentary therapies ie/. aromatherapy,chiropody,massage techniques to name but a few . The setting for both the centres are very peaceful and comfortable and if you are able to access I thoroughly recommend them . Hope this info is of help as we all know sleep and relaxation are a necessity but not always so easy to have. Love and hugs to all. Alirose",
