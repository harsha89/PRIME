The good thing is those feelings do start to get less and less frequent. I don't think they ever go away, but there will be moments when you will be more relaxed. I'm a total pessimist but even I've had several moments when I felt totally \"normal\" like it all never happened. Other similar have probably mentioned mindfulness which is basically just focusing on now rather than thinking about what-ifs. Hope things improve soon Mark",

I finished treatment (mastectomy, chemo, Herceptin) for (male) breast cancer last year and just on Tamoxifen now. Chemo affects people differently depending on what the combination is etc. It\u2019s definitely not pleasant but you can get through it. The one thing I found hard was the fatigue......I was shocked at how tired and drained I was. Little walks helped sometimes, but it is hard. The key thing is to try and get lots of rest, which I know will be hard if you have children to look after. It might be worth checking what support you can get from friends and family, because it\u2019s very hard going through chemo.....although, like I said if affects everyone differently so I don\u2019t want to stress you out.

      "Content": "Hi Forza Sorry to hear about your dad. I was diagnosed with male breast cancer last May, after finding a lump. Mine was stage 2 and HER2 positive as well as oestrogen positive. Treatment involved a mastectomy then four chemo treatments (TC). I too ended up in hospital with sepsis after white blood cells dropped. It's a pretty rough ideal. My chemo finished in October. Now I have an Herceptin injection every 3 weeks and on Tamoxifen for 10 years. They didn't tell me afterwards that I was \"cured\" as such, they just explained the next treatments. I did ask once how they'd know if I was cured and the Consultant said, in a nutshell, that if they were other symptoms that developed, then they'd investigate. This can lead to paranoia about whether it will come back but, thats a normal reaction with most people who have had cancer. I have to have heart checks every 3 months (as Herceptin can affect your heart) and blood tests. I see the Oncologist more frequently than once every 3 months at the moment. They tend to see me more frequently if any heart/blood tests show anything concerning. I'm not sure what a \"key worker\" but in your position I'd contact your dad's Oncologist and ask for a meeting to discuss all the issues. I hope your dad improves quickly. Good luck. Mark",

I had nausea but it wasn't too bad as the anti-sickness tablets worked quite well. I'd contact your chemo nurses if the anti-sickness tablets don't work well. I also had a bit of a dry throat but not until the second chemo session. I found the first chemo manageable and started to feel more alive by about the second week after, although the tiredness does stay. One thing that may help is if you keep a diary of your symptoms for each day after chemo, then you can behold up a picture of what happens. For example on all my \"day 8's\" after chemo, I felt very ill. But also bear in mind each session can be different and they are generally cumulative so the more you have, the worse you can feel.

I had the mastectomy in June and started chemo in August. Initially I was to have 6 chemo sessions, but due to my height and weight it was changed to 4 sessions. My last chemo was about 6 weeks ago. Now I just have Herceptin injections every 3 weeks and started on Tamoxifen tablets. The mastectomy scar doesn't stand out too much, but probably as I'm black it blends in more. Chemo wasn't pleasant but it helps If you take it one day at a time. The main thing is to mention the side effects that you're struggling with, to the oncologist/nurses. Once I'd discovered the lump and started on the \"cancer treadmill\" it was very stressful but what helped was reading the info the hospital provided and discussing concerns with the oncologist and chemo nurses. Again what helps is trying to take things one step at a time as the whole thing feels less overwhelming. Hope this helps a bit.  Mark",
