      "Content": "Apparently the swelling is just post op and will take 6 months to go. But on the plus side he has cleared me 3 weeks early to have radiotherapy. Although I have planned round the 6 weeks recoup time that I was originally told as I am going to see friends compete at Paralympics and my son starts school. So once that week is over I will start RT. Which is 6 weeks post op. Never imagined I would be ok by 3. And I only have to wear the post op bra for another 2 weeks. Then I can swim yehhhhhh. Until RT starts anyway. Oh how I miss the swimming pool.",

      "Content": "hi new to group was diagnosed in feb early march with Her2+  ER+  breast cancer had TAC chemo 6 cycles and 1 herceptin on its own then had mastectomy with total axcillary clearance then DIEP flap reconstruction on the 6th aug and had herceptin again on friday so did not miss a treatment my question is everything is so swollen my arm and around my lower section of breast I have not seen the plastic surgeon again see him tomorow but nurses say it is fine.  my breast feels so heavy like I have not brestfed in over a day and feel full and tight.  is this normal?  I generally feel well and coped not to badly with the chemo so really cannot complain.  to be honest I think I am just looking for a little reasurance and rough idea to how long the swelling will last.  thanks in advance.  tc",

      "Content": "I too had sore eyes I lost a lot of my eyelashes but not all. I told nurse who sent me to gp who prescribed chloramphenicol drops. I did not use them as you cannot use them and ware contacts. Boots tired eye and refreshing eye drops for contact lenses worked fine as the gp told me it was a virus. And I knew it wasn't as I had not passed it to my boys. And besides chloramphenicol is an antibiotic and won't work on viruses. So I figuredni just had dry eyes as I was loosing my lashes.",
