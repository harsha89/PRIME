      "Content": "Hi my name is Lisa and I had my left sided mastectomy with sentinel lymph node removal on the 29th November,  I don't normally join online groups but feel lost and lonely at the min and quite sore.  The pain I am feeling is like a burning feel across where my breast has been....I have already had a pint fluid drained off and it looks like it has refilled a bit.  I am taking paracetamol and ibroprofen for pain and using a hot water bottle so I can get some sleep. I was wondering is this normal and how long does it take roughly to settle down.  I feel like a softy because I normally handle pain quite well and when you look at some of the stories people are fine and back to work etc ....... Any information or advice would be appreciated. Thanks Lisa Maddison",
