    "Content": "I am now 8 weeks post mx and 4 weeks post ANC. I personally found the ANC the most painful. I still have a numb area in my arm and can't lift it totally but I am getting there. I admit I don't like the site where my breast was removed it's not a nice flat scar but I know down the line I am having a reconstruction. It's a lot to go through but fro somewhere you find strength. I start chemo next week so more challenges ahead. Xxx Â ",
