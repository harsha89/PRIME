I myself found a lump the end ov dec which turned out to be breast cancer i have had mastectomy with reconstruction on 13 dec, i got my results from the histology which shown that the nodes hadnt been infected but they still want me to have a course ov chemo which imnot lookin forward to at all!!! The wait for the results is the worst isnt it as u just want to know wat you are facing the uncertainty drives u mad!!! Stay strong as you are i prepared myself for the worst mentally Â in that at least iwas prepared for whatever they told me and that way anything less was a bonus!! Hope evrything will be ok hun will keep my fingers crossed for u. Take care n try to keep busy!!!! xxx",
