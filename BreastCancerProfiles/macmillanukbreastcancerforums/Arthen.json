      "Content": "Hi folks just wondering if anyone is having herceptin treatment and taking anastrozole as well. I've had chemo and radiotherapy and think I was quite lucky with side effects etc but at the moment feeling worse on herceptin and anastrozole...aching everywhere, just recently been getting nose bleeds. Is anyone in this same position. Xxx",

I have got appointments coming up so will mention it then as well. Will keep taking the painkillers and get out in this lovely weather, always makes you feel better. Xxx",
