      "Content": "Hi I think we deserve our moaning days, I'm only just starting my journey, lumpectomy and two nodes removed 18-12-15, results and plan 11-1-16 terrified the waiting is awful! I wouldn't beat yourself up about being fed up you've already been through alot, and no matter what other people say they don't understand unless they've been there. Counselling will be good for you, try not to worry about weight you can always lose that, I'm sure you, all of us return to our old selves at some stage, just a little chipped round the edges!!! Take care x",

      "Content": "Hi I was diagnosed grade 2 ducts on the 30 th November. I was invited for an early mammogram out of the blue as part of a trial for under 50s. The shock is something that can't be described ! I  had my lump 1 cm removed on the 18 th Dec and first two nodes, cancer in one but not second, I get all my results on 11 th jan I'm worried but hopeful that I won't need chemo just radiotherapy. One lady said to me the only advice I can give is to go with it, you can't change anything so just go with it. The operation was fine and I was home the same day. I've been in work for a few hours today so not bad after ten days. Try as much as you can to be positive it does help. You will have bad days and good days, if you want to cry then cry that helps too. Cath x",

      "Content": "Hi I was diagnosed end of November, had lumpectomy and sentinel node removed, thankfully it wasn't in the second node so I think that's good. Get results and treatment plan in January, the surgeon has mentioned chemo but not 100 percent sure yet. I too have long thick hair and I'm going to donate it and go for a short cut, as I think it will be easier than seeing it fall out, I don't think I am brave enough to shave it. I couldn't find any Facebook groups either. Positivity is the key I think, although it's very hard sometimes, good luck with your treatment. Cath x",

Supposed to get results 11.1.16 the hospital rang on wed to say it will be another week due to bank holidays etc, the waiting is awful I just want to know my plan etc, my head is full of what ifs! I can only cling on to the fact that I'm sure they wouldn't of left me over four weeks since op if it was bad? I just can't think of anything but getting those results !!! Did everyone else feel like this ? Cath x ",
