      "Content": "I am on day 2 of 15 and I'm already pink and feeling slightly tight and scratchy, I'm using Aloe, Aveeno and Aquamax and drinking lots of water so fingers crossed as I have a holiday booked 4 days after I finish eek. The annoying thing is that I still have an open wound from my surgery in January, I wanted to delay the rads but the oncologist has assured me I'll be fine. ",

      "Content": "Oh no I wonder why that is, you would think it would cool it down. My radiographers haven't really given me much advice except to apply the cream they have given as often as I like and to drink plenty. They mentioned nothing about not applying before or straight after as some people on here were told so I'm applying the cream an hour or so before the appointment and then slap on loads of Aloe vera in the changing room afterwards, I'm only on number 4 and had redness on the second time but touch wood it's been ok so far, early days yet I guess but fingers crossed. ",
