      "Content": "Hi Annabel, Ive had a few 'down' days myself lately. Regarding family and friends, im sick of hearing \"im sorry..\" too. I feel like all people want to do is talk about the big C around me. Like cancer has taken my identity away from me as well. I even had someone phone me to ask me how im feeling. I told them 'oh not to good today ...' their reply 'well its just the chemotherapy, your sure to feel rubbish\". in other words, what do you expct, jst get on with it. Or another person kept starring at my bust when i spoke to them. I dont think people know whats best to ay or how to react around you. My best advice when feeling this low is turn your phone off and ignore! I also find playing music helps, its drowns out those negative thoughts that are circulating at the minute. I have also been writing a diary. Everyday, i just sit for a while on my own and write literally anything that flies through my mind. I dont read it, just scribble down how i feel at that moment in time. It feels almost that your realising all your emotions without breaking down crying all the time, or talking to a loved one or relative who doesnt really know what your going through. Hope to have been of help today. Lisa x",

      "Content": "Hi there, I had my third cycle of taxotere/cyclophosphamide (3 more to go!) and i have had to have the injection 24 hours with each of my cycles. Maybe contact your breast care nurse or the clinc you usual have your treatment at to enquire whether you will still be needing it or not. I usually have headaches and really bad aching joints after my treatment, usually last 3-4 days. I usually take paracetamol and ibuprofen every 6 hours, taking my temp in between, this usually takes the worse of the pain away but it is usually still there. All i can sugget is to take your painkillers and rest up, uually after a day or two the pain usually calms down and you will be able totake your pain meds less. Hope you feel better soon!! Lisa x",

      "Content": "Hi Budstar, thanks for your reply. Thats exactly how Ive felt. I knew something wasnt quite right and was on the verge of tears by the time i got the hosptial. I went to my gd before hand who gave me a little pat on the back and said \"well, you will feel like this, its the treatment you are on\". Went strght to the hosptial from my gp surgery as i wanted to make absoluely certain that it was just side effects. I am slowly getting better but it really did scare me how bad i felt. When the docs where asking me questions, i couldnt even answer them properly as i literally ached from head to toe and felt rubbish. Ithink im just being over anxious as i felt so rubbish, that the \"things\" appearing were something more than an infection. Thanks again for your reply x x",

Cant help but worry when i hit a \"bump in my road\" I think having the infection has really scared me, and proved how vulnerable we can be during this journey. xx",

      "Content": "Hi Marilyn, I feel more at ease now that Ive had some replies. I think its just me being alone with my thoughts. My BC nurse is going to phone me today so i will ask her, feel much more confident going through her. I think I just really frightened of feeling so vulnerable. Ive stayed in this week, didnt really want to go anywhere until im feeling up to scratch, so my poor hubby has been in charge of everything whilst I hid away in the house. Thanks again x x.",

      "Content": "Hi everybody, Had my 3rd cycle of chemotherapy (taxotere and cyclophosphamide) just over a week ago. By the weekend, I had some really horrendous side effects, much worse than i ever experience the first two times. Took myself to get checked out at the hospital who prescribed some antibiotics for a water infection. They also sent the water sample to the lab as my water \"showed positive to a few things\". I asked like what and they said they cant be sure till the results are in from the lab. So i have been sat here, these past 4 days, worrying myself sick wondering what \"things\" could be showing up. Taking my meds like a good girl as well. Slowly getting better, but im just wondering if anybody else has had anitbiotics whilst undergoing treatment, or had an infection of some kind. Its just that im feeling REALLY wiped out even though im taking my antibiotics and i cant stop these niggling thoughts about what other \"things\" have shown up. I havent rang my doctors or oncologist as im not sure when the results will be back. Driving myself sick with worry so any advice or uplifting messages would really be appreciated!! Thanks, Lisa D",
