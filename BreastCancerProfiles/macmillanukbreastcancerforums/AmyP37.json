      "Content": "Hi, My name is Amy & im 37 years old. Ive recently been experiencing what I can only describe as an aching feeling around the front of my armpit area (its not constant), I do suffer with health anxiety which really doesnt help situations like this as I have already self-diagnosed myself with breast cancer! I saw my GP 2 weeks ago who felt around my armpit area & he confirmed he couldnt feel anything but he has referred me to the breast clinic for a scan due to my anxiety issues & to put my mind at ease. My appointment arrived yesterday for 7/1/2014 & im scared :-( ",

      "Content": "My mum was diagnosed at 55 when she had her 1st screening, was removed & she had radiotherapy & now on Tamoxifen.  My mind is running into overdrive & i know the net is a wrong thing to use at times like this so I have tried to steer clear from it. I do suffer with RSI from my last job so ive even tried to tell myself its that.  I have a tendency to think the worst i'll admit it bcus then anythin else is a bonus. My GP said he would send me for a scan to ease my mind so I presume he means an ultrasound & not the mammogram. Its the fear of the unknown getting the better of me I think. Thanks  Amy x",

I dont work im a single parent to a 12yr old boy (he knows nothing of my worry), if I had lifted something heavy or done a stint in the gym then I could explain it but I havent but I have noticed that when my anxiety levels feel high the feeling around the area is more noticeable, my anxiety really hasnt helped this situation & I know that.",

Im not in pain at all just experiencing a strained kinda feeling similar to having lifted something heavy thats all I can describe it as, ive not felt any lumps/seen any discharge but ive more or less self-diagnosed myself as having something sinister :-( Amy",
