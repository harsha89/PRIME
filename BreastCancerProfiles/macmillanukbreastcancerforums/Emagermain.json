      "Content": "Hi folks, I'm just over 3yeRs post cancer.. breast cancer her2 positive, 8/12 lymph nodes affected, mastectomy and all grade 3.  I had 6 chemos, 15 radios and 17 herceptins.  The fatigue is horrendous, I am struggling on a daily basis.  When it gets to 14.30 ish I become floored most days.  This post cancer life has left me with arthritis, unable to do the things I love anymore... just wondering if anyone else has the same issues.  All I feel I'm doing is saying the same old things to family and friends, I'm tired, can we have an early night... I'm even getting fed up of hearing myself.... :-/",

Aching is terrible, but luckily I have good pain management so its got as bad as the first.. phew.  Today is day 3 days post Docetaxel, so im wanning now, need to rest but cant sleep arghhhh.  Self injecting isn't too bad either, but the pain those injections give is grim, for me anyway, ended up swaying side to side in the middle of the night like I needed sectioning under the mental health act it was that bad.  Radio for me next too and Herceptin, I might be something like come Christmas :D   Keep smiling ladies :)",

      "Content": "Hi Noodles, I had this scarf given as a gift, it has greyhounds on it as I am greyhound had :D love the gangly devils to death bless them. I usually buy my scarf from Amazon, some really cheap ones which are good quality.. I have noted that the cotton ones are much better than the silky ones, as the silky ones seem to slink off my head and I wasn't keep... I also have some pashimas, think that's what they are called are they are fab for when its a bit nippier out as they are thicker, also from Amazon and not overly expensive.   Please have a gander on youtube at head scarf ideas, there are lots to see, or you could just make it up as I do.  I had to laugh as a few older ladies have said... ''oo I do like you're hat'' I just nodded and said thanks ...xx",

      "Content": "*waves* hello Morag...  I have had my mastectomy back in may, I bought new pjs which were front fastening and a front fastening pretty nighty. I didn't find a bra/sports bra comfy for a while but I did buy some night time maternity bras from Mothercare for when I felt able to wear them.  They are very comfy and if you ask an assistant they will guide you to the ones mastectomy ladies buy :) I have also have to inject myself for 5 days after chemo to replenish the WBC, I couldn't be faffed waiting for the nurse to come round, its not that bad really. Only one more chemo next Tuesday then its Radio... Keep strong folks.. we can get through this :D x",
