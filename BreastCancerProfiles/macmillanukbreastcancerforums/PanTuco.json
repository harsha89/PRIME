      "Content": "Hello Ginacarla That has just happened to me, yesterday at my initial Oncologists appointment, when I was fully expecting to be told I had to start chemo and be given a date, the oncologist floored me by using the NHS Predict tool that gave the result of only 3.6 % benefit from chemo - Letrozole and Radio were of more use... unfortunately she would not commit to saying \u2018it\u2019s of no use really\u2019 and left it to me to decide! Needless to say I am agonising over this - having two positive nodes meant I was certain that chemo was the next step...  Can I ask what you eventually did ? It\u2019s because I am HER neg I think, the OPTIMA trial was also an option but again, very likely that would lead to chemo and without knowing if test recommended it ... Best wishes  Thistle ",

      "Content": "Hello Jac Thank you so much for that, I was actually considering ringing my BCN but felt reluctant to bother her, she is really nice though...l have asked to see the oncologist again, I do need to get some things clarified as you say!  I really appreciate your kindness, it means a lot.... Gratefully  Pan ( sometimes Thistle.. wrong username, wrong forum ) ",
