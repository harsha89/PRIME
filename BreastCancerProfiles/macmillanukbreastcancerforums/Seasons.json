      "Content": "Hi DeliaAC I wanted to just agree with one of the other posts here.  Receiving the diagnosis is awful, it's not what any of us want to hear, but we in this community are here for you.  I too was diagnosed with breast cancer with lymph node involvement  just over a year ago now and have gone through 2 operations chemotherapy, radiotherapy and am now on Anastrazole tablets.  I was really shaken up when I was given my diagnosis as there was no-one in my family with breast cancer, however, I was allocated a breast care nurse who was really helpful and she referred me to a Counsellor who deals with cancer patients who was also very helpful.   I was lucky enough to have my husband at home and my family around me but felt I should write to you,.  Once you have your plan of treatment and start going through the journey things may get easier for you as you may feel you have more support.  I also telephoned MacMillan sometimes when I was really not coping and they were very reassuring.  Please use every support you are given.  I remember being so scared but I have managed to get through this.  Another thing that helped me was Mindfulness (living in the moment), you can get books (I got mine from the Works) or I believe there may be free on-line information about this.  I still don't sleep the best but that's me I haven't been a good sleeper for a long while. All the best - keep in touch with us all.",

      "Content": "So sorry to hear of your problems.  If it helps, my chemotherapy doctor suggested I had weekly chemotherapy as they can give lower dose steroids and Paclitaxel instead of Doxetaxel .  I had terrible mood swings with the steroids, cleaning the house from top to bottom and not sleeping when taking them 3 times a day with the FEC then sitting around in a chair, very low in mood and not able to do anything when they were wearing off.  Hence they felt that I would not cope with the higher dose steroids given with Doxetaxel. I got through the weekly chemotherapy and the lower steroids.  ",

      "Content": "Hi. I am sorry you have been diagnosed at such a young age.  I was 64.  I too was very scared and couldn't get my head around the diagnosis.  Then I went into the drop in Centre at the Cancer Unit and they were very helpful.  I then signed up to see a Cancer counsellor/psychologist . which was the best thing I ever did.  I saw her weekly, then monthly. I would as has been suggested also speak to your breast care nurse and find out whether there are any support groups or that type of thing in your area.  I had grade 2 cancer and 10 infected lymph nodes. An initial lumpectomy then a mastectomy. I had chemotherapy, radiotherapy and am  now clear of cancer after a recent CT scan.  So you can do it.  Just get the help and support you need if its available in your area. All the best.",

      "Content": "Hi Optimistic.  I haven't been to see my counsellor recently and like you have had fears of it recurring, however, she did teach me some mindfulness skills which I do when I can't get rid of these fears, basically you concentrate on your breathing until you relax and only focus on today (live one day at a time).  I also find going out and looking at nature helps or any activity that you enjoy.  You can get books on mindfulness in any book shop including the Works and I believe there is on-line mindfulness information. Also each day research improves chances of survival and better treatment for all of us should the cancer return.  We`ve coped once so lets get on and enjoy our life.  However, I do understand that it's not easy and am still struggling myself with lack of sleep and tiredness, which can be debilitating.  Hope this helps.",
