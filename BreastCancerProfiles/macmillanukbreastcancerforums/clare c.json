I was diagnosed in July ive got 3 girls under 4 the youngest being 6 months. Ive just had my 7th chemo im having double mx and lymph clearance in march. To say its been tough is an understatement. Two people inc my x sister in law have really let me down, but people who I thought would nt bother have really helped me. Illness is a funny thing if anything you ll find out who your friends are that's for sure.",
