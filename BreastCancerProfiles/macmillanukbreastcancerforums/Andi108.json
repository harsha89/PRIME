      "Content": "Hey everyone, Ive just been diagnosed with breast cancer a month ago and I'm at my consultants tomoz with regard to what is gonna happen next week when I have my surgery. I have Invasive Ductal Cancer Grade 2 in my left breast and DCIS in my right breast. I am getting nervous about it and I know it sounds silly but I keep thinking why me!! did I do something wrong to get cancer?. The nurse told me once they removed the  cancer they will decide which further treatment I will have, 3 weeks of radiotherapy or 3 months of chemo. Got to have a Sentinel node probe localisation done the day before my surgery and I am not sure what that is has I have been told that my biopsy from my lymph gland showed no cancer, has anyone had this done??. Thanks.",

I'm usually a strong person but this has knocked me for six, when I saw my BCN last week I did take a pen with me as I had some many questions but she said I was thinking too far into the future as I was asking about nipple reconstruction ect, I need to shut my mind off and just think about my surgery if that makes sense? my mom is ill at the moment so not able to come with me and my only close friend is away working so I feel alone.

I have been to see my consultant  today, he said I will have the radioactive dye to check my sentinel node if the cancer has spread to them they will remove all my lymph glands under my left armpit but if they come back clear he wont. on the day of my surgery I need to be at the hospital for 7am, they are gonna put a wire in so they know where the DCIS is in my right breast and on my left breast they are going to do a therapeutic mammoplasty ( I will lose my nipple on my left breast). Then I will have radiotherapy on my left breast but they did say I may need chemo as well but wont know till the remove the cancer, I know its silly but I cried when they said that as I don't want to lose my hair, someone told me about a cold mask for your head, as anyone used one?? do they work? where do you get them from?? lol hear I go again thinking too far along the road instead of taking one day at a time. I know its ER 7/8, he said that when I was on HRT it may have made the cancer grow quicker as I check myself every couple of mths and there was no lump at Christmas. love to you all Andrea xxx.",
