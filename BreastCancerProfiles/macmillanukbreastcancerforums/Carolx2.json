    "Content": "I had an operation in Dec to remove lump and lymph nodes, the operation went well but since then i have had problems every time i need to give blood as they can never get a vien, i have had 1 lot of chemo and was due to have the 2nd last week, but due to the problem with the vein they were unable to do it, as i still have 5 more sessions (2 FEC then 3 Taxotere)Ihave been told I have to have a Hikman line fitted, This will make my chemo over 2 weeks late and am worried about this, has anyone else had to have this and does anyone know why the veins go like this after the op, I never had any problems before.This is the first time I have looked at the forum but have found alot of my worries have been answered.Another problem i have is coming to terms with loosing my hair, i coped very well with everything else but every time i look at my hair (or the bald patches)i get very upset and am paraniod that everyone is looking at me in my wig and that it will blow off, my husband says i should shave the rest of my hair of as i am constantly getting upset everytime i look at the bald patches, but i cant bring myself to do it, am i being stupid? why is the hair causing me more distress than the cancer itself? please help. thankyou Carol",
