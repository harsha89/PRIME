    "Content": "Hi, you have put into words exactly what I have been thinking, I finish 7 months of chemo in September and then in October have an hour long \"Survivorship Meteing\" with my Specialist, strange name for the meeting but heyho.  Although the hospital letters so no further evidence of invasive or in situ disease and lymph nodes removed, all clear, I still feel that I am living with breast cancer, so difficult to get your head around that you have cancer, you had cancer and now hopefully you don't, and there is the bug bear the word \"hopefully!\". The only thing I can say is that we must all pretty much have the same thoughts in this not so exclusive club, but it did make me feel better reading your blog, thanks Spudly, cos we aint alone in this uncertain journey.  ",
