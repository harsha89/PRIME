    "Content": "Im about to start my treatment in a week beginning with breast conserving surgery, Im hoping for clear sentinal nodes so I only have to get radiotherapy then tamoxifen (fingers crossed for the best outcome of a bad lot) Ive been wading through tonnes of books looking for info on all the other crap that comes along with forced menopause. I had a subtotal hysterectomy 2 yrs ago as a way of being able to keep my ovaries. I know what you mean, as if cancer isnt enough its so feckin unfair, Im a bit of a basket case at the best of times god knows what kind of monster Im going to turn into :-(",
