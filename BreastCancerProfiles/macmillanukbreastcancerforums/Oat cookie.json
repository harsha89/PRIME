    "Content": "Hi, I am about to start my last Tac. I have had pretty bad leg pain, by cycle 3 I was pacing round the house crying and begging my husband to 'do something'. The doc explained that it was caused by the injection that I have the day after my chemo. The injection encourages the production of white blood cells in your bones and it is this that causes the bone pain. The good news is that your doc can prescribe serious pain killers that make a huge difference. I take Tramadol and paracetamol for a few days each cycle and experience very little pain. Talk to your nurse, you do not need to suffer. Best wishes.",
