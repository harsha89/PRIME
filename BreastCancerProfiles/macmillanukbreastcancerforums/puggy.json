    "Content": "Hi werymum, Things must be very difficult for you at the moment, I had breast cancer in 2006 and had a lumpectomy it is important to do the exercises they give you for your arms when you have had lymph nodes removed they are very simple to do and they will help, I still have numbness on my right side but even now I exercise it to keep it as strong as possible, I hope all goes well for you and your daughter try and keep your chin up and be strong I know it is difficult. take care and let us know how you and your daughter get onÂ  Puggy",
