      "Content": "Hi Fox, I agree with Sheena that it's perhaps a bit early to buy a bra.  Once my surgeons and I agreed on the type of reconstruction (TUG) (after BMX) I'll be having I was given advice by the surgeon and the breast care nurses at the hospital what type and what size I'll need.  Before that I was making a lot of assumptions that turned out to be wrong so wait for advice specific to your needs. I bought my bras from www.thebraclinic.co.uk.  No VAT is chargeable.  They have special surgical bras.  In my case, I was told that I would need to wear the bra 24/7 after surgery (except in the shower LOL) for 6-8 weeks.  I bought 4 with zip or buttons in the front so I would not have to reach around the back (because I'll be having auxilliary node sampling).  I was told that the cup size should match my cup size but the chest size, ie, 34, should be a size larger, ie, 36. Hope this helps.  Good luck with your surgery!",

      "Content": "Hi Hannah, Jayne has some great advice.  I agree that moving around is a good thing.  I couldn't get out and walk much during Taxotere bit I found gentle arm and leg movement to be very helpful.  You mom wants to prevent stiffness which will add to the pain.  I had nerve pain down my arms and legs into my hands, feet, toes, fingers.  I stayed in bed a lot but finally called my breast care nurse and GP and they organized some amitryptiline (sp?) which helped me cope with the worst of the pain, calmed me down and helped me sleep.  I also took ibuprofen and paracetamol, but again, took doctors/nurse advice on dosage.  The only problem with taking things like paracetamol and ibuprofen is that they will bring any temperature your mum may have down and mask any infection.  So, it's not always recommended.  I'm sure there are other pain relief meds that could be recommended though. Hannah, everyone is different - everyone reacts differently to the taxotere.  I'm 8 weeks post last chemo (taxotere) and I'm still having some pain but not the same as during the taxotere.  I've learned to cope with it and my oncologist says I will recover about 6 months post chemo. I hope your mum feels better soon.",

I coped with the fear by reading as much as possible about my type of breast cancer.  I just took the information in and didn't judge it.  For one thing, I ignored the statistics because everyone is different. I coped by being very positive.  My oncologist said this attitude helped me through the worst of it.  I had bilateral mastectomy and chemo to treat mine.  My positive attitude helped me get through the surgery and treatment.  I also listened to classical music a lot, read a lot of books . . . I did all the things that I love doing.  I did them with passion.  I cuddled my cats.  I loved my partner.  I enjoyed every moment that I could enjoy because I couldn't stop the crummy moments from happening. This is a good place to come for support.  Be angry if you want to - get it out.  Being positive doesn't mean repression your angry or sad emotions.   There is loads of information available on this website.  I also want to recommend the breastcancer.org website - their community discussion board is huge and very detailed. Big hugs to you Gina. ",

The best way to get help seems to be to get a high fever and infection and get into the hospital - even then, they only tell me what I need to know unless I grill them - and so many of us in hospital waited hours in our beds just to get a doctor to come look at us - I kept getting promises that the breast surgeons would come and look at me and they never did - no explaination.  I guess I'm learning to live with it.   When I see my oncologist every 4-5 weeks he does answer questions but he says different things than the breast surgeons and reconstruction surgeons (they all give a bit different advice. They say we shouldn't look on the internet for answers  - but how else are we going to find out? Okay, I got my anger out there.  Thanks for listening.",

      "Content": "Dear Libby, poor you, I understand how you feel and I'm so sorry you are having such a hard time with the Taxotere.  I had 3 sessions and I found them extremely difficult.  Call your breast care nurse or whoever is co-ordinating your care and tell them about the pain.  I was prescribed amitryptaline which helped with the worst of the pain.  I also took paracetamol and ibuprofen, alternating doses.  There are other meds and supps that your oncologist may prescribe but do get them to prescribe you something. Taxotere was very constipating for me - at least for about a week or so after the dose (I had my doses every 3 weeks).  I took senokat laxative - 3 a day but throughout the day - I found this to be the best way for me to have a bowel movement.  I heard from other taxotere ladies that this worked for them also. Libby, I had to rest and sleep a lot during my taxotere treatment.  Although everyone reacts differently, it is better to be prepared to do what your body needs,  Basically, I slept through my taxotere.  I did light cooking and very little housework.  I often didn't feel like reading so I listened to relaxing music.  I did get through it and now my body is recovering albeit slowly. I hope the taxotere does kill the beastly cancer inside you.  Visualising it killing the cancer cells may work for you. Best wishes.  And do share or ask any questions you need to as the people in this forum are so helpful!",

I had my first Taxotere on Friday and yesterday morning woke up sore all over and it hasn't stopped since then.   I'm also having painful back spasms.  The list of side effects from Taxotere say aching joints so I would say the Taxotere is making me feel so horrible.  I will phone my Key Worker if I don't feel better in another day - I hear from other Ladies that their aches went away shortly after they started. I haven't had a period since my 1st chemo in May and I'm having hot flashes and night sweats so perhaps the aches and pains are increased because of the chemo-induced menopause. This is all very hard to take and I know you Ladies have said how hard it is for you - being active previously and now feeling so miserable.  I also am self-employed so have not had an income since February - I hope I can go back to work soon after chemo ends in September.  I want to go back to my walking and gardening and active life! My body feels like it wants to give up but I have so much more I want to do.  But I do wonder how my quality of life will affect my ambitions.  Do any of you feel a bit hopeless some days and just wish this was all over (and I'm not suicidal).

I also check my blood tests on the internet but my chemo nurses have told me \"don't read into it\".   I have had my liver function tests done over and they have always returned to normal.  I hope that yours also return to normal. It seems to me that there is a fine line we tread between looking after ourselves and ensuring that anything we \"get\" is caught early and investigated AND between feeling like we want to struggle in the choppy waters of constant panic and anxiety.  By the way, I take anti-anxiety meds.  I'm currently on Cymbalta but will change to Effexor once I'm ready to start Taxoxifen. My partner and my friends help me with the worry - they know I make myself suffer with too much worry so they check up on me and distract me from self-destruction.  I spend time relaxing each day.  Instead of starting the days with news reports I listen to relaxing music.  If something worrying happens, I plan how much I want to give to the worry and then put it out of my mind.  I make the \"worry\" time as constructive as possible not just dwelling on what could happen but doing something about it.  For instance, making an appointment with my oncologist to discuss my fears rather than reading things on the internet that may or may not be true. My belief is that taking care of my worry and being as positive as I can be and enjoying my life can only help me live longer and happier.  This works for me. Sorry, I wrote so much.  I don't know if I helped you at all, but I do hope that you can enjoy your time away from worrying and I really hope that your liver functions tests return to normal next testing!  xx",
