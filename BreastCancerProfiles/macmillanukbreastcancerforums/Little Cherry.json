      "Content": "Hi there Yes I'm on FEC-T, seems like the same then .... after the first Docetexal caught an infection which lead to the sepsis. I was admitted for 4 days with IV antibotics but his time I have had a reduced dose of 75% and apart from being exhausted and achy seems to be abit better. Apart from very emotional getting there slowly. Is it normal to cry at anything!!! Thanks for your response xx",

The first 3 rounds were manageable but when I had the first round of Docetexal ended up with sepsis. Everyone is different I know ..had the 5th dose Monday just gone which was a reduced dose of 75 % and been exhausted and a few aches and pains but so far so good. Been an emotional wreck today though.... thank God my k husband and kids love me as I have been a horror! Keep me updated on you,  sending hugs x",
