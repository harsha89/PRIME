    "Content": "I have lymphodema in my arm and mostly wear a sleeve and and glove - but in this weather .... My skin's incredibly dry and straches so very easily - and then my arm leaks for days (literally) - it's not like a cut that clots and stops bleeding - and I end up with lympho goo running down my arm.  Does anyone else experience this?  Any ideas how you can stop it - it's useless wearing plasters they just fill up and the goo squirts out!.  Look and feel really freaky when this happens!  Keep smiling everyone XX",
