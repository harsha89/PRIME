    "Content": "Hi, I was diagnosed May 2011 with TNBC 3cm lump, lymphnode involvement. Had chemo first (4xEC, 4xTax), lumpectomy &node clearance and 35rads. One year after diagnosis they discovered a lymphnode in an unusual area ( inside my arm muscle), it was removed, no further treatment. I had a PET CT scan and everywhere was clear. Post op & post rads I had Seroma fluid collections which gave me discomfort and they were removed. After a while though discomfort was put down to damages due to rads and I should get on with it. The doctors tactile check for lumps didn't find anything of concern. I have a yearly full checkup with chest xray, ultrasound, mammogram, liverscan and at 2 years (May'13) it came back all clean. I had a discomfort around the sternum/ rib area behind the affected breast for a while, not pain, just another rads induced discomfort, which supposedly could be around for years. 2 weeks ago I insisted on an ultrasound and they found an enlarged lymphnode hiding behind the breast muscle, near the arm pit, not the sternum! A recurrence. However - the PET CT scan revealed that there is a second tumour/enlarged lymphnode behind the ribs- near the sternum! It's in the 'internal mammary lymphnode' and its about 3cm ( not confirmed yet). I have not heard of anyone having affected lymphnodes in the ribcage?!! None of the traditional checks would have found it, if the doc hadnt ordered a pet scan due to the cancer node they found on the side - that worries me immensely. Beside the emotional distress of how long has t been sitting in my body - how are they going to get it out??? There is talk about a cyber knife or cutting through rib bones. Has anyone had either?? What can I expect? Rexi xx",
