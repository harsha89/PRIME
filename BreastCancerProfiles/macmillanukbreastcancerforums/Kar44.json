      "Content": "I was told there was only a 1% benefit of chemo in my case but I still chose to have it. I had 6 cycles of fec and finished in May. I was young (39) so I wanted any treatment available and knew If the cancer came back I'd always wonder if I could of changed it by having chemo. I don't regret my decision but I do wonder if I did it for nothing.",

      "Content": "Thanks for your reply, I'm a year on from diagnosis of Papillary breast cancer, grade 2, er 7, pr 4, her2 negative. Yes I believe the US now uses hormone status, grade and oncotype results if available as well as the TNM grading system as this gives a more accurate stage of breast cancer. If the UK follows suit I would go from stage 11b to stage 1a which would be great. I've really struggled to find much info on Papillary breast cancer as it isn't that common.",

      "Content": "Yes I've read that page, I think I've probably read every article written about papillary breast cancer so far . My oncologist said chemo would be of very little benefit to me, just 1% but I decided I wanted to have it anyway so I didn't have the oncotype test, I work in Radiology and deal with people with sge 4 cancer everyday so needed to know I've done all I could. I'm on tamoxifen and so far no side effects.",

      "Content": "Hi,     I've just been reading an article about new guidelines for staging Breast cancer, the new staging system uses info such ER status etc as well as tumor size and node involvement.  I'm not sure if these guidelines are only being used in America at the moment but I'd be interested to find out more as this new system means I would be stage 1 instead of 2. Does anyone have any info on this?",
