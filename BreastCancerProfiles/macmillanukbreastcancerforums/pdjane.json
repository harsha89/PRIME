    "Content": "I remember those feelings very well. NO you are not going mad and you dont sound mad either. The brain has an amzing, but annoying way of turning to mush when you have questions needing answered. I used to have really good conversations with myself, and get some good answers too :) So, all I will say and it is up to you ultimately, please share with your husband and son. They will want to be with you to support you. If they are involved at this stage, where you have not yet received a diagnosis (and it may well be a benign cyst or something), they can support you fully. Sounds like you are in a loving and close family relationship.. share what you are going through. They might be worried too because, they will notice you looking worried right now.  Good luck with the mammogram and scan... ask questions.. dont go home thinking I wish I had asked such and such.... ask ask ask!  Also, if they give you information at the clinic that you dont understand or dont hear properly (words can be misinterpreted) tell them you dont understand.. write stuff down.  For you, I wish you a happy life without fear and worry. As I said before, good luck with the appointment. Chin up . Sent with love x",
