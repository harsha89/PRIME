      "Content": "Hi all, I had full node clearance op on Thursday past (20th) and now await appointment to see oncologist to discuss my chemo. Can you please advise me what questions to ask at my appointment as i don't have a clue!!!!! Having to have my op was such a shock as i was diagnosed with breast cancer on 2nd Sept, Mastectomy 16th Oct and my consultant was so sure that it hadn't spread. Unfortunately the 5 nodes she removed for testing during my mastectomy surgery all tested positive. The thought of chemo is terrifying me and i want to have as much information as possible. Thank you so much in advance. Avie",

      "Content": "Was at hospital today to receive results from my lymph node removal surgery. 21 lymph nodes removed during surgery - 21 lymph nodes tested positive. Liver Scan clear & Bone scan clear. Relieved about those results. HER2 Positive. Staging given as T3 N1 M0. Grading given as grade 2. Chemo & Herceptin to start early January. Understood most of what she said but could anyone please explain things in terms that someone with \"a head like cotton wool\" right now will understand. I just seem to go a bit \" la la\" at hospital and don't take everything in. Thank You Avie xx",
