      "Content": "Hiya,    My treatment did not include chemo, but my tutor suggested wearing a swimming cap - avoids goggles getting knotted up, so I am the only one in the pool with a speedo cap on - just an idea but wud avoid being embarrassed . Re : Jelly , again I do not have a prosthesis , however my 3 lots of surgery has resulted in a very misshaPped boob with no nipple, I was very very embarrassed but sooo fed up with myself I had to overcome it somehow. I bought a tankini , which looks like a sports top with shorts and always enter the pool with my towel drapped over my shoulder. see my profile pic. The pool I swim in , is 1.5 metrs so only my head sits above the water. Hope that helps  Beevergirlxx progressing to Dolphin woman ha ha xxxx",

Anyhow what do know is we all have good days and not so good days , so am appealing to humour here in the hope that I cause laughs for all irrespective of where they are  ie. on a good day or not so good day.  HHere goes, eventually pluck up courage to enlist on the said BC group, fumble with chat room , blog or whatever the technology is called. sort of get to grips with it , then comes the signature name , ummm oh dear my memory is not what it used to be so plump for a nick name an old colleague gave me , my surnames Beever and I was way back then young although we still meet for a brew now and he still calls me it, Beevergirl. .....then pick up courage to share with my hubby , daughter and close friend that have made a positive move forward. When tell them my signature name they roll about laughing. is the joke on me ha ha. Hope it has raised some laughs my mac friends . I am in a want to be alone mood so have a caring boss who has let me work from home today with it being a sensitive day. lots of hugs, reassurances we will all get through and love Beevergirlxx",

Joint pain in ankles went after a year. Joint pain in hands still trouble some. Hot flushes were terrible but my be nurse suggested a lady are magnet !! Boots sell it around £25 .some ladies it works for some it doesn't - for me .... Significant improvement. Whilst having lip filling as reconstruction mentioned to a young lady who was in too - her mum suffered hot flushes - she emailed me later - instant success . It's worth the £25 to try. 4 years on and still on treatment I have moments when I'm going to pack it in .... But then I stick it out. Good luck I hope it works for you too Beever girl xx",
