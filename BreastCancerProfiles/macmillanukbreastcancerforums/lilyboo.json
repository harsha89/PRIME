      "Content": "I was 25 at my diagnosis, started my treatment 2 weeks after. It is aggressive type and your team should be on top of it! Thankfully, mine diagnosed me correctly from beginning and so far I follow recommended treatment path for it so all good.  Sadly, ibc cannot be diagnosed earlier that stage 3b so it\u2019s normally in your lymph nodes too that\u2019s my stage at the moment too. I still have two more chemos to go, saw the surgeon this week and operation is booked 4 weeks after.  Once you will see your oncologist write some questions down and bring someone with you! It is going to be ok just breathe! ",

Hormones (er), protein her2 or triple negative? Make sure they start chemo as soon as possible as it\u2019s crucial to move fast now! Is it in your lymph nodes too? ",

Mine got really itchy and it was sort of rash as well and due to my age thought it\u2019s a bra but sadly it never went away. I\u2019m going to think of you! And pray it\u2019s nothing serious! Please let me know after your appointment! At least you are ready and there are loads of treatment options! But make sure you bring someone to your appointment because if it\u2019s good news you can go for lunch but if not you\u2019ll have a support! My partner had to rush from work! As I didn\u2019t bring anyone because I just didn\u2019t expect those news hehe xxx",

I personally don\u2019t even have a lump. But it\u2019s common 70 percent of cases there is no lump present. I wish you best of luck in your appointment, if it is that I\u2019ll post some articles about standard of care so you would be familiar too and could keep an eye on your medical team",

Treatment isn\u2019t as bad I\u2019ve been silly and went off sick as I\u2019ve listened to my partner, doctors and work I wish I\u2019ve never done that now!  Ct or mri plus nuclear bone scan is standard so don\u2019t get too worried too! sending you my hugs and thinking of you!
