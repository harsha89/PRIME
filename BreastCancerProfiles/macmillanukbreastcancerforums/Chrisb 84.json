      "Content": "Hi  Just looking for advise or reassurances as I'm really worried about my girlfriend  Last friday 6th Jan she had a painful left breast that was sore to even touch,  over that weekend it became more painful and redness around the skin of the nipple area and she found a lump and she thinks possible swelling ( at the time she was on her period) On Monday we visited the nurse at the drs who said it was mastitis and gave her antibiotics and told her to come back at the end of the month unless her symptoms got worse (she is not breastfeeding)  Since Monday and been on the antibiotics the pain has gone completely, redness has reduced to almost nothing, but the lump has remained Which you can feel/see more when she lies down rather than standing up. The lump feels around a quarter of an inch wide and above the nipple. She is not sure if the lump has reduced in size or not. And me been to scared of hurting her didn't check at the start so can't tell As some of the symptoms have reduced with the antibiotics should we wait until the planned dr appointment or go back sooner? Thank you for any advise in advance  Chris",

      "Content": "Hi Julia Thank you for your reply, Like most GP's she couldn't get an appointment last week only to keep calling in the hope of a cancellation. so after a triage call they suggested an appointment with the nurse practitioner. I didn't see the examination but was at the appointment my partner tells me she checked both breast and checked under her arms as well as looking and asking question about the symptoms and how long she had them for. Thank you again  Chris.",
