      "Content": "Hello grandmap. . I'm 9 down with 6 to go. Slapping on moisturiser - from the chemist as the hosp didn't supply anything - twice daily and doing the physio exercises twice daily too. Boob a bit sore and looking mottled and slighter browner. Tiredness hit me like a sledgehammer yesterday! 10 hours sleep not enough and takes me all morning to get myself together. Fortunately got late afternoon appts. Roll on Saturday when it's all done. Good luck . L",

I'm a c cup and they're fine for me. Get them in black and then the ink markings don't show on your whites!!",
