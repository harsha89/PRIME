      "Content": "Hi I had my DIEP flap reconstruction two weeks ago.  Although it was a bigger surgery than the mastectomy , so far its been ok.  You will spend longer in hospital and you feel a little uncomfortable for a while after but I'm now fine with the odd paracetamol..  The actual reconstruction I have had done looks amazing so far!!   Hope this helps but if you want to know anything else let me know.   Maria x",

      "Content": "Hi   I had 4 drains in post op, - 2 in my tummy and two in my new breast.  You also have a catheter for the first couple of days, which means you don't really notice the drains at first.  I had 3 drains and the catheter taken out after a couple of days, and the last one in tummy taken out a day or two later.  Whilst in hospital it was quite bent over when I was out of bed, its a bit odd but it certainly helps, just picture yourself as an old woman.  You also need to sleep with pillows under your knees and you can't sleep on your back.  I have been using lots of pillows to support me and have actually got used to sleeping in that position.  The biggest thing to remember is, if you want to move ie get out of bed, you have to pull your knees up first - then its not too bad.  I live in Northampton but went to Stoke Manderville for my op as they have an amazing surgeon there. The surgery takes quite a while (6-8 hours) but you're asleep so of course you don't notice.  Its 2 weeks today since my op. I can move about pretty much standing straight, no pillows under my knees any more, you can't bend down or reach up easily but its not a problem, not really any pain,- my arm aches a bit but easing up, I have excercises to do for it.  You will get tired easily and you have to move about slower than usual. Much better at this stage than I thought I would be so fingers crossed it will keep going the same way. I see my consultant this week. Good luck   Maria",

Hope this helps Maria x",

Best wishes to you all   Maria xx",

Any views would be great.   Regards Maria xx",
