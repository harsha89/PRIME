      "Content": "Went for results of CAT scan today with regard to starting treatment. CAT scan was clear of further cancer although I have a problem with remaining ovary which will have to be removed at a later date. I am down for surgery on Tuesday where my lymph odes will be removed along with some muscle due to amount of lymph nodes involved.  Surgeon said he would try move lump in breast by Lumpectomy but I may need further surgery which will be discussed if necessary. I was supposed to have chemo first but chose surgery so will I still need chemo if theyve removed the lump ad nodes or if I have to have masectomy. Does everybody ave chemo",

      "Content": "ten years ago my sister was diagnosed with breast cancer and had masectomy...and akthoughmum died 6 months after she was diagnosed she could tell mum. Two years ago I had iffy scan but Dad was in hospital up north and dying. I spent the results waiting time trying to figre out how I would tell him and releived it tred out to be fatty tissue. Now the first thing I felt when I was diagnosed in January was that I missed Mum. Now I miss dad as well..as we could laugh at stupid things. This thing gets in your head and no matter how much you push it down and get on with life it will keep bobbing its head above the water.  It has taken over..I cant go to work....my friends all work..I havent a big social group..moved too many times for that...I just want somebody to realise I need a hug  even when I dont think I do. I know there are drop in centres but arranging transport for appointments is hard enough. I am waiting for the cafe in the village to be opened jst for somewhere to go in day . You arent stupid and the treatment wasnt as bad as I thought..had first chemo last week. Its gonna be a hard slog but you can do it.",

      "Content": "Hi Kate I had CT scan as well and showed something on my remaining ovary. Ive been told nothing to worry about as its slow growing cyst on my remaining ovary ( I had one one my other ovary that grew quite quickly) . I didnt have masectomy but 10 lymph nodes were infected which was more than thougt and lump in breast had grown about 1cm in a month but they managed to clear that without having to have a masectomy.  I have been told to arrange another scan between 6-12 months with GP. I am hoping that it doesnt grow as quick as the other one, I wish you well but its worrying all the waiting",

NO problems just the smell..is it the chemo going through..mainly drinking  saprkling water or flavoured water as I find it better tan plain water.

Today is much the same. Not sleeping deeply as pain from wle and carding makes it uncomfortable. I thought as days passed it got easier but mine seems to be getting worse. I am used to pacing with ME but this is so different that I am barely functioning. Does your body get used to chemo or does this happen after every session.",

I rely on friends to give me lifts to hospital as I cannot walk from house to train station or from train station to hospital.

I was admitted a couple of weeks ago and it cost my husband nearly £18 in parking. I spoke to macmillan financial help and they agreed that it was unlikely that I would get PIP. You have to have illness for at least 3 months and treatment must be continuing for 9 months. Thats why breast cancer doesnt count.

Wig dept rang up today to make appointment....postponed it for a week as they wanted it week after 1st chemo session. I am struggling at minute with exhaustion from ME but thats mainly from effort it takes with hospital appointments.   I am very nervous although people who talk to me say I am taking it well and am very strong person ( that must be person behind me). Husband beleives it will make me a bit tired and I should be able to cope as Im used to it with ME ( usually spend one day at weekend in bed during working weeks) and I still look well.  Is anybody else starting in next two weeks",

      "Content": "HI I had lumpectomy and nodes removed at beginning of February. I had 10 of 29 nodes infected which was considered high. I chose to have operation first before chemo because of other health issues. Next week I have my third chemo.  First time you go to chemo the take weight, bloods, height etc and then everything was explained to me as to why I needed chemo and side effects I might get. Must admit first chemo was scary more than anything but side effects were bearable just ( though first thing I went off was tea). Second chemo was not good experience and side effects are more noticeable. Exhaustion is hard work ( and I have ME so am used to exhaustion). Also make sure you have some sort of social life....I find the isolation hard work as my friends are work colleagues and I cant just hop on bus ..also I have give up driving because of the effects chemo is having on my ME. Everybody says you will get through it and you do but just occasionally during treatment you do wonder if you have strength. I am lucky as I have friend who goes with me to every appointment...she knows my ME and gives support when I find it difficult to explain..she also acts as reminder as I dont always pick up what doctors are saying. The one thing I did find helpful ( I am light/touch sensitive on bad days) was to take sunglasses with me to the chemo department as I found the full on flourescent lights extremely tiring. I hope everything goes well for you. By the way I still have the pencil line from my op but at least the arrows have gone.",

Oxygen levels kept dropping. Back yesterday with drain in which district nurse was going to deal with today. At about 7.30 noticed top was wet. Couldnt get hold of anybody so rang A & E whos aid to speak to GP..when finally got hold of GP they said they couldnt do anything bt gave me district nurses number..chnaged top again twice. District nurse cam drain was still in place but not going into bottle. In end she spoke to hospital and they said to come straight up.  Drainage had doubled over night with measurment in bottle let alone outside. Drain had apparently slighty come out so bottle had no vacuum..couldnt get dtain in again so now have to go back on Monday for drain by syringe unless I have problem over weekend in which case go straight to A & E. I am tired and very weepy. Cant fid anywhere to put arm in comfort. Shoulder is number but itchy which is a weird feeling altogether. Just generally fed up now.",
