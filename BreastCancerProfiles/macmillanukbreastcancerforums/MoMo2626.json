If the consultant can\u2019t put your mind at rest that taking it doesn\u2019t increase your risk of other cancers by the same factor as the protection that it offers then I would stop taking it. It\u2019s not a choice for me as the percentage of protection for me is much higher. In honesty if it only gave me a 2% improvement in the chance of preventing a recurrence I probably wouldn\u2019t keep up with taking it as for me getting rid of the hot flushes would be worth the increased risk.",

Did anyone else?  Thankfully also only got single bone marrow boosting injections not the daily ones she had such a bad reaction to as well.  Did wonder why my nose ran all the time through chemo, never occurred to me till I read this that it was because my nose hair had fallen out.   Really highlights all the things that doctors/nurses don't tell you though, in that regard her experience is the same as mine.  Particularly gynecological changes which did make me really angry at the time.  Felt like the attitude was 'you should be grateful to be alive, you cant expect a sex life as well'.  Hope she goes back to work as she would be a fantastic breast surgeon now.      ",

Also tried Sylk & Yes Yes but they are both water based and disappear almost straight away.  Might not be as hypoallergenic (though it is perfume free) but I prefer silicone based ID Velvet.  It leaves your skin lovely and soft as well and doesn't disappear.  I did struggle with pain when trying to have sex after chemotherapy.  I found pelvic floor exercises and dilators helped.  You can either get dilators on prescription or if you want to save yourself the embarrassment they are also available online from places like Amazon.  Its the one thing no doctor or nurse will bring up unless you do first yet its one of the most distressing side effects of cancer treatment.     ",

If you aren\u2019t \u2018cold capping\u2019 I would plan on being there an hour though from memory it was a bit less than that. If you are \u2018cold capping\u2019 then it will be quite a lot longer but I didn\u2019t do it (unfortunately) so I couldn\u2019t say how long it would take.
