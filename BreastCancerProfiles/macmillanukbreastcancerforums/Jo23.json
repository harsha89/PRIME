      "Content": "Hi all So I ended 2014 finishing treatment, had chemo, lumpectomy and then rads. I was so happy and relieved to be starting a new year free from all that breast cancer treatment, thought I could get my life back! Only 3 days ago I noticed pain and discomfort in my neck. After googling I realised it was my thyroid I could feel not a strange lump. No idea if I could feel this before it started hurting or not. Went to see GP who agreed that she could feel thyroid and is arranging a blood test and ultra sound. So I'm back to feeling terrified again waiting for tests to be done again to see what it is. Anyone else had problems with swollen thyroid after radio? Doctor did say that the proximity of radio and thyroid may have caused some discomfort but she didn't really know. I'm 38 with triple negative cancer, not sure I can handle being this scared every time I have some new symptom and fearing the cancer has returned.  Jo  ",

I have been thinking about looking into some kind of relaxation/ meditation to help me learn how to cope with my fears, I know That anyone who has come through this awful disease is fearful of what's to come and we all have to learn to deal with that fear and enjoy life. ",

      "Content": "I had 18 lymph nodes removed under my right arm, surgeon took them all because if he hadn't and there was still some cancer cells I'd b back to square one, so I was happy with that. I was given a good leaflet from my breast care nurse which had the pictures of the exercises to do after op. I made sure that as soon as the drain was removed that I tried to do the exercises 3 times a day. It was extremely painful at first and I couldn't do them well but each day it got easier and I have full movement in my arm. Yes it is numb underneath from the nerve being cut and it does feel strange and yes I'm very careful to try and avoid lymphadema but if it means all the cancer was removed it was worth it.  Jo",
