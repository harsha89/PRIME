      "Content": "Hi jjtoo, I haven't had the same problem as you, but share your frustration. We are constantly told that the earlier we detect cancer the higher the chance of survival. I had no lumps or other symptoms but a mammogram showed micro calcifications which indicate a biopsy. The biopsy showed cellular changes called atypical lobular hyperplasia - something I had never heard about. Despite being reassured that this condition is benign, my research showed a clear possibility of progression to Lobular Carcinoma In Situ, followed by invasive BC. Was your original cyst biopsied? I am still in consultation with the hospital about my options. I'm 58 and was told an annual mammogram was the standard procedure. However calcifications don't always show up on a mammogram and cellular changes certainly don't. So I feel like I have a potential problem that can only be dealt with when it gets to a visible stage on a mammogram, by which time who knows what the implications will be. I'm hoping to get an excision biopsy which should give a much clearer pathology picture and if necessary I am more than happy to join my sister who had a double mastectomy last year (but only ONE relative with BC so genetic testing not standard procedure). I can only advise to follow your instincts, challenge any current trends and stay optimistic. Best wishes xx  ",

I know the internet can cause unnecessary anxiety but by carefully comparing research and opinions a sensible person can work out what the current consensus and risks are. I tentatively asked about anastrozole (used as chemoprevention) but was told it was only for people who had had breast cancer. It sounds a very effective drug, albeit with some side effects, hope they aren't too bad for you. Best wishes xx",

      "Content": "After a routine mammogram I was recalled because of small calcifications in one breast. I had further mammograms and a vacuum assisted biopsy. I have now been told I have Atypical Lobular Hyperplasia, which the doctor says is not cancer, not pre cancer and nothing to worry about. I am in my late 50s and will now get annual mammograms instead of every 3 years 'as a precaution'. Being of an inquisitive nature I have done some research of my own and find this abnormality often referred to as a pre cancerous condition. A very small change would lead to LCIS. Different people seem to be offered different options. On the grand scale of things I know this is a minor issue but nevertheless a cause of anxiety and I'd appreciate anyone with experience of this condition to share their knowledge. Thanks.",
