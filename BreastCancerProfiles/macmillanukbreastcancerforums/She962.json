    "Content": "I used the cold cap for my 6 cycles of chemo and am glad I persevered despite the discomfort.  My hair did thin  - I lost quite a lot of hair a couple of days before my 2nd round of chemo which was upsetting - and I had a bald patch above my left ear where I suspect the cap hadn't been on tightly enough, but on the whole my hair looked respectable throughout my treatment and I didn't need to use my wig at all.  The biggest benefit was after my chemo finished - as soon as my new hair started growing in my hair looked much thicker.  Unfortunately my new hair grew in very grey and curly but after 6 months I was allowed to get it coloured and now, 6 and a half months after finishing my chemo, my hair looks great, albeit with a little help from straightening shampoo and GHDs! I should add that I followed all the rules - used the recommended shampoo/conditioner, only washed my hair every 5 days or so, slept on a silk pillow case, etc.  It was very uncomfortable having the cold cap on and on a couple of occasions I did let myself get too cold so make sure you keep drinking hot drinks and wrap up well during the treatment.      ",
