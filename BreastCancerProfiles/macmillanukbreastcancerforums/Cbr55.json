I did have to have an injection last week to help boost me and i know i'll have to go back the day after chemo to have another one. My hair has all but gone now and i do think it i started when i was having problems with the white blood count that is when my hair started falling out, I must admit and i know this might sound odd, But it does fascinate me how many different side effects there are and how the body fights this, Hmm i know it's sounds odd but the body is a law unto it's self don't you think? Hope everyone is doing ok? Dee.",

I don't see my doctor untill 15th and don't like to pester the nurses. My treatment is Cycophosphsmide and Taxotere (Docetaxel) Just thought i'd ask on here and see if anyone is having the same problem. Dee",

      "Content": "Hello Penny, Thanks for getting in touch, You sound like me at school as i was always larking about(haven't changed really lol.) What web sites do you look at on Google? I know some people would find this worrying or even a little disturbing but i'm fascinated by the body and how it' works i even watched a programme called Autopys on the TV performed by an a German Doctor- Dr Gunther Van Hagens. Then when me and my husband were on a weekend break in Amsterdam he had an exhibition there and my hubby said \"oh god, you'll want to go to that?\" yip lol.. Again it was fascinating, I do tend to think that this is a journey i'm taking one i never thought i would, so while i have the chance i want to look at it from lots of different ways.Odd! but just like me really lol.. Yes i do pay for perscriptions but the Doc did give me a large bottle and like i said it only lasted for three days so i've got off lightly so far ha ha. I know what your saying about stress but i don't tent to stress about stuff(chemo i mean) As long as they explain everything what there doing and why and what i don't know i'll look up. At one point my hubby was worrying about me looking on the internet and yes you can frighten yourself, But i am too inquisitive and when it's about me i'm like a sponge i need to know if that makes sense? I'm not bothered if my hair falls out, it'll grow back and whats a few months. I hope you don't mind me mentioning but i did read your profile and saw that yours is terminal, Sorry to hear that. You know it gets my back up at times when i'm talking to friends and they say how brave i'm being, I don't think like that, It's people like you who are the brave ones, Sorry if i've stepped out of place i hope your all right with that. it's been nice chatting and i hope my rantting about the body hasn't frightened you off, I'm only a little odd lol.. Best wishes. Dee",

My question is this, even though i'm told i will have a mammograme on the remaining breast does anyone know if they ever check the scar where the mastectomy was done? even though the breast isn't there, The reason why i ask is because i sometimes have pain in the scar area and was a little concerned as i also had part of the rib and lung treated during radio as the tumour was growing inward and i also seem to be getting the cough which i had before my breast cancer back, should i ask about this or a i being paranoid?

After my mastectomy in 2008/9 Chemo, radiotherapy followed by Tamoxifen and Letrozol no reconstruction(it's not for me and I'm happy with that.) However about a year after I finished all my treatment apart from medication I returned to work and after a few hiccups with  double pneumonia  broken ribs I was fine until one day I checked my (R) side where I had the mastectomy.where the site of  the tumour is I noticed a small lump about the size of a pea which I have kept my eye on, well. on and off until this week the small size lump is the size of a penny so now I'm not sure what to do, do I visit the GP?  or am I being paranoid :-(   I've also noticed pain going through my chest to my back and yes I cough but I do have asthma, I seem to put everything down to my age all the aches and pains of getting older I have just turned 62yrs old.  I worry because the last time I had an appointment at the hospital (and I'm not sure if this is just me) the kindness and help you receive when you are diagnosed seemed to have disappeared the nurses looking at each other passing glances then being left until your turn was missed then pushed through quickly, I honestly felt like getting up and walking out and I think this is what is putting me off. ",
