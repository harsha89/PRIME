      "Content": "Hi nannymary  It was lovely to read about someone who has come through this experience with such a positive outcome. As someone who's now embarking on the treatment part, my main worry has always been that I'd come out totally wrecked mentally and physically. I'm not deluding myself as to what could happen after reading through so many people's experiences, but your experience is also an inspiration. Good luck for the future and thanks for coming back to share this milestone with the community, hugs xx",

Decided not to go for it on nurse's advice re infection and because the miracle nurse managed to get the cannula in on the second go, but we are leaving the option on the table. If I could pick your brains on how quickly side effects can manifest. I've been loaded with anti sickness pills and stuff for constipation,but was wondering about breathlessness. I've suffered from asthma in the past so I'm worried about recognising the difference. Any advice would be most welcome. Sending virtual hugs and luck to everyone xx B",

I'm a rather anal person and like bullet points so bear with me. 1. PICC line. I have and have always had rubbish veins, been the bane of my life, and I'm wondering if I should just request this right at the start. 2. I am having 6 sessions of FEC(sorry a bit of levity,always feel like I'm swearing when I say that), is anyone got experience of this without T, and any ideas about dealing with side effects. 3. I want to give myself the best advantage and load up on vitamins but not sure which ones are best. With my genetic history, bones and blood issues are bound to rear their heads so any advice would be gratefully accepted. In the meantime keep fighting the good fight, you're all an inspiration to us newbies. B P.s too lazy to go through all my history, got it all written up in my profile if interested.",

My crap veins means a simple blood test takes at least two attempts and don't get me started on finding a vein for my op after fasting day before. Let's just say pin cushion is an understatement. 3. Cranberry tables are a great suggestion, I'll add it to my list.   Thanks again for the advice and good luck with everything. B",
