    "Content": "Hi all,  I was diagnosed with breast cancer hormone positive,  stage 1 grade 2. I have the operation scheduled for tuesday and my son has been giving me broccoli and cabbage smoothie shots. He has been searching the internet regarding foods to eat/and not to eat and if im not already anxious and scared enough the conflicting stories and information on food is scaring me and him so much.  Firstly flaxseeds - do or dont? I am so confused Nd dont know what to do... online saying it cAn help but also saying it cAn be bad Secondly eostrogen high foods- what to do? Everything online contradicts each other e.g. one site telling me not to have soy and others saying it is good. Thirdly, diary, how serious is completley cutting diary as I have tried in the past but found it difficult  Also what sort of meals and foods do you recommend during this time around surgery/recovery/radiation.. (i am a vegetarian)  Thanks, right now food and what to eat what not to eat seems to be stressting me out but also if anyone can give Any advice or what to expect in the coming weeks... thanks",
