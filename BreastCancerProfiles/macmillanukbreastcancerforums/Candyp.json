    "Content": "Hi, I had my first treatment, same as you on Monday just gone. My side effects have been, off my food, feeling sick, sleeping a lot and dipping my toes into feeling sorry for myself.  I was not really sure what to expect, even though I read up on almost all that I could. I am having scalp cooling treatment in the hope that I won't lose my hair, but that in itself I find quite stressful. Just know that if I can get the sickness under control I will manage better. I send you my love and best wishes and hope that this is one experience both you and I and everyone else will not have to encounter again.  Keep fingers crossed for all.",
