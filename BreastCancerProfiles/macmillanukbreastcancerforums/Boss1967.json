    "Content": "hi , my next door neighbour had her head shaved last year I was quite shocked as she had hair half way down her back and this was before I got diagnosed with kidney cancer , then a week or too later I got taking to her it was then she told me that she donated her hair and it had made 4 wigs 2 for children and 2 adult  wigs for people who had lost their hair through this god dam disease  , I am lucky so far as I am on watch and wait so no nasty pills for me at present not that I would want a wig if it came to it , but those four wigs did a good turn for these 4 people , although it might hit a nerve for some which I can understand but also can help others .",
