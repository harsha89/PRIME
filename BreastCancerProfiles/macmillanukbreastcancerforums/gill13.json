      "Content": "hi looby i've have just been disgnosed too,   i was told yesterday,  but had already been told it wasn't looking good at scan and fine needle biopsy stage. i've been booked in for surgery sept 29th and am having an MRI scan first to see whether lumpectomy can be done or whether i'll need masectomy.  surgery has been delayed due to the mri scan but i was told that the delay would not affect the cancer i'm feeling a bit numb at the moment,  i think maybe i should be weeping and wailing but i'm not?  i even feel a bit of a fraud for having not gone into work today?  and i don't know about you but i'm rarely ill, so can't understand how this can be going on inside you?? xxx  ",

      "Content": "hi dianne i think thats exactly how i feel,  rather not have it, but now need to just deal with it,   (and i don't feel guilty enough about work to check my emails! lol ) i'm just trying to get to grips with all the terminology that is being used,  so you've had the lump removed and they are checking your lymph nodes? and your appointment is to decide on the radiotherapy or whatever treatment is required now?   i'm sorry if that seems blunt,  at the moment i'm just trying to get as much info as poss in a language that i can understand.  i have already been told that my lymph nodes are affected and will be removed,  and depending on MRI results, it will be lumpectomy or masectomy.  hope all goes well this afternoon for you xx",

      "Content": "hi looby, glad to see you feeling more positive, i think once you know what you're dealing with, it does make things easier. it must be hard with being so hard from home. i'm finding that carrying on as normal is helping me. friends who know,  have been asking me how i am, and i keep saying fine,  and work collegues who don't know say hello, how are you?  i say fine, and you? when really i'm thinking i've got breast cancer,  No,  i'm not fine!  i'm worried about looking ill too, i'm worried about loosing my hair,   i'm scared of walking on the playground to pick up my daughter and people looking at me as the mum who has got cancer...everything feels like its on hold",
