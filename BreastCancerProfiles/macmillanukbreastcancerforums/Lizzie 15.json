      "Content": "Hello Everyone I had my operation on the 12th December and now waiting to see oncologist with regard to Radiation treatment.  Need 15 treatments. Have developed a lump just above the operation site on my breast.  About an inch wide and deep.  Doesn't hurt and no inflammation or heat with it.  Unsure if it's just scar tissue or something that would need drained.  Don't want treatment to be delayed as just want to get on with everything now I know I need it.  Just wondered if any of you have experienced something similar? Thanks Liz",

      "Content": "Thanks for replying Hides Will mention it to nurse but will try massaging it to see if it reduces too.  Glad to hear you are getting on ok with Radiotherapy.  Lots of good advice on this site and great support too.  Good luck with the rest of your treatment. Liz ",
