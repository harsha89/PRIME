    "Content": "Hi everyone had my second chemo this morning which is also my 38th birthday :-(  they did offer to postpone but I just want to crack on and get it over and done with.  Hair started to fall out on Monday so my cousin shaved it off on Wednesday and I\u2019m so glad I decided to do it.  Feeling a little bit tired and I can sense the start of a headache so I\u2019m going to go and get in bed shortly.  You are all doing amazing and this group is so helpful xx ",
