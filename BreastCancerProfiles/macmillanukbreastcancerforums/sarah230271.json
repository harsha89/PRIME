    "Content": "Hi everyone my name is Sarah and im 43 yrs old. I was diagnosed with grade 3 breast cancer in july. I found it very sereal and a lot of info to try and take in. I had to have a mastectomy on the 8th aug and removal of lymth nodes on the left hand side. I thought I was taking it all very well and being very pratical about things. I had my first chemo last wed and since then im struggling. Im more tearful and anxious about things. I worry about how Im feeling is this normal or is this side effect not. Im not sure how I should or shouldn't feel emotionally. Is it normal after your first time to feel apprehensive about how physically you are feeling. I try to talk to family etc about how im feeling but I think im just worrying them as they don't know the answers. I think I just need to know im normal and not over worrying. Any advise would be gratefully welcome .",
