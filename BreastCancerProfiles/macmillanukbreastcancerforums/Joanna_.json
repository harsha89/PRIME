    "Content": "  I had very restricted movements after a few days of my op but I also got a large swelling (just fluid) under my arm from the lymph biopsy. The swelling was drained and eventually went down but I was left with a tight arm and a very funny burning feeling all down my arm which I thought was tendon or muscle strain. Turns out it was cording or axillary web syndrome (aws). I was seen by a physio who gave more gentle stretching exercises. It does need checking out as it can lead to lymphedema if untreated/or snapped. ",
