    "Content": "My Mum will be starting preventative chemo in about a months time, she had her left mastectomy two weeks ago. I want to make her up a gift box as a chemo 'rescue kit', you know like you can buy hen-night or hangover rescue kits'. I wanted advice as to what to put in it. I have thought of a few things so far: a very soft toothbrush bonjela (in case she gets ulcers) chocolate ginger to help with nausea cooling facial mist What else would be good and do you think the sort of things I have thought of so far are appropriate? I also want to put fun things in as well, like maybe a special chemo teddy to watch her when I am not there etc. Thank you in advance x x x x",
