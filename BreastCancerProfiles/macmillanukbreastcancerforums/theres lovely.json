    "Content": "I haven't visited this site for a few months as I have been busy \"getting on\" with my chemo. I had 4 FEC treatments which were just about bearable - I seemed to be rough for a weekÂ  before picking back up. Now I am looking for some encouragement!!! 8 days a go I had the first of 4 Docetaxels and it has hit me for six!!! One day, I feel sick, next day I have pains in my legs then sickness returns...thrush in my mouth......I could go on!! Im frightened I will not be able to cope with another 3 doses. Has anyone been really low and came out the other end - I am sure there are many who can inspire people like me! Any tips?? I put a brave face on for a lot of people around me, but quite honestly words can't describe how I feel.",
