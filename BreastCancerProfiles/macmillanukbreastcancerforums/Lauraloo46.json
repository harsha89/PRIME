    "Content": "I have just bought my first bra since surgery because I wanted something with thinner straps. I got a Calvin Klein one from John Lewis, I had asked the lady for post op bras but she just looked at me blankly, I then tried to explain the operation and she wasn't very discreet or understanding so in the end I just asked for a non underwired bra! She brought me the Calvin Klein one which fits great on the new boob as such but not on the other, I probably just bought it to keep her happy but it will do for now!!",
