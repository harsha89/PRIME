    "Content": "I agree with you 100% Dobcross. At the end of the day these people are raising money and awareness. If they feel smug about it - let them, they're doing good. If they don't, then don't worry. I think these days there are so many different ways of raising funds and awareness that not everyone will appreciate them. I think that it is brave shaving your head. They're under no pressure to change the way they look so dramatically but are moved to do so because of their own personal reasons. My sister and I are considering it to raise funds in honour of our Dad. I don't care for one minute if people are annoyed by that - that's what will help us raise a ton of money and will show support for our Dad. He's so proud of us for even considering it and ultimately that's what matters. As Dobcross has so wonderfully said, sticking together counts. Who cares what our motives are x",
