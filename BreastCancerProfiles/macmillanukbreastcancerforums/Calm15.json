      "Content": "Hello Shellb - thank you so much for your reply, it have given me reason to pause and think. It is interesting how we are all so similar and different all at once. When I was diagnosed I was not fearful at all and in the past 6 months I have cried for less time that a TV add break takes. I know that sounds odd but I just accepted that life was taking a detour I had not anticipated. I realised I had no control over the disease but I could control the choice of treatment and surgery I had. I find I am stumbling at this most important decision around surgery...with only days left. It is comforting to hear that you are happy with your new physique via DIEP and that your friend also likes her implants. My frame does not allow for a DIEP....well it does if I just do my left breast and if I am willing to accept being 1/3 of my current size (I am a 30F). I'm happy to be a bit smaller but not 1/3 of the size I currently am. Another lady replied to my post on the Breastgroup board and jolted me with the phrase \"amputate\". Again that gave me reason to pause, for which I am grateful too....her view is why amputate a \"good\" part of my body ie my right breast. I can certainly understand with your diagnosis in L then R and then the gene why you did, in you shoes I would have done exactly the same. From a practical view for my situation I think to myself.....just do it....\"fix both\"....and move on. I am intrigued that I am feeling a sense of loss at the thought of voluntarily choosing to remove my right breast. I notice when I type at the keyboard or I walk on the street the everyday sensation of arms rubbing against the side of my chest hat will be lost. I don't really know what to expect in terms of partial loss of sensation via a lift and reduction on the right versus a \"total\" loss of sensation if I choose a mastectomy on that side too. I would like reasonable symmetry and I know the best way to get that is to do both as mastectomys.....as I type that I feel so vain and I have never felt I was that before. I am not fearful of the surgery....I am fearful of myself and that I will make the \"wrong\" decision and maybe not forgive myself in years to come. Doing a staged approach of Left mastectomy, Right lift and reduction may give me the chance to know what an implant feels like and I can then decided if I want to do an implant on the right at a future date....but then that is another major operation in a year or two. I weigh that with a sense of the unknown of ageing parents and wanting to be best placed to be able to help them should they need me to. As I type I realise I am mixing different \"what if\" scenarios in my head. Anyway, thank you again for your kindness in sharing your experience, it is very much appreciated.",

      "Content": "Hello Mumsplace, Mistymoley, Isingbass, Lorraine7274 and Shellb - I hope you've each had a great week. I just wanted to thank each of you for sharing your experience with me. I have the weekend to make my final decision and value the input you've shared. I too have a pro and con list for the two surgeries I am choosing between - I'll see how that evolves on the weekend. If there are any other learnings around sensation etc I'd be interested. I know with a lift and reduction on the right I'd lose some sensation and possibly all. I thought if I decided instead to have a mastectomy on the right I would lose all sensation but a Macmillan nurse who spoke with me today suggested I may have some sensation. I am assuming none on the nipple (if I'm lucky enough to have nipple sparing) and maybe some from the surface of the skin, depending on how the nerves are cut. Maybe I should make my decision on \"worst case\" ie no sensation at all. Anyway, thank you all again, the strength and caring nature of women individually and collectively is phenomenal. I wish you each happiness and a short road to long term health. Calm15.",

      "Content": "Hello may I ask for the experience of others to help me please? I was diagnosed with breast cancer of left breast, grade 3 invasive ductal carcinoma with an involved lymph node, ER -ve, HER2 +ve, multicentric and multifocal. I have completed my main chemo and am due to have surgery in the coming days. I have been told a mastectomy of my left breast must occur, and I have investigated implants, Diep, TMG and LD solutions. Implants are the only viable option. I am trying to decide between having a mastopexy (lift and reduction) on the right breast, or to have a mastectomy and implant on the right too. I wonder does anyone have personal experience of the change or loss or sensation from a lift and reduction please? I have been told with a mastectomy that all sensation is lost and I am not sure if some or all is lost in a lift and reduction. I am also interest to learn from anyone that chose to have a bilateral mastectomy. When I was told I had cancer my immediate reaction was \"remove both\", but now that I am so close to surgery I am worried that I may regret removing my right breast. I know I could do staged surgery i.e, left mastectomy with right lift and reduction and then at a future date I could then do a right mastectomy, but that feels like I am extending the decision and putting myself through two major operations rather than one major and one minor. I have not had BRCA test and there is no time left before surgery. My immediate female relatives have not had cancer. I will be having radiotherapy. Thank you in advance to anyone who is able to share their experience. I wish you all well.",

      "Content": "Hello Dulcie / Isingbass - thank you for sharing your news. I'd been looking at your other thread earlier too. My surgery is in a couple of days time - how on earth have I not made the decision by now!  I am not scared of the surgery, or the prospect of pain post surgery etc....I am scared I will make the wrong decision. I have to examine am I being a \"perfectionist\" and is that sabotaging my ability to \"feel\" rather than \"logically\" see a decision in front of me. I know I should see it as life threatening, but I don't. That penny has not dropped. I think it because I realise we are all temporary visitors here and some play longer scenes that others, so I am not concerned about it from that perspective, but I recognise most people are and absolutely respect their views and feelings. Please ignore theatre time - that is for the health professionals to resolve for you. I think your focus needs to be on what is right for you. Not whether the op needs to be rescheduled or extra time in surgery etc. We each have to live with our decisions for the rest of our days. I have changed my mind at least 20 times this week, flipping between a) Left mastectomy with implant and right lift and reduction, so I can familiarize myself with the way an implant is on me and also achieve some symmetry, and then in the future potentially have a right mastectomy and implant vs b) Just do a double mastectomy now and move forward. But there is no way to reverse that and stick \"me\" back onto me if I don't like it. I have been told that doing a mastectomy and implant a year or two after a lift and reduction is more complicated due to scar tissue....it is possible but not as easy. So I am weighing up a) potential difficulty of voluntary mastectomy of right being more complicated after lift and reduction of right vs b) the unknown of what a lack of sensation will be like with having a double mastectomy. If only there was a virtual reality programme that I could jump into as a character and \"feel\" the lack of sensation and how I would respond....   Good luck for the 23rd if you proceed.",
