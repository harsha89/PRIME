My first oncologist was dreadful, trying to blind me with faulty science and faulty figures. She clearly didn't like the fact that I had done my own extensive research, and some of what she told me was actually patently untrue. The second one was better, but even so, there was an implied threat behind it when I said that I'd rather have a couple of good years than five rubbish ones, after chemo and on drugs, and she said she wondered if I'd feel that way if it came back. My considered response was that yes, I would, as it goes. As to your oncologist telling you that if it was his wife, he'd advise her to go for it, well - he Would say that, wouldn't he.  Resist emotional blackmail and do what you feel is right for You. My take on it was that it was a smallish tumour - about 15 - 17mm - but as the surgeon decided to take off the entire breast, and all 28 lymph nodes, even though only 5 of them were positive, I figured, whether rightly or wrongly, that any further \"precautionary\" measures were only going to result in compromising my quality of life while I still have one.",

In the face of major opposition from the breast cancer community, Macmillan is once again going ahead with its \"Brave the Shave\" campaign. I still maintain that there is nothing brave about it Brave is running into the sea when you're a poor swimmer, to save a struggling person in trouble. Brave is facing down a gang of drunken yobs picking on your mate. Brave is joining the army knowing that you'll have to cope with dodging a hail of bullets on your first posting.

I didn't have chemo, so no hair loss for me, but I can see what everyone else is saying. People I know who lost their hair through chemo just HATED it. Seeing others doing all this virtue-signalling: \"look at me, aren't I wonderful, going around with a shaven head to raise money for charity\" just made everything SO much worse for those who had to go through the real thing. To all those who wish to help, a message - raise money by all means, but do it by other methods - attract attention to the cause, not to yourselves, and respect the views of those for whom seeing a lot of shaven heads is a very unwelcome reminder of what they had to go through. In 2015, the Brave the Shave advertising campaign raised £4 million. In the same year, Macmillan's \"Campaigning and Awareness\" team's total advertising spend was £25 million. I realise that an organisation like Macmillan cannot rely solely on volunteer labour, and that costs have to be incurred on promotion and awareness, but £25m? I am pretty sure this sort of thing is endemic amongst charities, and I also believe that more thought could be given to the approach. Does Macmillan really need all those full-colour glossy brochures and leaflets? how about \"charity begins at home\" with an austerity drive to cut costs. I was quite pleased with what I managed to raise in 2015 - £100 isn't much in the global scheme of things, but I felt I was at least making a contribution. I'm a good deal less happy now I'm aware of just how much is being piddled away on agency fees. As a former art director I'm very well aware of how much these things cost, and I'm also aware of just how badly they can drain a budget.",

No more gimmicks please, let's concentrate on what is actually of Practical Use. No more \"like and share if you care\" with no backup information, no more daft stuff about \"I am going to be on TV\", I have won the lottery\" etc, so you respond to it and get some sort of \"challenge\" to post something equally daft - half the people who got this and are told to pass it on had no idea it was about breast cancer, and it doesn't actually have a function - it's of no more value than a chain letter. All this gloopy carey sharey \"Awareness\" stuff doesn't help unless people actually DO something, either to help themselves or someone else - it has no practical value. And PLEASE, no more \"Brave the Shave\". The backlash from so many cancer patients on the Macmillan Support site indicate that they find it upsetting, patronising, and too much of a personal wank. \"Look at me, I'm bald now, aren't I BRAVE for doing it, praise me for my fundraising !\" Making yourself look like you've gone through chemotherapy is dreadful to see for those who have actually gone through it. I declined chemo but I know it can be most people's idea of Hell. They hated the way they looked when all their hair, eyebrows and eyelashes fell out, the side effects were appalling, some of them irreversible, and they cringe when they see all the happy smiling faces on Facebook in mid-shave, because hair loss through chemo is nothing to rejoice about, and it's not \"brave\" - anyone can get their head shaved. What's brave is coping with the side effects of the real thing, and coping with the fact that it may not work and you will die anyway. There are Many more ways to raise funds, and it doesn't have to be quite so conspicuous. A good long time ago, when I was still fit enough to do it, I did a 10Km sponsored walk to raise funds for the Sussex Beacon Hospice in Brighton, after one of my best friends in all the world died there of AIDS - but I didn't take a white stick along to look like I had lost my sight from CMV, I didn't starve myself in advance to give me a skeletal appearance, and I didn't take two attendants, one either side, to help me into a chair. The moral of this story is - please don't imitate the appearance of the sick and dying, many of them find it deeply offensive. Rant over.\"",

The donation of hair to charities such as Little Princess is commendable. Well done sjo 1969. Sorry, but I still disagree - it's not just the notion of \"brave\" that is of concern here, it's people on here seeing people with shaven heads as a very unwelcome reminder of what they had to go through - and it will still be splattered all over the media, at massive cost to the advertising budget. We need something new - and we either need the ad agencies to realise they are dealing with a charity, or Macmillan need to row out the Big Boys and allow smaller agencies to pitch. I recall seeing someone on here saying that the major players have it all so sewn up that no new (and probably cheaper) talent ever gets a look-in. In 2015, the Brave the Shave advertising campaign raised £4 million. In the same year, Macmillan's \"Campaigning and Awareness\" team's total spend was £25 million. YES - THAT\u2019S ALMOST HALF A MILLION POUNDS A WEEK IN TOTAL. That's obscene.",

      "Content": "I'm sorry, Michael, because I'm not going to shoot the messenger, but I find the response from the Brave the Shave team to be highly disingenuous. They would only have to read the backlash in this thread to understand the response to this campaign. Speaking to 770 people \"who support cancer charities and who have had a loved one who had been diagnosed with cancer\" is NOT the same as talking to the people like us who actually HAD cancer, and it should be OUR views that count on this one. The fact that this thread is now 22 pages long, with little or no support in evidence for this campaign, speaks volumes to me. If \"more than half of people who signed up last year did so because someone close to them has been affected and they wanted to do something to show their support\", then I have one question to ask, which the Brave the Shave team at Macmillan may find embarrassing. Were all these people offered an alternative method of fundraising? because, by close reading of the entire response, it would seem not. It's a Macmillan initiative - the public didn't dream it up themselves, they are merely invited to participate. I cannot stress more strongly the points that have come across to me in this entire thread. The part about this initiative which seems to be causing the most offence amongst the breast cancer community is the word \"Brave\", q.v. my earlier post above. As someone else has stated, it's a great pity that \"Brave\" rhymes with \"Shave\". It makes a great campaign slogan, but demonstrates an abysmal lack of understanding of the notion of bravery. That word is in there to make the participants feel good about themselves - not to make those who have experienced hair loss from chemo feel good. The participants are well aware that they can be seen to be doing good, which is a massive boost to their self-perception at the expense of the cancer patient. A sponsored knit-in or a fun run wouldn't really have the \"look at me\" factor, would it - they certainly wouldn't be able to call themselves \"brave\". The Brave the Shave team state that it is not their intention to \"in any way compare the two experiences\", but if they believe that this will not actually be the mainstream perception amongst the public, then they are either being extremely naive, or they are dissembling. Oh, and what exactly does the phrase \"as sensitive as possible\" mean? that it doesn't matter if there's a certain degree of collateral damage as long as the main aim is achieved? Finally - we are told that \"Brave the Shave\" participants raised £7.1m last year. Could we please be told the cost of this individual campaign? so that we can see for ourselves to what degree the team felt it was worth offending so many people for the sake of whatever the bottom line turned out to be.",

It's quite likely that Facebook friends of mine will be doing this, and I need a firmly-worded post to pre-empt them in the hope that I can persuade people to fundraise in another manner. Would the contributors to this thread object if I (completely anonymously, and my FB account is not set to 'public') quoted some of the heartfelt comments made here? I promise I won't quote anybody who doesn't contact me with a definite 'yes', but many of you have said it so much better than I can. Thanks in advance XXX It's \"yes\" from me",

      "Content": "Hi Geordiebird - or should that be \u201cwey aye!\u201d ;) xx Carolyn tagged me in your post as she thought maybe I could be useful, so I\u2019ll certainly try :)  Here is a precis of what I\u2019ve posted in other threads about my own experience: I had grade 3 invasive ductal just over a year ago, ER+ weakly positive, tumour 17mm. I had surgery in which they took off the entire right breast plus all 23 lymph nodes (of which 5 were pos and 3 weakly pos). Knowing what they could do to me, I refused all adjuvant therapies - no chemo, no radio, no drugs. It's all about quality of life for me, not quantity. I was 60, and decided I would like to reach 61 without being poisoned. I spoke to two oncologists before coming to the conclusion that adjuvant therapies were not right for me.  The first one was dreadful. I'd done my own extensive research, and prepared a list of questions and it very soon became apparent that she wasn't used to this. She wasn't telling me the truth, which, as far as I was concerned, undermined the entire purpose of the interview. According to her, the figures on the predict tool include radiotherapy (they don't, according to the team that devised it) and I was told that the majority of radiotherapy fatigue is due to the journey to the hospital. Absolute twaddle, I'm afraid - RTh fatigue is so well-documented I'm surprised she thought she'd get away with an assertion like that. As to the question of chemo and Letrozole, the potentially irreversible damage that could be caused (in my case, given underlying health issues) was downplayed to the point of being dismissive.  The second one was better, but even she sought to persuade me by telling me that she wondered if I'd feel the same way about life expectancy if the cancer came back, which frankly, came across as a threat. I was most definitely being steered down a road, and I thought it was iniquitous that one method used was to give me duff information to try and bring it about. A fair bit to do with \"targets\" and \"patient outcomes\" I suspect - keep the box tickers happy - or perhaps I'm just being a jaded old cynic ;) I just had my first annual follow up - no symptoms, no local recurrence, and no abnormalities on left breast mammogram. Given the amount of tissue they had decided to remove as a precaution, I figured there wasn't going to be anything left, and for me, it\u2019s \u201cso far, so good\u201d.",

I had 23 nodes removed, 5 pos and 3 micromets, but that wasn't why they wanted me on Letrozole - it was to do with being ER+. However, at ER3+ which is so weakly positive as to be classed as negative by many, I rejected the idea of even attempting Letrozole as I had trigger finger in both hands a few years back for no associated reason, and in my case the (dubious) benefit would be outweighed by the side effects if I want quality of life. Which I would choose over quantity any day of the week...",

      "Content": "I had full node clearance at the same time as a full right side mastectomy, as I had 5 pos nodes and 3 weakly pos. The drainage tube was a nuisance for a few days but I now only have a small seroma, which has reduced over time (wearing a good bra with deep sides helps to stop you noticing it, eventually I didn't notice it at all). I was already more or less against the idea of chemo/radiotherapy (and eventually, after much research, decided against both), so I figured my best chance was \"having the lot out\" as it were. Take especial care of your arm after the node clearance - treat even the smallest scratch immediately with an antiseptic, and you reduce the chances of lymphoedema dramatically. I currently have a minute amount of lymphoedema, which is not increasing with the passage of time, and all I am doing is massage exercises, no stocking. You will be stiff after the node clearance, and some parts of your upper arm will be numb, but this will not affect movement. What will affect movement is failing to do the exercises they give you. It takes a while, but I have suffered no long-term loss of mobility, and if you develop cording, there are also exercises designed to alleviate it. ",

I was told that if the cancer came back on the right side, no further surgery would be possible in any event, and that if it Did come back in that area I would HAVE to have chemo. OK, so How are they to tell if it Has come back, bar a bit of poking and prodding, in order to put me on chemo - without any other diagnostic tools...?",

      "Content": "Diagnosed with breast cancer August 2015, surgery September 2015. All cancerous material removed by full right mastectomy, together with any affected lymph nodes plus a good few more as a precaution. I examined all the pros and cons of chemo, RTh etc and declined all of it, as I have other underlying conditions which could have been exacerbated to a degree that would have serious effects on my quality of life, whatever is left of it - I'd rather have a few good years than longer life in a compromised state. I have been thinking about one aspect regarding which I am fairly unhappy. I was told that when I get my annual follow-up this year I would be examined physically and have a mammogram on the (thus far) unaffected left breast. And that's it. When I asked if I would be given a further CT scan on the right side, I was told no, \"because of the radiation\". Hang on, guys - you were going to bombard me with radiation across 15 days if I'd gone for RTh, not subject me to one CT scan on one specific area. Am I misguided in thinking their response is unsatisfactory under the circumstances?",
