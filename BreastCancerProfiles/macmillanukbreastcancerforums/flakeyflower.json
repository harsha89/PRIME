Sadly I had bad time kept getting endless infections and spent so much time in hospital, but my friend had the same treatment and sailed through no bother. Try to eat healthily and get your family and friends around to support you. Read all the leaflets they give you and if you have any questions just ask! I wish you well, there is a light at the tunnels end; I have now finished chemo and radio therapy!.",
