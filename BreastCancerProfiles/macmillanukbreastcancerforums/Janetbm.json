      "Content": "Hi Wendy I may try the apples as they still taste all right. I guess I'll just have to either listen to the radio or read for a bit then .. that usually gets me off to sleep. I thought I was beginning to lose my hair earlier than most and did feel that even though I already wear wigs and scarves  felt that others knew about it, silly I know. Hair is supposed to be a woman's crown and glory and the adjustment I could see made my loved ones a little bewildered not knowing what to say when they saw me coming out of the bathroom. However, you've got used to it now. Shopping for new nightwear is a must now that the hot flushes have started. And I will search the website for the any information that will help with hot flushed or whether it is due to chemo induced menopause. Thank you for the detailed the more I find out the better. Lots of Love, Janet ",

      "Content": "Hi Caroline I just wish they would ideally go away for good! I just can not cope with not getting a goods nights sleep leaves me feel grouchy in the morning [laugh]. Yes, I like pineapple but haven't had any for a long time. The water I'm drink which causes me to use the loo a lot at night. And I have already gained a little weight, which I'm finding hard to loose so I'm just going to adjust my diet somehow to keep it down at least. But, as you say it's not so easy with all the meds we have to take. And thank you for adding me as a friend, I have following quite a few of the discussions you've made lately.  ",

I came to the site to hear from other members, find out how they coped and whether they could give me any useful advise as to how to cope with it all. I will check out the downloadable BC books while I'm resting and have the time to do so. Lots of Love   Janet    ",

      "Content": "Hi Wiglady Ok, so it looks like I'll have to take it easy next then. I am drinking more water than I usually drink hence me going to the loo a lot during the night. And as for the hot flushes, I seem to be doing the same [laugh]. My hair I've decided to cut off the top and side patches and continue to wear the wigs I have.  I just hope my symptoms don't get any worse. Thanks for replying x ",
