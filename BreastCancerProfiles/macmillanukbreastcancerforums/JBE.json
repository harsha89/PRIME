      "Content": "Hi Kate I suffered badly with post op fluid.  My surgeon had told me to ring up if I had it at any time, which I did only quiet a few times.  Each time I had it drained off, not painful as give a local injection.  I would not leave it as the build up can increase, ring surgeon or breast nurse for advice.   I tried moving around even though difficult at the time but did not work.  At leasr if nothing else it will ease your mind so go on give them a ring.  Let me know how you get on. Good luck   Best wishes Jan xx",
