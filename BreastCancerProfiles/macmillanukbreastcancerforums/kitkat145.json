      "Content": "Hi I have just had my first round of this yesterday following a lump removal and a portocath insertion. Cycles are every 14 days and i will be having 4 AC and 4 Taxol followed by radiotherapy. Is anyone else currently on this or had it as I can't seem to find anone else on it!!! Any advice great fully received as I have read everything I can about it but it's not the same as actually speaking to someone. I feel fine btw and chemo is not half as bad as its made out from my experience. I am 43. Thanks for reading xx",

Yes I have a thermometer and have been using it every day just to find out what my usual temp it. It seems to be somewhere around 36.5ish . My nurse said paracetamol was better to us and not ibuprofen???? I hope I get a few responses as it seems not many people on that combo. Hope all ok with you and jackie x",

      "Content": "Hi, thanks for all your advice and kind words. I have got the best family and friends to support me I feel so lucky and just seem to be getting on with my life and not letting it take over at the moment. Maybe that changes as my treatments go on but I will do everything I can for it not to. Positivity seems to be a must. Still early days for me and need to work out how to eat 6 smaller meals rather than my nice 3 that I'm used to!! Am hopefully seeing a dietician at my next session of chemo. Work have been brilliant and have said I can work from home and they have set up a computer for me. Not sure how long I will be paid for whilst working from home when I can so an advice with regards on that would be good too! So much to learn and take in!! Hope everyone has a good day x",
