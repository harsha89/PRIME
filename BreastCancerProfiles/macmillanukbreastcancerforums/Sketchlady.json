Try and think positively your having the op Tuesday and the gremlin will be dealt with you'll look back on this in a few weeks and think you was panicking and there is no shame in it hun we all do the same and we want things done like yesterday things will work out ok your just feeling normal things your on a roller coaster at the moment and you have said it yourself you have two young children and you'll fight this for them hun Love Mia xxxxx  ",

      "Content": "Hi Dragonlady I'm very sorry to hear you news you must be in a state of shock!!! I too have grade 3 BC and have had 11 nodes removed 1 was postive and the rest where clear so my Consultant has told me this is really good news as the cancer has not spread it has contained it self to the one breast. I have however had my right breast removed and will be starting chemo any day now for the next 6 months and the 4-6 weeks of radiotheraphy and the five years of tamoxifen and then a different one dependent if I'm still premenopausel Every one is different I'm not so sure if it is due to menopausel I think it is also down to your consultant or the hospital you are under. I know I haven't really helped but but you will deal with it the way you have before even if the news it not what you are expecting trying to be postive as you can be and talking about your fears is a good think. This sight is a wonderful thing you learn so much see what other ppl are going through and as funny as it sounds it really does help. You are not alone I wish you all the best stay as strong as you can be I'm here if you need a chat as are many ohters   Love Mia xxx",

      "Content": "Lol that ok  I don't know they only place a needle in different areas and it depends I had two lumps one of which was 2cm this is why I have to have chemo evidently as there was a gap in between and not knowing what was in between plus the other lump was DCI, basically means pre cancer cells. They inject you so it numbs the area it was a little uncomfortable but every one is different and it depends on the consultant too. But you will have a mammogram and if you have a lump under your arm they'll check this out too I think it is pretty routine and trust me it will be worth it in the end and it makes you more aware even if it is nothing. Good luck 2mrw and try and sleep 2nite if you can    Mia xxx",

Where i live we have a large Breast screening unit this is why I was treated very quickly I expect that all hospitals are different. My left breast (the one I still have is nodular too) but they will still be keeping an close eye on it pardon the pun lol well I hope that you don't have to wait to long    Mia xxx  ",

      "Content": "Hello    I have been reading your post with interest as I had an ache in my arm for over 9 months and see my gp three times as some times it was so bad I couldn't sleep and he repeatedly told me it was because I was a dog walker and held the lead in my right hand. I regually checked my beast or thought I did every six month (told you should check them every month ). I have been seen before by the consultant as I had a cyst 7 hears ago. I had even mentioned the ache to my nurse in August when I had my pill check and she asked if I had any breast lumps I said doubt that I would even know if i'd know what to check for and she just brushed that comment off so due to my  previous experience all that time ago I now know that the lump that I felt was there in early october as I put it down to being on my period and thought it was nothing until my partner notice three weeks later . You are right to demand to have things checked out and even if it is nothing always check your breast every month doesn't matter how old you are  Wish you all the best at your check up    Mia xx",

      "Content": "Hi Coffebean85  I was the same on the pill and my breast where sore and tender sometimes and not others always put it down to being due on, i never actually noticed any misshapes,  just a constant ache in my right arm, my other beast is full of cyst so that will be hard to check glad of the mammograms. The day of my appointment was 9.00am my consultant was running  late stuck in traffic, I went in about 10.00am he examined me then I went to have a mammogram from there I was then taking into the ultra sound room and had a biopsy while they done the scan I had 4 biopsy on my right breast and two under my arm and 2 biopsy in my other beast. I then went back to the waiting room and by 11.55am I had the results and was told that I would have a operation then chemo then radiotherapy it was all very quick but in a way I was glad that I knew there and then even though it was a lot to take in I can't fault the hospital. I still had to go back two weeks later to get confirmation of the results but I found that a lot easier to handle as I had done all my crying and it also gave me the time to search things and then I told my children after the confirmation as this suited me as I had time to deal with it as I didn't want ti be upset in front of my kids or my mum. Good luck for tomorrow and I think that  is only natural the nausea I was exactly the same the night before I went to see the consultant me and my other half where laughing about it the other night how I kept him up talking most of the night feeling sick and never slept a wink and even now I know this will get us through it and it wil get you through what ever will be tomorrow    xxxxx",
