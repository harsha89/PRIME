      "Content": "After a routine mammogram then a whirlwind of scans and biopsies I was told I had DCIS and it was so widespread that I would need a mastectomy. 2 weeks later I have a 7 hour op to do the mx and immediate reconstruction. They used the Latissimus Dorsi muscle from my back to create a new breast preserving my skin but I lost the nipple. I now have an implant as there wasn't enough of my own tissue to create the \"mound\" (no longer called a breast!) that was 2 months ago and now the implant is folding which is creating deep grooves in the reconstructed breast. Has this happened to anyone else? Does it get better?",
