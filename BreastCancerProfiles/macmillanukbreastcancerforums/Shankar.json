      "Content": "I am in the middle of chemo and have been having oral thrush too. .on Fluconozole now.   Also recently ordered Candida Gone from Amazon hoping it will clear it. I also have mouth ulcers.  I don't know why because I am so obsessed about keeping my mouth clean. I have been advised to rinse my mouth with extra Virgin olive oil, to prevent infections so I am trying that now.  Hope you get over this nasty side effect soon. Hugs x",

      "Content": "Every one is different. Loosing hair is not nice and I miss my long thick hair but I tell myself its temporary  The scalp cooling can make the treatment longer, this was not very practical for me. Also I have brca 1 mutation so I am concerned about brain metastases. I spoke to a chemo nurse who is also a friend and she said you really want the chemotherapy to get to all parts of your body.  There is no evidence that using a cold cap increases risk of brain mets . But I chose not to use it.  It is your choice and I completely understand the importance of not wanting to lose your hair. All the decisions are hard. I hope you get the support and treatment you need  xx Take care x",

      "Content": "Hello Bedford69 I am really sorry to hear that you lost your loved ones through cancer and now you have to fight it x lots of hugs xxx I am BRCA MUTATION 1. I found last July 2015 that I had a lump (invasive ductal carcinoma,triple negative) then had a lumpectomy, started chemo FEC T in September but after 1st FEC had a leaking breast. Had more biopsies and found two more lumps.  MRI showed two nodules in the right breast which showed Atypical lobular hyperplasia and LCIS. So pushed the doctors for bilateral mastectomy without reconstruction. Also pushed for genetic test.  My mum and dad are fine but both grandmothers and aunts on both sides had breast and or ovarian cancers. On 12th November had bilateral mastectomy and also gother the BRCA results that afternoon.  It is surprising that you are brca mutation negative.  Did they tell you that there are three more less popular genes that you can be tested for? The mastectomy was OK I guess. I am blessed with a lovely family and friends who helped by coming in,bringing food and looking after my son ... in the first couple of weeks.  Your insurance company probably won't cover you post op for 6 weeks -you can call and check in case its different. I didn't drive for 6 weeks but went for regular walks to local shops etc x my drains came out after 5 days but I think  it was too soon as I had to go back to the clinic to get my seroma drained. I had a wound complication which meant another procedure in Jan. .. but this is rare if you don't have a reconstruction.  I am now having FEC T . After that radiotherapy and hysterectomy.  So if you have good surgeons and no complications I think 4 to 6 weeks is a good time for recOvery.  Good luck to you. Xx",
