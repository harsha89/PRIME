I\u2019ve got a problem I\u2019m hoping someone will be able to give me some answers to . I hope this is ok ? I had a core biopsy on the 12/12/17 and am waiting for results but I have been told it\u2019s suspicious and there waiting for all results before telling me more . I have never had a lump but puckering . An area was seen on ultrasound and so the core biopsy . I\u2019ve bruised really badly and am black and blue and there is a hard lump under the bruise and it\u2019s stinging . Is this normal ? I\u2019ve also got a small yellow bruise on the side of the same breast and I think this is from the ladies thumb but this is hard too  . Is this normal? X. ",

If your on the bigger breasted size pay particular attention to under your breast . Ditch the bra during treatment if you can. Well placed scarfs disguise a natural boob shape and movement, and use a clean soft cotton hankie just under your breast to stop skin to skin . All the very best sweetheart, it will be over quickly .

I used Aveeno before starting Radiotherapy so as to start with well moisturised skin . I\u2019ve found I need to use 2   sachets of R1 to cover a good area , especially under your breast where you are more likely to get problems . I use 3 sachets of R2 and really slap it on thick and as often as I can . I\u2019m braless at home but still put a clean hankie under my breast to protect from skin in skin friction of any kind and so far so good . 3 zaps to go xxxxx Twinkle51 ",

      "Content": "Hi Mumof3plusoh, all your feelings are very very normal . Anyone talking to me at that stage would have thought I was just popping out for a coffee . I was very positive to the world . When asked I would reply \u201c oh yes I\u2019m very lucky and absolutely fine . \u201c. When I finished my radiotherapy which is now 16 days ago , I felt very strange . I was beside my self and felt all my emotions had been thrown in the air and I couldn\u2019t feel normal or think straight. My Oncologist did say to me that all that had happened would hit me at some time and it did on my last day after treatment and all at once . I was completely disoriented and very tearful and I felt guilty because I have been lucky in a very unlucky situation. I say I\u2019m a lucky unlucky  one . I thought I should just be able to take a deep breath , pat myself on the back and carry on as if nothing had happened. How wrong was I . But 16 days later I\u2019m so much better . I cry at adverts and sob through the whole of Britain\u2018s got Talent , but I\u2019m giving myself permission to just feel .. It\u2019s as though going through treatment I was in a bit of a daze and then suddenly I was aware of everything I\u2019d been through physically and emotionally. just let yourself be love . You\u2019ve done the physical treatment now you have to do the mind and soul treatment. You\u2019ll get there and it won\u2019t take too long . I\u2019m giving you a big hug and a gentle but well deserved pat on the back .  Twinkle51 xx ",

I didn\u2019t hear from mine over xmas and the NewYear because they didn\u2019t want what was happening to me to spoil their celebrations. I had to go to my sisters to pick up some bits for my Mum and there were bottles of champagne by her bins . I was so chocked because it had been an effort for me just to get up and exist and not let my children see or guess how I was feeling . When I went to see a friend for the day my mobile never stopped with instructions from my sister on what needed doing for my Mum . I turned my phone off and when I turned it on a few hours later she\u2019d got herself so worked up .... she had to do the things herself .... shock , horror . BUT to both you and Mazza 10, what I think is that I would never behave this way , I try my best to be kind and considerate whatever I\u2019m going through. If our family can\u2019t and are so selfish then shame on them and it\u2019s their problem not ours . Carry on being good people but as someone mentioned , maintain a dignified silence and distance .

It was rubbish and I was in bits .  The worst thing was there was nothing I could do to change it .... I\u2019d tried to do that during a call I made to my BCN .  All I could do was vent my feelings and worries on this site .  Thinking of you and really feel for you  Xx Maria xx",
