    "Content": "Hi, I've been offered Tamoxifen by my breast surgeon following surgery for DCIS in my right breast. The biopsy results showed my lymph nodes are clear and all the cancer was removed during the surgery. Given all the side effects I'm wondering if tamoxifen is going to be beneficial for me. Any advice appreciated.Â ",
