    "Content": "HI Liz, think recovery is going to be slightly different for different people but it normally takes about a week for the chemo to work through the body, sorry it's not good news but this is normally how long it takes for me and I've had six treatments so far with six more to go.  I cannot say it actually gets better but you sort of get used to it. Eventually the body adjusts, you'll still probably have pain but you will overcome the issue because there is no other choice.  Sorry it's not good news. Regards  Ken. ",
