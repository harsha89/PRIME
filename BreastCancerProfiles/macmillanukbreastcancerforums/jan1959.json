      "Content": "Hi All, I am hoping to go away too in the next few weeks as finished chemo a few weeks ago - awaiting results from scans from Ocologist in August so will wait until then. My question is though - you all seem to mention getting good insurance but with my diagnosis the best i can get is £750 for a single trip to tenerife for two weeks!!! - How do you get affordable insurance. As there are so many flights to and from Tenerife and we stay a 10 minute drive from airport - I am tempted to just go uncovered and fly back if i am unwell - I need a break but can't afford the holiday and the insurance!!!

      "Content": "Hi Kim, I would take the advice of your oncologist and the other ladies on here that advise no. I am on FEC T ( third cycle of three on FEC - go on to T next time. I also feel sick if i have not eaten, so snack all the time when i feel any nausea coming on -  plus the fact it is important not to damage your tummy with the steroids and anti sickness drugs, so they advise they are taken with food. My last FEC treatment was delayed because my Neutrophils were low and the advice i was given was to eat high protein foods and rest - it worked as they went up from 1.3 to - 4.8 in four days so chemo only delayed a few days - personally would not mess with your diet too much other than eating sensibly. Starving your body at such a crucial time, when you need the energy is not what is advised from what i have read. Good luck with the treatment  Jan x As a note - Every persons journey with the chemo is different. I am sailing through mine regarding side effects and i am eating normal balanced diet thought",

      "Content": "Hiya, I was offered either way and chose surgery first too - no regrets from me - Chemo can knock you about and I just too wanted mine out immediately. I finished Chemo 5 weeks ago and still am very tired and not 100% Although i didn't have a full mastectomy I had Lumpectomy and clear margins removed and re constructed my breast with remaining tissue - (lump was high on the breast so would have had an unsightly dip where they had taken it out) . I too was told that no difference either way regarding long term but i wanted it out and the chemo to 'mop up'. Felt really well after my operation with no issues and felt fine starting my chemo. Not sure i would feel up to operation at moment if i had done it the other way round. Personal choice though Hun. Good luck  Jan xxx",

Operation at midday - home by 7 on the night. I was wheeled down to theatre but think that was because the day admission ward was a fair walk away. As Sophie236 and Peggysgirl say, whipping the bra off was so routine i even attempted taking my bra off for a white coated male nurse who had apparently only come to take my height and weight!! :-) Ha Ha  Good luck Jan xx",

      "Content": "Mygel2 Hi Amanda, I'm a nurse myself and have seen ops and had ops so am fairly well versed in what goes on.  Every hospital is slightly different.  Some wards are close to the theatres some are a good walk away. You will be given a gown that does up at the back.  If you are walking to theatre then they will normally give you another gown to wear like a dressing gown over the top of the other one.  You can always take your own with you so you can be reassured that you have one.  If you are going on a trolley you will be covered with a blanket.  You usually get to keep your own knickers on but some hospitals will give you the wonderfully fashionable paper ones.  You won't be able to keep your bra on.  As many of the ladies have said, they usually ask you to slip either one or both of your arms out of the gown but they will continue to keep you covered.  They may attach sticky pads and/or leads (with which to monitor your heart rate), to your chest before you go off to sleep, or they may do this after you are asleep. Theatre staff are usually very considerate of their patients dignity so try not to worry.  Obviously some part of the affected boob is going to be exposed during the operation ...... it has to be for them to see what they are doing. I've had alot of gynaecological surgery (several cameras up my hoohaa), lol, and that is pretty undignified to be honest.  I get the joy of walking round the hospital nodding hello to Doctors and Nurses on a daily basis, who've seen my hoohaa .  My breast surgeons regularly come on to my ward, so now I get the added joy of knowing that the half of the hospital that hasn't seen my downstairs area, have instead seen one or both of my boobs, lmao. Just keep in mind this surgery will save your life!!!!!!! And that is what is important!!!!!! And also, remember they've seen thousands of bodies of all shapes and sizes. Michele Oh gosh this made me laugh too!! - thank you Michele. I too had gyny issues and also a prolapse bowel - so yep not only cameras up the hoohaa but also the doodah!! Will not go into the details where they used a balloon!! lol No wonder i had no issues with the boobs!!",

Thanks for the great advice - omelet and soup diet for a few days and seem to be getting a little easier again now. I also had the custard and remembered my love of cold tinned rice pudding, which was wonderful. Oh and the ice cream.  Also fortunately love creamed mashed potato and cabbage!

      "Content": "Hiya, I have a Hickman line but it is being taken out in two weeks time. My fiend had a port after her pic line didn't work. My opinion on the info I have. Hickman line is very easy to use , but line has to be cleared every week, like a picc line - so one day a week i lose half a day travelling and waiting for them to do line. You can't get a proper shower or go in the bath above your waist. I very often have to go in more than once a week as i react to most dressings. I am also susceptible to infection on the entry site. On saying that it has been great. Unfortunately my hospital do not yet do ports, but a friend of mine had one and loved it - it was slightly above her breast and also still needed line care but not as often - it was not susceptible to  infection and she could swim, bath etc with no problems. I have had the last chemo by cannula  ( my line would not 'produce' although it would except fluid in - nothing would come out!). this is the easiest option if your veins will take it as no in between care.  Overall, personally, if i could get a port I would have one. It is also less visible then a Hickman Line, as when i go out i feel like people look at me and think I must have escaped from hospital, especially in this warmer weather when flimsy cool tops are worn, instead of the big roll neck woolly jumpers!

      "Content": "Hiya - I had very similar side effects and yes they are cumulative - each session getting worse. I was on a different regime to yours (FEC)  but side effects sounds familiar - I was menopausal anyway so the night sweats, lack of sleep etc was just normal to me. The 'woolly head' dizzy if i bent down and general pressure pain i did worry about later in the cycle and was imagining all sorts - when i mentioned it my Oncologist immediately explained it was the chemo and a new level of 'chemo brain' was explained! - best check it out though. The sickness - yes well, apart from the anti sickness they give at the chemo sessions and the anti sickness and steroids to take after for a few days, they gave me a supply of additional anti sickness to take as and when i felt sick - was a little reluctant to take these until my Chemo nurse advised take them before you are sick as once you start it will be more difficult to control. I am four weeks after my last Chemo and am feeling fine now, I must admit though by the 6th treatment i did think i can't stand much more of this. good luck Hun - I am sure by Christmas it will all be done and you will feel much better.
