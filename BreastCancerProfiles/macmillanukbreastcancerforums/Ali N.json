    "Content": "Hi Julie Thanks for raising your question, I am also three rounds in of FEC and about to start DOX which sounds really different prior to surgery and radiotherapy. The replies are all really helpful, other things you may wish to try is a 'Look Good Feel Good' session ask your hospital when they are running, you have make up people giving advice and lots of freebies. Agree about your thoughts re giving up I imagine this is normal for me I am thinking I am giving 2014 to treatment then next year I am going to get my life back. I really hope these comments are helping you, I have never posted before. Take care dear friend and remember you are loved xxx",
