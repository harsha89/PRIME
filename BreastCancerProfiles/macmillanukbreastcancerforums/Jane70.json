      "Content": "Hi Diamonds,  Thank you so much for your advice and support, I really admire your strength in making your decision. I didn't know there could be a chance of getting leukemia when taking FEC, that's so scary.  My Onc was so blunt - she said \"Well, chemotherapy is just poison.\" and left it at that, I just wanted to get out of there, I couldn't think straight. Because the cancer was oestrogen related, were you advised to have an anti-oestrogen diet?  I've cut out milk, cheese, - all sorts, don't know what to eat any more.  Am seeing a dietitian soon for this, I could share the info if you like.

It's so positive and empowering.  Glad you mum was a trouper - she sounds great, really fiesty and glad your sister is getting better :)   I work for Volkswagen and my German colleagues have been so kind :) I'm 95%  sold on Chemo now. You, and all the brave people on this Macmillan site are truly an inspiration to me.  I haven't been told about the cold cap but I would definitely give it a go - was thinking about getting my hair highlighted again but maybe that's not a good idea - my hair isn't very thick and if I keep it natural I might have a better chance of keeping it.  if my mum ever found out I hadn't had Chemo because of her health she'd feel worse and probably freak out too ;)  Thanx for the big hug, sending you one back :)  Jane xxxx",

      "Content": "Hi Zoe,  I was nervous too about the chemo, out of all of it i was dreading it the most, mainly due to other people's experiences but i've learned that everyone reacts differently to it. Do you know which type of chemo you will be having?  I'm having 6 infusions of  FEC, my oncologist told me this is given to ladies whose cancer hasn't spread to the lymph nodes, so maybe you'll have the same.  I too had my shoulder length hair cut to my chin, then to a short pixie cut which is really easy to manage the reason for this is that there is something called a Cold Cap (don't know if you've heard about it) but bascially its a cap they put on your head before and during chemo and it freezes your hair folicles giving you a 60% chance of keeping your hair!  I had it yesterday and it was pretty cold, yes, but bearable and the nurses keep you really warm with blankets and give you hot tea.  So far, after my chemo yesterday I have no side effects!  Hope it stays like that :)  Am here for you anytime, let me know how you get on :)  Jane xxxxxxxxxxx",

      "Content": "Hi Janet :)  I was shaking and breathing hard on my first treatment but they told me to relax and breathe normally and it was ok then. One radiographer said,  'Don't worry it won't hurt, it's not a laser zapping you like on star wars!'  Once I realised the rays don't hurt while youre having the treatment I was ok, afterwards it just felt like i'd been in the sun, keep using the cream all over your effected side including your back, neck, collar bone area etc.  I used simple soap which really helped and drank 2 litres of water a day which helped with the tiredness.  In the end I couldn't believe the last session came about so quickly (had 15 sessions and 5 boosters) and thankfully had no burns.  It's not so bad once you get the first one out of the way.
