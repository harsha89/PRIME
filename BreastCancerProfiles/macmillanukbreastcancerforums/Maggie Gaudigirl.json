But they say the sun is bad when you\u2019re on chemo, so I\u2019ll have to leave my going out to the night time.  I\u2019m in the Hospital Sant Pau , and my oncologist is the consultant there, I\u2019m lucky, a friend put in a good word for me with him. But I won\u2019t meet him till September, pity.  I odered a wig online but the WiFi connection was bad and I clicked too many times. In the end I ordered 4 of the same!! Over a grand!! ive written to them and I\u2019m waiting for a reply, I can\u2019t seem to do anything g right these days!  I WILL get through this, I know I will, it\u2019s just as you said too many bad things have happened and it sometimes gets to me.  Mom normally a happy go lucky person, it\u2019s not like me to be so down, which is probably why I\u2019m not coping too well.  Thanks again xx",

Strain it and put it in the fridge, every time you walk by give yourself drink and swirl it around your mouth a few times, even gargle, take it to your sessions too! It works!! And can stop the mouth ulcers!!  Anyone got any more tips? ",

It\u2019s teied and tested.  It also makes you drink more water, so it\u2019s two birds one stone!!  Anything that\u2019s keeping you hydrated can\u2019t be bad!! ",
