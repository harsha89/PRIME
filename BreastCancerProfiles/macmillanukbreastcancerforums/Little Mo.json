    "Content": "Hello Tinker, just wanted to say that feeling nervous& anxious is normal. I was a nervous wreck on my first chemo session. It's fear of the Unknown & nobody who hasn't been through it really knows how you feel. You will be fine & things are not as bad as you imagine them to be. I know everyone is different, but staying positive is a must. It's getting rid of the cancer, and it will be over soon. Keep that in mind. I tried the cold cap. After the first session I said never again! This was only because others said it doesn't work anyway, so why put yourself through it. Believe it or not I carried it on for the rest of my chemo sessions! I kept my hair!! It got a little thinner , but you couldn't even notice it! I know it doesn't work for everyone, but it's worth a try! I hope all goes well for you. Stay positive & strong. Remember this period of treatment will soon be over !Â ",
