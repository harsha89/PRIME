      "Content": "I\u2019ve just been put on vit D following a diagnosis of osteoporosis.saw the Gp today and asked did I need any blood tests as I didn\u2019t know if my levels were low or high.she said if they tested everyone in Manchester at this time of year most would be low!.however she decided I should have a test done then depending on results she could adjust my dosage.wouldn\u2019t it be cheaper for the nhs if I had the test first as if I need to change drugs then I will have to throw the pack I have now.seems silly to me. I had to laugh when she looked at me and said I look like I get plenty of vit D from being outdoors. I\u2019m pale and totally unfit.the opposite of an outdoorsy type though I used to be out everyday with school runs/parks,garden as a childminder and walking my dog twice a day.now I just manage a couple of short school runs a week and am trying to build up my dog walking.can only do about 1/2 hour at the moment.",
