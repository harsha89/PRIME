I've been on antidepressants for years and usually manage quite well- and have developed excellent faking skills when not so well! tomorrow's appt will hopefully be to find out if they got clear margins and if lymph nodes were clear i already know chemo is on the cards as it's Her2+, hence the knowledge that it's going to take a long time before everything's finished i know everyone dreads that part and I'm no exception anyone know when chemo starts after surgery? all the best on your journeys",

It could be just relief that \"something is finally happening\" instead of all the waiting for tests, results and appointments And probably a bit of denial too, which might be a good thing as it gives you some protection from strong emotions Even now I'm bald and on chemo, I still find it hard to think of myself as a cancer patient! I wish you all the very best Just be aware the anaesthetic after effects might hit you later- about day 9 after surgery I had a very dark day of depression and felt unable to cope, but by the next day was ok again Let us know how you get on x",

My tumour was small but already in lymph node...I turned 64 just before chemo started and have every intention of many more good years.

      "Content": "Hi Sarah Sorry to hear you're having problems with Docetaxol I had a bad reaction with the first one, but after that they gave me pre Meds and a slower infusion They may reduce the dose, or try another drug I had the drug reduced twice, then stopped after 4 rounds- latest MRI was clear The nurse said reactions are very common, so maybe they need to give it slower, or your onc may decide on something else Hope you get it sorted soon, I'm sure you could do without the worry at the moment On the plus side, the treatment will come to an end eventually- it's 4 weeks today since my last chemo, and I'm feeling reasonably ok, apart from some lingering fatigue All the best, keep us updated x",

They will give you med's for any side-effects- probably best to take the anti sickness ones as a precaution, before anything happens! Wishing you all the best x",

      "Content": "hi all I felt very tired after chemo no2 (TCH) so the oncologist reduced the dose Had chemo 3 yesterday and have just had a call from GP to say my haemoglobin is low. As I eat red meat, dark green veg and lots of fruit, I asked what I more I could do but she said it isn't diet- related and is ordering a different sort of blood test for iron stores, which is apparently separate from the iron circulating in the blood. Just wondering if anyone else has had this, and what treatment they gave you? Many thanks x",

Obviously glad about not having any more injections, but can\u2019t rejoice yet as not had Mammogram results, it\u2019s been more than 2 weeks since and haven\u2019t heard anything, in a way I don\u2019t want to find out! It\u2019s been a 15 month roller coaster ride, so to everyone going through it- it does come to an end eventually, so hang on in there. Would be nice to hear other people\u2019s experiences of finishing treatment Love to all xxx",
