    "Content": "Hi everyone I\u2019m a newbie (to breast cancer and to this site). I was wondering if anyone has had any experience with delayed pathology results after surgery? I had a mastectomy and axillary lymph node clearance on 8th Jan but I am still waiting to see my surgeon for a follow up and to get my results. I\u2019ve had the appointment cancelled three times so far as the results aren\u2019t ready. Does a month seem like a long time to wait or have others had a similar waiting time? Thank you for reading xÂ ",
