I'm not having radiotherapy but you shouldn't be in that much pain when being in the position for treatment. If you are then you really need some hands on physio to help stretch you out. There is a good team at Guys if you need to see someone there, or maybe you have to see someone in your local hospital. I have seen a physio called Rebecca at the cancer centre.  There is a physio on this site too who has been very helpful when I have messaged them.  Good luck tomorrow. If you need a friendly hug afterwards let me know, Nicky x",

      "Content": "Dolina, swampy1901 , kristiina , ronstar , Ladies, thank you so much for your replies. My internet has been off so I'm sorry for the late response. So, today went better than I imagined. I was initially assessed by their senior reg and then the bigger team came in. They in fact were very professional but also very kind and made me feel comfortable. I did take a friend with me and had my questions written down. There were 2 consultants, plus three others and the female consultant then sat down with me after the physical assessment.  Apparently I do have enough tummy fat to create 2 breasts of similar size to my own without \"down sizing\" . I was kind of hoping that they would say that I haven't so that I had no decision. I am feeling more inclined towards the DIEP now as the resulting breast is soft and warm.... I am still frightened of the length of the surgery and as I am having both done this is extended again. But, they do lots of these surgeries and the fact that I am post-chemo doesn't seem to have thrown them. They like a 5-6 week gap to make sure your bloods are back to normal.  Dolina, you had your surgery in June. So you are in your third month post op. Can I ask if you approaching a time where you would think of going back to work once you are through your 3 month recovery period?  Swampy1901, how long post op are you now?  Can I ask you all about the tummy scar? Is it nice and even ? I have a friend who had a DIEP about 6 weeks ago and her tummy scar looks quite uneven and bumpy.... Kristiina , I do hope that you are feeling ok after your first EC. I found that the first week was a bit of a write off for me but that I turned a corner at about days 7-8. My third week was almost back to normal. The repetition is tough, but keep reminding yourself that it doesn't last and that weeks 2 and 3 are ok.  Ronstar , how did you get on today ? Your experience with the plastics team sounds dreadful.... Plenty of women choose not to have reconstructions, I'm not quite sure why they are being so cautious with your decision. And of course, if you do change your mind in later years you can look at this again.  I feel no closer to my decision but I do feel calmer about it.  I will have more questions for you all but I am so tired tonight. Time to switch off my head and watch the olympics.  Sleep well ladies, love Nicky x",

I am BRCA 1 so will be having bilateral mastectomy.  I am still in a huge quandary about the type of reconstruction to have done. I have narrowed my choice down to two types: pre-pectoral implant with acellular matrix, or the DIEP. I have met with the breast surgeon that does the implant procedure and now I have an appointment with the plastic surgeons on Monday.  I have already been warned by my oncologist and one of the BCN's that the assessment will not be easy> the plastic surgeons forget that they are doctors and that they should be taking care of the patient.  That aside, do any of you that have been here before me have any tips on what questions to ask, how to prepare for the assessment, how not to cry when they treat me like a ...... I'm scared of the DIEP, but my oncologist was pleased that I am at least meeting with them to find out what they can do. She described me as a young woman (I'm 49) and I love her for that! Nicky x",

I asked the physio or nurse, I forget which, and she said that the drains do track around there. Like you, I am very much hoping that this isn't as good as it gets. Sometimes I feel that I'd like to be able to take the boobs off with my bra. Do others have this bruised feeling all the time? It is much worse in the evenings.  One thing that I perhaps should say about healing: the physio told me that it takes around 2 years for the healing and remodelling of the healing tissues to take place. Now, this I suppose gives us all hope that our new boobs, or absence of breasts, whichever we are dealing with, still has time to get better.  Sleep well ladies, Nicky x",

He/she is more likely to know how to help and indeed who to refer you on to. Anaesthetists are experts in pain management, not just surgery related anaesthesia.  I would suggest that you contact your consultant or BCN to arrange an urgent appointment with the doctor. A phone call to the consultants secretary might be needed (that number can usually be found on the trusts website when you search for the consultant by name). This is about pain relief. It may be that the plates securing your sternum have loosened: I'm saying this because it isn't necessarily about a deterioration in the Mets, if this makes sense. It may not be this either, but I suggest it because we need our rounded problem solving heads on here.  Good luck: call them today to get that appointment, and don't be brave when you talk to them. Let them know that you are struggling and that this needs addressing now, not in 2 weeks time.  Love Nicky X",

It should help you to sleep and in lower doses helps with neuropathic pain (caused by nerve irritation) . As you say, it is traditionally used as an antidepressant.  Do go back to see her as planned as she may need to play with your dose.  It can make you feel a bit hungover next day but hopefully won't on your start up dose. As with all painkillers,  aim to keep taking them in a systematic way to keep a level of meds in your system. It's much harder to deal with pain once it's kicked in.  I very much hope that you begin to feel better soon. I've been there with the more junior doctor in oncology.  She meant well but it was a waste of time..  Love Nicky xx By the way: no more apologising. Not to us anyway xx",

Of course I've no idea how much will come out in the end but it has made me feel a bit low.  I've got my NHS wig appt on Wednesday. And I have found some lovely bamboo chemo hats on-line that I will order just on case. The thought of going to work without hair just fills me with horror...I have read the Paxman coolcap info though and it does encourage that we persevere, and so I will use it again on Friday.  Nicky ",

      "Content": "Hello! I began my chemo (EC) on the 18th March, so I have only had one session. I went through the same Decision making as you with the whole cold cap issue. In the end I decided to go ahead with it. I too had my hair cut into a shorter style just shorter than shoulder length.  So, the first 15-20 minutes are pretty uncomfortable and I sat there thinking: I can't do this....But then it truly does ease off. I took the advice about taking some paracetamol before hand, which I suspect helped. My treatment itself lasted about 1.5 hours: the cap had to be on for 30-40 minutes before and remain on for an extra 90 mins. The time went more quickly than I thought it would. I didn't feel unwell during treatment. In fact I was fine. The only thing was that I felt a bit \"woozy\" which my nurse told me was an effect of the cold cap: that went as soon as it came off.  I didn't get a headache and took a thick fleecy blanket and so didn't feel cold in my body. I drank hot tea! I was really hungry by lunchtime and enjoyed my hospital sandwich!  The lady opposite me told me that she had not bothered with the cold cap: couldn't face it. It is a very personal decision I think.  Good luck. I have my second cycle on the 8th.  Nicky ",

I had two removed on Tuesday: 2 more to go.  I was stung by a wasp on my right boob recon while walking from the hospital to the car....would you believe it. So now I'm on more antibiotics and some antihistamine to try and calm it down. It's made the breast hypersensitive to touch (where there is sensation that is). Like I needed that I hadn't thought about the thing of phantom sensation for you: that's pretty upsetting. I haven't looked at mine properly. I have looked down at them and today I washed where I could and did take a wee look in the mirror. One side looks a little sad and has \"drooped\" more than the other. I know that it's early days so I am not forming opinions yet. They certainly look fine in my clothes. So this is good. The whole tightness sensation of the recon is difficult and I am stll taking all my pain killers: hence the constipation But, I had wonderful news about my path report: The breast tissue was clear and so were my lymph nodes. So, my treatment worked and I won't need radiotherapy So, one day at a time. I feel that I should be celebrating but in fact I feel quite low: big hugs coming your way xxx",

Perhaps once you are feeling better you could venture to Guys to try on the Amoena bras: you wouldn't need to be a patient there as it is a shop on the ground floor of the new cancer centre. They have a fitting room.  I've had a tough day with another extra appt at the breast clinic as my blood cell counts are still low from chemo. Big debate about whether to delay or not. Anyway, going ahead with antibiotic cover and filgrastem injections. My oncologist sort of gave the go ahead but it's all pretty confusing to be honest. Then the ward phones to ask when I'll arrive tonight! I was in nuclear medicine having my glow in the dark injection and I had a mini-meltdown there and then. A lovely staff member rescued me with tissues and a cup of water. Anyway, the upshot is that I will go in the morning afterall.  So, here we both go! Good luck for next week: we can do this.

I haven't read all of this thread yet, but I think we can all relate to the thing of protecting others from how we really are inside.  The day after my final chemo I went to see my family for my mothers 80th birthday doo. It was also meant to celebrate my end of chemo, although that seemed to get lost in the mix..Anyway, my Dad said \"oh you look well, you even have a tan!\" I was so fed up: I promptly told him that my \"tan\" was actually my steroid flush (I'd woken up with that cherry red flush over my face and neck\" and that I was wearing lots of makeup. I felt mean afterwards though....the truth isn't really wanted for the most part.  I have had a couple of meltdowns along the way....I turned up at clinic on one particular day, after a bad week of appts that didn't happen for one reason or another, to be told that my appt for that day didn't exist at all and that the text reminder they had sent was in error. I stood and burst into floods of tears at reception. The team did them pull together to support me though and I was fitted in to see the oncologist. So meltdowns can be recieved properly.  I have also melted down twice at home in front of my ex-partner....becoming almost hysterical. The emotions do bubble over at times.  Having said all that, I do try and put on an upbeat positive face for most of the time.  My surgery is on Saturday and I am terrified if I am very honest. I still cry a lot over it: but not as much as I did a few weeks ago.  Take care all of you, Nicky xxx",

It usually takes 3 months for test results to come through, but in fact they can fast track them if they need to. Mine were back in plenty of time to re-plan my second half chemo. I am BRCA1, and my follow up chemo was 12 X Paclitaxol weekly, in combination with 3 X 3 weekly cycles of Carboplatin. This combo has been trialled in Oxford for BRCA carriers. I am not triple negative, but I am only weakly oestrogen positive.  The Paclitaxol/carbo combination is doable: there are side effects of course which I can run by you if you want me to. It was very wearing....I will say that. Weekly Taxol seems to be easier in some ways than 3 weekly Docataxol from what I have read.  Good luck with this. Take one week at a time and don't project too far forward. It's easier to deal with that way.  Nicky x",

A few weeks later my brows and lashes began to push through and once growing they do lengthen surprisingly quickly. It was odd though, becuase it was as if the last few bits on my head and elsewhere was pushed out first by the new hair while it was still below skin.  I think I probably have the Judge Rinder doo at the moment expect that one is surprisingly dark on top and silvery at the sides. My brows have become quite bushy  I now have pubes and everything LOL . As other ladies have also mentioned , I also have a full beard but the less said the better...I'm waiting for that to go away! How long post chemo is a difficult one: I am now 2 1/2 months finished, but it was the EC that stripped me of my hair really and that was finished back in June.

Something my (supportive) sister said of some of my own family, is that people's odd behaviours simply become bigger and more obvious when they are under stress. So your family's ability to back off and deny your situation to themselves has always been there by the sounds of it: and at the moment they are using this to keep the most enormous gap between you. As others have said, you need to protect yourself from this now. Only keep your loving friends around you.  I feel very self-concious indeed about my hair loss at the moment: if I make eye contact with people I feel guilty that I am pushing evidence of my cancer in their faces... So, I contacted my local *Look Good, Feel Better* workshop. I go this aftrenoon to learn how to use makeup to make myself feel stronger. I don't use makeup much at all as a rule but this feels like a really postive step. A pampering aftrenoon. And they give you a goody bag of products! It will be a small group of women, all going through cancer treatment.  Maybe contact this yourself and book on a session. (They last 2 hours).  Are you nearly at the end of chemo?

      "Content": "Hello Dreamthief, Thanks for your reply. It seems to be everywhere but especially on my limbs. My feet are a little more sore than they were: the neuropathy has improved a lot, which is great, but my toe nails are a strange dark colour  near their tops (farthest away from the nail bed) and are a bit sore. My heels are also very dry (I don't usually have a problem with this at all) and the right one is quite sore at times.  I'm using a good moisturiser but my arms and legs look like an elderly persons and are shedding. It's pretty gross! I can now shower as my drains are out: I'm thinking of a bath tomorrow with some coconut oil in the water. I'm reluctant to exfoliate or anything as it might make my skin sore. Could it also be because my body hair has begun to push through: I'm wondering if it disturbs the epidermis?  Good to know that it might be the chemo: hopefully it won't get much worse. I remember seeing one poor lady in chemo who had clearly developed a nightmarish skin condition and she had to see the dermatologists.  Thanks for any advice: I hope that you and your wife are well, Nicky xx",

I had a few \"core\" biopsies taken during my diagnosis: I don't know if this is what you are having but they do numb the area with a local anaesthetic first. The gadget they use makes a fairly loud click (a bit like the old ear lobe gun thingy that used to be used for pearcing ears ). You'll be bruised afterwards and it may be a bit sore: especially if they need to take a sample from close to your nipple. But other than that it is fine. I try to use deep breathing during stuff like that and think of my lovely dog: happy thoughts. It does help to reduce your anxiety and is a good distraction technique, so that the whole thing is over very quickly.  My radiologist (and I see the same woman each time) is incredibly kind and gentle too: they know very well how scared you are.  Take care, Nicky X",

My mum had 3 seperate primaries of breast cancer and did not have chemo for any of them. She is now in her 80th year! Not everyone has chemo even now.  My own chemo was 4 Epirubicin with cyclophosphamide followed by 12 weeks of Paclitaxel with 4x3 week cycles of Carboplatin. The second half was targeting my BRCA diagnosis. I will have tamoxifen although my tumour is only weakly ER+. There is a study in Oxford that my treatment pathway is following.  I think we are all different with the amount of information we want and benefit from. I haven't done too much reading and have ignored all statistics.... My mind focused hugely on the surgical decisions because they were mine to make but I have trusted my oncologist implicitly to treat me in the right way. And she is so lovely: very kind and thoughtful.  Good luck with your oncology appt Lisab. Terry: we are a similar age. I am 49. So here's to much more than 10 years Gentle hugs , Nicky x",

Although I must admit that being on the train with 2 drains in still was a bit freaky! I was very concious of not wanting people to see them but the journey home was better as they had been taken out. I have to say that my journeys to the hospital by taxi were more difficult as the road surfaces are awful in London and I was so swollen and sore the next day.  I had bath yesterday which was lovely but getting out was a challenge: if you do have one then turning around in the water to be on all fours is the way to go. You can then get up using your leg muscles rather than your arms. I was also so tired afterwards that I was wiped out for most of the day! I had an amazing anaesthetist who gave me a nerve block that made my first few days much easier than I had anticipated. Are you sore around your chest wall just below your armpits? I'm wondering how much breast tissue is taken from that area as well, as this is very sore for me.  I begin my more active physio exercises today which will be another challenge: watch this space :|  Take care: how are you feeling today? Rotten luck with needing chemo. I have completed mine so I'm glad of that. Bl***** bad luck that this is a recurrence for you. I have the BRCA mutation which is why I opted for bilateral surgery: my tumour was on the left so my right mastectomy was prophylactic.  As you say, keep smiling but cry when you need to, Nicky xx",

I found it helped so that I wasn't projecting too far ahead and so coped with the side effects one drug at a time. I will say that the run up to the beginnings of chemo is worse than the reality: that won't stop you being anxious of course but once you have one down you know what you are dealing with. It's surprising how quickly it becomes your new routine, which actually does help I think. The repetition is tough: keep reminding yourself that it will pass and that next week you will feel better The chemo club on here is invaluable: you'll find that you will be going through your treatment with lots of others at the same time and that everyone will help you. If you have an \"oncology helpline\" at your hospital don't be afraid to use it. Mine was brilliant, even when I rang up with awful constipation! The nurse on the line told me exactly what to do and what to take. And didn't make me feel foolish. Flag up any side effects that concern you straight away too. There is always something that they can do to help.  Ronstar, how are you this week? And yes, hold on to that thought: 3 times a lady at 80!! Love to all, Nicky xx",

It was delivered very quickly too but you could ask them to be extra speedy!  How am I ? Still pretty uncomfortable but getting my drains out has made quite a difference. And I got to my 2 hospital appts this week by train which I was pleased about. My pathology results were excellent which is a huge boost.

It's very soothing and non-irritating.  Tell your oncologist about the acid reflux and constipation: they can give you Omeprazole for the heartburn which works really well. Just one a day. I took something called Laxido which is the same as Movicol for constipation: again, works well but is gentle. Also tell them about the nausea: they have a range of meds that they will try you on. After the first session of chemo you pretty much know how your body is going to respond and so you can arm yourself with the right kit.  Well done for getting through week one. It's a shock to the system.  Big hugs, Nicky x",

If not, phone them today, tell the receptionist that you are on chemo and that you need an appointment to see someone today. If necessary, cry on the phone! That should work This way, you will get the prescription that you need but also reassurance. He/she may suggest only using some of the potions that you now have or prescribe a different mouthwash. Perhaps you are sensitive to the difflam, I don't know.  Hang in there. When do you next see your oncologist? Do you see them prior to each chemo session? If not, phone for an appt with them too. I found that I needed reassurance as much as anything else. That is what they are there for.  Take care, Nicky x",

Is is a very local pain or is it radiating anywhere else e.g. Into your buttock or down the back of your leg? Have you had an assessment by anyone e.g. Your GP or a physio in the past?  As you can probably guess from my questions, I am a physio myself! I would be cautious about using a DIY ultrasound device. It will I assume be geared up for self-administration, but ultrasound can be pretty powerful and do harm as well as good. I would initially try a good old fashioned therapy that does help a lot: a nice hot water bottle or wheat pack. There is also a product called a Pain Pen which uses electrical signals to mimic electro acupuncture and you use it over specific acupoints: you would struggle to use this on yourself on your back though. A TENS machine would also be a safe option: you can them at larger Boots stores. A low frequency stimulation again mimic electro acupuncture.  Most low back pains settle of their own accord and are quite innocent muscle problems or local small joint inflammation: hopefully this will be the case. If it doesn't settle, I would ask your GP for a physio referral or see one privately at a good clinic: you are likely to only need a couple of sessions which makes it more affordable.  Good luck, Nicky xx",

Most electrotherapies  increase blood supply to an area which you wouldn't want for tumours as they would be supplied with more nutrients and stuff. In addition, ultrasound (if not used correctly) can cause something called cavitation which seriously excites and damages tissues. US used and bouncing off bones can be painful too so there are lots of reasons not to use near a tumour but also on a DIY basis too. Prescribed by and used by a physio though and it should be safe (away from site of tumour).  Glad to hear that you are more comfortable today.

      "Content": " Hi Pepsicat , I was put on a 3 week cycle of Carboplatin with a weekly cycle of Paclitaxol. This came after 4 cycles of EC. This change to my chemo was because I have a BRCA1 gene mutation: this regime has been trialled and seen to be useful. My tumour is also ER+ but only 4/8 receptors, so is considered to be weakly positive.  So, my Carboplatin dose was given in combination with the Paclitaxol. I would say that the Carboplatin was tougher than the Paclitaxol: both drugs tend to lead to a peripheral neuropathy, although the Paclitaxol is considered to be worse. Both could also damage your nails: I oiled mine faithfully and also used Evonail and I have gotten away with my nails being ok. The week after the Carboplatin I felt much more tired. It also constipated me very badly: watch out for this. It is the drug rather than you not eating the right things. Some people will develop diarrhoea instead, so let your oncology team know. I ended up phoning my helpline and was given advice about what to take, and then continued with a laxative regime until the end of chemo. The constipation then also gave me piles....bloody painful I have to say so let them know if this happens too.  I think that the Carboplatin may give some hair loss, but mine was already gone from the EC!  Overall, the carbo/pacl regime was easier than the EC. No sickness or nausea, so that is good. Your sense of taste is likely to be affected...I didn't get anything too awful but everything just tasted kind of dull and my appetite dropped a bit.  I also got heartburn for a few days after each dose and was prescribed Omeprazole. This helped a lot but also sleeping on several pillows for that time helped too.  My skin has been very dry and so I have used a rich natural body lotion and face mousturiser.  My oncologist told me that it was the Paclitaxol that gives the peripheral neuropathy more than the Carboplatin but I found that it got a lot worse on my carbo week. It is mainly a sensory neuropathy: tingling, buzzing, loss of sensation, soreness. But you may not get this if you are only on carbo.  So, it is a kinder drug than the EC combination. Mine was all put through my PICC line becuase my veins were a little tired after the EC.  Good luck: do ask again if you are struggling with anything. Always remember that while the side effect list on paper is long and scary, you won't get all of them.  Nicky xx ",

More of a nuisance than anything else. It impacts on your cell counts too but your oncologist will keep an eye on that. I needed an infusion as I became pretty anaemic and twice chemo was postponed with my neutrophils being too low.  Take it easy and get plenty of rest when you need it: it is however very doable.  I see your radiotherapy has finished today: yay!!!

My eyes are sore again today, so I expect to lose the rest over the next few days. Without any eyeliner or eyebrow \"paint\" I look so odd... But, at least the makeup does help a little. I'm always paranoid that I have made myself look like a cartoon with the eyebrows, but now that \"Manchester\" brows are in I guess I can't really go wrong.  Anyone using a really \"brilliant\" eyebrow fix? I'm using Lancôme gel brow stuff.... I don't usually wear much makeup, so it's been a steep learning curve!!

So, I thought that I would miss them. But, I don't!  I was offered a nipple graft at the time: mine own split grafted onto my skin, but the thought of it necrosing and dropping off was too much.  Like you Carolyn, I think because I don't yet view my boobs as my breasts, not having a nipple really doesn't matter. I have looked, out of curiousity, at tattoos, but I'm unlikely to bother. But I am only 4 months post-op, so I may change my mind over time.  Nicky x",

The cancer centre itself is a regional one, so I guess their through put is high. Good idea to look at their private practice info too: I haven't done that yet. One of the STH surgeons has created (with colleagues) a website called www.brafoundation.co.uk which has good summaries of all available procedures, so I have looked at that. I'm also being a complete wimp and leaning towards the matrix/implant reconstruction because it is the most straight forward and only one incision. Faster recovery. I'm self employed and this feels important. The use of the matrix seems to create a more natural looking breast. Are you pleased with your implants? How do they feel? Nicky xx",

If you are on tamoxifen not all SSRI's can be used as some conflict with the oestrogen suppression.

I have bilateral mastectomy with immediate recon using implants over the muscle.  I belong to a knitting group that meets weekly on a Tuesday evening. I haven't actually been to a meeting for months: I became too tired partway through my chemo to go out in an evening and I have been hibernating ever since! After surgery I was in too much discomfort as my pain would escalate in the evening and I would long for my bed...now I am feeling a lot better and have started back at work 2 days a week for the past month.  One of my friends, whom I met in the knitting group, has kept in close touch and I have seen her periodically. She in fact came with me to my first chemo session and stayed a couple of nights while I threw up!! Now, I know that I asked her to let people in the group know that I was \"having treatment\". I had told a few myself that I am closer too. She emailed me this week to say that she had seen one chap in the group and had told him that I had mastectomy and recon with implants. She told me about this because this particular man is something of a conspiracy theorist, and apparently was greatly alarmed that I had implants. He was equally alarmed about the fact that I was having chemo.... Anyway, my issue is that she has told anyone about the details of my surgery....it feels too intimate. It has really upset me. I now feel that I don't want to go back to the group at all. I feel that all anyone needed to know, if they asked, was that I'd \"had surgery\". In fact, most people shy away from it: including the friend that has passed this information to others in the group. She has never asked me directly about my surgery or how I feel about it: last time I saw her I mentioned about massaging my scars, in relation to her own knee surgery scar, and she pulled a \"disgusted\" face, which made me feel really great! I haven't responded yet....I don't want to upset her. But I know that it's going to fester in my own mind.  Be honest with me: am I being Oversensitive?  Nicky X",

We do have a couple of guys and unfortunately it's fair to say they are both a little,,,something. Not sure what! But, there are plenty of men that knit and are really good at it.  AS for the conspiracy theorist: having to field off his stuff will be difficult, but he's old enough to be told to simply leave it alone.  At Christmas, my mum suddenly piped up while we were all opening our presents that she'd been meaning to ask if I was happy with my implants.....I was a bit stumped, said it was too early to say and my brother in law then rescued me by changing the subject.  Nicky xx",

I also decided (at the last minute) to lose my nipples, and I don't really miss them. Only on one occasion, when I took my bra off sitting down and looked down briefly at myself and had an odd shock , almost as if I had forgotten that they are not there.  My scars (horizontal like yours) are beginning to really tone down colour wise. I think in the end they will become quite silvery. I was extremely lucky and had no wound infection or seroma. I did have quite alot of pain: mostly neurogenic, so lots of shooting pains and nasty tingling. But that has now gone. My skin is of course numb and in some places hypersenstive still, but so much better than it was.  AS you say, seeing pictures helps a lot with decision making. My new boobs do Soemtimes feel too big....I suspect that they are pretty much the same size as before, but they are firmer and of course don't behave in the same way as real breast tissue. But having said that, because they are over the muscle they do jiggle quite a bit and when I went into the Genetics Clinic the other week she had to ask if I'd had them done already. THey apparently look very natural! So, getting there. I found the recovery came in stages: I would plateau and feel that it would never get better and then suddenly it did! Love Nicky x",

I was going to ask if you had considered recon with an implant in front of the pectoral muscle with a matrix to support it but I see that you are having radiotherapy....this changes things of course. The MDT don't plan for me to have radiotherapy (my nodes were clear on core biopsy) but of course I haven't had proper sentinel node sampling yet. I'm curious about your decision not to have recon: I can understand the fear of surgery becuase this is why I am looking at what I see as the \"simplest\" type.

And whatever we all choose can be changed later: by which I mean that you could opt for a delayed recon if you find that this is what you want later on. Your breast surgeon will hopefully bear this in mind when they do your mastectomy. All these decisions are intensely personal and do depend on so many things.

The sensory neuropathy seems to be getting much worse, despite the Paciltaxel having been reduced by 20%. I'm wondering how bad I should \"let\" it get before asking my Oncologist about it again: I only saw her last week.  How quickly does it tend to get better once chemo is finished?  I had two units of blood yesterday to bring up my red cell count: feel a bit better today although I haven't really walked anywhere yet. Feeling pretty fed up this week....the piles are back....I feel guilty for feeling low as I know that others having it so much worse.  Nicky",

Blimey, no wonder I feel like I'm falling to bits I don't have complete numbness: that I suppose would be easier to flag up. I had a bit of pain in my left hand and both feet which then resolved into reduced sensation aftre a few days. I can say that the reduced sensation extends into my lower legs and forearms. After last weeks double dose it got worse. It isn't so bad that I can't do things: I can knit and do buttons etc, which I think I've been using as my yardstick. I think I'm afraid that I will suddenly get a lot worse and my balance will be affected and I'll need a stick.... And the other day I picked up a feather and then couldn't feel it once I had put it into my pocket. Also, I think I have just emotionally had enough to tell you the truth. This week has been tough and I keep crying.  Just feeling generally sorry for myself I guess.  Nicky ",

Interestingly some are used for teaching new mums how to breast feed as well as an alternative to a prosthesis. To make one out of a bamboo blend yarn would be lovely as it is such a soft fibre, very breathable and antibacterial too.  I had a bilateral mastectomy with recon in October. Clearly I do have two breasts of sorts, but the issue of bras is similar in terms of comfort. After a recon you don't need pocketed bras but you still need something really soft and without any seaming in the cups as the skin is so thin and marks really easily. I still have all the discomfort that the mastectomy brings, plus the weight of the prosthetic inside me. So, the market is there: for all of us. Somedays I wish I'd simply gone flat so that I could just wear a vest, but of course that would also be a tough choice. I'm not sure that there is an ideal is there? We have a touch of snow today: no sweating here except with the hot flushes! Nicky x",

      "Content": "Hello Barfy , Scared shitless: that made me smile. The morning of my surgery, I went in for 7;30 am as asked, but I needed my bloods checked again as chemo had left me with low white blood cells. Anyway, it meant a delay from 1st up to later in the morning. I must have been into that loo with \"loose bowels\" about 6 times in the intervening few hours. I was literally scared ***** Ask away on the questions. I became more and more anxious over that week too. Try and distract yourself with stuff. I was up to the hospital nearly every day for bloods, dressings , clinic....in hind sight although it was the week from hell, all the tooing and froing did keep me occupied.  There were 3 of us on the theatre list when I was in: that night the nurse on our bay came round with cups of tea in the middle of the night! She was lovely.   Someone here said to not eat too much in the aftrenoon after you wake up. I remember I was actually very hungry, ate well and was fine. But then I had a big glass of ginger cordial and promptly threw it back up lol. I didn't have a sick bowl so I grabbed the plastic rubbish bag taped to my bed table  I felt hugely better afterwards and had to press the buzzer to hand the bag to a nurse! Oh how we laughed.... You're a strong northern lass...you are going to be just fine.  Love Nicky x",

      "Content": "Hi Lou loulou1007 , My work situation is a bit complicated as I a self-employed. If I'm honest, I don't want to go back yet.....but, the regular work that I have is 2 days a week in a nursing home (I'm a physio). So, it will be relatively easy to spread my hours over the week. The physical problems will be that I need to be pretty strong to do my job , so I'll need to be careful.  The psychology of it is another thing ! So, I had chemo first and worked through a lot of it, taking the week off after chemo, but that tailed off as I became less and less well. My surgery was on 8-10-16 and I haven't worked since 7-09-16. My sister got on the phone and applied for Employment Support Allowance for me the week after surgery.  Looking at your profile, I can see that you are still having your rads? So I'm not surprised you don't feel ready. Everyone that I've spoken to about work has said, go back when you are ready, take your time. I attended a \"Next Steps\" seminar at Guys a couple of weeks ago. Had a really interesting talk from a lovely lady about going back to work after cancer. She absolutely advised ony going back when you are ready, and that you and your manager need to know that a phased return after cancer treatment is not straight forward. That we don't progress in a linear way, and that we can take one step forward and 4 back, as things like fatigue take their toll, peripheral neuropathy still lingering, etc etc.  Do you mind me asking what you do?  Nicky x",

      "Content": "Hello Barfy, How are you feeling tonight? Big hug for you.  One of the things I feared post op was not being able to manage the loo on my own....rest assured that was fine.  One thing, try not to compare yourself to those that recover very quickly: it took quite a while for my pain to go. Yes, you will have some pain in the weeks after surgery,but that is quite normal and once I realised that this was the case, it was much easier to deal with. The pain does go, and so do take your pain killers as you need them. I guess what I am saying, is that the weeks that you need those pain killers comes to an end, so don't be anxious about taking them. The codeine preparations can make you very constipated: forewarned is forearmed with laxatives and prunes! So, there is discomfort and some pain, which is normal, but at no point was it really bad. So, you can get through it. I no longer need any pain killers. We are all different so get on here and ask us questions and also phone and ask your BCN or physio. I found the reassurance they gave me invaluable. I even asked to see the BCN as an extra appt to check my wounds. All was fine.  I'm meeting with my manager tomorrow to plan my phased return to work. I feel anxious about work, but I do think it will help me to move forward as they say! Take it easy, allow others to help you and do your physio exercises with devotion   Where is your hospital? I was at Guys in London: ward staff were just lovely and I felt very looked after.  Hugs, Nicky X Oh, I meant to say. If you have a sensitivity to dressing adhesives, tell them when you check in and they ask about allergies. My wounds were superglued !",

Finishing treatment (except that it doesn't feel like I have as I am now on tamoxifen) brings it's own stuff doesn't it?  I'm sorry that you had an infection: that's horrible.  I see the surgeon again in April to look at fat grafting as I have some rippling.... So, we are both trying for work this month. Maybe those of us that are at that stage could have a running thread for support? I know that I'd find it useful. I'm nervous about how I'll cope because my chemo brain hasn't really gone yet. I get muddled and forget stuff.... Some kind if dementia maybe?! Nicky x",

I was frightened that I'd get bumped and shoved: in the end I had to go as I needed more laxatives lol! I walked very slowly for ages to avoid my boobs jiggling about but also to avoid being bumped. I didn't venture clothes shopping for 9 weeks I think....and then felt like I'd climbed a mountain afterwards! But you are right: it feels lovely to do normal stuff again.  Tamoxifen: is this your second round Lisa? That's tough....really tough. You are doing incredibly well. Hugs for you xxxx Nicky x",

      "Content": "Hello Barfy , I had double mastectomy with immediate recon with implants in October. I was terrified too but I'm not sure that you can avoid the fear. I will say that I woke up after surgery with the most enormous sense of relief. I was awake for one thing, but really just that it was over with.  My anaesthetist gave me very good pain relief with several nerve blocks, so hopefully that will be the case for you too. But you'll be given good tablet pain relief too. I certainly was not in huge pain post op, so be reassured by that. The drains are a nuisance and are painful of they catch on anything, but you quickly get used to them, oddly! My hospital gave us drain bags that the nursing sister had made: Do you know if you need to get your own or not? A tote bag will work too but the fabric cross body bags were brilliant.  i got a couple of small heart shaped pillows from a lovelt group on Facebook : Jen's Friends. They are handmade and are just brilliant to put under your arm once you are home, either when in bed or sitting out. They are free for a small donation. I still use mine now, and they arrived really quickly in the post. I also got a v pillow which has been a godsend to help with sleeping propped up a bit on your back.  You will get through it . The relief I felt the afternoon I woke up on the ward was immense. Looking down at my chest the following day was ok too....they still look like breasts. Do you have a good bra? I got two aomena bras called Ester that are front opening, amd was advised by my BCN to get them one band size up. The deep soft underhand of this bra doesn't rub on the drain sites. Really good, easy on and off.  Which type of implant are you having? Under or over the muscle?  Nicky x",
