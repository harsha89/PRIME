But as its lobularou houkd get quite. No my kidney issue is not life threatening as it is now but i am VERY allergic/sensitive to all sorts of drugs and would not want to live if I had to have dialysis for ever......which is the most likely outcome if kidney damage occurs as result of chemo I did ask about the Cyclo and was basically just ignored, but what else could I request in its place? I have made one decision and that is I will not let this oncologist anywhere near me-!!! Despite the weather am now thinking of basing myself in the UK.....although I have to say that the Director of the Hospital is supportive and doing everything she can to help",

Literature says most specialists no longer order rads to axilla post MX if there was a total ANC.....well mine has!  He also said very clearly to not use any moisturisers, no aloe gel absolutely nothing on the skin at all.  I am worried about this as I moisturise my skin every day and espeically that area post op.....now just when it is being blasted by rays I am meant to give it less while it gets dried out and the risk of LE is significantly higher.  My skin is very sensitive and already from just one session I have more swelling and can feel discomfort, esp in axilla area....and I am scheduled for at least another 24 sessions....... I bought an aloe vera plant so can I use that as it is definitely pure but will this cause a problem?  Why can´t I nourish my skin at all when Macland and everywhere else says moisturise at least 3 times a day.....? His rationale is that any kind of moisutrising will direct the rays in to the outer levels of skin and create problems whereas they want ti to go in to the inner areas (bearing in mind I only have sin and bone on my MX side, no flesh really at all except under the arm area which has some oedema......)  Rad Onc just says use soap but I never use that as it dries my skin out!!  I don´t want to have to solve a problem, I want to try and avoid one.....and I don´t know what to do now Other question is I have a marker half way down my ribs near belly button - does this mean the rays are going down that low?  I was told I was seeing the doc again today but instead they just put me on the machine and zapped me.....it buzzed when it was working - is that normal?    ",

But also the thought of having to be like this for another 21 months fills me with horror and black hole depression as my prosthetics are not weighted equally (I don´t wear th silicone one as its too uncomfortble and i hate silicone anyway) so I have a constantly sore neck and upper spine area......",

All i can tell you is that you will start to feel better, you never feel like you will but you do, I am 12 weeks along the road from diagnosis now and i am begining to take it a lot more in my stride and feel like I have more balance, I refuse to let little c rule my life....... Our golden rule here is do not google, only trust info from Macmillan or Breastcancercare websites, there si a lto of out of date or inaccurate info out there......if you are interested in integrative approaches then canceractive is a good one to google as their info is reliable. Second rule is we are all here for you to vent and share as much as you like and whatever you want to share....... Sending you a hug...xxx",

Having said that Tinkers sent me a very interesting book and that really does seem to help us to find the answer as to why me (its a different answer for each of us) - its called Cellular Awakening, by Barbara Wren...........its on amazon or Book Depository so look it up and see what you think...... I have been thinking about you as you have been invisible for quite some time and I know how much this has lambasted you, its a horrible horrible process and the treatments are pretty depressing too.....but I am convinced that we can each add to our own future prospects and positive prognosis by working on our own health patterns.....

Also chemo has nothing to do with how aggressive it is, they routinely offer chemo for all cancer that is not DCIS alone, a lot of cancer treatment is over-kill as a lot of it is unknown and unquantifiable, that is what makes it so challenging emotionally.......and chemo is mega expensive so they only offer it to patients whom they anticipate will have longer life span ahead. Clear margins are good, so no need for further surgery and in your case I would imagine radiotherapy is more important than chemo but I am not a doctor. Hormone positive is also good but please phone the UK helpline, they are brilliant",

Hormone positive is good as prognosis is better and also because it offers a whole additional treatment range as it means the cancer needs hormones to grow and so you starve it of them....... Cancer has some very scary words in simple conversations, words like invasive and aggressive are quite bullying type words as they have a physical impact on your body just thinking about them, but they are simply the descriptive terms used and you definitely do not sound aggressive in any way shape or form. My advise is to never make a decision in a state of fear or panic, cancer , even when mega aggressive does not spread like a rash, most cancers have been growing for years, unnoticed, so taking a few days or even a week to get to grips with it and make decisions that are right for you will not make any difference to your prognosis, which I have to say sounds extremely positive...and people on here know I don´t use that word lightly!!!   xxxx",

I used to peg my drains on to my clothes with the little clip they came with so you could not see them and although you think they will hurt they did not unless I caught the tube when turning over for instance, but it is a little difficult showering, I clipped mine to a hanger inside the shower to avoid holding on to them. In terms of things like writing and eating and drinking, other than first 36 hours where there was a lot of pressure bandfage no problems at all....and for me it was only day one when pain from surgery needed more than paracetamol, it was lymph node area that hurt more.... Good luck, it is amazing how you can have such a long scar yet so little pain and discomfort   !!",

I don´t think I would be as calm as you in your circumstances so well done for keeping an even keel!! Sending you big hug...  ",

I really and truly do think you need to go on a living with cancer workshop if you can somewhere as you will lesrn a lot about what you can do for yourself and jsut knowing that will help - did you know that daily exercise for 30 minnutes (once off chemo) increases survival from all kinds of breast cancer by 40 to 55% - that is higher than chemo and easy to do...........see what I mean?  Another BIG H U G............be kind to yourself",

This may be why only 4 sessions is prescribed.  I suppose Herceptin is stated as positive as its another line of attack, strange these oncologists at times aren´t they? It seems like a nice plan to me, as there are checks built in which must be reassuring, and you sound quite happy with it all - do you speak french as well as spanish? Take care, thank you for your support, glad you have peace of mind - so you have 2 weeks to rest first now?   xxx",

I think you are entitled to feel totally sorry for yourself so have a real pity party........and enjoy it as you will feel better afterwards!!  So glad you have a wonderful husband and wishing you a better day tomorrow..

I had two MRI scans (not CT as cannot tolerate contrast) and they showed up various things, some changes in the non cancer breast and elsewhere.  I had further tests and immediately afterwards was told it is NOT cancer but still do not know what it actually is and in many cases people have things show up that are NOT cancer, its one of the downsides of scans so please don´t write yourself off yet!! It does not mean is has to be cancer, arthritis shows up, as does spinal disc problems and until they are read by a specialist technician no one knows exactly what these are...... I would ask lots of questions like What makes you think it might be cancer? What else could it be? What does it mean if it is cancer? Is it a new primary or a secondary? What is the treatment? Why do you want to delay surgery? Bastard disease this and the biggest challenge is a mental one... . ",

THe area where i put aloe gel did actually burn hot a bit more a few hours later and did go red, but then stopped, it felt good at the time though!  I have found a site in the USA where there is special radiotherapy cream developed by radiation oncologists called MIADERM that apparently does not affect the treatment so am going to see if he will let me have that.....I am just tired of battling with medics who are sceptical.  Every time they have not listened to me I have had a reaction as the only way I know about my reactions to other things is because they have happened whereas over here it seems I have to prove it to them - why would anyone want to invent an effect if it was not there? Why do i need to experience it again unnecessarily and in the case of RADS damage to things like connective tissue can be premanent Now Sue a tango in stilletoes strategically placed might be an idea, or even two places........(actually its a dance demo so will be on stage)",

THe area where i put aloe gel did actually burn hot a bit more a few hours later and did go red, but then stopped, it felt good at the time though!  I have found a site in the USA where there is special radiotherapy cream developed by radiation oncologists called MIADERM that apparently does not affect the treatment so am going to see if he will let me have that.....I am just tired of battling with medics who are sceptical.  Every time they have not listened to me I have had a reaction as the only way I know about my reactions to other things is because they have happened whereas over here it seems I have to prove it to them - why would anyone want to invent an effect if it was not there? Why do i need to experience it again unnecessarily and in the case of RADS damage to things like connective tissue can be premanent Now Sue a tango in stilletoes strategically placed might be an idea, or even two places........(actually its a dance demo so will be on stage)",

How did the fund raising go?  I feel like **** today with dread of tomorrow, I am smelly from BO in this heat (no deodorant and there is a limit to how many showers I can have in a day), totally hacked off with everything and have raging toothache too, so looks like a root canal on the way too, and I am really crabby.........I don´t think I am coping very well at all with this and feel more and more of a freak.  No one has replied to my post about symptoms from RADs this early so that must be another thing i am odd about......my ribs are feeling a bit better today so I am sure its connected to RADS, but I just don´t have the energy to be strong and argue my corner with arsey staff although i will have to.  I just want to get on with it get out and move on...... I so recognise this phrase Mary and i am avoiding quite a few of my friends I have to say Sometimes I resent my friends for being well and then feel such a nasty person that I don`t want to go out again. I resent my OH too as he never worries about what he eats, drinks, does not exercise and has NEVER had anything serious, never been in hospital, nothing  - if he has a cold he´s dying mind......

I don´t hate myself, I miss me, I hate how mutilated I am, I hate how I feel physically and I don´t want to learn to live like this, as a mutant, if this is all there is then I want out, I am exhausted by it all, over the last 8 years every time I have got to a point of being ok for a few weeks or even 2 to 3 months something else comes along and whacks me..........my so called partner has no idea how to cope with it so all he says is I am still me to him and he does not care how I look, but that just irritates me as it completely misses how isolated and disconnected I feel. I just need to find the courage to do it that´s all. I simply don´t want to carry on feeling as I do, every day is such hard work, even things you would never think about normally take so much extra emotional effort............. I don´t see anything to look forward to at all, as I don´t really enjoy or feel nourished by anything, and if its feeling like this or the joy of further cancer as the only virtual guarantee if the doctors are to be believed, then just what is the point?  I don´t want a slow further erosion of me being eaten away by rogue cells. I have lost enough of me already. I am sure you all do mean well, but all it does is make me cry, and feel more isolated and abnormal, just nothing changes how I feel, just nothing, I buy clothes to try and feel better but they are not really my style and so I don´t feel like me anyway, so they doný work but I have to buy them anyway as all my other clothes show my chest (not cleavage) and that is all sunken and bony on one side.

I have already been to Penny Brohn and while I was there it was great but coming back here to nothing again is tough, don´t know about anywhere in Devon though? I might be english but I cannot just go back to the UK, I have researched it.  As I have not lived there for so long i am not entitled to any kind of benefits, I do not have a job to go to and cannot find one (I registered with Agencies) and I have nowhere to live when there or money to live on so it is just not viable.  As i am not relocating to the UK i am not entitled to NHS care and UK private plastic surgery is way beyond my means......so there is no point in spending money on a consultation when I would not be able to take it up even if it was positive and right now that could not be as even I can tell no one could do anything with me in the physical state I am in at present. My physio is of the same opinion as the two doctors who have already seen me so I have not been passive. The house here is up for sale but until it sells (probably take years given state of market here) we cannot afford to go anywhere else as the mortgage here still needs to be paid and renting the house out would not cover the mortgage. I thought getting to the end of active treatment would make life easier but I feel loads worse",

Also you got off pretty lightly compared to me so you don´t have a clue how you might have coped if you had been amputated and mutilated do you? Its very easy to sit in comfort of ample resources, fellow real life patients you can meet with and the luxury of lesser treatment and be impatient with others not so fortunate........ Thanks Dorothee - I do know about the grieving process, and I have done a lot of reading on coping, coming to terms etc etc, ad nauseum but I thought I would feel better by now not worse.......and physically i am still feeling worse not better too, and medications don´t help....I think I have been through every stage multiple times, I felt loads better about myself pre rads, not happy but coping better.......it is the rads that have changed things so much ............. I have not been just waiting or being passive, that is the whole point of why I feel so awful as I have worked and processed, exercise, go to physio (which I find humiliating as I have to expose myself)  and tried to come to terms with this and instead I now feel worse than ever, not better, even the fake silicone lump is uncomfortable........so yes I am resentful, there are so many people who are 100% selfish in expat land who do nothing for anyone and just hang out in bars drinking themselves silly and they smoke adn drink all they like and don´t get cancer......whereas I have had illness of one kind or another,  all of which has affected my quality of life for the last 8 years culminating in the final \"gift\" of cancer.......and now forever mutilation (no point in going to the UK for second opinion on surgery, only immigrants who have never paid in to the UK get health care for free and can then jog off again, I won´t unless I move back permanently or go private, can´t do either as live in warm climate as in constant pain if I don´t  and I cannot afford private surgery even if they could do it...)  .  I also spend hours every day working for charity online so I am hardly sitting wallowing, BUT nothing actually helps me to feel ok......and I just dread having to get dressed every day as its jut more upset........ I will keep looking for help but I really don´t see how talking about it is going to make the slightest difference to how I feel about being mutilated.............or the discomfort etc",

      "Content": "Info below from Business Week magazine The next new treatment for breast, colon and prostate cancers, among others, may be a diabetes drug first approved in 1958. Metformin, the most commonly used medicine to lower blood- sugar, is the subject of about 50 cancer studies globally, according to U.S. government clinical trial information compiled by Bloomberg. The research began after scientists found metformin prevented tumors in mice and that diabetics were less likely to develop a malignancy if they were taking the 5 cents- a-day pill than other diabetes medications. The medicine is dispensed about 120 million times annually, according to a 2010 report in the journal Molecular Cancer Therapeutics. If the latest trials on breast and other tumors are successful, the drug could become a cheap weapon in the fight against a myriad of diseases including pancreatic and ovarian cancers. All told, cancer kills one in eight people and is the second-leading cause of death in most developed nations. \u201cThe hope is that if it does show safety and efficacy, it would be available in a cost-effective way,\u201d said Chandini Portteus, vice president of research, evaluation and scientific programs at Susan G. Komen for the Cure, a Dallas-based breast cancer advocacy group. \u201cIt would be wonderful for patients if we had something that we knew worked and was safe and low- cost.\u201d The organization has spent about $10 million investigating metformin for breast cancer, Portteus said. \u201cWe have to turn over every single rock to determine what the options are for patients who need them.\u201d Millions of Deaths Global cancer deaths will climb to 13.1 million by 2030 from 7.6 million in 2008, the Geneva-based World Health Organization said in February. Cancer costs totaled $124.6 billion in the U.S. alone in 2010, according to the National Cancer Institute. Newer, more targeted drug therapies, such as Dendreon Corp. (DNDN)\u2019s $93,000-a-year Provenge for prostate cancer, may add only a few months of life. Metformin was the seventh most-dispensed medicine in the U.S. in 2011, according to a list published by IMS Institute for Healthcare Informatics in April that ranked a group of painkillers that includes Vicodin as the most-prescribed. A pack of 84 500-milligram tablets of the diabetes pill, taken twice daily, costs the U.K.\u2019s National Health Service 1.37 pounds, or the equivalent of about 3 pence (5 U.S. cents) a day. The MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston is studying metformin in at least eight trials, according to a National Institutes of Health online database. \u2018Safe and Cheap\u2019 \u201cIt is safe and it is cheap,\u201d said Donghui Li, an epidemiologist and professor of medicine at the center. \u201cIt reduces the risk and has better survival\u201d in studies she\u2019s done in pancreatic cancer patients. Patients who had taken metformin had a 60 percent lower risk of developing pancreatic cancer, according to a case- control study Li published in 2009 in which she compared cancer patients taking metformin against people not on metformin. Metformin didn\u2019t benefit patients whose pancreatic cancer had already spread to other tissues, Li reported this year in the journal Clinical Cancer Research. Those patients whose malignancies were confined to the pancreas survived longer if they were on metformin -- an average of 15 months, or four months more than patients not taking the drug, she found. More research is needed to confirm those benefits in patients as their disease is developing, Li said. \u201cI got a lot of calls from patients and other clinicians, but I told them I cannot give them a recommendation,\u201d she said. Insulin Levels Lewis Cantley, director of the Cancer Center at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, a hospital affiliated with Harvard Medical School, does have a suggestion for doctors who diagnose and treat diabetics: Test patients\u2019 insulin levels in addition to blood sugar. People whose insulin levels are high should either take metformin or increase their exercise and control their diets by reducing the amount of carbohydrates eaten, Cantley said. \u201cThat will have a huge impact in preventing you from getting cancer,\u201d said Cantley, who trained as a biochemist and biophysicist, in an interview. \u201cIt may even slow down the growth of the cancer you already have.\u201d",

Since red wine is now meant to increase survival chances by 10% I am r ducing my risk with a glass of vino to cope!!!!  But its a serious question......

      "Content": "Hi Jojo, the evidence regarding red wine is mixed but a recent long term study showed that people with or who had had breast cancer and who have a glass of red wine 5 times per week actually improve their survival chances .......other studies also show that resvertarol (high levels in red wine and red grape juice) improve immune function.....and for me I think I need to weigh up having an enjoyable life or a life of austerity which would probably only just feel longer!!  Seriously though I think everyone is different, I have a blood vessel disease too so red wine is good for that and I don´t drink spirits.....as they are very high in sugar, also drink red wine with a meal rather than alone then the sugar does not give a boost to your blood sugar levels so cancer cells cannot access it in the same way - Rainbow Diet also suggests this....... I am getting more distressed by being lop sided, not less as time goes on, and really don´t know what to do with myself.......but it is plain I will not get the recon surgery I need / want on the NHS here as they will only do the lat dorsi and that is no good for me.....

I don´t live in UK so no one to talk to unless I pay for it and that really won´t change anything, I just want to know I can look semi normal again and stop feeling like this ugly freak......I just don´t feel like me any more and hate being reminded of cancer every day, I know I had it, I have dealt with that, I know the risks of recurrence but am making changes in my life to minimise chance of those.....but I hate the twice daily, at least, unavoidable reminders....... I really am at a loss to know how to move forward on this, will try meditation soon......",

Cancer is NOT my life and it is NOT going to be, end of..... Are you feeling more positive - why should you when you are in shock? Again this is her need not yours.  I also confused pity with caring and realised I find being cared about difficult......scary to let it in in case I get hurt if they diappear....old insecurities surfacing there......actually my friends have been incredible, more supportive than I ever imagined and from a position of caring not pity........and they don´t do it to make me feel strong jsut because they want to be there and as one said to me, becaue thery all know it could have happened to any one of them......... I too, still, find it hard to think of myself as cancer and me together, in fact I am actively trying not to.......yes I had cancer (all surgically removed as far as I know) - everything else is speculation and guess work as to whether it is still there......so i am ME fighting an attack on my immune system and integrity...(maybe some on here will thinnk i am in denial but the whole cancer industry is big business at the end of the day, loads of profit in it and drug companies and health services are hand in glove) - yes cynical again Thinking of you and you have the right to feel however you feel......it is others who need you to be positive, I certainly don´t I jsut want you to feel supported and cared for by thoseof us who REALLY know the HELL you are feeling.....

He told me he would see me on day of first one, but he was not there and I was not scheduled for an appt with him, I have not even handed in the consent form yet!!  No one has bothered to check even that...... The woman today showed the doctor on duty my aloe gel and also asked about aloe plant and reply was no use nothing, aloe will make my skin burn according to them..........never mind that I am already really quite sore, and you can feel the heat.  They will not offer anything even though he said at first appt there were 3 creams it was ok to use.  I have a mark low down on my bottom rib and support line yesterday said they often go down that far, well I hurt all along the bottom rib today and have been sore after both sessions so far, when I thought it was not supposed to have any effect for ages, I am ok without clothes on top but not to wear clothes and now my bottom rib hurts all the time..........clothed or not. Can you text me the names and strengths of the creams they say are ok please?  We are both in Andalucia so I can´t see that the protocol will be different and I am really not comfortable at all. I did not mind male staff for other things but this just feels too personal and the radiotherapy unit is for all kinds of patients not just bc ones so they could just be a bit thoughtful, I bet they take care of muslim women and don´t let a man see or treat them. Thanks for offer to talk but I am still in tears even thinking about it so can´t really talk. I feel such a wuss but it really has upset me so much.",

In this case I am not sure what it would achieve as if they are an equal opportunity hospital nothing will change - i have decided I will take in a cloth to cover my remaining breast with for privacy - as they are not radiating that and the dot on the side will still bed visible they cannot object.  I am also going to insist on speaking to the doctor before the next treatment as I don´t think its right that 3 of my ribs should be sore this fast....and I have a high pain threshold.........I anticipate a battle but will try and get the doctor to agree this before - I checked the Marsden site for Rads and even they say the jury is still out on moisturising or not.............. Apart from my ribs and under arm I feel better today so it is definitely the rads that is stirring it up and making me sore even though it is not supposed to happen . If I don´t get satisfaction I may well complain to the Hospital Director, I do have a trump card as have not even signed the consent form for Rads yet as they did not keep their protocol and give me a second appointment with the doctor (which he said would happen) before doing the first one. Thing is I don´t really want it to be like this, I just want care and kindness and help with my skin and symptoms and some reassurance I feel like I am getting boring on this forum especially as others are having worse things.....",

Well after yesterday I thought to myself oh good I can manage radiotherapy just fine and went off there on my own again this morning quite happily - well how wrong was I........... Man came out and called me in then walked in to the treatment room.  I started to panic and asked one of the women from yesterday if it was not a women only treatment and she said oh no.  I did not want to let my robe go and she snatched it away and I was then man-handled by this man in to position on my good side and forced to be totally exposed to him for the whole session.  After a minute or two i just started sobbing and tried to hold my breath as was worried rays would not get to correct place.  I literally sobbed my heart out all the time, it just felt like one thing too much. At the end they came out and barked at me \"what´s wrong\" and I said it was humiliating and embarassing in front of a man as my husband did not even get to see me - what was her response?  A lecture and speech on how \"we are an equal hospital and all professionals, your doctor has seen you\" In between sobs I pointed out he was not staring at me with my arms above my head for over 10 minutes so it was different, and that I hated the way I looked and she clearly did not understand - well she said she did and then  I got the we are professional lecture again and at no point was anyone kind or understanding or gave me any softness at ll.  I asked about aloe gel or aloe direct from a plant so for sure nothing else and said that I was already sore and did not want to get worse, not good with soap etc - response?  Doctor says soap and water only.......NOTHING ELSE.......oh right thanks for listening, thanks for understanding, thanks for caring.-I´ll just wait for a crisis like your ***** government does before acting then shall I?It just seems cruel that I am sore and more than uncomfortable yet not allowed to do anything to soothe it - I normally moisturise every day as well so its a double  whammy.... I sat in the dressing room for ages and just sobbed before I could even go out, cried in the car, went for a walk top try and calm down before coming back but still drove home over an hour with tears rolling down my face, I could not stop them, a good facial.  Had to take my bra off straight away as too sore, and even OH can tell how hot that side is.......and I just feel hopeless now with nowhere to turn.  I thought you were not supposed to get sore straight away?  Maybe I am just too sensitive, I even got to thinking maybe I am too sensitive for this world as everything seems to hurt me at the moment, I feel really fragile and on top of it all I have a new lump that has appeared since starting rads, was not there before...... How do any of you manage with male technicians - if I had two breasts it would be ok but being seen as I am just crucifies me inside and I could not hold it in today....... I have decided I will try and make myself go for the minimum of 15 sessions (even though my TP says 25) as I don´t think I will get to 25 if I am already this uncomfortable on ribs as well as skin etc",

If you want to add me as a friend or send me private message happy to correspond with you as it takes time and i never thought it would be ok For my MX scar I am using rose hip oil and that is making a big difference to it and it is healing well and fast, helps with swelling too, not sure how so you may want to try that.   xxx",

      "Content": "Poor you - I found this for you shelley from a reputable site........ Abraxane uses albumin, which is a human protein, in conjunction with pacitaxel to deliver the treatment to the cancerous cells. It is easier to do this when albumin is used because there are receptors for this protein on the surface of the cells of the tumors. This makes it easier for the molecules of the drug to bind with them and start to work effectively. Inside the tumor, there is a protein called SPARC that supplied the tumor with the nutrients it needs to grow. When Abraxane bonds with the cells, it cuts off this supply of nutrients. There are no chemical solvents in Abraxane, which means that patients do not need to take a regimen of medication before receiving treatment to combat the effects of the chemicals on the body. This drug has been approved for use in the treatment of breast cancer in almost all countries of the world.",

I detect on here a huge pro chemo attitude and while I can understand that given the nature of the forum etc I am also sensing an under current that seems critical of me.  Maybe i am being over sensitive but I have always been honest on here and it is really affecting me.  My decision was not an easy one to make and it has its challenges too.  But I do have to be honest and declare that I do think there are other good treatments available that may not have passed clinical trials (some of them it is impossible to do this for due to their nature) that can be useful as an adjunct or alternative to the standard treatments.  I don´t mean snake oil type ones but ones with solid good well run observational studies behind them. I hope no one has perceived my mentioning them on here as peddling them as that is not my intention but it took me a lot of research to find my treatment option and I hoped it might help someone else who may have mixed thoughts.     .",

We all have different life situations, cancers, experiences, resources etc etc........to lump everyone together as cancer patient - be positive = get well is far too simplistic.  ALL the books I have read on dealing with cancer and the psychological impact of it say there is absolutely NO evidence whatsoever that being positive makes any difference to prognosis or outcome......and my take on it is that making yourself be positive as well as deal with cancer and all that goes with it is an unnecessary extra stress, adjusting to cancer is a process, not a minute or an hour, or a week or a month, and processes have ups and downs just like the tides in the sea. There is a grief cycle to go through and as you go through it the ebbs and flows get farther apart......There IS evidence that stress makes people more prone to cancer - and I think the pressure to be positive is more an expression of the needs of others rather than an essential to regaining health!  So after that long meander, my message is to say feel what you are feeling, don´t judge yourself but be kind instead.........I am glad you came on here to tell us and now feel a bit supported... xx.",

      "Content": "Sorry if this is getting boring but I am still researching and considering effectiveness of chemo for lobular cancer. Many kosher sites report it does not respond that well to chemo and also of course grade 1 cells also respond less well to chemo as they are slower growing.  I also see many report of people left with heart problems and other permanent effects resulting from chemo.  People with other health conditions or mitral valve issues in the heart also seem more vulnerable to long term chemo damage.... Has anyone else heard this? Can anyone recommend a particular centre of excellence or brilliant Oncologist for lobular cancer? Please don´t say just accept everything without question as I do have loads of reservations due to my significantly higher risk of complications",

      "Content": "Indole 3 Carbinol has been shown to block oestrogen receptors and it is also a fact that some of the major drug companies are looking to find a way to extract the active ingredient so they can patent it and make money from it, but in its current state it is not patentable, so no money in it!!! They miss the point that it may not work then as it is natural so may need its co factors! I3C bas not been clinically tested in same way Tamoxifen has BUT it has been proved to do the same job as it.  I have it in the cupboard all ready to take, but I decided to try Letrozole first as I am so hormone positive and I refused chemo and it is really important for me.  So far it has really not been so bad only the hot flushes, don´t know about other effects, deliberately did not read them. My guess is that you may get some of the lesser side effects from it like hot flushes....... Why not contact a medically trained doctor who is also interested in working with an integrative approach to cancer and talk it through with them?  This is a decision only you can make but in your shoes where it was not a must I think I would be inclined to try the natural approach first, but only if you are willing to accept that you may then end up forever blaming yourself if the cancer comes back or you get another one, but then that could happen with Tamoxifen anyway.....so really its a case of listen to yourself adn make the decision you feel happiest with and that fits you the best.... Good luck, i know very well how difficult it is to go against the mainstream xxx. ",

We all have different life situations, cancers, experiences, resources etc etc........to lump everyone together as cancer patient - be positive = get well is far too simplistic.  ALL the books I have read on dealing with cancer and the psychological impact of it say there is absolutely NO evidence whatsoever that being positive makes any difference to prognosis or outcome......and my take on it is that making yourself be positive as well as deal with cancer and all that goes with it is an unnecessary extra stress, adjusting to cancer is a process, not a minute or an hour, or a week or a month, and processes have ups and downs just like the tides in the sea. There is a grief cycle to go through and as you go through it the ebbs and flows get farther apart......There IS evidence that stress makes people more prone to cancer - and I think the pressure to be positive is more an expression of the needs of others rather than an essential to regaining health!  So after that long meander, my message is to say feel what you are feeling, don´t judge yourself but be kind instead.........I am glad you came on here to tell us and now feel a bit supported... xx.",

I looked at some photos on my camera today and saw that I had taken photos of my chest pre surgery, was shocked to see how saggy my breasts really were, one is, and realised that I had probably romanticised how lovely they were in my head and memory and gone back to much younger years!!!  so now I need to remind myself of that too..   xxx",

Despite your panic and fear now cancer does not grow that fast so take your time to make decisions, its easy to get stuck on the speedy train that is fuelled by fear and making decisions based on fear are probably not the best decisions you will ever make....so remember a few days or even weeks will not make an enormous difference to your health...

Not trying to scare you but just to inform My advice - get yourself a second opinion from another Oncology team asap and then make a decision.....or possibly another team AND an integrative doctor (who can tell you the best from all fields and not just the conventional) Radiotherapy pre surgery is not advised as radiation damages tissue and causes problematic or delayed healing I did not follow the traditional treatment route either but is it possible your response may be a knee jerk reaction to the shock?    Good luck",

I am really struggling emotionally at moment more than before re living rest of my life like this as I just cannot adjust to it yet I am not depressed in general, just about this, I even think maybe it would be good if cancer got me sooner rather than later as it would be less time living feeling like this , how ridiculous and pathetic and counter to my own beliefs is that but its there............every day I think that at least once and I hate myself for being so pathetic - I don´t see the point in counselling as that won´t change how different I feel all the time - its  1kg weight difference for me from one side to the other, and that anyone will notice........hold a 2 litre water bottle to your chest on one side and you can see what the difference is, so I can never forget about it, even when wearing a pros.  Sorry I am as bored with this as you must all be.....",

No vascular invasion  I am posting this to update Team SR who have been the most amazing support but more importantly to show just how different pathology can be so its always worth asking for a second opinion and / or pathology review",

I have seen photos of myself from them and you cannot see......and remember none of us actually have identical breasts on both sides anyway. Since my mastectomy I have been ultra self conscious about how lop sided I am but in fact no one HAS noticed at all and beleive me I have watched facesand even seen peoplewho DO know look but try not to!!!   I only use a sock inside a soft padded bra with a padded cup on it so both sides look the same on the outside......truly no one noticed and I realised that when one man said ok gorgeous to me in the same way as he would with a two boobed woman...such a silly little thing and he was a total stranger but it meant everything...!!!!  So I am not sure it as noticeable as you think BUT for you it will be as this c is constantly there at the back of your mind, it is for all of us but you will get better, I know that a few weeks down the line I DO have more times when I forget about this and I never believed others when the said that adn I areally am lopsided with no recon possible yet, if ever........ Lets make a pact to \"speak\" on Thursday or WEd evening as we both see the Onc this week, I need to puosh mine to let me have a CT scan.......and it really is better to know than not know.... Oh one other thing, I had huge area of changed breast skin also, they did pathology on this and it was totally benign, just a different texture due to the tumour underneath so the thing to remmeber with this is you really don´t know the facts until they do a biopsy/pathology, there is no other way of knowing for sure. For me it is one of the hardest things about this as I feel so powerless to tell for myself but this is my experience....... Thinking of you.....sending a hug..xx",

I have an officially rare condition (on the world Register of Rare disorders) which cost me one kidney and is not well understood.  I nearly lost my remaining kidney to the same disorder a few years ago -  and even finding a suitable Specialist with experience of my condition is difficult. I am going mad as I am getting different medical opinions regarding whether chemotherapy (adjuvant as am post MX and ANC now) is right for me.....one Onc and surgeon say chemo is a definite must as I am Stage 3 with 7 affected nodes.  Another one says I am high risk of kidney damage and other complications due to kidney status and other drug sensitivities/allergies......another doctor says everyone who has not had chemo has developed more cancer so this is inevitable..all of these are from the same hospital, I have not taken a second opinion elsewhere yet but am just getting more confused and more stressed. Does anyone have any experience of having chemo with just one kidney and if so how was it managed?  Did you have tablet form or IV? Was the drug combination different? Did you have it weekly instead of every 3 weeks, etc etc........ I know these are questions to ask an Oncologist but my appt last week was awful and she did not have a single answer to any of my questions.......I am hoping the regular Oncologist will be better but not holding my breath right now. Feeling really very depressed about it all and the lack of any clear or detailed treatment plan. If you prefer to send a private message please do!    ",

I was told the same thing as you re lump size etc and how it significant and with something as significant as this.......it really is not helpful of doctors to say that.  sometimes I wonder if they do that to try and get a more compliant patient by scaring them silly!  I know you say you don´t like a lot of info but I wonder if you may feel better if you did have some more info re your type of cancer or if they suspect it is IBC (it may not be, my breast and underarm area were really swollen, so much so they could not d o a mammogram and I had to take antibiotics and ice to reduce it down, mine was NOT IBC).  I do believe good knowledge (ie from a reputable source like a medical or science research insitution) IS power. I know this probably is not helping you at all as you think its not the same as me, but remember this doctor is one human being with some extrs training, that does not make him a good communicator or necessarily user friendly as a doctor.....and you can ask for a second opinion.......I think you might benefit from talking to a breast cancer nurse and asking her some wuestions - also you might like to look on here for info on scans.....

      "Content": "This is an extract from info on About Breast Cancer which is accurate - don´t get too worried about it as some countries do it as standard tests.....but it also seems to vary according to which actual pice of tissue was studied - I had one which was 90% (ie MEGA high) and another one which was 20%.....one heck of a difference yet same cancer and same breast............ Copied and pasted info   The researchers agreed that high levels of Ki-67 indicate an aggressive tumor and predict a poor prognosis. A British study found that breast cancers could vary in regards to hormone-sensitivity, lymph node status (positive or negative), but if the tumor tested positive with high levels of Ki-67, the risk of recurrence was higher than average. Do I Need The Ki-67 Tumor Marker Test? If your cancer appears to be aggressive, your doctor may order this test to see if Ki-67 is affecting your tumor growth. Other tests must also be done for hormone receptors, HER2 - neu and metastasis, and these results, along with your Ki-67 Labeling Index (test score) will affect your treatment plan. Benefits of The Ki-67 Tumor Marker Test A breast tumor that scores high for Ki-67 is made of cells that are rapidly dividing and growing. Chemotherapy drugs target cells that are growing beyond the normal rate, and so these drugs can be effective on aggressive cancers. Knowing your Ki-67 score helps you and your doctor decide what treatment will work best for you. Balancing Prognosis With Your Response to Treatment A study in the Journal of Clinical Oncology found that tumors that had higher levels of Ki-67 had a good response to chemotherapy. This study noted that a high index of Ki-67 usually means a poor prognosis (shorter survival), but if the cancer responds particularly well to appropriate chemotherapy, long-term survival is achievable. They also speculate that if the Ki-67 test were done according to consistent standards, the results of a Ki-67 test might be helpful in determining whether or not neoadjuvant chemotherapy (given before surgery) would be effective for some tumors.",

I HATE being lop sided, was getting used to it and could even forget about it sometimes but then had RADS and the constant pain, discomfort, swelling since then means I can never forget I am mutilated, and that is what it is to me, a mutilation.  I am very much in the (unwanted) minority here as everyone else seems determined to be positive but I cringe at myself every single day, especially getting dressed and undressed.  I hide in my own bedroom when getting changed as I do not want people to know I am now deformed etc etc.......I was not in love with my breasts as they were large and a bit droopy but now have only one and a mess on the other side, lumps and bumps, and creases etc and swollen flesh.  I avoid going to the doctor as I cannot bear being seen by any medical staff, I can relax only with the surgeon who did the surgery. As a result of my surgery I have had to change my wardrobe as even though I was not a big low cut cleavage exposer I did wear tops that are no longer any good as if I lean forward they gape and my mutilation is there for all to see..... Yes I know I can look good in clothes but underneath I know I am not so I feel a fraud! Its not about how I look in vanity type terms, its about symmetry and feeling balanced but motst of all being and feeling normal which I am not with one side missing....... Rusty wrote that c messes with your head well I feel well and truly messed up - apparently I SHOULD feel grateful to be alive, BUT its not my life anymore its a different one that I don´t want trying to live in a body that repels me.  I tried counselling and it was a total waste of time - 3 sessions just irritated the hell out of me and did not help Maybe I shjould jsut be Mrs angry on here, I feel isolated even here as everyone else seems so positive yet now I´ve reached this far in my post I am in tears again..........  ",

Lung cancer is one of the more difficult to treat cancers..... I had shoulder pain and neck pain and lumps, even immediately post surgery, but they are not cancer, still there but not cancer, I also had symptoms of colon cancer but had tests and it is not, don´t know what it is yet but cancer ruled out...... Chemo kills all cells (its why you feel so bad) so whatever your lump is will be affected by chemo but it does not mean its cancer..........two of my lumps have gone to almost nothing now and I refused chemo........I also had several nodes affected and was stage 3 cancer....... Don´t know if I am being much help but wanted you to feel less alone...maybe a call to the Mac Nurses on helpline here might help as they will hjave more facts etc than me ?  xxx",

I know people who were very high risk, surgery did not get all the tumour out first time round and they had the works, 5 years on, alive, well, smoking (!) and cancer free.......... Sorry but I too am blazing mad at her arrogance as it is not as cut and dried as that and telling you this could make i a self fulfilling prophecy........ . SOME breast cancer may be more likely to return before 5 years but others aren´t - look at Olivia Newton John, how long ago was her cancer?  It is definitely NOT true that bc definitely returns at 2 to 5 year intervals...... My advice is do what you most want to do right now........and please remember you are NOT in need of palliative treatment at the moment and may not be for 10 to 15 years as by the time you get to year 5 there will be new treatments etc etc....... There is so much info and evidence out there about the impact of thoughts and belief on health, don´t let her rather gloomy outlook affect you, live your life and trust in how you feel.....you are giving this woman (and she is only a fallible human being with medical training nothing more than that, not a mega psychic etc...) far too much power............. I was given two lots of statistics by different oncologists, both well regarded, one said 30% chance surviving 5 years the other one said 50%, that alone is 66% difference and with treatment I don´t think either will be true.....prove her wrong and send her a card as you hit each anniversary - yah boo sucks to you, I made it.......   Take care xxxx",

I had sono photodynamic therapy as an alternative to chemo.  It has not had clinical trials done as its almost impossible to do them for that, but it is a long established treatment, is used extensively in China and has some very positive and good observational studies all of which showed that there was a positive benefit.  If you would like to know more or find out how to contact the UK centre where I had my treatment (run and managed by two fully qualified medical doctors) then do send me a private message...",

      "Content": "Thank you both - they would not let me have an immediate recon or expanders which I wanted as they said rads would destroy it and that I had to wait, now rads has destroyed the chest and clavicular area so its most likely not possible either, as they did such a  strong dose over such an extensive area apparently,  I do feel conned.....at no time was I ever told that rads could cause permanent tissue damage or pain or rib problems or all the issues and discomfort I am now living with......or that recom may not be possible post rads.  And the surgeon was clearly far from happy with how burnt I am (not on the surface but the tissue underneath)  so I am not sure if the UK would say anything different as tissue damage like this means higher risk of rejection and necrosis and I already have extensive fibrosis which makes necrosis more likely.......what I don´t udnerstand is that people who have rads post recom don´t seems to have anywhere near the same amount of problems and discomfort post rads......... I hate being lop sided, I am large breasted so it is very noticeable.......and I hate prosthetics and all the restrictions there are in trying to live a normal life as a freak. ",

So sorry you are having such a hard time and you are right cancer does ruin everything and it makes me mad and despairing all at the same time.  I am so jealous of those who had immediate recon or only lumpectomy, and then I feel mean as its so hard for everyone.... Don´t feel like i am cheering you up or have anything to add but I send you a big hug....xx",

I have a raging tooth infection and on really strong antibiotics, only just started to feel bit better today so i am sure the infection is not helping you either...... I am missing my right breast at the moment so we can be twins, but I bet that is no comfort to you at the moment!!!.  Hope all goes well tomorrow and you know where we all are........ xxxxx",

      "Content": "Hi Bobby, I felt like you too and my cancer was diagnosed late as its a lurking type (invasive lobular) - in lymph nodes too but I have had lung, stomach, liver, and bone scan and all were fine (bone scan only results from technician but no evidence its in bones he said so thats good enough for me!)  I have family history too,my GRan had one breast only for 30 odd years, no other teatment, died in late 70's of something unrelated, mum had it too, died of stroke age 80...etc - see where I am going?  Its HORRIBLE AND TERRIFYING where you are, I felt te same as you too, but now I truly do believe and appreciate that everyone's cancer is individual and unique so statistics are useless and always 5 years out of date anyway as they have to be by definition!   We all have low days and better days and days when we don't even think of c (I never believed that was possible)  but there is always someone here to \"talk\" to and we are a great supportive crowd, all belonging to the club no one wants to join..xxxxx",

Good luck for surgery tomorrow, that really will be a breeze compared to your first surgery, and come on and let usnknow how you are when you feel ready - if you want to send me a private emssage before feel free, I REALLY will understand!! xxx",
