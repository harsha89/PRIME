The not knowing and the fear of the unknown is the worst part of this wretched business. Best of luck with your op, get as much help in place as you can before hand and just stage it a stage at a time if we look at the big picture it is too much to process. Each day is different so just face them as they arrive x",

      "Content": "Sounds like if you were ok with chemo you will find that the operation will be fine too. Just be aware though that there is the infection risk. Most people are fine though and I was back to relatively normal life within about 4-5 days. I made a slow start to the day but I still managed to do the washing and ironing and was washing windows by day 4. There is nothing like being told that you can't do things to make you want to do them! Mine was on my left side and I am right handed so that has helped. I am a month on now and fine. The worst part for me has been sleeping positions, I used a V pillow for a couple of weeks, and the nerve pain from the node removal which feels like burning or chafing, but that has eased a lot now. I went back to driving after 2 weeks but could probably have done it earlier and went back to work after a week but I only work 16 hours a week. Good luck, I hope it goes well.",

We are a very open and close knit family so although it has been emotional I feel that we have got the balance right and that they feel part of what is going on. I felt that this was important because ED left home in February and DS has just gone back to uni 400 miles away and we won't see each other again until Christmas and YD is off to uni for the first time on Sunday. She will find this hard but fortunately she is only 40 miles away with good travel links as is ED. It is DS who will possibly struggle the most because he internalises and the distance is tough. It is an emotional time for all of us because my dad has just had cancer treatment too and my MIL is very ill with serious heart failure and may not live for much longer so we just need to pull together as much as we can. Be guided by how you are normally as a family, teenagers like to feel that they have some control and input in their lives so I would be inclined to trust them and be open, they will be able to help you and will appreciate being needed. Best wishes for your treatment x",

A similar thing happened to me when I went for my results having got the impression that if I had clear margins and no node involvement it would be radiotherapy and then tablets for 5-10 years. I was told everything had gone well surgically and I had no node involvement but the tumour was HER2+ and that I would needs chemo rads a year of Herceptin. We felt like we had been slapped when we came out!  As time goes on and you get a full clear treatment plan it will be easier for you to get your head around. I\u2019ve just had round 1 if chemo and have felt dog rough for 3 days but  hoping that I have turned a corner today.

      "Content": "I couldn't agree more. I am newly diagnosed and have so far just had lumpectomy, no idea if chemo is going to be part of my treatment plan yet but if it is and I lose my hair then I will deal with that in my own way. I feel that rather than people doing this as a fundraiser some people will be doing it because it makes people think that maybe they have cancer and they might get special treatment. Even if they are not doing that consciously it is making them feel better in some way. If you are going to donate to charity just donate your money if you have it or your time if you do not. I can understand it more when close friends or family members shave their hair in the hope that their loved one will feel less different but a mass shave seems facile at best. As others have said it would be more meaningful if the hair was then used to make wigs. The day after my diagnosis, I was in M&S looking for a comfortable bra for after my lumpectomy but before I went upstairs I had a wander around the shoe department and came round a corner and bumped into a lady wearing a head scarf and it brought me up short because I suddenly had a reality check of what might happen to me. I then felt guilty for feeling like that. Much as I won't want to stand out if that does become part of my future I also don't want to feel like there are other people who are pretending as it were. Having written of of this I know feel that it looks like I want special treatment I don't! This whole situation is an emotional mine field and I think unless you have experienced it in some form, which I am only just stating out with then you just cannot fully understand how people may feel. I also hate that if you have looked up anything to do with cancer all of your Facebook etc pop up with adverts for cancer charities, I don't want to be reminded at every turn that I have cancer and ore diagnosis that I might have cancer!",

My dad finished chemo and radiotherapy for Oesophageal cancer at the end of May and then spent most of June in hospital being treated for pulmonary embolism. He is still breathless as a result of this and anemia. He is on dabigatran as a blood thinner and is losing hope of ever being well again. He is 75 but has always been very fit and active and is hating his new normal. My mum is so worried about me having chemo in case it has the same affect on me. Hopefully it won't. I am 25 years younger and apart from an under active thyroid I am fit and healthy well apart from having HER2+ breast cancer!",

So far I have been told very little about mine, surgeon was quite reassuring at pre op appointment but she did say that lump was 3cm which is quite sizeable and that she might have to take up to 5cm. I don't think that she took that much because I have been left with a decent shape as far as I can tell, still dressed. I am pretty sure that mine was close to my chest wall, it certainly felt that way which I think is why I hadn't noticed it. I don't get the results from lumpectomy and SNB until 30th and following a week of relative calm, the panic demons are coming back",

      "Content": "Although older than you, I'm 50, I too am HER2+, no node involvement with me, I had lumpectomy first and I am just waiting for first oncology appointment before starting chemo and Herceptin. I have read into this quite a bit over the weekend because I was worried about the potential effects on my heart. My dad had a major heart attack at 60 despite being slim fit and very clean living so I'm worried in case my heart isn't as good as it could be. I have been less clean living and have been a couple of stone overweight for the past 25 years. I have now lost most of that weight and I am fairly fit, I was feeling good about myself until I got my BC diagnosis at the end of July. I will be glad to have my heart health thoroughly checked and I hope to be able to have the Herceptin because the long term outlook is so much better in people who can tolerate it. As far as I can tell any damage caused is reversible over time and certain chemo drugs are far more likely to damage your heart. I will give them my full family history and accept the advice that I am given. I have decided that I can't change what is happening to me but I can read and understand as much as I can and make informed decisions with the help of the medics who treat me. I see no point in losing sleep over the parts that I have no control over. I have also read a lot about fasting before chemo which reduces some of the toxic affects. You fast for 48 hours before and 24 hours afterwards. I am going to speak to my oncologist about this but would like to try.",
