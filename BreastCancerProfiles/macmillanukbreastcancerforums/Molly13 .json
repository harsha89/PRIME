      "Content": "Good luck for tomorrow Annabel, I have had a bone scan and ct scan also my heart was checked. I heard from my oncolaegy nurse this morning I am going in on Friday to see her and talk about my treatment plan and the start chemo on the following Tuesday. I just want to get on with it the sooner we start the sooner we finish. Dorothee,  are you not going to try the cold cap? My oncolgist said not to bother, when i had chemo before it is amazing how soon you get use to having a bald head the only time I covered my head was when I went out. Saw a very brave Lady in Tesco's yesterday with a very bald head but these days it is getting more excepertable   and plus it may be alapesha . Are any of you ladies tired at all everything seems such an effort, and I can not spell at all it has always been bad with my dislexcera  but at the moment its seems ten times worse. Molly 13  ",

      "Content": "Hi Jamsey, This is the time when you find out who your true friends are. As well as having a word to change your day of chemo. In your hospital there should be a office working Macmilion nurse, her job is to help people going through chemo any problems you are having childcare or money worries they are there to help, so try and get in touch with them as soon as possible If you don,t rest and have time to recharge your energy for the next round, this cpould then take longer than it is know and nobody wants that. I really hope they will be able to help you. Hugs to you Molly13 ",
