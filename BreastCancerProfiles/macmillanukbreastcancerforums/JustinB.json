    "Content": "Hello all, I have stage 4 NHLymphoma, low-grade. Last night my wife expressed some concern over my left nipple which reverted around two weeks. I've also had a lot of chest pain beneath my left breast which I've ignored after an ECG showed it isn't my heart. My nipple is also tickles/itches in an uncomfortable way. I guess I'd like to ask you guys if you believe this is cause for worry and needs a visit to my GP? Many thanks for any advice offered, Jai.",
