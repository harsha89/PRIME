      "Content": "Thanks for your reply Mechele and everyone else xx ... my email doesn\u2019t tell me if I get replies so sorry about delay... Wow pop78 that sounds scary! Sounds like you got a good telling off too... it\u2019s so hard knowing if you are doing the right thing sometimes isn\u2019t it... glad you got through that one with a tale to tell. Yes I\u2019m 41 too with a 7 and 9 year old and they are so used to me in and out of hospital that my little trip to A&E didn\u2019t even get an eyebrow raise (lol!) Still got my chesty cough and just finished the oral antibiotics so fingers crossed now... Take care everyone! And if I\u2019m doubt call the hospital/Chemo line Lou xx",

      "Content": "Hi all, Don\u2019t come on here very often as sometimes I want to pretend everything is normal... I\u2019m sure others do the same Well just wondering if anyone else has been \u2018told off\u2019 for not coming to A&E sooner with a temperature? I kind of knew something wasn\u2019t quite right when I had my last Chemo I was coming down with that horrible virus ( that feels like the flu) I spent days shivering unable to regulate temp and having time where I didn\u2019t but feel too bad ( which stopped me going in) The night before I went in my temp got to 38.2 but kept on measuring different values constantly.. it was 1:30am and I was burning up and sweating and worried about ringing for an ambulance... with kids in bed I didn\u2019t want to disturb... so I rang the Chemo hotline in the morning and they said I should have rang up days ago. I felt silly then. The hospital did all the tests and put me on antibiotics drip... my neutrophils were just 1.2 and if they were 1 the hospital would have kept me in (!) So.. sorry about the waffle but please just ring up the hospital if you are not sure ( I know I will now!!)  Anyone been suffering with temperatures or viruses .. how long have you taken to get better? I feel very weak but definitely getting better. Take care, Lou xx",

      "Content": "Hi just a quick question... I am asthmatic and have always had my flu jab each year... It's probably even more important to have it now but I'm not sure about what my oncologist suggested... He told me to get my bloods done and if all ok I have a day to get my flu jab done before my next chemo starts... This all sounds a bit complicated to organise but I'm worried that having some side effects from flu jab will mix with side effects from chemo ( I always have a response to my Docytaxel so I'm normally pumped full of antihistamines...)  Anyone had it done, is it worth it? Thanks, Lou ( had 2 EC and 2 T so far....) X ",
