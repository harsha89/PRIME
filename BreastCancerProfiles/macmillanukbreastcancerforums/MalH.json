      "Content": "after diagnosis in oct 2012 and following wle in november i have just finished my radiotherapy.because some days i feel normal and happy i feel i should be considering returning to part time work only problem is a day later i feel totally whacked,weak tearful,moody and dont think i could manage the hour journey to the office and hour back plus work even for 3-4 hours.i keep thinking im on the mend and four months off work seems a long time but trying to explain to colleagues and friends the ups and downs is too difficult..ive given up trying.just sounds like im one of the weaker ones!! not the person full of positivity that worked thru their rads!!!!! then i feel vulnerable and pathetic.hopeless even.im ok today but just had two horrendously tiring days with me losing my control with family...and shouting..i hope they watch the new tv advert and maybe that will remind people around me that its not all about operations,and trreatment and positivity..its about loss of confidence,energy,joi de vivre.....am i alone with these views.i am trying so hard to get back to my optimistic happy smiling self but im just not able to sustain it.",
