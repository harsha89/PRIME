    "Content": "Hi Lelly, Everyone is different so just see how you go. I had four months chemo which ended in November and apart from 5 days or so after chemo I was really okay. It tends to accumulate so the last couple tend to have more of an effect than the first ones. Of course your scared, it\u2019s the unpredictability that\u2019s difficult. I would suggest being completely open with your new employers, that way they can support you and maybe offer flexible working hours depending how you feel? Just take one week at a time, there are lots of people here to support you. Take care, big hugs Fran",
