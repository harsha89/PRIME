      "Content": "Hi Tinkers, I had a mastectomy and axillary clearance in late Feb. My surgeon didn't put in any drains as he prefers not to (slightly increased risk of infection) and said that the bod copes with the excess fluid by itself anyway. I developed a large seroma where the boob had been and under my arm, about the size (and sound) of a hot-water bottle. In the end I did have it drained 3 times. 350mls the first time 650mls the second time and 300mls the third time, only because it got very uncomfortable and tight. After that it settled down and started to disperse. I do still have a tiny bit of fluid, I can feel it if I squish it about, but its nearly gone.  Having the fluid drained only takes minutes and was no problem as I was still (and still am) numb round the site. It was quite funny really (as so many things are around this) it looks like nothing so much as a half pint of beer! I don't know what I expected! Cheers! Jules",

      "Content": "Hi Sancha Rose, Not me, I have just had a mastectomy and all the usual stuff that happens today.......halfway through chemo etc. BUT, I have a dear friend who had a mastectomy 20 years ago and no chemo or anything else and is still absolutely fine. She's as fit as a fiddle and leading a very normal life, I'm not sure if she was hormone positive, maybe they didn't even know about that in those days. Jules  ",
