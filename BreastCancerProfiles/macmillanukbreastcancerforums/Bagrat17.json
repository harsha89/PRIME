      "Content": "Pleased you have found C/T reassuring Nikki. It's such a lot to process and take in. I know you may feel you want treatment to start ASAP . I keep thinking these rogue cells that have stopped dividing according to plan and got a bit overactive are still part of us but I understand that you would  really like to know they are gone!!  I'm sure the doctors have good research based reasons for the plan of treatment they have tailored to your needs, chosen because it is the best for YOU. Since a previous health blip ( not cancer) I have become a fan of mindfulness and meditation. Lots to choose from and helps me stay calmer than I would otherwise. We are not  patient patients are we? best wishes xx",

      "Content": " chaffinch I just hate headaches. Used to get migraines but they stopped with the menopause. I think the info saying back to work in 2 weeks etc are very misleading as everyone is different. My lumpectomy was 2 weeks today and still tired sometimes, fine others. Results tomorrow so today very weird!! Unfortunately other meds mean I can't take ibuprofen. Hope daughter's  results as you both wish.xx",

      "Content": "Hi Guys, Can I join too?  Microcalcification found on routine mammogram, biopsies 6th July. Results 18th July ,Grade 2 DCIS . Had wide local excision 3rd August. back for full results on Friday. Quite apprehensive as I know other things can pop up sometimes. Also was told i wouldn't need R/T then when i saw surgeon he said I may well ,but he wasn't the surgeon who did op as she was on hols the week before my surgery and she said no point in saying anything till full results which sounded very sensible",

      "Content": "Linsw I am really upset on your behalf and that of others who have posted similarly.  As a retired nurse I could weep for the state of the NHS sometimes. Every hour of worry seems to last a day doesn't  it? I had a different experience and now feel guilty.  Got results 18th July , 20th July seen by surgeon and pre op assessment same day as I live 25 miles from hosp and had WLE 3rd August. Now waiting for results tomorrow.  I too would have gone privately although  have always stuck to tbe NHS in tbe past.  I am so sorry you have this delay to cope with. Sending positive thoughts.",

      "Content": "Tallantire, everyone is different. If you feel you need space to prepare then stopping work may be a good decision for you. I understand the being strong for everyone else but I am learning to be a little bit selfish ( not often enough though). I think you are allowed a melt down every so often. Give yourself a day off and be as grumpy and upset as you would like to be. It is an excellent safety valve. I have played how I really feel down and then grumped because my son hasn't even asked how I am after lumpectomy. Because I am older(73) and as far as I know till later today have DCIS, I feel a fraud even posting when I read the journeys of you youngsters. I do believe there are positives in any situation but sometimes finding them is a teensy bit challenging!! Take care of YOU .  Learning to live with a diagnosis like this can be exhausting so be kind to yourself . Xx",
