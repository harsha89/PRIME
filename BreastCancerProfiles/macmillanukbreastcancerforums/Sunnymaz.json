      "Content": "Hi Sam, I'm new on here too (this is my first post). I'm 55 and had a routine mammogram end of June then went on holiday for 2 weeks and came home to a letter requesting me to have more tests on 21st July; on 28th July I was diagnosed with invasive breast cancer. I'd not felt any lump or anything, I was well in myself and had just taken up learning to run. it was a complete and utter shock and something I'm still trying to get my head round. My cancer was invasive ductal, grade 2 and HER2 negative. On 11th August I ran my first 5K and then on the 14th had a WLE and sentinel node biopsy; I was terrified of what to expect but two weeks later I was relieved to be told that I had clear margins and nodes. I'm now taking Letrozole and waiting for my radiotherapy plan, I see the oncologist on Thursday this week but other than knowing I'll have 15 sessions I have no idea what to expect. My scars are neat and faint, and even though I'm still a bit tender the healing is going well. Best advice I got was to buy some post operative bras for comfort, M&S have a great range and they are so comfy you can even sleep in them, which I've found has been a necessity even though I've only got relatively small boobs!  I am very positive about the outcome as all the signs are good in that it's gone, it hadn't spread and it was picked up very early, however I cannot lie about how scared I was and still am and how much I've cried; I have a mixture of feelings from one day to the next still very emotional but wanting to get through the treatment and move on. I have had lots of support from family and friends and it has helped me to talk about what I've had and been through; most importantly my husband has been amazing so if you have a partner then my advice would be to talk about it. I'm missing my running but try and have a walk everyday to help clear my head, get some exercise and fresh air; I've set myself a target of doing my first 10k next August Good luck, try and be positive and give yourself something to aim for xx",

      "Content": "Hi Dreamthief Sorry for the delay in responding, still learning how tonusevthe site and not been feeling brilliant over last couple of weeks. I've now had my radiotherapy planning appointment and my three tattoos are done; I start my 15 sessions of radiotherapy on Thursday 22nd October. I had my DEXA bone scan on Monday this week and fortunately it seems all is good with my bones.  I have been feeling very emotional, it's as if I'm only just realising what I've been and still am going through. Some days I'm ok and then others I'm really down and I'm feeling very anxious about my radiotherapy. I'm sure I'll be ok. the Letrozole tablets are giving me really bad hog flushes and at 55 I really did think I'd seen the back if these but obviously not; this affecting my sleep and my confidence when in company as its really embarrassing and I don't want people to feel sorry for me. Does that sound stupid?  Really good to have this forum so thank you so much ",
