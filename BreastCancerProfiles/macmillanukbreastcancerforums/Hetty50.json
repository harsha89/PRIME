      "Content": "I did cold cap as I wanted to keep my hair.  Yes it was challenging but I took paracetamol before the cap went on as recommended by the helpful people on here.  My hair has gone thin and I had a bald patch on the crown which I protected with a piece of gauze (as recommended by Paxman) on the last 3 cycles.  I was advised that the cap wasn\u2019t fitted properly so please make sure you get the right size.  I know you are in the chemo ward a lot longer but for me it was worth it.  I finished chemo 3 weeks ago and the hair has stopped coming out when I wash it.  You can get from the internet Volumon a hair building fibre which is brilliant to hide the patch up. It would be worth giving it a try and if it is not for your daughter she can go back to the conventional treatment. I send your daughter all my good wishes. Hetty 50",

      "Content": "I took paracetamol as advised on here.  It really helped.  I am due for my 5th chemo next week and have done the cold cap.  Although my hair has thinned and I am going thin on the crown I have kept my hair.  I am hoping that the next 2 cycles won\u2019t affect my hair too much. The cap as you probably know needs to fit properly and be tight..  I wish you all the best with the treatment and a good recovery.  It is a shock when you are diagnosed but the help and support on here gets you through it. My very best wishes to you. Hetty50",

      "Content": "Noticed that someone else has mentioned hair shredding today.  I have had 2 cold caps and going very thin on the crown.  Disappointing but there was no guarantee with the cold cap anyway.  I have read that you can buy some powder that you can put on the scalp to help cover this up.  Has anyone used this product and if so, the name and where do I get it from. Went on a Look good, Feel better workshop yesterday at City Hospital, Birmingham and it was excellent.  So many helpful tips with very friendly staff.  Didn\u2019t realise I would come away with a goody bag full of good brands of products and even perfume.  Would recommend going to one. This site has been so helpful and supportive.  I wish you all a good recovery.",

I know it is hard but you will get there and I wish you all the best with your treatment. Merry Christmas and best wishes Hetty x",

The crown seems to be the worse.  The last session the chemo nurse said you could remove the cap after 10 minutes and it doesn\u2019t make much difference. Looking at your reply from lynnwad perhaps I should have kept it on for longer.  I will insist this week. Hope it is successful for you and best wishes for a good recovery. Hetty50",

      "Content": "Thanks for your reply. The first time I had the cap it was kept on for some time as the Charge Nurse said it had to be.  When it came off I had ice particles on my scalp.  Unfortunately the next two cycles didn\u2019t have the same result.  They gave me the smallest cap and I thought it was tight but obviously not tight enough.  All they keep saying is that there is no guarantee you will keep your hair.  Obviously it depends on the staff on the day.  I will ensure this time it is tight and insist it is kept on longer.  I am somewhat disappointed that I have put myself through this as the ice cream headache is not pleasant.  I am on FEC. Your help is very much appreciated. Best Wishes and a big hug Hetty50 xx",

      "Content": "I can understand how you feel.  I was reluctant to have chemo after a lumpectomy.  I was triple negative, grade 3 with no lymph node involvement but it was advisable.  After speaking to the breast care nurse and the Oncologist I decided to go ahead.  When I was asked how I would feel if cancer came back and I had declined chemo how would I feel.  The decision was made. I did scalp cooling and managed to keep most of my hair although it has gone thin. Yes chemo some weeks was tough but you get through it. I am now having radiotherapy but I am still glad I made that decision. I wish you all the best with whatever decision you make. Hetty x",
