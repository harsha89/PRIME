      "Content": "Dear Sascha Rose I only joined this group in November and havent posted much but I have been following the various threads, yours in particular. It breaks my heart to read what you are going through. Last night I tried to go back over your 700 odd posts to find out why they told you that you couldnt have a reconstruction. I only saw snap shots of each post and unfortunatly I am still non the wiser as to what happened. Is there anyway that you could tell me what went wrong or why you havent been offered a recon? If this is too painful for you to write I completely understand but I just want to understand the whole story. I am thinking of you and so wish there was something that I could do to help you. Funki x",

I have seen the other lovely ladies on here offer you loads of advice, most of which you have tried or is impossible because you say you cant move back here to the UK. I cant offer any advice and I feel so bloody usless. I just want you to know that I feel for you so much and that I am thinking of you.",
