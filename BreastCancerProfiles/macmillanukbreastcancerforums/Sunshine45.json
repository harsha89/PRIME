      "Content": "Hi Blhope, I had two lumps when diagnosed in Sept 2016, Mutifocal, I think they called it., 2cm and 1.5cm Triple Negative. I thought 2 must be worse than one, but both the surgeon and Oncologist didn't seem that concerned, I was told they take the measurement from largest lump to work out staging, my lumps were close together, I'm not sure if they are further apart. I was stage one.  Sept 2016 had SLNB - No lymph nodes involved Oct 2016 had Lumpectomy - clear margins Nov 2016 - started Chemo 6 cycles every 3 weeks March 2017 - 3 weeks of Radiotherapy I have had 2 clear mammograms and am currently having Zoledronic Acid infusions to help prevent bone Mets.  I know it is worrying when we find lump/s but once you know what your plan is, you will be able to deal with it better. Let me know if I can be of any help. Best wishes",
