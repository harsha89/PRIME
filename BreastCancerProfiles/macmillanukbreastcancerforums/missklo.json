    "Content": "Hey there, I would definately suggest demanding a referral from your GP. I was diagnosed with breast cancer at 27 after finding a lump. The GP did refer me but due to the fact I had no family history and my age it was referred as non-urgent and ending up taking 7 weeks for the hospital appt. I had also been getting discomfort under my arm and in my breast that was almost like mini electric shocks. The reason I wanted to reply is not that you necessarily have anything to worry about but the reassurance you will get from a \"proper\" check like a scan or mammogram is what you really need. In my opinion, worrying about the unknown can do more emotional damage than dealing with a result like cancer. So get yourself back to the GP and DEMAND that referral!! I have everything crossed for you and hope you get the answers you need, good luck honey, Kirsty  xxx",
