      "Content": "Hello Baki, It sounds like you have done everything you can to keep well..Despite all your efforts there is cancer progression which you  cannot control  I think as women we are very good at blaming ourselves for our predicament e.g if I hadn't been so stressed at work, been overweight etc...because we need to have a reason for having this disease, to almost make sense of it.The medical team seem to be working hard through appeals and that is a good thing, not all health trusts would do this..but you are worth it.It sounds like there is hope.Everything you are feeling,hopeless and frightened seems  normal and part of the adjustment process to the fact that the cancer is not curative.I work in a hospital and I know patients have accessed the psychologist and macmillan practitioners and found it really helped. I am stage 3,but I have written my will and made practical plans so I could feel  in control. It was difficult because I thought by planning/thinking about my death I might make it happen and family thought I was been defeatist. However, in regard to my children I wanted them to have security if the worst should happen. The Vita online mag has some good bloggers on it who have secondary breast cancer ,maybe you should take a look. Fingers well and truly crossed for the appeals and sending you positive vibes!",

I wish you weren't having such a shitty time...but having a good cry and a rage at the world is probably the best medicine right now. What about gabepentin at night for flushes ? Can help with sleep and is good for nerve pain..not sure about bone.Why dont u get a double appointment at GP so she has more time? It doesn't sound like you are getting the attention from GP/BCN that you deserve.bx",
