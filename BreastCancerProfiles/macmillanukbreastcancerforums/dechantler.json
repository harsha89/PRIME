    "Content": "Hi Suzie I have finished my Chemotherapy and Radiotherapy now but sounds like I hac the same chemo treatment as you are going through. I had 3 x FEC and then 3 x Taxodere. The Taxodere had totally different side effects to the FEC, I found it harder to deal with as the aches and pains made me feel quite poorly for about 4-5 days each session. I kept a diary from the start of all my treatment as the side effects followed the same pattern each session. I found when I had my chemo on a Wednesday I would be fine till Saturday and then would be crap from Saturday till Thursday. I never noticed my finger nails becoming ridged or weak till I was doing my Radiotheraphy, I also still find my finger tips have a slight tingle and the nerves in the ends are very sensitive - as in picking up a piece of toast out of the toaster was too hot?? The tips of my toes also have the same tingling - they said it was the Taxodere. hope this helps, keep strong Debbie x          ",
