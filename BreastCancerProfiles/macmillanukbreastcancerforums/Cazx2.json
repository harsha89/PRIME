    "Content": "I know all about that one, Ruthless! It took a good 6-8 weeks of nagging to get my husband to the doctor.As he'd smoked for nearly 50 years I KNEW that his increasingly hoarse voice was bad news. Still at least I got him there & the GP didn't hang about & he was referred under the 2 week rule. I'm just thankful that if he had to get a smoking related cancer it was his larynx & not his lungs. Oh, and he has stopped smoking, which I realise was not an easy thing to do. Anyway our GP rates among 'The Good' in my book. Caz",
