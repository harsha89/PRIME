I wasn't keen on taking meds for years on end (how that has changed!) I had killer flushes (bright red, heart racing, a nice sheen on the hour every hour - that was great when in the office, and night sweats that left me literally dripping all over) But the doctor did recommend I take the herbs Black Cohosh, Red Clover and Flaxseed. So went for Menopause tablets. They alleviated the symptoms noticeably. That and a lady magnet.... Hope this helps.",

      "Content": "Hi Louisey2, I was told to get the flu jab in no uncertain terms. I ended up having it on the same day as my first FEC-T chemo (which I understand is heavy duty stuff chemo-wise). No effects or symptoms resulted. The key thing, it seems, is to make sure that it is an intern version of the jab. I wasn't sure, as the one jab I ever had made me feel more ill than I was when I did have flu back in the day. But things have moved on so much... This is from an asthmatic... Hope this helps... mccaca",

Epsom Salt is great for pulling toxins out through the skin, and all you need to do is buy it cheaper in bulk then chuck some in the bath - easy. Hope this adds to the useful list..... ",

      "Content": "Ditto!! I had double mastectomy on the very same day. I keep reminding myself how long it took for the early biopsy bruises to pass by......especially the core biopsy when stuck at an awkward angle in the mammo chair...... On the left side I only had a sentinel biopsy, it is still numb and very slightly sore in places but I have all the movement I used to (can still reach the shoulder blade for a good scratch). I can finally turn and sleep on that side with sore sensations, but it is tolerable. On the right hand side I had 26 nodes cleared out and am still numb and v sore. I get those nerve twitches from time to time, and movement still has that rubber band from hell associiated with it. Have to admit, the right hand side developed a massive haematoma which had to be cleared under general, so only three weeks in... Conclusion is... when they say 4-6 weeks to heal, it takes 6 weeks........ Not looking forward to the Rads......",

Only 6 weeks into anastrozole, so only have hot flushes at the mo (much lighter than doing the real thing in the raw) but before this rollercoaster started, I found epsom salts and a good soak in the bath really helped with proper aches...it might only be a minor help in your case, but every little helps as they say..... It's not related, but I trained as a reflexologist and had several treatments during training, it really does help balance the whole body and ease all inflammation.....if you live in Oxfordshire/Warwickshire, would be happy to give you a free sample...

      "Content": "I agree. Day by Day. In Feb I was told the MRI showed that chemo had completely eradicated my Stage 3 and calciferous on the other side....then histology after the double mx in March showed bad bap still had a 2.6 Stage 1 and 12 node husks......As Bones McCoy in Star Trek would have said, despite all their good work, we are still early days medically.........) The lessons I learned then and have applied post mx (plus 2nd ga surgery to have a massive Haemo rummaged n jet washed) are... You can only deal with one stage at a time, so deal with that and only get next steps/basic info for the rest, otherwise your brain could melt with all the half-info. Wait to get real info face to face with the people that actually know and work with it day to day (but question them, there is no such thing as an expert really) Worrying doesn't help, if you don't know, it will drain you  if you can't effect the result, you're wasting life energy Remember what you have - in my case an uber curmudgeon/ratbag of a hubby, but he's always there when you need him (He's from Yorkshire, so it's usually only a flesh wound....but when you need someone to kick off and put your case, none better) Think on and beyond...me, I'm going to give up being an Business Analyst and finally become a herbalist once EU prohibitions have been removed and we can go back to 2010, also going to all those European festivals that put our 'cheese down a hill 'day to shame, and adding the Maldives as a side bonus..... Methinks we are lucky we have stuff in our face, a recognised thing.....for about a year leading up to diagnosis I felt completely and increasingly tired and had to battle each day....I was told to buck up, stop being a stupid lazy *********. Now I'm excused.....to take care of self more..... As should we all...(that includes you btw....)",

      "Content": "As an eczema sufferer, I've tried all sorts of creams. Most just aggravated the skin. Aqueous Cream is alright, but it took me decades to learn that it is intended as an alternative soap!  I found that natural oils work very well, and they feed the skin too. A reasonably priced option is Sweet Almond Oil, or even better (but more expensive) is Argan Oil. Both work really well on the nails as well if you rub them into your cuticles when doing the hands. They are chemical-free and have hardly any fragrance (so no competition with the perfume etc.). Both can be bought at high street stores such Holland and B or Boots. Good luck in your search. mccaca.",
