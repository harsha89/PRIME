I was told to buy a sports bra and found the best ones in premark  Asdas also do post op bras.  On the Breast cancer thread there are peole at the same stage as you I havent been on today to see if youve found them  I posted your post on there and saw a few replies have a look if you find it lol. I know you will get lots of suport on here like I have had.  And wishing you all the best with your op. Take care Lots of love Lorraine  ",
