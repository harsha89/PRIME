I have shown my (female) family the scar and let them see what the prothesis is like, I think it is important they understand what is happening - just in case, this bloody disease is so common. The operation wasn't hard to get over, I had lymph nodes removed as well and that left my arm feeling really strange and some reduction in movement. When I had to have an ECG which meant getting top half naked I completely went to pieces, so some body image issues in front of strangers - the radiologist was fab though. I have some other health issues as well so will wait to decide on reconstruction and possible reduction of the real one when I am out of the woods. Good luck with your op  ",

Think that was all they did, took a while but trekking around the hospital to various departments for tests and then queuing for them took some time. it's a good time to ask questions about what is going to happen.The nurses that do the clerking don't necessarily know about specific procedures but there was the registrar and the aneastheatist (?sp)",

The MRI scan on your breasts is however Bizarre. Who ever thought that having square cut outs for a woman to dangle her boobs though was a good idea was probably from another planet. I asked the assistant if they had the biggest size available and she replied 'we have never had anyone who didn't fit before' well love, you have now! Another assistant who didn't like to touch my breasts as we struggled to get them in position was so embarassed, and then 40 minutes of something like a star wars battle going on all around you while you lie still and let them shoot! Only the next day when I had an MRI on my pelvis I realised she hadn't actually got the headphones on my ears the first time! Have to say not the best day in my BC experience. Although the telling has made my friends howl with laughter - always the best medicine especially with something as un funny as BC.   Hugs x x x x Annie                       t",

Once I had the operation I needed to take things easy and have been off work for 10 months - I am due to go back mid August, so if financially you are not struggling you may well find the time useful - you will be able to put yourself first which is probably as steep learning curve for you too.

I am probably a good bit older than you as my periods finished a few years ago, but I had a full hysterectomy 6 weeks after my mastectomy. I am still reeling and every day look at my scars and think 'how did this happen'. It took some planning and organisation to get fit after 1 op ready for the next, in my case time is critical, and I need to start chemo asap as well. So I have looked at diet and exercise and made sure that I am doing the best I can to help my body cope with it all. Mentally it is a huge rollercoaster , 2 big ops, and in my case 2 diffferent cancers, I am reeling every time I think of the enormity of it all. I think my head will explode sometimes. I can talk about it in little bite size pieces but get very tearful when talking to people outside the family. The hairdresser went into melt down when she said 'what you planning to do with your hair in the future?' and the tears arrived by the bucket full for (to her at least) no apparent reason. But you are right getting it over and done with together does mean back to being you sooner, it's mad how much you can miss doing the things that used to be so routine.

I had a chest and pelvis CT scan for another problem and was called in for the results with some urgency to be told that I had breast cancer. I month later I had a mastectomy and all of the lymph nodes removed from my left side. analysis showed cancer cells in all 20 of the lymph nodes, I am currently waiting for bone scan results. My cancer like yours is lobular, like you I found no obvious signs, on the morning of the mastectomy I felt the area and could only tell there was soemthing there becasue I knew where it was! My mammegramm 2 years ago showed nothing, but the size and the number of lymph nodes affected suggests it had been there for some time. 4 weeks on and I am recovering well, there is some discomfort and I still have the fluid drained off each week - that is not painful. I massage my left arm every morning with oil to keep the skin in good condition and to help prevent the lymphodema that can occur. My body is healing - my mind is still on the rollercoaster. some friends are brilliant and help, some friends aren't really friends at all. Next week I go fo a hysterectomy (the original problem) and hopefully that will not require follow up, but it could be cancer as well. I can only tell you my experiance and what works for me, You are unique and will handle it in your own way but you are not on your own, this disease affects so many and there are many of us here who do perhaps understand some of your agony and anxiety. I have, by chance, a cancer buddy, who I was facebook friends with ( rather than real friends), She is at the end of chemo now and to a great extent she has held my hand as I have gone through these dark weeks. She tells me how things are for her and what has helped her and what hasn't worked for her, she has listened to me cry, laugh, swear shout and has been there whenever I needed someone. I think you will be surprised how many people you already know who have been down this path, perhaps you can find a 'buddy' who knows some of what happens and can help you through. I wish I could tell you that this is all going to be Ok and this is the worst bit. I can't and it isn't but there are lots of us here who will be here through your treatment and help you feel less isolated through it all. big hugs Annie                                                ",

I suffered awful pain with the injections you get to boost white cell production so stock up on pain relief but be wary of the ones that cause constipation - see note above. My oncologist told me to have a flu jab the nurse at the surgery nearly laid an egg because I wasn't on the list. But I won and had the injection! Number one thing on my list would be my cancer buddy! if you know or can find someone who has had the same treatment or similar treatment to you that you can ring, text or e-mail at the drop of a hat go for it. at your lowest ebb you having someone who can say 'yes it is awful but it will get easier' is a godsend. This is difficult for you, but your friends, family and acquaintances are really going to struggle and they won't know what to say to you - your cancer buddy will understand how you feel about all the inane, daft and plain idiotic things that  people say to you because they really don't know what else to say. and your cancer buddy is the one person you can be totally honest with, because he/she will know what it's like and you won't have to protect him/her from the truth of what is happening to you. I have been lucky enough to have 2 people to help me through this, You're going to have some peaks and troughs on the roller coaster ride in the chemo weeks but this is the worst bit, so hang in there, you CAN do it. and life  will start to look good again at the other end.

      "Content": "Hello Tracey, it is an awful time, waiting for the op and thinking about everything that comes after. you will get through and learn how to cope with the changes to your body, your circle of friends (sadly you learn who are real friends and who are just people you know) and your life. everyone approaches this differently and has different concerns and different pressure points. each of those are as valid and as imprtant to each individual so never feel that you are doing soemthing wrong or being unreasonable etc etc. your are not, this is your illness and your are the one who is dealing with it. the waffle below describes some of my experiences - I hope it helps you and doesn't worry you more. each stage is another step where you learn more about yourself and your world, it isn't all good but it isn't all bad either. I was scared about the op, firstly because my mother died during a life saving operation so i was really frightened that I wouldn't wake up. Secondly I have large breasts (JJ cup) so it was going to be a massive difference. 5 months on I have found some bras that fit well and hold the prothesis, it is quite hard to see which is which - although I think other BC ladies can probably tell! Look at the web sites for bras and talk to the BC nurse about the prothesis. they will give you a 'softy' when you come out of hospital, I found that the weight difference meant I had one boob under my chin and one on my waist when I wore the softy - I think even 'Aunty Gok' would struggle to make that look good. - but Annette the lovely BC nurse sorted me out very quickly and I was wearing the prothesis after a week - and it didn't bother the scar at all, the softy was consigned to the bin soon after that. And don't let the dog chew the prothesis - it gets messy and they don't taste good (apparantly). I have also had to re think my wardrobe - with a knock out cleavage many of my tops were v necks, not ever so low - they do reveal too much now so that neede some thought.but I didn't want to change my style (what little there was) either. I am having chemo and will then have radiation followed by letrazole for 5 years. I had my hair clipped to 1\" long when it started to fall out, and now wear a wig or a hat. my husband said it really suited me! What pure white and big bald patches - I know he meant well. I am frustrated that my beard and moustache hairs are taking much longer to stop growing - that seems unfair. The operation wasn't too hard to get over, physically I was quite well and able to cook and clean and walk the dogs fairly soon, got back to normal activity in about 4 weeks although my lovely friends wouldn't let me lift, carry or push too much - how they nag me. For me the mental issues are much harder. I see in my daughters eyes the fear she has, my step son is fantastic but he is scared and shocked. Good friends have suddenly got very busy but I have made some surprising new friends. My husband is himself unwell and is also a very selfish introverted man who really doesn't know how to cope. trying to do things sympathetically to help them is hard and to some extent I have to let them deal with it themselves. My warped, odd sense of humour doesn't help them either. Everyone has different things that they have to deal with. You can get through this, but it is a roller coaster both emptionally and physically, so don't beat yourself upwhen you feel down, cry, get angry, shout etc - and try to put yourself first and think about what you need. that's really hard I think becasue we are so used to putting children, family and work before our own needs - that does have to change now. and remember, treatments have improved, prognosis is improved, breast cancer is survivable. Good luck. Annie",

My lovely friends at the stable who take it turns to muck out the stable, groom and exercise my mare, and now I am back doing a bit myself they empty the wheel barrow do the heavy lifting and if the horses are being silly (frequently!) bring my mare in so she doesn't pull me about. Aren't we lucky (amongst all of the c@@p this cancer brings us) to have found such wonderful people around us.",

I took my surgical stockings off after 2 weeks as well and was told I should keep them on for 6 weeks after hysterectomy. there seems to be little consistency in thinking between different teams in the same hospital never mind between different trusts - it makes this journey even more stressful and mind blowing.",

      "Content": "Hi Mollydog. I had mastectomy and full lymph node clearance on 21st September last year. The back of my arm and the top and back of my shoulder are still numb, my arm pit still feels thick and odd, but the pins and needles have stopped and the numbness in my fingers has gone.  Do your exercises regularly because that will stretch the tendons and muscles and you will then get more movement back  - I didn't do my exercises and then couldn't lift my arm far so the radiation treatment was very uncomfortable - I have since done them regularly and can lift my arm quite well. the itching and not being able to feel the scratch is just one of those little jokes that this whole cancer thing likes to play on us. Is it worth it? They found cancer in every one of my lymph nodes although mine was a grade 2 which should have meant that it hadn't spread too far. I don't know what I would have done if they had given me the decision to make about whether or not I had them removed - I glad they made the decision for me. In the great scheme of things I can live quite happily with the odd sensations I get in my arm - it isn't painful and it doesn't stop me doing anything I might want although I probably won't take up boxing cos I won't have much  of a left hook! there are other complications but I haven't had any of them so couldn't discuss. Don't beat yourself up for making the decision you made  - it is what it is,you were giving yourself the best shot at living long. So live long and prosper!  ",

      "Content": "I had mine drained 9 times before it finally dried up - felt like I was growing a new boob the first 3 weeks. if you are uncomfortable ask the BC nurse to have it drained - if their procedures are good the risk of infection should be managed. I didn't have to ask becasue it is standard procedure at my hospital - also gives them the chance to check on the wound, that it is healing OK. I think as well they like to see that their lasdies are coping with everything. hopw it clears soon.",
