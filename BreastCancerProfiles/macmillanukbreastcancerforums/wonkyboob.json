      "Content": "Hi Sally Lou I went to my doctor 7 weeks ago to get a frozen shoulder sorted. I ended up telling him about my wonky boob feeling active again and got sent off for a mammogram, they biopsied me there and then (core biopsy of left breast and sentinel lymph node) and told me they thought I had a malignant tumour. I have since has a small op to remove the lump and send off for histology, I get the results tomorrow.  I was, like you, feeling that this was all connected and completely paranoid about it. I asked to have an MRI which they did last week and it turns out that it is unrelated to whatever is happening with my wonky boob. I actually just have a frozen shoulder and there is no sinister pathology in my MRI. I know how hard this is but try not to get sucked in to the dark and twisty stuff that whirls around your head. Im not sure if 'staying positive' is achievable but i have found that by denying myself the opportunity to think to much about the 'what if's\" has helped a lot over the last 5 weeks. I am going to think positive thoughts about your bloody painful frozen shoulder and look forward to comparing stupid shoulder recovery tips with you!  WBx",

      "Content": "Hi.  Yes that seems to be what Superstar Marsden Surgeon has suggested. Im just concerned that she explained there could be a small cancer in the centre of the lesion. Its odd because when I was having my guide wire put in before the op the radiologist apologised for how many mammograms they were having to take because 'its hard to pinpoint your teeny tiny cancer with the wire\"  Then super star surgeon on monday used that same phrase 'teeny tiny cancer' in your left breast.  I know I just have to suck it up and wait until tomorrow but I just feel fed up of waiting and the uncertainty is getting a little on top of me now. Its not like I have experienced before with a simple biopsy result and a yes or no to the results. Am I right to feel concerned that my local hospital don't know what it is and they haven't mentioned this Radial Scar to me? I have remained very positive through this and will continue to do but am just having moment this afternoon.  WBx",

      "Content": "Hi, I'm new to this group and wanted to ask if anyone has been diagnosed with a Radial Scar?  5 Weeks ago I had a Core biopsy of my left breast and sentinel lymph node, I was told they were 95% certain I had a malignant tumour. We were introduced to my Macmillan care nurse and talked through what would happen next.  Biopsy results 5 days later showed no evidence of cancer but the clinical team were convinced it was a malignant tumour. 10 days ago I had a wire guided excision biopsy which turned into a lumpectomy (apparently the lesion came out complete?) My surgeon and the breast team have said they are completely stumped by the look of the lesion and really don't know what it is. I saw another surgeon on monday at The Marsden, was really lucky to get an appointment with her. She said that she thinks it is something called a Radial Scar. No one over the last 5 weeks has mentioned this, only that they think this presents as a malignant tumour and are stumped if its not.  I get the results tomorrow. Does anyone have any experience of Radial Scars? there is so much contradictory info out there. (that it is a type of cancer itself/ precursor to other breast cancers/my chances of breast cancer are increased by 7 to 200%)  I'm just 40 and have been back and forth for mammograms/ultrasounds/biopsies for last 6 and half years. My wonky boob is very active and dense and has had a history of cysts. I'd love to hear any advice on what appears to be a rare condition.  Thanks so much WBx",
