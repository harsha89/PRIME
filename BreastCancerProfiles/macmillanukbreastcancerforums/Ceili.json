      "Content": "Thanks for your lovely comment, Jojo!  It can be a lonely journey and I haven't talked about it that much.... Hi Badgerset, just a little hello, enjoyed your 'bring it on'! :) Ref. nails, I was told that they can discolour or worse, to use nail strengthener.  So far, on day 9 of first cycle, they are starting to go darker...skin on my hands is dry and they feel slightly swollen.  I am using coconut butter a few times a day. Also, this is the first day the pains from the Neulast injection subsided.  Yippieh!!  Has anyone else had an advers reaction?  I ended up in A&E after it was injected, and its now cancelled from all further cycles. Have a nice day everyone! Ceili",

      "Content": "So, the hair is off!  Shaved it before it could come out in lumps and make me look like the bogey woman!  Sooo strange.  But its not too bad.  How do people treat me now, I wonder.  I went to a music session last Friday with a cap on.  And got all sorts of mixed reactions.  The worst one for me was being stared at and avoided.  Like a lepar.  Ah well, like someone said on here somewhere (yes, have done a lot of reading) people are afraid. And maybe a little lost as to what to say, how to be.... not unlike myself!  Life is different all of sudden. Jojo and Mazza, sounds like you are having a tough time at the minute, hope you will get over the humps soon! Friday 2nd cycle.  TC is what I have, which is Docetaxal (Taxodere) and Cyclophosphamide.  Ceili xx",
