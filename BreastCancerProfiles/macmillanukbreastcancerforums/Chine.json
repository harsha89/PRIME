    "Content": "Hi I am coming late to this but have only started chemo recently. I can\u2019t really add anything to the honey debate except I wish you could take it with something because it is really sweet and difficult when you hate sweet stuff! what I did want to say as a doctor myself is that just because something isn\u2019t prescribed, it does not mean it doesn\u2019t work. There are so much data out there, so much to learn and practice, and virtually all of it basedÂ on western medical principles. That doesn\u2019t leave much if any room for alternatives. You would also be surprised how many effective treatments are not in routine practice, just because others are well entrenched. obviously that doesn\u2019t mean you should believe everything you read, and in our situation, we are more vulnerable than most to hope. But just don\u2019t discount things because they are not routinely prescribed.",
