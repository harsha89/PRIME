      "Content": "Hi tmh I started Anastrozole in January this year and do have the hot flushes and my arthritis is much worse every joint seems to be screaming some days! It is a side effect but I have found I now get a good day now and again so determined to continue. I have tried a few things too (paradox oil). As I say some days are much worse than others. I take mine at bedtime so the worst seems to over before lunchtime. I have not heard of anyone not being affected by these. I hope you feel better soon. Take care x Enter your message...",

      "Content": "Hi Angel As everyone else has said pls do not feel alone we have all been there. The waiting is perhaps the cruellest part and my heart goes out to you. I am 7mths over my mastectomy and 16yrs over my bowel cancer so understand the feeling of  being alone with your fears. When you know you face chemo and radiotherapy it can be very depressing. I cried so much I said I am not going thru Chemo after having Bowel surgery, but I did so am here 16yrs later, age 62. I have to say my breast cancer was a more positive experience as I thought it would be like my earlier cancer. There is such a rapport with your fellow patients lots of  tears but lots of laughs too. Please don't b afraid to ask for help from here or your nurses/Gp We can all help. Love and best wishes xo Enter your message...",
