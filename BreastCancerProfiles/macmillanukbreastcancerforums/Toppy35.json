    "Content": "Hi I finished chemotherapy/radiotherapy on 12/9 after having full lymph node clearance and lumpectomy in February this year of grade 3.  I have now been told they have found something on my hip (secondary) although status unclear presently so waiting for a further comparitive scan in December and find out the results mid January 2017.  Does anyone have any advice regarding returning to work? I also have ME (chronic fatigue syndrome), so have been told not to push myself to return to work.  I was advised to take 8-12 weeks after radiotherapy to recover, however due to side effects of taking Letrozole and being prescribed three different brands in three months, I don't know if I am coming or going - the side effects are intense and making me severely tired, I am having hot flushes for fun and cannot sleep at night.  Also I am having difficulty obtaining the same brand of letrozole and have been advised by my doctors surgery that it is not possible to specify a specific brand of the letrozole.  Is this the case, has anyone else had any problems and does anyone have any advice? Thanking you in anticipation   Tracy (Dukinfield)",
