      "Content": "Hi I am new to this group, was diagnosed stage 1 in Sep18, had lumpectomy in Oct18, then radiotherapy with last session 17/12. Started Tamoxifen in October. On levothyroxine and citalopram as well. Started with what I thought was thrush but even going to loo caused stinging. Been to drs and not thrush but severe dermatitis down there and skin breaking when wiping. Been back at work since 7/1 and was starting to feel more myself, how many more possible side affects do we have to face? Â ",
