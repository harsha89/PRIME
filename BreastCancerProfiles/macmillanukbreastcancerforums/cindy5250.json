The only treatment I am having is for pain relief but in the last few days I have a horrible taste in my mouth and don't know how to combat it, any ideas???? everything I try to eat has a horrible taste, even extremely sweet foods. Nurse is not due until Tuesday so would like to rectify before then if possible. Many thanks.",
