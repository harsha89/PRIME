      "Content": "I have had all my treatment in Germany,the hardest thing for me was the language barrier,and that was no ones fault,I have at times felt very frustrated,frightened unsure.But never once did I not believe that the medics were doing the best they could for me,here there is no mamby pambying,the Germans are very efficiant,abrupt and straight to the point there is no privacy on the wards, no reasuring words from the nurses their job seemed to be more about medical than emotional support,nothing in the way of aftercare or lovely little group meetings ie ; Look good feel good,Ive often read comments on here and been quite jealous of the things offered to plenty in the UK.I have had to find out information and have reports medically translated for myself.I researched the chemos I was to be given,made sure I was well prepared for any potential side affects,and just basically got on with it,I was and have been however very lucky in that I didnt have trouble with my bloods. I AM JUST VERY GRATEFUL TO BE ALIVE. This has been the biggest rollercoaster ride of my life,One that I have lived through.I intent to make the most of it,however tough things are always try to find positives and keep a good state of mind,I have no friends or family here,and without this mental attitude at times I might have rolled over and gave in. Good luck to all on here and stay strong...xx",

She also told me that it would be more advisable to wait until after Radiotherapy to move back to the UK,I knew this made sense,so will arrange a move for September some time I found online a really good informative health site that Drs answer your questions aswell as patients,so have managed to sort out and understand most of the medical terms on my paperwork now. I phoned macmillans,but they didnt seem to know what the tec terms meant on my paperwork,so didnt gte any joy there,wasnt a very productive phone call.maybe when I am basck in the UK their services will be better suited to me.I didnt just want to use them for a good old moan...lol...even though this would have done me the world of good... Well onwards and upwards..... thanks again Allison...xxx",

      "Content": "Hi Char, Thanks for your reply,Unfortunately I have no BCN nurse.I do know that if I dont feel well I have to go to the hospital,that aside I have bloods taken every Wednesday inbetween chemo and thats it,There is no after care here,you basically have to just get on with it.I wasnt even told I had TNBC,I thought that BC was that,didnt know there was different types,what an eye opener,I worked this out from translating my paperwork on google,which is not the best tool to use for medical words,I have since had it translated by a medical interperitor.Its through this site that I have learnt as much as I have. I am going to phone and hopefully speak to a Macmillan nurse on monday,I would like to move back to the UK now,but dont want to interrupt or delay any treatment,so will wait until the Rads finishes.I will be moving to cardiff,I know of the cancer hospital there,so hopefully will get some advice from Macmillan on how to transfer etc,I have copies of scans and paperwork,I dont know if its the same in the Uk but they seem to give you copies of everything here. My prognosis on paper seems pretty lousy,I think this was calculated by Adjuvent online,I think a lot of my anxiety stems from this,hopefully the macmillan nurse might be able to clarify it for me. I have no social network or friends here,just myself, husband and dog,All family including my daughters and friends in the UK.Its quite a lonely process to go through.Although they are visiting regular and thankgod for skype,these are keeping me sane. Its reasuring to know that yourself and others with TNBC are fairing well.its frightening to think that after rads your in the luck of the gods.but maybe thats better than going through what the women who have to take tamoxifen seem to suffer.

      "Content": "Hi,I was diagnosed and operated on in December 10,TNBC grade and stage 3,had lumpectomy and  13 lymph nodes removed.the 2nd day after surgery a physio came to see me and showed me exercises,I quickly forgot them and guessed my way through exercise,I live in Germany,the language barrier is a huge problem,but I am managing my way,just. Physio I dont have the energy to try to find a physio and go through the guessing and understanding thing,The problem I have is that if i extend my right arm I can put it straight,when I try to turn my arm it wont and is slightly painful,my arm is still weak,should this have resolved by now and anyone got exercise tips to help. Steroids I am 2 of 8 chemo sessions in 4xEC and 4Tax to be followed by 6wks rads 1st chemo I was poorly for 1 week then not too bad,the steroids made me feel horrendous.I have a port fitted in my chest and before chemo they injected steroid,they gave me tabs to take twice daily for 4 days after 4mg Dex. After 2nd chemo I didnt take the steroids and was only poorly for 3 days,I presumed they were only given for sickness,but now believe they may also have been given to avoid allergic reaction,My 3rd chemo is next wed,If the English speaking nurse is on duty I will ask her,if not I am back to guessing,My question I suppose is:will not taking the steroids cause more harm than good. Would be grateful for any advice. Thanks and best wishes to all.. Allison xx  ",

The hospital also give me Emend and Omeprazole to take for a few days,these tabs are fine,no reaction.If  the english nurse is not on duty,then I will just avoid taking the steroids again,atleast until the chemo changes to the Taxotere,this I think is more toxic,so hopefully the english speaking Dr or an interperitor will be able to clarify things for me, I am planning on moving back to the UK as soon as possible after treatment,hopefully early September,If I have no delays in any treatment then I think my last week of rads should be end of August the latest.Do you see Oncologist when rads finishes,as there is no more treatment or meds to take. Char, Pleased you are through your treatment,how were you after and how often do you need to be checked ,  Thanks Allison..xxxxx",
