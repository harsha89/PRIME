      "Content": "Hi M65, I have the same symptoms few days after each FEC treatment. My GP said I have mild constipation even I did go to toilet. I was prescribed Macrogol drink to take which soften the stool and suppositories to reduce the piles. After a few days, the symptoms settled but have to continue with the Macrogol drink until I finish my last chemo treatment (GP & Oncologist adv). Hope this help but still get your GP check it up. Hope everything settle soon!!! Kim x",
