      "Content": "Hi ,   I had 4 FEC at 3 weekly intervals and then 12 weekly TAXOL. I worked throughout with just chemo day off as the side effects weren't bad. I did get some awful spots on my face and a little bit of tingling in my fingers. However it does hammer your white blood cell count as I had it weekly - so I did flounder a little around no 8 and had to have a couple of weeks off. Still I managed to complete the whole course without any real issues.   Good luck - its a whole lot easier than FEC. x",

I did have private treatment though through my company health scheme so I am not sure if they are available on the NHS.   They are brilliant - all chemo ,blood tests and Herceptin are given/taken through them  - they sit completely under the skin so there is little risk of infection and they don't need flushing every week so very low maintenance. If you can I would push for this option.",

It is totally different to how my normal personality is and I am finding it very difficult to deal with.   I really don't want to go onto antidepressants so was wondering if anyone else had tried any natural remedies or if symtpoms eased after being on it longer.
