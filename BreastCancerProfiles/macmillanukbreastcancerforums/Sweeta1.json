      "Content": "Hi Carlie, hope you've not had a too bad a day today. Emotions are a funny thing aren't they? Like I said most of the time I feel very positive, but I've had a few 'wobbly' moments, I haven't felt any anger yet - perhaps this is yet to come. Regarding the reconstruction this is such a personal thing and only you, with your surgeons help, can make the best decision for you. Once my surgery and any other treatment I need is finished I will then have my other breast operated on to make me less lopsided. This is needed as at the moment I'm a dd/e cup and the largest reconstruction my surgeon can give me is a c cup. I had the results to my lymph node byopsy last Thursday and thankfully they were clear.  Like you say there is an information overload, but we just need to give ourselves time to digest this.  I am also finding things difficult as I am a staff nurse and I'm  hating being 'on the other side' as it were. Hate the loss of control over my own body. Good luck with your byopsy results. Ann xx",

      "Content": " Hi Carlie, hope you're feeling ok. I'm ok, I do get moments of anxiety, but think I'm coping alright. I've been overwhelmed with the amount of love and support I'm getting from my family, friends and colleagues and I think that this is helping a lot.  I can understand your anger with your GP, that is disgusting.  The photoshoot is with the medical photographers - sounds more glamorous calling it a photoshoot lol. My surgeon asked for my consent to have them done. The one today is the before surgery one, I will then have one done after the mastectomy and reconstruction and a final one after surgery on my other breast. A copy goes into my medical files and the photos are also used for teaching purposes and sometimes publication. I might ask them if I can have copies lol. Yesterday I did my 'hospital' shopping and did get a bit stressed over which bra to get. I've been told by my bcn to get a sports bra, I ended up buying 3 different types, just hope at least one is right. Most of the time I feel quite relaxed about it all,  but I know I'll feel different next week eeeek! Ann xx",

      "Content": "Hi Carlie, I have also recently been diagnosed and having a mastectomy and reconstruction on the 14th October. Like you I'm going through a wide range of emotions, but trying to stay positive - I've always been a very optimistic person, but must admit this is testing me. Like Grogg says I'm finding the waiting the worst thing, just want to get it over and done with and find out what further treatment is needed so that can be dealt with too. On a lighter note I've booked my holiday for September 2016 so here's hoping. Xx ",

      "Content": "Hi Carlie, sorry to hear you had a rough day but hope you are still feeling better.  I have no lump as such, but an area of DCIS just behind my nipple and an area of lobular cancer further back so a mastectomy was my only choice. I've been for a bone density scan today as the medication I'm on, anastrozole, can affect the bones - it was good to find out that my bone density is above average for my age group something good at last!  Tomorrow I'm going for my 'before' photoshoot, are you having photos taken?  Not long now until you get your biopsy results, the waiting is awful isn't it?  I wish my op was tomorrow instead of next Wednesday, just want it over and done with now. Stay strong, Ann xx",

      "Content": "Hi Carlie, great news about the biopsy. I've also got to have the sn biopsy and have got my fingers and everything else crossed for both of us.  Unfortunately I couldn't have copies of my photoshoot, but I'm going to do one of my own at home lol.  I don't know what grade mine is the surgeon said he wouldn't know until after the surgery, but it is dcis and lobular, oestrogen positive and HER2 negative. I do think that the more information you have the better you feel. Will be thinking of you Tuesday- in between the panic attacks lol - and I'm sure we will both be fine.  Just keep thinking about the new perky breasts we are going to have when it's all over lol.  Ann xx   ",

Felt a bit down today, dont know why, so treated myself to a pj day - I've done absolutely nothing lol, but I'll be up and running again tomorrow.  Hope you've had a good day. Like you say chatting on here has really helped me too, my friends and family are great but it definitely helps talking to someone who is going through the same thing. Hugs, Ann xx",
