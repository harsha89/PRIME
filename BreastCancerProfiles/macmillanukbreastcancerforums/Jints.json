      "Content": "Hi I have just completed my radiotherapy 13 days ago and the tiredness is awful.  I have no energy whatsoever and just want to sleep all the time.  I am sleeping 12 hours every night and still need to nap during the day too.  The other side effects I can cope with but the tiredness is so bad that I actually feel worse now than I did throughout the whole BC journey including WLI, Infection, 2nd op.  Has anyone else experienced this?  My Radiotherapist and BC nurse both told me that the radiotherapy would peak approx. 3 weeks after treatment which means this could get worse!!!  Not one for feeling sorry for myself but I could honestly sit and cry when I feel that I should be jumping for joy as my treatment has ended.  Anyone else experienced this??   Jints",

      "Content": "Hi there,  I have just finished my radiotherapy and can empathise with the tiredness.  My radiologist told me that the tiredness and other side effects would peak aprox 3 weeks after the last session as the radiation continues to work for this amount of time.  I am now 12 days post treatment and can definitely say that I am exhausted.  I am sleeping 12 hours every night and also having a nap when possible during the day.  Other side effects I have experienced are my breast feels like it has prickly heat and I have a burn like blister on my nipple which I now have medication for.  My senses of taste and smell have also been affected but I have been informed that this will return to normal in a few weeks.  The treatment itself was painless and quick and the radiography team at the Edinburgh Cancer centre were absolutely fantastic.  I had to stay away from home during the treatment  as it is too far to travel on a daily basis and I found this the hardest part of the treatment.  If there is a Maggies Centre available please use it as I found the support workers a great sense of support during this time.  They honestly are fantastic.  I have only just joined this group as I have never felt able to talk about breast cancer before now.  It is amazing how we cope each day when all we can think of cancer, cancer cancer.   Thanks for listening and good luck to all of you.  xxx   Jints",

      "Content": "Hopefully you will get some info from other members on this site re medication or lack of it.  I remember well the feelings of panic, scared and disbelief and the only piece of advice I can offer is to take one day at a time.  Aim for your 1st hurdle which is the lumpectomy then start thinking about the next part.  I think I cried for 2 weeks non stop but by the time I got the results of my lumpectomy I had managed to get my head around it and was determined to beat it.  I was so scared though and it is only now I feel able to talk about it.  It is normal to feel scared and you have  all kinds of thoughts running through your head but once you get your results and you know what your treatment plan is going to be you will be able to think more positively.    Good luck Anna and let me know how you get on. xxxxxx   Jints  ",

      "Content": "Hi Anna   I was the same as you with a lumpectomy, radiotherapy and I have to take Tamoxifen for 5 years.  I`m not sure but I think it depends on your age as to what, if any drugs are used.  I am 52 and had already started having menopausal symptoms before I was diagnosed.  The Tamoxifen brings on the menopause but not sure if other drugs are prescribed for younger people. Maybe other members could tell you that.  I hope you are remaining positive and good luck with your op and radiotherapy. xxxxx   Jints",
