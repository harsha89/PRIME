      "Content": "Hi Mimi You are so right and I'm sure it's just a matter of time. I have learnt quite a bit about myself over the last few months and I need to keep going. I never ever thought that some 'friends' could be so insensitive and others be so much more. You do discover your true friends and they will be more special to me for ever. They say rest is a good healer and I have been told so many times to be kinder to myself, so I am going to do that and look forward to a wonderful new year ahead. Thank you!! I know now more than ever that keeping things locked in your head is not good and sharing your thoughts is much healthier. I AM LUCKY and I will get stronger. I hope you will too.  Alison x",

      "Content": "Hi Vicki You sound like an amazing lady THANK YOU SO MUCH for sharing your story with me. Your journey is an inspiration and I cannot even imagine how you managed with 'children' attached. Thankfully my sons are grown up now, but we are very close and I know how difficult it was for them to take this in. I held it together at the beginning for them and my husband as I have always been the one who keeps the wheels in motion. It is NOW that my emotions have gone wonky and some days I have to sit myself down and say this is serious and has been a huge shock to the system. I often can't believe it and I think it's all a dream.I am trying to be kind to myself and I will continue to do so everyday and will not be afraid to ask for help. A friend told me at the beginning of all this that the important thing is to take one day at a time. That helped. I will remember your story on my journey to recovery - our children are everything and I am so happy you got through it. I will too it just takes time. With very best wishes, Alison XX  ",

      "Content": "Is this normal? I was diagnosed in August following my 1st screening appointment. It came from nowhere and it was such a shock. I am usually so matter of fact about things but this has hit me so much harder than I expected. I held it all back at the beginning as my two sons came up for a visit from London and Liverpool (to Edinburgh) and I didn't want them see me fall apart. The surgery (lumpectomy) was a success and cancer removed. I am now half way through R.T. and just don't feel good. The tireness has kicked in. I understand that this is normal and I'm okay about this. BUT WHY do I feel so guilty. I am one of the lucky ones. I just cannot get my head around it all and my life will never be the same again. My lovely wee breast has changed and I have to take a drug for 5 years. I have wonderful friends, but I don't actually know anyone directly who has been diagnosed with breast cancer in the early stages. I feel terrible and now suffering from anxiety.",

      "Content": "Thanks Kate. I have just found out that there is a group about 15 minutes walk from where I live. I'm going to go along and say hello. Sharing this is so important and great tip about the water - I never drink enough of the stuff at the best of times. We are not alone (thank goodness) with such fantastic support groups around we have to give them a try. With my good wishes, Alison X",
