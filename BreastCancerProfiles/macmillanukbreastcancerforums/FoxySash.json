      "Content": "Hi, I had a lumpectomy and sentinel node removal and had to be in hospital for 7am. I had the nuclear injection/blue dye on that morning, also wires put into my breast which linked up to the titanium marker they put in when I had a scan/mammogram. I had to go back for second incision and more tissue clearance last week but didn't have to have the blue dye again. ",

In the end I just put my tiredness down to the fact I'm travelling backwards and forwards staying at my caravan in Wales where I do a lot of walking, I'm quite active........for my age. Since my cancer op I've felt really well but I'm not looking forward to going back for second incision, but it has to be done so there's no good moaning about it.",

So I have another operation on the 15 th, so it's all been quite a shock and unbelievable as I don't feel unwell. In June this year I felt tired and lethargic and went to Drs and he said it was depression but I just put it down to old age.",

      "Content": "Hi Judith, Thank you for your reply, I was wondering myself if I'd got an infection in my breast as it's very tender to touch and does look inflamed in one area, sort of at the top of my breast from my nipple, it is red. Can't say it's swollen though. Even the GP I saw on Friday said it looked inflamed and I asked if I could have antibiotics and he said no, but I suppose it could be the reason why I'm feeling so lousy. I'll try and make an appointment to see my own GP tomorrow unless the BC nurse rings me first. Thank you ever so much for your reply, thank goodness we have this forum to air our concerns otherwise I'd feel completely left out in the blue.  xxxx❤️",

Finished my 15 sessions of radiotherapy about 3 weeks ago, then last Monday I developed some sort of virus which affected every part of me. Headache cold, aching limbs, diarrhoea and painful breast (lumpectomy one). I don't know whether the pain in my breast is to do with having a virus, tried ringing the BC nurse but she didn't ring me back. I managed to see a a GP (of sorts) on Friday but he was more bothered about my boob being a turquoise colour, even though I told him it was normal as I'd had a nuclear inj for my op. I do feel a bit better today although I wish I could..........sleep Thanks for listening to me moaning on xx ",

My second cup of tea was awful, tasted more like salt water. I'd already got an appointment at Drs last Monday as I'm sure it's a side effect of the drug, but because I've suffered from acid reflux for years I've got to go and have the camera down this Friday. Although it doesn't state this as a side effect of the drug I'm on, on the packet, I have done some research and found that any cancer drug might give you an unpleasant taste in your mouth. Hope this helps although you're taking Tamoxifen xx",

I'm always glad of the weekends off as the round journey to hospital is 60 miles, but yesterday I felt lousy, very lethargic and tired, then today I've got a migraine. I just don't seem to be able to get anything done at home, I'm just glad I haven't a young family to look after. Good luck to everyone else xxxx ",

      "Content": "Hi Kitkat59, I've been taking Anastrozole since the end of November and no real drastic side effects. I get the odd headache now again which might not be due to the drug, Aching bones and limbs, sometimes I feel very irritable and lack patience with people but at the moment I'm feeling stressed out because I start radiotherapy next week every day for 3 weeks. It's not the treatment I'm worried about but the fact that the journey to the hospital and back is 30 miles and I just hate travelling, didn't bother me when I was younger but I'm now 70 and just scares me tbh. Hope that you'll be ok on Anastrozole, I think that whatever cancer drug you take just like any drug there will be some side effects, I suppose it all depends how severe they are. I do get really tired at times but then I did beforehand, trouble is with me when I do feel well I tend to get jobs done and never stop instead of pacing myself out. Good luck with your treatment x",
