Don't worry about being a couch potato, its our body telling us something and we need to listen.  Hope things settle down for you soon. Xx",

      "Content": "Hello Loufil22 I was recalled for another a mammogram because of calcifications in my right breast, they showed me the area on the mammogram and said they are quite often begnine, they can be due to an old injury or infection, this proved to be the case with me as they gave me the all clear on the calcifications. While in was there they also biopsied my left breast as I had some cysts, I have had lumpy breasts all my life and have had two begnine cysts removed.  One of the cysts proved to be cancerous a few months later, the calcifications are going to be checked yearly for any changes to be on the safe side. I hope everything turns out good for you, it's a worrying time, I jumped to all sorts of conclusions during the wait for my results and also during my treatment plan, I made myself miserable, I did have cancer but all of the other things I imagined have not materialised, I'm getting through the treatment and things are looking positive. You'll find lots of friendly people here to ask advice and get moral support from if you need it, it has been invaluable for me to be able to come here.  Again, I hope it all turns out good for you on 25th.

When I was in hospital with the infection just before Christmas I had a blood test when admitted, my levels were high but the nurse doing the test said that it wasn't unusual for people going through chemo and didn't seem worried. Also I'd just taken the steroids and just had the chemo the day before. Ever since then it hasn't been mentioned with all the blood tests so I'm presuming I'm ok now. My Mum was type 1 diabetic and I did have a high reading at the end of my pregnancies. I do hope yours settles down soon. Xx ",

I just couldn't believe it. There's still a long way to go, four more sessions but it's certainly a step in the right direction, and to think a few weeks ago when my mastectomy was cancelled and they said it would chemo first I was absolutely devastated. She even said I may have a smaller operation at the end of it now. Also a huge thank you to everyone here for your encouragement. I really do appreciate it.

My BC nurse said take paracetamol 20 mins before you do them for the first couple of days. My scars are healing really well now all the glue has come away, I'm amazed at how good it all looks so soon after the op.

I'm looking at it like this, When I feel crappy over the next few days, weeks, months, then the cancer cells will be feeling even crappier and thats a good  thing! And when I don't feel crappy, I'll make the most of it. My husband just walked by and  said, big day today...hooter starts the fight back! Made me smile.

I was so shocked at how real the wigs looked when I went to the wig lady, I'm sure I wouldn't be able to tell if someone was wearing one.  I'll probably put mine on wrong though, my husband put a mark on my cycle helmet because I kept putting it on backwards,  I had long hair until about two years ago,then had it cut into a graduated bob, my hair is thick and curly so I was straightening it a lot, so it went to a longish pixie, I'd just got it about right a couple of months ago...oh well never mind.  I am curious to see what will grow back though, my neighbour said you will get chemo curl, and that's all I need on top of curly hair. It'll probably be quite grey too. I don't mind losing it from my private parts, I'd trade that for eyelashes and brows any day. I've been looking on YouTube, there's a lady on there who does amazing eyebrows, I just need to get the pencil and bits, she uses stick on lashes too but I don't think I could use them, but you never know.

I have been writing a blog for the first time ever so that I can look back one day and remind myself that things do indeed get better. They are already  I won't go into huge detail because it's all on there, but I hope I can make you feel a little better by saying that,yesterday I went for my pre chemo meeting with my oncologist. She went into great detail, as I am now having chemotherapy first to try to shrink the tumour before mastectomy, plus it'll treat the whole body at the same time, my tumour is large, 42mm, its grade 3 invasive. But they are very positive of a good outcome.  The scans were a stressful time, they each took longer than they estimated and a couple were done twice. Then on top of that I had to have an MRI on my liver as there was a question mark over it. My mind was in overdrive!   I scared myself silly,  I'd convinced myself that it'd spread, because they put me back in on the bone scan, plus I got a phone call at 5.45pm last Thursday to say my results were in and they needed to see me first thing in the morning for a discussion about the findings. I convinced my self it was the worst case scenario. What a horrendous night! But it was to say that they were changing my treatment plan to chemo first as the tumour was large, but my scans were clear! The tumour is large but has stayed put so far with no evidence yet of lymph node involvement. So I just wanted to say that the time between diagnosis and getting a treatment is the worst, and your imagination will go wild...but take comfort in knowing that they are the experts and are busy getting all the information together during that time so they can treat you in the best way that suits your individual situation. Also if like me, the scans take longer, or they pop you back in again at the end, please don't panic, they are just being thorough.  I hope that helps a little. X",

I won't bore you with my 'story' but I just wanted to say hello, you're not alone in this, I had times where I wanted to give up, thought it was all pointless, too exhausted to think straight, but it's getting better now, little by little, bit by bit, just think that each scan and every appointment gets you nearer to your treatment plan, and further away from the 'not knowing' stage. Better go, the dogs are awake and begging for a wee and breakfast! Xx",

I might just wrap my head up in a scarf tomorrow and collect all the fall out at the end of the day.  I don't care what people think of me either, my husband is the important one, he has to look at me all day, I only see me in the mirror, and I can avoid that to a certain extent. He's not in the least bit bothered either way, but thinks I'd be happier getting the job done if it starts looking more of a mess, he knows me well. Thanks again Tracey, so glad your chemotherapy is over, and in time for Christmas.  Wishing you all the very best for the future. Janette xx",

I went to the shops with my hat on but now I'm back home I've just put a scarf on to catch the loose hair.  I said to my husband , I think I'm going to brave the shave pretty soon,  he said maybe that means I will shave the brave!  It is a strange feeling like you said, I might give it a good brush later and see what's left.  Someone just came to the door and I whipped my scarf off, that's not good, I should've left it on really. Plus my own hair looks such a mess now?  Anyway thanks kacang, it's been interesting hearing how other people found the hair loss experience. I'd better get some jobs done.  Xx",

All I've had really is a slight headache for a day or so, a thick nose feeling. Oh and 'fluffy' gums for a few days. No sickness at all. I told my daughter that my hair was coming out today, she said \"Well at least you know it's doing something Mum.\" It's hard for the husbands isn't it? Mine has been so supportive, he's even been doing some cooking, I could cook, but he seems to be enjoying doing it, he's also been working hard outside, I think to try to keep busy in an attempt  to take his mind of things, I've noticed that he is napping a lot, every time he sits down nearly, I'm sure it's stress, it's a it better the last couple of days though.  I'm hoping tomorrow is a positive day for you jo, do let me know how you get on.

If you are planning the nativity then thats great, I'm so hoping to make the Christmas gathering. Its just a long way from the hospital for me, so Im hoping everything has finished draining by then. I'm with you on the chemo thoughts. I suppose they have to let you settle down a bit after the operation before starting it. I wonder where you take the wig voucher?

I asked the breast care nurse if it would be ok to go to my daughters in London over Christmas (I live in W. Wales) as she is due to have her first baby on 29th Dec, she said most likely it would be fine, I was so relieved, but I had no idea about the drains they leave in, then take out, she said you can get fluid build up after they take out the drains, and have to have it drained out.  I hope I can go. She didn't mention to me about any further treatment before Christmas so I'm guessing that will kick off in the new year. I've been told I will get a wig. I wasn't really expecting to be given a wig, it's very kind to be given one. I hope your meeting with the consultant and your surgery goes well.  Xx",

I felt a lump under my armpit last  night too, that wasn't there yesterday. I felt powerless during this two weeks, I could see it getting bigger, I phoned twice to say this, but it seems that they won't do anything during that time between diagnosis and operating. I suppose they need the scan results first, but it seems so cruel.  The scans were the ct scan and bone scan (with the radioactive fluid) she did a second one on the bones, a 360 degree one. I have grade 3 invasive cancer.  I've had many needle biopsies and VAB's over the last few months, I was told the left breast wasn't a concern, given the all clear at the end of August but told that the right breast needed to be monitored as I have calcium deposits. It's complicated.   Thanks for the reply though, at least I don't have too long to wait now.  Xx",

      "Content": "Hello lacomtkp, It's complicated 'story' I have lots of cysts in my left breast, these were needle biopsied in July, the right breast too. Left breast given the all clear, and right breast had VAB the next month for the calcifications. I was given the all clear in Aughust and told to go back to 3 yearly mammograms, a week later I had a phone call to say that actually they would see me in a year.  I noticed a lump on my left side in September, it felt like fluid, l left it a little while thinking that I'd had the all clear and that it was another  cyst, it got bigger so I went to my gp in October he also thought it was a cyst, but referred me back to the hospital. It was drained and that's when she found a lump underneath. She took 2 needle biopsies and the results came back as grade 3 cancer. The cyst had returned two days after being drained. I was booked in for a mastectomy on 22 Nov. During the next two weeks the 'cyst' got bigger so I phoned the breast care nurse to ask if something needed doing, she said I was probably imagining it and that I was on a treatment plan now and nothing would be done until the operation.  I called again a week later, I was very worried by now, to say it was now painful and uncomfortable it was but perhaps that was the cyst growing, not the cancer, she then dropped the bombshell that I don't have a cyst, it's the cancer. I was devastated. It was still a week to go for the operation at this point. I think I knew then that this wasn't going to be a good outcome. Sorry for the long reply, I got carried away!  Thanks for the cyber hug, and I'll keep you updated. xx",

Has anyone else had this and is this the start of losing my nails? I thought they were doing so well until this.  On the plus side, I'm pretty sure my hair is growing again.

I had my ultrasound today and was relieved to find the lump had shrunk again, I am so silly, I had convinced myself that it had stopped shrinking and even got bigger during the last few days, I have a good imagination and always seem to do this to myself before appointments.  Anyway from 4.2cm originally,  to 2.2cm X 1.1 cm after 2x FEC cycles. Jump forward to today and the  measurements after 3FEC and 1x T cycles were 0.9cm x 0.6cm with two T cycles still to go. To say I was  relieved and absolutely over the moon is an understatement.   She was very pleased and said it's looking like a lumpectomy instead of a mastectomy now, also she arranged the surgery for 4th April... it's my birthday. I've got to go back on 20th March for one more check and to discuss in detail with her what will happen with surgery.  The end of the chemo really does seem in sight now I have the surgery date.  Xx",

I am a fit healthy person ( how ironic) but this last week has knocked me for six, I can go for a year or more without getting a cold, but when I do its usually bad and ends up with sinusitis and it drags on. We live in the countryside in Wales, our business is closed at the moment as its our quiet time anyway, so I won't  be coming in contact with many people next week. I went out yesterday as I am visiting my younger daughter this weekend. I wrapped up, Im taking high dose vit c. and I'm washing my hands all the time. Its one thing trying to prevent catching a cold, but my husband has now said I would be silly to walk into that environment. He doesn't want me to go, but he has to go as he's helping them to move house. I'm not looking forward to being on my own before the op, but its not for long really. We go back to Wales tomorrow. My daughter works in operating theatres so she will probably tell me not to go anyway, she is desperate for me to have the operation done then. Thanks again for the reply.

I was shocked at the news as over the last six months I've been having quite a few investigations with biopsies and they've all come back clear, this lump came up on my left breast, I was told that breast wasn't an issue, it was a cyst again, but large, so they drained it, but then found this lump underneath. Turned out to be cancer. We had our daughter and partner visiting for the weekend so I was kept busy, but since she's gone home the reality is sinking in, waking up at 3am worrying that it has spread as I get pains around the cyst, infact every little twinge is worrying me.  I'm usually the person who is positive, glass is always half full sort, but this has knocked me sideways. But I have become a good actor since Friday, no one would know what's going on inside my head by looking at me. Anyway it's Pre op tomorrow, bone scan, CT scan...oh how life can change in a heartbeat. We were due to start a two week holiday tomorrow. Anyway I decided to join Macmillan, most unlike me as I'm quite a private person, plus rubbish at technology, but I thought everyone on here sounded so lovely and honest so it wouldn't harm. I don't want to take up my lovely husbands offer to wake him up if I can't sleep, no point us both being tired. I hope I've done this right. Apologies for rambling on. JMC04",

My husband and I saw the breast care nurse today, before the pre op,  she was great and made us both feel much better. I'd had a mini melt down in the TK max car park, only lasted two minutes, my first tears since being diagnosed, what a place to have them!

      "Content": "Hello,  Oh my goodness, poor you, what awfully bad luck, both of you getting this terrible disease! I hope those side effects wear off soon. I'm not sure what to do when and if the time comes about a breast reconstruction, the consultant said she'd discuss it at a later date. Problem being that my other breast, the right breast has calcification in it. They say that's not a concern at the moment, just needs watching for changes. My daughter is in the medical profession and works in the operating theatres has asked me to consider having the other side taken away later as she doesn't want me worrying about that side too, I think she is desperate for anything dodgy to go. I can't pull the wool over her eyes or make it sound better than it is for her sake. (She's expecting her first baby in December and I didn't want her worrying) she knows the procedure with bone scan ct scan etc.  I guess I will wait and see how well this turns out first and how I feel and if its spread or not. Stage 3 sounds scary to me right now! What is FEC-D? Sorry but I don't know much about the after treatment, seems so many different types. The consultant mentioned chemo and radiation I think, I wasn't really taking it all in.  Think I'll find out more at the pre op tomorrow. If you want to chat in the early hours and I'm on here feel free to say hello, I think my nights are going to be very different for a while.  I have no friends on here yet and am trying to get the hang of how it all works.

      "Content": "Hello Carolyn, Well, you asked what inspired all the biopsies, are you ready, here we go. Similar to you really, I've had Breast cysts for many years, with two begin lumps operated on and removed, had a call up for my 50th year mammograms in June. I told my hubby that I didn't want to go, that it would be 'opening up a can of worms'...boy was I right!  I got a recall letter 10 days later, appointment at breast care on July 6th. This resulted in I think (I lost count) about 12 needle biopsies, both sides. The results came in on 8 July as left breast OK but inconclusive on breast calcification on the right side, so back to have VAB on 2nd August quite a few, I was told this VAB would only be one needle and would be easier than the last lot, but it wasn't, it was very painful and they did loads. It took until 26 August to get the results and many phone calls, I got the all clear that day and was told 3 yearly checks would be fine. I would get a letter stating this, I never got the letter so started phoning to see why I hadn't got it, but then I had a lump come up on the left breast, which was the one they weren't concerned with, I left it for a month before seeing the GP (Oct 13)as they hadn't been concerned about the lumps in the left side I thought it'd just be another begnine cyst, when it started to get big I thought I'd better go. So it was a referral back to the hospital last Monday and the cyst was drained with loads of clear fluid removed, she seemed pleased and I was so relieved ...but then she ultrasounded the area again and that was when the lump underneath the cyst showed up, she looked back at the mammograms from June/July and she thought it wasn't present then, two more needle biopsies into the lump and then on Friday when getting the results the awful news came that it was indeed cancer, grade3 an invasive type. That's how I got here. Long story, sorry. On the sleep side of things, I have some very mild sleeping tablets from a while ago, I only took a few then and have some left, but I don't want to go down that route yet if I can help it, but sleep makes things so much easier to cope with so I might give in. Oh you did make me smile when you said your husband woke you up to make sure you were ok.  Blimey though it sounds like you've been through it all. If only we could go back do things differently hey? I wouldn't have waited so long to go back with this last lump. Hindsight is a wonderful thing.  Janette, xx",

      "Content": "Hello again Carolyn, I've been thinking a lot about reasons for cancer at this time of life. I've always been prone to breast changes around my period, I had a break of 3 months this year May, June, July with no periods, I thought oh well, here we go, it's the start of the menopause, actually wanted to get it over with, no more lumpy painful boobs every month, during that 3 months they were much better, I slept better, then in August I had a period, very heavy, then two weeks later another one, then in September a period, my last period was October 5th, so they may be stopping again as I'm a week late now, with no sign of anything. Is it hormones with me, that's what I'm asking myself. About the reconstruction I think she did mention radiotherapy, but it was all a bit of a blur but  she said we could discuss reconstruction at a later date. She did also say she could just remove the lump and surrounding tissue if I really wanted, but wouldn't be really happy with that because of my lumpy history. I think she's a 'belt and braces' approach type of person.  I will ask  tomorrow what sort of cancer it is.  I took your advice and have ignored the housework.  Janette xx",

I've always kept fit, ran a 5k park run with my daughter a month ago and wasn't far behind her. Isn't that ironic? I've always been careful with my diet and weight, now I feel like it's been all for nothing. It's the scans next week I'm dreading.   Today I'm feeling a little tearful, and weary, I don't know why because I haven't even cried yet, plus we are taking a last chance before the op to visit family in Devon over the weekend, leaving tomorrow, I should be happy. I need to find my 'actors hat' and put it on I think. This is exactly how I felt ten years ago after my mum died. Anyway thanks for the positivity, very much appreciated right now. Xx",

After the pre op tomorrow we are going to pack up and go to see my daughter and parents in law on Thursday in Devon, back on Monday, I just can't stand the thought of sitting here waiting and worrying. Got Ct scan Tuesday, bone scan Wednesday, then the final few days till admission to the hospital on Monday. I never thought I'd be looking forward to a mastectomy that's for sure, but I just want it over and done with now. I've kind of convinced myself that it's spread as it's so uncomfortable and the cyst is really big now but there's nothing at all I can do about it. I only joined Macmillan today and I'm glad I did, I've seen that even if the worst happens and it has spread, there are good treatments and it sounds like people still have a good quality of life, I have my first grandchild due in December and am desperate to see him grow up as much as I can, so I'm clinging on to anything that will give me hope right now.  My husband said yesterday that this life changing news has created a new 'normal' the last 50 years of normal have gone, the new normal is hospital appointments and hoping for the best. He was right I think. I hope you get your operation on Friday and that this time it works out for you. I've started taking vit c today because I have a tickly throat and I just couldn't bear it if the operation was cancelled, I don't know if it works but I don't suppose it can harm. Wishing you  all the very best for Friday. Xx  ",

Its early days but so far so good, today has been the best day since this nightmare began, I keep telling myself that everything will be ok, over and over again when I start to panic.  I think starting the chemo, although daunting was a huge relief to me, and my husband. I got lots of cards from people when they heard the news, but one of my good friends sent me a really beautiful but simple card, one with those words on the front, 'Everything will be OK' I've put away all the other cards in a box with all the appointments and paperwork, because I need to move forward now, but that card is sitting on the book case, reminding me that 'everything will be ok.'  Apart from a soreish mouth over the last couple of days physically I feel ok. I diluted a teaspoon of salt in a pint of water and have been gently swilling my mouth out with that during the day and after I eat. It seems to be doing the trick.  It's going to be ok Jo.  Xxx",

I just keep hearing the breast care nurse saying the left breast isn't a concern....look at me now.  How are you jo?  Xxx",

I can't quite say goodbye to the chemo club yet as you've all been such a fantastic help. I don't post too much but I do a lot of reading.  I'm almost back to normal three weeks after the last dose, the watery twitchy eyes are still annoying me, but apart from that I feel fine. Energy levels good, taste buds firing on all cylinders and I'm looking forward to eating all the things on the 'danger' list next week.  So the next bit begins now, I'm going into hospital Monday, operation Tuesday. For anyone just starting chemo, I found it completely doable and not half as bad as I thought it would be, I know everyone is different but apart from a few days I just carried on almost as normal and carried on working. I had one infection after the second FEC which I'm sure was a lady sneezing and coughing on me as I walked inside a shop, but the hospital dealt with it so well and I was home again in a couple of days. It was all fine after that.  So good luck and all the very best to everyone in the April chemo club.  Xx",

With having triple negative breast cancer I was advised to have the chemotherapy first before surgery as it can respond excellently to the chemo and shrink the tumour dramatically. In my case I was very lucky to have a pCR, meaning all traces of cancer had gone by the time of the lumpectomy. I'm sure there someone here will help you with some information on the onoctype test soon.  I had my treatment plan changed at the last minute and found really stressful, it was hard to accept what the experts were telling me at the time, but they really are going to do what's right and best for you.
