      "Content": "Hi Lorraine, Before chemo I had dead straight naturally blonde hair after chemo it came back grey and very curly, I was delighted, it was thicker than it had ever been before and the novelty of not having to \"faff\" with my hair every morning was great. I am now 10 months down the line and my curls have gone!  I couldn't face having to wash and hot brush it every day again so I have had it permed and I am a very happy bunny!",
