    "Content": "Hi I read your post and instantly reminded me what my mum was and still is going through. We waited a while for appointments she had similar anxiety about the appointments. She had grade 3 invasive breast cancer which was hormone positive type HER2. She had a lumpectomy and now just had first session of chemo. Strangely we felt a better after the surgery although things are still up and down. We going to ask the GP to refer us to a Macmillan nurse. We found Macmillan centre at our hospital very useful , they have groups which you can join and talk about your feelings with someone who understands. I hope you find the support you need. X",
