I have a friend who is receiving the exact same treatment and she is the same. Although she lost her hair after the second one I have still got mine although it is thinning.",

      "Content": "Hi Chris I have secondaries in my liver have been receiving taxol weekly for the last eight weeks and have another three to have. I am doing ok. I wish your sister all the best. They cannot cure it but the aim is to keep it under control. I started with breast cancer in 2000 then it went to my bones in 2005 and in september of this year to my liver, I have survived for nine years and I intend surviving for another nine at least. All you can do is Have a positive attitude take what ever treatment is needed to keep you going and always remember you are not dying from it you are living with it. Cheers and all the best",
