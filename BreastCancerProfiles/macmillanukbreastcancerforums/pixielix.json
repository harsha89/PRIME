      "Content": "Heather did you see a post by Balletbird about Sandoz, also being made by Novartis and having the same ingredients? I have just been told that I won't be getting Femara after all (despite several consultants and my doctor agreeing initially but not ever having given me a prescription for the hrand). ive waited for several months and refused the generic brands 'just for the time being, while we sort it out' on the basis that, in the end I'd get it. I was wrong!  My GP is taking to the local clinical advisory but, given the diff in costs I hold out no hope whatsoever. In that event, it seems to be either, a case of 'bite the bullet' or snake oil in the faint hope it works. So, having read the post as per above I am considering asking for the Sandoz to see how that goes.    ",
