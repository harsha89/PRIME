      "Content": "Hi Flower, in regards to my mother, yes she is my mother and yes, she probably is scared.  She nursed all four of my grandparents through cancer and so I wrongly assumed she would be sympathetic and indeed empathetic.  However, it was proven not to be the case.  While going through RCHOP and having horrible side effects she made everything about her.  My son was living alone in her house at the time and indeed himself coming to terms with my diagnosis and treatment.  She lived with her partner in his house.  She wanted to throw my son out onto the streets in January of this year.  I pleaded with her not to while I was going through chemo as the stress of having him on the streets in another country was too much for me.  She said she wouldn't do it.  Within 24 hours she changed her mind and threw him out.  I wrote her a 7 page letter and have had no appology for her actions.  She replied that as my last chemo was to be 14 February I should be back to 'normal' by the end of February!  Here we are in September and I would not say I am back to 'normal'.  There is more to this story but for the time being, no contact with my 'drama' mother is best for me so I can concentrate on my recovery.  Cancer certainly helps to reevaluate your whole life and indeed relationships.  I am fed up with dealing with unreasonable people and indeed now refuse to.  Life is too short :)  wishing you a beautiful day.  san x",

      "Content": "Hi Flower I'm a great believer in that life delivers things to you at the right time :).  Maybe you are 'tuned' into these things and that's why you have noticed them.  I think it's great there are so many 'cancer' storylines at the moment in the soaps and the adverts, as so many people are affected.  It's not an easy subject for people to get their heads around and this is one good way to raise awareness.  I have, quite spectacularly, fallen out with my mother during my treatment, and when I see these storylines I hope she is watching them and getting an understanding of what I am going through.  Wishing you the best on your journey.  San x",
