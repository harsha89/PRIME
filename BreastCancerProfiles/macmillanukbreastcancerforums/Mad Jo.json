      "Content": "Hi, Jan, I had Taxotere & Herceptin after liver diagnosis. Tumours didn't grow any bigger & are still the same after 2 years. I'm still on Herceptin. Big worry now is brain tumour. Did you have anything like radiotherapy or surgery for that? I've been told mine is treatable, but don't know yet what they will offer. Bit terrified at the moment. You're not alone, although I know it can feel like that at times. See the oncologist asap & let me know how you get on. May X",
