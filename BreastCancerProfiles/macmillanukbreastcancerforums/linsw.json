It\u2019s hit me hard straightaway -within a few hours of getting home..headaches, terrible nausea despite the meds and fluey feeling. Sofa day yesterday and just up after a day in bed snoozing - can barely keep my eyes open - but need to head out with kids to watch fireworks and inhale some wintery air!!! Felt fairly flat for me today - but still feel strong mentally - and it looks like im on your yesterday- so should be brighter tomorrow - today ive just taken advantage of it being a saturday and my partner being amazing as ever nipping in tea and cold dtinks and trying to find things i\u2019ll eat! Thats proving difficult!  I did cold cap - but im indifferent to the whole thing - the chemo nurses were judt so positive and telling me there is nothing to loose - give it a go - so i did - but im not prepared with wigs as i only found out chemo was coming on monday and so i\u2019d better get going next week!!  One thing im finding bothersome is my mastectomy scar and skin on my chest is sore-supersensitive stingy?!  Not long now Anna - you\u2019ll be fine - we are xxxx  Big hugs xxx ",

      "Content": "Hi all, I am due to have my left boob taken off on tuesday. It's all been so quick that im more than a bit nervous i must admit! I have been told that the combination of big lump and small boobs means that a lumpectomy would not be possible. I have known this for a few weeks now but have been waiting for tests to confirm node involvement etc and some baffling stuff around my lump (the one i found) dissapearing after biopsy (it was 2cm)... so asked if chemo first then surgery was an option - as id obviously convinced myself that i was miraculously healing/curing myself!!!! Medical professionalism dealt with my thoughts with a smile and quickly moved on to explain that because i have micro mets in the tested node and the vanishing lump was below the node this indicates this stage 3 Her + bulls**t is on the move. Im happy to have my boob removed - and will have sentinel node removal at the same time.  I'm really scared of having a op though! Never had one-no desire to be knocked out - i really am the ultimate control freak and this cancer business is pressing all the wrong buttons in that respect!! Lol!  Reconstruction has not been offered as an option atall for me - not until treatment has finished - i think that makes sense and i'm not sure i'll be up for it in the end as the way i feel about 1 operation is bad enough.  kacang - i fancied a knitted knocker too - im so small and skinny i just want something to fill the otherdidevof an already padded bra! Where did you get it?!  I am sooooo pleased i found this site - from the moment i posted about my worry about how long i'd have to wait after finding a lump to seeing the breast clinic (which incidently was originally booked for the day after im now due to have my surgery!) i was given such amazing advice - talked through what to expect at the clinic in such a sensitive and comprehensive way that i felt in control (did i mention that's important to me!!) and my anxiety was barely noticeable!  What im trying to say is a big thankyou - the admiration and respect i have for folk on here - the way posts and concerns are handled is awesome! Fab bunch in a shi*ty position ... but still fightling !!!!  Xxxxxxxx  ",

I was told that the lumps I had were likely to be fibroid(something) and biopsys were taken just to be sure - so when I went back last week to get my results I was so shocked to be given the news. I had been so sure it was cancer then talked myself out of it completely after my visit to the clinic. So what I'm saying is try to remain open minded and realistic - most lumps and bumps are not nasty but some are-it is an emotional rollercoaster and its so easy to get caught up in!! X",
