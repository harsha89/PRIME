Before cancer I used Neutrogena T/Gel most of the time as I suffered from a flaky scalp. Now every time I touch my hair, it snows lol (lots of dandruff) Is it safe to use the T/Gel again?

Don't really know the answer to your question but wouldn't think there would be many as we're not long after treatment. Saying that I was terrified and told my surgeon. I even had pains in my breast and shoulder blade. The surgeon had a feel and said he wasn't worried. Then I had to suffer the mammogram. So I think because I was so worried and  tense I was causing the pain. I am sure we will be both ok, just maybe find ways to relax although it's easier said than done. Take Care. Jo x",

I keep thinking that this time in two weeks time I will be a bit better and the radiotherapy is not going to be half as bad.I didn't feel like this on the first three. In fact I took a blood retest on the day after on one just so there wouldn't be a delay. Maybe if I was supported a bit from family and friends it would help:(  Jo x",

It's either pain, diarrhoea or constipation as well as mouth ulcers. I don't get on during the steroids either and can't eat during that time. Also felt dizzy at the top of the stairs. I felt very vulnerable. Doesn't help that I am totally on my own. I'm HER2 positive and only had a tiny lump in my breast. Do I go through with the 6th treatment on Thursday and put myself in danger or should I go straight onto the radiotherapy? I'm also on herceptin. Jo",

The Oncologist is going to have a chat with me then. It will be a case of knock it all on the head chemo wise or a weeks break. The nurse did say that the letrozole and the herceptin were the most important parts which make me wonder what all the pain and the loss of hair was for?? As for the getting friends to take me to radiotherapy Bryony, I have been let down by my friends at work apart from one. It's been a long and lonely journey for me. Jo x",

Alot of the pain is coming from the injections to boost the white cells but I'm not allowed to stop them. So I take painkillers, this causes constipation and then the diarrhoea starts.
