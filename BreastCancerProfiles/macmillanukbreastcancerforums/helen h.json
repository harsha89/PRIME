Had a very rude young nurse who had me in tears . Only one lymph node taken so haven't spread , but am rather sore and some pain under arm . My blood pressure was low on my going home from the hospital , and I keep going very light headed and dizzy . Don't know if I'm meant to get it checked or not . Going back on the 16th to get the results , then depending on them will start chemo .",
