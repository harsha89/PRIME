      "Content": "no, angela, neither had I ..   I think this is mainly because its an expense on NHS..    as I understand it, you have to go to lymph clinic and nurse bandages the whole arm, and you have to keep it dry and go back to clinic every 2 days to get it re-done. if you enter  \"bandaging to arm for lymphoedema\"  plenty of websites explaining about it. I wish us ladies had all info and options given to us  pam",

      "Content": "hello, thank you had breast cancer 2014 - all lymph nodes removed.   lymphoedema started a couple of years after masectomy. yes, for a long time been wearing compression ,  but it was only recently my lymp nurse suggested that bandaging may help.   (wish these people would advice you on procedures early on !!!). I believe that because I have absolutely no lymh nodes left, that it can never be cured.     but, next time I visit nurse, I will go into it in more details. thanks pam",

      "Content": "hello thank you for reply. when I first started with lympho,  it was following a fall I had,  and I presumed the fall was just my arm swelling up because of this !!   only after a few weeks did I go to doc who sent me for a \"dopplar\" test  and it was diagnosed as lymphoedema.     then, referred to my local hospice where they have nurses showing you exercises, etc.   followed by  compression garments,  which I do wear. it was only after my last visit to nurse that she mentioned maybe bandaging could help - but also talked about expense to NHS, etc !!   I shall ask her about it in May. just interested in ladies views on this bandaging, as I know it means going back to the hospice quite regularly for this bandaging (not that its a real problem,  but it does involve a 40 mile round trip. thanks  pam",
