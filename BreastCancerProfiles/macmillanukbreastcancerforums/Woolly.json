      "Content": "Hi all, Was finally diagnosed last week with stage 2 bc, relieved i finally know what it is and totally shocked that i have it  will be having a mastectomy after easter but not to have reconstruction until a later date which is worrying me a bit. This alone is making me anxious and making me overthink things, ie has it spread, are they expecting it to spread!  When i was told i had bc i couldnt really take it all in, my designated nurse to chat to is on holiday and i dont want to bother the dr with questions.  I feel im putting a brave face on for family members and friends who ask if im feeling ok, my answer,  yes feeling fine, when im actually feeling overwhelmed with a mixture of emotions, is this normal?  Also bc in left breast and nodes but am feeling pain under right arm also  ",
