      "Content": "thanks nutcracker or may i call u ann.  your post made me feel quite positive about my mortgage and i plan to contact my mortgage provider and see if there is anything they can do to help me.  my onco is lovely and has answered all the questions ive asked her, i have appts for a abdo ct scan on monday and a bone scan on wed of next week so things are beginning to happen so hopefully by the end of the month i will b all clued up as to whats going to happen.  i do believe that the uncertainty is worse than the diagnosis but i dont suppose anyone has a crystal ball to see whats goin to happen in the future ( id be a millionaire by now if i did )  i just know that the support of my family, friends and my new friends in the online community will help me through the dark days.  i will keep everyone posted as to whats happening and thank you for your advice joan x",

      "Content": "hi all. i am new to the website ( only because im a technophobe) and have just been diagnosed wiith secondary breast cancer.  i developed breast cancer 12 years ago and had a mastectomy followed by chemo and radiotherapy, i came out the other side feeling fitter than i had ever done before so to be told the cancer has returned was like being told id lost the winning lottery ticket.  all the emotions of old have come flooding back but this time i think they are even stronger.  At the moment im in limbo waiting to find out what treatment is best for me but for some unknown reason i feel like such a failure and that im letting everyone down is this a normal feeling.  what really worries me the most is the financial burden this has left us with.  thngs were tight before now there strangling me.  i feel like im being punished twice.  ive always been a chilled laid back type of person and am trying so hard to be positive but sometimes its really hard when it all seems to stack up against you.  i might be in the third division today but hopefully its premiership here i come .",
