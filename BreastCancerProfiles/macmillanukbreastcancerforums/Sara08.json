      "Content": "Hi Ida Many thanks for your message. I\u2019ve been told how rare occult breast cancer is so it\u2019s very good to hear that you\u2019re doing well and all clear.  I have finished chemo - in fact I was so ill with my last cycle in February that the oncologist agreed that I could skip the final planned cycle. My scans after 6 cycles were good and I had surgery just over a week ago - the same as you, axillary node clearance on the left side.  I\u2019ve tried to stay positive all the way through but I\u2019ve had some desperate days, I must admit. My main issue is that feeling, just like you say .... it must be somewhere else in my body. My scans were all clear though, so I know it\u2019s not rational .... except that I never would have known I had this without a very good routine mammogram w.hen I hit 53! The lymph node initially identified was right up against my chest wall, so it was hidden deep within my breast, with no outward signs at all.  Scary really, as even for surgery last week it had to be \u2018tagged\u2019 first with a clip, then a wire, backed up by further mammograms, so that the surgeon made sure he got it. I have a great team of breast care nurses, oncologists, surgeons, etc so I\u2019m confident that I\u2019ve had the best possible treatment. I get my histology results next week, then it\u2019s radiotherapy and probably Tamoxifen to follow.  I\u2019m trying to take this one step at a time but I can\u2019t help having that nagging worry in my mind that I was lucky this was even picked up. I\u2019m told there\u2019s very little research about occult breast cancer. My surgeon reassures me that the axillary node clearance will do the job, and that women who\u2019ve had the same treatment have done very well, so I\u2019m incredibly pleased that you got in touch and are proving her right!! I\u2019m glad to say I appear to be healing up well, although it\u2019s all still pretty sore of course. The best thing is that I\u2019m able to eat properly again! Like you I ate whatever took my fancy during chemo, including rather too many chocolate biscuits ...  I\u2019m trying to eat healthy meals again now, as otherwise I\u2019ll turn into a blob!  Many thanks again for your encouraging words.  Sara",

It\u2019s the latest change of chemo that\u2019s floored me but I\u2019m hanging in there trying to remind myself that it\u2019s temporary and I\u2019ll have finished all treatment by the summer! I don\u2019t know what will happen after that but Tamoxifen has been mentioned. Hope your chemo goes ok. ",

      "Content": "Hi After a routine mammogram (I\u2019m 53) I was diagnosed with primary occult breast cancer on Friday 13th October last year. I\u2019m told that breast cancer appears like this rarely - in about 0.1% of patients. Basically I have several enlarged lymph nodes with the largest about 10mm, which I\u2019m told is \u2018not big\u2019. I had every test and scan going but there are no tumours in my breast at all. I\u2019ve had 3 cycles of Taxol (Paclitaxel) but had to skip the 4th as I had such bad problems with my hands and feet. So I had my first EC Therapy last week and since then I\u2019ve felt awful. Just wiped out with nausea and fatigue, plus now I\u2019m feeling shaky all the time. I\u2019m normally the sort of person rushing about, never sitting still, and I have a teenage son with mobility difficulties who I look after. So sitting around doing nothing is weird for me. My boss has been great (I teach Law one night a week) and even though I\u2019ve done work from home for cover tutors I\u2019m desperate to get back to teaching. I just don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to manage on the new chemo and feel like I\u2019m letting my students down.  After chemo (3 more EC planned!) I\u2019m up for axillary node clearance, then radiotherapy. Frankly I don\u2019t know what to dread more - the ongoing nausea or the surgery?! I have great family and friends, a husband who is holding it all together for all of us, and a fab medical team, so I feel lucky. I try to pick out the positives/silver linings in everything to do with this rollercoaster journey BUT I still feel alone plus I have days like today where I\u2019m not holding it my s**t together at all!  So I\u2019m just reaching out to anyone out there who feels the same, or who has come across occult breast cancer, or who has advice or thoughts to share! Thanks. ",

      "Content": "Hi Our journeys sound very similar  - I was diagnosed a year ago (Fri 13th!) due to one enlarged lymph node near my chest wall, so it was buried pretty deep. I had no visible signs at all of cancer, and no tumours. I had chemo, then axillary node clearance (10 out of 18 had cancer in, so similar proportions), then radiotherapy. I\u2019m having similar issues with Letrozole but I\u2019ve just started acupuncture to try to help with sweats, aches and insomnia, as my oncologist said it\u2019s helped some other women. I\u2019m also taking sage tablets again, which I was taking pre-cancer for menopausal symptoms!! MRI is due soon and mammogram is all done, so it\u2019s just waiting for results now. I did opt for the biophosphonates as frankly I\u2019ll grab on to anything that might help and we have a family history of osteoporosis so I\u2019m concerned about that too. However, in your shoes I probably would have said no. ",

      "Content": "Thanks Deb I had my 4th chemo last Tuesday. The first 3 were reasonably manageable but they changed me to EC therapy last week and I\u2019ve had a bad time with nausea. However, I\u2019ve been told, and as usual I didn\u2019t pay proper attention, that everyone is affected differently. I waited far too long to get help with the nausea and ended up back at hospital today on fluids and new anti-emetics. Some people have worse side effects than others, some have very few. We are all different and the oncologists will help and try to personalise your treatment and medication to suit. Chemo can be hard but you need to ask for help if it gets tough. My friend keeps telling me that it\u2019s killing off the sneaky cancer so it\u2019s doing me good. Not always easy to remember, I know, but hopefully you won\u2019t have too much trouble with side effects! Good luck with it all. We\u2019re in this together so come back with your news!! X ",

Obviously I have the odd wobble but the breast clinic always check me out and support me. Just had my first mammogram and I\u2019m due an MRI aswell because I\u2019m so unusual- fingers crossed!!! It\u2019s good to know I\u2019m not alone, so I hope you continue to do well. Thanks for getting in touch. ",

      "Content": "Hi Having read these posts I finally feel I\u2019m not alone. I was diagnosed with primary occult breast cancer on Friday 13th October - really you couldn\u2019t make it up. This means it has metastasised into my lymph glands but they can\u2019t find a primary tumour. Literally it\u2019s not appearing anywhere. This all came from a routine mammogram. I\u2019ve had all the tests and it hasnt spread although there\u2019s something in my lung so small they can\u2019t identify. A second breast biopsy last week may reveal more this week but it\u2019s been a waiting game and the uncertainty is awful. The first two weeks were the hardest. I\u2019m trying to laugh and joke about it but I still don\u2019t have a treatment plan. Chemo looks like a certainty but the rest isn\u2019t confirmed yet.  My husband has truly stepped up. Plus my two children have been great. I\u2019m only just able to talk without crying though. My best friend has been through all this and come out the other end fit and well but it\u2019s so hard to put it to the back of your mind. Does everyone else wake up thinking about it?? ",

My breast care nurse has been doing her job for 10 years and said she\u2019s only had 2 women with occult breast cancer. My consultant was the same. The only up side seems to be that it\u2019s clearance of lymph nodes and not mastectomy! I am told that results are just as good without mastectomy so they won\u2019t suggest that unless something nasty surprises us all. I don\u2019t know yet whether mine is oestrogen based or genetic but my mum had breast cancer 34 years ago so they\u2019ll do the test soon. When do you start chemo? I\u2019m having chemo first then surgery later. Good luck with it all. I hope you have lots of support around you x ",

      "Content": "Thanks for your reply ronstar. I saw my consultant and her amazing team yesterday. They gave me options but we agreed with their recommendation- chemo, then surgery, then radiotherapy. I have the rather rare primary occult breast cancer. It\u2019s in 2 visibly enlarged lymph glands but there\u2019s no visible tumour. The largest one is marked now so that they can monitor the response to chemo (6 lots probably). Surgery may only be stripping out lymph glands and if they shrink that will make surgery less. If any surprises appear then I could still have a mastectomy but that looks unlikely, which is something! Of course I\u2019m not looking forward to it all but having a plan is somehow reassuring. I can joke and laugh most of the time but at night I do sometimes lie awake churning it all over. I\u2019m suffering with anxiety particularly in the mornings, but the breast care nurse said she thought I\u2019d be odd if I wasn\u2019t.  So it\u2019s oncology next week with any luck and then I\u2019ll have more details. We are exhausted with talking about it but I\u2019m fortunate to have a few great friends to walk with me through this journey. ",

      "Content": "Hi There\u2019s not much info available but I was told that only 0.1% of breast cancer patients present as occult. My consultant mentioned an American study involving just over 50 women which started in 1975 and completed I think in 2015 (!). Her point was that mastectomy is not any more effective than lymph node removal - the study showed that in 90% of women with this presentation they did just as well (is no relapse or recurrence) without mastectomy as with it. I\u2019m having chemo first to watch how effective it is on the enlarged nodes, and with the hope of minimising surgery. The study helped the MDT make its recommendations about my treatment apparently. I hope that helps! ",
