    "Content": "Hi, I am in the same boat! Had my op a week ago and follow-up in a few days. They should give me results of lymph node biopsy but am staying positive and hopeful it has not gone that far. The clinic has talked about 3 weeks of daily Radiotherapy and I have no idea what to expect with that - I mean will I lose my hair? Really good to have a place to talk about things as I have a very squeamish husband and son who are very caring but it's not quite the same is it?",
