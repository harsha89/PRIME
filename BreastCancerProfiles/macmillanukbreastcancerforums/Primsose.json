      "Content": "Israel, Yes, as far as I know. The radiotherapy ladies will try to work around my two days in Manchester by starting 2 days sooner than planned & another day 12 July, is a holiday here in N. Ireland, so the one I miss then will will be stuck on the end of my 3 weeks. All in all, I have 2 days, I think, before I go to Mallorca.  The nurse mentioned creams, so I presume I\u2019ll get those when I start. I asked for a later start time as I hope to travel via train, to avoid stressing with traffic & parking. An early train would cost me £9 return whilst a later one (after 9:30) would be £6. Mine were all lovely & I just wish the 28 June would be tomorrow! Best wishes for yourself & I hope they can work around your holiday too! M x ",

Hoping they might be a little flexible. Good luck to all xxx Melanie ",
