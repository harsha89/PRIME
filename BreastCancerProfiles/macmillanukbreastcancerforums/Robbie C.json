    "Content": "Hi you! Thanks so much for this post. I'm scrolling through the web site looking at information on post treatment. My sister has just completed her treatment and on day 3. She's good, spirits are as high as they can be for now and things can only get better. I've been hand holding from afar (I live in South America) and so have a different relationship with her to those immediately around her. I know there are times when one can express more by writing it down so from that standpoint, albeit regular texting, I'm pretty well informed. The \"moving -on\" is the unknown. For sure, it's just not possible to convey everything to everyone and possibly exhausting at times to try to do so. Your feelings as written above, I can only imagine will resonante with my sister. How will her hair look? How long will it take to grow back? And the biggie, work. Importantly work/life balance and managing others expectations plus the guilt that comes with that. She doesn't have parents to worry about and her children are now starting their professional careers so just herself and husband to cater for. I've suggested that she joins this site and connect with people in her area - I think it will good and she'll soon rearlise that their are many of you out there, all with similar concerns/experiences etc. From my side, it's been amazing the amount of thanks she has written to me. Not sure how to respond to any of it. Thank you for your thank you?  How did you manage this part? And I am also thinking about the change in interest from her immediate group of friends as she starts to look 'normal'. Perhaps this isn't a issue? Thanks so much for your time in writing your feelings - you're a star! All the best to you and your family x       ",
