      "Content": "Hi Kate, My Oncologists initial reaction was just to come off it altogether. He said he isn't happy about putting me on any alternative because they are suitable for post-menopause.  I feel this has all happened very quickly, but the side affects were so dramatic and quick, it seems I am intolerant to Tamoxifen, rather than just having side effects. Of course I could persevere to see what happens, but at the moment I can't even walk properly so there is no chance of me getting back to any sort of normal life, let alone go back to work any time soon.  What a decision ......  Kate x",

      "Content": "Hi ..... has this happened to anyone else? After just a few days of taking Tamoxifen my joints were seriously affected, making it impossible to move properly. I am only 49, previously very fit, but have found myself hobbling around, unable to get out the chair easily, unable to walk without pain, etc, etc.  I saw my Oncologist yesterday and he agreed I am intolerant to the drug. However he is not happy to put me on an alternative (pre-menopausal). I have had both chemotherapy and radiotherapy and didn't expect this dilemma at this stage. I can't cope with 5 years of pain if I continue to take it. ",
