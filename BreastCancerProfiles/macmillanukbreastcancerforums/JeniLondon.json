Many thanks Healing HUGS to all",

      "Content": "Hi, I am 2 weeks in to taking Anastrozole, so far so good feel no different! One thing though, my doctor advised me to take it in the morning and to move around for 30 mins as it is hard to digest!! She did mention that some people take it at night but that you don't want it sitting there in your tummy. So like a good girl, I take it in the morning (usually around the same time every day) and move about for 30min!!. Hope it continues like this. Good Luck stay strong.",
