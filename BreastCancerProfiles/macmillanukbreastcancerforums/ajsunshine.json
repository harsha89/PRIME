    "Content": "Hi Susan, I had my mx at the end of October and also had prob's with Seroma.mine has been drained twice and is now settling down well. I am having some issues with Lymphoma and have been referred to a special clinic.Â  Two of my children (boy 16, girl 23) have both offered to have a short cut to match mine..... I was also really upset by the thought of them doing this.... Our children do the most amazing things to help us get through all of this. My daughter has been with me through thick and thin..has held my hand and wiped my tears. I will be starting my chemo on 12th Dec so will be losing all of my hair soon (cold cap not suitable for my chemo) It is tough but you will get through this..... Father Christmas will be very busy this year with all of our wishes! Take care, big hugs ((())) Amanda xx",
