    "Content": "Ah what would I do without you all?  My first FEC was March 3rd and every time I have had a problem/query I have looked it up here and someone somewhere has had it and can help.  I have had all the usual suspects with side effects (you forget that the stuff they give you to prevent the side-effects has side-effects!).  This latest bone pain associated with filgrastim had me thinking I was having a heart attack at 2 in the morning until I realized I had read a post from a girl whose Mother had awful back pain with it and I was reassured. Will get some Clarityn for the next lot. The first week for me is the worst and then gradually better - hope that continues for the next 2 - daresay with the last 3 of T I will have all sorts of other stuff - but I know where to look for help. Thanks",
