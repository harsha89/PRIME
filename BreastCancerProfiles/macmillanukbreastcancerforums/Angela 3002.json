So I'm trying to read up on things as much as possible but without trying to scare myself with the all the horror stories. I have 4 children 9,7,5 and 2 who are being a great help. With the help of our families I'm sure we'll get through it xx",

It's true though that you just want to start the treatment. I had to wait a week for the treatment plan but then had appointments the next 2 days then it was weekend then I had 3 more appointments after that. It was all just go. Hope you feel better soon x",
