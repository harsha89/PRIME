I know I should be relieved but I am worried about the unknown all again, I have had 6 rounds of chemo, I should of been having 8 but agreed with my consultant to have justv1 more as my tumour has shrunk from 8 cm to 1 cm and I was finding it very hard to deal with I was on the verge of giving up all treatment until I saw my consultant, I am having mixed emotions this evening, has anybody else felt like this ?",
