      "Content": "Hi everyone, I would be very grateful to hear what others have to say about what is best. My mum has been told that she needs a lumpectomy followed by 3 weeks of radiation. Unfortunately the breast affected is the left one and we heard that the radiation can damage the heart. Because of this worry, she was thinking of doing a mastectomy, which is a bigger operation but it may, hopefully, not need radiation. What do you think is best?? Has anyone suffered from side-effects from the radiation? Good luck to everyone going through this or has someone they love going through it all - I hope that we all find the light at the end of the tunnel.  ",

      "Content": "Hi Dorothee,   Many, many thanks for your kind reply. Good luck with your weeks of rads and hope that it all goes well.  Did you consider a mastectomy at all? I am sorry to be so blunt.. I feel that the doctors are worried about the psychological impact, which I feel is why they offer lumpectomy if possible. I think that my mum is really worried about the radiation, which is why she is considering the mastectomy. All the best to you",

      "Content": "Thanks for your message. I am glad that it wasn't too bad for you. Did you have a CT scan first? Was each session for 10 mins? I think that we are concerned about the side-effects as my mum has sometimes high blood pressure, and all together, just worried that it may affect the heart and lungs.  Did you need to have sentinel lymph node biopsy too or just the lumpectomy? Glad that things are at the end for you and hope you and your family can soon forget about all this. Take care x",
