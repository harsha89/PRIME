    "Content": "Hi all, please forgive my ignorance as a newbie if I ask the wrong questions. However I am here on behalve of my mum. She found a lump in her breast back in 2016 and tests proved the lump to be malignant. Inspite of my best efforts mum has an inherent fear of chemotherapy, radiotherapy and the likes and as such had decided against those form of treatment or even seeing an oncologist about it since her initial tests in 2016. She has rather tried various herbal remedies and therapies. She has as at this week agreed to and have done tests which have shown that the cancer has spread to her liver.  My questions are: can this  have any indication as to what stage her cancer is? Is chemotherapy and or radio therapy still possible treatment options at this point? What can I do to ease her fears of these treatment options? (Chemotherapy etc) I appreciate that any response would only count as advise but i appreciate any information especially coming from those deally with breast cancer themselves.",
