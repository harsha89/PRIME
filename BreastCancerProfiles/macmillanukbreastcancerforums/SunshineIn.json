      "Content": "Hello Deirdre and anyone else who thinks they may have shingles,  On TC chemo regime - which clearly caused the shingles to develop. Mine started with a couple of itchy spots on my back. I rang my local 24-hour helpline and was diagnosed the same day and started on drugs. They rang back a couple of days later and confirmed the diagnosis from swabs taken. They then massively upped the dose of Aciclovir and told me to keep away from the hospital and pregnant women/babies until I was no longer infectious ie when dry scabs have formed. Fortunately, mine\u2019s not been painful \u2013 just very itchy at times. Sleeping on a towel relieves this. It is worth trying to get it sorted out as some nasty complications could develop. Hope they sort you out! Sylvia",

      "Content": "Hi Elsie 123, I've also just had a PICC put in. The (very experienced) nurse could not get it in, so had to have it done in radiology. That was fine - and just in time as had 1st chemo the same day. They also took my blood pressure on the lower arm (as my other arm is also 'out of bounds'). My problem is the general discomfort with the line - mainly down to the plastic head digging into my arm. This is driving me mad at times. I thought first that it was the potato sack covering, which was digging in too. It had been doubled and I\u2019ve had to use just one layer. I plan to experiment with some tights. It\u2019s amazing that there does not seem to be a local supplier of covers \u2013 especially adjustable ones. Livebetterwith seems quite expensive. Has anyone good experience of US suppliers? I\u2019ve been supplied with a Limbo on the NHS, though not yet tried it and quite nervous about this. All practical hints gratefully received!",

      "Content": "*** July 2017 Chemo Club *** Hello, I've just had my first chemo of TC yesterday and was really surprised how much easier it was than when I had chemo nearly 20 years ago. I' ve had steroids for the potential sickness for the three days around. So far I'm still feeling good on those though know it will wear off soon. I had the cold cap, which again was easier (so just hope it works). Had PICC fitted the same day by radiology department as my veins are small, deep and generally misbehave by collapsing if given the chance. The process was painless to my great surprise and seems to have settled down nicely overnight though it had to be positioned very high on my arm. That meant I spent all day at the hospital (from about 10.30 to nearly 6pm) and came home pretty tired. The nurses were great and gave me a goody bag of things to take at home (but only if needed!)  I know the harder part is coming next but have had some lovely messages from friends (so make sure you tell them and build yourself a support network). One down - three to go. Roll on October! I enjoy reading the messages on this community and have gained a lot of helpful hints by doing so. Mine would be: take a blanket and some leave-in conditioner to chemo unit if having cold cap. By keeping neck and shoulders warm I had no discomfort with this. Also if you have any problems with any part of your treatment, don't be afraid to speak up. These things can be fine-tuned or changed and you should not have to suffer unnecessarily. Good luck to the rest of the 'girls' going through this!",
