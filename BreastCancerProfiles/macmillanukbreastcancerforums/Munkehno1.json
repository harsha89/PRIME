      "Content": "Hi All Hope everyone is getting that Friday feeling. I\u2019m feeling really confused.... I\u2019ve been diagnosed with a grade 1 tubular cancer in my left breast measuring 2.5 cms. Further tests, mri and biopsies have shown up two separate large areas of calcs graded B3. I\u2019ve had a repeat biopsy on one area confirming B3 and on Monday get the results for the repeat biopsy on the other area of calcs. A decision will then be made as to which route I take a) lumpectomy and radiotherapy or b) mastectomy.

I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll have a definite idea which way I want to go until then. Best of luck with your recovery-it sounds as if you\u2019re doing brilliantly xxxx",
