      "Content": "I missed chemo by a whisker but the tablets are a nightmare. I take Anastrozole and haven't slept well for weeks. I manage to get to about 2am, sometimes, and then the hot sweats kick in and the aching limbs. Every hour I am up out of bed as I am dripping. We are in the South of France at the moment, in our caravan, so no where to get up and go to. It is really hot too so that doesn't help, mind you during the day it is nice! Trying to have a cat nap during the day but not easy. Hubby has gone grape picking, we are on a vineyard, I usually go too but do not feel up to it this year. You usually come back with loads of scratches from the vines so cannot afford to have that happen. I had lymph nodes removed. Love Joyce ",

      "Content": "Hi Claire, i had a lumpectomy and sentinel node removal on the 27th April. I had to stay in overnight after the op but my blood pressure was low or I might have been discharged that night. I had to wait three very long weeks for the results, grade 3 aggressive but stage 1 caught early. Two weeks after that I saw the head of radiology and she examined the scar to make sure I was healing ok. She went through all the pros and cons of radiotherapy and told me there was a big debate over me whether I needed chemo. Grade 3 is usually chemo but because my node was clear it was RADS. We had booked a holiday so was allowed to go but normally I would have had the assessment within the next two weeks. That is where they do a CT scan and the computer assesses your breast. You are also given 3 pin prick tattoos so they can line you up on the RADS machine. The most uncomfortable part of this is having to have your arm above your head in an unnatural position for 10/15mins. 2 weeks later I started RADS and that was every day for 3 weeks. I just finished two weeks ago. At the moment I am extremely red and sore under my boob and I have a very dark nipple. Sharp, shooting pains also happen and that is normal. Look for the positive and they will get a clear margin and your lymph nodes will be clear too. Hope all this helps But different hospitals may do things differently. My Breast care nurse is useless too. Never there when I needed her. Hope this helps but keep posting and lots of people will answer you. Love Joyce ",

      "Content": "Like the rest of the posts it was only recently that I was diagnosed so remember that feeling vividly. I had been given the all clear from a mammogram and ultra sound. Because we were going on holiday the breast care surgeon decided to do a biopsy but nothing to worry about. The following week I was told I had grade 2 cancer. I was in complete denial and cried and cried and cried. I had a lumpectomy on the 27th April and had to wait 3 agonising weeks for the results. When they came back it had been regraded to a 3 but hadn't spread to my lymph nodes, I had only the sentinel node removed. Again I felt devastated, scared and really worried. I missed chemo by a hairs breathe and have now completed 6 of my 15 radiotherapy sessions. This isn't a walk in the park as I have a lot of pain BUT I am still here and hope, no will, make a full recovery and get on with my life and see my grandchildren grow up. Nobody is going to make you feel any less scared but I read everything I could so I was armed with as much information as possible. My husband got to be a very good at giving cuddles and seemed to know when I needed them. Try to keep busy but all the luck in the world. Big hugs Joyce",

My oncologist said that 90 percent of women in my position were over treated e.g given chemo when RADS and hormone tablet would get just the same results. All the bump says grade 3 is automatically chemo but I didn't have it. I must admit, not that I wanted chemo, I have had black thoughts that I have left myself open to it coming back. We are in the hands of our specialists and I suppose we need to trust them. Good luck if you have to make that decision yourself, not an easy one. Love Joyce ",

The leakage from the skin, cannot remember what it was called, is the body healing itself. Whatever you do don't put any cream or lotion on as this could irritate and make it worse.

I am nearly 12 months post surgery am I am still struggling emotionally. I am about to start counselling, is there any sessions near your hospital? There is a lot of support out there, ask and get anything you can. I am so sorry your husband isn't there for you, I couldn't have coped without mine. Luckily I am retired so don't have to worry about work but I am sure your husband is wrong and you are entitled to time off for your treatment. I am sure others will clarify this.

After 2/3 months the side effects were horrendous so the specialist changed by tablets to Tamoxifen. Lucky me I developed one of the rare side effects. I had a rash and my whole body itched all the time. Drove me crazy. I tried taking Piriton, on the advice of my GP, but they had no effect. I rang my BCN and she told me to stop taking them immediately, give my body a rest for 5 weeks and then come back and see my specialist. That appointment is on the 12th January. My question is what else can I take? I am not prepared to take nothing and increase my risk of a recurrence. Has this happened to anyone else? I have tried different brands and they weren't any better. I was wondering if I asked for the original Aridex the side effects would be less. By the way I am 65 years old.",

She actually gave me her mobile number because I had an issue trying to contact my BCN or anyone when I developed an infection under my arm where they took out the lymph node. I eventually had to see my GP and my surgeon was so disgusted with the support I hadn't got she gave me her number. I did make a formal complaint and it was thoroughly looked into.

It sounds like they couldn't just remove a lump with you so that is why the MX. I must admit I would have been fighting to keep my boob as well but I want to live for as long as possible. Radiotherapy and drugs are preventative and I am really suffering with the after effects of RADS, it is like 3rd degree burns in an area the size of a saucer BUT I want to give myself as much chance as possible to prevent this horrible disease from coming back so I went with it and just accepted the surgeons suggestions. Lots of hugs for your difficult decision. Love Joyce ",

Very rare but I developed a rash that covered my body and I was making my skin bleed with the scratching. I am now on Exemestane and seem to be doing ok although I am getting a lot of headaches but hopefully these will ease. The hot flushes have been there with all of them and I am going to look into having acupuncture to help with this. I think Letrozole is stronger than Anastrozole so given to women who are stage 2/3/4/5, Tamoxifen is usually given to women pre menopause but also an alternative for post meno women, Exemestane is a different type of inhibitors and   doesn't seemed to be used as much as the others. I am glad, at least mentally, that I can tolerate this one as there was no other choice for me. It was this or leave to chance! Oh my drug is made in Italy too but from an English company. Some are made in India, China etc and it is the additives they out in that causes some of the awful side effects, all down to money! If you get one you can tolerate insist on that brand.

Overnight it has started to go brown, only in the middle at moment, the edges are still very red and inflamed. My skin is so rough and dry and comes away in handfuls. I have started putting Doublebase Gel on in to try and help it heal. I hope I don't get a reaction to that and take a step backwards. I am sick of ringing the hospital or doctor so just taken the advise of good ladies on here. Also these Anastrozole tablets. These achy joints are really kicking in put it seems to be every other day. I suppose I should be grateful it is not every day!! Real fun ride this cancer lark isn't it? We are going away for a few days to Scarborough, family party and bbq, so that should be something different. Love Joyce ",

She put on a special cool patch over my nipple to help with the burning sensation, it warms up but then you just put it back it in packet and it cools down again So you can reuse it as many times as you want. She also gave me some strips to put under my boob as that is the main area likely to get irritated. Stops the rubbing etc. these are special things for after radiotherapy. Did you get these Margy? We had lunch at the hospital as we decided to go looking for new poles for the new curtains we ordered yesterday. We are going out tonight with four friends to celebrate the end of treatment for me. The sister of one of the men is just waiting for her husband to die, cancer, so also sad for them. Hubby has just come in this patch is called Actiform cool, the strips are called Mepilex Transfer.

I shut my eyes when the machine was going over me so didn't really see where it went. I will be braver next time and keep the open! The worst bit was the positioning of me, and it was a man, so I shut my eyes again!  It is nice to have a couple of days off before I have to go every day next week. All my times are late morning, early afternoon so that is good. Keeps away from peak times. The hospital is an hour away as it is. I did get some sharp shooting pains in my breast last evening.

Hubby and I are going out for lunch afterwards to celebrate, my appointment is 11.36 and then I am seeing the nurse at 11.50 am. What a shame you have had to wait all day for the end to be there. My skin is fine, so far, slightly pinker than the other boob but only if you look closely. Nipple/scar area is pink and sometimes sore but nothing I cannot put up with. I just hope I can try and put all this to one side and get back to a normal life, whatever that may be. I have made a lemon bake well tart today for my fundraising. Enjoy your evening. Love Joyce ",

I am getting red underneath my boob so was told to not wear a bra as often as possible. I have quite big boobs so that is easier said than done as it makes me ache. I do feel a little tired today so might not be doing much this afternoon, and I am getting sharp shooting pains again. Hope you are enjoying your first free day Margy, don't feel like you have forgotten to do something? Glad that cake and wine went down well. I think we are going out for lunch tomorrow to celebrate the last session. Love Joyce ",

Hubby is downstairs to make cups of tea! The cooling pad is great, get one if you can. Do others have to pay for gel, aqueous cream etc? I have been given everything free.

It goes to prove that it is the rads that is causing all my pain so in a way that is comforting. I have decided, for better or worse, that I am going to hold a fundraising garden party. I got an email from Breast Cancer Care talking about a strawberry tea party. I have had loads of information from them and it has all been very useful so I decided to raise some money for them. I have invited over 50 people so in a way I hope they don't all come! Today I have made 50 raspberry cup cakes, they are in the freezer. My sister is making a carrot cake and a friend a gingerbread. I am going to try and make something everyday while I am feeling ok. Gluten for punishment but I would like to think women in the future will be able to access what I have been able to. Day 7 tomorrow so nearly half way through. Love Joyce ",

So considering I have eaten what I fancied over the last few months I take that as a result! I have an awful headache today that won't go away. I cannot take paracetamol so usually just use that 4 head that you rub on your forehead. Not working today. The rest of me is ok still, I am hardly pink at all, nipple just hurts.

It was a nice surprise to think I am still on someone's radar and not totally abandoned. She asked about my skin, pains etc. I seemed to me ok during the day but the shooting pains start during the evening and slowly get worse then I am ok again. If this is the worst it gets I can cope so I have my fingers crossed. I do get tired but today I have done the supermarket shopping and been baking for 3 hours this afternoon so I deserve to be a little tired. Our son and wife are coming to stay tonight and tomorrow night, her folks are also staying tomorrow night( going to a wedding near us) the strawberry tea party on Sunday(about 30people coming) and then hubbies brother is staying the following few days as he is going to help hubby with the en suite. So they will be very busy, I will keep out of the way and occupy myself! Have a lovely weekend ladies and I will let you know how much money I raise next week. Love Joyce ",

I too have only seen ladies as my oncologist/ surgeon is a lady and the head of radiology is a lady too. My son said they would see a pair every 15 minutes. I said not my pair though! I asked about cream and the nurse said no. I could use a little of the Acqueous cream if I wanted to as it is very dry around my scar area. I have got a lot of sharp, shooting pains but she said this was normal as it was the nerve endings reacting and the good cells trying to recover. I am a little itchy under my arm so I think I will stop using the Dove deodorant they said I could use in case I am reacting to that.  No redness or burning yet so fingers crossed. At least my appointments are between 11am and 1.30 pm so we can miss the peak traffic as the hospital us in Leeds about 45 minutes away. Love Joyce ",

They immediately made me an appointment to see a nurse after my treatment was over. I had to wait about 30minutes but then I was called in. She had a little chat with me but then asked me to wait as the doctor in charge of the radiotherapy team had a clinic. A few minutes later I was in her room. She examined me and said everything seemed fine, no signs of anything nasty going on. She said it was unusual to have this amount of pain but I was very bruised and swollen after my operation so my boob was saying enough. She told me to take painkillers regularly for the next week and she would see me again next Friday to make sure everything was fine. I am in still in pain but at least I know it is just pain and no underlying things going on. At least I have 2 days off now so hopefully it will give my boob a chance to relax. Love Joyce ",

I am a third of the way through now and it has gone reasonably quickly. We try to do something in the afternoon so the day isn't all about hospital and radiotherapy. Hope to hear from you soon.

The lethargy got better as the e end g went on but as soon as my head hit the pillow I was wide awake. At 3.30am I closed my book and tried to go to sleep. I must have fallen asleep as hubby woke me up at 9.30am to get breakfast and take my Anastrozole, I take it at 10am every day. My appointment wasn't until 01.12pm today so plenty of time. I do feel better today, no tiredness, headache or feeling sick. Still have joint ache but I have a dodgy shoulder and knee do that is nothing new!  After the hospital we went looking for baby things as our youngest son and his wife are expecting their first child in November. Cheered me up no end. We know it is a boy and seeing as we already have 2 beautiful granddaughters, 3 & 6, it will be lovely to gave a boy. They live in St Albans so we don't see them very often but they are coming up the weekend of the 2nd to help with the fundraising. Hope everyone else is doing good today. Love Joyce",

They had to give me Valium to calm me down!! BUT here I am and the other end. I won't lie and say it has been easy but it does get easier. I think it is being told you have cancer. I kept saying that to myself and it just didn't ring true, they were talking about someone els. When I said to someone why me, they said why not you? Made me think. Why did I think I was specialn and couldn't get a load of crap thrown at me. This is one of the worse times, waiting. The next one will be waiting for the results after your op. Then it is a mad house and you just have to go with whatever they throw at you and you will cope. My daughter in maws mum, she is a nurse, gave me a product called Rescue. You can buy it in most chemists and some supermarkets. Put 4 drops on your tongue before a stressful time and it takes the edge off and calms you a bit. All natural ingredients, give it a go. Good luck to you both and keep posting and we will keep answering and supporting. Love Joyce ",

Went for the results and out of the blue told it was cancerous. My advice, make sure you have someone with you, you cannot go in there on your own. If, and I say IF, it is bad news you will be given the best possible treatment and everything will happen quickly. Breast cancer is very treatable,not a nice journey, but you will be fine. I have just had my yearly all clear and still find it hard to believe this time last year was cr.p! Good luck.",

After the operation it was regraded to a stage 3 as the lump was bigger and there were a lot of cancerous cells in the surrounding tissue. They took out the sentinel node but this was clear so no spread. I am starting radiotherapy this Friday and was told by the oncologist that as it hadn't spread chemo would be unnecessary even though stage 3 is usually automatically chemo. She told me out of 100 women in my situation 98 percent of people given chemo would be over treated. I would really ask lots of questions. Is it a post code lottery? I am 64 years old so older but your cancer is a lesser grade and hadn't spread. Doesn't make too much sense does it? Good luck.",

I was then asked to go back through and wait. I was then directed through the scanner where you have to raise your arms for 3,seconds. The lady then started to friske me so I politely asked her to be gentle with my right breast as I had just had surgery for breast cancer.. Have you had any treatment, she aske, so I told her radiotherapy. Oh that explains it, she said, have a look at your image. all over my right boob was a bigger yellow blob. That is the radiation she said and it set our machines off! I just looked at my image with my mouth open. How long does it stay in your system? And no wonder I am still getting sharp pains. I suppose it is still killing the little buggers even after 6 weeks of finishing RADS. It is quite hot here so sitting here, in the shade, with my factor 50'on. I am really trying to pace myself as my legs are constantly throbbing and I am getting tired quite quickly. Love joyce.",

I don't know if it is a post code lottery but I was told chemo would be over treatment in my case. All the books say grade 3 is automatic chemo! Anyhow I had 15 sessions of radiotherapy and am just getting over the effects of that. Mine were bad but other ladies not so severe. I was scared shitless, pardon my French, but all not as bad as the waiting and the thoughts that go through your head. You are not going to die and you will come through this. Keep strong and sorry your hubby is also having a rough time. Love Joyce  p.s. Go on Breastcancercare.com and you can order, free, leaflets on anything you need to know about.
