      "Content": "Hi everyone I was diagnosed 7weeks ago with stage 1a invasive Ductal carcinomas. I am oestrogen positive only. I have had a partial mastectomy with reconstruction and sentinel node biopsy. Yesterday I got the results and the sentinel node was positive for cancer cells. I don\u2019t have any further details at this point. My surgeon said it makes my treatment more complicated. I have remained up beat since my diagnosis but this result has made me very anxious about disease being  in other areas of my body. I have been reading a lot and contacted my surgeon and asked for more detail on the biopsy result.  I have also been given the option of becoming part of a clinical trial.  I would appreciate any words of advise or wisdom from anyone who has had a similar journey. Thank you  Alice M",

      "Content": "Hi Thank you so much for your reply.  The trail is POSNOC it\u2019s effectively to determine weather Axillary clearance is still necessary. I believe that America has determined that clearance compared to adjuvant therapy alone are both as effective long term. I\u2019m not sure at this stage if any new drugs are used but i will let you know. I hope your recovery is speedy. Its the Unknown which makes this journey so challenging. Alice M",
