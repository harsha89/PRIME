      "Content": "Thanks for your kind replies i did get sorted eventually after hunting for somebody to do it for two days! It didnt hurt and the relief was lovely. Ive got a load in my boob and armpit growing again hopefully last untill tues outpatients if not back to A&E. Andrea Im was fortunate in it just being fluid and not infection, you poor thing i too have had dodgy aftercare and its really not something you need is it? We didnt ask for this did we? BC not the result of one too many.... so we should at least deserve some decent care. Take care xxx",

      "Content": "Hi Im 8 days post op after lumpect and lymph clearance had the drain out 4 days ago and last night got a fair bit of swelling and fluid build up under my armpit, still the same this morning and feels tender. Do i need to contact nurse or just wait and see if it rights itself? I dont think its bad enough to need draining but is it likely to get better or worse? And is there anything i can do to get rid of it? Ive spent the last 2 or 3 days moving around lots and plenty of arm exercise. Thanks kate x",
