    "Content": "Hi Mudge If it was my choice I'd go for anything which will help me live a longer life.  My sister had severe chemo and radiotherapy for her Breast cancer, but her hair grew back (better than ever as it happens) and she's still going strong, some 25 yrs later.   I'm been advised not to have chemo; it's thought that my lungs might fail in the zero white-cell count phases as I cannot afford to stop work for chemo. Sometimes living is hard, but the alternative is certainly worse.   Kate x",
