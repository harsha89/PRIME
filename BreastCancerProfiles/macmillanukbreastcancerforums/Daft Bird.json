      "Content": "Hi Sarah! It is an almost impossible decision to make, isn't it? I was in exactly the same position as you but mine was only 3mm lurking amongst the DCIS picked up on a routine mammogram and grade 3. Two lumpectomies to get clear margins and no node involvement. It's also Her2 positive but they won't give you Herceptin unless you have a course of chemo first. I've had 4 rounds of FEC and curse the side-effects daily. 4 weeks of radiotherapy then 18 x herceptin ti look forward to :-) BUT I know I will have done everything possible to kick the little bugger into touch and that if there are any dodgy cells still lurking somewhere, their days are numbered. It'll be 18 months of treatment, but I consider it worth it for even just an extra 2% peace of mind. I don't do 'what if''. Good luck with your journey on this scary rollercoaster!",

All that I can add to the excellent advice already offered is: 'Normal' as you once understood it doesn't exist anymore - the rules will change every day so rather than try to fight it, go along for the ride. Take a notebook with you when you see any of the medical team, especially the specialist nurse. Ask plenty of questions and write down the replies. You will be bombarded by so much info, you will never remember everything. Hope everything goes well xx",

I had bone marrow and blood tests and then radiotherapy as it was localised in the groin. The worst thing for me was that I was bullied into terminating an early pregnancy - timing has never been my strong point! - and then left sterile by the treatment. I am lucky to have a wonderful son though (he was 7 years old at that time) Subsequently I found that I could have kept my baby and delayed the treatment. Hey ho - life does throw some curved balls sometimes. My consultant confirmed last week that the two cancers are not related - it's purely bad luck. I must have been really bad in a previous life!",

      "Content": "Hello all! I began this journey in January when I had a recall on a routine mammogram. Lumpectomy on February 19th including 5 lymph glands followed by a re-excision on March 14th to get clear margins.  Lymph glands clear and 2 small areas of Grade 3 removed which tested positive for Herceptin. After my second 2-week check up (March 26th) I was told I would be having chemo & herceptin to 'mop up' anything they haven't found plus 20 doses of radiotherapy. An appointment would be made with the oncologist within a couple of weeks and that chemo would begin soon after. The appointment turned out to be 6 weeks after surgery because of staff shortages. The oncologist ordered all the tests and scans to make sure I was fit enough for the chemo/herceptin and at my appointment today, (May 12th) she confirmed it will all go ahead as planned. Now I have to wait until I have a chemotherapy group pre-assessment on the May 21st to find out when chemo will start. That will be at least 11 weeks from the second lumpectomy. Is this too long to wait or am I just too impatient to get things started?",

It's pouring down here :-( Once again I seem to be working my way down the list of possible side-effects of this delightful course of treatment. The story so far - Calf pains a couple of weeks ago on day 6 of 4th round of FEC rang warning bells of DVT and headed off to A&E. Scans showed no sign of a clot and all looked well. No other diagnosis was offered. The crampy/sore/achy leg slowly improved over the next couple of days and I've been wearing my 'Nora Batty' stockings :-) Had 5th dose of FEC on Tuesday and today I can barely walk. Pain is now from the back of my thigh, down through the calf and into my foot. Assuming it's still not DVT, what does anyone think? Cramp? Cellulitis? Phlebitis? (The veins in my arm are now totally flea'd up) Exercise or rest? Painkillers or not? Anyone else had anything similar?",

Last week we were in Primark looking at flowery hairbands and I was bemoaning the fact that I won't be wearing flowers in my hair this summer. He said 'You could have stick-on ones'. The bruises on his arm should fade eventually :-)",

      "Content": "Did you get those quotes from my mother????? :-) I don't have metastatic breast cancer and I can't begin to imagine how difficult it is to live with but I find that people I talk to are probably as scared as I am about the whole thing. This leads them to say a) the first thing that pops into their head or b) something they think will comfort me or c) something they think might actually be useful. The way I look at it - it's not their fault I have cancer and at least they haven't crossed the road to avoid speaking to me. I just smile, nod and talk about something else :-)",

      "Content": "I can understand the thought processes involved here but I've never kept my mobile phone anywhere near my body so it can't be the cause of my breast cancer. However 25 years ago I had one of the first in-car phones which was fitted near the handbrake.Around the same time I was diagnosed with non-hodgkins lymphoma in the groin. 2+2=4 or 5 or 7? I dunno!

      "Content": "I've had frozen shoulder x2 and I can confirm it is the most painful and debilitating condition. As previously said, acupuncture can help. I was lucky to find my local NHS physios were trained in acupuncture so it's worth asking your GP. Cold packs wrapped in a tea towel also provide relief. The exercises that I was given when I had my lumpectomy are very similar to those given for frozen shoulder too. A tennis ball in a long sock rolled between your back and a wall feels good if not excruciatingly painful. Bizarre! The 'normal' scenario is that it takes 18 months to resolve - 6 months freezing, 6 months frozen and 6 months defrosting. Arm movement becomes increasingly restricted especially above the head and behind the back. Hope that helps xx",

      "Content": "Oh...those steroids certainly mess with your sleep patterns! I had my 3rd chemo on Tuesday and this morning I was wide awake @ 3am despite having the steroids @ 4pm yesterday. I lay awake until 5am and fetched a cup of tea up for my dearly beloved only to be told that he didn't need to get up until 6.45 and not 5.45. Ooops, bless him he drank it anyway and went back to sleep :-) I got up, made myself breakfast and went back to sleep on the sofa cuddling the dog until 9.15. I'm on Emend and Ondansetron too so I'm thinking of cutting down on the steroids today as I have had no nausea at all since starting chemo.  Good luck with sleeping tonight everyone xx",

There are lots of great Youtube videos of tying scarves made by women with hair loss due to chemo and alopecia. I like these: https://www.youtube.com/user/EyelineHerBlog Also check out the Jewish ladies who cover their hair when they marry. I've made a couple of tichels - try doing a Google image search on them. Agree that a wig is just too hot, scratchy and fake-looking.",

Enquiries with the medics have just produced wry smiles but nothing to say it'll do any harm. The smell of the Hirudoid cream they've given me just makes me heave.",
