    "Content": "Just happened to click on this thread and read with interest. I went through chemotherapy and radiotherapy for lower bowel cancer. I was fortunate that hair loss was a rare side effect of the chemo I received and all I suffered was a slight thinning. The pelvic radiotherapy however has left me completely bald down below with no hope of it returning. I keep telling myself it's a small price to pay for survival, but I am devastated by it, along with the infertility. There is a massive difference between doing something by choice and having no choice. Perhaps Macmillan could do a \"Brave the pubic hair Shave\" campaign, but I suspect there wouldn't be much interest as nobody would be able to see what was going on underneath their clothes thus no pats on the back for being so \"brave.\"",
