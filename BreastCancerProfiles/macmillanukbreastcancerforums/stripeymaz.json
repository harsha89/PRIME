      "Content": "Thank you for your support and providing an ear! I'm seeing my BCN on Tuesday so I'll definitely run it past her and I think it might well be worthwhile dropping PALS an email to register how unsatisfactory the appt was. Apart from everything else it was a complete waste of money. I also 'annoyed her' by asking whether my MUGA scan and DEXA scan had been arranged. Also I was promised a follow up CT scan to check the flickering  intermammary nodes which seem to have been forgotten about. Of course none of these had been arranged as she didn't know me from Adam.  I really feel for more vulnerable people who don't have people to share the burden or who can't or won't stand up and fight their corner.  Luckily I'm all over what is happening and will stand up and say when something isn't right (as much as one can ). Maybe I'm lucky that 8 months down the line it's the first time I've had cause to rant.",

I also need to remember that having demanded  a proper appointment with my consultant to sort it out , I have been given one at the very next clinic. I thought I'd be waiting weeks. Right at the start of this whole saga back last June another consultant told me that this particular oncologist had looked at his list of new patients and said he'd take me as he knew he could make a difference and his skill set could sort me out. At the end of the day that's good enough for me without dragging over and over any 'bad days' that he happened. I'm therefore putting the overheard issue out of my mind and concentrating on correcting the registrars awful handling of the appointment which I've pretty much done now.",

      "Content": "Does anyone mind if I rant about today's appt and let off a bit of steam please? I should start by saying that up until today I cannot fault any part of the treatment I have had but today takes the biscuit. I had a follow up oncology appt after my mx on 6th Dec. I've already seen the surgeon so was fairly up to speed thankfully. Today I saw a registrar which would have been fine had she had the slightest idea who I was or what was happening. The clinic was running nearly one and a half hours late. The registrar started off quite breezy by sweepingly saying everything had gone well. She didn't know what op I'd had and didn't have my notes.  She suggested I might need to start Tamoxifen even though I'm already 10 days into Letrozole prescribed by the surgeon. Then she asked about menopause status. At that point my husband had a meltdown because they ask us this at every single appt and haven't yet done the blood test.  I said that they must know what the status is or I wouldn't have been given Letrozole. My husband said that we'd been waiting for over an hour and now she had no information and was being vague. Red rag to a bull and she blamed us, the NHS and every other dept in the hospital.  More was said but too much to go into here. Whilst I accept that clinics over run I do not accept that medical practitioners should see cancer patients without their notes and then wonder if they should change drug regime on the basis that I looked young. She went back next door to see the main oncologist and we heard him tell her to hurry up and get us done and dusted so they could get on.  Am I being a diva or does this sound wrong? Thanks for listening.",

She also told me there were moves afoot to revamp the oncology wing with thicker walls and more privacy. We'll see. That'll probably just means we won't be able to overhear them hurrying us out!!

The last thing I wanted to do was have to complain about those that I have staked so much with especially as I recently had such good results after surgery but these concerns need to be heard. It's too important to let it slide. Lin, after reading your post it makes much more sense. She definitely had the demeanour of a fish out of water. Frankly it would have been better if they'd cancelled the appointment.  So I've emailed the consultant's secretary.  I said that the clinic running late is not an issue but my treatment by his registrar was.   I have listed all the issues that she fell short on including her defensive behaviour. I have listed every part of the conversation that we weren't happy with and stated why.  He would have heard the raised voices for sure. I have stated that I want another appointment with him at his convenience but asap . I've told him I want a treatment plan and that I also want a written copy of the report from the appointment  ( that'll be interesting ). I've also pointed out how good the care has been up til now.  I haven't at this stage mentioned what we overheard. I don't want to put that in writing in case we heard wrong ( although I know we didn't  ).  My treatment is up to date and the surgeon's follow up appointment was excellent so there's no medical harm done other than to upset and annoy me. I think my email should be enough just to tell the consultant who I liked and respected up until yesterday that I am far from happy. Also I imagine it will inconvenience him to have to find another appointment for me. Good. This will give him the opportunity to put things right and will hopefully be all that is needed.

I was sent off from my last oncology appt as no evidence of disease and then came back from 2 weeks away to find I'd got a surprise ultrasound and a surprise CT arranged to look at 'an area of interest '. Obviously I freaked out but the results from both show that it's likely trauma from the surgery.  It has caused a take up of FDG on the scan which I think I'm right in saying can be caused by tumours or things like trauma. As they can't find any evidence of anything sinister it's thought that it's the trauma. None of this stops the worrying though does it but hopefully hearing my experience might reassure you a bit. I don't think the oncologist would say she wasn't worried if she was. Maz x",

I was 100% definite that I didn't want reconstruction and never will. I didn't want endless surgeries, appointments and tweaks. I was also concerned (rightly or wrongly ) about being able to monitor for recurrence if I was 'blocking the view' so to speak with an implant or similar. I am also a tiny build and I think that makes the decision a bit easier to be honest.  I've got a knitted knocker which I've found really comfy and two or three softies that the hospital gave me. I find them a bit light and you need a pocket to keep them from riding up. I've also just got my new silicone prosthesis. Again in a pocket I find it fine and it gives a nice shape, you'd never know. I think I could easily wear a vest top without anyone noticing.  Quite often at home I don't bother with anything and that suits me fine as well.

      "Content": "Hello everyone I am very late to the party as I was diagnosed on 5th July but I have been lurking, reading and learning and I hope you don't mind me hopping on board. I have a couple of questions but wanted to say hello and share my experience so far in the hope it might help someone else just beginning. So I'm 53 and a self employed gardener. I discovered a lump and after a speedy referral from my GP found myself with a diagnosis of Grade 3, Stage 3, IDC with some as yet, not fully determined lymph node involvement and two involved intermammary nodes. I'm triple positive. A CT PET scan and brain MRI are seemingly clear so on 28th July I started on neo adjuvant chemo.  3 accelerated EC, two weeks apart and 4 Doxetaxel, Herceptin and Perjeta ,3 weeks apart. I've done 6, one to go. The game plan then will be surgery of some sort, radiotherapy, herceptin injections and zolendronic acid infusions plus letrozole. The first thing that has struck me is that up until now I have found chemo very manageable. I was horrified when I first found out this would be needed and thought I'd have the first one and take to my bed for 6 months. I know everyone is different and every regime is different but I hope it might help some people to hear that it MIGHT not be as bad as you think. I've had ropey days of course- horrible fatigue, dry skin, my taste buds are shot, a poorly mouth with oral thrush on the first doxetaxel but all in all I have managed to function. I have managed a minimal social life(away from germs), I go and visit my Mum, do the weekly shop, do the odd bit of work or potter in our garden. My hair is gone other than a white fluff and my eyelashes are thinning. I look like I've got mange but it's not my priority. I think I've rambled enough but hopefully I've eased the worry for some of those that are just diagnosed. I know for some it is very difficult but just wanted to say that it might not be!!

I do think that getting a balance of experiences is important though. I haven't escaped unscathed by any means and I hope I don't have to do it again ever but it's good to get other people's input. I am by nature a positive and upbeat person and I think that has helped as well. I've had to be realistic about work though. As a self employed gardener I had engineered myself a very physical workload and my onc team were insistent they didn't want me to work due to the fatigue and the infection risk if I cut myself(which I do just about every day!). If I'm honest I'm a bit in limbo because despite me saying I'm sailing along, in truth I'm not fit enough to be working to the extent I was but I'm definitely not ill enough to be sitting around at home every day. So I stay in touch with my customers and like yours, toxophilite they have been wonderful. No one has replaced me permanently, some are muddling through, some have temporary help and two have bought their own lawnmowers until I'm fit! I say in the loop and like you say, it keeps you sane. Losing the income is tricker though. So think I've decided to focus 100% on my treatment. I've got a long way to go and I need to get the most out of it, getting through whether it's a week, a day or an hour at at time.  Part of my  'roll my sleeves up and get on with it' attitude was to start chemo no 1 on 28th July and shave my hair off on July 29th.

I had acelerated EC then doxetaxel with herceptin and perjeta.  I finished chemo on 10th November and had my mastectomy on 6th December, so less than a month.  I also lost 10 lymph nodes.  I seem to have bounced back fairly quickly. I had blood tests before the surgery so I knew I was OK to go ahead. I've had no problems with healing other than a bit of superficial infection that I've had antibiotics for. I was pretty fit before my diagnosis and I think this has helped me get over chemo without any real horrors and straight after surgery I was out walking every other day and now I'm back cycling.

I had chemo before surgery and ended up with a mastectomy rather than the lumpectomy we'd intially hoped for.  3 out of 10 nodes affected but all removed along with a surprise bit of DCIS. Just waiting for a CT to check on 2 inflamed intermammary nodes. Like you I've remained positive throughout, ridiculously so actually. However, I've definitely had low points when the doubts and 'what ifs' crept in. I don't know how to tell you to fight it,we are all different. Occasionally I'd shed a few tears but mostly I'd find something to take my mind off it and keep my brain busy. A bike ride, a walk, pottering in the garden depending on how well you feel. I lost myself in a book or rubbish film otherwise.  I definitely had a wobble before my last chemo. Don't know why - change of routine, fear of the unknown probably.   What I know now is that I won't let this disease ruin my life if I've got anything to do with it. It's ruined a year, enough is enough.  I'm not ready to leave my family and neither should you be Love and positive thoughts",

I've finished neo adjuvant chemo and the lump has responded very well but, in the view of my team and me, not quite enough of a response to make it a done deal to get clean margins. I can't be doing with lots of surgeries so I'm happy with this decision and no reconstruction. I will also have minimal if any rads with this route as the Big Cheese has decided that the intermammary nodes that were shining were only flickering and it is not enough to warrant treatment at this stage. In the new year, a decision can be made. I asked about surgery before Christmas and 6th December has been offered.  Wow, my feet haven't touched the ground since, pre op is arranged and it's actually happening!  My BCNs, although lovely are overwhelmed and unless I specifically ask, they seem conspicuous by their absence. In fact, I've only met mine once. At the last appointment no one was present and at the one before she couldn't show me any prostheses as they were locked in a cupboard and seemingly couldn't be got out! Anyway I've made an actual appointment to go in and get my two pages of questions answered and in the meantime, hubby and me are off to the gorgeous Yorkshire Dales for a long weekend to recharge our batteries and try and 'be normal' while there's a lull in activity.

      "Content": "Thank you for your replies. It's really good to know that you agree with my decision and especially to hear that those of us that opt for no reconstruction are not weird, unfeminine or not bothered about how we look. In some ways, it's easy for me to make the decision I have being a small build I think. A lot of people have told me I can 'just' have reconstruction later on without realising the implications. I know that I will never want it, that's just me but it's interesting how the automatic perception is that we'd all want it. I've always tried to be really positive right from the outset and it's carried me this far. I'm sure it helps. I also have a black sense of humour, a family trait. I'll investigate knitted knockers, they sound fab and might be just the job if my hospital insist on keeping their prostheses locked in a cupboard!  Sorry mrsox, it's just a single mastectomy for me at this stage. For me, I'm happy with that but I think it's unfair for you to have to fight to have what is such an important choice. I hope someone listens to you very soon. Love Maz x",

      "Content": "I've just finished 7 cycles of neo adjuvant chemo and have been incredibly lucky to have had few problems. I'm running a month ahead of my schedule so met the surgeon last week. She was lovely and I have full confidence although it's not as cut and dried as we all hoped.  I have grade 3, stage 3, IDC, 30mm lump with a bit of lymph activity and two possibly involved inter mammary nodes. Initially,  a lumpectomy was on the cards but now I have to decide. Half way through treatment the lump had halved. Latest scan last week showed it had flattened and changed but not necessarily shrunk any more. I'm slightly disappointed as we'd hoped for a full response but hey ho. I was given all the details and the thought process so far but my gut reaction is that the surgeon thinks that a mastectomy might  be a better option. She said they could 'try' to get the lump and margins out but it would mean taking over 40% away  and I'm a tiny build. If that didn't achieve the clear margins first time I'd have to go back for a mastectomy anyway . I'd have extensive radiotherapy all over with a lumpectomy and it's my left side so heart and lungs could be a factor. My mind is 99% made up I think. I'm seriously thinking of going straight to a mastectomy. I don't think I'd look any different flat than if they took 40%. I never want reconstruction of any sort, my mind is made up on that. I'm very much a 'hit the ground running' sort of person and I wonder if this is the best option. Get in, get done, get on ! Having said that I am a worrier as well and I don't think I'd ever stop wondering whether the lumpectomy had been enough. There is a MDT meeting to discuss the options and we go back on Wed next week for further discussions as I've asked if I could get it done before Christmas. Thanks for listening Maz x",

I tried ringing as instructed but kept getting through to an answerphone that was unable to take messages according to the recording!! I eventually got through to a human being and explained and gave details of the dates we are away. The human being took the details and my holiday dates and then sent me another appointment for a bit later during my holiday!  I have managed to rearrange it again and now have 3 separate letters all which have a cost impact I'm sure. Today I went for a DEXA scan. The letter stressed the importance of attending and explained about the cost of the procedure and the cost of not attending . When I was called in I was told I couldn't have it today because I had a PET scan last Friday and the radioactivity would not have left me yet. Does no one join up the dots? I know these are tiny niggles in the scheme of things but keep adding them all up and it's not hard to see where the money goes.",

      "Content": "The more I think about this and the more I read,  the more I think I'll go for a mastectomy and get  it done and dusted. I know the recurrence possibilty is meant to be the same but in my mind I think I'd rather go for a belt and braces approach. It may be overkill but I don't want to keep going back for more surgeries, I want my life back. JoDec I agree, if you are going to end up with something that frankly looks a mess or is incomplete then I may as well get the whole thing gone. I am very small in that department so personally,  for me I don't think it will make much difference.  The intermammary thing is very unclear. I had a PET/CT scan at the time of diagnosis which was clear other than two shiney,  inflamed nodes in my chest. They are not operable and chemo is meant to deal with them. I'm waiting to see if another scan is ordered to check now that chemo is done. The difficulty is apparently that they may be inflamed for a number of reasons. They could be cancerous, they may just be annoyed by the treatment, the chemo or the biopsies. Hopefully the meeting on Wed will shed a bit more info so I'll post again if so. Radiotherapy is also a possibilty for them. I'm losing a bit of AX node from the lump side but not sure how much. I have a metal clip in the first one which is now bigger than the node so that worked well. It will still go though. Thank you for your replies and good luck. I know everyone has to make their own decisions but gut instincts are helpful I think. Maz x",

      "Content": "Hi Tansi Sorry for weighing in late but I didn't want to confuse the conversation as I'm not sure I've got the same thing but I thought I'd tell you anyway! At the time of diagnosis I was told I had two intermammary nodes that were shining on the CT PET scan. The world 'involved' was used. They are in my chest area but are not operable so didn't get taken with last weeks mastectomy.  Obviously I've been really worried about them but the hope is that my neo adjuvant chemo has dealt with them. Then the big cheese at radiology was consulted and shown the original scans and he said that they were not shining brightly enough to be of concern, they were only flickering. They told me that they could flicker for a number of reasons . Apart from being diseased they could be inflamed and shining because they are annoyed by treatment, the tumour or the fact that my immune system is working hard. So it could be they are not cancerous, just involved. Like Dreamthief, I'm wondering whether they could really inflame enough to cause breathing issues for your Mum. I haven't had my surgery pathology results yet but I'm having another CT PET scan in 3 months or so when the amount of flickering/shining will be reassessed and I'll get rads if necessary  . Not sure if any of this waffling is of any help but good luck Maz x",

Thank you Leolady.  I've been on such a high since I got my no evidence of disease but it seems it comes with a caveat.  I was called in for a surprise ultrasound to look at 'an area of interest'. For crying out loud, does it never end? It seems I had some shiney areas on a CT scan . The oncologist mentioned it but said it wasn't anything I should worry about. Easier said than done.  Anyway after lots of ultrasounding they think it's trauma from the mastectomy.  There's no lump, nothing to biopsy and the shiney bits are sparse and spread over a largish area. She told me there was nothing that she could see that concerned her. So why does this concern me more than most things that have gone before I wonder? Onward and upward Maz x",
