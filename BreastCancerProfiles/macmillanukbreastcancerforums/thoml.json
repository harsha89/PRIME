      "Content": "Hello, i am 35 and was diagnosed at the start of the year with stage 3 IDC( ER+PR+Her2-), cancer was in 9 of lymph nodes.Â There was over 100mm of multi focal IDC in breast and i had the lump at least 2 years at point of diagnosis. I have finished active treatment, my radiotherapy ended a few months ago and i am taking tamoxifen. I have recently started having some pain in hip, lower back and my side under ribs ( for about a month) i am seeing oncologist anyway later this week but have been concerned about spread. I was under the impression that chemo would kill off all cancer cells but have read recently of people who have been found to have secondary cancer not long after their active treatment ends and they are taking tamoxifen. I suppose i am just wondering if that is very rare? How could that happen?",
