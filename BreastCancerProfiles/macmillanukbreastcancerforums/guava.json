    "Content": "Due to have Chemo on 9th June for 8 rounds following successful lumpectomy and 18 node clearance. I have two kids, but my 7 year old is super sensitive. So far I breezed through diagnosis and surgery without the kids knowing anything - to all effects and purposes I am as usual to them and hosted my 7 year olds party of 12 kids and 14 adults 9 days after surgery. To be fair, they stayed with their grandparents the few days after surgery, but that wouldn't be unusual for them to do at any time. My biggest concern in my 7 year old - the 3 year old would just laugh at me and ask for chocolate when she sees me doing a GI Jane, so I have no concerns with her, just my 7 year old who is mega sensitive and easily frightened, especially at the moment following a discussion at school, totally unrelated, that has left her mega aware of illness and therefore death, with which she seems pre-occupied at the moment - is nanny dying, is grandad?. I really don't want her to be scared because as far as I am concerned, apart from going through this for insurance, I am well, so I don't want her to feel I am not. Sure I may feel lousy for 6 or more months, but I will be well. Has anyone with kids managed to hide hair loss from them completely - would I be more nuts than I already am to even consider it - I would note this kids will be away a lot through the summer with their grandparents. If it weren't for what my daughter is going through it wouldn't occur to me to even consider this. Your thoughts appreciated.",
