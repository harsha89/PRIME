    "Content": "Very bad of the hospital to recommend that particular specialist company when there are several online companies who specialise in post-mastectomy wear and show prices without VAT.  Some also supply swimwear, nightwear and summer tops with built-in bras and the service is usually very good.   I have used NicolaJane for years, also Eloise and Amoena.  NicolaJane even have a shop in London and Amoena have one near Southampton, so you can be professionally measured and try on items before you buy.  As I don't live near them I usually order online and order several different sizes to check the fit. NicolaJane offer free returns in the UK so it doesn't cost me extra. In my view every hospital which carries out breast surgery should have copies of these companies' catalogues to give to patients to show them you can still look good in everything you wear. Susan.",
