    "Content": "Hi I had lymph node clearance in 2009, aged 42 and did u fortunately get lymphodema, I was very sporty so whether I did too much I don,t know.I have just under gone further surgery for advanced breast cancer and am in letrozole for 5 years. The lymphodema is no worse in my arm after surgery but is further round behind my armpit, I have been referred back to the lymphodema nurse but still waiting for an appointment - not sure what would help that area? I think each case is very different as our bodies react in different ways, some people have very little problem following surgery",
