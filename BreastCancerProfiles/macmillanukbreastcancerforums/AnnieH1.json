    "Content": "I had first infusion of Zolendronic Acid along with FEC chemo 3. It is a 15 minute infusion. Unfortunately it (or GCSF) caused a massive temperature spike and I ended up in hospital. If you are not on chemo that shouldn't be an issue. The side effects are flu like symptoms. There can also be (rare) issues with osteo-necrosis so you are advised to get teeth checked beforehand. I think the recommended doses are 6 monthly infusions for 3 years.Â ",
