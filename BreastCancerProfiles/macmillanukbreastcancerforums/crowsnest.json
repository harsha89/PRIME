    "Content": "Has anyone stopped taking their treatment before the five years are up and with what results. After surgery, chemo, radiotherapy and herceptin taking nearly two years (all in France) I have now been taking Arimidex for four years and because of this having to take treatment for bone loss. In the last two months I have been losing my hair, quite quickly, and it's not growing at all.   Is this an effect of the medication and what could happen if I stop taking it?   Has anyone had similar problems?   On the subject of Portecath - I had mine inserted whilst I was having surgery and I believe that this is common practice in France - I certainly didn't see anyone having their treatment in any other way.  It wasn't even noticeable and I just have a small scar after removal.    Why can't we have this in England?",
