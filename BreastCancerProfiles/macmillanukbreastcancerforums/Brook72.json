My treatment is at 2pm so I was going to shower in the morning as usual. There seems to be lots of different advise about the cream - I was told to use E45 only - I mentioned R1 and Aloe Vera and I was told not to waste money on it! The radiotherapist said that if your skin is prone to burning it will happen whether you use an expensive one or not. I got the impression that you gently shower the cream off before the treatment the next day. I must admit I felt I was making a bit of a fuss with all my questions about the cream! Xxx",

I will be honest and tell you that it was more painful than the mastectomy for me because it affected both my shoulder and arm. My advice would be to keep taking the painkillers regularly and try to keep doing the exercises. I didn\u2019t have a drain after and got a small swelling under the scar but that went down after about a week. I have had a couple of small grazes/cuts on my finger since, I use antiseptic wipes and then cover with a plaster to avoid any infection risk. You will feel a relief when those infected nodes are removed. I hope the rest of your treatment goes well xxxx",

I'm feeling sorry for myself (unusual for me) because despite taking painkillers I have terrible pain in my shoulder where the nerves had to be cut and my upper arm is numb.  I am, like you, worried about lymphedema.
