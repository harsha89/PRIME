      "Content": "Hi Coastal-lady I'm sorry to hear about what you're going through during treatment. One of our Experts (Harpreet, a pharmacist) has answered a previous question about turmeric, and says there is no solid evidence that turmeric can prevent or aid cancer treatment. She also linked to some further information from Cancer Research UK but it sounds like you may have already read that. Our team of experts on the Macmillan Support Line can provide support and information to you as well and may be able to help with your specific difficulties around aches and pains. They are available to talk from Monday to Fridays from 9am - 8pm on 0808 808 0000 (calls are free in the UK). You can also ask our nurses on the community if you would prefer to speak to someone online. Best wishes, Rachel Macmillan Community Team",
