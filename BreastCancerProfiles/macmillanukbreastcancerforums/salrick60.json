    "Content": "Hi George and Jackie Just want to say thank you for spotting my post on the new to site thread and directing me to this group. I am already much reassured by some of the things I have read. Also a huge thank you for the info about lymph nodes. Despite speaking to 2 BCN's about my worries that the cancer was in my lymph nodes they both neglected to inform me that the function of lymph nodes was to trap stray cancer cells so I assumed that if the cancer had spread to them then it had probably spread elsewhere as well. Of course I realise that I won't have a definitive answer until after my mx and lymph node removal but am currently feeling the most positive that I have since diagnosis. It also helps that I saw the GP this morning (never seen her before) and she was super, really calm and reassuring.She prescribed propranolol and although have only taken one tablet so far I have not felt the crippling effects of panic which have plagued me since finding out the cancer had spread to my lymph nodes. Anyway thanks again for your support and I will definitely be visiting the group on a regular basis from hereon out. Regards Sally",
