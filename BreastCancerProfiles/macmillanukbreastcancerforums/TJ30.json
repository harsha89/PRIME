      "Content": "Wow I'm amazed that different hospitals operate so differently! I have had several ultrasounds since starting neo-aduvent chemo - one after first cycle, then after 4th (both EC) then another one as I missed 6 weeks chemo due to low bloods, illness ect then Iv had another after 2 rounds of Carbo/Paxil and then due one more the day after my lady chemo in Feb! I also had a marker put next to my lump on my diagnosis but have never had an MRI?Â ",

Haven't had to pay for either of them so strange she is being asked too! Have you queried this with your hospital PAL or compliants Team? X",
