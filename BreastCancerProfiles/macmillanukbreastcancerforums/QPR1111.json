      "Content": "Hi, Anne-Marie , thankyou for ur post...i had my 1st FEC just over a week ago and the 1st 5days were hell, my family do what they can but i find it so frustrating that i cannot do it all anymore, im feeling better at the moment but the tiredness just overpowers me most days..so i rest when i can, but yes with 4yr old and a baby its draining.  Still have my hair (had it cut really short before chemo started), my son keeps saying uve still got ur hair mummy, bless him...just gonna be a shame tht in a couple of weeks he starts school and ive my 2nd FEC the same day, but i will be able to take him and pick him up as its later that day, but guess i will have lost my hair by then.  Think will ask for a different drug for sickness as was sick from 8pm till 1am that 1st day, then felt rubbish for a few days after, dread the sickness like that again. Thankyou and take care Sharon x",

      "Content": "Hi its lovely to hear ur stories...ive ha a lumpectomy and due to start chemo within the next 2 weeks...ive 4 children aged 17,16, 4 and 8months...im finding the hardest part is explaining to my 4yr old about losing my hair when i start the chemo..he is a hair twiddler...we have read the mummys lump book and that made it easier to tell him about things that may happen..i know it will be hard work as ive the lil ones but hoping my older children and hubby will do all they can...scary stuff now !! Wish all u ladies well take care , sharon xx",
