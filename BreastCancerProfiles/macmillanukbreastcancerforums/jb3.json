    "Content": "Hi to everyone, I'm new on here, and although its my mum who has breast cancer, I have found the site and your posts really helpful. I had no idea what to expect, or what was going to happen, but  having read through what you all say its given me some insight as to what is going to happen. I;ve been reading up andthen going to see her and saying well this lady said this and the other lady said that. she's had a lumpectomy and lymph nodes removed, has to have 3 FEC then 3 taxotere (apologies for the spelling side of things!!) She had the fist fec a few weeks ago and had bloods taken yesterday but they phoned up this morning to say that they were too low to come in today for 2nd lot of FEC.!!! does anyone have any ideas how to boost the white cells back up by eating certain things?? or is there anything that she can do?? Any ideas on how i can help are appreciated too, Ive been to all of the appointments with her including the head piece and wig fittings class. but i was trying to think of somethin to take her mind off this bloody cancer and chemo. (i know thats not going to happen, but even if just for 10 minutes i can find something to just chill/relax her) its my turn to give something back now and be there 100% for her. Jodie x  ",
