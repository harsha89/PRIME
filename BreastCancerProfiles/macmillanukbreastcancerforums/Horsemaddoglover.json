      "Content": "I too am in the process of losing my hair for the second time and it doesn't get any easier in my case.  I so wish I could embrace the bald head but hate looking at my wrinkled unrecognizable self in the mirror.  I want to shave it now as it so thin but need my hairdresser to trim wig and she on holiday.  As yet my eyelashes and brows still in tact and I so hope they stay.  I have a wig, cap with hair hanging and the obligatory caps for sleeping.  As you say the plus side is no more shaving legs etc for a while.    I so admire the brave people who dare to bare.  Wish I was brave.

So far so good.  Tried not to sleep today as was totally wired last week at this time.  I've taken a nytol and have sleepy balsam under nose so I hope I sleep. Skipped my glass of wine but maybe I should have had it as can increase sedative affect of nytol..  I know tomorrow I will be either flat or flying and will get redness on my left side of face an body.  Hope this means it working.  I have now acquired a selection of wigs some given and all different.  My husband can have a new wife every day if i can pluck up courage to be different.  Feel safe with what I know.xx",

No sedation just local anaesthetic.  It's a godsend as so much easier to get bloods and administer chemo.  I use emls cream on it and it makes everything totally painless as i hate needles.  Let me know how you get on.  The worst part for me was waiting to go to theatre as there was a 2 hour delay. ",

I really don't know who to turn to for help.  I am on waiting list for counselling.  Please give me some words of encouragement.   I am so negative I just can't seem to find any positive vibes.",
