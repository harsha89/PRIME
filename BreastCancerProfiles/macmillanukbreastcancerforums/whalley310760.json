      "Content": "Hi there, I was diagnosed with breast canser 13th feb after having my first mammogram in january being 50 years old.  Ive had 2 ops for lumpectomys and have now been told i have to have a mastectomy now.  They have offered me breast reconstruction at the same time which i am going to do but to choose which way is proving difficult,  Ive narrowed it down to having it by using tissue from my abdomen but have now to decide on which procedure for this, there are 3 ways to do this, and i have to decide !!!! how can i make this decision, im not a doctor, waiting to see breast care nurse to go through the options and hopefully she will tell me in words i can understand not like the consultant who was very clinical to say the least, Any advice would be much appreciated, as im so scared !!!!!! Take care all Donna x",

      "Content": "Hi Helen, Thanks so much for you reply, it is good to hear from other girls going through the same as me, I have felt quite alone in all of this eventhough I have lots of friends and my little family supporting me but they have no idea how im feally feeling, so fed up of trying to be brave in front of my kids, one still living at home, she is 19. I have thought about \"what if\" i get cancer in the other breast and have already had the tummy option and what would happen then, i think I shouldnt think abut that otherwise im going to go mad, already feel like im \"losing the plot\" and am going to see my GP monday. Im also going to speak to my breast care nurse and tell her how im feeling and that im struggling to decide on the way foraward. Talke care Donna xx",
