    "Content": "Hi All, this is the first time I have posted in this forum so hoping to benefit from all your experience ladies. I had an LD Flap reconstruction with Tissue Expander on 7 December 2017. The tissue expander has not yet been expanded because my skin is not stretching as fast as it should. Apparently this is common after radiation. Has anyone else experienced this and do you  have any tips on what I can use to help the skin along. Does Bio-Oil work? Im also slightly worried that maybe the skin will never stretch to allow expansion of the Expander. Is this possible I wonder? Secondly, yesterday I  developed a blister on the worst part of the skin. Its right in my cleavage on the side of the reconstructed breast. The skin here is normally always slightly red and this is the bit where the consultant said the skin is not happy, but now I have a blister about the size of a ten pence piece. I have left a message for the BC nurse to call me back but again just wondering if anyone else experienced this. Any advice will be greatly appreciated :-) Leigh",
