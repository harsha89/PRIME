      "Content": "hi everyone, i have just joined this site tonight as i think the more support the better for me just now and talking to people in the same boat. I found my lump on 24th september. I was so desperate to find out that i went private first just to 'put my mind at rest' mainly because of my children,my middle son being disabled and i am his main carer. a fine needle aspiration was done but was seeming to indicate a papiloma type tumour and no cancer cells were yet detected but my case would be passed on to the nhs for further investigation. After further tests I am now diagnosed with invasive breast cancer. have had one round of chemo, found it extremely hard the 3 days after it but am brighter now. looking to talk to people in the same boat and this is why i joined. scared of it all really ..... caroline",

      "Content": "Hi there j thanks for the lovely message. I have had one round of chemo which made me so exhausted for the three days afterwards. I am also mum to a seven year old son and a 19year old son and soon to be granny (a young one) lol. I read your profile and it sounds like you have similar to myself although mine isnt hormone related. it has become fast growing, already reached lymph nodes. i have to be re scanned half way through to see if it is working. It is scary how your life can be turned upside down. It has took me a few weeks to get over the shock but i am here now and have to deal with it. You sound like such a strong and positive lady and you will beat this too!! I hope you are feeling ok just now regards caroline",
