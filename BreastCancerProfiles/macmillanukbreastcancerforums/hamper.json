    "Content": "Been on Anastrozole for just over a year and find a lot of the time I can't get to sleep til 2 or later and still wake up every couple of hours, resulting in feeling tired the next day. However, I have got used to it and have learned to live with it. Joint pain much better now and hardly bothers me. However, I have days when I feel weak and I don't know if I'm imagining this but it seems worse when I take the brand Teva, doesn't seem too bad when I have the Accord brand. Any comments on this welcome.",
