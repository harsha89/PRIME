      "Content": "I am on my third FEC. 1st: felt bad for two days then felt really positive. 2nd: felt bad for four days then ok. 3rd: had a bit of a cold when I had my chemo and it went immediately into bronchial infection. Rushed into hospital last Saturday as I was seriously bad. Home Now but still reeling from the last week. Bone aches getting me down. I refused the steroids as their side effects were giving me dreadful headaches. Feeling fed up with it all. Be careful that you are well before you have chemo. Good luck to everyone Xxxxxx",

      "Content": "Hi, Baby wipes are a must. My surgeon doesn't use drains but pj's are better and more dignified. Slippers are a must, I took a dressing gown but left it behind as it reminded me too much of hospital. I should have gone to primark. Fruit sweets, jellies were fab as the morphine affected my taste. I had a really good experience after being diagnosed. I did not have any symptoms, no lump so it was a shock that I had two types of cancer, mastectomy immediate reconstruction. I think it's hitting me now while I am having chemo as I am emotional, not like me at all. Best wishes and surround yourself with happy people. Xxx ,",
