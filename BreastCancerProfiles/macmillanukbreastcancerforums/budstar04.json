      "Content": "Hi just wondering if anyone has had a triple positive result.  I finally got my hormone receptor results through yesterday and yet again it seems to me to be another kick in the teeth.  The consultant said this just proves how aggressive it is and when pushed for some statistics he told me that without drug therapy and just the chemo and rads I had a 20% chance of spread.  Even after 8 x chem, 5 weeks of rads, herceptin and tamoxifen I still have a 10% chance of spread.  I am going for a CT scan and MRI today and praying that there has been no spread already. So very down at the moment - even spent all night in bed thinking of things I need to do such as power of attorney and funeral, etc.  Dramatic I know but I just feel this is the beginning of the end.  ",

When I first started I felt very unwell, dizzy, sick and exhausted. I wasn't sure if it was an after effect of the chemo or the Tamoxifen or in fact the rads which I started the same day as the Tamoxifen but I found the odd feelings disappeared after about 3 weeks and I feel fine now.

I had mine fitted a few days before my first chemo and my hair fell out 17 days after my first chemo. I alternate between my wig and scarves as I don't find it that comfortable.

I had a horrendous chest infection with me ending up on strong antibiotics just prior to my op. My dad had died 5 weeks previously and I developed the chest infection the day after the funeral and didn't get shot of it until a couple of days before my op. They will probably do a chest x-ray as standard and may do other tests if needed. I needed to know that my bc hadn't spread, even after having a negative snb so I was given MRI, CT and bone scan.
