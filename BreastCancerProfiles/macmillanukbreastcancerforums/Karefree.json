      "Content": "Hi Bet E4 I had a right mastectomy last July, asked my surgeon at the time if he would remove both breasts as I did not want to be lopsided (am an f cup) but he said no as he would not remove healthy tissue.   After completing chemo & radiotherapy in January I went back to see him in February to discuss my options, I explained that I still felt the same and would be happy flat, he agreed if I still feel that way when I see him in July he would be happy to remove my left breast. In the meantime I have spoken to the breast care nurses who've organised my psychological assessment so I have my ducks in a row when I see the surgeon. I have no doubts about this decision, am looking forward to revamping my wardrobe and wearing dainty bras with knitted knockers when I want a little shape.  It will be a fabulous change from the scaffolding I've needed since I was 14!  Am 50 now.   I am lucky my husband is absolutely on board, he's been amazing throughout my cancer journey. There is definitely not enough discussion about living flat, everyone seems to assume that reconstruction is the way forward, but I feel my body has been through enough.   Can't wait for the next phase of my life to begin!  Karen x",

      "Content": "Thanks for the tip Evie,  I'll give cherry juice a try. Currently take Max Strength Glucosamine & Chondroitin from Boots which does help (it is literally in all my joints, was struggling to function) but willing to try anything to improve the situation further! Another useful cookbook is I Quit Sugar Simplicious by Sarah Wilson. I liked her other book so decided to buy this one as well, I wasn't disappointed. Good Luck x",

      "Content": "Hi I was having a similar issue and decided to try a sugar free diet. I did a fair bit of reading first and borrowed a couple of books from the library for recipe ideas. The Sugar Free Family Cookbook by Sarah Flower & I Quit Sugar for Life by Sarah Wilson. Both of which I have now purchased along with a couple of others. My logic was that if I eliminated the sugar cravings / highs and lows sugar causes, then I might get my urge to binge under control. For me it has worked with the added benefit of less hot flushes. Don't get me wrong when I have a flush I could still power the national grid but I am most definitely having less of them. Have more energy too which is an added bonus as I was struggling with fatigue. Next phase of my plan is to research the do's and don't's of eating for arthritis to see if I can ease my aching joints through diet. Hope you find something that works for you. Karen xx",

      "Content": "Hi Londonlass 6 months in to Anastrozole I sympathise. Hot flushes from hell, I thought menopause had been bad but these are even worse. As for the pain and stiffness it started in my ankles, it's now literally in all my joints. Was struggling to walk, some days couldn't eat as the pain in my jaw was so bad, everything I tried to do was excruciating! So I went to see a practitioner breast care nurse for a chat, she was brilliant.  Recommended I try taking Glucosamine. Went home and did my research, www.arthritisresearchuk.org was a great source of information to work out dosage needed. As when I started to look at products available the differing dosages was confusing! ! For the last 3 weeks I have been taking Boots MAX STRENGTH GLUCOSAMINE & CHONDROITIN (1500mg Glucosamine, 1200mg Chondroitin)comes in both tablet and liquid form, I'm using the liquid, it has a pleasant blackcurrant flavour.  I drink a glass first think in the morning 10ml into 200ml of water. I was amazed, within 4 days the pain had lessened. I'm still stiff when I wake up but I'm no longer waking up during the night due to the pain, am able to do things during the day again, sewing,  gardening etc which I had abandoned as too painful.  If I do too much am quite sore during the evening's but nothing a couple of aspirin can't take care of. (I was living on aspirin before starting the glucosamine). Have no idea if this will help anyone else but for me it has made a massive difference. Karen",
