      "Content": "Hello everyone , my name is Carol and newly diagnosed (sounds like an AA meeting) I am due surgery this Thursday  lumpectomy  and SNB . Not really been told time scales except that results 2/3 weeks. Does this mean that oncologist has seen them , do you see oncologist when getting your results, and if so does he give CT dates. Btw I have triple+ . I have a cruise booked for week on 16th Feb.  Does it hurt to delay chemo if date given before this.  I haven't cxlld it yet. So many????? And no answers just pre-empting. Also have worked out some abbreviations but not all. X ",

At my original appt before surgery was told that because tested her2 pos that would need chemo/herceptin. The surgeon today said that because lump was small and everything clear that chemo might not now be needed and that onco will discuss next step. Has this ever happened to anyone else. Used that predictor and only 3% difference on 5 year prognosis.  ",

Perhaps it's all in my head however th e pain is real . The Nurse said did I want to leave th e dressing off to lwt the air get to it. I declined that option suppose they not really trained in breast ops. ",

Day 14 saw hair shedding at alarming rate.  Couldnt stand it any more . Even my lady hair has gone. Saw my onco yesterday who says having the injection to boost my WBC so hopefully preventing a hospital visit. Fully aware of the pain that it can cause. So must make sure that I have enough codeine to cope with it. ",
