    "Content": "I had a bilateral double mastectomy just over 4 weeks ago. I have a small seroma on my left side. It seems to be draining down my side and into my groin, so right down my side and groin feels tender and bruised. My nurse said it was nothing to worry about and should naturally absorbe into my body. I\u2019m also struggling with my physio, which seems to aggravate the seroma. My right side is healing well, but the mobility in that arm is much stiffer. Between the two they put me off doing the more advanced physio. I\u2019m managing the warmup and the basic ones. Has anybody had the same experience or any suggestions?",
