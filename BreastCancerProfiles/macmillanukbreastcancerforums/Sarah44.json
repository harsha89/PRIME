      "Content": "So pleased to hear from you again and that you have such a strong team around you.... I don't know whether you are in to such things but sometimes meditation can be helpful in balancing energies ..... sorry hope I don't sound bossy... I am a GP and somehow I am finding it very difficult to transform into a patient despte the gruelling treatments I have been through...... I have found meditation and spiritual healing have really helped me..... SarahXX",

      "Content": "Hello Cleo Only to say how sorry I am to read your message and how difficult it must all be for you at the moment. Have you thought about contacting support organisations like The Haven  http://www.thehaven.org.uk/about-us or Breast Cancer Care http://www.breastcancercare.org.uk/breast-cancer-services/talks-courses-local-support/living-secondary-breast-cancer ... You may be lucky and have a BCN with specialist skills in secondary breast cancer but I think they are still few and far between.... it all sounds like a complete nightmare ..... keep posting \u2013 you will get amazing support from all of us ...

I don't suppose you feel up to looking at it at the moment but others may.... the detail of it all is in the document right at the bottom of the  page with a vision of how things could be..... XXXX",

      "Content": "Hi Leigh.....l'm sure the crystal healing will be amazing for you and probably very similar to the spiritual healing I'm having- to be honest it is all partly about what ever comes up for you and also needs to be local..... I've had chemotherapy and mastectomy with axillary node clearance and am waiting for radiotherapy..... I am - of course- hopeful that the treatment will control my disease but am very aware that microscopic spread may already have happened.... the change of thinking  in the link I gave you is about looking at cancer as an ongoing condition rather than focusing on the initial treatment and then leaving us all to rather fend for ourselves until we spot a problem..... this is where some of the funding has come from for places like The Haven.....really wishing you well on your journey and keep in touch ...
