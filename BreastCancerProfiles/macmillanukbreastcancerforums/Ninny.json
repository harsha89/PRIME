    "Content": "Hi,  I've been on letroaole for 2 months following diagnosis of secondary breast cancer in my sternum, spine and lung. I have started to feel a sort of ripping or tearing sensation in my sternal tissue when rolling over in bed. I have also got pain and sensativity in this site. I did nothave any pain at all before starting treatment. The tumour feels smaller to me (fingers corssed!). Has anyone else had these symptoms?  Thanks in advance for any responces, I will look later as i'm going to make the most of the bank holiday and get my self outside to soak up the vitamin D :-) ",
