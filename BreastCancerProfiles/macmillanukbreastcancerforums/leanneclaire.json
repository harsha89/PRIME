      "Content": "Hi Cerijune, I too was diagnosed (in November) with grade 3 cancer - invasive ductal cancer with no DCIS and one node in my armpit. My doctor didn't explain what this meant so I had to look it up! It is true that you feel you are on an emotional rollercoaster to begin with and in some ways you feel like you're in a bubble - it doesn't seem real and you don't quite believe it is happening to you!! Well that is how I felt! However I found once a treatment plan was devised and chemo treatments started you seem to get into a routine and know what to expect! Everyone's treatment plans and side effects are different - for example I noticed that many ladies have had their operations first, whereas mine will be after chemo has finished. From what I have managed to research I think I was offered chemo first as my cancer was no DCIS which meant it had the potential to spread (or that is what I have come to understand in my research). The doctor initally said he wanted to try to shrink the 45cm lump to aim for breast conserving surgery but I have since been told by my oncologist that I need to be prepared for a full mastesctomy (even if the lump shrinks) as at my age (40) there is a high risk that cancer could return in the future! So not sure what to think now! I am half way through the chemo cycle (just had 4 FEC chemos and now will have 4 Tax). The last paragraphs of Ellen's message are so true, you get some bad days but many more good days. You will just need to rest when you need to on the bad days and make the most of the good days! At the beginning of my diagnosis, it seemed like it was going to be a long hard struggle and here I am half way through chemo already! I hope all goes well for you and look forward to hearing from you in the future to see how you are getting on! Take care and best wishes. Leanne xx",

      "Content": "Hi June, just had 4th cycle of FEC at home and am glad I chose that option. My first chemo cycle was at a local health centre but I decided to have the remainder at home. The nurses are so friendly and I always have company from a family member. I must admit it is a lot less stressful than travelling to my hospital - the parking is terrible and also my husband is self employed so cannot easily take time off to be with me. It fits perfectly to my lifestyle. Just have to get through the side effects as they have gradually got worse with each cycle - nausea and fatigue! I also had a PICC line inserted in my arm to avoid any leakages into the veins as the nurse said FEC could be dangerous to the veins and surrounding tissues! It is a lot better than having to endure a cannula being put in through a vein each time!! The only complication I had with that was I had a blood clot which is now being treated with daily injections for the remainder of chemo! My belly looks like a pin cushion! My poor husband has to do it as I hate needles! Anyway, I hope your first cycle at home goes well, and look forward to hearing about how it went. Take care and best wishes. Leanne xx",

      "Content": "Hi Kerry. I am on FEC and although not using the cold cap (my oncologist didn't rate it much), I have suffered with headaches and sickness, and which after my 3rd cycle have progressively got worse! I was prescribed Cyclizine to combat this. Hope this helps and best of luck to your friend. I hope she gets through this ok! Best wishes. Leanne",
