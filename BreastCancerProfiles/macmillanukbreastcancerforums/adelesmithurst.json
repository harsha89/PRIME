      "Content": "Oh my god, I think I must have just wrote this blog cos it is just how I feel. I'm 36, was 35 when I was diagnosed last June. I have had my surrgery, chemo finished radio 2 weeks ago, started tamoxifen 6 weeks ago and are due to start herceptin in the next couple of weeks. I too are finding the hot flushes hard to handle. I really don't no how we get over this feeling, maybe it is just a natural course after every thing we have been through. Maybe we could stay in touch even if it is just as herceptin buddies. It's shitty what has happened to us but immsure we will get through it I think this is just a lull we have hit. Keep your chin up we can do this. Adele. Xx",

      "Content": "Thanks everybody for your replies, I think I'm going to make an appointment with the doctor. I think what I find hard is not being back to normal. You kinda think that after the chemo everything will be ok but it's just not. I keep trying to convince my self that I am ready to go back to work (I've been off since last June) but in actual fact it just wouldn't be possible as I still get tired and quite honestly my head is in the wrong place. I feel like I'm letting people down as the see that I \"look\" better I should be better. Janice I really struggled with the chemo and by number 5 I thought I was going to die, I actually told the hospital I couldn't have the last dose, they were really good about it and told me that it wasn't the end of the world if I didn't. If for some reason yours is delayed don't worry about it take the time to let your feelings out. I hope your doctor is understanding (I think they will be) and gives you something to help you out. Keep in touch. Chin up we can do this we can't let the bugger get us down....(easy to write I no). Take care xx Adele",

I booked lunch for Wednesday with some old work buddies, had coffee with my chemo buddy today and have arranged to meet mum every morning to take dog for a walk. It might not sound much but it gets me out, and do you no what, I feel tons better. It's a cliche I no but use your friends, thats what they are there for and it really does help.",

No wonder you say your not coping well, you have been through so much it's hardly surprising. I bet you are actually coping a lot better than you think. Have you spoke to your breast care nurse and told her how you are feelin? Sometimes just telling someone how you are feeling really helps. I really hope you get your arm sorted and that things start easing up soon. You have got this far you are doing well, just remember that. Keep strong. Adele",

      "Content": "Hi there, Just wondered if anyone had any experiance with herceptin. I finished my chemo in December and really struggled with that. The steroids gave me hallucinations, so I was taken off them, the EC made me really ill and I had such a severe reaction to docitaxcil that I had difficulty breathing, lost my sight and hearing (luckily this was only temporary and all returned as soon as they stopped the drug) and was not aloud another dose. I'm now on Tamaxifen and I'm suffering bad with hot flushes. I'm just worried that as my reactions have been so bad to everything else will I react to the herceptin? Has anyone else been allergic to herceptin? What side effects have people suffered from? I no everyone is different but just wondered what other people's experiances were. Adele",

Been for scan and everything was ok. Was told it was just my boob recovering from all the trauma. Hopefully with time it will wear off. Hope your ok....adele",
