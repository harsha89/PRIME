    "Content": "Just a word of advice by the way I finished my RT this week and have booked my post-treatment holiday for Crete next month.Â  On my way home from my last treatment I stopped off at a travel shop and bought myself a couple of SPF Factor 50 t-shirts. Like many of you I too was advised not to sunbathe for at least a year and I will use high-factor suncream, but I thought having the t-shirts would help as well. These are generally available in good outdoor shops.",
