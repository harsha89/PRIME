      "Content": "Hi Anneliese Not sure whether you want to know what type of hormone therapy you're asking about. If it is it'll more than likely be tamoxifen (because you're pre-menopausal). I was on it for nearly 10 years but it was the chemo that induced the menopause not the tamoxifen. Hope this helps.",

      "Content": "The only thing I would comment on from the above posts is that although it's spread to some of your nodes it doesn't necessarily mean it's 'spread' to other parts of your body. I know a lot of ladies within our support group have had node involvement but it hasn't spread to anywhere else. Hope this helps - this can be overload time. Sometimes a breast care nurse sits in with you and writes things down (not always though) plus whatever chemo you will be on you'll be given a factsheet about that particular one. Never be scared to ask questions, especially when you're in the chemo suite because it's run of the mill for them Also mets means that it has spread to lungs, liver, bone and spine (not just collarbone etc) but don't even think about that. To have Herceptin means that you are HER2+ and these are the only ladies who will be offered Herceptin. I'm estrogen receptive plus BRCA2 (the faulty gene) but not HER2+ Good luck.",

      "Content": "Hi Chris I was originally diagnosed in 1995 and have been living with both spine and liver secondaries for the past 4 years. I'm not on Herceptin (as I'm not HER2+) but have been on capecitabine (without a break) for the past 2 years. I was told 2 years ago (just prior to taking the chemo) that I had 3 months to live and I think they got that a bit wrong! Ultimately I suppose we're all 'terminal' but no one knows how we're going to respond to treatments (as has been my case) and I hope your sister also responds well. There are a lot of people living far longer now with secondaries than there used to be and a lot of that is down to improved treatments. The one question I would ask is the hands and feet syndrome that many people seem to have problems with on capecitabine. I've been lucky in that I haven't had those symptoms but I do use a cream called Flexitol which can be bought over the counter. I would imagine she'll also be scanned somewhere down the road once she starts taking the chemo to see if the tumours are responding. I hope all goes well for your sister",

      "Content": "HI Anna I hope all goes well for you. It is a very frightening place to be knowing we have secondaries, especially in the early days but even now I still can feel vulnerable although I feel well at the moment. I used to have night sweats as well (which I think are different from hot flushes) plus feeling nauseous - have you got a Macmillan Nurse? If you haven't it might be an idea to ask your consultant (although I'm aware you've probably already seen him as I've also just gone onto this site for the first time this week). I've got one (although we've got this arrangement that I'll contact her if I need her) and she was very helpful when I was feeling really poorly. Let me know how you got on.",

      "Content": "I go for acupuncture about every couple of weeks (she was my physiotherapist at the hospital) and find that good. She mentioned to me about buying an iPOD shuffle and have favourite tracks on it so that you can listen to it as and when you want to. It's the increased heartbeats that I find difficult at times. I must admit it's on my mind quite a bit and I think it always is with mets. I went nearly 10 years with primary and it just wasn't part of my consciousness even though my mum and aunt died quite young of it (naive or what?!) I think they only tend to do radiotherapy to the bones if it's causing you a lot of pain. I had a fracture in my spine when first diagnosed with mets and they did emergency radiotherapy which was amazing. The latest lot (at the beginning of the year) was exactly the same. I tend to take cuprofen (the strongest you can get over the counter). I'm a bit light weight when it comes to painkillers because my surgery have prescribed me with various ones and I'm away with the fairies! I would imagine you're on Zometa (Zolandric Acid). This is what I was changed to at the beginning of the year as I was on Pamidronate before that and before that I was on Bonefos (which is a tablet form). I don't take anything special for my liver except I drink green tea (which my consultant suggested). Like you I eat healthily and am always aware of not putting undue pressure on my liver. I was off alcohol and coffee for 3 years mainly because my liver just didn't seem to be able to cope with it. I still can't drink white wine 'straight' so tend to have it with soda water but I don't drink a lot - probably 1 glass a week, sometimes not at all. My haemoglobin is quite low at the moment and I've been told by one of my health care friends to take Mackeson - sounds good to me and I take this every so often plus Crazy Jack apricots (for iron) and Green & Black's plain chocolate!!!! Entirely my choice - nothing that a dietician has said and am still just under 9 stone!!",

      "Content": "Thank you for your lovely post. I agree with you about feeling scared - it's a very scary place to be when you're first told. I hated going to bed because I was left alone with my thoughts but at least I knew that my heart worked as it was working over time! We do live with uncertainty when we've got secondaries but while I still feel relatively well I make the most of my time because I know if I become ill again I would be thinking all those months or years when I was feeling well and I didn't take advantage of them. Hope your radiotherapy goes well. You've certainly had a lot to deal with this year. Is the radiotherapy for your bones? I've had 3 lots over the last 4 years and it's certainly helped.",
