      "Content": "Good morning everyone, Have been staying away the last couple of weeks. Had 3rd EC on 3rd Dec and its taken a bit longer to bounce back this time. Went back to work on day 3 and felt floored day 4 -7. Feeling not too bad now. A bit of heartburn, blood in the nose and tired but otherwise fine. Final EC on 28th (so hibernating over New Year) and then Docetaxol, Herceptin and Perjeta starts at the end of Jan, for 4 x 3 weekly cycles. One of the reasons I've been staying away from here is I've been worrying to much about the new regime in January and really shouldn't be looking at everyone's SEs right now, and just deal with each day as it comes, along with the leaking roof, troubled youngsters and trying to get a cooker installed before Christmas. Getting used to life with next to no hair, and trying to regulate my body temperature. Haven't bothered with a wig, though I think if it was summer, I probably would.  Hope everyone is at least coping, We're definitely not alone in this!",

At the moment it's looking like final EC might be on Christmas Eve, which won't be great, but so be it. In January, I'll switch to 4 x Perjeta, Herceptin and docetaxel, followed by 14 further Herceptin., everything on 3 weekly cycles. Lots of folk mentioning taxol, but anyone else had this trio? Trying to blank it out, but am quietly dreading it.",

      "Content": "With 4th EC planned for 28th December, had catch up with oncologist on Tuesday. Tumour has shrunk by 1/3rd and is less defined, so it's good to know the chemo is doing its stuff. 4 x 3 weekly cycles of Herceptin, docetaxol and perjeta starting end of January. After that its surgery for lymph node and any remaining tumour, followed by radiotherapy. Thought I was getting 14 Herceptin only after that but it turns out its Herceptin and Perjeta, and then they just slipped in to the conversation that I will be getting hormone treatment for 10 years (can't remember the name), so that was a bit of a shock.  As I mentioned before, I 'm getting used to the next to no hair look, but has anyone any tips on how to make the scalp look less shiny? Its a bit of a dazzler especially with the Christmas lights about!",

In my mind, it's not cancer I'm struggling with (because I'm fortunate enough for it not to have affected my health so far, 'just a lump'), its the chemo. I've said that to a couple of folk and they think that if the cancer isn't bothering me, then how can the chemo possibly be a problem. There's a perception that I pick and choose what I do, after all how can I possibly be almost right as rain one week and then completely debilitated the next?",

If they message me, I either don't reply or just say, 'not too bad'. I just can't bring myself to tell them what the side effects are like as I don't want them to be upset. This community is the one place where I'm actually honest. My close family (ie the ones I live with) can see for themselves so there's no fooling them. I work somewhere that is seasonally open, so just now only have 1 colleague working with me, and she is an absolute star, and she just gives me 'that look' when she I tell her I'm ok, and is so quietly supportive, I couldn't ask for better. I just wondered if others were doing the same thing. Maybe if people like me were more honest, people would have a greater understanding of cancer and the rigours of treatment.",

      "Content": "Totally agree with the sentiments. People say they admire my positivity. Positivity is a mindset - they can't see inside my brain, which at some stages of the Docetaxol, herceptin, Perjeta cycle is a seething screaming angry exhausted mess. It's my fault for not saying anything but they don't know about the aches and pains, the fluid retention, constipation and bloating followed by explosive diarrhea, the exhaustion, the sleepless nights, the self-conscious old baldy woman feeling, the vile tastes in the mouth, the leg cramps, eye twitches and sore nails, the nose bleeds and the mouth ulcers. Have I missed anything? Why don't I tell them - because it's not what they want to hear and it's not going to make anyone feel any better. Last cycle a couple of relatives messaged me to ask how I was, for once instead of saying 'fine' I mentioned i was struggling a little. One said 'oh but you're in good hands' and the other said,' well look forward to it being over soon'. So back on with the positivity and I'm sure I'll kick cancer's ass and keep everyone happy. ",

This is the last cycle, and so I just have to wait for it to pass. Then there's 14 cycles of Herceptin etc to deal with. It only seems 5 minutes ago I was sitiing here terrified looking at chemo posts back in October. I'm not going to lie, it's been tough, and I really don't know how folk who are ill, or have young children, or a whole raft of other problems find the strenght to get through it. I feel lucky.  The big point, my mammogram and ultra-sound yesterday show no tumour. MRI today and then getting geared up for surgery/radoptherapy next month. Again, I'm lucky, but I really hope that this gives encouragement to those of you going through this process. For fear of boasting, in my case, it looks worthwhile. Stick it out ladies. It's all for a reason.",

Originally it was supposed to be surgery pretyy much straight away but after discovering it was Grade 3 a dn 2 lynoh nodes affected, the plan changed and I have just completed 4 cyels of EC. I will be moving on to Herceptin, Perjeta and Docitaxel this week. Take each step as it comes, don't think about the subsequent steps until you get to them. One of the worst things about chemo is waiting for your first one. Undergoing it is better than anticipating it. This forum is brilliant but don't search too much at this stage. Anything at all that's bothering you, just get on here. You won't be judged and someone will always be along to offer advice/love/support. Onwards and upwards xxx",
