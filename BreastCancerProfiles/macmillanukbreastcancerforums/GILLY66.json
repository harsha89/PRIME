    "Content": "Hi, granny Anny  , sorry I can't be of more help to you but I have had same thoughts . I was told that after chemo the likelihood is there won't be much tumour if any left  ,but have been told I might still need a mastectomy. There was so much information given that day that I forgot to ask, but will be interested to see if anyone has any information on that. Sending you gentle hugs and happy thoughts  X",
