      "Content": "Thanks Dreamthief, i think compared with others on the site I've got off relatively lightly, I never realised how complex the mix of primary and secondary cancers were. i shouldn't have been so dismissive of the new side effects, they change every time and last week were a bit grim, my bilirubin and liver markers were better last week and I see my onchologist this friday so should get a better idea of the new plan or if it continues without the irinotecan. all the best to everyone.",
