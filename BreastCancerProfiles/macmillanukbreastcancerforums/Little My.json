      "Content": "Hi there, I don't have breast cancer (anal cancer) but i am Scandinavian. They are perfectly open about it and would not blink twice about you...I know people with mastectomies who sunbathe topless on the beach.No one bats an eyelid really.   It takes a bit of nerve to do it the first time I guess, wherever you live... at least I know it did for me with my scars... I had a colostomy (now reversed) and was nervous about showering with my bag on especially in front of kids and also my scar which is pretty horrid looking. Children actually care less than adults I find and are not scared. One little girl asked me what my bag was once. I told her in simple terms. She said Oh ok... and off she skipped. No fear, just curiosity and I think it is good for them to see these things so they are not hidden away (though it takes courage of course)  I think the Danes would understand you showering in your cossie and would be fine about it and I am sure others would do the same and they would also be fine about you showing your scars. They are not all beautiful btw...:D  I could say the same having just come home from the gym with all these gorgeous young girls with their perfect bodies here in the UK. You do whatever you feel most comfortable doing, and they will understand, we are caring friendly open people. There is a joke in Scandinavia though that you know where they are from by the clothing... Norwegians wear a bikini, Swedes go topless, Danes go naked! Hope you enjoyed your holiday and you go back again soon Little My x",

      "Content": "I could be cheeky and say all us Scandinavians are devilishly gorgeous but honestly, you probably picked a bad day cos we aren't! Plenty of lumpy bumpy people around...  but they are less embarrassed and that is maybe it. DO go to Sweden with your kids. It is such a child friendly place and the outdoor swiming etc lifestyle is perfect for them (I've just got back from 2 weeks in sweden with my family) I think it is a state of mind and we think people are looking at us much more than they are... it is hard to get over it, but it gets better the more you do it. I quite happily show my scar now after crying the first time... glad to see another Moomin fan around :) LM xxx",

Someone told me it lasted about 2 years... I am embracing my curls and grown my hair a bit longer than usual because of them... I'm hoping they will last longer than 2 years now as i rather like them. My friend who had different chemo again also has grown back curly... and said there was a phrase chemo-curls... Hope you enjoy them LM x",

      "Content": "Dear knotofpeace, I don't have breast cancer, (I have anal cancer) but saw your post and thought oh I was longer so popped in to answer you. It may be different for breast cancer, if so, please ignore me...   I was told i had cancer on the 9th March. my treatment did not start until 9th May so a two month wait. I had various scans and planning meetings etc beforehand. Eeach scan had a wait attached even though I was classed as urgent and I had what my consultant called a 'hefty' tumour and worries about spreads here there and everywhere. so it seemed panic urgent to me but urgent to them had a different pace to mine. I wanted treatment to start the next day... they seemed to think it was fine to wait a couple of weeks here there and everywhere.... when you are waiting, it seems too long and you worry it is growing and growing away.... cancer and its treatment seems to have its own timescale that is different to ours. My first post treatment check up, it was too scarred and swollen for him to check so he just said oh go away and come back in a month and I'll try again then and if I still can't, then I'll send you off for an anaesthetic. I was thinking but my tumour might be there and you don't know.... and a whole month??? Anyway, 6 months down the line, here I am. Currently no sign of the tumour or any new spread and I am starting to not panic about times so much now.... I know it is so so hard when you are in it, but I took the time to wait as reassuring as if they were not in such a hurry, then it was probably not about to kill me if that makes any sense. You have got a long journey ahead of you so I am sending you a big big hug to help ease the anger into strength for what lies ahead... wishing you all the best Little Myx",

      "Content": "Scarlett, I understand completely how you feel. I have anal cancer though, but wanted to reply as to the liver bit...  I was told I had innumerable lesions on my liver. All over it. Then they said probably ok and scan in 6 months and of course as the scan date comes you worry and every ache etc makes you nervous. I then had a scan and he's fairly confident that it was not mets. So I uber analyse what he meant by fairly... and then next scan he says oh yes, we were tracking your liver and that nodule on your lung weren't we... wtf? so now I worry about my lung before every check up. I am over a year after treatment and they are now saying they think that they might just be freckles on the inside as he put it and just stuff. So, please try not to worry too much, though of course you will. It can sound like the end of the world and its not in the end. And the way I look at it is this... If you worry for 2 weeks and its fine, then what a waste of all that time worrying over nothing, and if its not ok, then you shouldn't waste 2 weeks worrying about things and enjoy yourself instead cos worrying doesn't do any good whatsoever and whatever happens you will deal with because you will and can, same as you have dealt with things so far and it will be ok. Worrying won't change it either way. I would say though that livers aren't usually the first places to spread to from the breast so probably fine and they are doing belt and braces checks with you... same as with me. and one cyst is treatable so take a few deep breaths and remember you are listening to a woman with innumberable spots on her liver, who is home from working full time and a swim. big hug to you Little My xxx  ",
