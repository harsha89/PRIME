      "Content": "Hello Jules  -  just caught up with this thread. I am of the \"sailing through\" variety except for a few small things. I haven't had chemo but my hair is thinning since I have been on Tamoxifen.  Similarly my nails which are usually very strong and attractive are breaking and splitting. I have been on Tamoxifen for 15 months and have had possibly two night sweats, that's all, and because I have Type 2 diabetes I have to control it by diet so eat fairly healthily and I haven't gained an ounce by sticking with my usual regimen which I was already doing before I got bc. Hoping that good news story will lift your spirits because to me taking Tamoxifen is like taking a couple of Panadol, causes me no concern at all.  Clear your mind of everything you have been told because I sometimes think that preconceptions and scary feelings about something almost guarantee that you'll feel them. Keep an open mind and I hope you will be one of the success stories. PS:  Of course we should all be aware of the truly bad effects like dvt and uterine cancer that can be caused by Tamoxifen but I believe that is quite rare and naturally I am talking about the less serious  but nonetheless troublesome ones that seem to bug some people. Good luck and keep us posted, Renée",

      "Content": "\"a benign mass or lump.....mobile and painful........while the malignant lump is not\" My 'malignant lump' and my whole breast ached like hell - fortunately I only left it two weeks before going to the doctor because I was not about to take as gospel that a malignancy does not cause pain. My GP and I discussed this very issue and she said that there is a myth around the subject of \"if it's not painful it's not cancer'\" I have not read your link and don't know whether you are a surgical oncologist or not. My experience only - offence not intended!!! Renée",

      "Content": "Not to have had any response at all to my last post here. Surely in the land of brreast cancer sufferers there is someome else who has suffered pain which led to a consultation and a subsequent diagnosis?? I am really quite upset that some who are suffering pain in their breasts will go along with what the poster before me said and continue with the erroneous impression that pain in the breast is not breast cancer. This is a huge disservice to women. For heaven's sake - the person who posted that has not even thought it appropriate to at least come back and debate the issue!! Who accepts a throwaway post by who knows who, and it seems I am about the only one prepared to take them on and query what they say. Come on girls - surely to God you have something to say - I don't care if you shoot me down - just shake a leg and give some responses here - or is anyone prepared to take a gamble and believe that if your boob - or someone else's you care about - has pain and you tell them - \"it's ok, it's not malignant - I read it on WhatNow\"",

      "Content": "Hello again Jules, Yes the hair thinning is manageable and I think I'm more aware of it than anyone else simply because of the amount on my comb or hairbrush.  I have no bald patches or anything but my hairdresser and I have both noticed a huge difference in thickness since I started Tamoxifen,  However she assures me there is new growth as well so I can live with that. I was very worried about having to go through chemo but because the Sentinel Nodes they removed were all clear it was deemed that I should have radiotherapy (18 sessions) and Tamoxifen - no chemo!!  If you came through that well Jules I can't think you would have a problem with Tamoxifen!  Strange how we all fear different aspects of treatment isn't it? Anyway do keep us posted won't you and I hope that 2010 is the year that every one of us is able to rise above this wretched disease. Warm regards, Renée  ",
