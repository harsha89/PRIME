      "Content": "Hi JoDec Thanks for the advice.  I have been to see the Oncologist today and had my bloods checked.  I have low calcium and potassium.  They have given me a 5 day course of tablets (one set for each).  I did tell him about my twitching eye as well.  Really appreciate the advice - thank you.  Glad to hear you are doing ok.   Its the first time I have had a problem with my bloods.  I am having cycle 5 next tuesday and they are reducing the dose for me as I have struggled the last 2 cycles with taste buds and not eating (lost over a stone).  I am new to this site but its great to hear from others and I really appreciate any advice. ",

      "Content": "Hi Lady Penelope I have recently had my 4th TCHP chemo and have also been wiped out. Got up yesterday and did a little round the house - was not a good idea so back to bed today. Last 2 chemo's have been horrible on my taste buds and eating.  Have lost alot of weight as virtually nothing tastes good.  Will be 2 weeks on tuesday since my chemo.  I have also developed twitching eyes in the last week as well.  As you say though 2 to go.  Best of luck x",

      "Content": "Hi Sorry to hear about everything you are going through but thanks for sharing.  Hope you don't mind me asking, I am due to go to see my consultant tomorrow to discuss my right side mastectomy (having finished my 6th and last TCHP chemo last Tues).  I am just trying to get my head round what to expect and noticed you mentioned food tasted YUK.  I know it seems odd to focus on that but I am currently struggling with the side effects on chemo and it's been really difficult each cycle.  I didn't expect taste problems after the op. I am being a bit thick but what causes this?  I| appreciate the other advice thanks and wishing you well with your recovery you sound like you are doing well x",

      "Content": "Hi Maxieboy Just reading your post and I feel for you.  I have just completed 6 cycles of TCHP and was exactly the same.  I was very positive and then the  chemo hit.  All I can say is just go with how you feel, make sure you rest when you feel you need to, don't be hard on yourself - you are brave and are entitled to whinge (it does no harm and makes you feel better to get it out) and last of all it will end.  Yes you have to do it all again the next cycle but I promise you will do it.  I tried to rationalise it out the same way you had but you don't need to apologise for how you feel.  Its 3 weeks since my final chemo and I am feeling better, heading in the right direction and although not back to normal yet feel I am on the right side of things.  Sending you best wishes for the rest of your treatment.",
