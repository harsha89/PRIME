    "Content": "Rosie1947 Yes thank you, I've already discovered this. Prognosis seems quite positive as far as I can ascertain, but I don't know my K167 result, so that may have a significant impact. Something I'll ask Oncologist. I want/need to have as much relevant information as I can get, in order to make decision after our little chat. Hi Rosie, I have the same predicament. I am 43 had a tiny 7mm lump removed with clear margins, sentinel lymph node removal found no lymph involvement thankfully. It has been recommended to me that I have radiotherapy and Tamoxifen for 5 years. Obviously I don't want a reoccurrence but I have the same concerns as you as in side effects of medication and I'm also worried about the possible late effects of radiation. I meet with the oncologist next week so hopefully I can make an informed decision.Â  It's a confusing time x",
