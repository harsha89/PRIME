    "Content": "Hi Cathy I had a left side mastectomy with immediate reconstruction with expander implant at the end of November. Just to reassure you I've had two fills in addition to what was added at the time of my 2 ops (also needed an axillary node clearance) and have had minimal discomfort. There was some delay with my fills starting as the stitches over my port site opened up following the first surgery, the wound went necrotic and the port had to be moved slightly. I was very nervous about my first fill but can honestly say apart from a sharp scratch when the needle goes in it was surprisingly pain free. My second fill was last Friday which took me to 370cc and again it was fine - I hope it will be the same for you! Good luck tomorrow Lee",
