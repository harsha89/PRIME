      "Content": "Hi, I wouldn't think too much about the odds -you never know which side you'll fall. After mamogram & ultrasound I was told 99% not cancer and the biopsy was to confirm. So two practically worry free weeks later I went back to have the wind totally knocked out of me. Since I wasn't expecting bad news I'd gone on my own. Take someone with you - they can hold your hand or share the relief. Either way the waiting is the worst bit emotionally and we all get through it somehow. ",

      "Content": "Hi All, thanks for the support.  Got the results of my lymph node biopsy today and they are affected too so they'll all need to come out and then we see where we go next.  Feels like yet more bad news and it's difficult not to let my mind jump ahead.  Surgery due on 14 Jan and then two weeks for the results.  Just want to get all this over with and it's good to hear from people who've trod this path before.  Heart goes out to all those just beginning.  I keep telling myself it's treatable.  This is so hard.",

      "Content": "Hi, got diagnosed with Grade 2 invasive ductal carcinoma (ER +ve) on 22nd December.  Obviously a complete shock as up until the biopsy we all thought the lumps were harmless.  Had some thickening of lymph nodes so they've been biopsied too.  Just really scared.  I'm 43, I've got two children (11 & 9) and a great husband and i don't want to leave them.  Tips on positivity gratefully received.",
