      "Content": "Hi Lemongrass, I am about to embark on my first FEC due the 13th or 14th was ment to be Friday the 10th but I'm going to assist with 2 clinical trials so it delayed the start...im a bit apprehensive about it but I too took some control back and went & got me hair cut short. Will be keen to monitor ur progress through this as I too seem to have the same cycle but my operation is going to be at the end of chemo. We are attending the Genetics clinic to get tests done to see if I have the gene if so then its a double mastectomy waiting for me at the end if not then a lumpectomy will suffice... I hope everything goes well for you & Anna K  Take care lits of hugs  Angie  ",
