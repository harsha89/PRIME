    "Content": "Talking about lack of information!  I finished chemo, but will stay on Herceptin, had surgery to remove breast and lymph nodes, back to theatre 2 days later for evacuation of haematomas, had 3 units of blood, drains removed 4 days later and allowed home that day, i.e. a week today.  Went to clinic yesterday to let them see wound sites.  I told them I'd found 2 large lumps at surgical sites.  One on chest wall. the other, very large, under my arm where any type of bra would have to sit across!  A lot of tightness and pain.  Out comes a large bore needle and syringe from my Specialist??!! Nurse!  She starts to aspirate off fluid.  I have hardly known such pain!  I have no padding at all, just ribs, I've always been skinny.  I'm back to square one today with various lumps, tightness and pain.  Paracetemol just isn't working!  She told me over the phone today that she wasn't surprised, and that it would probably need done 2 or 3 more times!  No way!  No one ever mentioned anything about this at any time.  After coming through all that stuff, I think I'd rather put a damned gun to my head!  Has anyone else experienced this please?  I really cannot bear this.",
