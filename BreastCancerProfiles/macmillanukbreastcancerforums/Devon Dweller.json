Well it went in on the 2nd attempt but where it went seems to be a mystery, 'Vanishes into the mist' was the phrase used. We'll have to get the oncologist to have a look, she'll be in Thursday, go home.  We're not so sure it had been there a long time, it was so large by the time it was discovered, and has seemingly grown rapidly since. Good luck with your treatment",

      "Content": "Letter to the GP from the 'Team' Dec 2015 \"We discussed your patient at our recent Multidisciplinary Team Meeting following the MRI scan of her pelvis, which was arranged by you as she presented with left hip pain. As you know she had locally advanced breast cancer, T3, NO, Grade 3 and underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy and subsequent mastectomy. Unfortunately the MRI scan suggested evidence of metastatic disease. The CA- 125 is also elevated. She had further imaging with a CT scan and this shows evidence of lymphadenopathy in her left axilla. The previous seroma in the right breast area, which was drained, seemed to have increased in size. There was evidence of mediastinal lymphadenopathy as well as a right upper lobe, 1.7 cm, soft, lobular mass, representative of a pulmonary metastasis. There was also irregularity of the liver suggestive of hepatic metastasis and extensive retroperitoneal adenopathy. There was extensive bone disease as described on the MRI scan. She has been referred for an Orthopaedic opinion and has also been referred to Exeter. The summary of the CT scan was marked progression with extensive left axillary, hilar, mediastinal and retroperitoneal adenopathy with lung, liver and bony metastasis. She also has masses in her ovaries which have been reviewed by the Gynaecology Team and are probably part and parcel of the same process. As mentioned, her CA- 125 was elevated. We felt she would need further assessment of her bony hip problems and possibly stabilisation and radiotherapy, further chemotherapy and a gynaecological opinion about the current situation. We would be happy to meet up with her at some stage when she is having further oncological assessment.\"",
