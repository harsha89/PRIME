I've seen teh histology report and teh margins of clear tissue were excellent - minimal 1cm of healthy tissue surrounding tumour. After initial panic, I saw the duty GP and he phoned surgeons secretary. I have an appointment first thing Tuesday to see surgeon to get it checked - unfortunately they are away on holiday until then. That is also the day I am due my first dose of chemo and I am concerned that this new lump will alter things. Does anyone have any similar experience? Tess x",

I had my surgeon and oncologist print out copies of the predictive tool they use to work out best course of treatment and likelihood of recurrence or dying from the breast cancer. It was quite reassuring for me to see that despite having a moderately aggressive tumour and lymph involvement it is still very likely that I will be cured and will be alive in ten years time. The tool called adjuvent online or a very similar one is used at all centres treating cancer so you could get yours - it might help put your mind at rest. Your breast care nurse could get you a copy. I think we just have to keep reminding ourselves that treatment has improved dramatically in the past five years and that most of us will be cured. Tess x",

During and since chemo I have been exercising quite a bit to get fitter - reduce risk of recurrence and menopausal symptoms etc. I started training fro Great South run and discovered resting heart rate was about 110 - far higher than expected. I spoke with my cardiothoracic physiologist who does my lng function tests and is a bit of an anorak about these things and he said that basically chemo causes a mild form of heart failure so the best cure is exercise and that it I kept going I would eventually bring it down a bit. A year since diagnosis and it is still high- resting rate this am at the gym was 95 but it goes up to about 150 as soon as I start running. i am just going to keep improving overall cardiothoracic function and hope it gradually decreases.

I am in a different boat to you, having had chemo after my op. This was because I did have spread to the lymph nodes rather than because I am being treated an you are not. I suspect you are fortunate in not needing chemo ( from a survival point of view rather than an enjoying the experience perspective). For me Chemo made a 26% increased chance of being alive at 5 years. No choice, I had to have it. I am sure your team will have used a similar tool to calculate the risk of chemo weighted up against the benefits before deciding you didn't need it. I think general knowledge around a subject can terrify us but truly believe it is essential to have as much detailed information as possible on our specific circumstances to help us cope and work with the medics to optimise our chances. If it is still all a foreign language to you, perhaps you should be asking for a more comprehensive and easily understood explanation from the surgeon/oncologist or breast care nurse. No question is too trivial or too stupid to be asked and you have a right to that information. Do you have their e-mail? You could send a list of questions and ask them to answer them. If not, ask for an appointment with the nurse. Whatever the treatment plan, you have more similarities than differences to each and every one of us. We all share your fears and hopefully can also share your celebrations. Go ask some specific and detailed questions. Tess x",

It doesn't actually take much longer as you have to hang around whilst they put lines in and get drugs from pharmacy etc. I had a wig fitted and ready to go - matched exactly to my style and colour so I coudl make the cahnge without anyone really noticing. My hair thinned and was a bit patchy for a few weeks when I did use my wig but I didn't come anywhere near losing it all. My hair started regrowing over thinned patches after I swopped from FEC to Taxotere and was soon at a point where I could have it restyled and highlighted so it looked like a conscious decision to have a new hairdo. It is cold ( take a couple of paracetemol half hour beforehand to stop headaches), wrap up in a blanket/woolly jumper and take a flask of hot drink. Take a large towel for around your shoulders so that you don't spend a couple of hours with freezing drips down your back and soaking clothes. You may have to be quite assertive to ensure the nurses leave it long enough before starting teh chemo infusion and leave it on long enough. Many don't believe it makes much difference ( although all the research suggests otherwise) and try to skimp on timings, thinking they are doing you a favour. I woud say if you are willing to persevere give it a go. Don't give up at first sign of hair dropping in shower and you will get back to looking like you a whole lot quicker. For me it was important I didn't look different - I wanted to work through chemo, be me for the kids and not tell that many people I was having treatment. Hair is the most obvious outward sign and it mattered a lot to me. I really couldn't do the 'cancer patient' look - I would have been treated differently at work and I didn't want that to happen. People say all sortsd of thinsg ' it will grow back quickly\" \" It's what is on teh inside that matters\" etc etc and they are right but if hair and your image is important to you then try to minimise the impact of cancer treatment. Buy a decent eyeliner to make up for the eyelashes you shed too. Hope it goes OK for you, Tess x",

When I was researching to try and preserve/encourage hair I discovered that far from using 'chemical free' organic type shampoos we should be using good old fashioned head and shoulders - high zinc levels encourage hair growth. They have one out called endurance which actively promotes growth. It also releives itchy scalp a bit. I suffered horribly with this and wanted soemthing to stop me looking like I had nits as I was scratching all the time and this, of course, can break the weakened hair shafts. Other than that, avoid direct sunlight but do keep scalp warm to ecourage blood supply and therefore growth. If you can afford a silk pillow case, it reduces hair breakage from friction. I seem to be curlier now than pre-chemo so it looks shorter than it actually is. I'm sure it will come soon through - although maybe not exactly as before for a while. It does drag the whole breast cancer experience out a bit. Tess x",

      "Content": "I have found two more lumps in the same breast since I was diagnosed. The first I discovered on the day I was starting chemo. Luckily my surgeon came in early and saw me at 7.30am about three quarters of an hour after I found it. It was an 'exploded milk duct' due to lots of years of feeding babies and poor lymph drainage after surgery. The second I found at the radiotherapy planning meeting and went straight from there back to the other hospital I attend to see the surgeon again and have an ultrasound. Luckily that was just a cyst formed on the scar line. It was scary at teh time though. I guess none of us can really make you feel better until y ou know for certain one way or another. I sincerely hope that,like my other lumps, it turns out to be benign and you can relax again. Tess x",

Losing a breast is a whole lot more serious than having a lump removed, both physically and emotionally. Ask you surgeon to show you the online tool they use to help determine which treatment is most appropriate for each person. It is called adjuvent online and will show you what the statistical chances of recurrence are with each treatment option and your five year survival chances with each treatment added in. I found it quite reassuring and my surgeon said that the outcomes in terms of life expectancy were exactly the same for lumpectomy and mastectomy. I think there is a panic reaction which says \"just get rid of it all\" but this isn't always the best course of action. Tessx",

      "Content": "Hello Fivejays, What a worrying time for you. I am convinced it is worse for partners than it is for the person going through it. The pre-op will do blood tests to make sure the blood count is fine for an operation and that their aren't any underlying things to worry about like diabetes that hasn't been diagnosed. She may have a chest x ray as this will show up most lung abnormalities and any problem with an enlarged heart or other chest infections etc. I didn't have CT scan for breast cancer as had already had loads for a lung condition. I don't think they are routine unless and abnormality is picked up on chest xray ( as lung secondaries would generally, be). CT scans are not without risk. It is thought my breast cancer was triggered by having to have lots of CT scans to the chest for a serious lung problem...The tumour grading isn't done until after it has been removed - the biopsy only gives an indication and the grading can change across the tumour. Mine was a mix of grade 2 and 3. When they have all the information from histology they put it in to an online tool called adjuvent online and this predicts how effective the treatments will be. It gives recurrence and survival rates based on your particular circumstances such as grade, lymph node involvement, underlying conditions, age etc. It also compares the rates if various treatments are completed either singly or individually and this helps the team decide whether the risks outweigh the benefits. He will also have had many years of clinical experience and would have a good idea about spread. Luckily your partners tumour is small. The outcomes for lumpectomy are as good as the outcomes for mastectomy but obviously you heal both physically and emotionally a lot better from the former. If she does have chemo she might find her Crohns improves as it is autoimmune in origin and the immune system is suppressed by the chemo. I have Lupus and felt better than I had for years when I finished chemo. Hope all goes well. Tess x",

I think it is really a couple of days after FEC you feel a bit grim ( not end of world though and getting up and doing something makes it feel better). Taxotere was later to kick in and I was able to work continually when on Tax as long as I had really good pain killers as although nausea and fatigue were not a problme bone pain was and I needed morphine and tramadol to enable me to sleep at night. If I had this then I was fine the next day on paracetemol and ibruprofen. The pain lasted about three days each cycle and started around day four. Radio I found much harder than chemo as it was the daily grind to the hospital, the feeling that you had become a carcass on a butchers slab and appointments all over the place making it harder to plan. I did work around it but there was much more juggling. Physically it didn't cause any problems apart from severe blistered and infected burns to my boob and neck which made the seat belt uncomfortable.

I had to go three times to my GP and be really pushy to get the referral I knew I needed. I'm awaiting results of bone scan but have a nasty niggle there is a problem from reaction of radiographer. My understanding is that although metastases can't be 'cured', in many cases they can be controlled for quite a long period of time especially in hormone receptor positive tumours. I have a friend who has had bone mets for seven years now and still generally feels OK and does all usual things except stuff like ski-ing where risk of fractures is high. Mine is very highly oestrogen and progesterone receptor positive and am keen to start something to reduce oestrogen levels but am told I have to wait until I see the oncologist - even though we all know I need it. Seems silly to me, the waiting around is by far the hardest thing for me. I want to get on and get sorted.

You think you know what is going on but don't really remember it or care. They freeze the back of your throat with a spray and tehn they put the tube down into your lungs. They may just look through the camera or they may take small biopsies. It doesn't hurt. Afterwards you need a few hours to come around and have to wait until your swallow reflex returns.

It passes very quickly and so long as you are fairly organised with things like menu planning and freezing meals for the couple of days each cycle when you probably won't feel like cooking then it is very manageable.

Yes you are uncomfortable for a few weeks but it is hardly a life long disability that reduces your mobility significantly. In fact, walking a bit further can do nothing but good. Leave the blue badges to those that really need them. You need to remind your husband you are not disabled, that exercise and normality are good for you and that blue badges are for people who can't walk more than 50 metres. Tess x",

It sounds a bit like a reaction to the steroids so maybe now you have finished chemo it will come off a bit quicker and the rash will disappear shortly. I suggest a trip back to Gp to get something to help the spots a bit more as they are so demoralising. Maybe some anti-histamines or some steroid cream. Aqueous cream is just going to clog up the pores and make it worse, I would have thought - unless you have eczema already. Weight gain may also be due to steroids and less activity. Weightwatchers sounds grim when tastebuds are funny anyway. Maybe be a bit gentler on yourself but start going for a walk or doing some form of exercise daily will help. It also helps with the fatigue and actually gives you more energy. Much better than dieting. Tess x",

      "Content": "I decided to go ahead with chemo as for me it was a 'no brainer' not to, once I had seen what percentage difference the various treatments made to me personally. Chemo for me meant a 38% increased chance of survival at 5 years. I have children and didn't like the idea of 'popping my clogs' so quickly so decided I had to concur and accept my oncologists offer. I didn't 'sail through' exactly although the everyday side effects were much less of a problem than I thought they would be and I continued to work right through treatment. However I had an armful of DVT's and had to give myself anticoagulant injections on top of the GCSF jabs every day for six months. I had neutropaenic sepsis twice and had to be admitted for IV antibiotics but soon got over this. I am well passed the hair regrowth stage now but am left with some permanant damage. One arm is bigger than the other from the effects of the DVT's - it is also a different colour and gets funny muscle spasms from time to time. I have had to swop my wedding ring to the other hand as it gets so swollen sometimes. I must be one of the few people who get what amounts to lymphoedema in the 'good' arm. Also, I am under the Brompton for some other lung problem and it now seems I have early heart failure probably due to chemo. This may affect my long term survival but has also given me a good hard kick and I am now obsessive about the exercise and healthy eating that I gave lip service to before. I am probably fitter than I have been for years and people tell me I look better, too. I am certainly more willing to take risks and have a more interesting life. Heart failure can be kept at bay nowadays and I can do much to stay on top of it. Breast cancer left without chemo would almost certainly have killed me much quicker. If I needed chemo again, would I ? Almost certainly. I also have two quite bad scars from radio, one on my boob and one on my neck that does show but I guess this is a small price to pay. The time when it impacts most really does pass very quickly. Other things can be dealt with as and when they appear. Tess x",

      "Content": "They can't give a definite grading until the lump is out but a best guess based on biopsy results. A grade one is the lease aggressive of all tumours so the rate of spread is slow. Whether it has spread to the lymph nodes will depend on how long it has been there and how large the tumour is. A grade one is very good news. Most women survive breast cancer these days. The most usual route of spread is to the lymph nodes in the armpit on the affected side. I suspect your sister may be offered a sentinel node biopsy where they inject a blue dye and see which lymph nodes it has spread to then just remove one or two and check it hasn't spread to them. If they are affected then more are often removed to reduce risk of recurrence or wider spread. If it seems likely that there is spread to the lymph nodes these may be removed by surgery in the armpit. It is rare for it to have spread elsewhere if it hasn't spread to the lymph nodes. I had bone scan and liver scan prior to surgery as mine was a higher grade. I don't think everyone does. If it is a small grade one tumour and in a 'good' place then a lumpectomy followed by radiotherapy for about six weeks is the usual treatment. The surgery is Ok really and I still like my boobs afterwards. I can still wear any skimpy bra and swimming costumes etc without any problem. My surgeon told me to bring in my tiniest bra on the day of surgery so she could check she mae the scar under the bra line. Recovery was quick and I went back to work in a few days. I did have a drain under my arm where the surgery to remove my lymph nodes was. This was fine but wouldn't have been a good look at work. Your sister may not even need as much as this and may just have day surgery and a see through waterproof dressing. Hope all goes well. Tess x",

My oncologist said it was because I had high oestrogen levels and my body was continually battling the chemo. I then had two fairly normal periods and then two months of spotting here and there once on tamoxifen. They have stopped completely now since about March/April time. I assumed menopaussal so talked to surgeon about contraception (she is the most sensible of my consultants). She did a hormone level test and it came back 'normal' ie although oestrogen levels low because of Tamoxifen, my FSH levels are still high so can still produce eggs so still need contraception. She said she was amazed and like me had I assumed it had triggered the menopause. I still have really hot moments at night sometimes. I would try not to worry too much - it has to be a really, really low chance of a cervical cancer and a breast cancer one after the other. Plus chemo would assumably have blasted any possible nasty cells in your nether regions. Tess x",

Exercise conversely, reduces the risk of cancer return significantly - well done to those who have managed the gym.

The shorter and layering bit is to allow the cold to get to the scalp - rest assured it reaches there regardless of hair length! It is better not to pull or tug hair with combs of brushes whilst on cold cap, so from this point of view shorter is more manageable. It really doesn't have to be a crew cut.

      "Content": "I am by no means a gym junky but I realised that I wanted to remain as normal as possible for my kids sake and that exercise was key to beating fatigue due to chemo and the best way or preventing recurrence. I carried on going to the gym three times a week - there were a couple of days each cycle when I couldn't and a couple of times I had neutropaenic sepsis I had to miss a few days. I also got loads of DVT's and had to miss a few days then too. It was sometime quite hard to motivate myself against the overwhelming tiredness towards the end of chemo but when I did get up and get going I always felt much better. I believe that it was the gym that allowed me to continue to work through chemo, too. People say 'listen to your body' but we have to remember it is not our bodies speaking but the chemo. I went to the gym four days after surgery too and have not had any complications at all - not underarm tightness or arm restrictions, no lymphodoema etc. There is really interesting research around a group of women with breast cancer who took up dragon boating post surgery and who despite vigourous exercise and long haul flights, have never had lymphodoema. I also used the cold cap - really long hair might be better cut shorter but you don't have to give yourself a 'number one' or short back and sides. Take paracetemol half hour before treatment to prevent headaches, have a towel for around your shoulders to stop icy water dripping down your back, a flask of hot drink and trashy magazines - it is hard to concentrate on proper reading. The best advice I can give is persevere - your hair will fall out in what looks like huge amounts, it will thin but as soon as you start Taxotere it will probably start growing back over the thinned areas and you will be back to normal far quicker and can get on with not being a cancer patient sooner.

I now have one arm bigger than the other, a different colour to the other and all lumpy - and that is my good arm! I ws in hospital earlier this year and needed IV's for scans etc but they couldn't get a line in so the radiologist said he would put a line in my node less arm. I kicked up. He told me I was 'being silly' that he was ' a consultant and knew about these things and it was perfeclty safe'. I pointed out he was a 'locum' for a reason and I was happy to go along with his plan after I had spoken to my surgeon. He refused to let me have the scan and sent me back to the ward where a delighful, patient registrar coaxed my veins to the surface, inserted a cannula and then sorted my scan out.Mt surgeon came to visit me and said I had been right to refuse as I ran significant risk of damage if the veins in that arm were traumatised. She said it would be different in life or death situations or if they needed to get a line in quickly and used ultrasound guidance but generally, avoid the veins in the arm where nodes have been removed.

I was already having tests for throat cancer when my breast cancer was diagnosed - although Thank God, it isn't cancer just another vocal chord problem. As a result of the investigations into these I had a chest x-ray which was abnormal so was referred to a chest physician who ruled out most things ( I was tested for AIDS, lung cancer, lymphoma all manner of wierd and wonderful diseases to no avail). I had repeated CT scans which continued to show problems and was eventually referred to Brompton just before Christmas for lung biopsy. It was suggested I had a condition that is almost invariably fatal within four or five years. I too baulked at putting family through more stress and decided to 'wait and see' outcome. When I had to tell them they were furious that I had deceived them and not told the entire truth. This was far more stressful than the potential diagnosis. Since then I decided to make sure my lungs were as fit as possible and started running/swimming etc. I had more tests just yesterday and they show a very significant improvement - which means I can't possibly have the progressive disease they talked about. We have booked a holiday in Africa for Easter and are almost at the point of opening champagne . If I still hadn't told them they would not be able to share my joy at seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. I think you have to trust them and talk! It made my life easier in so many ways. They have survived and even grown through the process. My relationship with my husband is even better as it has made us realise how much we mean to each other. I am delighted it is benign but really, genuinely sorry you have to go through this as well. I hope all turns out OK and the recovery is both swift and complete. Like you I am also wanting extensions - not sure how to go about it and how long hair has to be. I used cold cap so have a decent ( ish) covering of longer hair and a few thinner patches that need covering before I will wear my head in public.

The hotel was lovely, clean, comfortable beds, gallons of hot water for the baths and showers, three restaurants, a private beach etc. Staff and level of service was truly exceptional. they couldn't do enough and managed to charm everyone, playing sweetly with 11 year old girl, kicking ball around with 13 year old boy, bringing extra speacially cooked steaks and other food for 15 and 16 year old boys, gently flirting with 17 year old girl but not in a sleazy way and shaking hands with their father at frequent intervals.

He had booked us in for a night at the hotel as well but I told him to cancel as a) I'd worry about children being left alone in cottage and b) my boob is much too sore and blistered for any of that sort of thing just yet!........ I do really, really think you are going to have to talk to your husband and tell him. I'm not sure it's fair to hear it from a neurosurgeon in a hospital consulting room. I am sure he would want to know and want to support you. You are going to have to trust him - however hard that is at the moment......Not telling him isn't being kind or stopping him worrying. He needs to know. A bottle of wine and go for it. Take good care. Tess xx",

I am pleased you have told your husband - I am sure it will make it a little easier and he will feel pleased you are trusting him enough to share your fears. Lying to those we love isn't easy so that at least is one stress out of the way. He too will find the strength, I am sure and better he is devastated now and can face the neurosurgeon a bit better informed and hopefully calmer. I keep thinking about you as I am driving along and thinking what sh*t some of us have to go through - then reminding myself that we are the lucky ones we have good medical care, we have people who love and support us and we are strong enough to survive relatively intact. Maybe we'll even understand ourselves and others a bit better because of it. I'll certainly not take the good stuff quite so much for granted.

I am fed up as extensions didn't go as planned - I need a fringe to look like me and I lost hair along front hairline so nothing to attach extensions to apparently. I need to wait two months or so. I did see a website for a place in Mayfair that can do miraculous things with hardly any hair but we re talking £1000 approx and I am not sure even I can justify that for a couple of months extra hair.

I am off to have extensions done tomorrow to thicken it all out a bit and hopefully throw away the wig forever. New hair on thin patches is coming in rapidly - about an inch and a half long now.

My mother had tamoxifen for three years a while ago and then changed to an anastrazole inhibitor - she claims to have had no side effects whatsoever from it. I am not yet certain whether I will chose tamoxifen or zoladex and arimadex. I had a number of blood clots in my arm during chemo and tamoxifen increases risks of clotting in predisposed women so am awaiting blood results from my rheumatologist to see which is best option. I guess the side effects are only those we would get if we went through a natural menopause and are probably made worse by fretting. If we can get through chemo without too much trouble then I'm sure we can manage whilst our hormones are trashed. I'm investing in good moisturiser, a can of magicool, a pure silk nightdress and some makeup to cover any flushes. Tess",

On a plus side I was told my periods would stop and chemo would trigger a menopause a little early ( 48 years) but I finished chemo and started tamoxifen then talked about stoppping contraception - I had a hormone screen done and this clearly shows I am still fertile and not menopausal althuogh not having periods at the moment.

Of course, if one has advanced bone mets heavy pressure isn't a good idea but to spread the notion that 'pressure' can disperse or cause cancer to spread is just not borne out by fact. The bit about poorly clotting blood is also wrong - chemo drugs tend to cause problems with blood clotting too much - hence the risk of DVT's is much increased. As cancer patients we can do most things - we are not disabled, we are not about to spread the cancer by massage, we are going to be well again. Yes we need to reduce risk of infection for short periods during chemo (handwashing is best method of doing this), yes we may need to check out symptoms with an oncologist more frequently when on chemo but we can also enjoy most things safely.

My understanding of cancer cells is that they certainly can't be 'massaged' into activation and no harm whatsoever can come from being pummelled by someone using lotions and potions. I have been told all sorts of things that are not borne out by research or the experience of experts such as oncologists. Yes some lotions and potions would cause a problem with radio, yes your skin is more sensitive suring radio so rubbing isn't a good idea, no massaging does not trigger cancer ( or at least not according to any published research). Higher risks of activating rogue cells come from alcohol consumption, obesity, sunbathing and possibly using a mobile phone - most of us ignore this and then go into a blind panic about stuff that is unlikely to cause a problem or start spending a fortune on strange honey like LIfe Mel at £48 a jar.

How did you find salon? - I could make London but would prefer somewhere like Brighton or Southampton on south coast. Also when did eyelashes come back? I also hate my radio tattoo whish is bigger than I was led to expect and right at the top of my cleavage - looks like cattle branding to me. The one in axilla is fine, tiny, hardly noticeable.

      "Content": "Hello, The multi disciplinary team will use all your results and decide which treatment options are best in your given situation after they have the histology results from your surgery. If you have a lump removed then you will almost certainly be offered radiotherapy which does involve daily travel to a centre with linear accelerators, the machines they use for radio. I had seven weeks Mon to Friday but some places offer shorter courses. Chemo will depend on outcome of histology - but is still quite likely. You have a chemo day every three weeks and recovery time in between. I worked through chemo and so do plenty of others with a couple of days off each cycle. Your employer may help by allowing you to do some work from home, allowing part time hours or more gently duties - many are kindly disposed towards people on chemo. I found working an excellent distraction and actually felt better for doing something other than lying around being treated like a victim by well intentioned friends. Speak to your breast care nurse about transport to the hospital for radio and chemo - may are entitled to transport via volunteer drivers or ambulance service or at least have their costs paid. They can also help with money situations generally, as can Macmillan who can either give hardship grants or sound advice. I had three days off for the surgery then worked from home for a couple of days as I still had drains in under my arm - otherwise felt fine. Good luck with surgery. Tess x",

      "Content": "Hi Crowsnest (interesting name!) I'm not as far down the road as you are so can't comment on giving up arimadex early. I did stop radiotherapy a little early. I was getting warning signs for lymphoedema and didn't want a lifetime of disability if the further treatments wouldn't make a huge difference. I was put under quite a lot of pressure from radiographers to continue but refused further treatment until i'd spoken to consultant. he was fine about it, weighed up pro's and con's and discussed difference it would make to outcome ( not very much apparently as they always err on side of caution). He arranged extra booster doses to tumour bed adn we stopped full radio from then on. People told me I was mad and to take everything to prevent recurrence but I think that was mainly a knee jerk reaction. I assume my oncologist was being entirely truthful and had the data in front of him so went with stopping. It wasn't an easy decision but I'm glad I made it. Quality of life is so important and if an horrendous treatment isn't going to make a significant impact why have it? I would suggest a discussion with your oncologist to determin whether it really does matter or not. Tess",

I am definitely using cold cap again. It was OK. I was slightly appalled that oncology registrar admitted they actively discouraged people as it is very time consuming and additional work for staff. She admitted telling patients it didn't work with FEC but knowing research suggested otherwise. Her rationale was that she was trying to save lives not hair and that hairloss didn't really matter as it grew back. She was young and I wonder how she would feel if she was in same boat... Tess x",

If you ask your surgeon or oncologist they can actually use a predictive tool to show exactly what the risk of recurrence and death from cancer in your specific circumstances are.

I had read research about a team of international dragonboating ex-breast cacner patients and how the hard physical exercise had resulted in none of the team of around thirty getting lymphodoema, so ignored most advice to 'take it easy' and pushed a bit harder. My surgeon was the only one who said recent research suggests that moderate repetitive exercise to upper body does help with healing wounds, fatigue and reducing complications.

She said draining would increase risk of infection (which makes sense). I was driving seven days post op and at gym within ten days. I have full mobility in that arm and all is healing very well. breast scar now a thin slightly pink line and axillary scar more red and larger but well healed and gradually fading. I decided to do as much as possible as soon as possible as I think it reduces risk of complications and more movement will improve lymph drainage. My clinical oncologist is going to do radiotherapy to the mid line of clavicle nodes rather than treat the axillary node bed directly to reduce risk of lymphodoema. It is, apparently just as effective but with less complications. Hope your problems resolve sooner rather than later. Tess",

      "Content": "I used cold cap throughout and am delighted I did. It is five months since I finished chemo and my hair is nearly back to normal - shoulder length and thick. It wasn't pleasant. I got disheartened during cycle three when some started falling out and hair thinned in patched meaning I had to get the wig out. It took longer each time I went for chemo ( although most people seemed to take ages anyway). It stopped feeling so awful about ten minutes after it is put on as your head just goes numb. It does let you retain some control. It does work for most people who persevere. Ignore stuff about special organic shampoos - just a way of parting you from your money and certainly no evidence it works. Ignore people who say cold cap doesn't work for FEC - research proves it does. Don't expect a complete miracle, some loss will occur but not the devastating total hairloss I was not prepared to deal with. Chemo isn't as bad as you imagine it is going to be and is over fairly quickly. As for portacath - I used plain old fashioned cannulation and my veins are rubbish. I had DVT's so it always took seven or eight attempts as a minimum but I am now glad I resisted PICC's and portacaths as I hated anything that made me look or feel more like a cancer 'victim'. I have two wigs an NHS one that is an expensive monofilament and which was completely free but was a tad too dark for my natural hair colour so I don't wear it at all. I also bought one from Trendco in Brighton which was a perfect match for the colour and style of my own hair so no-one noticed the transition. Tess x",

I had my hair cut shorter about 8 weeks post chemo, as advised by my lovely hairdresser. It made it looked thicker and got rid of the straggly patchy look. It was shoulder length until then but she took a few inches off and then highlighted it for me so it looked like a postive choice to go different. Most colleagues did not know I was on chemo and I still got loads of compliments on my shorter (but nowhere near crew cut/ ultra short) hair. I was planning extensions at around three/four months but decided I liked my hair as it was and was happy to go without them. If you think about it, hair itself is dead already and just hangs there. it can be dried out and made more brittle by heat etc but chemicals inside us only affect the hair follicle not the hair. At end of chemo we need to be careful of pulling on hair roots to avoid further damage to fragile follicles but all this organic shampoo and expensive 'natural' stuff is just hogwash and placebo. I used head and shoulders throughout as it reduced itching and the zinc in it is proven to stimulate hair growth ( by research rather than old wives tales). It is such a nice feeling knowing that cold cap will be your last and that it is worth it. It is SO nice when you fell like your hair makes you look like you again. Enjoy! Tess x",

The Paxman cold cap does often work quite well even with FEC - about 70% of women who persevere with it report success. Unfortunately, if you don't use it from the beginning, I suspect the hair follicles are already damaged and it is too late to prevent further loss. I had trouble with nurses trying to stuff gauze or cotton wool under the edges to stop it making my head too cold!!! I even had one trying to put a gauze layer inside the cold cap to make it a little warmer. It might be worth trying again if you move on to Taxotere as this is less tosic and my hair started regrowing then and was back to usual much quicker than if I hadn't used it. The wigs are Ok ish but you never really get used to them just something that has to be done, I guess. Tess x",

This is basically a system that takes all your specific circumstances into consideration and tells you your 5 year survival rate and 10 year recurrence rate and will give the rates with each of the treatments added in so you can see how much difference they make. I found mine very reassuring adn it made me realise that most of us recover from breast cancer with the amazing treatments available nowadays. I wonder if you have read the 5 year survival rate as 'we are only going to survive 5 years'. This is a common misconception. In fact it means that they only measure survival at five years because after this time, if there is no recurrence you are considered cured. It is a bit scary being diagnosed, the treatments though effective are hardly pleasant but we do get through it and come out the other side. Make sure you ask for hard data about your specific circumstances before going into blind panic. Tess x",

Tell them there was a bad bit growing inside and that this sometimes happens to ladies but that the surgeons have done the operation to make it better.

An overactive thyroid is more concerning as it can lead to cardiac problems if unresolved. Your chemo will, I am sure be every three weeks - the gold standard for treatment of breast cancer.

I used cold cap throughout and am delighted I did. i never wanted to do the cancer victim look ( sounds harsh, I know) I wanted to keep being me and not to be treated with sympathy etc at work. I was told it wouldn't work was awful etc etc. I did more research and discovered that despite teh oncologist saying I would definitely lose all my hair this was not necessarily so. the cold cap wokrs quite well for about 75% of women that persevere. It isn't a good look whilst in use and is a bit chilly but take a paracetemol beforehand, a flask of hot drink and a blanket to keep warm and it is fine. I kept most of my hair and it started growing back after cycle three when epirubicin ( in FEC) finished and Taxotere started. i thinned a bit and got a few bald patches so wore a wig cut to exactly my style and colour to cover these but the real benefit was that it grew back very very shortly after chemo and I could be normal again much quicker. I never had the really short crew cut look ( best left to beautiful, elfin faced younger women). People tell me they don't mind going bald or that you get used to it, that it is empowering but it was never for me. I wanted to stay looking like me. Good luck with treatment. tess x",

It hopefully prevents recurrence and if you should ever be unlucky enough to get spread it then contains it for a good while. The more receptor positive your tumour the better the results from tamoxifen and arimadex. I had wide local excision and axillary clearance in June, have just finished chemo and started radio today. In truth, I can say none of it has been anywhere near as bad as I imagined it would be. Hope all goes well. Tess",

The outcomes for lumpectomy and mastectomy in terms of survival are exactly the same. I would say you need more professional information so you can make an informed choice rather than rely on other peoples anxieties to drive you towards mastectomy. Ask your surgeon for a print out of adjuvent online the predicitive tool that shows the risks for you personally with various treatment options. It can tel you what difference chemotherapy makes, for instance and weigh up the difference (or probably no difference) between mastectomy and lumpectomy. If you have no nodal spread you are in a very good position and odds or recurrence or not surviving are quite low assuming it is not a triple negative tumour. Do not be frightened into a mastectomy. I was so pleased muy surgeon threw my husband out ot the consultation when he kept on about 'getting rid of it all' and put heavy pressure on for a mastectomy. My surgeon was adamant I would do much better with lumpectomy and axillary node clearance. It reduces risk of lymphoedema and other complications such as serious infections and it is really very minor surgery so you are in a much better place to start any other treatment. Tess x",

My surgeon was really good and luckily I was more or less back to normal a couple of days later - albeit with a tennis ball sized seroma that resolved witout intervention and didn't cause any problems. On the follow up my surgeon gave me the histology report and also turned her computer around to show me in detail the statistics for me personally on her prognostic indicator database. These includedd five and ten year survival rates, recurrence rates and the difference various treatements made - she put in about three different chemo regimes to come up with the best option for me. As a combined course or chemp/radio/hormonal therapies increases five year survival by about 29% I'd be mad not to accept the offer. The way I look at it is that I should be extremely grateful I have ready, free, access to some of the best healthcare in the world. In most countries I would not be offered these potent drugs or would be denied them if I couldn't afford to pay. As it is, I get what is best for me regardless of cost, at a centre quite close to my home. I even get money towards a wig and a special clinic to help me chose one. It seems churlish to complain about side effects given the drugs will hopefully mean I can watch not only my children but my grandchildren graduate. I think everyone should be shown their specific statistics on the predictive prognostic tool as it certainly made the decision into a non-event in my case. Tess x",

He doesn't like to wake me or disturb me as he thinks I need to sleep to get better??? I have to say it has passed me by completely but I agreed to see if there was anything I could do to remedy situation apart from separate beds - which aren't nearly so much fun....several people (including GP friend) mentioned a herbal thing called Black Cohosh - taken for best effect with St Johns Wort - a popular and proven 'remedy' for menopausal symptoms. I though excellent -sorted - etc etc but pharmacist was very switched on and took me to one side and asked if I had ever had an oestrogen dependent tumour as black cohosh should never be taken if you have. So warning do not take this stuff without checking with oncologist if you are uncertain as to ER status of your tumours. As happens, I researched a bit when I came home and pharmacist was correct.......I guess he'll have to cope for a bit longer or buy warmer PJ's. Tess x",

If need be insist on a referral to a fertility specialist. Ask again why zoladex is unsuitable - it is usually prescribed for women who want ot preserve their fertility and who have oestrogen receptor positive tumours ( which yours is if you are going to have tamoxifen). Zoladex is used to temporarily dampen the ovaries whilst having active treatment and is reversible. Surgical removal or irradiation are not reveresible. Ask for a second opinion if necessary. Sounds like they think saving your life is the important bit ( which it is) and are paying less consideration to the holistic treatment of you as a person. Kick up quickly and loudly until either measures are put in place to preserve your fertility or they properly explain why this is not possible.

I thought everyone more or less got FEC and Tax now - I'd be tempted to ask oncologist why you weren't having Taxotere as the last three cycles. Yes I lost all body hair - everywhere - meant I didn't have to wax or shave legs for ages and had to invest in eyeliner to disguise loss of eyelashes (works quite well and stops the 'cancer patient look' I so detest). I started wearing more lippy too to change focus of face and disguise sallow skin. Body hair came out about cycle three, I think, but was thinning before then. I got a bit uncomfortable in some areas where all hair was lost so invested in some granny knickers to stop skin on skin rub. Husband quite pleased with regrowth - all lovely and soft - I shall say no more on that subject though! Eyelashes nearly back to normal now and I can wear mascara to boost them a bit ( had to re-learn skill from my teenage daughter).

      "Content": "That isn't quite right - Zoladex (like Tamoxifen and anything else that reduces oestrogen like surgical oophrectomy and irradiation of ovaries) would reduce effectiveness of chemo if given at the same time. This is because the chemo attacks rapidly dividing cells like cancer and ovaries and lining of mouth. If oestrogen is reduced it reduces ability of chemo to attack cancer so higher levels are maintained during chemo and then sledgehammered after chemo with Tamoxifen/zoladex/irraditation and surgery. Zoladex should be used after chemo to suppress oestrogen in women who wish to maintain fertility - although it won't help with the effects chemo may have on your ability to conceive at a later date. It is often given to women who can't tolerate Tamoxifen for some reason and need to use arimadex or similar. I think it would still be worth speaking to a fertility specialist ASAP as there are so many things that can be done to boost chances of conception in women with reduced fertility. I think you should make sure you are doing all ou can to protect yourself. On a personal note - I kept having periods all through chemo and only stopped once on the Tamoxifen, so may not be quite as dire as you are now thinking as long as you don't have any permanent method or suppressing ovarian function.
