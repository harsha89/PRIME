I developed small hard masses at the point of my scar, which was just a part of the healing process. As part of my bathing routine I use skin moisturiser - just the aqua from the pharmacist is good, and I just made sure that the scar tissue was kept moisturised and supple! I'm now on the FEC stage and has treated myself to some lovely body butter from the bodyshop (other shops exist!), and so far have not suffered dry skin. Keep smiling.",

Something inside so strong by Labi Siffre The higher you build your barriers The taller I become The farther you take my rights away The faster I will run You can deny me You can decide to turn your face away No matter, cos there's.... Something inside so strong I know that I can make it Tho' you're doing me wrong, so wrong You thought that my pride was gone Oh no, something inside so strong Oh oh oh oh oh something inside so strong The more you refuse to hear my voice The louder I will sing You hide behind walls of Jericho Your lies will come tumbling Deny my place in time You squander wealth that's mine My light will shine so brightly It will blind you Cos there's......

      "Content": "Hi there! I would like to tell of my friends who wear the mammogram survivor t-shirt! Friend A had routine mammogram, found a lump, had it removed and chemo and is now 10 years into good health etc: Friend B found a lump went for a mammogram and the lump was benign, however her other breast was riddled with little tumours, she had mx and chemo and is now 8 years on and fighting fit; Friend C went for routine scan, found a lump and had it removed and has just finished tamoxifen; Friend D went for routine scan, found a lump and had it removed, back for a check up 2 years later, other side had a lump and had that removed and is now 6 years on and fighting fit; Friend E had exactly the same as friend D; and finally Friend F who had a mammogram as part of a good health at work initiative, she was in her early 40s - found a lump had it removed and chemo etc and is doing well on tamoxifen. Yes sadly I have freinds who died of this, but they were both in their 30s and both very ill when their cancer was found. So forgive me if I do not support the idea of reducing scanning or refusing scanning because of the potential problems of treatment. Very selfishly I really enjoy my friends' company and but for routine scanning I might not have any one of four of them now to support me on my journey. Thank you to my friends and thankyou to the radiographers and all the other highly dedicated and devoted health professionals.",

In the meantime i find that my travel bands (worn to combat nausea) are also useful against anxiety. My 2nd FEC is next week and i am wearing my bands as a fashoion statement! I would recommend that you try a pair - avaiable from most pharmacies including Boots!",
