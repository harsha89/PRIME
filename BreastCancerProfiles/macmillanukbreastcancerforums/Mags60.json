      "Content": "Morning Mrs Shep, I can totally relate to what you are going through .... the panic experience is awful.... but it sort of passes as you get into the treatment.... it is terrifying but it does get easier. I found deep breathing helped a lot, but I also took a low dose Citalipram and this really helped. In fact I continued taking it throughout my treatment and weaned off only recently. It might sound crazy but the panic attacks for me were worse than anything I had to face afterwards. I hope this helps and I hope you will feel more positive when you get your results. Come back on here if you feel panicky or speak to your Macmillan Nurse once you are allocated one. I used to find that if I laid down the panic attack felt worse..... so I used a few more pillows or I would go sit in my recliner chair and read for a while. I was also scared to lay down in case I died. My family bought me a kindle with a light so I did not disturb my husband. It's early days for you but you will develop coping strategies. As Andraemily has already said you will feel more positive once you have seen your oncologist. Once you have a treatment plan you will be more in control.... I think sometimes panic attacks are about loss of control. Good luck and let us know how you are doing if you are up to it. Magsx",

      "Content": "Hi, I agree about Physio... ask to be referred to Physio who specialises post reconstruction. Cording is so painful and I found I just couldn't stretch quite enough to make a difference. I also had massage therapy.  My plastic surgeon referred me to a Physio who worked in the cancer unit at the hospital where I had surgery.... she definitely helped me.  X",
