My drain was removed the morning after surgery and it should not have been.  The seventh time of asperating finally it has gone never to return. The BCN's did six of them over 200mls each time last one done by prof brown when I was due a scan got 365 MLS no scan done but fluid all gone. Might be worth you asking to be asperated as it should not be swishing around  Raegan",

Now it is exactly the same as yours I saw my BCN last week about it and advice was to massage for about two months. She said it is like a honeycomb, and the liquid has congeald. My skin is red with massaging as it is pretty big,not my breast haha the seroma, but I will do as they ask for six weeks if it ain't going down two weeks will not make any difference. Everyone is different though yours may just sort itself out. Don't worry too much if it was anything they would give you a Scan ",

Then told get chemo then in tablets for five years. Then chemo taken away felt like all the rugs been pulled from under me. Now on letrezole and risedronate, but have swelling above my wound BCN thinks it is fluid thT has congealed even although I had my wound aspirated five times, so have to massage as much as I can. Have done this and nothing has changed still there, now need to go for a scan, plus had a wee lump u see right arm she said get antibiotics which I have done still there that also needs looked at now. I do not have any appointments to see oncologist nor any dr till my first mammagram after op which is not till December, can I ask if I can have mammagram before this or would it be best to pay privately for one as I cannot wait till Dec now that chemo not offered I have the chance of it coming back elsewhere. I know I should not think like this but any thing different with my breast or wound is driving me mad with these thoughts. Any help would be appreciated ",

What a huge disappointment not one call nothing no sympathy nothing. I have now had 8 aspiration to my would with between 180 mls to 365 Mls each time.  Also have lymphodema which surgeon knew nothing about or so he said, yet it is as a result of him damaging my nodes during the operation. My brother passed away in jan 2016 he said Macmillan did absolutely nothing for him, no help about finances, treatment in fact no nursss came near him. He was 62 so young nowadays I said I cannot believe that they would treT a patient like this how wrong I was I am being treated exactly the same, not the same area his was Edinburgh mine is dundee so cannot day it is same area. Even after saying nodes damaged by surgeon not a dickie bird you would think that would make it more important, as surgeon afraid I would sue as now have lymphodema for life as chronic. I would never sue over this accidents do happen but you would think this would make a difference to them keeping in touch not at all do different from what you see on tv and in leaflets . Let\u2019s hope they are not all like this ",
