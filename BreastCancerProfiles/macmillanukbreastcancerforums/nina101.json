      "Content": "HI pgtips,   I had MX and a diep flap reconstruction about two and a half weeks ago. The op was long - approx 10 hours but as a medic friend of mine told me, the length of the op is not of as much consequence as we attach to it - the risk of going into and coming out of the GA is the main risk, not so much the length of the op. Don't know about you, but as I have a large cup size (DD) and because I didn't want silicone implants, my surgeon said that LD was not an option for me and suggested the DIEP. He had concerns about finding enough fat even from the DIEP to get adequate volume for my cup size  but was reasonably confident that it would be okay ( I did not have too much flab on my tummy ) , so the advantage of a tummy tuck was not a real consideration. However, I was told that one does get good results from the DIEP, so I went with it. I did have a couple of consultations just to fully understand the risks associated with it, which I would advise. It is important that you understand the risks and the benefits fully. In terms of recovery, I was told it is a 2 to 6 week period with a 'fullish' recovery taking about 3 months. The first few days were difficult and quite uncomfortable, surprising with the back taking the brunt as one has to walk in a hunched up position to allow for the op on the abdomen. This eased as soon as the drains came out ( 4 days post op). 2 weeks after the op, I was able to walk into the consultant's office for my consultation and today ( 2 and a half weeks later ) I went for another consultation where I even managed to go out for lunch after the consultation. The discomfort is very bearable, I am not on any painkillers but do need to rest and not over exert myself. As to the results of the recon, I have no reason to be displeased at the moment and will not judge it until a further 2 - 3 months, which is when I believe the body will really start to settle down into its new shape/ form. Hope this helps but don't hesitate if you have any other questions. Good luck with your decision making. Lots of love   NIna",

      "Content": "Hi Jane, Sorry you find yourself on this journey. I have my Mx scheduled in a fortnight's time and I can feel the anxiety starting to build up; so I can't imagine how it must feel the week- end before the op day. Perhaps, it might help to think of it  in terms of  being the first step towards conquering the disease ? The BCN did tell me repeatedly that as far as surgical procedures go, the Mx is not a complicated one, as no internal organs are involved, so it should go smoothly.  Psychologically, we are all here to support you as best as we can. Good luck and a big hug.  Xx",

      "Content": "Hi Maria, Is tomorrow your first appointment with the Plastic Surgeon ? If so, he will probably suggest the type of reconstructions that may be suitable for you. His/ her recommendations will take into account your breast size, your attitude to implants, body fat available on you, the state of your abdomen, in terms of whether you have had any previous abdominal surgeries or not , etc. One of the key things for you to consider is whether you would like a reconstruction using an implant or one that uses a donor site from your own body. Your bust size will have a bearing on this decision. I'm not quite sure what the exact scope of your appointment tomorrow is, but I definitely took at least two appointments before i decided on which type of reconstruction to go for, using the first one just to understand the risks associated with the various types of reconstructions  and the second one to assess how good an outcome was realistically achievable, especially as I was keen to avoid surgery to my healthy breast.  In my experience and from what I have heard from a couple of friends who have been through this, surgeons will almost always say that some corrective surgery is required, following the first operation for reconstruction. I had a right mastectomy followed by an immediate reconstruction using the DIEP flap almost three months ago. The surgeon has achieved fairly good results. The reconstructed breast is slightly larger than the original one, but my surgeon tells me that to reduce it is not complicated and can be done fairly easily. All in all, I am not displeased with the reconstructed breast and am grateful that I was able to have an  immediate reconstruction , especially when I think of the emotional and psychological struggle that so many have to face, when not offered an immediate reconstruction. The thing with the DIEP flap is that while some like the tummy tuck aspect of it, the long scar right across your lower abdomen is hard to ignore, when you look in the mirror every morning. Also, it does give you a fair bit of discomfort in the early days, it can alter the shape down from your waist to your hip, along with having a bit of an impact on your belly button. All this of course is largely seen just by me. Most of my friends envy my new trim clothed body and my almost flat belly. So, that's my silver lining in the dark cloud of cancer. Hope this helps and I am sure you will  hear from some of the others with their experiences. Hope it goes well for you tomorrow. NIna",

      "Content": "Hi nelly bean, You may already know this but thought I would mention it anyway as it is an important distinction... Mistymoley has alerted others to this previously too.... There is a key difference between the TRAM flap and the DIEP flap. The TRAM flap uses the muscle from your abdomen whereas the DIEP flap uses the fat and the tissue from your abdomen and involves some microsurgery in terms of the moving of some  very small blood supply vessels. The long term impacts from the two surgeries are different and you need to fully understand these when making your choice. The impression that I got from my surgeon was that these days the DIEP flap is preferred over the TRAM but you may wish to get your surgeon's view on this. The one that you mention about using the muscle from the back is the LD. Do consider the surgeon's skills in performing a particular kind of operation and consider different hospitals if you don't get your choice where you are. Good luck in your journey. Nina",

      "Content": "hi clh,   Did you need to have any radiotherapy or chemo after your recon ? I am being offered an immediate DIEP recon - and being told that even if I were to need radiotherapy, the reconstruction does not affect my treatment, as radiotherapy can still be undertaken effectively - and that it will only affect  the aesthetic outcome of the reconstruction. Anyone out there been affected by impact of radiotherapy on an autologous reconstruction ? Thanks",

      "Content": "Hi Rosie,   I am due to have a mx at the end of the month and have been advised an immediate reconstruction - DIEP flap. I understand that the hospital stay is about 4 nights and 5 days, the first 2 in ICU/ high dependency unit.Following this, as far as I know, the recovery period seems to be subjective- with it varying from 2 to 6 weeks. According to my surgeon, he seems to notice a considerable improvement on the 16th day when compared to the 14th day, so it would appear that the first fortnight is rough ! I haven't been through it yet, so it would be really useful to hear from ladies who have been through it. Has anyone out there had a DIEP flap and been concerned about not having enough volume in the tummy to reconstruct the breast ? How satisfactory have the reconstructions been, in terms of the aesthetic outcome, particularly in terms of symmetry. All comments welcome. Thanks",

      "Content": "Hi Annie, I am not on chemo as having the surgery first, so don't know if it is wise to take any of this stuff when you are on chemo drugs, so please check with someone who might know, but i will tell you what i am taking. I am taking echinacea drops that i bought from Holland and Barrett. I got these as soon as I knew about the impending surgery, I understand that they are most effective if you take them for 10 days, give a few days break and then start again. they are most effective in the liquid form, Also H&B have a buy one get one free going on at the moment. The lady at Holland and Barrett also advised Manuka honey. I was having this and then read in one of the books that sugar, including high doses of fructose and honey, is really harmful for cancer, so stopped. It is so difficult to balance the differing advice on nutrition.  I have rationalised my fruit intake ( used to have loads as i love fruit ) and increased my veggie intake. As far as   I know, there is also a link between vitamin D deficiency and cancer. I needed to have a full blood count last week and surprise surprise, I am vitamin D deficient, so the gp gave me some vitamins. Oranges, kiwi and vitamin C in any form will help immunity but this can't be easy to ingest, given the state of your mouth. Do you think you may be able to manage some freshly squeezed lemon juice in luke warm water ? ( Mind you - luke warm, not boiled or very hot, as it kills the vitamin C ) Hope this helps. Xxxxx PS  I am also eating lots of leafy vegetables - cabbage, spinach, broccoli and cauliflower - supposed to be very good for cancer, along with blueberries - and if you can get organic food, all the better.",

      "Content": "Dear Annabel, I used to do yoga a couple of years ago and found it very relaxing. Since my diagnosis, my husband has been asking me to re-start it. However, i have been reluctant as my surgery is in a fortnight's time and i felt that i did not want to start it now, if i would not be able to continue it for a while after my op. Also, have a lot of things to organise and finish off before the op, so time is a bit scarce. However, a friend of mine who does yoga and meditation regularly, offered to come and just do some breathing exercises and meditation with me one evening, just before my bedtime, after all the chores for the day were done and i felt i could spend some time for myself. I found this to be extremely useful and relaxing. The meditation involved visualisation - visualising myself being healed.  I can provide you with more info on how i do it, if you are interested. Apparently, the breathing exercises can also be helpful, as they increase your intake of oxygen and can help fight the dreaded enemy. May be worth finding a good yoga class or teacher in your area. There are plenty where i am and some of them even come home and do one to one sessions; and it doesn't have to cost a fortune.  I am trying to keep it up myself, though it is not as affective as when my friend talked me through it - but even 15 - 20 mins of breathing exercises and mediation before bedtime, is sending me to bed in a calmer state and is helping. I have also cleaned up my diet and am trying to take a'holistic' approach to this beast. Hang in there. Lots of love and hugs xxxx",

      "Content": "Hi Carol,   I have been meaning to respond to your message for the last couple of days but just could not get round to it as I have been extremely busy trying to resolve the various issues that I need to resolve before I go for my surgery next week. Like you, I am also having a mastectomy and DIEP flap reconstruction on my right breast next week. They have not done my SLN yet as my consultant did not think that it was conclusive in itself with regard establishing the invasiveness of the cancer. Don't quite know what treatment plan awaits me,  While i am not able to provide the information that you seek, based on experience, I can share what my consultants have told me. Expect the first 2 weeks to be very rough, with the first two days being particularly painful -  I think they give us plenty of drugs to ease the pain, though ! According to one of my consultants, we should set aside 3 months for a full recovery. According to the plastic surgeon undertaking the DIEP flap, it can be less than that, 4 - 6 weeks, it being subjective and all that. I am meeting my plastic surgeon again this friday and can try and ask him specific questions, so please feel free to  share any that you have with me. I did ask about driving  but can't remember what they said - it won't be any earlier than it is for a caesarean section, though ! Keep focusing on the benefit of the reconstruction rather than the magnitude/ complexity of the surgery. Thats how I am dealing with the anxiety about the forthcoming op. As they say, I am trying to keep calm and carry on. Working hard - to divert myself ! Best wishes Nina Xx",

      "Content": "Hi Carol, Welcome back home after the op ! I came home on Tuesday, too. Similar stories - approx ten hour operation - struggled with the drains for the first 3 -4 days but the pain was quite bearable. It is ironical  isn't  it- that they operate on our front for 10 hours and it is the back pain that we complain about. Had a laugh with my plastic surgeon about that ! I am finding that while I can sit most comfortably, finding a comfortable lying position is difficult and supporting the body weight when walking places a tremendous strain on the lower back. Can't seem to manage anything other than very short walks to the bathroom or kitchen/ dining table etc. My recon is swollen so can't quite tell what the end result will be but have a lot of faith in my surgeon, so hopefully it will be good. The dressings come off next Friday - Yippeee  ! Happy to be at the other end of the surgery ! Lots of love Nina x",
