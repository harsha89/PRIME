      "Content": "Hi all I am due to start taxotere on Thursday.  I've had three A/C treatments so far.  I'm interested to hear how people have found taxotere - are the side effects better/worse/different to the AC?   I found the AC side effects followed the same pattern every time for me - a day or two of feelng OK, then a week or so of feeling awful (queasy, even with the expensive meds, weepy, sore all over, icky taste in mouth, very fatigued... ) then gradual improvement with the last week really feeling completely normal.  I've been able to continue running - more slowly, but managed 11km yesterday.   Have people found the taxotere to be quite predictable every treatment cycle?

I am on day 6 of taxotere today (had my treatment on Thursday.)  Felt absolutely fine on Friday and Saturday (ran 8 km on Friday, did parkrun on Saturday); started to feel achy on Sunday and was in a lot of pain and misery yesterday.  Maybe feeling slightly better this morning but still pretty grotty - it is weird how I hurt basically all over!  Paracetamol doesn't seem to touch it so I took cocodamel last nigh which definitely seemed to help. I think felt worse than I would usually have done yesterday because I couldn't just give in to the tiredness and pain as we had a house guest (bad planning but couldn't be helped...) . The icky mouth is pretty gross I have to say!  Tea tastes of sour milk :(   Ann",

The only ones I tried were baked beans and mashed potatoes, both of which I love, but they did taste gross so I didn't go there again.  Couldn't agree with this more!!!  Several foods are dead to me forever because I ate them in my sickest phase.  I would also add, don't use perfumes  / shower gels etc that are scented when you are feeling nauseous as you may dislike the scent afterwards.  Bodyshop British Rose showergel makes me feel nauseous now when I smell it!

      "Content": "Hi volvox167  I am so sorry you are going through all the stress of breast cancer, plus worrying about how it may affect your fitness and your life in future.  All the more so since you must be a pretty impressive rower to be training for a national competition!! When I was diagnosed in March this year, I was training for the Paris marathon.  I ran it the week before my surgery - which was good because it gave me something nice to think about when I went under with the anaesthetic.  LIke you, I worried - still do worry - about getting my fitness back.  I ran through chemo (which I finished at the end of September) and I'm running through radiotherapy (which I will finish next week.)  It has been hard and being slower than I used to be has been upsetting, even though I know it's obviously to be expected.  But I am have kept going and as I move further out from the chemo I can feel myself getting stronger.  My other hobby is rock climbing; that is where most of my anxiety about regaining my fitness is, because (as with rowing) it relies a lot on arm/chest/back muscles, and I can still feel the effects of the lymph node clearance 6 months later...  BUT - although I am anxious about it in my heart of hearts I do believe I will eventually get back to my old self, fitness wise.  And so will you. When is your surgery?  Best of luck, will be thinking of you - Ann xx",

      "Content": "Hi sunriser52  I can really relate to your worries; I too am very scared that my cancer will recur.  (I was diagnosed in March, had lumpectomy (*2) and chemo, and will finish radiotherapy on Monday).   I think the reason why MRIs aren't standard is that, firstly, we have been treated for cancer so we should have a good chance of being cancer free at the end of it.  And secondly, they would produce a lot of false positives, which are very worrying to deal with.  I had a chest x ray and CT scan at the start of my treatment because I had some shoulder/back pain.  The CT scan showed two areas in my ribs which the radiologist thought might be from metastases; my oncologist thought probably not - so I had to wait six months and have a repeat scan.  During those six months I was constantly trying to worry about the second scan; and my anxiety after scan 2 while waiting for the results was almost unbearable.  Luckily for me, the radiologist thought the second scan was consistent with healing fractures rather than cancer - it does make sense because I had whooping cough last year and hurt my ribs due to the extreme coughing.  So my point is, I had a lot of anxiety caused by a false positive - an MRI wouldn't necessarily put your mind at rest, as you might have to wait for follow up scans if they see \"iffy\" areas anywhere - it wouldn't necessarily be a cut and dried answer. So I can totally understand your anxiety - I am suffering from it too, particularly as my mum had breast cancer which recurred 6 years after treatment and was not curable at that stage  - but I just am not sure that an MRI scan would really help lay it to rest...

There was a month during which we seemed to be endlessly waiting - for biopsy results, for meetings with the surgeon, for a treatment plan, for a surgery date - and for some reason I didn't want to make it properly public till all that was nailed down.  I did start to feel awkward about it though, as my life on facebook seemed exactly as it usually is - eg I ran the Paris marathon the week before the  surgery - but at the same time, my life wasn't normal at all anymore. It started to feel dishonest to keep it secret any longer.  So after much angst about how much to say and how to say it -  which really stressed me, I wanted to get it out there but also didn't want to, as it made it all seem to real- eventually my husband put it on facebook for me at Easter. This what he said -\"Four weeks ago Annalise as diagnosed with breast cancer. On Tuesday she will have surgery followed by further therapy. We have managed to squeeze in some really good times ahead of this but she is so strong, fit and loved that we are sure she will be running, climbing and back at work soon.\" As for it being TMI, I decided that facebook was a good way for me to connect with those of my friends and family who are far away,  and that I should feel free to share as much or as little as I wanted to.  I did unfriend some people at that point in time because I realised that I didn't really \"know\" them anymore - eg people from the distant past or vague acquaintances who I had no real connection with.
