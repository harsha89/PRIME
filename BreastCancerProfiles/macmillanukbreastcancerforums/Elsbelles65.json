      "Content": "Hi there, I had a mastectomy with DIEP flap (using stomach tissue, skin, muscle etc), on May 4th and whilst the op went well I'm not v happy with the way it looks. It is much smaller than the other one and very flat like a plate. I know that further work can be done can anyone tell me how long it was before they had lipomodelling nipple reconstruction and tattoo. Thanks Eli x",

      "Content": "Hi there, thanks it makes it less worrying to know it's normal. I'm having to wear a sports bra for 6 weeks so that squashes them quite flat too. I've been told to gently massage with oil or cream and that seems to be breaking down the hard lumps of fat and that is making it softer but I'm really unhappy with the way it looks.Â  Good luck with your recovery xx",
