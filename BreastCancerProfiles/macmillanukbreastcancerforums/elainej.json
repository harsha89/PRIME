On the postive side I rang the hairdressers and spoke to the manager - she is very kindly going to allow me to use the offer when my hair grows",

The drainage wasn't painful but I feel very swollen under my arm and this is making it difficult to do my exercises, which I am doing , I know I will probably need the seroma draining again but it 's not a big thing just uncomfortable Hugs to all xxxx",

I have to have a full mastectomy and axilla clearance as they found cells in 1 of my lymph nodes and i can't have a reconstruction till after i finish my treatments which will include cheom and hormone treatment and might include radiotherapy and herceptin , but i'm focusing on one thing at a time and reminding myself that everything that they do to me or give me id helping me fight this awful disease,and that i'm getting a free boob job at the end of it . i wil report back as soon as i can  so remember as David Cameron !! said ' we are all in this together '   keep  strong and take care xx Elaine",

I do have a daughter, sister, friends and an ex husband (on wife) who are supportive in their own way but 99% of the time i'm alone . I have been divorced for 15 years and I'm used to being alone but i some times think it would be lovely just to have some one to hold on to in the dark , but  know how aweful it is to have some one there who is the support you need ,when my father died of undiagnosised lung cancer my husband (as he was then ) was less than the tower of strengh that i needed. i don't know which is better to have a unsupportive partner or to have no partner at all , cos at least i don't have to fight any one for the remote control , but as every one says WE are here for you and we will always support you with love xxx",

I live alone , have a grown-up daughter who lives 5 mins away with her partner, a ex-husband and his wife( who I get on very well with ,if fact she comes to some appointments with me and I like the look on the Docs face when I tell then she is married to my ex), a sister who unfortunately can't help at present cos she had a MX on wednesday( she was diagnosised 3 weeks after me ) and a group of good friends, I only say hello to my neighbours in passing. My questions is all my friends say 'if you need anything just ring me' but should I have to , I am wrong it just wanting some one to call round and offer to do something or to take me out , at present even though it 8 weeks since my MX and axillary clearence, I'm still not driving due to a seroma that was drained 8 times , a heamatoma and cording !! , I am doing everything for my self and I'm aware that all my friends have busy lives of their own but it would be nice for just one of them to offer some help, they do help when I ring if they can but one good friend has offered to call to see me 4 times then has back out at the last minutes with family issues sorry for the moan I'm off to try and teach the cats to empty their own litter trays xxxxx",

      "Content": "Hi Dawn I can understand your thinking but having a bilateral mastectomy if you can get your surgeon to agree is no guarantee that you won't have to have further treatment , the radiotherapy is done to make sure that any microscopic cancer cells that may have escaped are zapped and the hormone treatment such as Tamoxifen or Lentrazole are given to reduce or eliminate the chance of recurrence. The treatments aren't pleasant but all are doable . I had a full mastectomy , chemo,radio, herceptin (2 doses left) and I'm on Lentrazole for 5 years . You need to talk to your BC nurse about this and you will find loads of support on this site Elaine xxx",
