      "Content": "afternoon I have breast cancer which was diagnosed on the 18th Jan 2018 and which is being treated with letrazole. Thankfully the tumour has shrunk, this they found out in August when I had clips put in so I was told I would just have regular checks. I had a mammogram four weeks ago and have just had a phone call out of the blue to ask me to go for a scan as there has been a change in the other breast, all this the day before my first oncology appointment. I am now confused and terrified and just want to run away and scream, please has anybody else had this xx",

I am just counting down the hours till I am back upto the breast unit today at 12. Keep strong and if you need to shout or scream or  chat just pop me a note and I will be there for you xxx",
