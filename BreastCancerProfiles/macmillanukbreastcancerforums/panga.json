      "Content": "I have a something called Poland Syndrome, a birth defect that means you are missing a breast. I had an implant 15 years ago to help with this. A couple of weeks ago I found a pea size lump in the same breast. I had a mammogram and ultrasound, but because of the implant the consultant says he couldn't do a biopsy. And as he wasn't sure whether it was benign or cancer that I would need a lumpectomy. Only then will they be able to tell what it is. Has anyone had a lumpectomy with a breast implant here? I was also wondering how long the waiting list on the NHS for this? And how long the recovery time is? I'm not very good at all this waiting!! Thanks Panga",
