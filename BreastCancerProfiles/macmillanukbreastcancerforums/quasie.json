    "Content": "Dear Balletbird, When I first logged on to this site in October 2014 I asked the question regarding if anyone was on letrozole., I didn't have a clue what I was doing and so when I decided to log on tonight I discovered that my question was still where I had left it lol. I have just read with interest your experience and knowledge of letrozole and femera. my oncologist prescribed femera for me, I think it must be 3 yrs ago now, but when my GP gave me the prescription the pharmacist said that she was having difficulty getting it for me and that she would order the generic letrozole which was the same! I had no idea that there was any difference so I have been taking letrozole all this time. Like yourself I had been on HRT and was told to stop using it immediately by the breast cancer nurse as soon as I was diagnosed, I have been going through night sweats, hot flushes etc ever since., this along with extreme exhaustion and already having osteo arthritis, I had tp adapt to the pain getting worse. My GP has me on anti-depressants as he seems to think this is what's causing my tiredness and lack of lustre.  but I believe that I am depressed because of the side effects that I experience from this tiny pill that I have to takeI    Initially I spoke to my GP about it, a lot. then when I felt like I was losing my mind I decided to phone the breast cancer nurse at the hospital and tried to explain to her how I was feeling, she told me that I had no option but to take the medication prescribed for me, so I decided not to bother the oncologist about it. I probably could not try out any other medication as I have a mechanical heart valve which means that I have to take warfarin for life and this is why my oncologist chose femera for me., but I had no idea that there was even the slightest difference between femera and letrozole. Thank you so much for bringing this to my attention, I don't know how I will manage to convince my GP to change my prescription back to the original but I shall try, otherwise I shall have to wait until my next oncology appointment in May and see what the consultant has to say. I apologise for going on a bit, but I believe the side effects of letrozole are preventing me from enjoying my life and you are the first glimmer of light I have found. ",
