      "Content": "After recovering reasonably well - apart from cording - following Lumpectomy and SN just over 2 weeks ago, I found the last few days that my beast has become 'super sensitive' and now looks swollen and painful.  Just returned from GP who says I could have an infection and has given me antibiotics. Dilema - I am flying out to Spain on Friday for a much needed holiday, and I'm not sure if I should go. May be worrying unnecessarily but I would hate any problems/complications when in another country.I'm sure I'll feel much better by Thursday but can't help worrying whether to go or not... Also, I naievely thought infection would happen pretty soon after surgery - not  3 weeks later...?? What would you do? Thanks Jean",

      "Content": "Hi Wendy, I had a Lumpectomy and SNB on 27 October and waited almost 5 weeks for the appointment for my results - 29 Nov. I wasn't happy that I waited that long, and although margins were clear and nodes were clear, mine was also a Grade 3, and not Grade 2 as they thought before at biopsy. So my treatment isn't just radiotherapy as at first thought. Becaue of the aggressive nature of the cancer, I can't have drugs as they wont do anything, so I have been offered chemo followed by radiotherapy. My first session isn't until 12 Jan - I too was anxious about the long wait for appointments, etc, however, the Oncologist told me that chemo can start anytime within 3 months of surgery, so I wouldn't worry too much, although I guess like me, you would rather the sooner the better! Good luck with it all. It's pretty daunting not knowing what lies ahead with reactions, etc but hopefully it won't be so bad. Take care, Jean x  ",
