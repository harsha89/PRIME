      "Content": "Hey these are really good tips especially the soup! I was sat there thinking i could do with a warm bowl of soup!  I had my 2nd cycle of FEC-T on weds, had the cold cap again and if was more painful than the first time...i presume because my hair has thinned out? I got brain freeze straight away it was awful but managed the full 3hours.  I take paracetamol 30mins before and bring a warm throw and fluffy socks. Im going to try the heat pads nxt time and maybe the codeine? My friend sat with me this time and although she was lovely company to catch up at times i was so tired felt like a nap but didnt want to be rude..she wouldnt have minded!  Do you always take someone with you all the time or go alone? I might suggest someone coming in 2nd half way through so i can have a quick nap!  Good luck to everyone having chemo this month and the cold cap.xxx",

      "Content": "Hi, im new to this site, although have been reading all posts since being diagnosed. I have Invasive Ductal Carcinoma stage 3 in left breast with high grade DCIS and 1 lymph node involved. ER and PR positive and HER2 neg. Had my masectomy on weds recovering well, but read my letter to GP and it says metastatic lymph node. Doesnt metastatic mean its secondary cancer? Been positive up until now. They also said I will need chemo and im worrying of its actually beneficial or not? ",

Probably around same time as you. Its so good to hear from someone thats same diagnosis at around same time...at least im not freaking out on my own!! They havent said anything about my other nodes yet, i presume they will at my nxt appointment but i will look out for that trial. Im 43 how old are you? Are you happy about having chemo? Im in 2minds about it, its hard to make a decision but they said I need it? Maz x",

      "Content": "Thanks yvonne, yes that really has helped, i feel a lot more positive now. Mines grade 3 so that'll probably be why i need the chemo too. My consultant said its stage 1 at moment but will know more when results come back from histology. Its nice to know your back at work and your treatments behind you, i look forward to this too.  I just happen to be going through a house move as my chemo will start, have you got any tips? Ive heard it really drains you and leaves you susceptible to infection, dreading it as ill be wanting to scrub and clean my new home as you normally would.  Thanks again for all your advice its greatly appreciated.
