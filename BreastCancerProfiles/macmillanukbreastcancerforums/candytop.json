I have been hiding my peripheral neuropathy and movement problems ronstar She's lovely and really informative but said I now need to consider myself back to square one with it all Hi Ronstar. just read this. Did she tell you about using Hydrotherapy for getting your arm and shoulder moving? can you go into a Hydrotherapy pool, after your particular treatment.?? If so go back to her and ask her to refer you to your hospitals nearest hydrotherapy unit. and get an assessment from them and a program set up. If you have no luck there then DIY.: look up all your nearest gyms public and private. and see which have a hydrotherapy pool. Then go on youtube and look up hydrotherapy exercises for arm and shoulder. there is a guy in new zealand who is very good and shows what to do when you get into the pool I did this before I got diagnosed with breast cancer. As I already have several illness. and waiting around for anyone to help me meant I just would not get well. good luck be strong xx",

I finaly got a district nurse round to look at it and she agreed it is. It took six hours and twelve phone calls just to achieve this. we then went through the saga: its not my job. its the GP job to look at a wound and say if it is infected or not. We don't give antibiotics. we don't have dressings did they send any home with you. This experience has been the worst in my life and I am not talking about the cancer itself, strangely enough. \"we will look after you\", is a sick joke. sorry but this is my experience. and as I say, I am not impressed. and unless they get their act together, I will not  be listening to any more advice about further treatment.",

Or the nxt one is  next week. so much for we will look after you. my dog is better looked after. sorry but I am very upset and angry about this. I put my trust in them and it took a lot for me to do that due to many years of abuse by the medical profession. I will not be trusting them again. sorry to say this.",

It's because the nurse was pulling at the stera strip after taking the dressing off. that this started. I tried to say that I thought I had read somewhere that the stera strip is left on to drop off normally, but she said she didn't know and carried on tugging at it till she got it off!!!",

Hi Carolyn your quite right. there was a powder called sterzac?, was always used on the umbilical cord, also on wounds. but it was taken off the market some years ago. If I was still with the horses I would be using sulphur powder on the wounds. in a puffer on a wet wound and a cream base on a dry one. it was marvalus stuff and heald without scaring. but nhay lass, I am not with the horses anymore.lol",

My bus has 32 seats of women my age all with the same type and stage of cancer. all had mastectomy and all waiting for results of lymph node biopsy, presuming it to be clear, as was indicated by mammogram and scan and axilla scan. prior to surgery. according to your 1 in 8 figure then four of my seats will be affected by chemo but the driver has no idea which four.and if that effect will be good or bad? so I suppose the question is. do I get the next bus or not :)",

      "Content": "Hi Fiona72. I am 69 and was diagnosed in October HER2+ I have several illness and am not a good candidate at all for reconstruction. I had originally agreed to a lumpectomy but was advised to have a mastectomy. I had my left breast removed at the beginning of December. just over two weeks ago now. I stayed overnight on ward to make sure I was ok. the district nurses called to my home after that. I am small breasted so in my case this is now a good thing because it is not as noticeable clothing wise. I have decided to go flat .is the term used. if you don't want to wear a prosthesis.  I am getting used to it but sad naturally. I would try and put your emotions to one side and look at the reasons you are being given .not to have whatever it is you feel you want. Then if you still want the same. ask for a second opinion or change altogether if poss. to another hospital preferably with recommendations. I have had a problem with infection but am getting that sorted out and other than this. I am feeling much stronger. I hope you find your answers and get what is right for you personally also your health. take care be strong try not to panic. big hugsxx",

I have had a Mastectomy at the beginning of December. See you in the new year was the last thing the oncologist said to me. so what do I need to worry about. come the new year no doubt I will get a letter telling me to go see the oncologist. I am going to have a good Christmas. eat lots watch all the silly films I love. hug my kids grandchildren and great grandchildren and thank god I am blessed to be sharing this moment with them all.

These activities might also give someone an insight into what it's like to be disabled or blind but no one would consider doing them because they'd be seen as insensitive. You must be joking..... loads of people do exactly that and on tv too. People are insensitive until it happens to them. then they see things from a totally different angle. I have seen some of the ladies having heads shaved for charity with people standing round cheering on (because it wasn't happening to them) I looked in the eyes of the person being shaved, seeing the utter devastation and sadness. yet still trying to smile. no doubt for fear of letting the side down.!

I have a neurological disease plus I am under the care of an Immunologist for allergies. Don't see him very often as it is something I manage now by myself Hi Flopsyuk. I think you have written it perfect. scary but true. Sorry Rox do lots of research read between the lines of those on these sites and you may come to the right conclusion for you. I too suffer with many and varied illness, allergic reactions mostly to drugs. including prednisolone which I think they use as a cure for  some reactions? I have decided not to have any chemo after my mastectomy. I am lucky, I do not get anaphylactic shock but you are right ,they put the rest down to side effects. they should try having them, I am sure there opinion would change pretty quickly. I would like to start a group for men and women like ourselves who do suffer reactions and the devastation it leaves us with alone and self managed, which is really another word for neglected. I would like the same support the rest of patients get in dealing with cancer after surgery and it just does not seem to exist. it seems it is taboo to say no so that's your lot. anyone else feel this way I wonder? I do hope that you get your strength back and can deal with all the cr** that comes your way with regard to this.big hugsxx",

The good thing is that it is all being checked out quickly for her. they will do tests and sort out if there is anything to do about it. It is easy to say but most difficult to do but worry is not going to alter this one bit. so try to carry on as you have planned for christmas make it extra special for all of you  and I hope the news is good when she gets it.
