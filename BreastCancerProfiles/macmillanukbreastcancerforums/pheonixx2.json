      "Content": "Welcome to the 'club' that none of us wanted to belong to! I'm so glad that you have found this site because we are all here to support each other, no matter what type of cancer or whether patient or carer. I'm sorry that you have to make such a big decision at a time when your mind must be reeling with shock. There will probably be others along soon who have been through what you are going through and share their experiences but no one would be able to tell you what to do. I would suggest you write down all your questions and then talk to the doctor's, counsellor's and MacMillan Nurse until you feel they have been answered as fully as you need. Good luck with whichever route you take. Take care pheonix xxx",

      "Content": "Hi there,just wanted to say hello and welcome you to the 'club' no one wants to be in lol! It was a good idea to do a seperate post as more people will get to see it. I do not have your type of cancer but as a woman I can appreciate what must be going through your mind. What a roller-coaster for you in such a short time! There are quite a few ladies that have been in your situation and either just starting the journey or coming to the end who hopefully will be posting here soon for you. Just wanted to wish you lots of luck with whatever you decide to do. You are not on your own Take care pheonix xxx",

      "Content": "Hi Penny, sorry if it looked like I was being nosey or abrupt in my previous post. I asked because I thought you were after something specific and wasn't sure what you needed lol. I live in Wellington, is that anywhere near you? I was diagnosed last August with a Malignant Melanoma on my inner right ankle and was treated wonderfully by all the staff at Musgrove. Thankfully after surgery/skin graft and sentinal node biospy and then a punch biopsy on another 'suspect mole' I have been given the all clear and gradually getting back to normal. I understand how you are feeling. It came as a shock to me and my family that I had cancer and the waiting for tests/results/treatment is really hard and everyone on here will know exactly how you are feeling about that! Feel free to send me private messages if you want someone to talk to who is 'local'. Take care pheonix xxx",
