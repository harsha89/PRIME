      "Content": "I can see at times there are reasons why a persons privacy has to come second to treatment, but I know sometimes privacy isn't respected when it should be.  I had a male radiologist come in and have a conversation about lunch when I was I was lying down and exposed when I had a procedure before my first op. I have been asked so many times to come into a room and get undressed, walk over to a bed a lie down with people in the room watching. (All it would take would be a screen in the room to get undressed behind and a front fastening gown to put on.) I was put on a mixed ward after my mastectomy . I have like many women experienced a lot of trauma and sexual abuse in my childhood and have had a diagnosis of  post traumatic stress. Having cancer and going through treatment is traumatic enough, but for those of us that have also experienced sexual abuse it is traumatic on different levels. I also work with women who are survivors sexual abuse and so many are frightened to go for routine screening because of triggers to their past abuse, I know lives could be saved with an understanding of good sensitive practice guidelines being introduced. Sorry - Rant over, but it does really upset me. Hannah",

I rang the hospital and was told it was really important to get someone else to look after him as it could be dangerous if u havent had chickenpox yourself and having chemo. I too didnt have anyone to look after him and was told by a nurse to ware gloves and protective clothing when looking after him - impossible when u have a poorly 2 year old coming in for a cuddle in the night - anyway they gave me anti viral tables and I was fine. I was led to believe it was a risk if u havent had chickenpox yourself - but I must admit I was given conflicting information form different health professionals. Hope u say well and sending a hug to you and your daughter X Hannah",

Everyone is different and reacts differently, and also probably depends what job you do and if they are supportive. I worked through a lot of chemo time except the first week of each chemo, and worked through rads, although sometimes worked from home cos i think it was my way of coping, but since I have finished I cant get up in the morning and just cant stop sleeping - relief probably!
