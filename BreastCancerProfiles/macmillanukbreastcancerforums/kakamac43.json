    "Content": "Hi Hannah, I had a mastectomy, chemo (3 FEC and 3 Docetaxel), radiotherapy and am now on herceptin and Tamoxifen. The only time I ever felt unwell was when I was on chemo as it is really wicked stuff! So I can understand your mum's fears. I don't think the fear will ever go away but what I can say is that I feel well ie I do not feel ill. I do get tired but I can do everything I did before diagnosis. Hope this reassures your mum. Regards, Karen",
