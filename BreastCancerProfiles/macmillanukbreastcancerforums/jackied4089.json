    "Content": "Hi, yes I had radiotherapy 2years ago and where I was red and peeling then, still gets very sore and peels now. Did ask in the radiotherapy unit about this, and was told it was not the radiotherapy, well , it's in the same exact place, and when flared up, looks like I just had the radiotherapy. Very difficult to wear a bra, even a soft stretchy one, and gets even sorer when I get a bit sweaty under there. Feel very sorry for you, is very uncomfortable, but all I get is denials that it has anything to do with my treatment, which I think is a lie, or they just don't look into it. The nearest I got to them saying anything is \"it's better than being dead\", well thanks a lot, seem to get that  sort of answer all the time. Yes, I appreciate my treatment, but I would like to get on with a so called normal life, but surely there is no need to feel uncomfortable all the time. I was told, (off the record) it was because the skin is damaged in the area, much thinner, and so anything rubbing, or sweaty acidity causes the skin to break down.",
