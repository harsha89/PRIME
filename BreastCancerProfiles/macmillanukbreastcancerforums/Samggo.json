    "Content": "Hi, I am new to this site!! I hope I am posting this on the correct group !!!Â  My mum was diagnosed with pre invasive cancer in October 2014 and had her operation to remove the lump and some of her lymph nodes on the 4th of November 2014. She is a strong mum of 5 daughters, her husband of 22+ years (our dad) walked out on us of August 2013 and since then she has struggled with her emotions and now since she found out she has breast cancer she is really struggling. We have no close family or friends since her dad (our grandad) died Christmas 2010. I am her oldest daughter and I am trying to hold our family together, but I am finding it very difficult on what to say to make my mum and sisters happy again. my mum had her check up on the 13th of November 2014 and to get the results of her lymph nodes, luckily that was all clear but the surgeon told us that the lump was bigger than expected and would either need to operate again or for my mum to have a masectomy On her breast. My mum was unsure on what would be best for her as she gets very panicky and upset. my mum has already has her ovaries removed as she was at high risk of getting ovarian cancer and she feels if she has the mastectomy she wouldn't feel like a woman. So my mum is just really unsure on what to do, whether to have the same operation again (which she has opted for) to remove it and risk it coming back or have the mastectomy which is a huge huge confidence thing for her. Please help me!!",
