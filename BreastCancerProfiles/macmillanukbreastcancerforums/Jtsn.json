      "Content": "Hi, in 2004 I was having investigations to see why I was anaemic when I was called for my first mammogram. Got a recall for that and found out I had breast cancer. Had lumpectomy and radiotherapy, no spread to lymph nodes. just completed radiotherapy when I had a colonoscopy and diagnosed with 2nd primary. Had right hemicolectomy and chemotherapy which took me some time to recover. So 2004 wasn't my favourite year. No further issues until 2017 when my hand and arm suddenly started swelling with lymphoedema. Lo and behold I was then diagnosed with incurable breast cancer. At present it's under control thanks to Palbociclib and Letrozole. I was 'lucky' as Palbo was just being allowed by NICE, first patient in my area to get it so my oncologist keeps a close eye on how I'm doing. So far it's been working well. Greedy eh!Â ",

      "Content": "Hi Lou, sorry I can't help you with info on Gemcarbo but if you put that into the search box a few comments do appear. Mainly with lung patients but they may be able to help with general info on side effects. My treatment is fairly new and I had to skip through a few groups to find others on it. Good luck with the treatment Janet xx",
