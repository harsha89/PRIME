    "Content": "Hi Amsml I have just had the results of my Xray and bone scan today and I have no trace of anything sinister there. However I still have the pain. My oncologist has suggested it may be something to do with nerve endings being damaged and has put me on tablets Pregabalin to increase my pain threshold. He suggested I .also keep takin the pain killers. I said I did not want to become addicted to them-cocodamol 30/500 and wanted to know what affect they were having on my internal organs ............. My best friend and the nurse looked at me as if I had 2 heads and replied.... I think it's a bit late to think about that after you've had chemo and Herceptin pumped in for 18 months!! I took their point . Have a good holiday and hopefully all will be well with your results too x",
