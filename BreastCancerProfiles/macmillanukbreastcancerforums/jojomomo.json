Tonight though feel cream crackered cant stop my thoughts whirring around, mainly about pre assessment for surgery..type etc and thoughts/anxieties about that....if i could turn my thoughts off id be fine. Hubbys gone to spare room as im so restless, i'll settle for a cuppa (more peeing) and Stephen Fry audiobook. Sleep pattern is all over since chemo, havent napped during day either for weeks.  Deep breathing, dimmed lights...and relax......",

All went well..had scans and wire insertion prior to theatre and then in and out in 2.5hrs..luckily work at the Trust had my surgery in so knowing ward staff well made the procedure much easier..psychologically.All in all not as bad as i was antcipating. I was however pee'd off post op tho..went to a Gynae ward overnight from Day Unit...had to request analgesics and at one point had 1.5hr wait for dose, also found my chart this am and saw they'd missed doses of Oxycodone last night and 6am that i was prescribed!..ggrr..luckily just about managed with PRN meds tho was in discomfort overnight. Fingers crossed for clear margins and nodes..find out results on 29th Oct. Home soon though and looking forward to recovering and then onto Radiotherapy...finishing just before Christmas...what a nice pressie thats gonna be.",

Farcical, incompetent and unprofessional from start to finish on that ward. I most certainly will be ringing BCN tomorrow as no post op instructions given to me either from ward staff...i however had sought these previously, but what if i hadnt been in the know? Total of 7.5hrs to discharge me, no wonder there are bed shortages, and am so disapointed that this occurred where i work. Also had had to have Flotrons on post op and overnight due to DVT risks but not given 10pm Fragmin as prescribed either..., but i do remember telling night nurse that i needed to have it...i was very tired and had then nodded off just after telling her. All in all not good, im not bashing the nhs...i do work in it and know how hard it can be but for the sake of pre planning discharges and simply following written prescriptions my experience should have been alot more comfortable.. Anyway, a bit sore and tired today but ALL the family have been round at points during the day, lots of goodies and flowers ...and then had lovely Sunday lunch made by my hubby, with our daughter her fella and my mum.. been spoilt rotten...so feeling the love once again.",

      "Content": "Hi... Sorry to hear re your wound issues. My advice and sadly born through experience is contact you BCN & insist on a review and once seen ensure you have a point of contact and plan if things should deterioate over the Christmas period. Just incase you need to know when, how,whom to ring and where you can access help/advice because soon services will be reducing due to Festive period...the Surgical team can liase with District Nurses re treatment advice. I had wound issues and needed further review over last Christmas...luckily i went straight to appropriate person as i had made sure i knew who that was beforehand...otherwise this time of year weekend/bank holiday and out of hours provision can be a mare. As for antibiotics..hopefully A wound swab was done and they can then see exactly which med to give for treatment of the bugs found...in meantime it'll probably be a 'cover all' antibiotic to initially treat. Hope you are healed and comfortable soon and that things have settled by next weekend. Jo",

Now day 50 post 1st Op - 3 ops down, 4 debridements and waiting further surgery before Crimbo for hopefully close & grafting. Have Vac Pac on which is working but really painful at times but sticking with it, its also so heavy! Has anyone else had to have a graft to their wound...tbh im cacking myself as fear this will be more painful than the wound! Had to cancel crimbo plans as probably better to be at home than in the Lakes where we'd booked.  Really want an end to it now..can't sleep, fatigued, in pain, i think i smell, ongoing restricted lifestyle still - cancelled umpteen planned events/meet ups. Worried re delay to Radiotherapy too...realistically this is gonna be end of Jan/Feb...how will that affect things? Also not taking Tamoxifen cos of recurring surgeries. Pee'd off, tired, losing my mojo. Rant over. Oh and now my VacPac is beeping..not working...sick of this sh!#.District nurses duly called.  ",

Hope it does same for you. Eat well..high protein diet, take Vit C and rest. Ensure youre supported by your BCN...contact them as it really is a psychological toll youre dealing with.  I had further surgery yesterday - op 4 -after having vacpac off to close the wound, fingers crossed this works.. unfortunately i reacted to all my dressing so my skin aint in great condition but we can but see and hope it doesnt break down again. Sending a gentle hug your way, keep yer chin up...it will improve but just takes time..its not easy but we are made of strong stuff. I had preadjuvant chemo and now awt radiotherapy too, HER&ER positive grade/stage2 invasive Ca...lymph nodes negative.

Had pre adjuvant chemo so am desperately hoping all is goid and i can move onto radiotherapy next and avoid another op. Why is 3am such a bogey time when all our little monsters come out from under the bed? Though saying that since diagnosed my sleep pattern is shattered and as most have mentioned i find myself reading, browsing t'internet or sipping tea till about 430 then i dose off again.  I love walking at the mo and have found the most comfy sports bra post op to wear so i can still have a jaunt around the lovely local countryside here. A few times while listening to music on these walks ive crumbled and shed gallons of tears....but always feel better when im home. Its easier to let go of all the baggage in my head when im on my own as also feel like my family expect me to feel better now ive had my op.Said to my fab hubby yesterday..'i dont want you to understand how i feel..just realise i am feeling this way sometimes' Hold on girls, time will pass by and soon we'll know what we have coming up next to help us overcome this s#!t disease.

Luckily the dressings haven't been an issue and discomfort to wounds bearable. Main issue burning sensation to axilla/inner arm from SNB surgery..but guess will resolve over time. Emotionally i've been all over the place post op, maybe due to fact i've felt relatively well and 'had time' to think about things whilst at home alot.... Im not sleeping well...few hours a night and waking early constantly over thinking things and worrying about my forth coming Appt. Can any one tell me how these things go..? I know i'll have wounds assessed ...im expecting alot of stitches out. The wound is different to what i expected and tbh more breast tissue has been removed than i thought too, about half size comparatively now...obviously im worried as to why now? .. im driving myself nuts!! Being a larger breasted gal im not bothered about new size and will ask about surgery to right side to 'even' things up in the future. What info is usually given to you from these post op appts...Node results, tissue results - ? re staging if appropriate etc, which im the most concerned about, ....i honestly think i'm more anxious now than at any other stage from my diagnosis thru chemo and surgery.  Any advice or experiences would be really helpful,...in training my mind to stop doing somersaults and just flipping calm down.

Theres been only very slight leakage and that was in first few days do hopefully all will come away neatly and easily. Thanks ladies for that reassurance and Bluesy i am literally focussing on one day after the next and am trying to stay positive...going out,seeing friends, Crimbo shopping, walks etc etc Im not too worried re wound, scars etc....Its more the outcome of results for the SNB etc as the thought of another op makes me quiver with dread. It seems all i've felt for 6 months is 'uncomfortable' and just want a few weeks break from that before radiotherapy starts. i'm also due to start Tamoxifen and restart my Herceptin next week (hopefully after it was suspended), when see my Onco Dr. I know i'm not the only one, i know i need to sort my head out and after all treatment is complete it will absolutely be worth it. Im just p!$$ed off, feel useless and sick of hearing myself moan....im getting on my own nerves.   ",

I'm in the position of having had my Husband become a 'Brave Shaver' last summer whilst i was recieving chemo.  He announced his plan and then began organising a BBQ event which we held at our home, inviting all our family and friends...he actually raised ££££s, to his credit....but i hated every second of it, so much it made me feel sick to my stomach watching it. He became more animated and excited as the event neared...putting the countdown on Social Media, and telling everyone how \"scared\" he was becoming at becoming bald. He had his head shaved yes...but as you say it didn't strip him in any of the ways the effects of chemo did to me. I didn't say anything as he truly had all the best intentions and it gave him something to focus on through some very tough times for both of us. I cried when he'd done it...im not sure if that was purely at his attempts to try empathise with how i felt -(big fail) - and he has a good heart, or relief it was all finished. What made me very angry though was his mum crying as she watched him...saying \"what have you done to yourself, you look awful\"...hhmm. Would i encourage others to do the same fundraiser as they support their loved one going through treatment...no definitely not, it's too hard to process at the time and i remember having to really fight to quell my anger and upset towards him. I thought him to be a complete insensitive arse. I guess its difficult to think of novel ways to fundraise and Macmillan do a fantastic job of it...but its not appropriate to all. Jo",

Very personal experience. I do admire any fundraisers but as said before, not all the methods they and organisations use. It is that time of year again...I have deliberately tried to ignore social media posts by friends re: their efforts for this campaign, because even after a few years it literally makes my stomach lurch...irrational maybe but still it has that effect. \"You \u2018fought\u2019 they said. You\u2019ve been so \u2018brave\u2019 they said  Yet you know, I know, anyone who has faced it knows differently  Cancer is not a battle.  There is no choice whether to fight let alone whether to win or lose.  No amount of courage no measure of cowardice can decide the outcome.....\"",

But be assured you will be surrounded by a fantastic team of professional helping you, this board and its members will give you invaluable support when you need it - its picked me up countless times, and you and youre family will find your way through this...we are all stronger than we initially thought we ever could be. Take youre time to adjust, be kind to yourself, take one stage at a time and take every opportunity you have to talk to your friends, family and anyone who lends you a shoulder to lean on and time to talk...be honest about how you feel with those you feel you can be to.

This will definitely take me beyond a year of initially commencing it in July. Hes reviewing in 2 months. Im now not having Radiotherapy.....risk of it causing wound breakdown is too much, and apparently local recurrence risk is \"piffling\" for me. Im relieved tbh.... so that effectively means apart from ?? resuming Herceptin and Tamoxifen i've completed treatments!!   Im not counting wound dressings of course....im looking at the positives.

Question is how effective have those 7 doses been for me?....as its very unlikely i'll restart it as deemed to be main reason for wound not healing and hypersensitivity, which still have a couple of months yet before fully does so, tho thankfully atlast (!!after alot of trial and prayers with dressings) that has started to occur now Herceptin levels reduced in my system. I had read that it stays systemically for upto 7 months. Is there an alternative to Herceptin? I see my onco on Thursday and want to be armed with questions, i dont want to now have the fear of recurrence/under treatment cause me sleepless nights....ive had enough of those. Thanks Jo.",

I too read the trial re 6 months rather than a years course....have to believe 7 doses are better than none. Am now alternate day dressing..yay!!..may not seem it but its fab to say that...onwards & upwards.  (Hopefully). Jo.x",

Have to be in onco unit for atleast 4hrs for monitorring...got my audio books and bits n pieces organised, im not good at sitting in one place for too long.

Also consultant reviewed my Tax dose due to side effects id had esp pain, dizzyness and breathlessness...he said they were Stage 2 Side effects..??? anuone know what this means?....so reduced the dose of Tax and stopped the GCSF injs as said with new lower dose that i don't need them. Glad on one hand as may be easier this time round but a little worried that may be more risk of 'under treatment' as im having Neo adjuvant chemo.

Has anyone else had to have any Skin Grafting done?? Whats' it entail, do they use suturing to secure it,how long were you in for etc etc. Couldn't sleep last night as i'm so very nervous re more surgery - will be my 7th op, and secondly as i'm allergic to adhesive dressings, i'm really worried how they'll stabilise it enough for the graft to be able 'to take' and keep it covered with a dressing. I'm still using elasticated 'inco' pants to hold current dressings on and at times they 'slip'. To be honest the thought of anymore potential failed procedures or complications has made me cry - alot, but trying to get it to heal naturally isn't happening...my choices are limitted and all i want is this to be over, i'm so tired of it. So any info, advice will be greatly appreciated. This disease is a ba$#a\u20acd but the treatment for it has been equally as terrible for me. Thanks. Jo.",

I was wondering what advice/guidelines have been given to folk re: taking Tamoxifen and long flights.

I was told by Onco-plastic Surgeon to stop it 2 wks before surgeries but didnt ask re flights. GP was unsure, she did try research it but found conflicting info from different health trust/BNF etc. She did say \"it was probably sensible\" to stop for short period but was sorry couldn't give definitive advice.

      "Content": "I do really feel for you...VacPac is so hard to tolerate, not just physically but it does work well. I dont mind you askng at all love.  I had therapeutic mammoplasty after nro adjuvant chemo for stage 2 IDC& DCIS....clear margins and nodes so all good. Wound broke down and became necrotic along suture margin. Then had 2 debridements under GA  and 3 debridements in clinic ...had vac pac on for 3 weeks but had allergic reaction to adhesive dressing...hydrofilm used to secure it. Skin was a right mess but plastics worked wonders and 4th/  last op was Advanced Flap to  close the wound on 10th Dec. Still issues and had further revision & suturing to wound today after it dehisced slightly & Still need further procedure next week to hopefully fully close problem areas i still have. Sounds meh but believe me after all the assaults its had my boob looks surprisingly ok...scarred yes but i am so grateful for the skills of my surgeons. Hang in there, it may not seem like it at times but you will heal....be kind to yourself and take it easy. Be thinking about you, best wishes Jo",

      "Content": "Hey...i started my hormone therapy 2 weeks after initial surgery in Oct 15 but was stopped due to wound issues like youve had...vacpac, need for further surgery - due to thrombosis risk with it....once they were confident that no more surgery was needed it was restarted. I also awt RXT...but alas now been told i probably need further surgery in a few weeks so it'll be stopped again! Hope you get some answers from your onco team.x",

Around my eyelid and eyebrow...not painful, just like an exagerated muscle tick you get when tired sometimes. Now im day 12 post dose  and both my eyebrows are doing a mexican hat dance...all the time, its driving me nuts!! A bit of a strange question i know......",
