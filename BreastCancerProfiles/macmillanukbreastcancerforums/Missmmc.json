      "Content": "I am I am awaiting a mastectomy but not yet had SNB. However, my mother had to have a mastectomy at around the same age as me (57) and refused chemo. This did not seem to have had an adverse affect on her as she lived another 15+ years before dying of alcoholism! I don't like the idea of chemotherapy myself and will be taking an alternative natural substance which has had great results where it is legally available in the USA.Â ",
