    "Content": "i finished my treatment exactly 2 years ago ( chemo and radiotherapy) then was put on Anastrozole. This made me very tired so it was changed to Tamoxifen.  After 8 months on Tamoxifen, ive been changed medication again due to the side effects ( migraines, extreme tiredness, aching sore muscles, blurred vision and now have a cataract forming). My new medication is Exemestane, and ive been on this 3 weeks now.  ive come to the conclusion that whatever medication you are given, has side effects, so I know I just have to get on with it until my 5 years is up ( 3 to go ). Has anyone else had these problems with their medication?  I feel such a fraud for complaining because I survived breast cancer,and there are other women out there who are worse off than me, but I just want to kow when I will be normal again, and be able to do what i used to do,  and does it get any better when the medication stops? I would love to hear from anyone who has had this experience with their medication. Best wishes, Joan.",
