    "Content": "Hi Debbie - I'm new to the site and like you have just started FEC - had my second dose last week.  It has really helped me reading the replies to your questions - so thank you to everyone how replied to you. My first FEC wasn't too bad but the second was worse as my vein reacted badly and my arm ached like hell - it felt like my vein had shrunk in length and gone hard.  I am going to have a picc fitted before the next dose (i have to have herceptin for 12 months too so the picc can be used for that too).  I think this side effect is common from the postings on this site but it isn't listed anywhere in the official literature from the hospital and it worried me when it started as I had no point of reference. I lost my hair very quickly on day 14.  Shaved my head in the end and felt better for it.  The NHS wig looks fine but I don't find it very comfortable so make do with funky hats and scarves most of the time.  The nausea lasts with me for about 5 days and feels like a bad hangover - but I haven't actually been sick.  The drugs help and I have found that eating little and often helps - oat cakes to nibble on for example.  However, the steriod do make me want to eat the world and I haven't kept too much check on that but I can feel that I am putting on weight.  Like you I have had constipation and try to treat it with lots of fruit and veg and gallons of soda water as I seem to have gone off tea. coffee and other drinks.  My chemo team have a complimentary therepist attached to them and I have had some massage treatment with her.  She suggested a home brew for the sickness of chopped fresh ginger, lemon and honey with water.  It is really nice to sip hot or cold on the first few days after treatment - so I can recomment that. I hope that your next treatment goes OK.  Like you, apart from the arm,  it hasn't been too bad but I am expecting it to take progressively longer to bounce back each treatment - although who knows - we might be lucky!  I hope so! Best wishes Julia B",
