      "Content": "Hi Ann , I finished last Tuesday and am exhausted this weekend.  I have worked through my radiotherapy. They did say it might get worse before it gets better and symptoms last for 2to 3 Weeks after. I also think you concentrate on getting through it and when it's finished you physically and emotionally go phew ! I am keen to get back to the gym but am going to start just swimming. Here's to normal energy levels by next year ! ",

I have just started some counselling, I hadn't realised how angry I was at the randomness when I have done everything to keep fit , eat well etc and other people who have done nothing don't get it ! Keep going , this forum is great to realise so many people feel the same. X",

Wait for results , op to remove cancerous lump and lymph nodes then wait for results 6 week wait for radiotherapy has turned in to 12 week wait . It is all about the waiting !!!whatever results are stay strong you'll get through it .",

I finished radiotherapy November.  I spent the whole time feeling positive and grateful that my lumps were found through family history screening and I would not need chemo . I am having counselling and am back at the gym however my confidence is rock bottom and I feel permanently anxious . We will all get there is am sure it will just take time .I saw a quote ' I didn't survive cancer to die of stress ' ! Very true x",

      "Content": "It seems having a milestone birthday and holiday plans is pretty common! I was diagnosed a few weeks after my 50th birthday in June. I was going away to see my son be best man that week. Like the others have said everyone's journey and feelings are different.  I have had lumps and lymph nodes removed and start radiotherapy on 30th and am taking Tamoxifen.  I have not cried at all as I am so relieved it was found , not spread so no need for chemo. I am sure it will hit me at some point. Keep talking and get through in chunks, look for the positives , I have been overwhelmed by people's support .Keep your sense of humour too.My boob has been nicknamed Smurf as it has a blue circle from the radioactive dye and now folds over like a Smurf hat Good luck ",

      "Content": "Hi Lizzie. I have been taking Tamoxifen for 2 months. The first few weeks were the worst . When I wasn't having hot flushes I was nauseous, it was like being pregnant and menopausal at the same time ! That has settled now . It is still causing havoc with my periods being anything from 5 weeks to 2 weeks apart. I am in the last week of radiotherapy, when I saw the nurse she said it usually takes 4 months for the Tamoxifen symptoms to truly settle.  So keep going , hang on in there and hopefully you will feel better soon. ",
