      "Content": "Hi so sorry for the delay. I asked the nurse at the time what the alternatives were and they said that I could ask the Dr in the hospital to try to fit it. It was so much easier and much more comfortable. It's no trouble, I have it flushed weekly and wear a little scarf or bandana over it when I'm out. If the Dr hadn't been able to fit it I would've had a portacath instead. Good luck with the treatment xx",

      "Content": "Hi there I am sorry to hear you had problems having your picc line fitted, this happened to me when the nurses initially tried to fit the line it coiled in the vein and after a number of attempts they gave up - not a pleasant experience. I felt that my chest had been fiddled about wth enough after having surgery so I particularly wanted the picc as opposed to the portacath so the Dr tried and as he had better equipment this was successful. So it may be worth asking. good luck",
