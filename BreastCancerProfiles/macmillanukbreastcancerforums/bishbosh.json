      "Content": "I thought that I would pass on something I learnt whilst having radiotherapy for breast cancer and hope that it helps anyone in the same predicament. I developed some radiation burn under my breast which caused me discomfort and thereby lack of sleep. I contacted my breast care nurse who advised me to go to Boots. Purchase a bottle of aloe vera put it in the fridge to cool. Then spread it on the affected area. Sheer bliss and it works. Much better than aqueous cream.",

      "Content": "instarted chemo on the 11/12/2006.  My hair bean to fall  on the Thursday after Boxing Day. Firstly I didn't like the idea of the plugbecoming  blocked up with hair.  Secondly why not put your problem of hair loss to good use.  Like the ' Princess Trust'?  This would give so much pleasure to a little persons distress levels.  So go ahead and get that hair cut and feel great about your very kind gift. Good luck in your journey.  Xx",
