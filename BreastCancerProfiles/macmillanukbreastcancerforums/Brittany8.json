      "Content": "Hello Dreamthief, Thank you so much for this thoughtful response. It\u2019s much appreciated! I have looked at my blood test results and do not see any of those markers noted. I guess it\u2019s not much help then. Yesterday I received the written results from my mammogram and ultrasound. The radiologist deemed my Bi-Rads score to be a 5. Looks like that\u2019s the highest score possible, so I\u2019m preparing myself for an official diagnosis. My breast biopsy is this Friday, 7/13. Hoping I won\u2019t have to wait too long for my results. Take care & thank you, again! Brittany",

      "Content": "Hi All, I\u2019m new here. After testing positive for a PALB2 mutation last May, I started annual mammograms. The 2017 mammogram was inconclusive due to breast density. However, my 2018 mammogram (7/3/18) showed a suspicious finding in my left breast. I had a breast ultrasound immediately afterwards, and the radiologist said that there were 3 most likely benign masses in my right breast and a 1cm suspicious mass in my left breast. He showed me 2017 mammogram to point out that there was something on my left breast then but it was much smaller. (Not sure why they deemed that one inconclusive last year, when even I could see what he was pointing too.) So I\u2019ll be getting all 4 lumps biopsied Friday 7/13. Separately, I had a CBC w/diff on 6/29 that came back normal. My question is whether I need to worry about the suspicious lump being cancer if my blood is normal? Would breast cancer affect my CBC results? Thank you so much I\u2019m advance.",

      "Content": "Hi Dreamthief, Thanks so much. I was lucky to get my results back in just 3 days. It did come back positive, Ductal Carcinoma. They are still testing for the markers. My doc said the next step is an MRI & meeting with a breast surgeon. He said I\u2019ll definitely need surgery and then radiation. Since I have the Palb2 mutation & family history of BC, the radiologist already recommended I get a double mastectomy.  I will join in the other chats. Thanks again. Brittany  ",
