    "Content": "Hi Amanda I am new to this forum and I agree with you that it is a massive help to know that there is so much support and advice out there. I wanted to let you know that I had the same procedure about 2 weeks ago. I had the radioactive dye injected and then had surgery a few hours following that. The injection is very straightforward and I didn't find it painful at all. I think the worst bit was just the waiting for the actual surgery after I had the injection. Like you though, I just wanted to get the lump removed and get it out and that was my attitude right up to surgery. It has been a relatively easy recovery and compared to ovarian surgery I had at the start of the year, I found this post operation recovery process much easier. I am having to go back for more surgery next week as they want to remove some pre-cancerous cells that have been picked up. I feel I should be getting used to the surgery process....(this will be the third one for me this year) so am trying my best to remain calm and not worry. I wish you all the best for your surgery and if you have any queries on the procedure let me know. All the very best, Jennifer",
