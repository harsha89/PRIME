All this is doing my head in and I am finding it so hard to sleep or think straight it's all the not knowing and if I have passed it on to my children. xxx",

      "Content": "for the pass few weeks I have had Itchy skin under my armpit at the side of my left breast, for the past few days my breast has hurt and painful if I sleep on my tummy or couch even just sitting and touching it also my nipple at the bottom seams a different pink  never noticed before, the top of my breast seems wider. I am unsure if to get checked or am I just worrying because I  have been informed about brca2 not had a mammogram, just worried that the dr will think it's all in my head. I think it is prob in my head.                                               thank you                                                              Shelley.",
