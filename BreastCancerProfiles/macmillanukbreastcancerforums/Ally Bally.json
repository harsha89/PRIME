    "Content": "hi all does anyone out there have a colectomy with internal j pouch.  If so how are you coping with the fec chemo.  I had my first chemo on 1/10 and my poor tummy has suffered let alone very sore bottom with haemorrhoids.   I am trying to keep on top of each problem as it occurs to save it getting worse. Would appreciate your views and experience.  ",
