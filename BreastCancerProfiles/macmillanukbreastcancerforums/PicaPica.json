      "Content": "Hello I had a double mastectomy and lymph node clearance last autumn. Surgery was in the afternoon and I wasn\u2019t back up to the ward until the evening so it was definite an overnight stay. I had drains in both sides and those were a right fiddle, to get to the toilet with the tubes and bottles. Some people seem to manage those fine, but I found them complicated to manoeuvre. So when the surgeon came round and said I could go home (this is day 2), I asked if I could stay another night and hoped the drains would be out the next day. And that\u2019s what happened. Drains removed on day 3, and home in the afternoon. I\u2019d felt fine throughout, not groggy or anything. Just the faff of the drains. Hope this helps. Best wishes to you for your hospital stay. x",

      "Content": "Hi cathclmb  I think I\u2019m in a similar position to you. I had a double mastectomy in October 2017, followed by radiotherapy in January. Now on anastrozole and bone infusions. I had my follow up meeting with the oncologist in March and asked about future testing and was told that there won\u2019t be anything. I\u2019m to contact them if I have anything that seems suspicious. All sorts of lumps and bumps around my scars so feeling for changes isn\u2019t straightforward! The BCN nurse said to watch out for sudden unexplained weight loss, or pain that won\u2019t go away despite painkillers. And that\u2019s it! I felt quite abandoned really. They seemed to be saying you\u2019re in your own and it\u2019s up to you to be vigilant. And following on from regular appointments and checks since last autumn, that felt very weird. But I\u2019m coming to accept it now. Not much else you can do really, I don\u2019t think? Do you know if anything else we can ask for? If there were any scans available I would consider paying for them privately, I think ... I\u2019d be interested to know if you find anything. I know women are, rightly, very anxious about the yearly follow up mammograms, and it seems that we don\u2019t even have that. Maybe having no breasts removes that worry! I just don\u2019t know.",

      "Content": "Hello Four months ago, I posted about tightness in my chest. It\u2019s still exactly the same and I am posting again in the hope that someone reading now may have some ideas ... I had a double mastectomy last October, no reconstruction, SNB one side and ANC the other. Then 15 radiotherapy sessions, and now on anastrozole, and 6-monthly bisphosphonate infusions. My chest constantly feels as if a very very tight blood pressure testing sleeve is inflated around it. It feels compressed and uncomfortable and I haven\u2019t found anything that even begins to allay it. It began soon after the operation and got tighter after radiotherapy in January. I can\u2019t believe it hasn\u2019t happened to anyone else so I\u2019m reaching out again for advice. I have: - done all the arm and chest exercises three times a day. - asked the oncologist at the post-radiotherapy meeting and he said to just wait. - asked the radiographer who said she had no idea. - asked the BCNs who say it just takes time. - had physio therapy since December, trying weights, bands, compression tops, kinesio tape, massage. - asked my GP, who put me on amitriptyline, up to 50mg a day, to no effect. Now trying Baclofen as a muscle relaxant, on double dose, no effect as yet. I don\u2019t think it is a nerve problem. Nor do I think it is a muscle issue. I have good strength in my arms and pecs (considering!). It feels to me like very compacted scar tissue that just won\u2019t soften, and was made harder by the radiotherapy. And I think that I surely can\u2019t be the only person this has happened to. I\u2019ve now just started counselling because I feel that the medical folk have washed their hands of me and just wouldn\u2019t listen. The physio and my GP are the only ones who have listened and are persevering and trying to work something out. Are there any scans or tests I could request that would show what\u2019s going on in my chest? I wonder if my explanation isn\u2019t clear enough and whether being able to see something physiologically would help. One person has suggested surgery to cut the scar tissue and ease it - but then I\u2019d be sewn up again and don\u2019t understand why it would be any different. It\u2019s been ten months now and I\u2019m despairing of it improving. Please has anyone got any advice? Sorry for the lengthy post. x",

      "Content": "Hello Mrs.C I have an update on this chest tightness business! Saw my GP this morning and said I really didn't want any more random pills for muscles or nerves but what I really wanted was for someone to look inside my chest and see what was going on. So he did an ultrasound scan and it was really clear. Lots of 'loculated' seromas, dozens of tiny ones all encased in scar tissue hardened by the radiotherapy. So there's no way they can disperse. He said he could aspirate them, but there are dozens so it would be a lot of needle punctures with obvious infection risk, and each one may only hold 2-3mls of lymph. Plus the seroma walls may be hardened such that they wouldn't collapse when the fluid was drained. His other suggestion was that maybe I could have a regular local anaesthetic (every couple of months) so that I couldn't feel my chest at all - which is one solution. So I don't really have an answer, but I do feel that I've learned what's going on. Seeing the images on the ultrasound made it really clear. Soft tissue massage might be an answer for you, if you didn't have rads?? Let me know how you're getting on when you have a chance. x",

      "Content": "Hello again I hope you do manage to get an ultrasound booked. I think it helped me to see what was going on inside, and also for a medical professional to be able to see what I\u2019d been trying to describe. Where it leads though is still an unknown! But having a picture did help validate it somehow.  I find I can be positive when I have a few avenues to explore. It\u2019s when I seem to have exhausted them all, and am no further forward, that I feel low and turned to the counselling. But it is odd talking about myself for the whole session, and being encouraged to talk about the negative feelings when usually I try to look on the positive side. The counsellor says it all needs working through though. She compared it to me being on a boat that had set off but which hadn\u2019t yet reached a place of safety where I could rest. Seems apt! Wishing you well for your next appointment. X",

Where I live, the system is such that they can\u2019t take on anybody new so I\u2019ve been seeing a counsellor privately. I think it has helped me face up to the enormity of what has happened whereas before I was trying to be positive all the time and not accepting the huge changes that have happened in the past year. i will be interested to hear if your physio can find a way to relieve the tightness and by what methods.

      "Content": "Hello Mrs C. It\u2019s really good to hear from you. Very frustrating for your physio to not really have any ideas though. Mine tried a few things but nothing came close. I\u2019m amazed it can be so unusual. With so many of the same operations happening around the country, it doesn\u2019t make any sense that physios, doctors and nurses don\u2019t know of any treatment for when the constriction goes on and on. News from here is very little progress. I wrote to my original surgeon in August and then again in September, and had an email back last week saying that unfortunately the tightness was very common and that it was usually helped by nerve meds and massage. But that she understood I had tried these with no improvement and so she would get her secretary to book me an appointment at the clinic. She did say that further surgery was rarely considered as it could make things worse. So at the moment I am waiting for an appointment letter. No news really - but at least there is something booked, which might lead somewhere. Do you reckon you could ask for an ultrasound so you know more about what\u2019s happening inside? i hope the counselling seems helpful? I\u2019m still going to mine. I do find it makes me wallow in misery really - but the counsellor says it all needs to come out.  Thank you for keeping in touch. I\u2019ll let you know if I find out anything else. With best wishes to you. x",
