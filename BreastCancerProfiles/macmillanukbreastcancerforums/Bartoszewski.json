      "Content": "My name is Gary and I'mÂ On here trying to seek help and advice for my wife who has just been given the all clear for Breast Cancer but has been told she has Lobular Carcinoma in situ. She is worried that one day, because of this it may return and is considering a dbl bi lateral mastectomy with reconstruction but is worried in case something goes wrong. She isn't the type to ask for help but doesn't mind me asking on her behalf. Our main concern is what if the op causes severe disfigurement and she no longer feels like a woman? Or what if she doesn't have the op and it returns? She has had a course of radiotherapy at the beginning of her treatment and been on tamoxifen up until yesterday. I would be grateful for any kind of feedback from anyone who has gone through this procedure and the pro's and cons of both having and not having it.",

      "Content": "Hi Julia Thanks for your kind reply. In regards to the mastectomy the op has not been suggested by a specialist but is more something that Tracey is considering due to the fear of the cancer returning. Regards Gary",
