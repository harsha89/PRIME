      "Content": "Hi All. I am day 5 post op WISE pattern therapeutic mammoplasty and sentinel node biopsy for left breast cancer with right sided symmetrising reduction. The first 24-48 hours were the toughest ever. The pain was horrendous. It is now easing and I am improving every day. I see the surgeon on Wednesday for the results, check they have clean margins and lymph nodes are clear, I hope.  I have an awful pain in my left arm pit and my left arm is numb, I have a strange nerve type sensation which I cannot describe but my left arm feels very odd. If I can be of any support or offer advice to anyone having the same op please get in touch.",

      "Content": "Hi Jillybean. My cancer (left breast) was found via mammogram and was a shock but thank goodness for screening as my two lumps were found early. I had them removed, and the other breast reduced in size \"to match\" on September 5th. I was quite sore for a couple of days, keeping the dressings dry is a challenge, but my wounds have healed well. I also had 4 lymph glands removed which were, thank fully clear, but i have found my left arm pit is still tender and numb due to nerve damage. I am going back to work on Monday and will have 15 sessions of radiotherapy in around 4 weeks time. I have just started Tamoxifen too. Stay positive. You will have down days but that`s normal. Good luck on Tuesday x",

      "Content": "Hello Catherine. I didn't have a mastectomy but a large lumpectomy (two tumours close to each other). My surgeon advised me have my other breast reduced in size at the same time as the lumpectomy so I would be in proportion (I too have quite large breasts). As a result I had both breasts operated on. Go back to your surgeon and request breast reduction as soon as possible.  ",
