      "Content": "Hi Sara After my first one I had a couple of days of feeling low and weepy, but then I did pick up and felt a lot better. But after this second one, it has been far more intense and debilitating and now eleven days in and can't honestly say I am feeling any better. I am going to have a review on Friday with my Onc, because like you I'm not sure I can go on. Sorry if this isn't very encouraging but I do know everyone reacts differently and you might just pick up any day now. Good luck Honey Love Jac xxxx",

I was just wondering is their any thing that they can give you which can boost your mood when they give it to you, my brestcare nurse said for energy levels they can increase the steroids or give them for longer soi wonder if they have mood enhancers, or maybe just wishful thinking. I suppose antidepressant but they will take a while to get into your system. Thanks for your help Love Jac xxx",

      "Content": "Hi Sascha New to this site so not sure I am replying in the correct place, you asked if the cancer is in the lymph glands or lymph nodes I think glands it is under my arm, so they are going to remove all my lymph glands. I had a CT scan yesterday to check if it has spread, but because it feels quite a big lump I am terrified it has, but will know soon enough. I also have had a mammogram every year and they have all been clear. So feeling a bit fustrated along with all the other feelings. Thanks for your help Jac xx",
