      "Content": "Yes, the reason these two are not used for pre-menopausal women is because in pre-menopausal women the majority of the estrogen they produce is produced from the ovaries, in post-menopausal women this is not the case as their ovaries have ceased to function as such. The aromatase enzyme which is involved in the synthesis process can be found in many places from the reproductive orgrans to the skin and bone in a woman.  Hence they are 'aromatase' inhibitors which means they try to inhibit the aromatisation of androgens into estrogens by interrupting the synthesis of the same whereas Tamoxifen will be used for pre-menopausal women to 'block' the estrogen receptors rather than the production of estrogen. But not sure any of this answers Sascha's question.  From what I know, As there is little difference (except in side effects) between the two with regards to what they do, which one is prescribed is really matter of choice for the doctor doing the prescribing.  I think I said in a previous post that letrozole has been proven to very minimally give better results for breast cancer but yes the side effects can be worse.  So in effect, if you are on one and you suffer too much, your doc should be able to switch you over to the other.",

      "Content": "Hi gtips, Sorry you to have make this decision.  I had a mastectomy with immediate LD FLap recon last month.  It really depends on how active you are and what you do etc.  I preferred not to have the TRAM or DIEP because I know the loss of stomach muscles can eventually lead to a weaker back and I rely only upon myself to lift and carry allsorts!  Also I needed to have RT after surgery and my surgeon suggested that the Extended LD FLap without implant was probably the best option and most likely to suffer least through RT. My result is also pretty fantastic.  I am only a B cup but my breast is pretty much the same size and shape as the real one!!  Apart from the missing nipple you would hardly notice the difference.  It is slightly firmer, but not much.  I will have to see in about a years time whether I would need any 'lift' or adjustment to the old one to match once it has settled and RT has done its thing but otherwise I would leave it as it is. Recovery time for me was really only about 4 weeks I am now just 5 weeks (tomorrow) since surgery and I am driving and pretty much getting on with things as normal.  Most of the discomfort (would not really call it pain) has gone and I can now sleep on that side too and move around in bed which is great.  I am glad I chose the LD Flap but then I have nothing to compare it too personally. The only real restrictions for me are apparently when I play golf or tennis (ok ya - might have to cancel my membership of the club LOL!) and some other sports which I dont do anyway so life is gettign on pretty much as normal. The real questions you need to consider are, recovery time and help you will have during that.  What sports (if any) you do which is may affect, do you have a strenuous job where you lift and carry etc? and would you benefit from a free tummy tuck???  The success rate for the particular option you choose.  Some of the blood flow sometimes does not go right with some (can't remember which is more at risk) and whether you are having an implant etc. Hope this helps a little.",

I had DCIS and affected nodes, FEC-T for 6 sessons just like you and have just have mastectomy with recon, will be doing RT next month and still there are times when I feel like the last 6 months weren't real.  But you will get through it with help and support and don't be too proud or ashamed to rely on other people or accept help. Take it one step at a time.  Chemo first.  The next few months will be like an endurance test that you cannot walk away from but will feel proud of yourself for getting through at the end of it.  People who do not understand may say thoguhtless things, learn to tolerate them or stand up to them.  But there will be plenty of people who DO understand on here who will help too. Take it in stages, think of it like a project with milestones you can feel accomplishments when reaching.  You WILL be different this time next year but in a way the time will fly by.  A project for a new you, see it as a starting point, out with the old - in with the new. Oh and ramble all you like on here, we all do it when we need to. HUGSXX",

I think he is just making me aware of the risks and of my choices taking in account that I have young children (the youngest being only 3).

I was diagnosed with a grade 2 breast cancer in November last year and just like you, it was suggested that I have neo-adjuvant (pre-surgery) chemo to shrink the significant size of the lump (8cm x 7cm) in order to 1.  see if the lump reduces to a size which makes it possible to save the breast by a lumpectomy instead of a mastectomy and 2. if not, make the surgery a lot easier. You simply cannot expect or prepare for something in life like this.  It is a blow to everyone of us who have been diagnosed with breast cancer.  It really is a case of dealing with it when it comes and we all feel initially that we cannot cope.  Initially the chemo scared me, now i am half way through, it seems insignificant.  Now the surgery looming scares me but I am sure I will feel the same way about that once it is done.  It is a long pathway through treatment to get to recovery so taking one step at a time is the only way. The treatment they suggest is only that, a suggestion.  You of course have the right to refuse any or all treatment but you need to do so when you are fully informed.  It sounds like you need to talk to your oncologist or bcn and ask every question possible to fully understand why and how etc.  When I was given my news, I was given it by a doctor who seemed quite detached and unsympathetic and the way he explained things to me I thought I had no options and that mastectomy was going to happen no matter what etc.  However, the next doctor I saw (who will be my surgeon) explained things in quite a different way.  I also think I must have one of the best oncologists out there (not that I have a lot of experience with them), he has been so lovely and patient and answered every question I throw at him.  His name really is apt Dr. 'Goodman' as he really is a good man. For one, you cannot be expected to prepare for this when you feel so confused and for another you will be confused until you are fully informed.  Talk this over with someone first (maybe call the macmillan helpline - their nurses are lovely) and then prepare a long list of questions you need answering for your specific case and ask them of your medical team. You are allowed to panic and be afraid.  We have all been there - lean on us, lean on friends and family because you will need support through this no matter what you choose to do. I hope you stay on the forum and get the support you need here.  Good luck. XX",

As of today, it appears to be pretty much the same, no pain so I aint bothered too much but I just wondered if any of you out there had a similar experience and how long it took for the fluid to reduce? Its just such a weird feeling to press on my side and feel something moving in my back (a bit x files like). Any shared thoughts would be much appreciated.",

      "Content": "Thanks for your posts ladies.  I could not understand why they were so keen to take the drain out only 9 days after surgery but the nurse said it was a trade-off between infection and draining.   Clh, my nurse said the same.  I am reluctant to drain it unless it becomes painful as she assured me it WILL fill up again.  A couple of weeks sounds good though, I can cope with that.  Half a pint of beer also sounds good!! :-) I just wondered how long I could expect to have to have this fluid sack inside my skin.  Its weird but bearable.  I dont know if its my imagination but I feel like it gets smaller if I exercise the arm???  If that were the case, maybe I could exercises it all day and get rid of it!!

I am not a religious person per se.  Not in the generally accepted term.  I have however, followed for many years the beliefs of Confucious, Daoism and Buddhism.  All of these faiths express how important it is to respect others and consider your actions.  Its about the person you are not an external dependancy.  Buddhism in particular tells how we should consider the effect of our actions upon others and therefore act with care.  Whether good or bad, each interaction with another has some effect on them sometimes insignificant but sometimes not, and you never can be sure which it will be.   Your real-life, layman's story shows just how such small interactions can snowball into great things.  Never underestimate what may come from your seemingly insignificant day to day ramblings. Congratulations on your first anniversary but do be careful on those swings :-)",

With so many opinions what are we to believe?  A lot of women have it done to make their live easier and less stressful but I did also do some research myself and there is very little evidence to suggest that this preventative measure does what you hope it will do HOWEVER, the very fact that you may worry less may  mean that a more positive attitude helps as stress can weaken your immune system and that certainly does not help. I decided not to go for a double mastectomy.  Maybe you should try and get some more data or a second opinion before you decide. Good luck, it is not a nice poisition to be in.  XX",

The question is - Do you love her?  If you do, I would try and let her know this and that you are there for her.  Trying to make her change her mind will put pressure on her which she does not need.  Offer support at the moment, giving the relationship part a backseat.  Once her emotions settle, if she feels she made a mistake and over-reacted, at least she can come forward and tell you that. Nobody really knows except her, but space and support is your best chance at the moment.  Whether she realises it or not, she is going to need as much emotional support as well as practical support over the coming months. hope this helps Berny4",

She has to prioritise what she can deal with emotionally and if surgery is that close, she must be very anxious.  As I said before, when you are talking about life changing situations which affect something which you associate yourself with as being a 'whole' woman, (like your breasts)  it can be difficult.  I mean, imagine for yourself, finding out you have testicular cancer and have to have one or both removed, how would you feel as a man?  How would this affect your confidence in a relationship - even with someone you already love?  Cancer really has to be one of the hardest things to deal with.  It changes so much about you. I still have surgery to come and am not in a relationship at the moment and I am struggling to see how I can ever have a relationship again once I have completed my journey of chemo, surgery and radiation therapy.  And at 43 that is quite daunting to see the rest of your life as single because of this.  However, I have met several woman recently, who have come out the other end and they are so positive and confident with themselves and their changed bodies that I see hope.  This is why I believe, your (ex)girlfriend may see things differently in a while. Just let her know you are there and you love her without pushing her or smothering her.  I think you should also call the MacMillan helpline - They can help family of cancer sufferers as well too.  They may be able to give you a better understanding of her emotions etc at the moment.  Hopefully someone else on here will rspond and give you their perspective of how cancer and surgery made them feel within a relationship. Stick with it Berny4.  I think you may need some support here too.  Watching someone you love go through this and feeling helpless is hard.  talk to as many people as you can.",

KateG  I am sure you must be on commission from the nurses on the MacMillan hotline LOL :-0 I just had immediate recon with LD Flap but without implant.  Part of the reason I chose this route was because I am also due for RT and so was told it would be an added complication if I had an implant.  I cannot answer your question from first hand experience but I was told that - they will perform RT with the implant in place (it will not be removed for RT) however, RT can cause hardening of the implant at a later date so it may be that you will need it replacing in the future sooner rather than later. It is unfortunate, that you did not have the choice beforehand but they will work around it.  It may be that they will lower the levels of RT because of the implant to try and avoid problems.  It will also depend on where the RT needs to be focused. I do hope someone who has gone through the same situation can answer your question but your BCNs should also have some stats on the effects of RT on implants in cases at your hospital, they may even be able to put you in touch with someone who has been there and done that, so ask them.

I am in devon, I moved here just over a year ago.  Spent 6 months settling in then started to feel unwell, was diagnosed in november last year so I have never had a chance to get to know anyone locally.  All my friends live 250 miles north of here.  I have a friend on hand for up to a week after surgery and also my ex has agreed to take the kids for a week.  I have just been trying to get something in place just in case I need it.  I would have no qualms about immediate recon if it were not for the rt but the possibility of what it can do the a perfectly good recon job bothers me. I just wondered if anyone had had recon using natural tissue followed by rt and if they had had any significant problems or distortion of shape etc. This is the final hurdle but as I am so 'young' (as they keep telling me!) this recon will be the thing that lasts the longest and if it is horrendous due to rt, it will be a permanent very obvious reminder for the rest of my (hopefully) relatively long life.

I had my 3 Docetaxel through a canula and only my 3 FEC through the PICC, I so wished I had had the PICC line at the beginning.   So long as you are careful and wear the stretchy dodah over it to keep it in place, you soon forget its there and just get on with things.

My oncologist was just a little concerned that due to my age and the fact that my periods only stopped with chemo, that my ovaries may spark into action again so he wants me to have my levels checked for the next year or so to keep a close eye on it so I don't get put at risk of feeding the dreaded C again.  Once he is satisfied that they are dormant, he wont bother testing. I have sent you an email privately but please contact me if you need to talk.  I will be putting a little 'goodybag' together for you over the next few days so keep an eye on the postman - if he arrives smelling sweet and your goodybag does not, you know where it went!! ;-)  When I lived in Italy, my Victoria's secrets catalog always arrived opened!!! ",

      "Content": "Joanne, the pains you describe were exactly what I suffered on my first taxotere cycle.  I cried in agony from the back pain, which made me unable to stand, walk, sit or lay in bed without pain.  It lasted 2 days for me, with milder hip joint pains when I walked for about 3 days after that.  I told my oncologist about this and he immediately prescirbed gabapentin for me to take for 7 days starting the day after chemo.  I had no side effects whatsoever last time and asked for gabapentin again today so I hope this cycle will be as easy. its strange but I hear of so many on here who onc just says take ibruprofen or similar, perhaps even codine but the pains are neuropathic not muscular which I find strange.  Gabapentin is a drug that was originally used for epilepsy because it works on the nerve endings and controls spasms but was found to ease neuropathic pain and I assure you it works 100%!  Please ask your onc for next cycle.  Maybe I just have the kindest onc in the south. The diarrhea is normal but you should tell your doctor if it is excessive.  drink plenty of water (I usually go through 2litres a day on the first week) it helps flush the chemo drugs through your system quicker and will help with side effects. I am looking forward to FEC for my next 3 cycles as these is supposed to be a walk in the park compared to T!   Good luck.",

I had had enough of hair everywhere. Even my oncologist was suprised the next time I went to see him, he thought I would have lost it later.  I guess it depends on the person. As for the burning sensations, not sure, could be due to the chemo effect on your skin and causing some sensitivity.  I am having that at the moment on my hands and face after 3 cycles.  My skin is extremely dry and sensitive and my face all red and blotchy as are the backs of my hands and knuckles. Anything you are worried about, you should call your care nurse(s) I am sure they will put your mind at rest or ask you to see a doctor if they feel concerned.  Never feel that your concerns are too minor - its not like we go through this every day is it, but they do!",

Don't feel guilty, its not like this is going to be the way your life is forever is it?  I think with what you are dealing with you are entitled to fall off the wagon and go haywire.  Just eat whatever makes you feel good at the moment and be good when you can.  You have to do what you have to do to get through it.  there is so much pressure on you already, dont push yourself too much.  Let go for a while.

I, too, am really looking forward to my hair growing back as I hear that 8 times out of 10 if you had straight previously you could end up with curly hair when your new crop grows.  I have always wanted curly hair and have spent a fortune on perms and curling tongs in the past so I have my fingers crossed.  my daughters are also keen to see if it grows back the same colour or not!!  Its quite exciting.  How often can a woman have a hairstyle and hair colour change that is truly permanent??? Thanks for the Youtube video Libby!!  just what I needed right now, my eyebrows and lashes are definitely thinning out more and I am preparing for baldness there.  I think I am finding that harder to come to terms with.  Throwing a headcovering on but still being able to apply make-up as before and look pretty normal is ok but once your lashes and brows go, it gets harder and you definitely can look ill.   I think breast cancer was designed by a man to strip us women of all our dignity and make us humble but little did he realise that in the process of doing this - it makes us stronger in the end!!

I had Docetaxel first and my first session was horrendous.  It does not usually hit you until day 3 or 4.  I had sleeplessness because of the steroids, followed by incredible joint pain for which I was subsequenty given gabapentin (it reduced me to tears for 2 days) and then very tired for at least a week.  FEC gave me hardly any problems at all, just slight nausea and headaches within about 4 hours which usually passed within 24 hours.  It may be that you will sail through it but chemo has a cumulative effect anyway, so if you are tired now, just having more chemo will increase that.",

I am ER+ too.  I now no longer eat meat (the growth hormones pumped into animals for human consumption increases the Estrogen in our bodies, in addition to that, even with organic meats you are ingesting the animal's own hormons including estrogen), I do eat tofu (I follow the belief that the phytoesteogens are weaker than ours and can help block the receptors so the real baddies have nowhere to go to do any harm and anyway, phyto estrogens can be found in other veggies which are also on the list as 'good' things to eat to combat cancer). Switch to natural skin products if you can.  I now only use products made with shea butter, coconut oil, cocoa butter, aloe vera and the like.  These products are not expensive (sometimes cheaper than brands) and contain no harmful chemicals which can only serve to increase the hormone levels in our bodies as their seep through our skin.  Black soap is the only thing I use in the shower for instance.  You can buy in a block or in liquid form with Vanilla or other natural aromas.  Shea by Nature do some lovely products.  All the chemicals we ingest and slap on our skin are baddies. I even make my own laundry detergent and dishwasher detergent now.  Its not difficult and it cleans great! Check out diynatural.com for ideas. http://www.mybreastcancerjourney.co.uk/hormone-receptor-positive-cancer-how-to-reduce-estrogen-naturally/ A lot of cancer patients follow the Rainbow Diet, also by Chris Wollams.   Hope this makes a good start!!  Let me know if you need any more info.",

However, due to the fact that I had LD Flap recon, there was some swelling around the back and front and I have been unable to wear it yet but just as Mistmoley said, I would suggest the Ahh bra (Belvia or Genie Bras are the same).  Get a pack of 3 from ebay for £10.  They are indispensible and sooo comfy.  I have been wearing one since 48 hours after surgery and it offers just enough support without interfering with my wounds or sore areas.  I am only a B cup and I understand that the larger you are, the less support they may offer but are still a better option for a few weeks.",

There is absolutely nothing to worry about, if you have affected lymph nodes they will ensure your chemo treatments are geared towards that.  Please do not worry.   I had a down week last week but am back up and running again this week.  I have 3 lovely kids and my youngest who is 21/2 is so cute, she is always reminding me why I need to soldier on.

Me too.  I am 5ft 1in, weighed 8st 2lb and worked out (weight training and quite seriously) 4 or 5 times a week depending upon commitments, never ever smoked in my life, drink only moderately and am a big believer in eating healthily (most of the time!) but it got me too.  I have been too tired to work out since August last year and now weigh 9st which I am not happy about.  Muscle is being replaced with fat and none of my clothes fit properly anymore. cancer is not picky.  I personally do not believe that it is just down to diet and lifestyle.  I believe stress plays a big factor in triggering the cancer cells.  Maybe it was the same for you too.  Working, running, being a parent etc etc etc. Maybe demanding too much of your body.   It all takes its toll eventually. Take what you need to get through this but don't let it stop you leading your life.  You will look back in a few months and be furious at the time that has been lost if you do.

      "Content": "Oh Flower20, what a journey you are on - you have not even got a destination sorted yet which is why you feel lost. Unfortunately, I have to be honest and say 'yes' they may feel there is reason to believe it has spread which is why they are wanting to do the bone and CT scans.  I had them too for that reason.  However, they do so because they need to know if they are treating the cancer correctly so you have a better chance of being cancer-free at the end of it.  My onc told me I can choose not to have the scans and hope that if it has the chemo will kill it off anyway.  however, I said that I had children and that would be very irresponsible of me not to know and not to ensure that I received the appropriate treatment so I went ahead. IF they do find anything and it is an 'IF', they will adjust your treatment accordingly to ensure you get the BEST treatment. As for curable.  They cannot really say that with Cancer at any time.  We all know there is no CURE for cancer yet as Cancer comes in many forms.  It can affect absolutely any part of the body and in many different guises so it is incredibly difficult to cure.  HOWEVER, breast cancer is one of the most easily treatable and gets very good long term results with many women living an additional 10 years+ and some have been known to live 30+ years with no re-occurrence (even with the old treatments). It seems like just when one hurdle has been reduced for you to climb over it, you create another one for yourself.  Don't make yourself worse by fretting over things that may not even happen.  Having cancer is a big enough deal and you seemed to have coped with the news yesterday very well. I personally feel you have a very good diagnosis and there is little to wonder about.  Everything you have has been treated in thousands of other women who are now getting on with their lives cancer-free.  I have a friend whose daughter had leukemia at 4 years old.  that is pretty scary as leukemia travels and lives in the blood so it can go anywhere!  Her daughter is now 24 yrs old and has had no reoccurrence and is healthy and happy.  Please do not fret.  be strong, take it in your stride and deal with this little b*****d head on - it really is the only way.  Look how big and strong you are and how small this cancer is.  Dont feed it with you fear - it just makes it appear bigger and more important than it actually is. All words easily said I know - but you will find yourself fretting all the way through otherwise.  Every time you go for a test you will be fearing the worst and it makes your whole life a misery. We are all here for you Flower20 but only you can take the necessary steps forward in your own journey. Please please please try not to worry.  Worry makes you stressed and affects your immune system and that's how this little parasite got in, in the first place, looking for a weakness to latch onto and feed off.  You really are more in control of how you get through this than you may think.  Being fully informed is the first step - do not fear the results, whatever they are, they give you more power to get through this.",

Its great to have a laugh at the stupid stuff but also nice to smile at the nice (occasional it seems) stuff that people do too, so here is mine. I was offiicially diagnosed on 30 november last year and am a self employed single parent.  I had been unable to work full hours for most of november due to feeling so tired (hence the initial visit to the GP mid november) but by the time I got the news, as with all of us, my head was reeling from the shock and work just disappeared as I struggled to cope with the reality and try and deal with finances.  once I realised that I could not pay all of my nursery fees for my 2 year old (who was in full time then at a monthly cost of £740) for december, I paid £450 that I could afford and notified the nursery that I was unable to give the usual 4 week period notice and pay for it (and told them of my cancer diagnosis) but if they could at least let her attend sessions to the value of my payment and reduce her attendance thereafter until I was through my treatment I would appreciate it and I would try and pay the outstanding amount over the coming couple of months.  Expecting them to be harsh as had been my experience with some nurseries in the past (they always seem to disinterested - the management anyway), I got a shock but a nice one. The Owner of the nursery called me and said 'dont worry - just bring her in as usual this month and we will forget the additional payment and start the reduced attendance from january as per your request.  Please just think of it as our christmas pressie to you and don't get stressed'.  I ended up in tears over the phone which is most unlike the hard, get on with it me. Last month (february), they started offering me a couple of half day additional sessions if I wanted them, and thinking I could do with the time to get some work done or have a rest I took them up on it and paid (with a struggle).  however they then contacted me yet again and said 'no no, the sessions are for free.  We don't have a full quota for that session and it costs us nothing so please don't pay we will take what you have paid off next months bill'  Yet another surprise!! Then yesterday, I had my second fec-100 and felt absolutely dreadful.  My legs felt weak and I felt headachy and nauseous for the first time.  I phoned saying I could not come and get her but would it be ok if my 8 and 10 year old came with the pushchair as I had no other alternative (it is literally 5 mins round the corner).  Pam, the owner, said no don't panic, I will bring her home for you and if you ever have days like this again and either need her collecting for nursery or bringing home, please just ask because you need the rest. So, there ARE good and decent people out there........ I also have to add that I have met some of the nicest people in my chemo unit and oncology waiting room these last 3 months.  People I would never have met otherwise and it does make you realise that not everyone out there is an arrogant so-and-so.  Just one good experience can make all the difference.",

I usually wash my face with the black soap but I also make my own face wash out of liquid Castile Soap, essential oils and rosewater. I am also encouraging my kids to be aware of the chemicals in these everyday items and have replaced my kids shampoos with 'good' ones too.

Also harmful to fish and other wildlife. Surprisingly, even products marked \u2018unscented\u2019 or \u2018unperfumed\u2019 can contain fragrance along with a masking agent which acts as a block to the receptors in our brain which recognise odours.   So really, sometimes, perfumes are present but simply masked. There is so much that is hidden from us.  I dont just use paraben free etc products,  I tend to go for those with just natural products.  I particularly do like Shea Butter products.  Also making these products are really easy.  It is just a case of mixing them together most of the time.",

Anyway, Shea By Nature are a good brand to go for.  No nasties in their stuff. If you want to soften your scar, you could also try pure rosehip oil which is also available on amazon for about £6 for 100ml which will last you forever!  Make sure you get a cold pressed one though - The Aromatherapy Shop do a good quality cold pressed one.

I also occasionally use my home made shea butter, coconut oil and pure vanilla extract concoction which is oilier but really softening (the vanilla does help with the smell and once on your skin the shea butter smell evaporates and you get a nice vanilla wiff left). I like the black soap because it is shea butter based and non drying and shea by nature do some nice liquid black soaps for the shower. (hey I bet I earn more commission than you!! :-) LOL)",

      "Content": "Hi Lady Muck, May I say, that even if you eat meat which has not been treated with Growth Hormones, you are still ingested the animals natural hormones from the meat itself.  If you are hormone positive for Cancer purposes this can only help add to the level of hormones in your system and create an imbalance.  Together with the chemical absorbed by our bodies from cosmetics and the environment (some of which cannot be avoided), this does cause hormone imbalances.    As far as I am concerned, anything I can do to reduce my hormone levels to something near normal, is better than nothing and that means avoiding meat, using body products that as are natural as possible (though you have to be realistic and realise that as chemicals have been polluting the environment for years even those natural shea butters etc may have unnatural things in them too but hopefully to a lesser extent) and drinking plenty of water (not teas and coffees etc) as water is the one thing the body needs to perform everything it does from breathing to cell health. May I ask what the ingredients are in any feeds that you use for your farming?  I am not an expert but I gather that although growth hormones are not used necessarily, there are certain ingredients used to boost the pigs (and other cattle) hormone health to provide a good foundation to their reproductive potential.  Does this not increase the level of hormones in the meat?  I would not like to take the chance as I am one of those that is hormone receptor positive.   Trust me, although I have never been a big beef fan, I was never a picket line veggie until I got Cancer but now I do avoid dairy products and meat, although I call myself a Vegetarian with a small 'v' as I occasionally enjoy a piece of fish (and yes I realise  that the water may also be contaminated by estrogens etc but its not very often at all that I succumb).",

I have an engineering background but not a biological one so I do not know if that answers your question as to scientific or not. From what I gather (and I did also say in mypost that I am not an expert, therefore I asked you what you used) that animal feeds DO contain certain things which are intended to promote hormone health for various reasons: \"Sow productivity in the UK is increasing dramatically with the introduction of new and superior genetic lines such as the Hampshire and Pietrain. Many herds are now producing 28 pigs per sow per year - the so-called \u2018hyper-prolific\u2019 sows. In order to maintain this level of performance correct feeding of the modern sow is vital. Generation Programmed Nutrition is aimed at feeding the next generation of piglets through \u2018foetal imprinting\u2019. This helps to re-programme embryonic development to ensure enhanced metabolic competency of the piglet at birth.  Doing so provides the piglet with the best possible start in life, ensuring that not only is it heavier and more vigorous at birth, but subsequently exhibits increased performance during the growing and finisher stages, generating a substantial economic advantage.\" From a laypersons point of view, if we take a vitamin pill or eat a nutrient rich food, we absorb those vitamins or nutrients into our blood which then go on to feed other cells in our bodies inlcuding muscles, or other tissue.  Does it not therefore follow that if you consume meat, which will by its very nature contain hormones just as our muscle tissue does, you will also be ingesting the nutrients AND the hormones which will then be synthesised by our own bodies? Thats not looking at it from a scientific point but merely a logical one.  And there has been substantial research and studies that have shown that dairy products and animal products do have an effect on our hormone levels including estrogen which in turn have an effect on hormone receptor positive cancers.  I, for one, would like to avoid the things I can to reduce this possibility as there are plenty of things in the environment that I cannot avoid which are also bad for me. Water is another topic altogether.  Tap water has been known to contain levels of estrogen which cannot be removed through the filtering process and although not harmful to most people they do have the potential to increase hormone levels in the individual.  Bottled water can also be a problem depending upon whether its in glass or plastic bottles or whether its simply table water or mineral water/spring water. So, yes, where do you draw the line?  But doing something is better than doing nothing.",

      "Content": "Hi keyfeatures, I totally agree.  Having looked into oestrogen and how to reduce it, it seems I can remove meat (injected with high doses of growth hormones) from my diet, go organic, reduce the chemicals I put on my skin (which is the main reason I go paraben and SLS free as these chemicals affect our hormone balance).  However, there is oestrogen present in the water supply (leftovers from urination of women taking the pill etc), and yes there are chemicals in others things I cannot avoid but reducing the intake of these has got to be better than nothing and as I said, for me it is not about reducing cancer by reducing parabens,  I am ER+ and I aim to reduce my oestrogen levels to reduce the risk of cancer. Having said that, we should not underestimate the impact of our small but seemingly insignificant changes.  If more people go natural or refuse to buy these items, industries will change (hopefully) their use of these chemicals.  It may be small and slow but from acorns mighty oaks and all that.  The green movement is probably larger now than it was back in the 70s when for me, it seemed to be at its most prominent.  More people are aware of what is happening both to the individual and overall to society and quite a few are trying to make changes. Parabens do not in themselves cause cancer, but they a part of a chain of events which are one or two causes of cancer.  I feel better making an effort to go more natural and it saves me money and I have to say, my skin feels better for it too.  AND there is the added benefit of the psychological effect.  The mind is a very powerful motivator and if you feel unwell you can make yourself physically unwell but if you feel like what you are doing may be helping you, perhaps it is.  Cortisone levels affected by stress have also been linked to cancer so positivity has got to help in some way, no?",

In fact, it made that particular breast too large for my bra cup.   It is now 6cm x 5cm and hopefully will continue to shrink before surgery.   I know it seems alarming but no matter how big it is, it will be treated and a few days here or there should not make a difference.  Please do not stress and stay positive Your waiting time does seem excessive though and I had an MRI and CT scans and was never asked about my menstrual cycle.  Results were given within 48 hours.  Postcode lottery again I guess.  In fact, I was diagnosed on wednesday and by the following week was having my scans, also an ECG and the results of my bloods.  Within a fortnight, i had received all of my results (which were pretty good as far as cancer can be good) and first chemo was 10 days later. you should be just about getting ready for your surgery now I guess.  Hope it all goes well, I still have 4 months to wait for mine. Don't stress, cancer loves stress - they work hand in hand.",

I too am self employed and just like you I worked like a donkey last year and thought the tiredness was all part of being self employed, a workaholic and a single parent.  but I am a big believer that this disease feeds on people like us, who push ourselves too much and weaken our immunity so don't let it creep into your life again. However, do have a good blub then look at yourself in the mirror and laugh damn hard at what you see.  The tears will release some toxins and the laughter will help heal.  We can't be strong and unbeatable all of the time and when you do hit the bottom, the only way is up!  (OOoo I feel a song from the 80s coming on there! :-) ). Seriously Sue, let it out then take a deep breath.   Look back at the journey you have already taken and be proud of yourself and look forward and the much shorter journey you have to take before you get your full life back and take some strength from that. Lots of Hugs X",

So good on you for being so positive. Well done for giving up smoking too!

My pain was mainly in my back and hips and knees and my hands developed 'dropsy' where although I did not realise it, I was not holding things properly and consequently things fell to the floor with ease.  Very frustrating. Don't suffer any kind of pain - tell your onc, they have something for everything!",

      "Content": "Hi buddy101, I had LD Flap recon 7 weeks ago.  I would not say I am 'sporty' but I did used to do weight training (free weights), kettlebells, swimming and kickboxing regularly (at least 4 times a week though mainly the weight training) prior to being diagnosed.  I have just started doing some exercise again, this time I have started with some pilates and light weights and I have not noticed any significant problems apart from a tightness in the back.  The pilates seems to actually help with reducing the tightness and stiffness in the back and shoulder and has also helped my cording that I developed.  This is obviously due to the stretching involved.  I found it much more interesting to do than the standard exercises. I dont play tennis (I used to play badminton but have not done so for years) but my surgeon did say that golf and tennis may be hindered by the LD Flap recon due to the swinging nature which involved the back muscles. It really depends how 'sporty' you are.  If you are talking competitive sports or serious stuff then it might be a problem but just general stuff I don't see much different to myself.  I am even lugging boxes around at the moment due to an impending house move and while I notice that my arms aren't as strong as they used to be due to lack of proper exercise for months, my back is not posing a major problem.",

Adding cumin and rosemary to your cooking where possible helps too.  both Jamesy and myself took many supplements throughout chemo including spirulina which is excellent for the immune system. read the thread anyway, see if you get anything from it.",

Luckily I never had my chemo delayed and it is now finished but I can imagine how you feel because I prayed every time I had my bloods taken that I would be ok and no delays.  I remember thinking at the beginning 'what a long time' it was going to be before my chemo finished and even half way gthrough, I thought 'what a long time' but now it all over I cannot  believe how quickly the time has gone by.  One week is nothing.  Think of it as an investment.  You are investing one week now of your life for another 10 years in the future!  Seems like a damn good return to me.  It is only an inconvenience.Nothing more.   There has been some research that shows that negative thinking during chemo can reduce its efficacy by up to 30% so stay positive!! I used to work out 4-5 times a week for an hour weight training. I have recently begun exercising again and I struggle to manage 15 mins but I know its only temporary.  You have to think that way too.  Nothing of what you are going through now is permanent so dont let it get you down.  Delays are annoying but it does not mean that you will not reach your destination. Hey my head is fluffy and I want so much to go out wigless but I think I may scare a few people so I don't but I can see the life coming back.  You need to keep going so you too can see the vitality return.  Chemo kills everything and that makes you negative but keep goign and you will have your reward. Stay positive Jamesy.  Thats why the bloods are taken to make sure your body is ready for the next onslought.  It is better to wait a week and have the strength to deal with it than not.

You could also look into: The Gerson Therapy. Most of the above look at extreme diets except the first but all of them seem to advocate a lower protein content or vegetarian based diet. Certainly avoid sugars and white carbs as much as possible as sugars 'feed' actual cancer cells and potentially activate potential cancer cells into the development stage. Hope this helps.",

      "Content": "Hi, A few things I did which may have helped as I never suffered particularly badly from the chemo (or maybe I was just lucky!) was: Always ensure you have a light meal before going to the chemo treatment.  Once I did it on an empty stomach purely because the appointment started in the morning for the picc insertion and continued through lunch into the afternoon.  I suffered that week. I always took 2 or 3 small bottles of water with me to drink throughout the chemo treatment. Drank at least a 2 litre bottle of water every day for at least a week after the chemo treatment. Make sure when you need to rest, you rest!  Don't put it off.  Feet up and rest, housework or whatever can wait a couple of hours. If you feel headachey or dizzy within hours of the chemo treatment take paracetamol asap, for me it helped to prevent the aches getting unbearable. I would also ask for a bottle of Difflam or similar mouthwash as almost everybody gets a sore mouth to some degree and it can prevent you enjoying or even eating food if it gets too bad.  Ask for this in advance before you leave the treatment room! Make a note of EVERYTHING you suffer or feel after your first cycle.  Any aches, pains etc however insignificant you think they are and NEVER but NEVER hesitate in telling your oncologist that you need pain relief etc.   There is absolutely no need to suffer through the subsequent ones and they do have various pain relievers available for aching joints, nausea etc.  Insist upon them if you really suffered the first time.  If you don't, the remaining cycles will really get you down.  Your body is being poisoned so of course it will react but there is no need to suffer and think it is only a few days I can do it, I am a hero!   Eat little and often and usually lighter meals.  Constipation can be a literal pain for the first few days but can be eased with small regular meals with - yes you guessed it - plenty of fibre.  I found myself becoming particularly fond of pink grapefruit! Hope some of this helps.  If I think of any more I will post. Good luck tomorrow you two.  The time will come and go quicker than you think.  I started my chemo on 22nd Dec last year and thought that the next 5 months would drag, but I don't know where they went!  I am half way through my treatment now, chemo over and surgery next.  I actually feel better than I did before I knew what was wrong with me last year, despite the chemo so I am looking forward to the end of this year. Just look after yourselves, dont overdo anything, you deserve to take a rest while this is happening. XXX",
