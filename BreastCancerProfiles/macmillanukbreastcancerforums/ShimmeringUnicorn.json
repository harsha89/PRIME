      "Content": "Hi I am so glad that things are looking brighter today. By choice I didn't tell my family that I was going into hospital for surgery, my partner was away and one friend had to move into my home to look after my dog and parrot.  Hospital was in the next city so I only had one visit from a pal.  All my choice and unlike yourself, although I had my own room, day after surgery I had to be up and walking. The hospital is huge so I walked a lot. Even through the night as I couldn't lie down as fluid collected in my chest and walking took the slightest edge off my digestive acid  volcano pain...I had a gastrectomy. So yes, nights can seem very long. Fast forward to my pet sitter in hospital...minutes from my house, eventually diagnosed with TB and so in isolation. I had constant phonecalls with issues I 'had' to go and sort out...like he desperately needed tissues... no one had sorted his TV for hours.. he hadn't been given a meal as there was none left etc etc....all not really true ...he was just bored.  He had me go shopping  for so many food items n treats n stuff, drip by drip, but so often he could have opened his own shop : ) He isn't really social so there was no one else to go visit but ..really??? So you see.. you are doing really well and I do hope you make it to your son's carol service...fab for both of you. PS...stop feeling guilty...you need to be well for him and this time of year he is probably having a whale of a time and being spoiled. Good luck and take care",

      "Content": "Hi Scarlett, Can I just butt in and ask about the nature of the work that you do?  I am just wondering about making the most of any workplace resources, policy and provisions. For years I worked as what was laughably called a casual employee...the whole team were 'casual' and worked fulltime for years. It meant however, that we only got paid for the hours worked, so no holiday pay or sick pay. Eventually campaigning efforts paid off and our contracts were converted to ...Zero Hours ...this meant we didn't have to be offered any hours of work but were expected to accept all that we were offered....and this was an improvement : ) At least it meant we got the going rate per hour and average hours worked could be used to calculate entitlements. Is your workplace aware of your health situation? Are they supportive? Are they a large employer so they have room to maneuver or is it a small business? Sorry if this seams nosey...it just appears that you on your own are running very fast to just stand still...not even good for someone in robust health. It does look like you have explored this with your bank...did you do this in person, face to face or online...if they couldn't help did they have any suggestions? I better stop as this sounds like an interrogation. Hope you find a less stressful way through the coming weeks, good luck, take care",

Good luck and take care. Hi to Kirsti... sheesh..your nerve is being tested..although absence due to sickness can't really be avoided, knowing that,  doesn't make the extra wait any less frustrating and worrisome. It does sound like you might have to 'argue' for your preferred option. I am sure you have thought very carefully about your decision but it might help to show that you are making an informed choice rather than wanting drastic action due to worry. So for example, you could ask your \"expert' to reiterate the evidence for, and benefits of, their proposal....meanwhile I would have done a quick bit of research so I knew what was going to be said and could then calmly explain that yes, I gave that a lot of thought but in MY situation, I feel that.,..bla blaa...whether it is reduced chance of further problems...or fewer possible surgeries or greater peace of mind...or whatever.  I always think it helps to show that you have given the same amount of time and thought weighing up benefits and consequences of all options rather than championing one. Years of Trade Union negotiations : ) so I hope I don't sound patronising and school teacherish ...and I know that once we are in our appointments...we are not always as 'together' as we would hope. Hope you actually make your appointment, on time and not too stressed....and hope your 'bad week' doesn't sabotage it. Good luck and take care.",

Yes, I too worked in catering and hospitality for years (among or as well as other things).  Along with all the pitfalls of the inconsistency of work hours as the business fluctuates and the unsociable hours, in a probably low paid job,  I suppose some of the benefits are the possible savings on childcare (as shifts can be outside of partners day work) and the option to pick up extra shifts at busy times....but of course the run up to Christmas is usually boom time. I used to depend on working silly amounts of hours working days and evenings to afford Christmas : ) but you get to know all the words to all the Christmas songs that there have EVER been when you do 20+ works Christmas parties : ) Good luck with your next appointment where hopefully you get will get some idea of the sorts of things that HAVE to happen at the proposed times and where there might be a little wiggle room.

Well...inspired, I stopped dithering about re ordering my to do list and took the dog out. He was rescued as a tiny puppy from a horrendous life and now is mostly fab...except fireworks. Add in his intelligence and memory and dusk is associated with fireworks etc. Plus, around here, firework season is most of year.  Anyway his 'safe place' is the bingo...no he doesn't have his own dabber, their car park is mostly empty and surrounded by grass n trees n a big fence...he couldn't wait to get there... ...but nearby construction noise included pop pop popping so he bolted... I did get him to come back HURRAY but one very stressed doggy till home. I am annoyed kuz this is his refuge and the last time we were there, just days ago, some eejits set off two horrendously loud bangers....barely dusk and not associated with any cultural event!!! so he bolted then too and he is as fast as a whippet... which I think is in his genes : ) Anyway I feel rubbish n nose running like tap and can I request that as for weeks over Christmas etc I already did the returning lurgy, so please can I be excused another doze? Can I claim my outing as two sprints? Cheers",

      "Content": "Hi Well folks again no proper walk...had dog out briefly a couple times and did my usual hobby of going to buy electric!. Then went to hospital minutes away to make use of their heat and light in the restaurant while I sat and studied possible routes for Friday.  I definitely want a certificate in logistics although train prices are not even distant relatives of logic. Looks like as usual, its a crack of dawn coach then train then bus then taxi then turn around and same home. Getting on for a 19 hour round trip! So after a brief walk of dog again, I walked to dog sitters to give him the 'good' news about the times. He is a sweetie as although he is in his 70s and has chronic back pain, he says he will have my furry one the night before and keep him till the morning after I get back. This is as well as having his partner come stay...she has no hearing, or speech, uses sign language , has very limited vision, is diabetic and recently was in a coma from several strokes. So she needs physical assistance, cruelly one arm is affected and of course she uses hands to communicate, and although a marvel considering what she has been through, can be very demanding and insistent... in other words hard work. Her son moved himself, wife and young children in to her small house to look after her. He and his wife work opposite shifts at the same place so they are always 'on duty' and they and my dog sitter try and do as much as they can before waving the flag and saying 'can you take over again'. Well as you can see my late night kitchen wrangling has ground to halt with a cupper break  : ) Well done for everyone who got over the doorstep and those who thought they might...its a start. Oh yes, this being secret is fine but EVERYBODY should have someone with whom they don't have to be strong and can let it all out...outside of the family maybe....but we have to let the bleeeurgh out so that the YAY can get in!

Ooh but two pendant pieces are good... will do photo later. Afternoon me and pal went looking at houses as hers has to be sold due to hubby leaving. It has taken her a long time to be able to face this so hurray!. The first was too small...she has a fab bull midriff who has a suitably large cage which is his own space to sleep etc and there was absolutely no where this could be placed.. Second one was better in terms of room proportions, a spot for crate, a tiny garden  but there has obviously been a problem with water egress either from the roof or water tank above bedroom and landing.  The woman from estate agent showing us around claimed not to have noticed!. Odd woman...I expected someone in office clobber representing the estate agent but... and I am usually all for individualism... she was an old dear who had a strange woolly hat, bingo boots, two smears of 70s blue eye-shadow vaguely under her eyes etc. Pal also had a viewing of her place before we walked her mastiff. I had no coat and it was freezing but I went!. (Polished halo). Hopefully dogs limp clears up as he off to Crufts in the veterans class! Then visited my dog sitter pal where my man and minger pal were celebrating my birthday with bacon sandwiches. Excellent for a vegetarian! Did get some bio oil as gift...works on my gasectomy scar. Walked home, homemade soup and was falling asleep so went bed...and slept YAY! Well done to everyone who did and tomorrow's another day for those who didn't and very interesting re Jewellery quarter . Cheers",

Ooh fatigue...and hives....sheesh, I have Fibromyalgia which basically means you ate wrecked, major symptoms fatigue and pain, but....often it is a hive like sensation, electric ants in your skin that WON'T stop. Believe me I have tried everything and if calling the fire brigade or the FBI would have helped they would be on speed dial. I took to reading in the bath for hours simply because my hands couldn't leave the book to scratch...which didn't relieve anyway. But....the strangest thing worked like magic.. You can get a huge tub in 'cheap ' shops under names like Freeze, Ice etc...it is blue menthol gel...sounds quite contraindicative but the relief is sooooo good and as it's so cheap you can slap loads on.

Sssshhhh but my throat pain is now bearable but yesterday I did resort to huge tissue plugs up each nostril....yes there are probably lots of Health n Safety reasons why this is a bad idea but it literally was like two taps and sandpapering off the skin. Marginally better right now. Thanks for suggesting cleaning help but I would have needed to organise that before now. Those following the drama know I had to make an unplanned trip on Friday. Such adventures eat into my energy given Fibromyalgia but realistically the state of my house results from a culmination of factors. Unexpectedly, my man had to go south, so I moved into his place to look after the pets. You can imagine an unplanned move...and a move into a place that hadn't had the existing stuff moved out of it. Anyway health took an unexpected turn when I discovered I needed surgery for a tumour and subsequent recovery. Still doesn't really justify the state of place but hey ...good news my man is coming back up here... hurray... Hang on...at last minute the accommodation he though was sorted isn't happening. Unfortunately he couldn't simply move back into his old place with me as his health has deteriorated and his back means he can't really manage stairs. This place has a big step through front door, then lots of stairs as its first floor flat, and stairs between living room, kitchen, bathroom etc.  Initially he will have to come here whilst looking for somewhere more appropriate...and he will be here tomorrow.... aaaargh!  Need to get my act together. However...whatever gets done, gets done. Could have done without this lurgy though : ) Take care",

Well I had an unscheduled walk on thurs night...went shopping to large Tesco where there is also a little £shop n BnM etc. Surprisingly my man said he was coming. Siiiiigh! He is a physical wreck... he used to work in Outdoor Ed so mountaineering, canoeing etc etc and along with the wear and tear that gives bodies, he also fell off a mountain...roped up, so suffered big scale whiplash type injury which wrecked his back. He had an operation on his shoulder a year ago...apparently there was nothing holding it together and a loose piece of chipped bone in there. Anyway his back is giving him a lot of pain now and effects his mobility and balance...which messes with his alpha male thing and he was out of painkillers. Shopping??? Off we  set, two buses to get there and as we arrived I noticed that the lane of traffic that services the bus stops for return journey was CLOSED! He hobbled around shops and had, had enough before I even got to checkout. Then a lonnnnnng walk back into town to get final bus back...me pulling trolley full of grub. Gluttons for punishment, painkillers then took dog to beach today.  Looks empty but actually there were a lot of other dogs and their people out...the sun was even out and the early morning frost and chill breeze warmed up a few degrees. Once home I immediately went back to town to get all the stuff missed in the shop last night because...ahem let's just say usual routine interrupted : ) Did arrive back to my tea cooked and ready to serve. After which dog and man and eventually me lay about in stiff, broken heaps! Take care and to all not quite getting out, hope everyone's pics giving a little lift.",

Some have specific conditions for referral, some more general including stress and anxiety. Facilities vary depending on the participating venues and not all services may be accessible via the scheme but can include pools.  The schemes usually run for a number of weeks with hope that you will be motivated to continue afterwards. It may well be worth looking at gym or 'wellness centre' ordinary membership in your area....yes the Local Authority or ex LA centres as concessionary membership may open up a whole host of opportunities like dance, bowls etc  All this from me, laid on the sofa exhausted from sleeping all day!

      "Content": "Winky49 ... I don't have my specs with me so this could get interesting! Accommodating someone's needs is sadly open to interpretation as are phrases like 'reasonable adjustments'.... but the spirit of legislation and statutory regulations would imply that the accommodation dies not make the process of carrying out your duties more difficult (really??) or your working environment  to have inferior facilities to those generally on offer to other emoloyees.  As it is not uncommon for an office worker to work in a single employee room, that in itself would be difficult to challenge as unreasonable.  However, you did not request these changes to your working situation...nor I  am assuming agreed to them. Therefore they are changed imposed due to your health and which you as detrimental to the ease with which you can carry out your duties. Go you in making it as inconvenient for them as possible in having everyone and and everything come to you. I don't say this for devilment...it evidences how much more be f an effort is in involved in you being able to do your job...in other words  , how many times you would have go go retrieve info, contact folk, duplicate paperwork, etc. There are hard and soft issues here. By this I mean that some aspects are clearly covered within the parameters of regulations and some are not so easily defined but definitely need addressing. Can I also point out that temperature, air con etc cause ongoing problems in many places as its often difficult to get a situation acceptable to all in a room... personal preference, who HAS to sit near/under the unit. There are many things which make a workplace function that aren't identified ...sometimes they only become apparent when something  is changed, discontinued or banned. One example of this is the stream of 'chattet' in the workplace... yes this is the social glue that holds groups together (or not) but often is also the way everyone knows what's happening... it mesns there are no formal checks that everyone who needs to know something does know, no official means through which those affected by something that no one thought they needed to know can become aware of it, who is meeting whom and why and what happened, names and faces and how each role fits in to the wider organisation, whose workload is building up and who can help, who has knowledge and skills outside of their role and fills gaps and smooths bumps...and the famous 'knows where the bodies are buried' Part-time employees come up against this all the time as they start their shift with 'nothings happened'... even things that make it onto notice/message boards get wiped before everyone has seen them. You don't say what sort or size employer you have...they will have workplace policies...(not necessarily good ones) probably on line. Is there a Trade Union presence? Their policies are onion and do contact them...if you are not a member..for a small fee and short run in time ( can't get services instantly to deter folk simply joining when want help and their strength is in numbers and employees who give their time to advocate, campaign and represent etc)...mine of info and support and will have disability/welfare officer. If not...try local disability rights groups etc in your area...you have enough to do in managing your health so get help in challenging your employer. I suspect they have taken what they think is the easiest option in moving you rather than deal with the rest of the room. Don't make it easy. Cab I also say...forewarned is forearmed... this can get messy and they may wish to question your 'capability'...,sooo right now, compile lits of evidence that you are on it and they have recognised that... so any performance reviews etc, training plans or request or completed. . other meetings not about you or your work but where it has been relied on or would have shown if it not up to scratch, deadlines met or beaten. OK I will stop...hope there are some actual words as I cannot see : ) Good luck...take care",

So some folk have lost the opportunity to experience illness other than acute (usually short, obvious symptoms, diagnosed and mostly cured or run its course in couple of weeks) so chronic conditions (perhaps takes time to diagnose,  long-term and mostly not curable) or dramatic or traumatic scenarios are something to face suddenly and may not be within our often very small family units on a day to day basis. So some folk can't resist an 'in' ...an opportunity to relate something that for them needs mentioning...note for them...it is very much a one sided situation.  Some of these folk are exceptionally good at one sided and if it were in the Olympics we we would clear the medal board...as even if they are squarely and justifiably and unquestionably shown to be inappropriate...somehow they garner sympathy and outrage for themselves as the injured party as someone horribly wanted them to feel bad!!! OK I will stop while we all polish our halos  Err....lovely! Ahem! Cheers",

      "Content": "Hi LB68 You have no doubt heard the phrase 'its only the tension hiding you together'. So yes, its normal and common to have weird, fragile, down feelings after active treatment or surgery, sometimes many weeks layer when everything is going really well. Its as if you heave a sigh of relief and let all the walls down. Until now you have been getting on with the 'doing'  of it and only now have time to react. Counselling...sometimes we have to take what's on offer but in reality there are different types of counselling and you need to find a good match...just as it is perfectly acceptable to say the method of counselling g is OK but you and the first choice of counsellor ate not a good match. That is no reflection on either of you and part of the integrity of a profesdional counselling service. It is a shame you feel you ended up 'just chatting'.  Sometimes a chat is exactly what we need but that wasn't the counsellors remit and if a conversational style was part of their format, it failed to make the objectives clear to you. In these days of austerity, budgets and evidence, what is on offer is usually six sessions of a particular therapy. On this one hand this is good as it provides a framework and structure and all know  is on offer.  I see it however as a bit like offering size 6 shoes to those with bare feet. Great if 6 is what you need but... You don't say how you accessed the telephone counselling. If you are an employ of a reasonably sized organisation or a local authority etc, counselling may be a service offered to staff. If you are a member of a Trade Union check out what they can offer too...their policies will be on line..Unison has a Welfare Officer. You can also try via your GP, your local branch of Mind the mental health charity or if you have a MacMillan or Maggie's centre near you. Breast Cance rCare offer moving forward courses etc  Don't be hard on yourself. take care",
