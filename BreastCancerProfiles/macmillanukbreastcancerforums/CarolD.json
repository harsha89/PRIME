      "Content": "Hi JBert, Of course I don't mind you asking about how many Chemos.  I was scheduled to have 6 cycles of TAC but, because the Cancer came back along the scar line, the last one was cancelled and radiotherapy and Herceptin were brought forward and the amount and intensity of radiotherapy was increased. Treatment wasn't too bad as I did not have many side effects.  I am now on vinorelbine and again, don't have many side effects.  The biggest problem I have is feeling tired all the time. Hope all goes well for you. Carol",

      "Content": "Hi Jbert, I have just finished the 18 cycles of Herceptin.  Unfortunately, I now have secondary cancer so am continuing the treatment. The first session was held in the hospital and took all day.  The actual infusion took about 1.5 hours, but they have to monitor you for the first time.  it was a very long day. Since then, I have been very lucky in that the treatment was administered at home with the nurse coming to the house and then doing the infusion.  I don't really get any side effects although I do feel rather tired the next day. Hope your treatment goes well. Best regards Carold",

      "Content": "Hi, I am now in my fourth year following my diagnosis and have continuously been on treatment on one type or another, TAC, Herceptin, Vineralbine, Capcitebine and soon to have weekly Chemo and Pamidronate.  About a year ago, I had a portacath fitted and, apart from the nurses sometimes finding it difficult to access, have had no problems with it and would recommend it to anyone.  It is not noticable to the outside world, doesn't hurt and only get a tiny bit of pain when the needle is inserted, but no different from having your veins used.  After one visit to the Chemo Day Unit for Herceptin and them having 7 attempts, I would not be without my portacath. Hope this helps Carol",
