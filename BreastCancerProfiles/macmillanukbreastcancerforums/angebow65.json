      "Content": "Hi all just me again. On Tuesday I had my pre rads appointment during which I had a ct scan. Prior to this appointment, my treatment plan was 15 rads and 5 years of letrizole. My oncologist came into scan and spoke to nurses and then I presume he went and watched the scan results as they came through as they all went into their room as the scan was done. The nurse came to me after the scan and gave me a new list of appointments and went on to tell me that my onc wants me to have a booster. This booster is adding 9 more rads to my original plan and then, when I saw my onc afterwards, he informed me that he was changing my plan of letrizole to tamoxifen for 2 years then a change of tablets. I feel stupid now because I was too scared to ask why so many boosters, not too scared to ask but scared about what answer he would of given me. When I asked when I should starting taking the tamoxifen, he just said, when you are ready, as long as its 3 weeks after your last chemo. He wants me on tamoxifen because its better for my bones than the letrozole as they can thin them. What do you think? I think this new plan is quite major , compared to my original plan. Any idea why this should happen ? Do any of you think he could of seen something on my ct scan ? Thanks all of you, Lots of love to you all Ange XX",

      "Content": " hi hawkster. I was diagnosed on 6th may this year,  through a trial of younger women. My mammogram showed up as positive in left side and consultant found something strange in right side. Bothvdiagnosed as cancer. I went into a mode where it wasn't me, it was someone else. From that moment I was scared. I have got through operation which I was petrified of. I had lumpectomy and had a wonderful experience of being in hospital. Its a real emotional roller coaster and this could tire you out. Any bad vibes that come in, push them away and let only positive thoughts wander through your mind. I canvt believe how strong I ve become!  I ve always been scared of chemo word let alone having it on a plate in front of me.everything about this scared me ! Now I m realizing how strong I am. Every step of the way, I was scared. Face it head on. There s a saying about 'do something scary, every day of your life, this is sort of like that.   I now face starting chemo on 21st july and my attitude is, lets get on with it, sooner started, sooner finished! Whatever happens, it is going to be a small part of your life compared to the rest of your life thats ahead of you. Appointments are not so good for me, I go quiet a couple of days before and for a couple of days after until it all sinks in. I also get very tired because of the emotional journey, if you are tired, then sleep.  When you go there, there is always someone worse off than you, there are children too. I even now feel so lucky, lucky that its been found, lucky that there is hope.lucky to have such support on this site, the people here are fabulous and deseverve medals. Come here with any anxieties and worries and they are there to help you through.  I wish you well and hope you come back here and remember that what you come on here for, helps someone in the future.good luck honey . Love and big gentle hugs Take care  Ange xx",

Strange , how when you go through the crap days, its hard to see any light at the end and you feel like its going to last forever. I do appreciate that so many of you are going through alot worse and my heart goes out to you all ! Now I know whats going to happen next time. !  BUT constipation folks! Haven t been able to go properly since thursday and not at all since saturday, is it safe to take lactulose, any idea? I ve drank loads of fluids and eaten lots of fruit but I felt like I was giving birth this morning and eventually went after being sat on toilet for an hour. Such a relief in the end!  Another thing is, Domperidone. I ve been taking it regularly since thursday and not had sickness, only waves of it coming over me. Can I stop taking these now and test the waters?   Thank you for your support Love to everyone Ange xx",

I finished all my treatment on January 6th this year and alls pretty good apart from tiredness and aches , I think from tamoxifen.  But OMG my hair, yes, thank god its growing! At the minute , in some places its about 2cm but its very uneven. The grey doesnt bother me at all ! I m wondering what to do with it as it wont style at all even with gel. Debating on getting it graded but not wanting it to come back thick. Will getting it all graded to the same length make it grow thicker? I dont want it to be thick! What did you do ? How soon after it growing did you get a haircut? I hate it at the minute. Really missing my bald head! No styling needed and it was so relaxing to run my hands over it, I loved it ! But now, its just there and depressing !  Love to all Ange xx",

      "Content": "Hi Sam. 1 word you used in your first post- scared ! We have all been scared at every point of diagnosis and treatment and beyond. Its understandable. I was scared of going for 1st mammogram in April, I was scared of hoing for results and I was petrified of 'chemo' even being mentioned.  I am now heading into my 4th chemo on thursday. I m still here !  Maybe not as scared, just a bit anxious every 3 weeks when it comes around again. Last operation I had was when I was 6 years old and apart from childbirth, I d never been in hospital. I am 50 now and I was soo scared of having the op BUT I got through it. I Looked at it in the beginning as a sort of adventure, not everybody, thank god, has to go through.  I hit it all head on and even did deals with hubby to have nights when the cancer word was not to be used and we used to put it out of our minds for an odd night. That was quite a task ! But we did it.  I had lymph removal on both sides, 3 from 1 side and 6 on the other. It does take quite a while to recoverbut do as they say and chill, take it easy . My nurse told me off for hoovering within the first week, I learned to do as she said. You will be sore gor a while if you need it doing BUT you will recover from it. I found the op a strange event because I felt so good after it for some strange reason and now, I d have no qualms about having another one, if ever needed. People on here are worth their weight in gold in answering any questions or worries that you have or even to help you through any tough times Good luck tomorrow, tuesday, hope all goes well.

We ge got 2 horses which we drive up to feed every day. This time last year, i could pull hay bin up the field in 1 go, these days i give up. Have to have 3 or 4 breaks to get it up to the top. Its so frustrating!  Hubby has to take over with it. I just crave to feel better and this hair situ just isn t helping! A friend of mine who s also completed her treatment has dyed her hair with a semi permanent 'crazy color' dye and i ve got some but i think why bother when its got a mind of its own and is being sooo stubborn where styling is concerned. Debating whether or not to shave it all off again. But hey life goes on doesnt it ?  Love to all Ange xx",

      "Content": "Hi Sarah, I  was diagnosed in may, due to start chemo, then rads then letrozole. Same as you ER +. during discussion with oncologist last week, he told me that if I have a period when I start on tablets at the end of the year, then removal of ovaries or injections will have to be cosidered. This is because your cancer is ER+, this means your cancer is reliant on oestrogen to help it grow and the ovaries are where the main source of oestrogen is produced. So it makes sense that if oestrogen is still being produced by your ovaries then you are at risk of developing it again unless the source of oestrogen is taken away. For me, this would not be a problem as I am 50, but I understand if this option is distressing for you. Good luck honey, hope all works out for you. Take care Ange xx",

Just want to say thanks to you all for putting things into prospective last week after 3rd fec , hitting the bottom and was just feeling so crap.  At that time, we know in our heads that it will turn around but it seems like it goes on forever, 1 week seems like 3 months when you re in there. On Friday, I woke up, went to bathroom and cried with relief. I always get an epiphany moment when this happens and feel the full force of joie de vive. I love the world on these days! I love to smell the fresh air, feel the sun on my face and am very emotional, littlest things get me crying. I just love that day when it all turnsaround. Now, its upwards and onwards, ready for next one on 24th September. I joke prior to chemo with a good friend who I ve met on this site, that when we get apprehensive a couple of days before chemo, that we re going to run awaywith a tent, a case of wine and pitch up on a beach and listen to the waves all night. I m sure come the 22nd September, I ll be dreaming about that escape after this 3rd one !  So, thank you all for being there. I did it, I survived no.3!! Love hugs and strength to you all. Ange xx",

The word hope and where the o is, having the breast cancer ribbon.  A year ago I had lumpectomy on both sides and had 6 lymph nodes removed on right side because of a trace of cancer in 1st node and I had 3 lymph nodes removed on left side, so I am at risk of lymphodema. Now, would a professionally done tattoo on the inside of my wrist put me at risk of lymphodema?  Is it safe for me to have 1 done, if not on my wrist then on my ankle? What do you think?

The chance of being diagnosed in the future is in the hands of the gods so every single day I live in hope of it never returning. Pepsicat - because I have had 3 lymph nodes removed on left side and 6 removed on right side, my BCN and doctor have told me that I have to take care of my arms for the rest of my life because I am at risk of developing lymphoedema if I ever get an infection on either hand/arm. If I cut myself I have to treat it straight away and cover it to save infection starting. Thank you all for words and advise Love to all Ange xx",

While I was going through chemo and lashes fell out, I still was appling mascara and cursed everytime I poked myself in the eye with the brush! I m 5 months post treatment and most hair has grown back except under arm hair and although I ve got eyebrows, they dont need plucking but everything else is growing like wild fire! But now, doesnt it take ages to get showered or bathed and just get ready! I really miss being hair free and especially miss my bald head as my hair is driving me nuts, trying to train it again to stick down and omg the grey hairs! Just put a semi permanent dye on it and I still havent got used to it. Ahhhh! The joys. But yes, must admit, I love applying mascara now! Love to all Ange xx",

And they scare the life out of me! I m currently heading towards my 5th fec and then 1, just 1, left to go and then onto rads and letrizole. I m excited! But come new year my treatment will be behind me BUT I know I m not going to be be the same person who started out on this adventure in May when I was diagnosed. My hubby on day 5 after chemo expects me to be the same old Ange I was prior to May and I m no way near. People who haven t gone through this treatment just dont understand how tough it is, for gods sake, all those months of diagnosis and treatment, looking over our shoulders for the grim reaper . Is it because people dont understand how tough it is? For people to tell me that I m looking so well, I find it quite patronising and because I look well, they expect me to be acting normal when I know I m not especially in my brain, my mind, my thoughts.  Is it just going through it that makes you realuze what a life changing treatment, thought provoking adventure it is!   My hubby will expect me to be normal come January, he ll expect me to be jumping back into the old routines that I had, that I did every day and no matter how much I take time to try and explain,  I know it wont sink in. And its strange because its not sympathy I ll need, its not pity its just understanding of how hard it was and how my outlook on life will change and my prospectives on life.  There are not enough words to describe seriously how hard this journey is that ll make people understand it apart from the good people on this site who have endured it, survived it and experienced it.  Maybe I will net counselling after this! Its exciting but scary but a step into the unknown. Ange xx",

Just because you ve got cancer does not mean  that the smiling and the laughter has to stop honey ! I had to tell my 14 year old in May andI started the converstaion with , right tell me what you know about cancer.eventually, she said, people die from it. So I then went into a positive talk about how lots of people survive from it too and then let it out that I d got it but although its going to be hard going, that I TOO WILL survive and still be her nagging and presurising here to clean her bedroom in 20 or 30 years time. She cried, she cried like a baby in my arms and I hugged her and cried with her and hubby joined in too. Just promise to be open and include your children every step of the way. I have done this with my 14 year old and my 2 sons aged 29 and 27. They have all accepted it and are always phoning me. My eldest son has moved back in to help out as he also gets on with the 14 yr old and they are good together. This is going to help us enormously when I start my chemo on thursday.

Luckily for me only 1st one on both sides was positive. Is this armpit discomfort I m experiencing normal ? Will it ease ? Any ideas how else to cope with it ? Taking painkillers and ibruprofen but its just knocking the edge of it. The scars are not giving me any problem amazingly. Thought I d be in a right tangle after op but crazily, I ve felt pretty good apart from tiredness and this armpit discomfort. If I reach up for anything theres a real pulling pain there too and although theres no redness visible , there s obviously strange things going on under the skin, feels strange to touch almost numb but tingly. Will all this get better ? Thanks for reading and any advice is greatly appreciated. Sending love to all with your own struggles. X",

JJsailor, I wish you all the luck in the world and sending you huge gentle hugs. Bless you! I feel like I shouldnt be complaining about my little adventure when I read some of your problems, my heart goes out to you all ! I just feel so lucky. I was picked for a mammogram in our area, they re trying out a trial of younger women, thank god I was picked as the mammogram found 1 lump on my left side. While seeing the doctor and as he was examining me, very gently, he found an abnormality on the right side which turned out to be cancer as well, so thank god for his magic hands. I ve told him his hands are magic everytime I see him! Within a month I had my operation and although both sides are in early stages it had still spread to my first lymph node on both sides so imagine where I d be in 6 months or 3 years down the line while waiting for a usual mammogram appointment. So I got away with having a clear out of lymph nodes and just had 3 removed on both sides. I still wake up every morning and for a few seconds I think its a dream, then I move and realize that, yes it is happening, I then take my painkillers before I get up and go to the bathroom. I ve just got my fingers crossed for monday when I m back for my post op appointment,  I hope to god nothing else has come to light during my op. The waiting for appointments is horrible, the what ifs that always creep inside your head that you have to push away.thank you all once again for coming to my shout for advice. X",

The consultant and bcn said that this is 1 area where they have no answers as to whether cells have escaped or not. I m sure the chemo on offer is called adjuvant chemotherapy. Personally, I don t want to give this chance of growing anywhere else. A few weeks back I was scared of the biopsysies and the looming operation but I, we have done it and come through it. Then, I was petrified of them offering me chemo, it happened, I m still here! By christmas we ll be saying, god, we were petrified of this chemo and look at us now, we are still here, done it and recovering. Yes, its going to be hard but the chemo isn t going to kill us, if we dont take the bull by the horns, what could be inside of us, might ! I wish we lived near by each other and I would come and sit by you hold your hand and help you feel better by giving you support and encouagement but I can still do that with these words here, hopefully . Yes I m still scared about whats ahead but I m coming to terms with it, yes, crazy things make the tears stream but its normal. We are going through a life changing thing and have also been through that surgery which was not easy but we WILL get there.

Defo phone your bcn, she ll relueve your worries. I ve been told yhat because your nodes are affected they could of allowed some cancerous cells through into the rest of your body,  hence the reason for chemo.even just 1 node could of allowed the blighters into your system honey. I m going alongvthe chemo route because the last thing I want is 5,7,10 years down the line if something crops up elsewhere in my body  and they say its related to my breast cancer, I would never forgive myself. As you know, I m still on a parallel course to you with tamoxifen for 10 years even after chemo and radio therapy. I have wondered if my treatment plan is too drastic but I ge got alot of faith in my consultant and he s already proved to me how good he is. Even though my lump on right sidevwas grade 1 , it had already spread to the 1 sentinel lymph node, but I m classed as grade 3 because my other lump was that grade althoughbthat one hadn t spread - very strange things these cancer lumps!   I m now 26 days post op and although I have better days, not very often but today my armpits are really painful, my right one especially where the cancerous node was. Already told it will take what seems like an age. Just keep taking paracetamol to knock the edge off it. Ivwas wondering if it is because of the heat and sweating more !  Get on the phone honey to your bcn and explain whats happened and ask her to explain you r results to you. She ll be able to explain it all, you will be going round in circles if you don't.  Take care sweetheart, big hugs. Get back on here to everybody asap so we know you're ok.

During a trial where younger people were being called in . The lady doing my mammogram said, dont worry if you are called back it ll probably just be because they have no pics to compare these to. Within a week I WAS called back, me thinking it was just for more mammograms. Then she said theres an abnormality. Then the roller coaster began. A week later I was told by consultant it was cancer. On that same visit he examined me and found something 'strange' on the other side. Thst day , more tests and a week later confirmation that both sides were cancerous. My hubby was and still is a wreck. Within a month, I had my op for lump removal, there they tested lymph nodes and found the lump that consultant had found, had spread to 1st node. Had 3 rem8ved on both sides. I expected everything to happen much quicker and thouhht that by my birthday in mid july that it would all be over with. Er.... no chance! Probably finish chemo and radiotherapy by mid november and then got to go on tablets. So, it goingvto be drawn out BUT I will get through it. Hubby s brill, goes out and gets me fruit, cuts it up all ready for me and puts it in fridge to keep cool. He holds my hand at every appointment and tells me off for pushing myself too much.

Some of us feel like its happeningto someone else until every so often we re brought back into reality. Just remember, that although it s cancer which is life changing it doesnt mean that laughter has to stop. Continue to laugh over things together and continue to love each other. Xx",

      "Content": "Hi Angieknit, wondered many times how you were going on. I had last fec on 5th nov, like you. Now, I ve just started rads BUT I started on Tamoxifen on monday and I ve got the same oroblem with legs first thing in the morning. I m like a 70 year old woman hobbling out of bed! I ve found that not sitting down too much helps, always  after half hour I ll get up and walk around or make a cuppa stops legs from feeling like lead and stops this stiffness. But saying that it wont help your sensitive feet and toes. Hopefully someone who s had docetaxel will jump in and help. Good luck hun, hope you feel better soon. Love and hugs Ange xx",

      "Content": "Hi all. I finished treatment on 6th January and at the moment, I m trying to enjoy life again and the freedom from continuous appointments. But, theres always a but isn't there?  Apart from a horrible cough, having no where near as much energy , not sleeping well with horrid night sweats, I ve also got aches - the tamoxifen aches! Knees, ankles, fingers. God, there making me feel old although I am 50 but I m feeling like a 70 yr old,  . Has anyone tried cod liver oil capsules ? Are they safe to take with tamoxifen? Just trying to find a way of easing these aches. Been on tamoxifen since december. Any help, advice would be so appreciated. Want to enjoy life , enjoy being in and walking up fields to my horses, or even carry a hoover up stairs without it being a struggle, even walking up stairs without having to use the bannister to pull myself up. Thought after finishing treatment, life would be wonderful but it s turning out pretty crap at the minute.  Love to all Ange xx",
