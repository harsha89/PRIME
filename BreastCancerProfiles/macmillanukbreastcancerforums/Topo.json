      "Content": "Thank you for all your responses! For those of you that have had it, I'm wondering whether you could describe how it feels from an \"inside\" perspective ( i.e.not to the touch).  Also how long was it till you were allowed out of hospital, and how long you had to have the drains in? And how long did it take for you to be having a pretty normal day, i.e. driving, shopping, making beds, doing a bit of cleaning etc? Oh yes... And did you have sentinel node biopsy at the same time? Thanks again! ",

Did anyone who had Strattice have nipple sparing? Also - how did you come to accept the idea of a mastectomy, and keep the fear of the surgery itself and of having a breast that isn't yours under control? I am really struggling with this. Thanks again :-)",

Obviously with the week or so afterwards, it would be better if it wasn't so far from here. I will clearly need someone to look after me those first few days out. It''s difficult for my current partner to get even more time off (though may be possible), and my ex-husband is likely to be uncooperative. I anticipate renting an Air B&B place for that week, but presume the hospital treating me will not provide home service?",

The area seems to be too large to do lumpectomy, so the choices are as above (I don't want to be flat chested). I am leaning towards DIEP because of potential dangers of implants and need to have further surgery in future, but I don't have enough belly fat to fill the whole breast, and the surgeon has said I would need to have a second operation to \"fill in\" with fat from thighs etc. I really need to hear from women who have had experience of both procedures.
