    "Content": "Hi Lynne Im also having chemo after oncotype dx test. I was told by surgeon I was border line chemo but because I'm youngish (45) it could benefit me. You get a score out of 50 mine was 28, which came in the intermediate section albeit the top end so it was decided I would benefit from chemo. The scores are divided into 3 sections low/intermediate/ high. You also get graphs showing percentages of reoccurrence with or with out chemo. It sounds complicated but once explained makes sense. Good luck XxÂ ",
