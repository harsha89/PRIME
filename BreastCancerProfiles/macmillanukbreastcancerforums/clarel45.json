      "Content": "Hi Julie to start with I was fine but 6months down the line I was 3stone heavier.  Have chronic fatigue,bloated, painful joints hips especially. Hot flushes and terrible night sweats, low mood, get breathless really easily, no libido at all and bizarrely a really sore tongue.  I actually feel like my body has aged 20 years and barely recognise my self. Sorry to be the bearer of bad news and it might be different for you. Wishing you well with your treatment and recovery.  Clare",

Already feeling better but also nervous because I know my chances of it coming back are higher. Can anyone recommend a viable alternative to Tomoxifen.  Clare.",
