    "Content": "Hi Lin, This is my first ever post but I wanted to say thank you!  I was looking for information about Herceptin side effects and came across your thread.   I\u2019ve just had 9/18 injections last Thursday and have diarrhoea (thank goodness for predictive text!) for the first time.  I was wondering if the side effects are cumulative and your post has made me feel better......I am exactly the same for about 5-7 days after each injection.  I ache beyond all measure and have started taking paracetamol before bed as I wasn\u2019t sleeping due to the pain.   With regard to people\u2019s comments (and I know that they mean well!) it\u2019s really difficult because you do feel better than when you were having surgery, chemo or radiotherapy, but I want people to know that I am still struggling without sounding like a whingebag!  I\u2019m not even sure why I want people to know this really - I am not very good at pretending! It\u2019s a strange time and I am an impatient person!  I WANT my hair to grow more quickly, I WANT my energy levels to be back, I WANT to be how I was before and I want all this NOW!! As my wonderful Macmillan nurse said \u201cthis is your new norm (for now) and you need to learn to cope with it\u201d.  Comforting - I kinda stopped fighting it. I\u2019m curious as to how the Herceptin is going for you now? With thanks again, Claire x",
