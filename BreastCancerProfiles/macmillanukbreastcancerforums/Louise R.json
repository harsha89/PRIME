    "Content": "Hi Claire, Sorry that you find yourself on this board, but it sounds like you have had a good set of results so far in terms of no spread to lymph nodes, clear margins etc. this whole thing is such a horrid roller coaster and it is so incredibly difficult to get your head round without being put in the situation you find yourself in. I am in the exact same situation as you - I had a lumpectomy in October and my tumour was grade 2, strong hormone receptive with no lymph node involvement no vascular involvement and clear margins. My course of treatment decided at the mdt meeting was radiotherapy and hormone tablets (tamoxifen) for 5 years. However when I went to sign my consent form for radiotherapy, the registrar suddenly said I could choose to have chemo if I wanted to. This of course put me in a complete tailspin as I had my treatment plan set out in my head and was happy with it. so to be given a choice in something like chemo when at the moment I can't even decide what to make for dinner just seemed really horrific. Turns out the registrar shouldn't really have pushed the chemo side of things as a) it wasn't part of the already decided treatment plan and b) the percentage benefit for my statistics was only up to 1%, with of course no guarantee that I would be that 1%. Oh and then the registrar herself backtracked and said at the end of the discussion that it wouldn't be worth it for minimal potential benefit!!! However, even such a small difference in survival is something i had to seriously consider, so I ended up speaking to a few different medical folk - my, gp, my oncologist who was actually majorly angry at the registrar for even mentioning chemo, a second oncologist and my breast care nurse as I was absolutely terrified of making the wrong decision and then for it to come back and bite me on the arse so to speak a few years down the line. As the other ladies who have already responded have said, you don't want to not fully treat this, and you don't want to feel like you haven't done everything you can to prevent it returning. Also however you don't want to put yourself through something with no real benefit. All of the people i spoke to said however that the long term issues and potential problems that 5 months of chemo would bring me was not worth a potential up to 1% increase in 10 year survival statistically speaking. If I needed it, it would have been part of my treatment plan and not be given as a choice about it.their confidence in me not needing chemo was based on my set of results. it is so important therefore that you speak to as many medical experts as possible before making your decision, and be armed with as many facts on the benefits of chemo and if there really is enough benefit to adding it to your treatment. Find out exactly how much chemo would add to your survival prognosis. I think if I remember correctly, if its less than 3% then generally it is not factored into your treatment plan according to treatment guidelines. Feel free to pm me if you want to chat about anything and I hope you are ok Louise xx",
