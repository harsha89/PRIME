      "Content": "I need a bit of advice - on Tuesday I have my 5th annual oncology appointment after my lumpectomy for stage 3 breast cancer which was followed up by elective chemo and radiotherapy since 2009 I've been on tamoxifen and should finish in Feb 14. I have already had an underactive thyroid and was just getting my weight down when I was diagnosed in 2008, since the start with tamoxifen I have had hot flushes, night sweats sometimes and I have gained over 3 stone in weight which I have been struggling to keep down. I wanted another baby but due to having a 5 year old at the time I put my priority into keeping well for him and my husband. I feel like I am on the verge of getting my body back from the doctors and having my chance to get fit before I'm 50 - the idea that they will want me to stay on tamoxifen for another 5 years horrifies me - am I being selfish or have I done enough of what the doctor's suggest?",

      "Content": "Thanks Kate I spoke to one of the nurse advisors today and she's given me some links that give figures rather than the bit that was in the papers. The thought of doing 5 more years is not inspiring though the weight I've put on could be worked on at the moment but my knees and ankles are starting to ache with the load and I can't really afford to get any bigger as a side effect. I'd just like my body back because sometimes you can feel like the doctors have hijacked it!  ",

      "Content": "Had my appointment today all okay, the doctor did talk about 5 more years of tamoxifen but since my weight is up 5kg since last year and my risk factors aren't high we agreed that after my mammogram in January if all okay I will finish tamoxifen in Feb 14. The I have till my next oncology appointment in July to see if I can get the weight controlled off tamoxifen and then decide if I want to go back on. Compromise I can work with - love Guys Oncology dept.",
