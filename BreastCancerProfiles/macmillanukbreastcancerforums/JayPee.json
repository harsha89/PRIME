      "Content": "I did a search first and found two brands that are easily available. I'm not recommending them because what tastes ok for me might not taste ok for you, but there's Euthymol and Kingfisher. There are probably others, too. I plumped for Kingfisher. No reason, just thought I'd try that one first. If you do a search you'll see the different flavours, although all they had in my local supermarket were fennel or mint. The supermarket prices looked cheaper than the prices online, but I suppose that depends. The bicarb mouthwash is effective (for me) and dirt cheap. That's also helped with the hoarseness that started 2 hours after the chemo went in.  You might be able to get some free samples to try from local dentists. I didn't because I was just desperate to try anything ASAP. Shame chemo centres don't have free samples.",

      "Content": "Hello dollydaydream01, I had my first chemo (for prostate cancer) on 28th July. I'm on Docetaxel with steroids. The starting steroids were Dexamethasone and Ondansetron and Metoclopramide and after Day 4 it changed to Metoclopromide and Prednisolone. I don't know which one(s) mucked up my taste buds but everything tasted disgusting within a day and my mouth felt like I'd eaten cow dung most of the time up to a couple of days ago, at least, I'm guessing that's what cow dung tastes like. I've never actually done it :-). What I found helped was changing to a natural, non-foaming toothpaste. I bought fennel flavour without fluoride and could actually taste it. The flavour I picked was just because it was something I'd never had in a toothpast. I backed it up with Bicarb mouthwash 3 or 4 times a day - the alcohol free mouthwash I was told would be OK to use actually made things worse for me. Fresh pineapple helped cleanse my mouth and made food taste a bit better for a little while. I found having a little bit before meals was a good strategy. I also found that if I ate anything slightly sweet (like dried fruit, sweet and sour sauce, chocolate) that my mouth reacted badly, whereas savoury stuff wasn't so bad. Regular tea not only tasted terrible but left my mouth feeling tainted so I have stuck to herbal teas and I have Earl Grey if I really need caffeine (like when I first wake up). I also suck extra strong mints now and again. They help, but taint food in their own way. Water tasted horrible to me so I tried mixing with different juices. Stuff I thought would make it more palatable didn't (Lemon Barley, unsweetened Ribena) but I found mixing Pomegranate juice with fizzy water tasted good and left no bad aftertaste. It might be worth a try but we're all different.  I'm on the upward bit of my cycle now so things are improving a bit. I read about the change in taste that chemo can cause but didn't really appreciate how horrible it could be. It sounds like something so minor in the great scheme of things but affects so much. All the best Jim",
