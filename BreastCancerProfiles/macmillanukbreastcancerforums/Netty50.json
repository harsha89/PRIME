Keep busy til your appt take your mind off it. ( I know nothing will keep your mind off it but I feel I must say it lol ) Not long to wait now, Take care Netty x ",

Is it just for a scan or mammogram too? At least when you have it they will put your mind at rest there and then. Try not to think about it, keep busy with those kids lol. Give them extra home work so you can spend your evenings marking ! Seriously you'll be ok. Take care Netty xx",

Your age and family history probably mean it's nothing to worry about, but it would put your mind at rest wouldn't it? Go back to your GP and ask him to refer you. I'm doing ok thanks, mastectomy and  4/6 chemos done. Will be finished 11th feb with chemo then a bit of radiation and a year of herceptin.  Hopefully that will be the end of it ! Again good luck Netty50",
