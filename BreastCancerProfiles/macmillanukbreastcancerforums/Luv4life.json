      "Content": "Hi Michael, I watched both episodes last week on i-player and was so pleased to see how the producers had covered every part of the whole cancer process, I was diagnosed in July 2014 with Grade 3 breast cancer and experienced first hand the upheaval and chaos that it can cause, I was repeatedly hospitalised with infections throughout the chemotherapy treatments which has left longer term symptoms post treatment, luckily I have a wonderful family and my husband could not have done any more, and we are all working our way through it. It was a breath of fresh air to have cancer spoken about freely and openly. We have had so many people around us in the last 2 years affected by cancer, I think the figures may be higher than the 2.5 million stated, I think a lot of the increase is due to better screening and social awareness of checking yourself, but sadly there are still people dying so soon after diagnosis as they either did not recognise the symptoms or the symptoms were not acted upon, we have just losta close friend who was only diagnosed 4 months ago with prostrate cancer which had spread to his bones.... Programs like the Big C should hopefully take away the stigma of Cancer and help people to be able to discuss it more freely. Live life, Love life xxx",

      "Content": "Hi, I can totally empathise, when you are given the news, your brain seems to goes into slow motion and we lose the ability to retain information. I too have grade 3 breast cancer, and would wholeheartedly advise taking not only a notebook, but also a friend if you can.Â  The professionals tell people this everyday of the week and can sometimes forget the bombshell they are dropping on you, they also seem to give you the proposed treatment plan and want you to commit to it straight away. I wished that I had been aware enough to ask for time to think all the options through before committing myself without being aware of success rates and side effects, a few days is not going to hurt anyone really. Good luck with whatever you decide is your best option, there is a lot of support on here and also useful information :-) xxx",
