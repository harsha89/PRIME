      "Content": "Hi there bit of an embarrassing topic but I'm 32 and nearly at the end of treatment for HER2 and ER positive breast cancer. Last chemo 14th June, surgery 17th July, due radiotherapy 25th Sept. I'm on Herceptin, Zoladex and Tamoxifen. Since chemo/Zoladex not sure which one has caused it but I am very dry down below I've tried lubrication and I've tried Replens moisturiser. It's getting me down as it's stopping me being 'normal' again. It hurts when I have sex and especially with a condom seems to make it worse. Is there anything else I can do? The dryness seemed to be there before I started Tamoxifen and I guess Tamoxifen will only make it worse :-/ any advice appreciated xx",
