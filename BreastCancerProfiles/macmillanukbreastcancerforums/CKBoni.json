      "Content": "Hi, I have just been diagnosed with breast cancer. On Friday 20th Nov. I found out, via a cc in a letter to my GP that it was grade 2 invasive breast cancer with metastic carcinoma in the lymph node. I do not know what this is so I have googled it as I do not know what it means and do not have anybody to ask.  I feel let down that I was not told by my consultant on the day he told me I had cancer and broke down in tears today when I received another appointment for an MRI scan for the breast I thought was completely fine. Again no word from either the breast care nurse or my consultant on why I need this appointment. I will be receiving my results of the CT scan and bone scan tomorrow, I am trying to stay positive but it is slowly sliding as the evening draws to a close.",

      "Content": "Thanks for explaining and the advice Crystaljuju, I will be speaking to the breast care team this morning so I will ask that I be informed prior to the letters arriving on my doorstep.  To see it in writing made it a reality I was not prepared for. No they have not said it is invasive lobular but I will be asking this today when I get my results. Speak soon x",
