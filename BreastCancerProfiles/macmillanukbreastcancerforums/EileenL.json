    "Content": "Hi Kiera,its a scary time for you right now.I know exactly how you feel as i had the same diagnosis last year and have had mx chemo and radiotherapy.It is natural to be worried that the cancer might  have spread but trust in your doctors and especially the macmillan nurses. You willhave a designated breastnurse and you should be able to talk to her atanytime. she will give you all the information and answer any  questions you may have. I was lucky enough to have aMaggies at the hospital and fou d that they too were very reassuring as well as offeri g some good activities. once you start your treatment youwill meet some amazing people who's bravery and positive attitude is awesome.  you are not onyour own with this. i gave my cancer a name and treated it as the enemy which i was determined to defeat. try and take control and think positive. its not easy but you have somany people behind you working to get you better. all my love and best wishes Eileen x What Cancer cannot do. It cannot criple love It cannot shatter faith It cannot kill freindship It cannot destroy peace",
