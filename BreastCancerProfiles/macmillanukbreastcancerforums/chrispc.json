      "Content": "Hi - I've been on Anastrazole for 5 years and it does cause joint pain. I have pain in almost all my joints. However, Naproxen can be prescribed which really helps a lot, Unfortunately I have had to stop taking it as I have live disease and stomach lesions. It is essential it is taken with food but if you can get your gp or oncologist to prescribe it you will definitely notice the difference. Hope this helps.",

      "Content": "I think the 5 and 10 years will be the length of time you need to take medication to minimise the chance of recurrence or spread. Some oncologist prescribe for 5 years and others 10 years. There is no reason to think you will get a recurrence and the medication is a precaution as I understand it. You should have a specialist breast cancer nurse who can answer any questions you have. If you don't who it is just contact your breast clinic and they can put you in touch with her. Hope this helps a bit but do speak to Nurse to put your mind at rest.",

      "Content": "Hi - I have bone mets in my spine since 2013. Although it is incurable it is treatable and you can live many years with treatment. I am on anastrazole with 4 weekly infusions of ibandronate. There are some side effects including joint pain but these can be managed with medication. Hope this helps. I was really scared when first diagnosed and didn't expect to still be here now. I have 3 monthly scans amd so far have shown stable disease. They will find the right drugs for you so please don't worry.",
