I really couldn't walk at all for a few days and this cream worked well on the peeling. My toenails are still a mess and I'm going to go to a chiropodist in the new year. good luck, do hope it is better really soon, hugs xx ",

I think the most reassuring  thing is the speed and efficiency of the team around us when we do have a problem. So as the advice on here says, call your team if worried, listen to your body, drink LOADS of water, ginger tea is great also peppermint tea, I was told to line my tummy before chemo and exercise when you can, rest when you want. You will be fine. good luck xx",

I was on a lower dose anyway because of age, 70 at the time, so was doing 4 fec and 4 t, after the first t I really suffered with feet and hands, shards of skin coming off both and very much the feeling in the toenails as you describe. Onco reduced dose a little more and I went weekly for 9 weeks, much easier, still not a doddle but very much as the saying on here goes 'doable' my toe nails didn't turn black but I lost a few of them, no pain and the new ones came through very quickly and look ok, I finished chemo end of august 2016 my feet are still strange and I'm told might get better might not, they are sort of numb, a weird feeling but if they stay like this it's fine, I hope they will get better but if they don't it isn't a problem, just strange. good luck and by the way I now have a really good head of 'short hair' feeling good, have my tired days but on the whole feeling good. hugs, be kind to those feet, they work hard xx",

Do tell your team how much you are suffering, my team assured me that the treatment I was having was just as effective. Chin up girl, this too will pass, as they say. Good luck xx",

Dreamthief, as we all know is a legend, all of you champions are terrific, a huge thank you from me. For any new terrified members, I was diagnosed one year ago with breast cancer, had a mastectomy and all lymph nodes removed ( only one side) I had 4 FEC, 1 T, then 9 paclitaxel weekly, the T was a bit tough on me. 15 radiotherapy, 5/10 years Anastrozole. Not going to pretend it was a picnic but I got through it, I'm 71 so no spring chicken, I lost all my hair (didn't cold cap) lost all eye lashes and brows. I now have a really decent crew cut, I don't miss washing and styling my hair at all, might keep it really short and maybe a bit funky, I now have a full set of eye lashes, think they might be better than they were before and the eyebrows are back, a bit scraggy but that is over plucking not chemo, a curse from the 60's. I've been treated so well by all Doctors, nurses, everyone connected to my journey, I am so impressed with the cancer care and can't thank everyone enough. So to all of you starting on this unwanted journey, good luck, you will get through this,  I know some journeys are harder than others, I sincerely hope none of you have more than you can cope with.  Many many thanks to all on this sanity saving site. Health, happiness and Happy Christmas to you all ❤️️❤️️",

      "Content": "Hi Judy, my heart goes out to you, there are times when life just sucks, you are having more than your share of bad things, as we all know the waiting is just the worse part of all this, once we know we can get on with our plan. I did my screaming in the shower and went for walks,, watched tele and crochet a lot of beanies and scarves (not very well) I put on my positive head but had trouble with the fact that people believed me, good actress or what, I think it would be good to be able to meet up with other people going through similiar treatments they really are the only people who do understand, then you can moan, rant and usually end up having a laugh. I don't think anyone on here minds us having a good rant, so fill your boots.  Wishing you and your husband good news and very good luck xx",
