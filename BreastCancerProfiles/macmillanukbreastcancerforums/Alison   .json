      "Content": "Hi Traci.. having just joined the macmillan site this evening I was keen to speak to other people similar to myself, yours is the 1st post I have seen and replied to, (I must say its with a lump in my throat and a tear in my eye!) However Im now 48 and was diagnosed after finding a lump in my breast when I was 36, there are different types of breast cancer, mine was an encapsulated tumor (which felt a little like an almond) I can remember being in a total state of shock, fearing the very worst and feeling completely not in control! We all deal with things differently of course but at the time I found it much easier to be positive reassured and in control by researching the type of cancer I had along with the treatments that I was being given, asking every possible question I could  in order to have knowledgeable conversations with my oncologist, having as much formation as possible can make it easier cope. Traci if you are able to deal with this head on with a positive mental attitude it isnt such a battle. Thankfully you can have faith in your doctor to know exactly what treatment will be successful. I've just finished a course of chemo with very few side effects, unlike a previous treatment when I was 1st  diagnossed which was pretty gruelling but thankfully it works and dos'nt last forever! McMillan nurses are fantastic and can advise you on practical everyday help and support thats available to you. I do hope it gets a little more manageable for you every day and you find all of the support you need.. Very best wishes.",

      "Content": "i also was told a lot of different things  when i was diagnosed but i was lucky my surgeon covered all areas i ended up  having my lump out and 8 nodes out , the nodes thing actually scared me more than the lump to be honest . i had chemo and double radio as the lump was so close to my skin .  i was 42 and your right  people seem to be younger and younger getting  breast cancer.  i think your age is  to do with  getting the whole packaged it feels me with horror when people say   they were lucky they didnt have chemo. my mother had breast cancer  also didnt hve chemo just radio and hers came back  im sure thats why .i was very lucky i sailed through my chemo  and i wish the same for all you ladies  im now coming up for my first mamogram  which im finding  more frightening than all the other processes xxxxx",

      "Content": "My name is Alison I had a mastectomy a year ago, I felt I recovered quite quickly and went back to work in two months, I was lucky in that I only had DCI's and not full blown cancer. I had a back flat but looking back wish I had just gone for the implants only option. I have implants as well as a massive scar on my back which I was told today and which I already knew wouldn't get any better, It is very red and protruding, it looks very ugly. When I was first told I would need the operation I looked everything up on the internet as none of my friends had been in the same position as me so I had no one I knew to talk to. My first choice and gut feeling was to go with just the implants but was talked into the back flap by the nurse at the hospital. BIG MIstake for me anyway, I now have red scare tissue across my back and a big red diamond scare on the breast. I would like anyone with the same problem to contact me if they know of any way or have had any tattooing done to cover the scars.",
