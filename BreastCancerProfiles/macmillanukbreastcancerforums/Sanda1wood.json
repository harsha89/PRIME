      "Content": "Hi Mf  Just re-read your comment about your wig slipping off because you still had hair. I was warned by my lovely sympathetic wig supplier about this. She fitted my wig on and it felt great so I wore it home, through the city centre onto the train and through my home route. It was a windy day and to my horror when I looked in the mirror I had been wearing a wig hairband lol all my hairline was visible where it had slipped backwards. Back in the box it's gone.  I've already shown a colleague my monk look and got a very direct f'in hell! I picked her because she's straight. I look like an extra from the Walking Dead so Might have to perfect my zombie lurch and brave the bald in work. They're all bonkers anyway so will take it in their stride with their full support xx I had my first taxotere cycle today at a different hospital and it was such a positive experience. The nurse actually parted my hair to spray the roots. Instead of just spraying the surface like you'd spray polish so it never reached the roots. Then she applied conditioner which the other hospital never did. She agreed it was the cap fitting as my head is an awkward shape. She changed the size of the outer cap and enlisted the help of a male nurse to get it as tight as possible. She only started the machine when she was happy with the fit, and admitted that I wouldn't have lost my hair with the contact she achieved. It was so nice to be treated sympathetically.",

      "Content": "Thanks mf. Good luck with your reconstructive e surgery, I have 2 taxotere cycles left, last one should be march 8th. Then I ring the plastic surgeon to arrange reconstruction. the poor guy is so devastated that my DIEP reconstruction failed, that the breast care nurse said he'll be giving me the best treatment he can 9though I think he would do that anyway, he was more upset than me when it failed). there's a 6 month waiting list. I want to lose weight in the meantime. I had lots of loose skin on tummy and boobs last time I lost weight, so the back flap and breast reduction on the natural breast will hopefully get rid of loose skin too. i'm delighted with the tummy tuck, so this might all be a blessing in disguise eventually :) No radiotherapy, 18 Herceptin injections, letrozole for 7-10 years. but by the end of next year, 2 boobs, hopefully. I feel a bit like a patchwork quilt, and a zombie rolled into one, with all the body parts I'm harvesting for my breast, but i'm sure it'll result in a lovely work of art :) hope your reconstructive surgery gives you the result you want Xx hugs xx",

      "Content": "I just wanted to add my experience. I have lost most of my hair despite using the Paxman scalp cooling system. I'm not sure if it's because of the wrong cap size being used as it's on the crown and the nape area. I did have exceptionally thick hair and the bald patches are in a strip where my long part of my bob was brushed over my crown area. The treatment I got at the hospital wasn't the best. A nurse gave me a few sprays which would never have reached my scalp, then disappeared for ages so it would have dried. She disappeared again after fitting the cap and seemed unsure of sizing and duration , having to check with someone else. My head still felt so warm I thought the machine wasn't working, and it wasnt until my chemo was given that anyone was around to check. They felt the back of my head which was icy but didn't check anything else. After losing well over half my hair, I told them that the oncologist thought the cap size was wrong and was confronted by a very angry nurse saying 'oh yes he knows more than us trained in it. Anyway I don't care about hair. Loads lose it when scalp cooling anyway and nobody knows why.' The second and third sessions were much colder as my scalp was showing. I understand that it's labour intensive for the nurses, but in my case I'd had 4 operations and just about everuthing had gone wrong. A failed reconstruction, staph infection from the surgery, so everything had to be reopened and flushed clean of pus. necrosis, skin rotted because it had undergone 3 operations being pulled about so much, resulting in delayed healing, so for the staff to be so unsympathetic to me trying to at least keep my hair was devastating. I'm thinking of complaining now for the sake of others.",

      "Content": "Thanks Mf. Looking at the top of my head, it looks too perfect a bald circle to be random thinning, so I'm pretty sure it was because the cap wasn't touching my crown. The rest is too thin to cover the bald patch it looks ridiculous. Just a few scraggly strands that look like a bad comb-over . I'm stubbornly still coldcapping and this is the ONLY reason I haven't shaved it. The instant chemo ends, out will come the clippers! I do have some regrowth but whether I can hang onto it is another thing. I suppose I should be worrying about starting the taxotere/Herceptin cycles next week. I've been treated very well apart from this one nurse who got defensive. I was only concerned with getting it right the next time. Perhaps she was worried I'd complain. It never occurred to me before she got so angry. Not what I need right now. Gentle hugs back to you xx",
