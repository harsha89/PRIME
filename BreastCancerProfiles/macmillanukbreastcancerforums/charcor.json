    "Content": "Hi everyone, I am looking for advice regarding my mum. She is 79 years old and has had breast cancer for over 5 years, she has been on pills  medication all the time which worked and shrunk the cancer but recently we have been told the pills have stopped working and the cancer in growing back.  For all these years mums has been adamant the she didn't want an operation but with the new news the consultants ad surgeons are saying she should have the op before its to late to be able to have the op. As her daughter I want to support and have knowledge of how to approach this this mum, after all it is her choice and her body. i am also getting together so questions for her next appointment. I have lots of concerns because of her age for example, recover times, surviving the op, is it the best thing for her, should we leave things as they are or let her enjoy the rest of her time she has with her. She is also suffering with memory problems and we are awaiting a diagnosis for that. I am a worried daughter and want the best for my mum. Any help or advice would gratefully received. Thank you.",
