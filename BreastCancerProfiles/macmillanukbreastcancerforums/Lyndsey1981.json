      "Content": "I'm only on cycle 2 but I eat normally for the first few days whilst on steroids and then my taste just changes, I usually love flavoursome spicy foods but for 10 days after the steroids finished last time I could only manage the odd plain thing no flavour at all and infact I didn't eat much at all I lost 5 kilos in those 2 weeks (in the few of days before 2nd cycle was due got my appetite back did eat like a pig and put on 2.5 kilos but still managed to keep 2.5 off so was actually happy about that Lol) my steroids finished yesterday boo hoo and today I have woken with a sore throat just like last time, hopefully I won't end up in A&E like last time! I also suffered terribly with heartburn and reflux I mentioned it to my chemo nurses and Oncologist and they prescribed omeprazole which has helped massively I just take one every morning!! Good luck and make sure you let them know about all your side effects as they are honestly there to help!! Big hugs lyndsey xxx",

I was told I was having a bone and CT scan as it is part of the staging process (pretty bog standard) and also as there was lymph node involvement (even though minor) they do the scans just to be sure! My team have been extremely thorough and I can't thank them enough for everything they have done! big hugs Lyndsey xxx",

(I use these as paracetomol on its own does nothing for me) and also can we take zopiclone (sleeping pills) I was prescribed these when I was diagnosed and have only used them once in 4 months but I know some girls have said they can't sleep because of the steroids so are we allowed to use sleeping pills?? What other types of meds are we allowed to take? I have my pre chemo check tomorrow, having my PICC line put in on Tuesday (not looking forward to that) Onc appt on Wednesday and due to start chemo on Thursday (a busy week ahead) although I am still waiting for my thyroid biopsy results and also have had a stinking sinus infection which is slowly clearing up so I hope that won't delay things, it's just one thing after another ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜” sorry this was supposed to be a quick post lol Big Hugs Lyndsey xxx",

I had to have 2 ops as the first time round they didn't get clear margins and also found Cancer in 1 of 2 sentinel nodes, so I had to have more tissue removed and an ANC I am happy to say that yesterday I was told that this time that did get clear margins and also out of the 19 lymph nodes they removed none were affected!! I had pretty much convinced myself I was gonna end up having a mastectomy and I was wrong so try to stay positive!! I have an appointment with my oncologist on Wednesday to sort out my chemo, I have to have chemo because I'm triple negative but also there was node involvement and also it was quite big!! I am happy to get to the chemo stage as I am almost halfway through the treatment and the finishing line is getting nearer!! Try to stay positive hun I know it's hard!! I have to have a biopsy on my thyroid on Tuesday so am a bit worried about that but hopefully it will end up being nothing!! Big hugs Lyndsey xxx",

I have been in hospital for every cycle I have been twice in A&E where they gave me the option of going home and twice I've been admitted I'm hoping my stay is going to be shorter than last time!! Tax has wrecked my mouth and basically I have mouth ulcers everywhere even on my uvula (that hanging thing in your throat) this is why I havent been able to swallow and ended up dehydrated I now have a fabulous anaesthetic spray for my throat!!

I just want to tell you about a facebook group (if you haven't already heard of it) called younger breast Cancer network it is an amazing group for ladies under 45 who have breast cancer! If you are on facebook then I would definitely recommend it, it has been an absolute godsend! you need to find the group and then send them a private message (with a few details about yourself and your diagnosis) and then you will be invited to the secret group, anything you post in the secret group will not show up on your newsfeed so people that don't know about your Cancer won't see anything you are posting.

I was diagnosed on 20th June with IDC grade 3 recently finding out it's triple negative and Stage 2a my tumour is measured at 43mm. I am booked in for a lumpectomy and SLNB on 6th August, I have been told that my recent biopsies on my lymph node came back as benign but my surgeon is removing sentinel lymph nodes as a precaution, my Surgeon also said that he is not sure about Chemo yet which confused me as I thought that (and radiotherapy) was the only treatment for TNBC??? I'm now so worried about not having Chemo (I don't want people to think that I really want it but when there is not much else to treat me it worries me if I don't have it) I hope this makes sense!! My emotions are all over the place at the moment!! I have a daughter who is almost 3 years old and she is helping me be strong and I'm trying to be positive but some days are worse than others! I wake up with BC on my mind and go to sleep with it on my mind! Does it sound right that I may not have Chemo? My tumour is measuring quite big at 43mm and I am shocked they they are going straight to a lumpectomy I thought they may try to shrink it first!! The waiting in between appointments is driving me a little insane if I'm being completely honest! Any advice would be much appreciated. Thanking you all in advance Lyndsey xx",

      "Content": "Thanks for all of the replies, to be honest I'm a bit all over the place at the moment, most of the time I'm fine and then I will just burst into tears! I hate feeling like this!! I think it's because I'm not in control of this, if I didn't have my daughter I probably wouldn't care as much as I do but the thought of leaving her is breaking my heart!! The other night She even asked me if I was going to die, and last night she told me she doesn't want me to die!! She will be 3 in two weeks!! I just wish I didn't feel like this, I just can't be strong all of the time sometimes I just feel the need to cry!!! xxx",

I am usually quite a patient person but let's just say patience is not my friend right now!! I do trust my consultant it's just hard putting your life in someone else's hands , it doesn't help that I'm a natural born worrier lol. I will do my best to relax , I am already on sick leave from work so am just spending as much time with my daughter without upsetting her routine too much as if she realises mummy is at home she will not want to go to her grandparents lol what can I say .... She is a mummy's girl :) xxx Thanks again for replying I really appreciate it! Lyndsey xx",

      "Content": "Hi Angela, sorry you have had to join us but you will find a lot of support and comfort from this group!! I live in North West London and must admit I have never had much faith in my local hospital as in other areas it has never really performed too well, I had my daughter there etc and the standard of care was not the best, however since my diagnosis in June they have been absolutely amazing!! Maybe it is the Cancer status but I honestly wouldn't have gone anywhere else everything has been done pretty quick too (with the onvious waiting for results in between which can be frustrating) (my team have been extremely thorough and I feel like I have had every test/scan/biopsy known to man lol) I had excellent consultant/surgeons, BCNs and now oncologist and chemo nurses they are all just wonderful I must say also that my GP is really really good! She referred me straight away when I went to see her with my lump and as I'm only 33 I thought I may have a fight on my hands she did say she didn't think it was anything to be worried about but still sent me and I'm so thankful she didn't argue with me!! You need to do whatever is right for you and whatever makes you happier!! Take care let us know how u get on!!! Big hugs Lyndsey xxx",

      "Content": "Hi Ladies, I find it amazing how many of us young girls there actually are who are going through this, people always say 'but your so young' clearly cancer has no age preference, I'm 33 I was diagnosed on June 20th with grade 3 IDC with high grade DCIS triple negative, 47.5mm, I had my 2nd Op on Wednesday and have been in an awful state since then I had ANC which has completely floored me I have been in so much pain, I spent the whole day Friday vomitting!! I had my drain out yesterday which seemed to ease the pain but god I want this pain to bugger off!! I want to see my daughter who turned 3 last week! She is currently staying with her grandparents I know she is well looked after but god I miss her! I saw her briefly on Thursday after my op where she was completely fascinated by my drain she is a bit gory and loves a bit of blood lol she actually let me home as most of the time she becomes very clingy and will insist on coming home with me! She's such a good girl I feel like I should be spending all my time with her but at the moment feel so poorly I don't really want her witnessing that I am also trying not to upset her routine but with a bit of luck she will be home in a few days!! I miss her terribly!! Yesterday my 19 year old nephew who I have pretty much raised left for university so it was a very emotional day he got pretty choked up when saying goodbye which in turn reduced me to a blubbering mess lol! He is coming home next month for a weekend anyway as it's his birthday so I will see him soon but I am so proud of him!! I am very lucky to have an amazing support network, I have been with my partner since school it's actually our 17 year anniversary on the day I get my results from my last op! It must be so hard for my family who are going through this with me!! It is great to have other girls to speak to who know what I'm going through although obviously I wish none of us had to go through this at all!! I am always here for any of you girls if you need a chat! The facebook group Younger breast cancer network is an amazing group so if any of you aren't on there yet then join as that group has really helped me through some dark days!! Big hugs and lots of love Lyndsey xx",

I work in a hospital anyway so once chemo starts it would be stupid to put myself in that environment I dont drive either so to put myself on public transport for the journey to work would be quite irresponsible of me it's the best place to get ill at the best of times so when ur immune system is weak..... well let's just say you would pick up anything goin round especially in london lol xxx hope to see all you ladies over on facebook xxx",

It's a fantastic group (it doesn't show up in your friends newsfeeds so nobody needs to know what you are posting) so if you are on facebook you should think about joining, it's been a godsend to me!! If your interested search for younger breast cancer network send them a private message telling them your story so far and then they will add you to the group!! I would recommend this group to any young girls!! Big hugs we are all here to support you I had a very bad day yesterday had a bit of a meltdown but today has been a much brighter day!!

      "Content": "Hi everyone!! I hope everyone is doing well, I had a bone scan and CT scan a couple of days ago and have a follow up on Monday to get the results (I am so worried about these results) then on Wednesday I have my second Op which is excision of tumour bed and axillary lymph node clearance, I had my first op a month ago where unfortunately they didn't get clear margins and 1/2 sentinel lymph node was positive, I'm worried about these scan results as every single time I have been back for results I've had bad news!! Surely I am due some good news?? I am also worried as last year I had terrible shoulder pain after investigations It turned out I had a disc protrusion at c6 c7, my bro in law tells me not to worry (he is a doc) as I had an MRI and if there was any cancer there then it would've showed up however I can't help but worry!! I was in agony for 4 months and still have the odd ache and pain! It's just one thing after another! I am Triple negative which also worries me, my tumour was 47.5mm when they removed it, I just need some good news!! Today is my daughters 3rd birthday so I have a good distraction this weekend and then I get the results on Monday!! Can't say I am looking forward to op number 2 on Wednesday I have almost just healed from last op and now gotta do it all over again!! Things are never simple with me!! Big hugs to everyone Lyndsey xxx",
