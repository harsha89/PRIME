    "Content": "Hello, just looking for a bit of advice please! I found a lump on my breast last week, I was seen by my doctor who referred me to the breast clinic. I received my appointment for next week but a few days later I received confirmation from my doctor and on it it says \u20182ww suspected breast cancer rde\u2019 does a doctor put suspected breast cancer on most referrals as this is what they want to rule out? Or because they feel it\u2019s very likely it is? Also, does anyone know what \u2018RDE\u2019 stands for? I can\u2019t find anything on this. It\u2019s probably something simple but I would just like to know.Â  Thanks",
