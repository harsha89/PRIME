    "Content": "Hi I have had 2 of my 4 chemo treatments (taxotere cyclophosphamide & Avastin) I am amazed how good I feel! Don't get me wrong I am not normally the sort of person who bounces around saying nothing can upset me, but I truly feel ok. The first 4 days after the treatment I felt tired and a bit out of it, but 10 days today and I feel very close to normal. I am walking for an hour a day and eating healthy food (even though taste buds are not great) Up at 7 to get my children to school, and really ready for bed by 9pm. I presumed beforehand that I would be very ill but it has surprised me. Will be having 28 sessions of Radiation also. I say all this with complete respect for those who choose not to go through chemo - taking control of something which feels so much out of our control can help us. (Background - ILC -Bi-lateral Mast, lymph nodes clear but removed one side as tumour was 8cm, DIEP reconstruction)",
