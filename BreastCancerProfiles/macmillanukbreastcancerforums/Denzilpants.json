I am recovering from cancer you know I think I will probably make this target which fills me with hope amd confidence.  I also keep a personal diary of my progress and over the last 6 months  I cam see a steady  improvement  Good luck",

      "Content": "Hi Caroline  I can't offer any advice on your specific situation as mine was throat cancer but let me give you some reassurance  Firstly rhe way you are feeling is absolutely normal. There is a lot written about the effects of chemo and radiotherapy but very little about the psychological aftershock  I was doing SO well and then after 3 months out of the blue I felt like I had been hit by a truck  Couldn't eat,  sleep, got really emotional.  In the end I went to my doctor who said I was suffering post operative stress disorder and gave me prozac and sleeping pills My hospital were brilliant but I was very aware they were working to a timetable and yes there were more concerned about burning from the rads and I didn't get my scan till 5 months after rads finished so don't take it personally.  On my own case I am finding post treatment far more difficult 5han the actual treatment. Sorry to be a Jonah  The interesting thing is once treated you are not considered urgent . The critical thing from the hospitals view is that tbey get those awaiting treatment are processed first and therefore are their priority. Sorry to be that cynical but from the hospitals point of view you are now low priority, which I suppose is a slight reassurance  Oncologists hardly if ever use the word CURE so the fact they have is very encouraging  Most people will advise you not to Google your condition but I wanted to be forewarned and asked extremely probing questions about my condition which I thonk shocked the oncologist and they kinda sat up and took notice of me I wish you the very best. The next bit is very lonely. Keep going to  the counselling, this is now a psychological battle for you and the counsellors REALLY helped me  Good luck ",

Waiting in the queue for your first ride you're imagining all sorts Once you're strapped in you can't do anything but go along with it When you step.off the other end you see it was scary but nowhere near as scary as you thoight and we'll worth doing it Don't be afraid to be scared, we all are scared",

Let me tell you it is a bitch but you can do it. Lots and lots of painkillers.  As tough as it was the really tough bit for me is post treatment.  I am 5 months out of radio and have suffered, elation, depression,  hate , anger., despair, insomnia, etc etc and at the flick of a switch  A trip to  my doctor and a bucketfulof prozac has helped enormously.  My doctor said I was suffering post operative stress disorder and it was very very common.  So rest assured you are normal It is tough but doable. I was told by my oncologist not to expect a significant improvement fir at least  a year.  These things take time particular the psychological aftershock  Good luck  ",
