    "Content": "Hi destreza Like you today I have just joined this website and a few moments ago as I was completing the part tell us a bit about yourself and diagnosis that it hit home to me that their diagnosis is correct. I keep thinking they have made a mistake, it is all a bit of a shock as I have had no symptoms it was just picked up on my first routine breast screening and I feel they have made a big mistake and I am wasting their time when they cld be looking after people that need their help. I am a positive person but I am glad I have joined the website as good to know that Â others feel the same emotions I am currently experiencing and I don't want to add any worry to family members. Also like you I am wondering if I have done something wrong or I have eaten the wrong things. I have final confirmation of my treatment plan this afternoon so just want to get on with it now. Wish you luck and once they advise you of your treatment plan it make you more determined to deal with it. Stay strong x",
