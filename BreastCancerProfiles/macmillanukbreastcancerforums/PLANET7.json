    "Content": "You sound like a really good pal to your friends. If your friend who is starting chemotherapy loses her hair, your support in shaving your head so she doesn't feel so conspicuous when you are out together, may be appreciated. Alternatively, she may not want this. How hair loss affects a person, varies but it is pretty shocking to most of us when it starts, so see what happens and be guided by her as it is such a personal thing.  I lost virtually all my hair after the first chemo session, having cropped it short beforehand. The week it came out was hard but I was so glad I had very short hair as it fell out. I hated the feel of hats and the wig so I opt for using a small black cotton head square outdoors and this makes me feel comfortable and secure when out. I'd be lost without it.   Be guided by your friend along the way as each of us going through this is so different. Most of all, just go on doing the best you can - a good friend is invaluable - in good times and bad. You are lucky to have one another xx",
