      "Content": "Apologies for posting this 7 years on but I am still in shock after all this time and I feel pathetic. I was assured by my very offhand consultant that my 1cm dcis was nothing and to worry about and my surgery was non priority. After coming home to read my leaflet I realised that dcis wasn't quite as simple as he had made it sound and phoned my nurse who said I was worrying about nothing and they had other urgent surgeries to fit in before fine which would be in 6-8 weeks.  I was assigned a date and another consultant who told me she had very kindly fitted me in her very busy list and did I realise that dcis more often than not turned out to be invasive and if that it was the case then I would be back in to get my lymph nodes checked. Sure enough two weeks later I had to travel in 50 miles to be told my dcis was indeed invasive and she had a slot in 3 weeks time for my nodes to be checked.  At every visit I came away feeling absolutely distraught and nurses weren't much help and sat in the corner of the room with gloomy faces.  Sorry for rambling on but things are getting worse over time and can't seem to find any good news to feel positive about. ",
