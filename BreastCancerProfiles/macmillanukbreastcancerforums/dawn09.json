      "Content": "All i can say is DON'T rush back. The radiotherapy can leave you tired for longer than you think. Also it depends on whether your employer will agree to lighter duties for a while or whether you have a stressful job and you have to go back to full duties.  If you need to go back moneywise, then just be aware you may be very tired for the first while.  If it's not money, then take your GP's or Oncologist's advice and don't rush back.
