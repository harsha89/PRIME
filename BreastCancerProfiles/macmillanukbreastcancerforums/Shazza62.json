      "Content": "Hi Ruby Rose I have just been for my 6th weekly session of chemo and can hand on heart say I have had hardly any side effects.  You see cancer victims portrayed on TV as stick thin, no hair and chucking up for England and the reality is nothing like that. I sit with the same group of ladies on a Thursday morning, and if it wasn't for the fact that we were all plugged into chemo drips it is a lovely way to spend the day.  We laugh, sometimes cry, pass on bits of info, drink tea and eat biscuits.  I have lost some hair and sometime get tired but apart from that there is no difference whatsoever. I have actually put weight on because they are also giving me steroids and I get the munchies for any kind of crap food I can get my hands on. Please do not be afraid of having chemo, it really is not half as bad as you have imagined. Love Shazza",

      "Content": "My hair has been coming out now for 10 days and although it is definitely thinner especially on top, i still have plenty left.  Every day i wonder if today is the day i take the razor to it.  I already have 2 wigs, hats and scarves on standby but the thought of shaving it all off is still freaking me out. I think probably later this week is going to be the day when i bite my bullet and get it over and done with. No doubt there will be tears, but when all said and done it's only hair and it will grow back. I have also started losing hair \"down there\" but nothing from eyebrows, eyelashes, legs etc. Good luck with whatever you choose to do, but remember beauty comes from within. Sharon x   ",
