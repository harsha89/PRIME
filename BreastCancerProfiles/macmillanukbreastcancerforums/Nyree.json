    "Content": "Hi Vicky, How scary for you.  I'm no expert on breast cancer but would say from general experience of oncology clinics, definitely take someone with you, preferably someone level headed who can take notes for you.  There's something about clinics that seems to turn my brain off unless I'm making notes of what's being said. I think it's the stress!  Good luck with it, and do make very sure they know all about the second lump and swollen armpit.",
