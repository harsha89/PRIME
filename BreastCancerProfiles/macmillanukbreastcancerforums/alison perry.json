      "Content": "i also was told a lot of different things  when i was diagnosed but i was lucky my surgeon covered all areas i ended up  having my lump out and 8 nodes out , the nodes thing actually scared me more than the lump to be honest . i had chemo and double radio as the lump was so close to my skin .  i was 42 and your right  people seem to be younger and younger getting  breast cancer.  i think your age is  to do with  getting the whole packaged it feels me with horror when people say   they were lucky they didnt have chemo. my mother had breast cancer  also didnt hve chemo just radio and hers came back  im sure thats why .i was very lucky i sailed through my chemo  and i wish the same for all you ladies  im now coming up for my first mamogram  which im finding  more frightening than all the other processes xxxxx",

      "Content": "hi london girl i also a  ex london girl  lol  sorry  about your surgeon  i had a brilliant one  and ill tell you what she told me . we went through  all the diff routes  firstly she thought it would just be taking the lump out  no chemo etc. but whilst i was waiting i had it all in my head and i was prepare to have  my breast off . when results came back  it was in the middle had lump out , 8 lymph glands, and had to have chemo and radio plius extra  radio cos the lump was so close to my skin.  not at any point did she say omg etc. she said it will be a year of inconvenience out of you life then you get on with your life. she was right i was very lucky  the chemo didnt make me to bad  i was ill for 5 days after my chemo but that was cos of the injections i had to take to boost imune system . i hope all goes well for you  but if its the worst news goin in the with  all guns firing im  sure my positive out look help me through it .xxxxxx",
