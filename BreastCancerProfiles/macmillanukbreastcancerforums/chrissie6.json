      "Content": "i was shocked when i was first told after my first mammagram and i think its just the word cancer thats the hardest to get your head round , and yes it feels the same way for me feeling ime the only one, because friends etc dont have it n dont really understand how it feels. my mum died at 36yrs old with this and i always think ime going down the same path. although she found it n died only 2 months later but there was no treatments then and thats what i hold on to.",

      "Content": "hi caz, yes i agree it takes away your confidence, i had a lumpectomy in jan and finished rt 5 weeks ago so i was, i suppose one of the lucky ones and didnt have to have chemo. i wont go out alone anymore,and the lumpectomy took quite a chunk so i always feel others can see it even though they proberbly cant. just the same as you i worry all the time about the cancer coming back so its always on your mind. your not alone with this. chrissie.",
