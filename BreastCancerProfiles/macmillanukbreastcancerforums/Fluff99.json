      "Content": "Hi ladies I am the opposite way round to you and have had surgery with Chemo to follow.  Had mx on 14th July with imm implant reconstruction.  I can honestly say it wasn't as bad as I imagined.  I stayed in hospital for 2 nights and had 2 drains put in.  The first drain came out the day after I left hospital and the 2nd one 2 weeks after.  For me personally, the drain was the biggest pain!  By the end of the 2 weeks I kept walking off and forgetting to take it with me!  The pain wasn't too bad and I would describe it more as discomfort.  I was given Codeine to take home, and had the odd Ora-Morph whilst in hospital. Unfortunately I had to go back in for surgery last Tues to tidy the wound up as it wasn't healing as quick as they expected.  When I was in theatre it was discovered the implant wasn't right so they had to remove it.  Again I stayed in 2 nights and this time the second drain came out within 2 days.  I came out of hospital Thurs last week and I was back at work yesterday!  Yes it's sore and I feel a bit trussed up with wearing the sports bra etc but generally I am doing really well, so please try not to worry, easier said than done! Any questions, please do ask xx",

I will be having another op Feb time to put the implant in so maybe it will tie up with the results too? I hope so as if it's positive then I would def go ahead with more surgery. I did wonder if it takes longer when there are no living relatives to test too? Anyway thanks for replying xx",

My surgeon previously said they would be very surprised if I had the Brca gene, however this Dr said he disagrees with that and thinks it's quite possible I do!  I feel a bit deflated even though I knew it was a possibility. The results will take 8 weeks to process, so I feel in Limbo now. Part of me thinks I've had the worse thrown at me already, with the BC diagnosis and any further surgery if it's needed is just preventative and the other half is worrying like mad!

      "Content": "I am 11 days post last chemo and really struggling emotionally. I've had 4 rounds of EC reduced from 6 due to side effects. I've found each round tougher physically and emotionally and I am really struggling this time. Not helped probably that I'm in quite a bit of pain still. From speaking to people and reading posts on here I know it's quite common to feel like this at the end of treatment but I can't keep waking up every day with this dreaded fear. I'm also waiting for the BRCA results  which probably doesn't help. I also feel a bit in limbo as because chemo was \"belts and braces\" I don't have scans before or after so nothing \"physical\" to say it's done it's job. I've not seen anyone throughout chemo e.g. Oncologist other than to write me a prescription for Tamoxifen.  My husband says each day will get better and I'm hoping he's right. It's still early days and I do feel pretty down after each chemo session for a while then bounce back up again. I gues my question is do I take action now e.g.see a counsellor etc or give it a bit more time until I start to feel physically stronger and hopefully this will help mentally. Most of the ladies I've spoken to have found a counsellor helpful so maybe I need to bite the bullet? It's helped writing it down here. Thanks for listening x",

      "Content": "Hi I too had the predicament of node clearance. I was more worried about this op than the mx due to side effects etc. One node was affected with disease just touching 2mm. If it had been under 2mm I wouldn't have been offered the clearance. Plus all other nodes looked clear on ultrasound.  I spoke to one of the surgeons and he advised it may do more harm than good. I think Helsbels posted about affecting survival? My Consultant said the same, in his opinion it would not affect long time survival.  However the ONC said due to my age (39) he would advise it, another surgeon said the same.  So I went for it. All nodes removed were clear.  I only had the op in Aug but so far all ok. My arm is still numb on the underside / armpit, and it feels tingly most of the time.  Would I do the same again? Probably not. I would have gone with the Consultants advice. Easy for me to say though now I've done it! Xx",

Back ache, neck ache etc and I was convinced it had spread. I phoned my nurse and she said it was such a common thing for people newly diagnosed to feel like that and it was very unlikely it had spread.  I lost my mum 13 years ago to Ovarian Cancer and convinced myself the same was going to happen to me. As everyone has said the treatment has progressed so much in that time that my team have said its not even worth comparing.  Once you know what's ahead in terms of treatment it does make things easier. It may not seem so at the moment, but it really is the waiting that's the worse bit.  Sending hugs Xx",

I think it's referred to as the post anaesthetic blues.  I'm 39 and I was diagnosed last June, I had a mastectomy with temporary expander followed by chemo. In January I discovered I have the faulty brca2 gene so I had preventative surgery last week on the other side again with temporary expander, implants to be put in both sides Jul/Aug time. I felt exactly the same as you initially, but as everyone says it does get better once a plan is in place. Initially I thought I wouldn't be here to even see Christmas, or see my 6 yr old grow up.  I'm in a much better place now though. We're even getting a dog today! Not sure how wisely is trying to walk a dog in one hand and a drain in the other but hey ho!  I've had a couple of counselling sessions too which have been good, that's always an option for you if you think it would help.

The Oncotype is more accurate than predict hence why I would like that as if the benefit from that shows a higher percentage then I wouldn't hesitate. she also told me that for me the Tamoxifen would probably be of more benefit than the chemo due to strong er+ status. I am quite \"lucky\" as a lot of women under 45 have a more aggressive type of cancer than mine.

      "Content": "Thanks Lynn. I had a very interesting conversation with my BCN this morning regarding the Oncotype Test. Apparently I can have it. However as one node is affected it's only available privately not on the NHS. I wish I'd been told this when I first enquiried as I was told with one node involved it wasn't an option. It is very much an option just I have to pay for it!  Always worth asking I guess xx",

At least I know it's quite normal to feel like this.  I didn't end up going to work today as I felt so emotional this morning so I took all your advice and put my head down. I ended up sleeping for 3 hours so my body obviously needed it!  Hopefully tomorrow will be better x",

      "Content": "Hi all Is it common to have post surgery blues? I had lymph node removal on Friday. Felt a lot better than I thought so went back to work yesterday for a bit of \"normality\". However the last day or so I feel like just getting into bed and not getting back out until all this is over! I feel like an old woman. This is only after surgery too so goodness knows what a wimp I'll be during chemo. I'm usually fairly positive but I'm finding I wake up and it's the first thing on my mind until I go to bed again. My husbands response - get some antidepressants. Thanks for that!  I don't really have any other family although friends have been great, but unless people have been through something like this they can't really understand how I feel. I keep being told ill be fine and I'm so brave etc when actually all I want to do is cry. I feel a burden to my husband and little girl. He is very work orientated and since being diagnosed at the end of June he hasn't taken any time off even though I've had 3 major surgeries, which I feel resentful of.  He deals with things in the manner of well just get on with it, hence why he's carried on as normal. I wish I could be a bit more like that. People have said its post anaesthetic blues. I have had 3 ops since 14 July so maybe it's all coming out now ! Sorry for the poor me routine but feel I needed to get it off my rather flat chest! Xx",

      "Content": "Hi G n J Thanks for the response. I think because I had been told his would be the hardest surgery to recover from so far, I was so pleased that I felt OK, I wanted to carry on as normal. I only work 2 days a week and it's a desk job so not physically demanding and we have such a giggle I thought it would do me good, which it did to be honest. It's also a lot easier than running around after an energetic 6 year old which is what I would have been doing :-)  I'm only there today and then tomorrow I plan to take my little girl out somewhere nice then rest Thurs & Fri.  I feel guilty at the moment for relying on childminder so much but my daughter enjoys it there and it gives me chance to have a couple of days rest.  Xx",

I was worried too with regards to the lymph node being affected and asked on more than one occasion why I wasn't scanned. They were very confident everything had been picked up and therefore I didn't need one. It is worrying though when everybody else seems to be scanned and you're not. X",

      "Content": "Hi Sarah  Sorry you've had to join us here but you can find some really good advice on here and some lovely people to share worries with.  I was diagnosed at the end of June with grade 2 BC. I have a 6 year old daughter and I told her more or less straight away. One thing I haven't said is the word Cancer. Mainly because she knows my mum passed away from it and also because at 6 she doesn't need to know or understand the ins and outs. I basically told her mummy wasn't well and had to go in hospital for an operation (mastectomy) and my boob would look different from before. She has seen it and wasn't bothered by it at all. She knows I'm having an implant and her opinion is \"it'll be fine when it grows back\"! I will be having chemo too and she did get upset when I said I may lose my hair. That passed in about 30 seconds! Although she has asked if I can get a different coloured wig everyday.  I try and answer any questions she has but to be honest she hasn't really asked much. Life is very much as normal for her. The only change was when I was in hospital. I had 3 ops in a month as as these occurred during the school hols she had to go to childcare and stayed with friends a couple of times. The change in routine did bother her a bit as she is very much a fan of routine! Once I was up and about though things settled down. Please try not to worry as I'm sure you're more worried about their reactions and they may surprise you. Kids are very resilient.  As for the surgery, it wasn't nearly as bad as I had feared. I stayed in hospital for 2 nights and once home just rested really for the first week on and off. For me the most annoying part were the drains. You come home with one or two drains which basically stay in until they are draining under a certain amount or they come out after a certain number of days. My daughter was fascinated by these and had to check every morning how much has come out! They don't hurt but after a while you forget they are there and end up walking away without them. I had mine for 13 days and it was a relief once they were out. I was lucky in terms of recovery and went back to work after 2 weeks. I could have gone back earlier if I had the drains removed.  Please be aware about potential post surgery blues too! After my 3 op and 4 days post surgery I burst into tears for no apparent reason and cried for about half an hour on my own like a snivelling wreck. Then fell asleep for 3 hours and woke up absolutely fine! The lovely people on here explained it was absolutely normal. You may not get it as after my mastectomy I was totally fine. Just don't worry that you've turned into a raving mad woman as it's very common. I'm sorry if I've gone on too much. I feel I've written the next War and Peace! But I just wanted you to know that you are not alone and this journey is doable. Yes you'll have days where you feel like screaming why me. But the further down the road you get and the more you know what's happening the better it is.  Hope that helps and wasn't too confusing.  Sending big hugs and please ask if you want to know anything else xx",
