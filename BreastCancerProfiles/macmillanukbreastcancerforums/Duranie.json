      "Content": "That's pretty much it, its raw and unpasteurised. I used to have Greek yoghurt and honey every day but had to to stop because I was told not to eat either. Lidl's own brand Greek yoghurt was the only safe one or I made my own with easy yo if I wanted the honey flavour.  I have been through it twice in 6 years so I just didn't want to risk it, I was a lot more strict on what I ate than a lot of people are though. Good luck with treatment x",

      "Content": "Pat G I wore the dark nail varnish the whole way through chemo. 2 weeks after last docetaxol I started to lose my nails - lost all 10 nails & have now lost one toe nail but in fairness when the nails did fall off the new one underneath was well grown up - was upset at the first 2 or 3 that fell off but after that I realsied no point worrying as they are growing back real quickly. Wish the eyebrows & eyelashes were as quick no sight nor light of them at all !! Hair resembles a brillo pad at the mo not a pretty sight ha ha !! But dont be worrying all that falls out or off will sooner or later come back - the sooner the better though !! Has anyone got the numb feeling in their feet ? If so when if ever does it go away? hi, the numb soles of the feet may not go away, it is my one lasting side effect that hasn't gone yet, I am still on painkillers from my onc for it. It's called peripheral neuropathy",
