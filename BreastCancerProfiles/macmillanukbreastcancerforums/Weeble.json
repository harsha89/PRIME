      "Content": "Hi Mags I had my last chemo on 11 March and now have a good covering of hair. My 16 year old daughter thinks I should shave it all off again as she thinks I look better without it. I'm not sure if I should be flattered or offended ha ha. My hair started coming out in clumps about a week after my 1st treatment and I had a neighbour come and use the clippers on it. It's quite an ordeal while it's happening but once it's gone, it's actually quite a relief. I didn't even bother wearing my wig. I quite enjoyed seeing people's expressions when I was walking about bald as an egg. If you can't use the clippers, maybe just cut it as short as possible with scissors. Eventually I went into the bath, put my head under the water and just gave it a good rub and the last of it fell out. Hope you get on ok and best wishes to your mum",

My passport expired about 3 weeks ago and I said I wasn't renewing it just now because I didn't want to be stuck with a picture of me with weird hair for 10 years. Having said that, how often do you look at it? Have you got a wig? You could have the picture taken wearing it. I don't think you'd have a problem with passport control as people change their hair styles all the time. It's my 50th birthday early next year so I'm going to have to go ahead do it as we want to go away. x",

Was told to still go for next Herceptin anyway as it was still within 'normal' range and they'll see what the results of the next one are. Good thing is apparently it's not permanent and the heart recovers as soon as Herceptin stops. Happy birthday btw.

I couldn't get comfy in bed as I couldn't lie on either side. I was getting desperate as I can't sleep on my back so hardly slept at all. I've no advice other than to go with what the physio is telling you. It will work. I had to massage myself which was fine as it was at the front. I've noticed a huge difference over the last couple of weeks and the scar tissue has softened to the point I can hardly feel it. Keep going with the exercises. All the best xx",

She made an appointment with the oncologist so we could discuss it but when I went for the appt, it was a new oncologist who decided I was post menopausal (even though my blood test showed otherwise) but suggested zoladex injections. I didn't want the injections either so the decision was made to wait and see if my periods came back. If so, I'll be advised to have my ovaries out and they can then give me one of the drugs they prescribe for post menopausal ladies. No doubt if I see my original oncologist, this subject will be raised again. I got the impression my case had not been discussed with the new doctor and he had no idea why I was there. As far as I'm aware, the procedure itself is quite straightforward and normally done by keyhole and as day surgery. x x",

There's no way I can think about going back to work and getting my life back with no sleep, horrendous hot flushes and sweats and feeling like a basket case most of the time. I spoke to my Bcn who obviously couldn't agree that I should stop but did say at the end of the day it's about quality of life. i think you have to do what's right for you.

However, I'm not so sure now and am seeing a plastic surgeon next Wednesday for a consultation. I thought everyone with bc was entitled to recon if they want it. It doesn't have to look false. Your breast or plastic surgeon should be able to advise which type is best for you. My breast surgeon said he wouldn't give me implants as they wouldn't suit my frame and would look false. He did offer LD flap which is from the back but I don't really want that as it would be both sides for me. I have seen one though. A lady at a recon info session stripped off to let me see and it was amazing. It was identical to her other breast. I suppose it depends on how good the surgeon is too. The ps I'm seeing does diep and if I have recon at all, that will be the one I'll have. I don't think age is a factor. My mum was 70 at dx and she was offered it but turned it down. I'd ask for a referral so you can discuss it with the experts. You can always change your mind x",

I had seroma after mx and my bcn got me to go to her every week for it to be drained and said they would stop doing it once they were getting under 50ml. This happened after 6 weeks and it's been absolutely fine ever since. I never once got a infection either. Hope you get it sorted out. I know how uncomfortable it can be. x",

I even had one at the base of my thumb. Has anyone else experienced this? My skin was like a baby's during chemo. Clear as a bell and totally unlined. I'm guessing this might just be a result of the chemo drugs leaving my system and everything will settle down. I certainly hope so anyway. I'm spottier than my teenager. It feels like I'm going through menopause and puberty at the same time. Could it be my hormones kicking back in? Maybe my periods will start again and I'll grow a new pair of boobs lol!! xx",

At my follow up appointment, this changed to 35mm, grade 3 and her2 positive. I've completed 18 weeks of chemo, had a bilateral mastectomy 12 days ago and have started Herceptin. I'm also beginning tamoxifen tomorrow. I had a follow up appointment today with the surgeon who told me there was no sign of any cancer in the tissue he removed and he doesn't need to see me again till September. I was delighted with the news but then fell apart when I got home after barely shedding a tear the whole time when having treatment. I also feel bad as although I wanted to give him a big hug, all I could do was smile politely and say thank you and I can't help feeling he must think me the most ungrateful person in the world.

If there's anyone out there who's not had any problems with it, it would be great to hear from them. My biggest concern is weight gain.

No way am I being stuck with a 10 year passport with a picture of me with my post chemo hair. Mind you it might make some of those miserable passport control people smile!! Lol x",

      "Content": "Hi I had a bilateral mastectomy in April (after chemo) and was adamant at the time I had no interest in reconstruction. I think it's maybe easier if it's double rather than single. I would have had more of an issue with being lop sided. My mum had a single mastectomy 5 years ago and is happy just using her prosthesis. However she was 70 and said if she was my age (49) she would've had recon. She would have had to have more surgery on her existing breast to even them up and she didn't want any more ops than necessary. It is a very personal choice. Some people have a strong emotional attachment to their breasts. I didn't as I am very small but had large breasts. It's quite liberating to wear tops I never could before and get up in the morning and just pull on a t shirt. I was given amazing breast forms (Amoena) but as yet I haven't worn them as I have a lot of hard scar tissue along my ribs which makes wearing a bra uncomfortable. I haven't completely ruled out recon and am going to an info session later this year run by Breast Cancer Care so I can make an informed choice. I have heard that you get a better result with immediate recon rather than delayed but I'm no expert.  If your partner is considering recon, I'm sure her surgeon will be able to advise what the best option would be. My surgeon advised me against implants but the surgery is much longer and more complicated if they use your own tissue so it's a big decision. All the best to you both x",

As I have delayed my decision I'll probably have quite a long wait if I decide to go ahead so you'll be having your op long before me if I do want to have it. I think I'd also go with the stomach fat one as I'm not lacking in that lol. It is a hard decision especially as I'm finished treatment now apart from Herceptin and about to go back to work. I'm hoping this information session I'm going to will help me. Best wishes x",
