Tjuanks as well for the info on the breast info as heard something about that and it is something I will definately look into in the future as I do have a rather large dent.

I like it because it is not really obvious NO REGRETS at all. Will let you know how I get on with my results and a big thank you again for your support. Hilary xx",

I think I have aged 1 year for every month this has been going on but I think I am nearly at the end now and looking forward to moving on and this was something I thought I could do just for me. Well I did it tonight and they said it takes about 4 days to see the benefits but i feel a lot better already lets just hope I don't get up in the morning looking like the elephant woman. Hope you see the light at the end of your tunnel soon and best of luck with everything big hugs Hilary xx                        ",
