    "Content": "I too had a lot of pain, My breast had the symptoms of mastitis. I was given antibiotics by GP and a password to book breast clinic myself as a precaution. Well needless to say antibiotics were useless but I delayed the appointment thinking they would clear it grrr . By the time I went for mastectomy my bra size had gone from D cup to DD cup to E cup, to accommodate the growing tumor. It had spread to lymph gland. I had full mastectomy and 10 lymph glands removed 2nd of June. I started my chemo on Wednesday. The misconception that it is painless and usually pea sized is frankly dangerous. Mine even fooled the GP the breast was so inflamed. You are not alone Renee. xxx",
