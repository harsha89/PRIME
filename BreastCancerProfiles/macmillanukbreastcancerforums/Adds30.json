      "Content": "Hi there  I too have had pain and a lump in my left breast. I had an ultrasound and biopsy, I was told I have a papilloma which is benign however has B3 which means it has malignant potential. I am due to have it removed on 19th Jan, when they remove it they can then put the whole growth/s under a microscope to test the whole area to be 100% certain the it's all benign.  I would defenitly go and get a second opinion. Even if it is a papilloma like me it still needs to be investigated.  Good luck x",

      "Content": "Hi there,  Feel a bit of a fraud joining here but have nowhere else to go.  I'm currently waiting on biopsy results and really in abit of limbo. I'm 30 years old with 2 young children.  I've had pain in my left breast for quite a few month since stopping breastfeeding in July. I noticed a lump just under my nipple last week and had my breast clinic appt yesterday. I've used my private healthcare so thankfully things are moving quickly.  I was hoping at the appt yesterday they would say it was a cyst but instead they've taken a biopsy. They said it could be a papilloma, something blocked in milk duct, pre cancerous cells etc.  Just feeling a little blah! ",
