      "Content": "Hi, I'm very interested to hear how you get on as There seems to be a lot of us in a similar position.  I was also told that revision surgery could be done further down the line, as I had my bilateral surgery only last August, however I have not had a follow up appointment yet. I suspect I will be told the flaps remaining are my own fat lumps and therefore not eligible for surgery.  Is this likely? Good luck with the operation and do please fill us in as knowing the truth gives us knowledge. Raspo",

How long do you think it will be before you are back to normal? As you can see I would love to have my scars sorted but seem to be weighing up is it worth the pain. Hope your recovery is swift.

      "Content": "Hi, Thanks for the update, I'm very pleased to hear all went well. I had my revision surgery 2 and a half weeks ago under a general anaesthetic. Both sides were done plus one side central scar revision.  It went very well I had surgery at 1.30pm and was home by 7pm.  I am very pleased with the results apart from, like you, a square corner, when I look down it appears like an off centre nipple, very strange.  They are going to have an assessment in 3 months when I hope they will remove this excess skin. I was quite apprehensive before the op but like you would recommend this procedure if you are not satisfied with your original results. Good luck for the future.",

What reasons did you give to your surgeon to get the funding.  I feel I need to be prepared before my next consultation. Raspo",

      "Content": "Hi, Six weeks on from a bilateral mastectomy I have just received my breast forms from the NHS.  I had an appointment at the hospital where I stood for 20 minutes with specialist breast fitter shoving different breast forms in and out of my bra.  I had done some previous research and had bought various bars which were suitable for Protheses and had decided which I preferred and had decided what size I wanted to be. All went reasonably well and after a short time a pair were selected which were regarded by my fitter to be the best available. I collected these from the hospital 3 days later, what a service and to be fair so far I'm very pleased. My question is......  What does one do when you go on holiday, as both of these Protheses need to be replaced in their boxes every night to restore their shape.  The boxes are enormous, they would take up almost a whole suitcase.  Do I need to purchase cheaper, less care sensitive forms, any suggestions? Also do I really need to wash them every night if I put them in their silk/Cotten pouches? I sound like a real lazy person but really I'm trying to get to grips with the practicalities of looking after my new Protheses and how to cope with travelling and just visiting friends without taking an extra vehicle and making everything very obvious. Any suggestions would be gratefully received. Raspo99",

      "Content": "Hi All, Thanks for all your replies and support. It's so strange having to adjust to these new circumstances in such a short period of time.  We have to make instant decisions prior to surgery which are life changing and then have to deal with the consequences. I seem to be lucky at present as my recovery is going well although I have already been advised that corrective surgery will be necessary, two very large satsumas sits under my armpits, a dog ear would be preferable to my present excess of fatty tissue. Anyway, I am enjoying my new Protheses, and would love to show them off to my family but I am trying to workout how, when sleeping at grandchildren's home, how when they pile in in the morning onto our bed I can camouflage the lack of boobs.  I think I will wear a cotton bra with softies under my nightshirt. Once again any suggestions...... Many thanks for your thoughts.",
