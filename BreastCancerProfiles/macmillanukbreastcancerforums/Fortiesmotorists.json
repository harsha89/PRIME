      "Content": "I was diagnosed with breast cancer in May this year and I have already had two operations. The first one being a mastectomy with immediate reconstruction with a silicon implant on my right breast and the second one last Tuesday the 24th July a ancillary lymph node clearance. They performed the surgery just under my right armpit, the pain and the numbness sensation is unbearable and the lack of movement in my right arm is very frustrating. Does this improve over time? Can anyone advise on ideas in how to cope with this, people where not joking when they said this surgery is worse than the breast removal and reconstruction. I am also waiting results to see what treatment is next for me, I am scared its going to be chemotherapy/radiotherapy or both.",
