      "Content": "Hi Mark, I too am a carer and struggling to cope with my partners diagnosis. He has bowel cancer, and had a sigmoid colectomy only yesterday. But it's been diagnosed nearly 3 months ago and we've had to go through a roller coaster ride of further tests and waiting for results, and then more waiting for mdt decisions. I nearly had a nervous breakdown, but was referred to a councillor by our McMillan nurse. She's helped me cope a bit better, with help from my gp and district nurses who have been looking after johns wounds following a lung biopsy. I too feel helpless at times and I feel guilty for feeling down as its not my illness. Both myself and John try to talk to each other about our feelings, and we take everything one day at a time. John may need chemo next, once he's over his surgery, and I'm sure that will bring more emotions. Keep in touch, it helps to read everyone else's experiences. I hope you and your wife get some positive news soon. Lots of hugs and positive vibes for you both. Sharon",

      "Content": "Oh and one more thing, try to do something nice together every day, even if it's just to go for a short walk holding hands. You both need to have some sort of a distraction so it enables you to think of something else, even if it's just for 15 mins. Otherwise the cancer is on your mind 24 hours a day and there's no escape. Xxx",
