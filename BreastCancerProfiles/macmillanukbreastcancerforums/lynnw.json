    "Content": "Hello, I am just new to the site, I am 42 yrs old and was diagnosed on 1st Dec with breast cancer. Reading your post has certainly given me hope and optimism about cytotoxic drug therapy. I am due to start on FEC regimen for first three cycles then docetaxel for last three.  Im sorry I cant answer your question but as the healthcare professionals advocate that all individuals are different and every one responds differently. But you have certainly given me hope. Lynn",
