      "Content": "Having read the thread, I have to forewarn potential patients seeking Iort treatment on NHS there is no availability at this time, today 28th February 2019. I have explored all avenues.  I was prepared to travel anywhere in the UK and was given potential surgery dates at only one hospital, which have just been withdrawn.  My last hope has been dashed because of lack of availability of the oncologists who do the Intrabeam radiotherapy. If the NHS would grasp this, money would be saved, oncologists would be freed up, as less time is needed and women's health would be improved. If anyone has had the treatment privately, how long did you wait and where did you go? Today is day 62 from my referral, the 31 day 'target' from decision to treat was missed (standard treatment) and there is a current wait of 12 weeks here for external radiotherapy at my local hospital, far longer than the optimum time.  If you're asking why Iort is not given as an option, including at Swindon, where one poster had surgery, this is probably why. Another reason is that consultants, including the local one to whom I was referred, have not even heard of the treatment. Please don't raise your hopes. If you have private insurance, stay on the NHS list until it's done somewhere. ",

      "Content": "Wow, thank you so much for a quick reply. I've only just joined this forum,, so haven't worked out if there's a direct message facility, Did the cost you mentioned elsewhere include all the post op follow ups or just the surgery? What happens about hormone treatment afterwards e.g. letrozole, which I anticipate from both local hospital with traditional treatment or Iort? Do you pay for that or do NHS still do it?  Did you have any guidance about what to do if there is an urgent problem, e.g. infection? We are also not in London, but not too far. The wonderful surgeon you had is the one with whom my initial contacts were, so I am pursuing this privately now, but it will be a big undertaking financially, of course.The timescale you had sounds hopeful, but the NHS situation is probably worse than it was then. Thanks again.",

Even if the local consultants are aware of this treatment, today they would waste people's time  to discuss it. It is heartbreaking and symptomatic of NHS problems. No-one can break the cycle  in order to offer better, cheaper treatments, so money and time continues to be wasted and we all suffer, not just breast cancer patients. I shall write to the health minister and my M.P. which will make me feel better, if nothing else. Best wishes.",

Did it take long to secure Femara or did they have it in stock? The hospital initially provided Manx, which was O.K. then the doctor's pharmacy has issued Accord for 2 months, now this month it's Neva. 2 days in, I have unusual headaches, which I never get, so I will be watching it carefully.  I am fed up with getting only one month at a time.

      "Content": "So sorry you're here noswad1. It's so scary. I was sure I had breast cancer as soon as I found the lump. The radiographer's reaction pretty much confirmed it, but also found a 2nd lump, at which point I assumed it had spread and I was a gonner. However, the presence of a 2nd lump did not indicate that but, as s first-timer, how do you know that? I went to hell and back for 4 weeks until I saw the consultant who confirmed it was cancer and that it was small, ER positive and curable. They seemed surprised I wasn't upset at that point! Bit late - I'd done 4 weeks of that. So, the message is, try not to panic when you have the scan. ER+ is the most common type and has the best prognosis of a bad bunch. It's a horrible time waiting. Yes, my treatment is complete and declared clear. I hope your outcome will soon be the same. ",
