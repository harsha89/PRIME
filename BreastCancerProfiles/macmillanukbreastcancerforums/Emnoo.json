      "Content": "Hi Georgie, firstly so sorry that you are going through this rubbish, though welcome to here.  I'm newish too, had a right mastectomy and nodes removed last Tuesday.  I was quite surprised how good I have been actually, I have managed to be quite independent (much to my husband monitoring me - bless) though you do need to be careful and make sure you rest. I have found I have been quite tired in the afternoons and have had to just sit down (not good at that either but am listening to my body). I do have a gorgeous 2 yr old and to be honest that is where I have needed the help.  I can't lift her, and up until yesterday could not change her bottom.  Washing your hair is a bit of a mare too... I would say quite a lot of support for the first couple of weeks, I tried to do too much to start - its silly, let people take care of you. And the exercises as daunting as they seem on the first day you do them - be strong and religious about doing them as by doing your exercises you will get strong again. Hope this helps, if you want to PM me please do, I'm a few weeks ahead of you and happy to share my experiences... Em xx",

      "Content": "A lovely new baby, congratulations lovely....though my thoughts are with you so much, what a shock, you have every right to be angry, and you should be when you need to be.  I basically had a good old shout whilst driving my car on my own the other day at the top of my lungs, had some odd looks (goodness must have looked like a right loon) but it worked I felt so much better.  I am 35 with a daughter and was diagnosed with breast cancer the day before my daughters 2nd birthday on 7th Dec - again complete shocker. I have a mastectomy booked on Tuesday and then chemo will follow... Do you have a good family / friend support network, have you looked to see if you can get any support or if there are any groups you can attend, you need to make sure you get some time out for your sanity but appreciate how difficult it is to find 'time out' with a new born.   Though your bubba will get you through the bad times, just a little smile( he'll be smiling about now no?) think if the summer months and how much fun he will be, and how much better you will be feeling by then.  Each day as it comes, let your emotions do what they will and lean on your friends, they will want to help you.  Mine have done an on-line rota style thing to support me, bless them they are so organised it has made me giggle but feel very loved, as I am sure you are.   Here for you lady...   Emma x",

I'm happy they are having a nice day though, really very, just wish so much I could be there with them today...  I think day 3 I have just had enough, though it was not as bad as the first round, and my only really gripe so maybe I should drag myself out of my pit and get on with it, though it is hard.  I think I need to allow myself these few days to be a little sad, as the rest of the time I really feel like all is well and everything will be ok... I still got my hair, though itchy head makes me think that's next.... Ooof sorry so low, but my only outlet today, am starting a journal soon  ",

Have you been allocated a nurse and have you asked.  I put my op off until the NY and they said wouldn't make any difference.  I was keen to have a normal Christmas with my husband and 2yr old (plus move house!) before...

I did get angry today in the car as a man was really rude to me however I drove past him smiled and then continued to shout in the car as if I was speaking to him - I must have looked like a loon, though it made me laugh and feel better - a bit of colourful language at high volume in the safety of your car! Really hope the recovery goes well Lucy, at least we have not got to venture out n the awful weather and can nest for a while (looking for the pro's always!).  Thanks again, Em xx  (PS Ikea was awful, but brilliant!)",

      "Content": "Ahoy there... I am 35 years young and was diagnosed with breast cancer on 7th Dec, the day before my daughters 2nd birthday. I have to have a mastectomy and my lymph nodes removed -  How can your life change so much over night, I am absolutely terrified.  When do you stop waking up thinking this is not real? Every morning I have a moment where I forget and then it comes crashing down.  All in all, I feel I am coping ok so far and everyone tells me I am being amazing but I am not sure how else I would be, it\u2019s not like I can just cry all day?! Though I am not sure I have actually cried, not properly only after a few glasses of wine on a couple of occasions, but not as I suspected, or feel I should have?  I guess having my daughter and wonderful husband make me feel so very strong \u2013 and my amazing friends that are doing things like inline calendars so we can call on any of them at anytime if I/ we need some help.  I know it\u2019s the start of a long journey but I cannot help but think awful things and worry... we just moved into a new flat and I\u2019ve been buying things for it, nesting as you do, even a trip to the dreaded ikea today, it has been the best distraction... But I keep thinking should I be doing this, should I not be instead putting money aside for my husband and daughter if ...?! These thoughts have to be normal, I\u2019m sure of it?  As positive as I try to be these thoughts are at the back of my head \u2013 I think maybe a support group is a good idea.  I\u2019m not a great talker but wondered if people have found these helpful/ chat rooms etc? How do I get rid of these thoughts \u2013 I just wish wish I could know for sure that after this year is over, after the surgery, chemo, radiotherapy etc I will be ok... I will won\u2019t I? Sorry to be so down, I know it may not help others but this is my only real outlet at the moment and it helps... Bon voyage",

      "Content": "Hi Jules, thanks so much for your reply, goodness a bit spooky indeed! I'm glad you are recovering well, and that your little boy is keeping you positive - bless them.  Does he just understand Mummy has a poorly booby, that's what my daughter keeps saying as my biopsy bruised me quite badly so had a black boob for a few weeks, guess good practice for her, though it has not stopped her dive bombing me in the morning for a hug - gorgeous!.  They pick up on stuff  though you are right eh. I still don't really understand when they say they found 3 out of 15 in the lymph nodes - I have read that result a million times, I probably sound really naive but some information is just not registering, I'm normally quite bright - oof! I have been told I will be having chemo already, even before the results I guess its belt and braces all the way... (is that the saying?!) So recovery has been ok, not too much pain?  How is your movement in your arm?  I have found this site amazing, though feel bad as just seem to rant on here and get amazing people reply to me - must spend some time looking out for others, as you have. Feeling quite good today, have a day with my daughter tomorrow swimming and a then a tea party so a great distraction for another day.  Thanks again for your reply, I'd love to stay in touch though like you to use me as a sounding post toooooo, please do! Have a nice evening m'dear. Em xx",
