      "Content": "Thanks for replying Ronstar. I did suffer with some joint pain during chemo, but I finished that in early September and haven\u2019t had any until now, but it could still be in my system. I think that you might have a point about exercise though, as I\u2019ve hardly moved over the last few weeks, with Christmas, the cold weather and radiotherapy, which has made me very tired. I might look into Pilates to start off with something gentle, but will have a chat with my gp when I\u2019m next there. I hope your creakyness subsides soon. Take care. ",

Due to the Christmas holidays, my radiotherapy is going to be over 4 weeks. I started Rads again yesterday and had terrible joint aches and pains in my arms and legs, so took myself off to bed at 5.30pm. I can only presume that the joint aches and pains were down to the tamoxifen. Does anybody else get this and what do you take to try to comat this please? Xx",

      "Content": "Sorry Teeshun, that's something that I haven't experienced, just lower back pain from the injections, although I know that chemo does tend to hit your weak spots, which might be the case. I would top up in the pain killers in that case.  I hope you feel better soon xx I was just wondering if any had experienced this: I had my 3rd chemo on Friday and since then I've had pain in my wrist on the same side that the cannula was inserted. It seems slighted swollen, especially if I have my watch on and it's sore when I bend my wrist forward. I never had this with my previous treatments and wondered if anybody knows what this could be please?  Thanks Hides xx",

      "Content": "Good luck for today Emma. I went to the doctors thinking something felt different and was referred for a mammogram, ultrasound and once they looked closer at the lump and thought it was suspicious they did biopsies from my breast and under my arm pit, at the one stop shop so It was all done together on the same day.  They know what they're looking for and if they thinks it's suspicious they'll investigate further. Mine turned out to be Invasive Lobular Breast Cancer and was told on that day that it was highly likely, to be confirmed the following week. I really hope that it turns out to be benign, but if it isn't they'll do everything in their power to get rid of it and get you well. Big hugs xxx",
