    "Content": "Hello Vixsix Sorry to hear onc isn't more forthcoming, it's hard to think of the appropriate questions when your'e sat in a clinic in a state of mild panic. I don't know if it helps but I started with chemo prior to surgery, I've had 3 cycles of FEC - 1 nore next friday then 4 cycles of docataxel (?spelling). I was pleased after the first treatment because the pain in my armpit stopped and my breast felt less sollen but there hasn't been much change since. My onc said that the docataxel would really make the difference so fingers crossed. I understand when you say you expected to feel worse - I imagine the cancer feeling a lot worse than me, bring it on! I think there is plenty of time to feel dreadful as treatment progresses though. I hope you find out more at the scan, you're not neurotic. Take care, Allis xxx",
