      "Content": "Hi there, I was faced with a similar decision except that my hospital paid for an Oncotype DX test which came back with a score of 25 - a score in the grey area which of course is the most difficult in terms of decision making.  I had a 83mm grade 2 lobular cancer hormone receptor positive and had a mastectomy in June.  One oncologist advised me strongly to have chemotherapy and another (actually the more senior) said that the benefit of chemotherapy was debatable in my case. He advised me to have Zylodronic Acid 6 monthly infusions along with Letrazole. I also have had radiotherapy and just finished this treatment. It is an incredibly hard decision to make and different I'm sure for every woman who has to make it. Of course I don't know if I made the right decision but it was the best I could do at the time, weighing up all the odds, all the percentages (and also all the unknown variables!). Advice on this forum really, really helped me in July (there is a thread you could look at from then) as did some very detailed and specific conversations with the doctors about risk. I also recorded the consultations which made it easier to go over them afterwards because I find I can't remember this kind of detail. My very best wishes to you as you deal with this situation. Let us know how it's going. x",

      "Content": "Responding to 'now the treatment is over' - I am coming to the end of my radiotherapy sessions after a mastectomy in June and feeling pretty tired and a bit emotional! I am somewhat surprised that I have not been offered any kind of session with anyone to discuss the end of treatment - I will continue on Letrazole and 6 monthly Zoledronic Acid. I have no idea how the medics will monitor me, I don't have confidence any more in breast self-examination, I feel exhausted and traumatized by the last few months. The psychological and emotional impact will, I feel, take a considerable time to heal and I will seek different kinds of help for this. I am more concerned right now about the way that no-one seems concerned to meet with me and talk through what happens next. The breast care nurses, although lovely, are not exactly proactive in contacting women (probably because they are just inundated and under-staffed) and now I've finished with the surgeons (although I have big dog ears which I am unhappy about and would like to fix in the future) and also the oncologists, no-one seems interested. Who do you think I should contact to talk about this? Thanks. ",

      "Content": "Hi Carolyn, Yes that's pretty much where I am with it at the moment. I did the Predict as well and it said the same thing. The nurse I talked to on the phone said that since it is lobular breast cancer that should be factored in since it can behave unexpectedly and is harder to assess and diagnose at the start - otherwise it would not have been so big! But you know, you get really scared and confused and I'm trying to think through all my likely options and what the medics are going to say to me on Tuesday. One of the things which this diagnosis seems to do is utterly shatter one's perceptions of knowing how your body really is. I knew I was really tired for a while and had actually gone to the GP who did bloods which came back normal and said I was probably Vit D deficient. That among other things......... Thanks for your reply. I have held off from posting on these forums but it is incredibly helpful.  Alice x",

      "Content": "Hi everyone,  I'm new to this group.  I wonder what other women have done when faced with a similar dilemma - three weeks ago I had a mastectomy and the results were clear nodes, lobular cancer grade 2, 83mm and hormone receptive, HER2 neg. I have had a Oncotype DX test and my score is 25. I'm totally confused about what to do and see the oncologist next Tuesday to discuss. I'll be offered radiotherapy and Letrazole and he probably will recommend chemo. I'm 63 and have always been quite fit and healthy. I'm trying to think through benefits vs risks, percentages, all of that and it is driving me crazy right now! It would really helpful to know how others have dealt with this. Thanks.",

      "Content": "I have managed to get a prescription from my GP after she gave me something of a hard time about how there was no evidence base for it being any better than anything else etc... and reluctantly prescribing. The time all this took means that it's delayed and I won't get it till after my radiotherapy starts next week. I don't think I will mention it at the hospital on Tuesday. I also wonder if she has given me enough. She was clear the prescription was a one off! I also have some udder cream which I saw recommended but am now confused about if you should start using this before treatment starts. ",

I have the feeling it was not the combination pack but some lesser rather paltry amount but I can't quite remember because my brain isn't functioning how I am used to (...). I'll let you know, should be about thursday this week.  And yes, the new normal, well, who knows what that's going to look like x",

      "Content": "Hi, I\u2019ve been taking Letrazole for 8 months now and have had trouble with my vision pretty much since the start. I get blurred vision, much worse dry eyes than I had before, the feeling of grit in my eyes and I just had an eye test and the ophthalmologist said I have the beginnings of cataracts. I\u2019ve read that visual disturbances (and cataracts) can be linked to Letrazole. For me, a huge reader and someone who\u2019s on the laptop several hours a day, this feels quite devastating potentially and I wonder if anyone else has the same thing and if so, what you did about it!? Thanks. ",

      "Content": "Hi Cardbond, Yes! I went to my GP January 2016 complaining of constant tiredness. This followed months of a great deal of stress admittedly (bereavement) but even so, I felt strange and so exhausted in a way that was different from the kind of tiredness you get from anxiety or depression. Bloods came back ok. But then I was diagnosed following a routine mammogram in May 2016. I had lobular cancer and I couldn't feel a lump but the medics thought I could have had it for a year (or some said more). I did some research and it seems that this is a common complaint of women prior to a breast cancer diagnosis. Now, following mastectomy, radiotherapy and continuing Letrazole, although I am very tired a lot of the time, as a result of the trauma and also of course the hormones, it is a totally different feeling somehow. I wish GPs took women complaining of tiredness more seriously. But then I guess a lot of women are tired a lot of the time!!! But they should check and at least do a breast exam I think. ",
