      "Content": "Hi there! I was diagnosed with DCIS in February but knew my course of action would be a bilateral mastectomy, I just knew this was the way to go for me. My consultant was amazing and asked me to go for an MRI.......he told me he didn't like surprises! Just as well, the MRI showed cancer in the other breast (he was surprised)! So for me and him, it was for the best. Letrozole for 5 years, no rads or chemo. Decided also to go for hysterectomy as a preventative, again, surgeons all had my back and didn't question me at all. I have still a lot of questions to ask as far as MRI, CT etc., I do know my sister had a CT scan but her cancer had progressed. I believe with DCIS, if it is contained and nodes are clear and mastectomy has taken place then all is good, however, as G n J said, nothing is guaranteed. Nothing at all. I haven't helped with PET scans at all and I'm sorry for that. Like me, you sound like you need to know what's going on, when and why.....I hope you get your list ready like I will when I go back. Love J xx",

      "Content": "Hey Hayley, can I ask what the 1962 is please? That's a good year! Your consultant is correct, recover from both surgeries and recover well, before you go ahead with anything else. My hysterectomy was only a month ago and mastectomies at the beginning of May, I bounce back and recover well, however I'm feeling this one......foggy head, forgetting words (maybe that's natural anyway for my age!!). My mind was made up before I had my MRI, that both breasts were coming off because I just knew they were better gone to give me peace of mind really and to know that I have done everything that I, ME, MYSELF and in control, have done everything to make sure that I'm here for a while yet. Even if it is to terrorise my youngest daughter (just turned 20 yesterday but I swear she thinks she's my age!). Make sure you do what's right for YOU please and keep your family involved. I have friends who thought I was extreme with bilateral and then on the back of that hysterectomy, I don't see them anymore. As far as I was concerned, I was just trying to save my life. I love my life and enjoy it and I want to be here for as long as possible, I think you do too. Hope I haven't been too \"in your face\"! Remember, ask, ask and better ask xx",

      "Content": "Hi everyone, not been here for a long time! How peculiar is this?.........hubby and I have just arrived home from a wee holiday today and as we were going through a security check at Schippol (he always gets stopped!), he never this time but however, I did, much to his amusement! Security was indeed, one of those stand-in, x-ray jobs. \"Excuse me madam\" I hear as I gaily walk off to collect my belongings, \"can you come back, stand on these footprints and raise your arms\"?  I did as I was told, immediately took as I call them now, not a hot flush but a 'volcanic eruption'! This is what I was wearing: a non-wired bra, cotton shirt, knickers and cotton trousers.....barefooted and no jewellery. The lady who was elected to pat me down, was quite tall and it has to be said that I'm a tad vertically challenged, so I immediately started with the nervous giggling!  The lady started at the ankles and worked her way up and as she got up to my back, had a good feel at the bra clip, worked her way around to the front and then proceeded to place her hands on my boobs (immediate reconstructive implants), felt round the implants. \"Ah! I'm sorry, you have treatment for cancer?\" \"Em......yup! How do you know?\" says I. \"Look\" she says pointing to the thingy that must alert them.  Well, this is the very interesting part and sorry for babbling on.............the x-ray of my back showed yellow on my right upper back and on the front side showed completely yellow on what would be my breast area. I had a bilateral mastecomy with reconstruction on 29/4/14. While in there, the nodes on the right side were tested because that side is where they found the original cancer and fortunately all was clear and no further treatment, apart from exemestane, was needed. I can only assume here, but has the dye that has to be injected into the body to highlight infected nodes/areas have something in it which is picked up by the airport body scanners? As I said, been a while but good to be back. Look after yourselves and PS, hubby now calm! Joy xxx  ",

      "Content": "Hi Hayley, I was diagnosed in Feb this year through a routine mammogram with DCIS in one breast. Family history but I always knew if it happened to me what course I would take and that was a bilateral mastectomy. Good decision for me as DCIS in other breast also ( the right breast on pathology showed my DCIS was invasive but caught in time) Both DCIS were caught very early and no evidence of cancer in nodes. I also chose to have my nipples removed as there was a 3% chance of cancer coming back through nipple tissue against 1% of it coming back if they were removed......no brainier as far as I was concerned!!! However, after all that waffling.......because the cancer was caught early and I'm oestrogen receptive, I'm taking Letrozole to stomp out the oestrogen fire and also because it was caught early and my choice of treatment, no radiotherapy or chemo was required but there is no absolute guarantee. Hope this helps and again, sorry for waffling xx",

      "Content": "Good evening ladies! Hmmm! Had my double mx end of April after being diagnosed with early stage cancer, MRI discovered it in both breasts. Genetic testing revealed BRCA2 gene. To keep safe, have opted for full hysterectomy (dodgy cells have been there for a while anyway) and I want it, I really do. Surprise phone call this morning from hospital to go in on Thursday and I don't know why but I feel a bit nervous about this one. I haven't even had my nipple reconstruction or tattoo yet!!! Maybe it's that......the first event hasn't been wrapped up yet! Ah well! And I REALLY don't like Letrozole. AND because I had to stop my college course early because of mastectomy op, I'm trying to get all my paperwork finished tonight and tomorrow! I will get qualified dammit! Ok, rant over! Sorry! Sending love and thoughts to all xx",

I'm a late starter with this at 51, but am loving it - just wish I had started it years ago when I looked into it! Classmates all a bit envious because I've had loads of time to study! The down side is, I lost a lot of time not being able to physically do the treatments......just started again in the last couple of weeks and have to stop again for a wee while! It's nice doing something that you really enjoy isn't it? Keep well and take care.......Joy xx",
