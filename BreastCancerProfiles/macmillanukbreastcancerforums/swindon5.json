      "Content": "Hi Jodie, Hope that it all went well and was not as bad as you expected. I had my mastectomy last Wednesday with an immediate reconstruction using my Latissimuss Dorsi muscle only and it was not as bad as I had thought it was going to be. I came home from hospital yesterday and will have my follow up with the plastic surgeon on Wednesday. Look forward to your post when you get home. Take care and rest with plenty of hugs from us all on this site.",

      "Content": "Hi all, I had to ask for this when I first started on Letrozole and it took nine months before I got an appointment. I am now due for another one two years later and this one has only taken one month to come through and my appointment is for tomorrow. Was all normal at the last one and hoping the same results this time. I think that a year is a rather long time for you to be on a waiting list as you only have to wait 24 weeks for surgeries, etc. and as this is something that I believe needs to be done is rather ridiculous. I did my appointment through my Oncologist, although it is my GP that gets the results sent to them. Sharon",

      "Content": "I am due my mastectomy on the 1st October with an immediate reconstruction using the back muscle. My plastic surgeon recommended the genie bra. It does not have any clips and is very stretchy. It is similar to a sports bra. I have practiced putting it on one handed by stepping in to it and it is relatively easy. I have also got some mastectomy bras from M & S, some even have matching knickers. Good luck with the rest of your treatment.",

      "Content": "I found a lump in my right breast in 2007, aged 40, the lump could be felt by hand. I was sent for a mammogram and a sonogram. Prior to the mammogram being taken I had a metal marker put on the lump, the only thing that showed up on the mammogram was the metal marker, there was no sign of the lump. After then having a sonogram done, found lump which then had to be biopsied and ended up being cancerous. Depending on your age and the density of your breast tissue was a reason I was given for it not being seen.",

      "Content": "Hi Maddog, I was diagnosed in 2006 whilst in America, so my treatment may vary from the treatment here in the UK. I was diagnosed in November 2006 with IDC grade 2, ER positive, HER 2 negative. This was followed by lumpectomy in December 2006 where they took out eleven nodes and two were positive. I then started chemotherapy 28th December 2006 which was AC x4 followed by Docetaxel x4, these were done every two weeks. That was followed by radiotherapy and then five years on Tamoxifen. I was working as a supply teacher whilst in the USA and I tended to work on the Monday and Tuesday, played golf on the Wednesday during the day and football in the evening and then had my chemo on the Thursday and have Friday off from working. Then I played football on the weekend. I found that if I focussed on keeping everything going as normal then I would get through it.Â  The children that I worked with were mainly aged around three and four, so nothing too strenuous was done throughout the day and they napped for an hour after lunch. I only had one side effect during all my treatment which was to lose my hair - but I did manage to keep my eyelashes and eyebrows. I apparently also have the right shaped head for having no hair. I also focussed on my five year old boy which helped a lot. Hope it all goes well. Let us all know how it went.",
