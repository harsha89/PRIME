      "Content": "Well I am technically supposed to be having my second cycle of EC tomorrow but two days ago had serious chills and shivering (no fever) and woke up with my surgical site completely swollen. I had a mastectomy with implant reconstruction back in early March. I went for an ultrasound and they drained loads of fluid off and now am on antibiotics for two weeks.  It came on so suddenly. I was feeling great up to that point. Has anyone still gone ahead with their scheduled chemo while on antibiotics? Kx",

      "Content": "Hi everyone  Well I had my first cycle of EC last Friday and it hit me hard. I have never felt so ill and exhausted in my life. I now have some energy back and am eating more but I can\u2019t shake this foggy brain feeling. I feel like I have no clarity. Is that normal? Does it lift?  I cannot stomach coffee now and I normally drank loads in a day so wondering if it\u2019s caffeine withdrawal. Already nervous for the second cycle as now I know what I\u2019m in for",
