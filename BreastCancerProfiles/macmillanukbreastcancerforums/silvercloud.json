He talked through all of my results and put my mind at rest about the decisions to be made. Feel a bit lost as now not seeing him for 4 months when we will discuss reconstruction. He has been easy to talk through during this horrendous process and I feel like I am starting again now with the oncologist whom I don't feel comfortable with. Maybe that will change with the appointment I have with him next Tuesday.   Feeling remarkably calm and quiet - something I have never been! I am determined to get through all this as it is the best chance I have of getting over all this, but not sure I will cope. My new motto is to take one day at a time",

He has told me I can go on holiday first (we have one booked at the end of May) and says there is no risk in me delaying the start. I feel remarkably calm about what is to come largely due to the fact that for the first time in 3 months everything is clear. Waiting for my start date but feel I know have a couple of weeks to get prepared and then a week to have fun with all my family before it starts.  Dash - I have said I will take each step as it comes. My mother-in-law had leukaemia 12 years ago and only had 2 of 6 cycles of chemo as it made her so ill. They gave her 12 months and 12 years on is fitter and healthier than all of us! Good luck with the rads. Funda - they were going to do the Oncotype test but as I am HER2 positive it became irrelevant. I know now chemo is the right way to go ( I was subconsciously leaning that way anyway). I want to do all I can to prevent this Happening again. As a family we have had a rough 3 months and while I would like to move on, I think this is the way to try and prevent it happening again. It is 5 months but hopefully a nice summer will allow us to have lots of fun with the paddling pool in the garden and me sleeping in the shade on a sun lounger!!!!

I saw the oncologist today and even more confused.  My surgical consultant said that they highly recommended chemo and that if I were his wife he would tell her to have it. The oncologist today seemed very laid back and said it was my decision. He said I need to decide and used the predict tool. The five year stats were 90% and chemo added another 2.6%, the ten to year stats were 75% and chemo added another 7%. He gave me no guidance other than to say I was young (43) with young children and I think he was thinking I should go for chemo. I should have asked straight out but didn't think to! We are still waiting for the HER2 result on the second tumour but they are fairly positive it will be negative. Once this has come back, he has said he would get them to send off for the Oncotype dx test.  So the really ridiculous thing is, I am now thinking I should be taking the chemo to make sure all is covered and that I will forever be worried if the test comes back low and I can't have it. I don't want to have chemo but I am worried that it will come back if I don't. Logic says the Oncotype is a far better tool to use than the stats but I seem to have lost all sense! ",

Looked up Eden Hazard - there are far worse hair cuts out there!!!! Just one of the many things to contend with on this journey.  Karen - good luck with the other with the other oncologist. I'm sure mine will be okay on Tuesday. I'm relieved that all the tests are done now and it's now treatment. Right from my diagnosis in mid Feb I have had conflicting test results and been waiting for results to come back. Whilst I was upset at the HER2 result, I am relieved that the waiting is over. I was thinking of trying to delay the start as we have a family holiday booked for half term but I am now thinking I just want to get this started. I am amazed at just how strong we can be xxxx",

I feel very alone in all this and it is just too hard. My husband is trying to help me through this but he can't make the decision. I feel like I have been abandoned when I most needed to be guided. I wish I had asked the oncologist outright what he thought I should do but I'm not sure I would have got an answer even then. I feel like I messed the whole appointment up and now have 3 weeks before I see him again. I am frightened of chemo and all that it entails. I'm scared how it will impact all our lives and whether I can cope with the whole process. But, I am also scared that this could all happen again and that if I don't have the chemo I will spend my life waiting for this to happen again. I don't know that I can live with that.",

Am I mad thinking about having all those people in my house day 13 after chemo no 4? I feel fine but now worried about picking up bugs!! My mum has offered to do it at hers.  I've not worried about things like this at all during the chemo but the oncologists have now started talking about radiotherapy again after dismissing it and I got an appointment through yesterday to see my surgical consultant next week. It is after I had an ultrasound scan on my implant and my oncologist has asked him to see me. The radiographer said the implant was fine but I am now worried it is something else and that has thrown me completely.  This party all seems ridiculously petty now but I need to make a decision and my brain seems to have seized.

Royce also do a lot of bras online..They also do a service where you if you need pockets in one of their bras that is not specifically a mastectomy one, they can sew them in for you once you have bought and tried it on for size.

I am going to ask him what all these numbers mean and why they think I should have chemo. I think I want to know my prognosis as well. I am guessing that they will got through the treatment plan etc? I think I may see the oncology nurse as well but don't know I also want to find out about the cold cap - although I'm not sure if I can cope with that as well.

I sat them down and explain that I had cancer and that it was some body cells that had gone bad. I explained that I was being looked after by great doctors and that they would take the cells away in an. Operation.  I decided to be upfront with them and encouraged them to ask questions. I didnt want them to hear us or other people talk about it all and misunderstand.  Breastcancercare website has a good section on talking to children that may help.  www.breastcancercare.org.uk/talking-children-about-breast-cancer They will go through lots of emotions and in our family it has been a mixture of helpfulness, constantly checking me, frustration, tears, long chats late at night and making mummy laugh! I also went and spoke to my children's headteacher. She has told them there is always someone to talk to, something my 8 year old daughter has used. My 10 year old son tends to process things in his head for a while before speaking out (10 pm usually!)  I hope this helps in some small way.
