    "Content": "Hi I-mouse,  this must be a very trying time for you.  I see your post is a month old so I imagine you may well have decided about your reconstruction and possibly even have had it done, so apologies if this is a little late!  I was diagnosed with a malignant phyllodes tumour at the end of July and had a mastectomy and DIEP reconstruction at the same time.  My reasons for choosing this type of reconstruction over an implant were that it would use all my own tissue for the reconstruction so nothing 'alien' being put into my body, there was less chance of having to have further surgery later on to remove ruptured implants or anything else that could go wrong with them, the reconstructed breast would put on and lose weight (fat) along with the rest of my body so wouldn't look different and it would give the most natural look and soft feel.  These were obviously only my personal reasons and everyone's reasons for choosing the different types of reconstruction are different and all perfectly valid.  I am now 7 weeks post op and I am very pleased with the look and feel of my new breast.  It is still early days but I do believe I made the right decision, for me.  Having a phyllodes tumour can be very overwhelming not least of all because there is not a lot of information 'out there' and even a lot of the medical profession that I have seen over the last few months have not even heard of it.  I really do empathise with the situation you are in and I wish you all the luck in the world for the journey you are embarking upon!",
