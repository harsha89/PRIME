      "Content": "Hi has anyone ever had a CT scan without the contrast dye. I had this scan yesterday but due to collapsed, damaged veins they were unable to inject the dye and then decided to do the scan without. I am now panicking that it wont be as effective. I will be going back end of the week but I just wondered if anyone else has had similar problems and if there are any radiologists on this site I would love to hear from you :-) Thank you x",

      "Content": "Thank you Mistymoley and Dorothee for your responses. I am probably the world worse worrier so my mind goes into overdrive when i am under pressure like this. I just want everything to be done properly and they not to miss a thing. They are needing to check the cancer hasnt spread to organs etc hence why I was concerned they wouldnt be able to see these as clearly. I am hopefully seeing the oncologist tomorrow again so I will ask the question again. Thanks again and all the best to you xx",
