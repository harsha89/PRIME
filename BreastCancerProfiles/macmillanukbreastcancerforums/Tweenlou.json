      "Content": "Hi, I was diagnosed with breast cancer before Christmas. I have always been positive and even thrown a farewell to my left boob party, it\u2019s just my way!!!  My results have come back ok but may still need chemotherapy & radiotherapy. I had a skin sparing mastectomy & reconstruction 2 weeks ago. I  went to my check up yesterday and was told skin doesn\u2019t look to good and my implant may have to be removed and also more skin tomorrow. Feeling gutted is an understatement as having the implant fitted is what\u2019s kept me going so I still kind of look normal in my eyes!!! ",
