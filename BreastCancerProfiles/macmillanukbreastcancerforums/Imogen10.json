      "Content": "Hi, I was diagnosed with primary breast cancer in September 2011 aged 35. I had a mastectomy, chemo and radiotherapy followed by reconstructive surgery in 2013 and I have been on tamoxifen for 5 years.  All was good until a year ago I started having pains in my left leg, went to the doctors several times but told it was nothing to worry about! Finally this July one doctor took me seriously and sent me for a bone scan, sadly the results were not what we were expecting and my cancer has returned in my bones. They have confirmed left leg, one rib, spine, pelvis and font left skull, I am still awaiting a CT scan to fingers cross confirm not spread to organs.  I have started monthly zoladex injections already and will start denosumba this coming Wednesday. As you can imagine my head is all over the place at the moment but trying to remain positive. Please can anyone share their experiences with me and how long they have been living with cancer.  Thank in advance  Claire ",
