    "Content": "My kids are 8 and 11. Until recently we had told them very little as I had had loads of ops, but everything was progressing very slowly (my primary was in 1988, recurrence in 2004). Now we are gradually telling the 11 year old more, but I don't think anything I've said to the 8 year old has gone in, so I leave it at that. We talk a little to the 11 year old about what is happening, but not the likelihoods of what will happen in the future. I think I should say more, but that is as much as I can deal with. We can't all do it perfectly, even for our kids. Alison",
