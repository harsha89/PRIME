      "Content": "Hi I am new to this group and just wondered if anyone has any advice.  I have lumpectomy and node removal in May, then had more surgery to clean an infection in the lymph node site.  Since then I have been doing the exercises and have good mobility in my arm but it is very sore and feels really tight below my elbow on the inner arm extending to my hand.  Any ideas??  ",
