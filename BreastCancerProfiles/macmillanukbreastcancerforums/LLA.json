      "Content": "Hi. Thanks for the info.  I've decided to do it and have surgery booked for next tues (24th). Scared but have decided best option for me to move forward. Gyn consultant mentioned changing tamoxifen to letrozole but bc team said stick with tamoxifen as letrozole not good for bones. I've seen gp who will prescribe vit d and calcuim supplements. She also mentioned taking something else but brain fade on what she called it. Assume this is what everyone is taking/doing? xx",

      "Content": "Hello, I'm new!  My mum died at 46 of secondary breast cancer (17 years ago) and unfortunately I was diagnosed on Christmas Eve 2014 with grade 2 ER+ breast cancer. I opted for a double mastectomy. Recovered physically well from this but emotionally, the fear and not knowing if its going to come back eats at me day and night! My mum's bc spread so why shouldn't mine? I've heard all the doctors logic...caught early (I was having screening) paid for an Onco DX report (result 7 - low reoccurrence risk) Head can't move on. I've now had genetic testing done and its come back that I don't have a known gene fault. Last week I saw a gyn. oncologist recommended by my genetic team who has spoken about doing a Oophorectomy (had to look up how to spell it, let alone type it, its ovary and fallopian tube removal) Has anyone had this done as a precaution for the future? I'm going around in circles about if it its the right thing to do. It will put me in the menopause instantly at aged 40. I've had my children so fertility isn't my concern its the effects the early menopause will bring: Osteoporosis, heart disease versus having lower oestrogen levels re the breast cancer. I'm taking Tamoxifen. Was hell to start with but gradually I've improved with it. Can anyone help me with Oophorectomy road?",
