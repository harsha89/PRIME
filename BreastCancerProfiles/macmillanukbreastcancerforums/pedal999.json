    "Content": "When I was diagnosed in August this year, I asked a friend (and pancreatic cancer survivor, and \"in my family of choice\") how she had found people around her react.. She said there was a whole range, and you get a skill at working out whether they are the type that show compassion / empathy genuinely, or whether they are more motivated by self-interest, or just shut down and refuse to talk..  and that the skill you gain helps keep you safe from the potential toxic friendships / relationships from some existing contacts.. My (step)-daughter hasn't asked me how I am since I came home from hospital 10 weeks ago, and as far as I'm aware doesn't even know I'm not having chemo, but now need radiotherapy. My sister (also diagnosed with BC in July 2014) has only texted me about 5 times since then, and not initiated any phoe calls.. My partner became very needy after my diagnosis and even ended up having eight weeks off sick due to the stress of me having cancer!!  - Trouble is then with her at home she was very hostile, and not conducive to my being in a calm and stress free environment to recover.. So, my heart  goes out to you..   I wish everyone could respond to their loved ones with cancer in the most caring and appropriate way, but sadly the world isn't like that, and some people are not able to control their own impulses / emotions..   Sadly we can't change them, but can adapt ourselves to ensure we are safe and distance ourselves from any toxic relationships..    Hugs",
