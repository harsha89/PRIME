      "Content": "Hi chellesimo. What brand of letrezole are you on?  I have been taking it for about 9 months and have had some very painful side effects in my joints along with extreme tiredness. I have tried 3 brands, cipla and tiva that have been nasty and caused problems,  I have now, after many appointments at the doctors been on the sandoz brand and even though there is still stiffness it is no where near as painful and I can walk without limping with the pain.
