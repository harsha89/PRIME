      "Content": "Hi I realise none of you may now be looking at this site as it is some time since you posted these messages however I had right mastectomy with immediate reconstruction in Dec 09 and because i was so small i had the left one augmented. While I am thrilled with the left one now - only went to 34b as so little to work with - thats not the case with the recon. As the lady who started this thread did I too had the implant placed under the chest muscle and at first it looked fine. However I am now ending the 3 month recovery period and now undergoing chemo and it is just not right. It looks quite misshapen esp compared to the left one. I know they will never look the same but it has changed so much and is also uncomfortable and distorts when i do anything. I was just wondering what the outcome was for the first lady - sorry I have forgotten your name even tho I only just logged on, blame the chemo!! I dont have to have radio thankfully so I dont have to face the prospect of that doing further harm. Be grateful if anyone has anything they can tell me Bev x",

However you are right about the importance of Vit D levels - my hospital - St Georges- did a lot of research on the subject and it is really vital as a preventative. I am hoping to be able to get it again but my GP has warned me its hard to get hold of so its not a definite. I only got it in the first place as I cant tolerate it orally unfortunately - get really upset tummy which is common apparently too. And annoying in our case!! To be honest I cant recall what my levels were as memory just hasnt stored the info lol xx  ",

The doctor i saw today was lovely and is going to add some more anti sick/nausea tablets in the mix tomorrow, just in case. She says the depression bit is part steroids and part psychological. My Lovely Macmillan nurse suggests definitley going to one of the therapy centres - my nearest is the Haven in Fulham so am going to try and get along there next week. She says they show you relaxation treatments - apparently I am suffering Anticipatory Reluctance!! I think thats a fancy name for dread lol!! Anyway - we think they still do the Look Good Feel Good there so will try and book in for that too. Something nice to look forward to eh? Bit worried about my bloods cos I have had slight cold and the doctor said today that can upset your white cell count. I do hope not - although I dont want the chemo tomorrow I also do not want any delays so hope they are ok. BTW - re weddings - my Macm nurse said that although I should be fine to go to my daughters in June she said we will be really tired by the end and has advised me to do nothing up to the service - 4.30pm for us - then go to reception but try and find somewhere for a rest as she reckons by 8.30 I will be completely shattered. I really hope adrenaline will kick in a bit and keep me going but will probably take her advice and have a break at some point.  You will luckily have a couple more weeks after last dose to get it out of your systme more and start to feel more \"normal\" - whatever that will be now! I hope your appointments have gone well - speak soon - onward and upward eh???   Bev x",

      "Content": "Hello Cherub43 and evryone - esp Katie53 who is due number 3 today - Good Luck!!! I had number 3 yesterday - was surprised my bloods were ok as had a cold on and off through low stage and good week. It looks like one part of my body is working well then lol!!! Got my usual dizzy/light headed/fizzy nose at the end of the \"F\" drug and a little nauseous at the C stage - think that was because I only had cereal and toast before I got to hospital and then had to wait around for an hour and a half as they were short staffed. The nurse got me a sandwich and that helped - so always eat before having it!! I almost wish I didnt want to eat Cherub43 then the weight gain might not be a problem. But on the other hand i think it helps with staving off the nausea so am just going to be more careful what i eat this time to try and minimise weight  gain. Since having my mastectomy I have put on 4kgs - doesnt help that my hubby keeps buying me treats and friends arrive with chocs!! I am going to put a stop to all that!! One thing I have noticed is that someone advised eating ice lollies as helps with the nasty taste and spongy mouth - well I had one last night and it also took the edge off nausea - double whammy!! Will keep freezer well stocked. I have also bought Corsodyl Daily Care toothpaste as I read this may help - keeps gums firm and strong - I have been told chemo can affect teeth due to gums - anything that can help i will try! It does have a funny taste - bit like the mouthwash at the dentist - but not the worse thing  in the world Anyway - so far today I feel good - I am going to take myself for a walk over the common to feed the ducks shortly. Have a good day everyone Bev x",

I tend to be a bit ostrich about it  - head in the sand and will come up when its all over lol!! When i get the last drug - think its the F one i get very lightheaded and my nose sort of goes fizzy and weird - well i have had this since Wed - had chemo Tues - has anyone else had this side effect - it gives you a strange head achey feeling too! Am eating a Calippo lolly while typing to help with nasty taste and spongy mouth feeling - helps short term!! I have put off the hol ins poser!! My daughter is getting married in June in Cyprus and i am going to face it i suppose - all i keep thinking is that we have our EHIC card for free med treatment in Europe so is it worth it - a friend with BC didnt bother as it was so expensive. I have travel ins with my bank account and if i mention it thats it the rest will be void - will mull over!! planning a holiday is good tho eh? take care B x",

I work in a GP practice so a veritable breeding ground for catching bugs. As such my bosses advised I stay away - this is mainly because my youngest is getting married in June and as my last cycle is due on 4th May we are keen to keep me on track. They have been brilliant and have kept me on full pay so far howver this will go t half pay from next month. I have been able to do some work from home and have to say on week  3 when i feel great i am gagging to get back. But that said when my mid afternoon tiredness hits i am glad to be able to pop up to bed for a while. Dont push yourself - if you need to be home and resting then listen to your body. Take care xx",

Apparently taxotere is the one responsible for nail loss although us ladies on FEC only may experience cuticle problems - mine have gone dry and raggy so I have been keeping well moisturised with Liz Earle Superbalm - they may also discolour. But with luck we should keep them - I was told if they havent gone now its unlikely they will and number 4 tomorrow. She is going to prescribe me some eye drops as she says once eyelashes completely gone my eyes may become sore so this is preventative measure. They are thinning and short but enough there to use mascara on if I want to !! Andrea - good luck for your first tomorrow - will think of you! Katie - ggod luck with number 4 on Wednesday - hope it goes ahead as planned - I didnt put on any weight this time - phew! - now just need to lose a bit in time for wedding - will worry about that later I think. Thanks again to you all for continuing threads - its reassuring to read - and I agree - not all of us on here are having a bad time - so far it has been nothing like as bad as i feared but I am SO glad I found this as a support network - it has been invaluable.

However now the swelling has gone down the recon is slightly smaller than the new left one! I too am thinking am i going to have to have more surgery? Am thinking not yet - want a break from hospitals when chemo is done. I have spoken to a couple of ladies who have had immediate recon and they all agree the chemo does have an effect on the surgery - even my Macm nurse said it will affect it. But this should ease off after chemo done. I will wait and see i think. Where i was very small before and have now gone bit bigger I have a puckering at the side but have been told this is chest muscle - doesnt look very good but am trying to ignore it for now - as you say no-one can see it ! My hubby has been brill throughout and has said from the start it looks great - bless him!!

Dont know what that means for me and am waiting for my Macm nurse to ring me back so I can ask her. I hate ringing the oncology ward for advice - feel like a whinger - suppose that comes from working in a doctors and not wanting to waste doctors time. I have also bought a dress but not sure its going to fit either - I eat like a horse all the time - people are amazed when they see me tuck in - even when i am nauseous - i find food does help to alleviate it. I am going to try the icelolly plan to see if that helps cos i hate the nasty taste/spongy feeling. Is anyone else as tearful as me and do you think its the steroids - they have def not made me hyper - total opposite in fact. Cant speak without blubbing.

I think I will paint nails today as precautionary measure tho I am wondering if it has anything to do with peripheral neuropathy - the nerve endings in fingers and toes go \"dead\" feeling and I did notice that last night after being on laptop for quite a while the nails on the fingers i used for typing - or playing games!! - \"ached\". Maybe if the nerve endings die off a bit that affects the nail too. Am definitely going to mention to oncologist on Monday. I have to say I find that more freaky than eyelash loss so am hoping to avoid that little joy! Woohoo - a tool fair - sounds great fun. Although I just like it when I go anywhere other than St Georges Hospital - that seems the sum total of our social life at the moment!! Have a good day Bev xxx",

      "Content": "Hi sarah I had my reconstruction in December - implant (silicone) behind chest muscle, no lymph node removal necessary thankfully. I also do not need radiotherapy so thats another plus. The thing is is that now it seems to distort when i do anything - probably the unfortunate thing about it being on the right and i am right handed -so will do more on that side and make it more obvious whats happening. It is definitley smaller than the left side now that the swelling has gone done and seems to have settled into a odd shape too. Its quite soft to touch but \"feels\" tense - feels as in I am aware of a tense feeling. This has got worse since chemo started. I spoke to macmillan nurse and she said this can happen and chemo can affect the implant. I had the left side made slighly bigger and that too is more uncomfortable at times - it gave me no problems at all since surgery and only since chemo has it. I know I was told in the surgery clinic that i wouldnt be seen there again until after the chemo and also its not quite 3 months yet since surgery but i think when i go for next pre-chemo appointment i will ask if its possible to get it looked at. Funnily enough when i saw the surgeon to have dressings removed he said he considered putting in an expandable one and i wish now he had as it would have been easier to then balance me up!! I was glad not to have to have the muscle op as I think that would have been a lot more to recover from - my surgery took 6+ hours as  it was - probably because of the augmentation. I suppose the only answer will be to have another implant at some stage to go up a bit. I think if thats the answer I will give it a while - I am so looking forward not to going for hospital appointments every week/fortnight etc etc!!! As it is the prospect of new bra shopping beckons and I guess i will just buy the ones with the removable pads in for now and take it out on the left and leave on the right to balance me. From a sensation point of view I have noticed agradual increasing but very slight - I can just about tell when i touch the scar now and although people have told me that eventually you get some feeling back I cant imagine that this side will ever have a huge part to play in my personal life if you get my drift. Anyway - thank you for replying and i hope tomorrow goes well - you are about 10 days ahead of me so i will be interested to know if any new side effects pop up this time or if current ones get worse. I had my first nose bleed today - very slight but another little joy!! Also got my wig today - hmmmmm not sure about that:) Bev x",

Am definitely going to have to hit the salads! Its just so cold out that it doesnt inspire you does it?? Thanks to everyone with alll their feedback - especially the diet/supplements - I did not know about the Actimel - have had a couple but will stop now - I expect its the same with the Activia yoghurts then too.

      "Content": "Hi Oldhat I wish I knew - my name gives my age away lol!! I had a hysterectomy 3 years ago and was put on HRT cos I was \"young\" - on it for 3 years when noticed nipple change - never did feel any of the 3 lumps i had and i was only 34AA bra size so I always thought I would notice anything like that. Anyway ended up with mastectomy with immediate reconstruction and augmentation to left breast - surgeon said he could in no way do a recon as small as my original boobs - nice!! I couldnt face just the mastectomy so went ahead with all of it. None of my lymph nodes were affected and the lumps ranged from 1.7 to .4cm. I am HER negative and hormone positive - and had invasive lobular cancer. The surgeon was absolutley confident that by doing the mastectomy that all cancer had gone. However the oncology team advised chemo in case there were any stary cells - tiny risk but in the end i went with it because apparently if you dont and it comes back its then a secondary and can only be treated as opposed to cured - so here we are. But I have no idea why we all get different cocktails - I prefer the ones served in the Hard Rock Cafe myself!!! I guess age and type of cancer does make the difference. When they gave me the leaflet to read re FEC it said its usually given in 4 or 6 cycles and I did ask why if its only a preventative insurance measure that i need 6 goes and was told that they now say 6 to 8 with 6 as the Gold Standard - whoop whoop that made it soooo much better lol! I have to say I have worked for GP's for 15 years and had no idea there were so many different types and treatments for this - it has certainly been an eye opener. Well i am just coming up to what we call \"infection week\" where i am extra careful - so am going shopping today - went for a walk yesterday and was like a new born kitten after 15 mins so not sure how much shopping will actually get done!!

      "Content": "Hello Ladies Oldhat - so sorry about your opera trip - its so annoying - i am keeping everything crossed that my bloods keep being good to me - my daughters wedding in Cyprus is one month after scheduled last dose and I will be good to go if they stay on track - if they dont - well i cant think of that! Although my oncologist did say if need be they would delay the final cycle so i was ok to go. But would really like to have this behind me by the time the wedding comes around. Its weird isnt it - we dread each cycle but are down when we get the delay! I was thinking about how our brain perceives time depending on good or bad things. My surgery was 3 months ago and I have been looking forward to that milestone as I have been strapped into sports bras 24/7 and can now wear normal bras. But that seems to have taken an age to get here but the chemo 3 week cycle seems to race along - is it because waiting for good stuff seems to take longer to get here than the not so good??!! Jodie - welcome to our ramblings! I hope you find this as invaluable as we do. Katie - i am pleased you are not finding no.3 so bad - I too have found this one slighly easier. I think knowing whats to come has made it easier to cope with. I am not panicking about every little side effect now. The nasty taste seems worse this time - more prolonged, but on the whole its not been too bad. What will 4 bring i wonder? I have booked myself an induction day at The Haven for Tuesday so that is somehing nice to look forward to and am hopefully going again on 6/4 for the Looking Good Feeling Better session - makeup and hair advice and free goodie bag!! I do think little treats are important to us at this time - we definitley deserve it! I found a website with some very funny slogan TShirts and hats on - cafepress.co.uk I think it is. I am doing the Race for Life on 18/7 - amazing as have never done anything like it before - and am thinking of getting something to wear then - some great chemo related ones :) Well girls - enjoy Mothers Day however you spend it - bizarrely I am popping into my work that morning to do something for them although I am signed off  till this little adventure is over. Am quite looking forward to it actually - normality!! Love to you all Bev xx",

Real mixed feelings - want it over but not looking forward to feeling rough again. Also wondering if i will get double whammy as this time wasnt so bad - hmmm a case of wait and see and positive thinking!

Has anyone else found the peripheral neuropathy gets worse- and does it go away when you have finished - sometimes i can barely type cos my fingers are both numb and tingly! My toes are starting to get worse too. None of it is unbearable but very annoying!! Well the freezer is stocked with lollies, I will ask about B vitamins supplemts Katrina - thank you.

      "Content": "Hi Cherub43 I asked oncologist about  what happens after FEC and she said I will see them for end of treatment appointment and then get prescribed Tamoxifen or equivalent - my cancer is hormone receptive so they have to now get rid of all the oestrogen in my body. I had a hysterectomy 3 years agao and ovaries removed so at least I am no longer producing it in that way so guess that will help. I did take HRT on advise of gynae team at the time - to prevent osteoporosis! - I did ask if the HRT caused the Cancer but told i wasnt on it long enough for that to be the cause! Anyway after that i get referred back to surgical team to review the mastectomy and what i may want to do with that - nipple tattoo etc, then follow up mammograms to keep an eye on healthy breast and thats it. I asked if we were offered other scans - liver or whatever to be sure there was nothing lurking but she told me that would serve no purpose other than to raise our stress levels. I dont know that i am fully convinced to be honest on that one - I didnt know i had this cancer - so how will i know if i have another one?? Anyway i will raise that again at my last appontment - I know I will have another echo to check heart but i think we all get that. Are you having chemo then before any surgery?? What are you having and when?? Have been looking at some wigs and hope to get out to try some soon, had a rougher time this time and have not felt up to much so looking forward to getting out next week maybe - tho if the snow rolls back that might be on hold eh??

I am due no.4 next week and when i see oncologist I am going to mention this.  Mine has got worse each time sadly but does usually just last for the first week. I have found that the majorty of the side effects go away or ease off after the first week. Tiredness is the ongoing one and found the nasty taste and spongy mouth lasted longer this time too tho has all but gone now. Well done for getting to work for now, I work for GP practice and they ordered me to stay away as a hotbed of winter nasties and could compromise my recovery = have popped in a few times when they are shut and manage to work from home on week 2 and 3 which helps to keep normal. Dont be surprised tho if the further along you go the less able to work as the tiredness can become overwhelming at times. Hope you find us useful - I couldnt manage now without these lovely ladies and i think it helps that we are all at different stages now too. love Bev xx",

I was only a 34AA/A and had the other one made bit bigger at same time to make them more even - that was 3 months ago but now all the swelling has gone down the recon is a bit smaller than the augmented one and def a diff shape. This is probably because they had to enlarge and reconstruct at the same time - I am guessing your partner did not have that ? How is it feeling for her now - I went to The Haven in London yesterday and another lady there had recon too and we both felt that they feel like a lump on the front of our chests. She has just finished her chemo and i am halfway through - number 4 next week! Apparently the chemo does have an effect on the implant so I will just have to be patient and wait for the effects of the chemo to finally wear off and see how it feels then. BT W - my hubby thinks it looks great - I am not so sure but reassuring he feels that way. Bev",

I am trying soaking cottonwool pads in eye lotion (am using Liz Earles Eyebright but guess Optrex would do) and resting them on my eyes as its nice and cold and may work in the same way as cold cap!! Anything worth a tr I suppose.   Went to The Haven yesterday and had a very interesting day. Although I would say the nutritionist was a disappointment. Her entire hour long speech was biasically the same old spiel we are always told - cut back on sugar and dairy/eat your 5 a day/ go organic if you can!! Nothing was specific to our condition. I asked her if there were any foods we should avoid while having chemo - anti-oxidants/probiotics etc - and she didnt think so - said the probiotic drinks was probably because they are dairy and nothing about anti-oxidants. So I am none the wiser really and just feel I will let my body do the talking - will eat a sensible diet but if I fancy something I will have it. I really feel now is not the time to worry overly much - and thankfully I was not alone thinking this as the majority of the women there felt the same. Two of them had finished chemo - one at the end  of December and her eyelashes and brows had grown back and head hair surprisingly long. The other finished at end of Jan and head hair growoing nicely but eye hair not back. So looks like up to 3 months before you get good result. Tho ofcourse that is probably an individual thing too. Anyway on countdown to number 4 on Tuesday = bloods willing!  Welcome to our new friends Love to all Bev x",

      "Content": "Hi Andrea Woke this morning and wondered how you got on and was going to message you - glad it wasnt too bad. I am not a milk drinker at all so cant help you there and diarrhoea def not a problem for me - i am total opposite tho better this time with the help of lots of plums!! Funnily enough I feel worse with the wig than i do with hats and scarves - isnt it starnge how we all react differently!! And you dont HAVE cancer - you are recovering from it now:) Katie - I hope your number 4 went ok too - I found this one rougher than number three but to be expected i suppose. My nails are looking very strange now - but the doc and nurse said they shouldnt come off. I now have dark shadow spreading down like a red cuticle at the wrong end!! plus white patches. Am not putting nail polish on tho and just keeping them well moisturised. The markings are def worse on right hand which is the hand i ose mostly for typing etc and i think it has something to do with nerve endings dying off - i find the numb feeling very annoying - thankfully i have been told that does eventually subside when chemo over! Anywa - hope you are ok and veins behaved this time:0 Have a good weekend ladies - clocks go forward, so do we!! Lots of love Bev x",

      "Content": "Hi Teggielass Hope you dont mind me joining this but could you tell me if your lymph nodes were affected and thats why you are having radio? I too had mastectomy but told i dont need radio - am assuming its cos my nodes were not affected but would be good to hear your story. I had immediate recon and there were times after the op that i wanted to rip it out and now the chemo fights it and makes it uncomfortable for about two weeks following each cycle so I am looking forward to seeing how it really is in the summer when all treatments are over! Also when you say you dont eat for 10 days - which 10?? I find the hardest bit is having to eat so often in the first five days following chemo because of the meds they give you - steroids after food and anti sick before - seems like i am constantly having to eat something - and really dont want to ! That said I do find that some food does help alleviate the nausea a bit. Then my appetite is really sharp and want to eat big meals - which i am not sure is helpful but cant seem to stop. Anyway - thanks for any feedback Bev x",

      "Content": "Hi Kat Thanks for your feedback - that is exactly what i said to hubby this morning!! Just cos i am over the half way point i still have three more lots of yuk times - but on the plus side I have done three and coped ok with those so chin up Bev and get on with the next three! I was also thinking about the hair thing too this morning - I shaved my completely smooth last cycle and there is definite regrowth now so even  if I continue to lose that each time then hopefully like you after a few weeks post last cycle i may have a fuzz too! One of the nurses where i work had radio and like you she is never still. Think she managed that bit and was tired after but she had virtually no time off work - she did not have chemo prior to this tho so I imagine radio after chemo will make the tiredness worse. I do hope its not too bad for you - I am lucky I dont need that as had mastectomy and no lymph nodes affected. Tiger stripes sounds very funky on the nail front. I have little white patches appearing and one thumb  is very ridged - will keep up the Superbalm and keep fingers crossed. Thanks again Kat Bev x",

      "Content": "Hi   I too opted to have chemo as I was told if it comes back it will then be secondary which is only treatable not curable. That made the decison for me! I agree chemo not so bad as you think - my last dose is due next week - hair has started to reappear. If you go for it check out the forum - had first FEC what else to come - lots of amazing tips and feedback on there - it really gave me the push to carry on with it - you will have down days but to be expected - but this forum gave me lots to laugh about too!! Good luck  ",
