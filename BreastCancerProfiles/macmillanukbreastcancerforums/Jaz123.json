    "Content": "Hi Shimmer Star, I am really sorry to hear that you are feeling the way you do, and to go through this at such a young age . I do feel for you. Just think its not long until August and you are nearly there. Then you will be shimmering again. :) I wonder if you could possibly assist me please? I note you had mastectomy and immediate reconstruction. I am due to have mastectomy with immediate LD reconstruction (the back one) operation next week. Did you have the LD reconstruction?  I also will need radiotherapy and understand it can affect it, but hospital are unable to advise too what extent, apparently for some people its a little others it can be more. Has your breast been affected a lot? Is it the shape/size or is it more how you feel about it?  I am really sorry to ask these question and when you are going through a difficult time, but my surgery is next week and am thinking whether I should have delayed- but I don't know how I will feel with only one breast.",
