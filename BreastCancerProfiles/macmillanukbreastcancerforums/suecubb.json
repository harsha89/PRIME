I have been reading the posts and been feeling more and more frightened and hopeless.....Im waiting for my results next monday and am so hoping its not spread and can be treated now with radiotherapy. I think I need to hear stories from people who are now ok. Oh Im under no illusions that mine may not be but I need my hope back, at least for a little while. sue x",

      "Content": "Hi It is very frightening but once you have your results it will be easier as you will know what you are dealing with. I was diagnosed on 9 feb and also had biopys on both breasts. I knew the lump was cancer even though non-one said but was totaly shocked by the 'grains' they found in the other breast. However, the grains turned out to be calcifications and not cancerous but the lump was cancer. The doctor told me there and then that he would operate to remove the lump and perform a SNB to see if cancer had spread to lymph nodes. Dont be afraid to ask for clarification if you dont understand anything. go with a list of questions if it will help. You may want to know time scales for surgery if thats whats needed and likely other treatments, where that would take place ect. Of course the waiting is aweful. I was told I would get my results on the same day as when I first attended and in the end had to go 3 times for 3 different tests and then had to push to bring my results forward as I couldnt bear any more not knowing. it sounds good that you are only having to wait a couple of days....I was nearlt 4 weeks and it was agony. At least you will know and know you will start your treatment as soon as possible. Good luck. i will be thinking of you.",

It sounds like your hospital is on the ball like they should be and mine wasnt/isnt. however, when all this is settled I will be campagning for a better service.. You are so right, not knowing is like a torture with your mind all over the place. It does settle once you know as you can begin to come to terms with whatever it is. I have had the lump removed and it was better than what I imagined. I think i thought I would have a dreadfuly mishapen breast . I am small breasted so it is noticable. I am 3 weeks on and now the swelling is settling it is looking more concave. some people on here have said it can be filled with your own body fat and I will be looking into that. i dont know if anyone on here has had it done. As for pain, everyones pain threshold is different but it was reasonably ok. I just feel tender now not pain and the scars feel a bit tight but I can move about ok. I actually found the biopsys more traumatic. At least with surgery you are asleep. Do keep in touch and please feel re-assured that the dreadful feeling you have now will lessen. with hugs....we will get through this.... Sue x",

      "Content": "Hi there I had a WLE and sentinel node biopsy at the end of February. I am about to start radiotherapy tomorrow and started on Anastrozole last week. Its probably too early to say if there are any side effects for me but so far so good. The thing is not everyone does have side effects, it depends on the individual. I agree, why not give it a try because if you do suffer effects that are too bad you can always stop it. It may be the drug that gives you that extra ten years or even more. Anything is worth a try; life is precious. Try not to worry about it. sometimes when we sit waiting for aches, pains ect then they happen. It doesnt mean they are not real or that we bring them on. Its just that we are focusing our awareness on that instead of just being. Try this. Just focus your attention on your big toe for a few mins. What does it feel like? Is it warm or is it cold? Is is comfy or not? See, I bet a few minutes ago you did not even notice your big toe? So sometimes it can be like that with other things. Just see how you go.....you may be fine then it is worth taking it. Huggs Sue",

I will keep you posted on any side effects from Anastrozole.. I dont know how long it would be for any to materialise but perhaps thats a good thing not knowing because then Im not waiting for any. I think the meds and radio must be a doddle compared to the treatment you have had and so many ladies here on this site. You will be starting yours then the week after next. It feels like we are ticking boxes off but if it helps us get our life back on track, its all good stuff. Best of wishes to you sue x",

Its waiting again and the frustration that all the delays i have had means now that treatment will coincide with holiday plans. im finding everyone is hugging me and saying how pleased they are for me almost like as if there is nothing to worry about now.

Im of the mind that if youre thinking about something/worried, then its important. You are important. You are the person who is ill so any concerns you have its important to voice them. Its your body and its like its let you down once so its so hard to trust it. The doctors have a job to do  but rightly or wrongly it tends to be thoses who shout loudest get seen, treated. It may be nothing Jan but you have a right to be checked out. I was at the hospital yesterday and was told by the doctor that he thinks Im post menapausal. I said 'you think but you dont know' He said the only way to know was a blood test so I said lets do it. so due to that I was given Tamoxifen rather than Arimadex or whatever it is. Im sending you a hug. Sue x",

I have told my breast nurse how bad I feel and she said I can ask my surgeon for a referal to a plastic surgeon when I next see him....in October. Im sorry but I cant wait that long to at least discuss my options. I have decided to ask the oncologist for a referal in 6 weeks time....failing that, my GP. Basically the bottom half of my breast has gone with the scar tissue stuck to my chest wall. i do believe larger ladies fair better. I know my partner feels pretty helpless and frustrated that he cant 'fix it'. I feel that I am almost looking for reasons to feel angry with him. I think its because I want him to say what I need to hear to feel comforted. I will go shopping again and I know I may feel different tomorrow. Im just so fed up feeling like this. Im a member of a 'club' that I never wanted to belong to. Oh and I have cats too only a few days ago one has left home. I found him and brought him home , kept him in for a couple of days but now hes gone again. Love Sue",

      "Content": "Hi there. I havent posted on here for quite some time but have read everyone elses and have found them helpful and supportive. I finished my radiotherapy 2 weeks ago and am now waiting for a follow up appointment with my oncologist. So why do I feel so low? I 'should' be feeling relieved. After all I have only had 2 lymph nodes removed which were both clear. I had a WLE so have kept some of my breast. However, everytime I look in the mirror I just see this deformed breast which looks aweful. I keep feeling I should be grateful I didnt need a mastectomy and I really appologise to those who have and are thinking yes , I should be grateful. but I dont feel glad I had cancer. I dont feel glad I now have a horribly mishapen breast. I dont feel grateful that I have a blue blob in the centre of what little cleavage I have left that reminds me everytime I look down that this is my mark for rads. I had a meltdown yesterday and my partner who is usually very sensitive to my feelings said I was silly getting all worked up. That really hurt. When I challenged him he said he has had to harden himself because we think he has prostate cancer and are awaiting more tests. I know there is nothing I can do to change any of it and he is right that we just have to get on with it but I feel that I am sinking into a place of hoplessness. My neice is getting married in 2 weeks and I havent got the outfit yet. I cant find anything I like because I feel such a mess. I cant wear a bra at the moment because Im still sore. When i tried last week some of the skin rubbed. My breasts are small anyway so without a bra I look like I have no breasts at all. And I know Im moaning but I dont know who else I can now moan to. It feels ages since I last felt happy. I keep trying to arrange things, nights out and going away for a few days but it all feels too much then I cant be bothered then I feel I 'should' be getting on with things. Has anyone else felt like this at the end of treatment in particular when they have had less invasive treatment? Sue",

I know this is the best possible outcome to have and am relieved but was really shocked when the dressings came off. I feel so shallow even mentioning this but Im feeling very worried about the appearance of what I have left/ The scar is tight and very puckered and my breast is hard and lumpy. Has anyone else had this experience? will my breast ever look anything like the other one again? I have only been living with my partner of 7 years, for 2 months. We thought the was going to be a new start for us but has turned into a nightmare. I cant bear to undress in front of him because im afraid he will be repulsed. Am I just being silly. I am so sorry because I know so many ladies have to endure much worse and are so brave. I think the whole thing has just been such as shock. SC x",
