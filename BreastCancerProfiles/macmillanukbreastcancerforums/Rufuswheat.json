      "Content": "It's absolutely normal to feel scared. I am 48 and had a mastectomy with immediate implant reconstruction 9 weeks ago and I was very tearful beforehand. However, the op was straightforward and the whole medical team were wonderful. You'll be well looked after and will have a graduated exercise programme to go home with. With reconstruction, you'll need to take it easy for 8-12 weeks. I can honestly say that the whole process is not as bad as I feared. Yes,it's taking time to get used to my new, nippleless boob - some days I think 'she' looks great, other days not - but clothed (even in a bikini!), no-one can tell the difference.  Talk to your breast care nurse - She can put you in  touch with others who've been in the same boat and that will hopefully reassure you. Take care x",

      "Content": "Hi, Thanks, yes I do drive, both to work and taking my 12 year old twins to their activities etc.  I have been so lucky - my partner is working more from home at the moment and my dad is staying here and is essentially my personal taxi driver.  Had I not had that support, life would have been a bit trickier, or I would have had to ask friends for more help.   My surgeon's instructions were no driving for 8-12 weeks.  As I have help, I'm leaving it to nearer the 12 week point but I actually feel very fit and well.  If you have a mastectomy with no immediate reconstruction, I believe the recovery time is quicker but I'm not sure how many weeks.  All the best with your surgery - it really wasn't as bad as I'd feared. x",

      "Content": "Sorry that you've got to have more treatment.  I've not had to have chemo as my cancer cells were non-invasive, so I can't put myself in your shoes but, with young children, you will want to take whatever steps you have to to ensure that your future risk is gone. I found this poster the other day.  I liked its message so I've framed it. All the best with your treatment, stay strong x",
