At least I feel better mentally and physically and ready to tackle chemo 2 on Wednesday . Here's hoping for minimal side effects for all passengers on the train xx",

      "Content": "Hi Mrs50 Thanks for your reply. At least I am lucky to have both arms available for use so I really do feel for you. Perhaps you could try asking for a PICC line rather than a Hickman, they might be more receptive to that as lots of people seem to have been able to have one of those for their chemo. I will speak to my oncologist on Monday when he phones me with my blood test results.  I hope you have success in getting some help from your chemo team.  I don't like to complain too much as I have not been suffering too badly with other side effects which I hope will continue. Wishing you well for your next round and good luck talking to your oncologist. ",

      "Content": "Thanks for the advice TheScriptFan. What you describe is exactly how my arm feels. I will speak to oncologist about the cream you were given to see if that will help me too. Although I am still worried about the long term damage to my veins I take great comfort in knowing that the pain has eased off for you.  Thank you so much for taking the time to help.",

      "Content": "Hi kiwi_h thanks for the reply. I will speak to my oncologist to see what he thinks about it. My inclination is that he will not think it is worth putting in a PICC line when I only have another 4 to go but if I don't try I won't know.",

      "Content": "Hi Everyone, I am getting very worried about the effect the chemo is already having on my veins. Had 2 FEC, due next on 28th December, both into my right arm and it is now an effort to stretch the arm out straight. My main concern is that I am due to have 6 FEC and don't know how my veins are going to cope with that much. My original thought had been that if I could manage 3 in one arm, I could swap to the other side for the next 3. Now I don't know what to think. I have not had surgery yet so do have both arms available. I did think about asking for a PICC line but I don't know if they would agree to it and, to be honest, I am a bit scared of the problems you can get from that too. Why is everything involved in dealing with this cancer so painful and stressful!   When I was diagnosed I was very calm and just wanted to know what I was dealing with so we could get on and get it sorted. I accepted everything I was told and all the scans and tests that had to be done quite happily but now I think every test and procedure and needle has chipped away at my resilience so I don't have much left in reserve . Sorry, this has turned into a moan when I wanted to ask for advice.  I hope everyone else is coping okay with their chemo treatments  x",
