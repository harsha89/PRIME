Its not being a wimp to take time to look after yourself and put your own needs first. Give yourself the time you need as everyone says this is a journey that takes all your energy both physically and emotionally.  Hugs Mary xxxx",

I have been fine but I had a gp appt today just to catch up and check wound and its like it really hit me that I have bc . That probably sounds stupid as I have had my surgery so its not like I havent started on this journey. I just feel so low I am not a person who has ever had time off work or been at the doctors from one year to the next so it just seems like this bloody disease is controlling me. I am sure this will pass soon I am usually a glass half full sort of person. Mary xx",

      "Content": "Hi  I am half way through 15 rads, I asked GP for R1/R2 but was told they had not heard of it and after more research turns out its not on the list that they can prescribe in this area. I asked the team at hospital and they just said that they can not recommend anything as they can not be seen to be favouring any product but that I would be OK with any emollient( but not aqueous cream as this has been reformulated and not classed as emollient)  I did manage to obtain some R1/R2 as one of the lovely ladies on here has sent me some she had left over and so far the results are good. I think many of the professionals are always wary of recommending any thing new until its completely proven and they are happy to stick to what ever has worked for others in the past. I am sure that with the pester power of the ladies on here it will soon be a product we can obtain with out having to beg. Hope everyone is coping OK with rads. Hugs Mary x",
