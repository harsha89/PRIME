      "Content": "Hey Goodbun I also receive Piriton prior 2 my Paclitaxel in case of any allergic reactions but they've never said wot they could b. The Piriton knocks me out & I'm asleep on & off 4 most of the session. It wears off by the time I'm due 2 go home which is fine as I drive myself 2 the hospital. I do have a lovely pinkish face the nxt day but blame that on the steroids. However over the course of the day it improves & no further meds r required. I'm just so glad I don't take any friends or family with me when I have this course of treatment as I'd feel guilty about snoozing the whole time & being unsocialable haha. 7 more weekly sessions to go with this regime then we'll c wot the nxt plan is (I've had 11 already). Hope urs is going ok Ciao  WB xx",
