      "Content": "Hi Babs Just sending you good wishes and to let you know i feel the same. I am on day 5 after mastectomy and find mornings the worse time, usually down, irritable and tearful and then feel brighter during the day. I have kept myself busy seeing friends and family but if i am alone and tired i can feel really tearful and scared. I get the impression it is really normal to feel this way especially after what we have just been through trying to heal physically and cope emotionally. I had my drain removed today and it is so good to be able to shower and not worry about remembering to carry my bag or stop it getting twisted. I stood on the tube Saturday dislodged it, lost the vacuum and started to wail. A quick trip back to the hospital and all was sorted. Its mad that something so simple can suddenly feel so major. My thoughts are with you Monkey xxx",

      "Content": "Hi Coot I had a mastectomy on the 1st August and it wasn't half as bad as i thought it would be. I went home the next day with a drain in. It was a bit awkward but not that bad. I had the drain in for 5 days, i put it in a little bag & carried it round with me. I looked at the scar almost straight after i woke up as i wanted to see what it looked like. I had been picturing it in my mind a week beforehand so it wasn't really much of a shock, although I know it is really different for different people.  After about two weeks i found the best bra was my sports bra as this keeps the comfie in place. I got two comfies and have sewn one into my swimming costume so i could go for a dip once my scar had healed.  I didn't have too much pain. I was discharge from hospital with codeine, paracetamol & diclofenac. I took paracetamol 4x per day and had codeine the first few nights which i think really helped me sleep as sleeping was a bit awkward for the first few nights. I had 8 nodes removed altogether. I do think that everything does seem so much harder if you are tired or feeling low. Definitely think the waiting is the hardest part to cope with. I have my onc appointment next week and hope to start FEC soon after Good luck on your journey xxx",

      "Content": "Good morning ladies Just wanted to say thank you for the helpful comments and advice prior to op last wednesday. Taking my phone into hospital was such a good idea. The op wasn't so bad and although the emotional side of things is a bit full on at times, the fear and anticipation is way worse. Definitely a waiting game this cancer business. Us women have amazing capacity to cope, share and be patient though i think. Reading the activity and discussions feels like such a life line, to know i am not alone and experience so many of the thoughts and feelings that are openly shared. Thank you    ",
