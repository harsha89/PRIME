    "Content": "Hi everyone I am 31 and have stage 2. Type 3 ER Negative and HER2 positive in my right breast and lymph nodes... I have respond well to my 3 lots of docetaxal and now and looking at last chemo next week then surgery... I have been recommended breast conservation and lymph node removal but really want a double mastectomy for peace of mind.... I have met my breast care nurse today and she has told me it may be difficult to convince my surgeon mr raj Achuthan to do the double.... He obviously has never had breast cancer and is not in my situation..\u2026 I was diagnosed a week before my wedding and have been fortunate to have Ivf and have got some embryos frozen for when I have beaten cancer... But I cannot bear the thought of going through all this again.... I wintered if anyone else had had difficulty \"convincing\" their surgeon to do the operation they want and if anyone has any experience of surgery in Leeds with mr raj Achuthan?? Thanks Claire x",
