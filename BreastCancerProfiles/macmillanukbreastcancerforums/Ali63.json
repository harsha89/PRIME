      "Content": "Hi have growth around ears and very sparse on top and back. Didn't mind being bald when I was going through treatment. Shaved it off because it came out. Wore scarves and hats and au natural. It doesn't feel right to carry on wearing head gear as people still think I'm ill! So now I don't wear anything (on my head) have a wig but it's so itchy. Will see if I get any growth with minoxidil if not back to the wig shop. Ali",
