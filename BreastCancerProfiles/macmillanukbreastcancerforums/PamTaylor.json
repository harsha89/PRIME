      "Content": "~Thanks for your reply :) It's good to know that I am not the only one. I was given the book \"Mummys Lump\" when I was given the mindfield of information from the MacMillian Nurse when I was first diagnosed. I had my first Chemo session yesterday and my daughter now sees how poorly I am and has changed - think it is more to do with Daddy putting her to bed and not putting up with the same nonsence where as I start on a guilt trip on myself.  Hope everything is ok with you xx",

      "Content": "Hello Ladies, I have only recently joined you. I was diagnosed with an Invasive Ductal Carsonoma back in June, I had the lump removed 12th July  which was a success. The problem I am experiencing is with my 6yr old daughter and was hoping to pick ypur brains :) We hve explained what is happening to mummy as simply and straightforward as we can and read the book given to us by MacMillan but she has developed a seperation anxiety at bed time. It is taking us 2-3 hrs to get her to go to sleep. She doesn't want me to leave the room. We have tried just about everything bu nothing is working and I am strting to worry as I start my Chemo next week. Just wondering if any of you Ladies have experienced the same or have any suggestions before I turn into a raving lunitic :) Yhanks for reading xx  ",
