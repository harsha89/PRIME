      "Content": "Hi, I have read as much as I can find on fasting, especially Dr Volta Longo, it made me feel empowered to think there is something that just might help me through chemo. Anyway, I have just completed 6 rounds of FEC-T (today was my last one woohoo) and have \u201cfasted\u201d for 3 days prior and 24hrs after each treatment. I did a keto fast with a bit of vege juice to keep my strength and nutrient intake up. A full-on water fast would have too much for me! I didn\u2019t loose any weight as i probably over compensated on the days afterward. Overall I\u2019m very happy I did the fast, mainly because it made me feel positive and in fighter mode. I haven\u2019t had many side effects throughout, a touch of nausea and tiredness for the first 4-5 days. Of course, I have no way of knowing what my symptoms would have been had i not fasted.  I have met quite a few women (who didn\u2019t fast or do anything \u201calternative\u201d) who have found chemo doable, with mild side effects, and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s the positive attitude and trying to keep chipper and do nice fun things despite all the crappy stuff, that helps.",

      "Content": "Hi Kaz K I have just had round 5 of FEC-T. I lost all my hair on FEC apart from eyebrows and eyelashes.  After the last round of FEC I noticed some definite regrowth of head hair, just a bit of stubble so I'm still wearing my wig! My wig is starting to look more like a wig because some bits of hair have come off near the front, showing the netting underneath, gah! I have lost a few lashes on T and my eyebrows are thinner, but bizarrely I am growing new baby eyelashes at the same time as a couple of strands coming out. Hi Jammy R Good luck for round 5 tomorrow, it's a great feeling to be nearly done with this step. And hooray for hair starting to regrow! ",

      "Content": "Hi Springrose I am 7 weeks post finishing my last round of \"T\" chemo and my hair has started to grow back at the sides, but the top is very thin and patchy. It started to regrow after the last round of FEC and I would say it would be about 0.5 inch in the areas that it has grown. It has that slate grey look that someone else mentioned. I really hope that changes! As for my eyelashes and brows, I lost I'd say 70% of those during the T phase and they are very slow to come back. I have some eyelashes still falling out where others are regrowing!  Good luck! ",

      "Content": "Hi everyone I am new to this forum and wanted to say hi. I was diagnosed back in January and am having neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. I have a 3cm lump (with satellite nodules whatever they are), ER and PR positive, HER2 negative, grade 2. I have had 3 rounds of FEC and 1 round of T so far, and all in all the side effects have been manageable. I had an MRI scan last week to check to see if the lump is shrinking and nervously waiting the results!  Has anyone in a similar situation to me had to wait long for MRI results, and could you feel that your lump had definitely shrunk? My oncologist examined me and said \"hmmmm yes that feels smaller than 3cm\", not very scientific but still, there's hope!",

For me the first was worse mainly because it's scary to start something new, and very emotional because the situation really hits home.  But the goods news is the time for me has gone so quickly, and I am about to have round 5 of FEC-T tomorrow. I'm strangely excited just to get there and just get it done. And I must say I enjoy having a good excuse to rest and have someone else do the kids kids tea and bedtime palarva! ",

In fact I found it easier than the FEC in a way because I didn't have any nausea with it. The worst part for me was an achy spasm in my back which came from the white blood cell injections. And I tended to get very down and despondent about 4-5 days after the treatment, like I'd totally lost all positivity. But luckily I bounced back with a bit of TLC.  Take care xx ",

      "Content": "Hi all Today is a good day, I have just finished chemo!!  I had 6 rounds of FEC-T and the side effects have all been mild. Although it\u2019s too soon to say what the side effects from this final round will be, I\u2019m having some chest pains and just watching and waiting at the moment to see if they magically go away! I am pre menopausal (age 35) and like others have been having hot flashes. I\u2019ve had my usual period throughout although it hasn\u2019t materialised this month, so that might be the end of that. Sad face. Still, I have two little beauties age 3 and 5 to take my mind off things and keep me busy. I have to say the worst part of all this is the worry and fear that gets you in the middle of the night. Physical side effects you can take a pill for. Anyway, I have done lots on my journey to keep my pecker up, meditation has been wonderful, and plenty of walking and treating to myself to fresh flowers just because. Wishing everyone healing vibes and peace (I\u2019ve turned into a hippy haha)",

I also do acupuncture and juice fasting, the acupuncture really helps with my stress levels but is so expensive! By the way, how much time do others get with their oncologist? I get a rushed few minutes, I've never had a good long chat with them really. But then again I see them every 3 weeks before each cycle. Cycle 5 for me this Wednesday, my second dose of the T. Side effects have been manageable so far so fingers crossed.  Good luck to all!",
