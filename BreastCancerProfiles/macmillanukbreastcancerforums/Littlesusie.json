I had my surgery in August and since then we've done lots of stuff. 3 weeks after surgery was my birthday don't we had a day in London. The week before I started my chemo and to celberate our wedding anniversary we had 4 days in Paris. we go to the theatre and cinem as often as possible. This isn't just about me, hubbie is living with too. Over the last 10 years we've had sick and ageing parents (long distance) that took up most of our weekends and we were both working full time. So when all this happened I was determined I wasn't going to go into a decline and as a result, I do feel OK most days but am very aware of my limitations. This little bugger affects us all very differently and I know I've been a lot luckier than some of my poor cyber friends. I'm now looking forward to the end of chemo (1 more to go) and all the things we've got planned for the summer. And we probably would'nt have planned some of them had it not been for my BC.",

I had a mastectomy because my lump was 4cm and my surgeon initially was going to go the lumpectomy route, but after my ct said she would get enough clear margins and was concerned about the appearance of my breast afterwards. Both she and my bcn were wonderful and mad sure I was aware of the implications. I have to say I have no regrets about that decision at all. My prognosis is very good and that's all that's important ",

We sometimes go to the pub for a meal after the film. I've seen something on at the local theatre that we both want to see, so I'm looking at the dates for that, I also go to a food tasting panEl that I've been doing for a year, but that is when I feel up to it and it fits in with everythin else.

Also if you then need to have RT the implant can go hard and will need to b removed. I was big busted too before my mx (40dd) and my surgeon said that there was no way she could match them. I had a prothesis to start with (think of it s a bridging loan). Now two years post treatment I've got my new boobs (38c) nd they're lovely. I've got a prothesis nipple on the reconstructed side. I see my surgeon in 3 weeks for a check up. The prothesis fitter at the hospital has offered to make an air filled on to round off the shape for me. If you'd like a picture of my nipple let me know . The best bit is tht I don't have to wear huge bra and can evn go without ",

My lump was found by a routine mammo. I had a follow up appt 2 weeks later which consisted of a 2nd mammo, an ultra sound and core biopsy all within 90 minutes. The following week a saw my lovely surgeon who gave me the initial results. At that time she was talking straightforward lumpectomy but needs me to have an MRI to be sure she had enough clear margin. Sadly for me it wasn't to be and when I saw her a week later she confirmed I would need a full mastectomy. At all of my appointments I had access to a breast nurse if I wanted it. And every time I've seen my lovely surgeon there has been a bc nurse there. I'm now 6weeks post op and have nothing but praise for the team looking after me. At every stage they have made sure that I've had all the info I might need. You will also loads of lovely people on this forum who've been through this and will offer advice not found in any book. I hope this helps, this is the one time of your life when you really need too make as big a fuss as you need to, it's yupour body. Do let us know how you get on. Lots of hugs,😍",

Three days after that we are going to Paris and it would have been so nice to have pretty underwear to take with me. The day before that I have my oncology appointment. Lovely nurse also told me that if I have a significant amount of fluid, he will delay the start of my treatment.

I then saw my surgeon most weeks from 20 April until the end of May when we decided that we'd got the size we wanted. Be warned the tissue expander looks nothing like the finished item. It can feel a it uncomfortable for a day or two but it is not painful. I had my permanent implant and the other breast reduced on Monday and neither looks like a breast at the moment but my surgeon said she was happy with it and I trust her completely.

Because I haven't yet had my CT scan (that's tomorrow) they can't be 100% sure that there is nothing sneaking waiting in the wings. Because I also have high blood pressure I have to have a heart scan next week and go back to I oncology the week after. DO NOT be shy about asking questions, after all it's your body. If necessary take some with you - 2 minds are better than one. I don't know what the percentage is of recurrence, apparently it's all about reducing the risk. Good luck, and big hugs Sue",

A lovely lady in Coventry rang head office for info. As a result she found out the the bras won't be available before next week; they may (or not) be available in store but don't know which ones. Nor could she find out the size range. Come on ladies, pester you local stores. It's about time we could buy our underwear in the same way our 2 breasted sisters can Sorry this is best I could do. M&S are launching the lingerie to go with this camp in the next week or so. Full range of 7 bras, knickers, slips and camisoles. However, only one of the bras will be suitable for those of us who wear of prothesis and that will only go up to a DD cup. So far, their Facebook page has had almost 7,000 posts very few of which have been complimentary. So come on girls lets really make M&S change their policy.",

My breast nurse drained almost 2 litres over 5 weeks after my surgery. It's not much fun but necessary. Some oncologists won't start chemotherapy until it's all gone. I've just had breast reduction surgery on my remaining breast and according to the breast nurse yesterday iv got a small seroma that doesn't need draining and will clear up by itself over the next few weeks. Hope this helps.",

Since then we've had days in london, the theatre, been to Paris and a Christmas trip to Calais! Now 6 post final treatment.
