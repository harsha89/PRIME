I finished rads about 8 weeks ago. i am struggling with the focusing too.  I think it\u2019s because all priorities have changed and a lot of things  that I thought were important no longer matter.  Our bodies and brains have had a lot to deal with and it\u2019s going to take time.  A lot of things don\u2019t mean a jot to me and I can get frustrated wondering why they are important to someone else - but I am teaching myself tolerance Good luck with the rads, and the Tamoxifen is fine too hugs Ange xx",

      "Content": "Hi Ladies Just copied this from the oncotype page.   The results take a couple of weeks to come back, but for those that are able to avoid chemo well worth the wait xx If you have recently been diagnosed with early-stage oestrogen receptor positive (ER+) invasive breast cancer, you will discuss your treatment options with your doctor*. Choosing the optimal treatment for your breast cancer is important and you need to weigh the risks and benefits of chemotherapy with your doctor in order to make a decision that is right for you. Applying Genomics to Cancer A genomic test, such as the Oncotype DX test for invasive breast cancer, looks at groups of genes and how active they are. This activity can influence how a cancer is likely to grow and respond to treatment. Unlike a breast cancer genetic test, the Oncotype DX breast cancer test does not provide information about a person\u2019s inherited genetic make-up; instead it looks at genes in a patient\u2019s breast tumour to understand how these genes interact and influence the tumour\u2019s behaviour. Because every woman\u2019s tumor is unique, understanding the biology of your specific tumor will help you and your doctor make more confident decisions about your care. Find out if you\u2019re eligible for the test.  About the Test To date, the Oncotype breast cancer test has been ordered in over 850,000 patients. The Oncotype DX test can thus help you and your doctor to make a more informed and personalised decision about whether to treat with chemotherapy or not, based on further information that is specific to the biology of your cancer. The Oncotype DX test has been available in the UK and Ireland since the end of 2007, with usage in both the NHS and private sectors growing",

I have been moisturising like crazy neck, armpit etc has anyone been advised to use a particular cream.  I read somewhere on here that Aveeno was good so that's what I have, not sure whether to ask my GP for the R1 and R2 creams as they seem to have good reviews. Still having the odd wobble too, although less so than at the start. But am still wondering whether my new normal is going to be made up of a lot more wobbles even as I move forward.

No chemo for me fortunately, my onc score was 19.  I had done a lot of research prior and had decided that for me anything below 25 and I would have opted out, each of us have to make a decision that we can live with.  Fortunately the decision was taken out of my hands as the Oncologist said no chemo. The Tamoxfen is honestly fine, day 32 (I am taking at 18:30) and I have not noticed too much difference, night sweats (but I was going to get them at some point anyway).  In fact I was keen to start taking them ASAP because I kept thinking that the conditions of my body were susceptible to growing BC and anything I could do to alter these levels would help prevent another incident. There has been an item on our breakfast Tv news this morning about high % of women opting out of Tamoxifen,  and how it is astonishing medics around the world, that something that assists in preventing an event (in those high risk) is being refused for fear of side effects. Rads are all fine drinking an extra two litres and moisturising often. I seem to have missed the tiredness so far, although I know it is coming. Big hugs and best wishes to all on this journey.

I have a daughter who is 14, and we are very close too.  I made a decision to not tell her until after the lumpectomy, and then I could tell her I HAD breast cancer rather than I have.  I told her the day I came hope after the op, and explained the rest of the treatment was preventative.  She coped really well with this and a week later told me she was ver happy that I told her this way. Sods Law but she is  taking triple science and learning about radiotherapy - just as I started mine, that led to some interesting discussions - \u2018why are they treating you for something that has gone\u2019 \u2018do you know radiotherapy does this\u2019 Just glad she is still talking about it and not keeping it to herself. I also phoned and spoke to her year head and explained the situation and the need for support. The school have been brilliant, if she feels tearful (and there have been a couple of days)  she sits in with the year head in whichever lesson he is taking.   Just as it is difficult for us to find someone who understands, it is the same for them.  Hugs Ange x",

The first appointment should give you your surgery results and the second your treatment plan. Good luck with both xx hugs Ange",

      "Content": "Hi Figkip Just a thought but what time are you taking them.  Not sure if it makes a difference but I have been taking mine at 18:30 just after tea and fortunately haven't noticed any nausea.  I am hoping to sleep through any side effects. I chose the time in case I forgot to take them, and ended up having a panic all day at work. I am on day 12. I remember ginger was good for nausea, so maybe get some ginger tablets from the chemist, but you may need to check this out with BC nurse. Hugs Ange xx",

When I found my lump more than half of my friends and colleagues said that they had had a scare, which led to nothing.  Fortunately I made the appointment to get it checked as mine wasn't as innocent as theirs. Mine was 12mm and did move about a bit, so close to the chest wall that I couldn't feel it lying down or standing up, only when leaning forward.   Two weeks post op now and waiting for full results. Fingers crossed for you, Love and hugs xx Ange",

      "Content": "Hi Julie I had the same symptoms, feeling in a dark place and tearful all the time.  A few weeks after starting tamoxifen it was like a black cloud over my head, After about a month I decided to split my tablets half morning and half tea time (this used to be how they were dispensed, cheaper for the one tablet) and the difference was incredible.  No dark thoughts, 99% less tears and improved energy levels. I am still a little more tired and a bit more achy, but hoping this will improve as my body adjusts, def manageable. I honestly believe I can live my life to the full on these.  I am on week 14 and 4 weeks out from rads. Rads were not too bad at all so try not to worry about them too much. My only advice would be moisturise plenty and often and drink lots of water. It is probably worth running it past your team before you start to split, hopefully they will not mind as there are a lot of ladies managing better this way, with the backing of their onc. Hopefully the same for you  Big hugs xxx Ange",

      "Content": "You are very welcome Julie x There is so much going on at this point that you don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s the whole thing, the tamoxifen, the rads.  I can only speak from my own experience but 4 weeks out from rads and for the first time in 6 months I am starting to feel like me, which I never even thought was possible.  It really is a slow process but you will get there, there\u2019s no rushing through x tears are a big part of this. A big huge thank you to you Leolady, in the early days it was you that managed to pull me through all the ****.  I am glad to see that you are nearly at the end of your treatments, and fab to see you have kept the positivity.  I remember oncotype-gate xxx Thanks for the sun advice too, my rads team advised to put cream on even under my clothes as some materials let the rays in.  I have found a fab cream on Amazon called Altruists.  It comes in a 50 and 30 has no odour and designed by dermatologists.  It\u2019s cheap too £7 for 2 x 200ml.  Sorry would post link but on my phone, if do a search in Amazon it will come up with loads of other positive info.  The monthly rads page is an absolute godsend, it is lovely and supportive and makes you feel that you are not alone.  I even read through a couple of the previous months for any tips and what to expect - I\u2019m a bit of a planner Hugs xx Ange",

The whole family have been using it too - cheeky buggers! Saw my GP today and asked if he\u2019d order the 10mg tablets, he said they were special order and really expensive compared to the 20mg which are mass produced - he said just carry on splitting.   Hugs Ange xx",

We are all going to be taking these tablets for a very long time so anything that makes things easier is always worth a try. I am nearly four months in and things are much better, I think our bodies need to make adjustments. A positive outlook always helps too, which in the circumstances is sometimes the most difficult bit. I am friends with Jill and another lovely lady Jan who I met on this site, and we absolutely can have a moan and pull each other back up which I think has helped tremendously. Hugs Ange xxx",

Hopefully what you are feeling is just everything settling now, under the scar I did have some hardness but I think,this was just scar tissue and has almost gone now (5th Feb for my op).  Same with the swelling. Always best to check with BC nurse or consultant to put your mind at rest. Best wishes and hugs for tomorrow.  Ange xx",
