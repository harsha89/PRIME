      "Content": "Hi all Just had second FEC last weds -  not too bad this time round. Given emend which helped with sickness. Still felt quite sick on first night and queasy on thurs/ fri but not actually sick.  What I am struggling with is a drink! I have always enjoyed water but it's not going done well?  Have tried bottled and tap - both just horrible.  Can't manage sparkling drinks including water and these burn and give  a sort of indigestion feeling!  I've never been a juice drinker or tea drinker and have gone right off my usual coffee!!! Any ideas anyone?  I know I am not drinking enough! ",

This is due to Persephone trial showing 6 months as effective as 12 months.  I am very bone achy and on heart tablets due to heart not performing as it should??   What are people's thoughts on how long? ",
