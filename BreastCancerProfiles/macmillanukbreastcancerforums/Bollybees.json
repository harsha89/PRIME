      "Content": "Hi, sorry you feeling poorly, have you spoken to tour gp or chemo nurse about the side effects? I take omeprazole and had diarrhoea tablets on stand by. I find taking medication early helps, don't wait for it to get a hold. Have you got any treatment for oral thrush? That is pretty much a given that you will get that and corsydyl mouth wash twice daily helps. I ate lots of fresh pineapple and watermelon which seems to help with the mouth and ice pips to keep the water intake up.  I started to feel better after 7 days and pretty much normal, although still tired after 10days so hopefully you will start to improve. Never feel bad asking for help, I find most people want to help they are just scared to ask and don't know what to do or say. There is always a shoulder to cry on here, we have all had the same feelings and know what you are going through.  I found it hard in the middle thinking it was never going to end but before you know it you will be at the end.  Im thinking of you and have my fingers crossed the side effect start improving, dont suffer in silence, ask for medication to help.

      "Content": "Hi, I was really worried about this combination but genuinely found it much easier to deal with than the EC (that made me feel really awful) I am on my 4th and final one tomorrow. I do get bad aches and pains but it is controllable with paracetamol every 4 hours and it gradually gets worse over the week then goes away. I'm tired but still get out with the dog for a slow easy walk every day. Just be prepared to take things very easy for 10 days or so and rest when you need to. The worst thing for me was the horrible taste and  dry mouth along with a bleeding sore nose and blocked sinuses. These got worse with each dose. Again it's not nice but it is doable, just take things day by day. As for going to the wedding maybe go along with a view that you can leave as soon as you start feeling tired(if it's local) don't wait until you are really flagging, you will regret it the next day.   As much as possible I have tried to carry on with my life and enjoyed the things I can, it's the only way I could get through it. Everyone is different so just do what you can.  Big hugs and I really hope it goes well. X",

      "Content": "That's great news I'm so glad you made it to the wedding. The yucky mouth is awful. Have you checked if you have thrush, if so get treatment ASAP, I had to take Nystan every cycle, Fresh pineapple helps and sucking on ice pops. I found it lasted about 10 days and my taste came back for a week or so before before doing it again. Anything sugary made it a lot worse and spicy gave me diarrhoea so boring tasteless food was all I could have. I also got omeprazole to help with the acid indigestion, talk to your GP.   It will all be over soon and you will be back on the yummy stuff again. Stay strong. X",
