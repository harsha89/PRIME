    "Content": "Hello I hope all goes well for you today with your appointment.  I  finished 6 (FEC) chemo treatments in January of this year and I am now having herceptin as my cancer was HER 2 pos. I was bothered by the two things you mentioned and that was losing my hair and sickness.  My first treatment went fine but I did feel nauseous the next morning and I found myself laying around on the sofa as I wasn't interested in doing anything.  This lasted for 3 days and then I was fine.  I was not sick.  On my next appt with the oncologist and before my second treatment I told her that I had felt this way and she gave me an extra tablet which I was to only take half of each morning and evening for 3 days after the treatment.  This worked as I never felt as bad again. I tried the cold cap to keep my hair which is (or was)  very thick and shoulder length.  I managed two goes with the cap but I hated it and decided on the third treatment not to have it. A wig lady was always present at the hospital on treatment days and I purchased one from her on my first session with chemo.  I now have two the same as the first is starting to get tatty.  My hair came out finally just before my fourth treatment but it is now growing back.  I have to say the wigs are fab and I am always being complimented on mine.  I was lucky as it only took a few goes before I found one I felt comfortable in.  Make sure you are really happy with yours if you decide to buy one.  Mine was £60 which was a little bit of a shock but I don't think I had much choice!! Honestly none of it is as bad as you think it will be... and it goes fast!! Good Luck!",
