      "Content": "Thanks Dawn, I had EC Chemo, not a fun ride is it, but we do recover, I wish you a speedy recovery, Yeah I was of the same mind when they suggested Chemo, was not happy about it, but it's par for the course in beating this horrid thing that invades us. Rads are a doddle compared to chemo, although my skin did break down and became very very sore, once it's done with it healed very quickly, and the joint pain of Tamoxifen has almost gone as well, think my body has got used to them lol. Macmillan helped me cope a lot with my treatment and with the cost of things, so it's my way of saying thank you, plus it will help someone else who was like me. Thanks again Dawn Gill xx",

      "Content": "hello everyone, been a while since I was on here, I have had all my treatments for brest cancer, and came out the other end, i've just had my first year all clear, YEAH, there is a light at the end of the tunnel, please dont give up fighting. I came on here to ask your views, on a fundraising subject, I know a lot of you are just staring on the rough road to recovery, and my thoughts are with. My idea is, when i was diagnosed with cancer, and had the lumectomy, it was siad i was going to be having radio therapy and tamoxifen, but the cancer was grade 2, almost a 3 so they suggested I had chemo as well, at my first appointment i was told not to use chemicals from soaps and shower gel's or shampoo's, any way after all my treatment i wanted to try doing something different, and for the good to my skin, and my childrens, after reading and reserching all the bad things they tell us are beneficial to our daily washing needs, I learned that we are better off doing what our ancesters did, and making our own, sorry thing I should say soaps and shampoos now, I get a little carried away. So I experimented and started making soap the best way, with no chemicals. Finally after 2 months of turning my kitchen into a lab, I am now quite good at it, so my idea was to make and sell soaps on behalf of Macmillan, to raise funds, I was wondering what everyone thinks about it. Thanks in advance for you replys. Gill xx",

      "Content": "Hi everyone, I hope your all feeling good today, I was diagnosed in September last year, I have had the requested 2 surgerys (as they didnt get the clear margins) I was 43 then, and have 2 son's who are nearly 13 and 11 now, it was hard on them at first, but they came to exept it, and got on with life, we still have a few bumps, but overall they handled it pretty well, must admit I do tend to spoil them a little bit more on my good days. I am just recovering after my last onslaught of chemo, 25/4/12, this one had me in casualty with bleeding and extremely painful stomach, no help from my local GP, or casualty staff, I am going to complain about the after care of a person who is having treatment, seem's to me they pump you full of poison and send you home to suffer. (sorry Rant over) thank god it's not as bad today as it has been. After joining this site in Sept, I've read everyone's emails, but never had the nerve to reply to any of them, everyone elses advice seems to cover what I would have said, I would like to say your all bright shining stars, the support you show to others is amazing. I have learned a lot about my own cancer, and how to deal with the issues we are faced with, it's a rough and rocky road, but the strenght we have pulls us through. Now I am facing Radiotherapy, I go for marking up tomorrow, I am feeling a bit scared about this, probably as it's something new lol. Could anyone advise me is Radiotherapy a dodle compared to chemotherapy? Also I am due to start my Hormone tablets, after reading some of the emails on here i'm not looking forward to starting the side effects of them either, does anyone have any info about them, I know symtoms are individual, but anything would help. Hope to hear from you all, and hope you all have a great day. Gill  xxx",

      "Content": "Thanks for replying Debra, will have to get me some of that cream, I have aloe vera gel all over my house (i use it for treatment on kids, cuts and stuff) but having extra creams around always comes in handy. Yes the tired bit makes sense haha, sorry had to snigger to myself, as long as it's normal tired I can cope with that. I recieve free prescriptions as well so dont think i need the form, but will check just in case. Thanks again for the positive info, you have put my mind at ease.   Gill  xx",
