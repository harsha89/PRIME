    "Content": "Hi I post in the kidney section, and just saw your questions in passing. A CT scan preferably with contrast would be the most effective method to monitor tumour and lymph node change.  I don't believe that anything else possibly other than an MRI with contrast, would be as definitive. Re your comment on not completing chemotherapy.  I communicate with a fellow kidney patient and her chemo regime was ended due to the same circumstances, and less further in than you, ie probably about half way through.  She felt really down as you currently are. However, she is 7 years cancer and treatment free after a really poor prognosis for a rare and aggressive kidney cancer. So take heart, and good luck.",
