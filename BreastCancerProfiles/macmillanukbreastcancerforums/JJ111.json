    "Content": "Hi all I have been taking Letrozole for 5 years and have recently been discharged from secondary care to primary care (GP) I have been advised to continue taking Letrozole for another 5 years. At the beginning I tried several brands of Letrozole and ended up with Accord.  I can sympathize with those ladies trying different brands, persivere you will find the best one. For me the side effects have not gone away I just tolerate and manage them.  Good luck ",
