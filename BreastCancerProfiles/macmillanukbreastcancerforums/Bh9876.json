      "Content": "Hi. Am new to this site. I have had a lump in my left breast for almost 4 weeks now. A nurse examined me first and a doctor a few days later. The nurse said it was hard and fixed in place and so didn\u2019t feel like a cyst. The gp didn\u2019t say much about it but sent an urgent referral to the breast cancer clinic, as my mother had breast cancer when she wasn\u2019t much older than me. Thankfully she had a mastectomy, no further treatment and was on Tamoxifen for 5 years. That was 20 years ago and she has not had cancer since.  I have an appointment for Thursday morning to see the consultant, have a scan and a biopsy.  My mind has gone in a million different directions the last few weeks. My husband passed away when my children were small and I worry about how they will cope if I am diagnosed with breast cancer.  I am trying to think positive, that the nurse may have been wrong and it\u2019s just a cyst. Or that if it is breast cancer that it is early stages. I am usually healthy but have had non stop colds and coughs since last September. It could be related or it could be that I started a job working as an early years teacher a year ago now and my body is around small children full of cold and catching everything going.  I get the occasional jab of pain in the left breast and it can be itchy at times. But no skin changes to the breast. Just the lump which is goes from the breast bone in the middle of my breasts towards the nipple. Gp said it was pea sized but feels bigger to me.  Just nervous about the results and needed to chat with people who have \u2018been there\u2019 whatever the outcome. ",

Wednesday I have a plumber coming to fix the leaky tap in my bathroom and then Thursday is my appointment. So hopefully keeping busy up until that date!  Thank you for the warm cyber hugs :-) ",
