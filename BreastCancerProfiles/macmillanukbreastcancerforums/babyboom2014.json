      "Content": "That you are getting better is the most important thing.So what if you have gained a little extra pounds.During treatment no matter what you eat or do your weight can be affected.I have been on steroids on and off for a while and they make you feel hungry all the time,and I have got bigger than I would like,but glad I haven't been losing loads of weight because of treatment and I have remained strong enough for treatment.It won't last for ever,and you can tackle the weight gain after you have fully recovered If still feel that you need to.If you haven't tried look good,feel good pamper session,I advice you do.It is a day where you are shown how to apply makeup,recieve free makeup and perfume in a goody bag etc.It's just what you need to get back in touch with your old self and feel good about you like you deserve.It is a lovely day for me time,and the staff and women you meet are great.Glad you are getting better.TXXX",

      "Content": "Trick is to think do I care about this person and what they think?Also no one has the right to to express their opinion if it makes you feel bad about yourself,on some days you can manage that all on your own.Often there is noone  that is ever going to be as harsh as you are to yourself,but wouldn't dream of judging anyone else like that.Say to the rude people who mention you have gained a little weight during treatment,thanks for the words of support,during this crappy time for me I need all the boosting up I can get.Smile sweetly and watch your meaning hit home.I'm betting the subject won't come up again lol.Or if you are too polite to reprimand,a vision of drop kicking the thoughtless bigmouth might stem the need to reproach them and bring a smile to your face.Let them wonder what you are smiling about lmao",
