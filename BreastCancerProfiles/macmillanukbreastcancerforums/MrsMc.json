      "Content": "Hi - I feel like I am reading a post I put on as I am exactly the same, I found my lump and had a biopsy and then lumpectomy. At first they hoped it was a DCIS but they found invasive cancer grade 3 - I am also negative for all 3 hormone drugs so saw the oncologist on Thursday and will be starting 6 cycles of chemo over 18 weeks follows by 6 weeks of radiotherapy. Have my wig appointment next week and just trying to work out how to explain to my 2 year old why mummy won't have hair!",
