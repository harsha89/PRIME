I also went on a look good feel good course which was great, learnt lots and fab freebies. Next week I am starting a course of massage with cancer care to help me sleep better  Today I have been to my oncologist she was very patient with my ridiculously long list of questions  sorted bloods to confirm where I am on menopause and requested an ultrasound to put my mind at rest that it was gone ❤ answered all my questions and advised don't cut out dairy said tamoxifen only reduces my risk slightly so might only take it for five years as after five risk of womb cancer increase but is still very very low risk so I need to believe all that and keep everything crossed that this is a start of a new life. So bloods Monday then again in six weeks then ultrasound , bit of an m.o.t. see surgeon again in next few weeks for a follow up. I am now back full time at work instead of working at home,there is light at the end of the tunnel and I am feeling like my old self.
