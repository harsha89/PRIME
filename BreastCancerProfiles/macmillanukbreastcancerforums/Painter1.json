      "Content": "Hi, just read your post. I have finished all my treatment. I was diagnosed in November 2014 with her2 breast cancer. I had herceptin but finished mine in January 2016. I was fine and didn't have any side effects with the herceptin. But what I would like to say is it's a combination of all the treatment, chemo,  surgery, radiotherapy , And the journey through cancer it's self that has a knock effect on the body and mind. It does get better but takes a long time to get back to the new you normal self. You never peddle back to how you were before you found out you had cancer but you discover a new stronger person within yourself. I have just had my second anniversary since being diagnosed 2 years ago. I look forward to the future . It took me a year and half to feel good after fatigue etc. ",

      "Content": "Hi just seen your post. I had her2 positive breast cancer. I have finished most of my treatment just on herceptin unitil February and another operation beginning of 2016. I have decided on some life style changes.  I am taking time out and not working. I have been vegetable juicing for quite a while and cutting back on diary food. Generally I am looking at a more healthier lifestyle . Just started swimming and spinning classes again but at a slower pace and listening to my body. Tried Pilates and would like to join a yoga class. I am using almond , coconut and koko diary free milk. Mostly organic vegetables. Drinking ginger & lemon tea , green tea and organic tea. Also spending time out on my hobby more. ",

      "Content": "Hi  I had my first mammogram since breast cancer was diagnosed a year ago. I just had two images done on my  left breast has I knew I couldn't have it on my reconstructed breast . I thought though you might have an ultra sound to check underarm where lymph nodes were removed and scar tissue on breast . I don't really know has this is the first time since treatment has ended. I did get a yearly passport to book in every year for five years, and then I was told its up to your oncologist if it continues yearly. Is this the normal thing ?",
