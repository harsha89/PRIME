      "Content": "Hi Judy Thank you for your reply, so sorry your having such problems with your stomach, they certainly don't tell you much about these problems that can accur, I remember when I went for my check up at 6 weeks with my surgeon and I asked him how long it would be before the numbness went in my stomach, and he said that it will always be numb and thought this was explained at the time, funny don't remember that bit. I find that my stomach is lovely and flat when I get up in the mornings but by bed time I find that where the scar is i seem to get a pot belly look, surgeon did say that where all the muscles etc are disturbed during the op the natural fluid drainage tends to filter down the sides of your stomach instead of the middle and that I should massage from the outside towards the middle everyday, I have been using a slender tone ab belt every day for half and hour Which is the same as doing 150 sit ups which has helped to wake up the deep inner muscles and keep my stomach tight, I don't have the pulling pain that I used to get when I turned over in bed anymore so think that maybe this ab belt has helped, I do still have lots of lumpy bits along the scar but they say that it can take over a year to go, but with regards to your pain I haven't experience that, have they checked that it's not scaring that has formed around the internal stitches that could be causing it as I did get some of that earlier on, felt like someone was sticking the end of a pointed knife in my stomach Did they also check that you haven't developed a hernia that could be causing you this pain. Hope they get you sorted, let me know how you get on. Good luck",

      "Content": "I had a right skin sparring mx last September with immediate reconstruction using Diep flap, which went well, although recovery was hard for the first few weeks, as couldnt stand up straight for first 6 weeks. Had my nipple reconstruction on 29 Jan using the centre of the flap however went back 10 days later (last week) to have the dressing and stitches removed, and the nurse said that part of it has blistered and the skin has died, it has turned black, she got one of the plastics doctors to have a look but he didnt seem to concerned I have an appointment to see my plastic surgeon on 12 March, however it just now looks like a hugh black wart sitting there and the top looking down on it is still a gaping wound which still bleeds and is sticky most of the time, bits of the black dead hard skin is coming away, and the only bit that is still soft flesh is now going flat, I am so disappointed and the whole breast now just looks horible as it seems to have altered the shape from being nice and round to being rather flat on top where the nipple is. Has any one else had this problem and what happened, not sure what they will do next, beginning to wonder now if I should have just gone without the nipple. Seems such a pain that to go through the major surgery without too many problems, then to have this happen with the minor side.        ",
