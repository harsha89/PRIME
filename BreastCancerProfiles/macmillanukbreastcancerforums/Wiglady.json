      "Content": "Hello, I have IDC too and had FEC-T from Nov to March. I usually felt rubbish the 1st week after chemo and then better the following 2 weeks. The more water you can drink, the better. It really helped me in the 1st few days. Hot flushes are quite strange, aren't they?! The only thing I could do was take the covers off and put them back on. My hair fell out after about 10 days, unfortunately there was not much I could do so I had it shaved by the hairdresser who also helped me choose a wig straight away. I am now 2 months post chemo and I go out without my wig. My hair is very short but I was amazed how fast it started growing as soon as FEC was finished. Good luck, it's not a walk in the park but it's got to be done! Xxx",

We are also due Ofsted anytime soon but given the ordeal I've just been through with the treatment, I see Ofsted from a different perspective now, they don't scare me as much as chemo did! I am going to do 3 mornings after half term and see how I feel. I have a meeting with occupational health soon. Xxxx",

I kind of think perhaps I should do 3 mornings in the first week and slowly increase until I can do full time before the end of this school year to see if I can cope. What is your experience of going back to school?",
