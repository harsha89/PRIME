      "Content": "Certainly having BC sorts out some of your old friendships and creates surprising new ones. People we hardly knew gave my OH and I great support, especially in helping to keep our small business running, which we relied on for income. The wonderful volunteer drivers from the local Royal Voluntary Service team took me to every one of my 25 radiotherapy sessions and brought me home, as I wasn\u2019t well enough to drive and OH had broken his leg, typical! We worked out that by the time of my last session, we had covered over 1200 miles! The drivers also became my friends and patient listeners when I was finding things hard. Old friends began to get rather bored with all the cancer stuff I think. Some made me feel as if I was some type of fraud almost because I didn\u2019t have chemo. I was borderline for this, as my nodes were not affected although I was Grade 3 invasive. My onc felt that my age, 63 and previous health issues meant that the risks outweighed the benefits. I do wonder now whether I would have had the recurrence if I\u2019d had it. So many difficult decisions to be made on the BC journey sometimes. ",

      "Content": "Hi there. I\u2019m new to the forum. Diagnosed with Grade 3 invasive breast cancer in Jan 15, had 3 lumpectomies and 25 rads, no chemo fortunately. In July last year I had a recurrence in the same breast,  Paget\u2019s disease of the nipple and had a mastectomy. A \u2018friend\u2019 who I hadn\u2019t Seen for a year or so came to visit me and her opening remark was \u2018gosh haven\u2019t you gone grey\u2019! My OH couldn\u2019t resist saying \u2018but at least she still has her own teeth\u2019, as we knew friend had dentures! Got to laugh, needless to say we haven\u2019t seen her since! ",
