      "Content": "People kept telling me how strong I was too and I couldn't understand why they thought that.  I was told I had two Stage 3 tumours, offered a lumpectomy, chemotherapy, radiotherapy then Tamoxifen and of course I said yes to them all.  Of course you're going to choose life!  Someone did explain to me, though, that the side effects of chemotherapy were so horrific (for me anyway, I know everyone's different and don't want to scare anybody) that a weaker person may have been having panic attacks and breathing into a paper bag at the thought of their next cycle of treatment!  Bit extreme, I know, but it kinda made me understand that people saw me as being strong because I faced up to it.  In my view, I had no choice.  I think everyone who faces cancer is unbelievably brave. I've been off work since the beginning of April and hope to return part-time in December - the whole of this month is being taken up with radiotherapy.  Maybe I'm being overly ambitious! It helps reading everyone's postings, would be nice if my boss and everyone else out there maybe read this website now and again!   Joan",

      "Content": "Hi Susan I had a lumpectomy for two Stage 3 tumours in March and have just finished chemotherapy.  My oncologist wouldn't allow me to fly - we ended up going over to Ireland by ferry!  Oncologist actually told me that, if it was her, she would be going NOWHERE!  I had quite a fight on my hands, had to promise to do my homework re. where the nearest GP/hospital would be in relation to our hotel, make sure I had my yellow chemotherapy card with me at all times... I had FEC chemo - not sure if it matters what type you have.  Good luck, would be a real shame to miss France.  And maybe your treatment will be over by then, do you know how many sessions you've to have?  I had 6, each one 3 weeks apart. Hope it works out all right for you.   Joan x",

And scary when I saw blood in the loo (not nice, sorry!).   Glad you saw your GP and glad you've got cream.  The chemotherapy gave me terrible constipation, I found I couldn't live without lactulose, thankfully it's quite pleasant to take :)   Joan",

      "Content": "Oh yes, most definitely connected to the chemo - like you, I hadn't had \"piles\" since I was pregnant. I know what you mean about the thought of getting a suppository inside but, honestly, it was surprisingly easy.  Is the cream you have anugesic HC?  Ordinary anusol cream just didn't work for me but when my GP prescribed anugesic HC it made a huge difference.  Check what cream you have and maybe ask your GP for something stronger.  The pain's like toothache, a constant throbbing, I couldn't bear it either.   Joan x",

Good luck, I know how awful it can be - I went down to dinner in a hotel one night and had to balance on one cheek for the entire meal - nightmare!   Joan x",

      "Content": "Thanks Colin, Anything that improves survival rates has got to be worth a go.  I've only been taking them for 6 days now so will wait and see what happens. I'm going for my CT scan on Thursday to have the \"tattoo\" marks so that they know where to localize the treatment, I wouldn't say I'm all that worried about it, but don't doubt that the daily trek to hospital for an entire month will be tiring! Thanks, too, for letting me know there are alternative drugs, hopefully I won't need to switch :)   Joan  ",

      "Content": "Thanks Kate, and don't worry about scaring me, I'd rather know than not know, if you see what I mean! I had an early menopause, so have been having hot flushes and night sweats for a couple of years now and, although I hate them, I've gotten used to them.  I don't suppose a few more will make that much difference! Re. the dryness, my boyfriend of 2 1/2 years just dumped me - he couldn't handle the cancer - so I won't be too bothered about that for a while!  When the day does come that I need to,  I'll ask my doctor for some Sylk - will write that name down 'cos I've already learnt that GPs seem to have limited knowledge when it comes to things like hormone drugs. Thanks again - and I have noted that the side effects are only possibilities.   Joan  ",

Two operations, now you need a mastectomy and you may have both done?  I take my hat off to you, I honestly do, and I hope everything goes well.   Joan x",
