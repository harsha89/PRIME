      "Content": "I had a mastectomy on my left side in September 2012, with immediate reconstruction using implant. Fortunately I did not need chemo or radiotherapy.  The scar never fully healed after the skin became necrotic fairly soon after surgery, and it was constantly discharging.  I have been back to see the surgeon numerous times, but he just kept telling me to put on dry dressings. .  There is now a huge hole in my breast with the implant poking through, plus constant discharge, so the implant has now gone so badly wrong that it has to come out, so I am  going in for surgery with my PS tomorrow  to remove the implant.   I will have to wait a few weeks or months for it to heal up, but I am undecided about what to do next - do I just leave it flat (probably not, as I like to have some sort of cleavage and could not be bothered with prothesis etc).  However, I am unsure whether to try another implant, or whether to have something more drastic such as a DIEP.  I am not too keen on having a long recovery period again, having got my life back on track, and getting back to work.  However, I would like to hear from anyone who has had to have an implant removed, and what they decided to do next.   I am a private patient but my insurance company will not pay for any \"revision\" as they call it, so whatever I decide to do I will have to pay for it, which could affect my decision somewhat, depending on the cost of the various procedures.  ",

      "Content": "I have also had problems with a reconstruction.  I had left MX September 2012 with immediate reconstruction with silicone implant.  From the start the reconstruction did not look right; it was smaller than my other breast, but the surgeon kept saying he could reduce the size of the other - which I did not want as there was nothing wrong with it and I was happy with it's size.  The reconstructed breast felt uncomfortable, very tight and was pressing on my breast bone, and really did not look good undressed, as it was bruised and the skin looked as though it had been pulled too tight.  A few weeks after surgery the wound (in the middle where the nipple had been) became necrotic and black and discharged, and this went on for several months.  It seemed to heal for a short period, but then opened up again and started discharging badly a month or so ago.  During the whole time since my MX and reconstruction I had been back to see the surgeon and his nurses many times, and each time was told to keep dressing it and to wait for it to heal, which it never did.  I spent most of the last 7 months with dressings on the reconstructed breast, which I had to change several times a day.  It got so bad and the wound opened up so much that you could see the implant through it.  The surgeon then decided that the only option was to remove the implant, so I had this surgically removed about a month ago.  I do feel much more comfortable now and not in any pain, but am less than happy with having one flat side and having to wear a prosthesis in a special bra.  Even the scar he has left this time is not good-looking, as it is very puckered and the skin has been gathered together, which he said is to leave a bit of skin for another reconstruction.  He said I should wait at least 3 months before another reconstruction, but I am very nervous about having another one as this will be more drastic, and will be either a LD flap or possibly DIEP as he cannot do another implant on it, but because the previous one went so wrong and caused so much discomfort for so many months, I am worried that if I have another done it may not work out and I really cannot take much more pain and suffering.  Although I am feeling very well now and quite fit, I am not happy with how I look.   It is unfortunate to have to suffer breast cancer and it is good that there are options for us such as reconstruction, but it is hard to take when the reconstruction itself causes pain and discomfort.  ",

      "Content": "Hi Katymargaret Don't worry about the critical illness as you should be covered.  They will pay out if the cancer is \"invasive\" which you said yours is.  I had invasive ductal carcinoma, and also DCIS (ductal carcinoma in situ), but the fact that part of it was invasive ensured that this was covered.  I had critical illness cover with 4 different insurance companies and they all paid out, enabling me to almost pay off my mortgage.  Get in touch with the insurance company and tell them you want to make a claim, and they will ask you for some details and tell you if you are covered.  You will need to fill in lots of forms and they will contact your GP/specialist, but once they have the information they will pay out quickly.  I didn't need chemo or radiotherapy, but had a full mastectomy.  Good luck!",
