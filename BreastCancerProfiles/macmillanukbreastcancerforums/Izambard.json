    "Content": "Hi Jediknight,  I struggled with squashes as well - I'm on my FEC, had three T and six FEC eeeek! (Two left to go, then radiotherapy...and surgery...)  Have you tried sirops? The french style ones, brands like Tesserie I found good, in flavours like passionfruit, grenadine, cherry and pink grapefruit - they tasted less chemically then squashes for me. Waitrose sells them, I found them smoother and easier to drink (needed them to be icy cold!) as high fruit squash texture was not good, and other smooth squashes like ribena had horrid aftertaste (probs due to all the additives!).  I find fresh berries good to eat but that is pretty much it (don't fill me up but hey ho) With you on the lack of tastebuds, to me it is worse then any aches and pains - food still smells good, just tastes of nothing. People are like 'oh that will fade, i cant be too bad - better then aches or being sick...' To be honest for me it is worse! I love my food! Iz xx Stage IV Breast Cancer / 28 Years Old",
