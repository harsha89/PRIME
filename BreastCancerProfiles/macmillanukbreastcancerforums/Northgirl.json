    "Content": "Hello, So I was diagnosed with invasive ductile carcinoma 4 weeks ago and had wire guided wide excision and 3 lymph nodes removed yesterday.  And for me, this hasn't been a bad experience at all.  I was treated at Raigmore and honestly the NHS has pulled out all the stops and everyone has been brilliant - no pussy footing around, no sugar coating, efficient and effective treatment.  I am already off pain killers and can lift arm above head - just a little stiff - like after a hard work out on pecs.  Haven't taken off dressings yet - wounds probably look horrendous because of blue dye (used to locate lymph nodes).  But for anyone anticipating lumpectomy I would say don't worry (I was really scared, having never been to hospital before) - if your experience is anything like mine it isn't bad at all.  I think treatments are so much better nowadays because such a lot of money is invested in breast cancer care.  I still have rad therapy (maybe also chemo) to go but I'm not really worried now after seeing how experienced NHS are at treating this.",
