I have grade 2 ductal and seem to have had the exact procedure as you.I finished my treatment last December and returned to work in February but tried to run before I could walk. I know its hard and frustrating but do try and take it at your own pace and ask for help when you need to. Give your body time to adjust as you have been through so much physically and emotionally. I still get tired and angry at times but I suppose its all part of the healing process. Im having a preventative mastectomy next week so will be out of action for a while again and as they say, prevention is better than a cur. o take care and keep strong. Love Jackie x",
