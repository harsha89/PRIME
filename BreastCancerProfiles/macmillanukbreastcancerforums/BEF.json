      "Content": "Hi there. I've taken Tamoxifen Anastrozole Examestane and now Letrozole. After chemo 6 years ago my hair remained thin in the front. Careful colouring thickens it but I agree it gets me done too. I'm now on Zometa infusions for bone mets which again causes thining. Just remember you are who you are because of your illness not inspire of it. Chin up BEF xx",

      "Content": "Good morning. From past experience - mastectomy 6 years ago I would suggest wearing sports bra day and night for a good month. It's fine to bath but not to wet dressings so flannel only for top half. Will be bliss in a couple of weeks to shower properly. Be aware of any build up of fluid that may need to be removed from back as the drain wasn't in long. Hope you have a good recovery time and take advantage of the sun!",

      "Content": "Hi Anne.   I always drove myself the 40 mins to chemo as I work at same hospital. Was tired by the time I got home and took the rest of the week off. worked the middle two weeks before starting the cycle again. That was 7 years ago. Unfortunately I'm a year since diagnosis with bone metastases but have moved further from work and now travel an hour each way to work and same on treatment days. Plus side treatment is monthly and more gentle. I still work fulltime but have approx 4 days in the month off sick - need to recharge batteries or have some bone pain.  My job is clinical with my own list of patients to diagnose. Remember cancer is life changing not life ending. Travel the extra for better treatment if appropriate and keep your life NORMAL !  Good luck Liz ",
