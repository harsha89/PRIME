    "Content": "Got my blue dye coming next Thursday with WLE, (it's going to be a loooong week)just wondering about the huge difference how one person can 'wipe it off over a few days' and others still have it a year later. Are there two different types? Also worried about nurse saying how ill I will look with it. Thanks x Â ",
