      "Content": "is it common or usual for someone who has been diagnosed with cancer to really push their partner away? I am trying to be supportive in all ways. However, I am being told \"go/leave\" get your life back! Telling me I don't want wait around cancer wards stressing over results for the next twenty years!  I know I am not the one suffering directly but seem to be targeted as bearing the brunt! Just want to know if this is common and what to do? My partner is not forthcoming in disclosing how she is feeling!",

      "Content": "Hi thanks for your reply. The diagnosis came and a lumpectomy was done and then a second surgery to kind of ring fence the tumour. There is a lot of time on her hands for which I cannot fill as work is in the way. I cannot work out whether she is testing my resilience or really means it!  I have said I will be there for her, yet the fear of not recovering is forcing her to come to these decisions.  I have left once to give her space as requested only to be immediately missed and asked to return. I am currently out staying at friends and I am unsure what to do for the best! I hear that splitting up under these circumstances is quite common....and fear that this is the reality. I have not only lost the one I love but 3 kids (not mine) that I love to. My emotions are in turmoil and I feel like I cannot wait around for however long!  I know this may seem selfish but this is the make up of who I am.  It's complicated! I'm confused, I am not sure if she knows what she is doing...trying to save me perhaps!  But surely that is a question that I have to answer! I just don't know and it's dragging me down to a dark place after just recovering from breaking my back! Not sure if it helps or not, except it may help sharing my thoughts.THANKS AGAIN.",

      "Content": "Hi G n J She is awaiting radio therapy which has been delayed once due to an infection from the surgery that needing draining.   Obviously you never know for definite if they will recover.  It was stage two (early I think...it's confusing). But I believe the chances of recovery are fairly good in these circumstances.  However, I can totally understand the death sentence feeling",

      "Content": "Hi again! She has never liked the idea of help from others as she always feels indebted especially after going through a four year divorce.....she has had a real hard time and fully supported me when I had a broken back two years ago.  I don't feel obliged to help or be there as payback I am there because I love her.  I know that she knows that to!  However, I am nearly running scared not because I want to but because of her guilt.  How do I get it across to her!?",
