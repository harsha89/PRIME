      "Content": "hi everyone i just had lumpectomy  for 2cmm grade 3 tumour ihad one positive node and one negative node so they removed all the nodes  the margin came back clear and no spread to other nodes  after discharge from hosp i started bloating out every where the oncologist semms to think its due to an underactive thyroid gland as its now only 6 as opposed to 9  and he said if this not remedied i will not survive the 4and a half months of chemo 3 times a week, is this a standard amount of chemo and has anyone else had similar effects iam worried  has this happened to any one else",
