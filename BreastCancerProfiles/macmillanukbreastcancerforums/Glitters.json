    "Content": "Hi Meg, Sorry to hear the news. At the moment my cancer has returned and I am undergoing some hefty chemo. It affects evrybody differently - psychologically and physically. I think LisaCB has a point.Personally I welcome practical help. Also having some tricky feelings recognised. Iget the most frustrated when some one says to me \"don't worry, things will get better\". Right at that time, it doesn't feel like it. A hugÂ  or just being there is good. Sometimes words aren't that important.I do know that it is difficult for family and friends to deal with. I see it in my husband's face. So I wish you all the best.",
