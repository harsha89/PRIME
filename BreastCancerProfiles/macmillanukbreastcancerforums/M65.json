      "Content": "Hello Jenny, I had a similar problem and eventually discovered the Genie bras which are made of a soft but very supportive material and there are no hooks to do up! You can slip them over your head or if you have restricted arm movement you can pull them up. They also have \"pockets\" to place a supportive cup in or your prosthesis if you have one. I had an immediate reconstruction done after my mx but struggled with normal bras but found the genie bras really comfortable and although I am back in normal bras now after nearly eighteen months I still wear the genie bras at night. You can buy them from High street TV (online shopping) or some of the stores like BHS, Boots and Asda stock them. I hope this helps and wish you well with your recovery. Xx",

If so, has it affected your reconstruction in any way? Mine is a long story, I also had an LD done two years ago but due to a returning tumour have recently had a WLE and will be having radiotherapy too. Xx",

I went to the hospital yesterday for fourth FEC, had a heated wheat bag on my hand and arm on the way there to keep veins warm! The nurse managed to find a reasonable vein and applied some anaesthetic to it first and thankfully it worked...needle went in no problem and treatment went ahead! I was so relieved because I think if it hadn't worked this time I would have just given up....still two more to go! Xx",

It comes in two flavours and you just spray it into your mouth when it is dry and it really helps to put the moisture back into your mouth, I think you can get it on prescription but I just bought it because I felt quite desperate, used to wake up gagging at night! You can also get some pastilles to suck which are supposed to do a similar thing but I cannot remember what these were called. It is a good idea to see if there is a Macmillan trained pharmacist at a Boots store somewhere near you because they seem to be very knowledgeable and helpful in cancer related matters....found mine more useful than the chemo nurse! She was also able to suggest things for my dry eyes, my nose ( a little coating of vaseline just inside your nostrils helps with the dryness and acts as a barrier in place of the nose hairs that have gone!) and stuff to help with my bowel problems! Hope this is of some help to you. All the best xx",

The chemo nurse tried seven different veins but each time she put the needle in, the vein just seemed to shrink and she wasn't getting any \"flashback\" as she put it. I finally had enough and asked her to stop trying....came home feeling very upset with a very painful arm covered in bruises! I am supposed to go again tomorrow to try again but am so worried....arm doesn't seem to have recovered yet....what if she can't get the needle in again?! Has anyone else experienced this? She did mention Picc line but said it was probably late to do this? Has anyone had this and how did you manage with it? Also said she had once put the treatment into a patients foot! I get lymphoeadma in the other other arm so don't want that to be touched! Any thoughts or advice greatly appreciated. Xx",

I haven't had many problems with the Metformin, it did upet my stomach for a few weeks at first and I also had a metallic taste in my mouth but nothing too worrying. I was put on tamoxifen for five years but found the side effects of that quite unbearable and decided to stop taking it after discussing with my surgeon....the benefits of it were not enough to make a big difference in my case. Also the long term effects of being a diabetic combined with the side effects of the tamoxifen were not worth taking a risk in my case....So maybe the Metformin may help me instead! Good luck with the trial and all the best for the New Year x",

Anyone else had this problem? Also, when I was at the chemist yesterday discussing this problem with the pharmacist (who turns out to be Macmillan trained) she asked about the colour of my stools?! When I told her they have been black ever since I started the FEC treatment she seemed quite concerned and told me to get in touch with the oncologist! I had never thought to mention this to him before because I thought it was just all due to the drugs....should I be worried? Anyone else have the same? I know it's not a pleasant topic but I would really appreciate some advice on this! Thanks :) xx",

However, over the year the muscle did shrink a fair bit and the size of the breast reduced so I did not have to have any surgery on the other side.....I had also been told that I may need a reduction on the good side to match up. I have recently lost some weight and both breasts have gone down a cup size and still look well matched, I was a 34DD and now 32D. I have to be honest and say that I am still having problems with my back scar and in constant pain/discomfort....back at physio and having electro acupuncture done, there are days when I wish I had just stuck to having an mx as I can't move on with these ongoing problems. I would allow yourself some more time, my surgeon told me to wait at least six months before everything settled down size wise. Wishing you all the best. Xx",

I had a mastectomy and immediate LD reconstruction in September and had accepted what had happened to me and been quite positive up until the operation. After it, I really struggled (am still struggling on some days) to accept my new body and have thought that I made the wrong choice of op. In the last few weeks I was beginning to feel better in myself but last week I started taking the tamoxifen and by the end of the week I kept bursting into tears without really knowing why!! I too thought it may be the effect of the tamoxifen or the fact that now the all the hospital appointments, etc., have stopped for a while that I have finally begun to realise what has happened to me and what the long term implications of it are on the rest of my life. Please don't feel alone in dealing with this, talk to your GP or BCN, it may help to have some counselling which is the route I am going to take...there is help out there and you don't have to struggle by yourself.
