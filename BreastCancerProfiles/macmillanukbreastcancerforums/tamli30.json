      "Content": "Hello Clair, I had responsed to your post as i have also been diagnosed, on 5th Jan this year, with BC and am 30 and like you and also thought i was also fit and healthy. I thought that you would be someone we could both relate to as i do not know anyone else in my age group who has ever had this, very schocking isnt it and weird when you dont feel ill but know you are. I've just had the small op to have one lymph node taken out, you may or may not be at the stage yet. My auntie also currently has the same thing so she is passing on things for me to know as i go along each stage. Anyway if you feel like or are able to get back to me then please do. I am sure that like me you have a ton of appoinments lined up.   best wishes. Tamli30x",

I had two mouth infections and now need daily blood thinning injections. If there's anything specific you want to know, just message me.   Tamlixx",
