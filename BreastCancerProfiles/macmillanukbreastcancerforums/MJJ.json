    "Content": "I am so sorry to read re your struggles. Thank you for sharing it as other folk will relate to it. You have had an awful time health wise over past number of years. Sounds like you and your husband are both struggling with it possibly grieving over the changes this has made to your lives, from how it was before. It is hard to get that balance re how to pace yourself and he must find that hard as well as keeps telling you not to overdo it. Perhaps might help to sit down together when things are calmer and chat about things. It may be that you make a list of things and start slow. Won't be anything big initially but little things will make a difference. Although you may not think he is supporting you, if he wasn't there it is then you realise the things that he has been doing. Take care. MJJ",
