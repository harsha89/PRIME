      "Content": "Hi there Prior to my first chemo (EC) I went and visited the chemo suite which was a really good thing to do as you know a bit more about what you're letting yourself in for. If you can and, if it's appropriate for you, take someone with you...it really helps and the chemo staff are really accommodating and understand how important it is to have support. I didn't feel nauseous at all and ended up handing in my anti-nausea tablets. However, if you do...let the staff know ASAP as there are lots of different ones that can be tried. Re. the cool cap...not all hospitals have them...I don't think Christie's or Liverpool do. I did cool cap and, eventhough I lost a fair amount, I felt it was worth it. For me it was also psychological and I felt I was doing all I could to help things. Eventhough it does put an extra few hours on your treatment it can also help particularly if you get hot flushes from steroids. My hair started growing back half way through my chemo and with avengeance. Hope all goes well for you on Wednesday...I'm sure you'll get wonderful medical care and the other patients you will be priveleged to meet are amazing and another important source of strength.      ",

      "Content": "You're welcome...take all the support you can get at this difficult time for you. Really glad you saw the suite...it makes it so much easier knowing what you're walking in to and to see all the other real people receiving treatment. Try and remember this - you're a patient and not a victim and this is all part of you getting better. And whatever slightly unpleasant things happen...they're only temporary. All the very best!",

      "Content": "I had my op and treatment last year and finished everything mid-July. I didn't have many problems during treatment (v. fortunate) but have really been struggling mentally since. Have heard numerous stories of this happening to others. Have just got myself referred for some Cognitive Behavioural Therapy which I am so hoping will help. Does anyone else know of or have similar experiences?",
