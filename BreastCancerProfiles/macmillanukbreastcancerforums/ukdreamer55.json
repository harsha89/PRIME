      "Content": "hi hun , i had the tram flap about 10 year ago and i found it the best for me. i did'nt fancy the LD flap as i thought it would be too uncomfortable having a scar on my back and front. i find the part under arm is a little numb but the rest of the bresat is fine ans if you rub plenty of cream onto the breast after it heals the scars hardley show. i had 2 drains in my chest it was a little uncomfortable untill the drains were removed but i healed very quickly and with not having a scar on my back i was able to sleep quite well whilst healing. i find the breast is a little heavier than my normal one but with a decent bra it is comfy enough. i hope this is of help to you. love doreen keep ya chin up xxx",
