    "Content": "Hi Ceecee152, Congrats on finishing your treatment. I was diagnosed June \u201815. I had a lumpectomy, chemo & radiation. I\u2019m on Letrozole as well since Feb. \u201816 & my hair has thinned a lot. I\u2019m nervous because I may have to be on this for perhaps 10 years the medical community is recommending now. So I\u2019m not sure but it may get worse by then. I\u2019m looking into trying to keep what I have. I do take a supplement for nails & hair. Best wishes to you & continued good health.",
