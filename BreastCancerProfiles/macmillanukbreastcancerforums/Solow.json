      "Content": "Hi Grogg Thank you for your reply and for making me smile, my husband is trying so hard for me. I see the oncologist on 13th November. It seems such a long way off. I feel like I am losing my mind. I am so scared he will say it has spread and that its untreatable. I thought I would grow old with mu husband and children and now I cannot see a future with me in it.  My children are taking exams soon and I worry that this will affect that badly too. Although must say they are being braver than me. I am being such a weed.",

I have had the scans, waiting to see the oncologist for results.  I know what your hubby means, I just want to be me again.  Just waiting while this thing is in me is horrible. Xx",

Still waiting to see oncologist for scan results and treatment plan.  Everyone  says that it gets better once you are on the treatment road. Let's hope so. Wishing you well.",

The constant fear is so difficult to live with isn't it. I am trying to separate my life and my fear. Hubby says it will probably get easier once I start treatment.

I am not eating, sleeping, can't seem to think about anything else. This is only going to make it worse, I know, but I can't yet find a way through it to live as near normal as possible.  We have sixth form open evenings to attend all this week, but I don't think I can go. I can't really sit there shaking and crying, but I feel so bad leaving them to deal with it alone. They are obviously upset and worried too and I am causing them even more worry. If only they would get on with my treatment, at least then I will feel I am fighting back. It's good to hear yours had not spread and I hope your scan goes well. Sounds like you have a strong hubby. ",

I did not mean to reject it. I can't get the hang of this and only find my messages by clicking around practically everything and find it by chance - doh! Your post was lovely to read. I too have been to all my children's things and last night I just could not be with all those people packed into a school hall. Imagine if I had had a panic attack then. I went to the doctor yesterday and she has given me sleeping tablets and diazepam. I can't believe I have sunk this low. It feels like I have some horrible alien inside me and I can't get it out. It feels like I am never going to be me and capable again. Have become very dependant on my husband to do meals, shopping etc and that's just not me. I hate it when he goes to work and I feel so vulnerable. I am so sorry, you are being encouraging and I am being so wet. I really do wish you well.",

Nurse phoned me late yesterday to say they have moved my oncology appointment to this morning. So I find out today whether or not it has spread and whatever else they tell you then. I am very mixed about this. Finally, I will find out, but part of me wants to run and hide away in case things are even worse. And the weather is miserable, the shower packed up last night, my daughter thinks she may have done badly in an exam yesterday and she did not feel well either - aaaggghh! Could not deal with shower as we had to go to a school open evening. Have we not got enough to deal with.",
