    "Content": "Hi Chloe, I have been doing Gerson therapy on & off for the past 17 years or so, ever since my primary tumour was removed & neg nodes in 1998. It was 2 to 3cm & grade 3! I was told I'd be lucky to live 5 years without conventional adjuvants, but I refusedÂ after reading an article in Positive Health magazine by Beata Bishop. I then read several other books, the first & most influential being Cathy Hitchcock & Steve Austin - Every you need to know but what the doc's don't tell you about Breast cancer (or something like that!). Then I read A Time to Heal by Beata Bishop & met other's on Gerson. I have had several local recurrences & just had another lumpectomy each time & I'm do back to have some more out :-( But my overall health & immune system is good as long as I stick to the therapy. It hasn't really worried me about it coming back locally cos it can be removed & monitored. It's when it metastizes you have to worry & it wont do that while my immune system is kept strong through nutrition & cleansing. Don't know anything about your therapy, but I'll research it now, sounds fascinating. Good to meet you x",
