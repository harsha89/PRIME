      "Content": "Hi there everyone, This is my first post. I'm 22 which every doctor on the planet has told me is incredibly young to be going through this. But here I am 3 days post my first chemo and feeling pretty rubbish. I haven't met or spoken to anyone in a similar situation and I thought why not give it a go. It can't make things any worse and maybe it will make me feel less alone. I am currently on the maximum dose of FEC for my first three treatments then swapping to taxotere for the last three so that I can start herceptin. Once chemo is done I will have surgery then rads and also tamoxifen. I'm finding FEC pretty tough going and can't believe I have to do this another 5 times. I'm trying really hard to stay positive but even this feels like an effort at the moment. Does anyone have any tips for me? Or words of advice. I'm trying to view this year as a journey. Maybe I will meet some new friends along the way!!",

      "Content": "Hello lovely ladies. My name is Laura. I'm 22 and I was diagnosed with breast cancer in November. I have started writing a blog. Today I was brave enough to share it with my friends. It seems to be getting lots of positive feedback. Please give it a read. It may help with a few things or at the very least I hope it will make you laugh. I want to help as many people as possible and feel that sharing my story is the least I can do. We need to raise awareness that young girls can unfortunately get this nasty disease too. Please share my blog with your daughters and granddaughters and get them to share it with their friends. It's very light hearted and fairly easy to read. It would also mean a lot to me to get some feedback from you lovely ladies too!! http://lauralouiseandhernaughtydisease.blogspot.co.uk/?m=1 Google Laura Louise and her naughty disease. Sending all the positive vibes I have to you all",
