    "Content": "I got diagnosed a month ago with breast cancer and also.in my lymph node,   they took a biopsy which i waited for 3 weeks to be told  i need it done again as they didn't go deep enough or had gone behind the lump in my breast,  i had my second one last week,  i am still waiting for the results of this.  I feel abandoned really,  i have rang and left messages with my consultants secretary,  she didnt reply after saying she would.  I have tried contacting my breast care nurse and only get the answering machine each time.  I was told from being diagnosed that i would have my surgery in 4 to 6 weeks time and its not far off that now,  but i have no info and no answers to anything other than what is personally looked at online.  It worries me that i need this nasty cancer out of me now,  the longer i wait the more i think is it growing,  is it making my chance of survival less!  I also have noticed signs of depression setting in,  im lucky enough to have a loving supportive husband and family i couldnt imagine going through this alone",
