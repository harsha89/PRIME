Won't lie I'm freaking out and getting waves of anxiety. I just need tomorrow out the way so I have a better idea of what's going on.  Many many thanks",

      "Content": "I really hope I've posted this in the right section, sorry if it's not, I have just registered and not sure where to add! Found a lump to top part of left breast whilst pregnant with my daughter. (Nearly 3 yrs ago)  As I was quite poorly due to over stimulating to IVF drugs, I brushed it off as all I was concerned about at that time, was making sure I saw my pregnancy through to the end so I could (finally) hold my precious girl in my arms. Fast forward to last Monday and I go to get in the shower and I realise I have thick, dark discharge coming out of my right breast. Still forgetting about this lump on my right breast, I visited the gp same day and the first thing she said was \"how long have you had that?\" Looking at the lump on the top of ny left breast. she spent ages examining it. Wasn't until she was mid way to writing g the referal that she remembered the discharge and swiftly asked me if I could produce a sample of it. (But on the boob?!) I have a mamogram booked for tomorrow morning. The past few days have been a roller coaster. I've been saying to my partner for months that I think something isn't right and I was sure there was some something with me. I have also been seeing a chiropractor for an awful dull pain between my shoulder blades for months with no relief.  All that said, I would like to know what will happen tomorrow pls as have so many questions. * will they only do biopsy if they do think it's cancerous? Or do they do that routinely anyway to rule out? * mum said they are likely to do an ultrasound rather than a mamogram due to me being 38? Are both equally affective in diagnosis? * how many of you guys were told straight away to expect the worst? Were any diagnosed there and then?  * my mum will be with me but as I think there will be a lot to take in (if is bad news) do you think they would let me record it on ny phone? (I remember when I had my ectopic pregnancy I still don't know if my right overy was taken with my tube as it was a life/death situation and my head wasn't in any fit state to listen to the surgeon after op) * did anyone else just 'feel' like something wasn't right and have that feeling of knowing before being diagnosed or Is this normal to expect the worst?  I know I sound very negative but I have added a whole bunch of other symptoms to the list over the last few days. Things my partner has told reminded me about and it's all too fitting. Sorry for rambling on, OH keeps dismissing everything i say so I kind of need to air! Thank you ",
