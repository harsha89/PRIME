    "Content": "Dear Jammyfiona.  What a truly lovely letter to write to yourself - so positive but there is only room for a positive attitude in order to survive. I dont think anyone can get through this experience if they are negative because you have to fight. I have found so many positives throughout the treatment. I am stronger than I knew,  I used to be depressed but I have never been happier than now. I made changes in my life and there are more I will make. Funny enough I lived most of my life with depression and mental ill health but during the fight to live  I discovered that I loved life and I liked who I had become. How lucky am I ! The people you meet on your journey can become lifelong true friends. You are right life isnt fair but when bad things happen how you face it can make you a truly amazing person.",
