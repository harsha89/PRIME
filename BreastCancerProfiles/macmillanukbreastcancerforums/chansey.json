      "Content": "hiya lellis...i was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2008 and had all my treatment private, my husband's policy at work covered all the family....the treatment was excellent but like many others who replied...I was alone most of the time, I didn't even have a breast care nurse....I thought all this was normal until this year....I'm separated now and have been diagnosed with secondary breast cancer in my lungs...I'm on the NHS and they have been really good with me...I have a breast care nurse, I have a lung cancer nurse and my doctor has arranged a Macmillan nurse for us who I'll be meeting next week.  Also, I have the same oncologist as I did when I originally had treatment so he knows my history.... best wishes, jackie xx",
