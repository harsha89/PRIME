    "Content": "hello, We have recently been told my partners job will be moving to Switzerland in 6 months. I was diagnosed with local reaccurance breast cancer in November 2018. In order for me to love out there on a permanent basis with him I will need medical insurance. At the moment I am not planning on going on a full time basis but I will eventually. Does anyone have any experience of moving abroad after breast cancer and having to get private medical insurance? I don\u2019t even know where to start if I\u2019m honest and I don\u2019t even know if it will be possible to get affordable insurance while I go through treatment. Any advice would be welcomed xx",
