    "Content": "hallo I am new to this group & chat rooms in general...next week I am having a skin sparing mastectomy & an implant reconstruction right away. not having any of the more fancy reconstructs as i'm anxious about healing time. what i'm trying to find out is how long will it realistically be until i can go back to a sedentary job & resume a normal life generally. I realise everyone is different. I am not having chemo as my cancer is only a recurrence of an In Situ ductal carcinoma. i am 62 & apart from having arthritis pretty fit & healthy. I would be v-grateful for responses Racoleon",
