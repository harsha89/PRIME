    "Content": "Hi  I finished my radiotherapy at the end of last week and although it wasn't particularly bad I have been struggling on and off with my emotions.  One minute I feel fine and can tackle anything, the next I'm in floods of tears and just want to hide away.  Hope it helps to know you are not alone.  I am a very positive person and do everything I can to help myself, but this emotional feeling is playing havoc with me and I am finding it, at times, very debilitating.  The radiotherapy also seems to have aggravated the surgery I had to my lymph nodes and I feel I have taken a couple of steps back with the healing process.  I suppose it's early days still - we'll get there in the end.  Keep smiling :)",
