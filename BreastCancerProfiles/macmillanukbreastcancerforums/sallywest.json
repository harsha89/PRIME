    "Content": "Hi all,      I was advised early on after my mastectomy and axillary lymph node clearance to wear a sleeve as protection when I drive long distances and dig on my allotment. I'v also used it when moving a lot of stuff to and from the car. I 've always felt it helped when I've used it and plan to do so more regularly. I also go to the gym and swim. I started slowly and built up a bit and after 2 months off as I was unwell, I am shocked at how much I am back to being able to do very little without feeling exhausted so ... I'm starting slowly and building up from there.     Can I ask, do you wear your sleeve when at the gym? Best wishes everyone, I'm just getting to the point of knowing there IS life after breast cancer. xxx",
