    "Content": "Hi Tessa, Had the same question myself when I started. I then found out through a nurse that some people did drive themselves. As is always the case - it will depend on how your body handles the chemo. Having handled my first chemo well, I drove myself to the second but I did make arrangement that I could be collected if I was not up to driving at the end of it. With the waters tested - I have been quite confident and comfortable with taking myself to and from chemo for a number of months now. Hope all goes well with you. Cheers Rob",
