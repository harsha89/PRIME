Memory loss.etc are very common.may find yourself pouring your hot water into the sugar bowl instead of coffee cup and silly things like that but that's what a lot call chemo brain.as I did things like that during senior moments I don't worry bout it to much.lol.I feel not only does fatigue affect the body it also goes for the grey matter. Sure others will tell you some off there experiences. Best wishes Tony",
