      "Content": "Hi, My problem is that I am a big girl on the one side and have had a mastectomy on the other!  All the companies do great bras for smaller or average sized women but I am a F cup and find it impossible to get reasonably priced nice looking bras.  I have been to Amoena - try searching for it in Google - they're brilliant for those built in vest tops - I've got two and they were great.  M&S do fantastic bras for all sizes - comfy and nothing spectacular but the range of sizes is good. Heard good stuff about Nicola Jane though not shopped there myself. I was tempted to try and set up a mastectomy bra company for larger women but I wondered if us larger sized ladies are more likely to get recons due to the complete lack of symmetry - I'm 32 now and feel so lopsided! My hospital had loads of leaflets on different companies which I got when getting measured for a silicone prosthesis - might be worth asking there. Vicky x",

Also you may get fluid build up in the area - this is common and they'll drain it off if you need to - doesnt hurt, as the area is numb. The doctors will talk you through everything and the nurses are a blessing - mine were so supportive. Good luck and keep positive, we're all in this together. Vicky",

To be honest though my affected side has not been at all, in the slightest bit, smelly!  So much so that I wondered if the sweat glands are affected when they fiddle with your lymph glands, but then maybe in the summer I would have noticed more.

I'm at the QE in Birmingham by the way. Thanks Vicky x",

I actually found it helped me to work through as much as possible.  I made the decision pretty much immediately to carry on as normal as much as I could.  I spoke to my boss and we acknowledged that everything was an unknown, I could not tell her how long I'd be off after surgery, during chemo etc, but agreed I would keep her informed and be honest and only work what I could do.  I managed to work through the chemo, with a couple of days off when I felt really rough.  I had an eye infection half way through or so which meant a few days off. For me personally I found being honest with my employers helped and I liked keeping to a good routine. It is really individual though - my chemo side effects were manageable enough to go to work.  Some people get harder hit so see how it goes.  ooh and I have an office desk job so not much running around required! Good luck with it and let us know how you get on. Vicky x",

I found the side effects not too terrible - but having said that I spoke to someone who was sick through it!  Everyone is different.  I'd suggest taking the anti sickness and steroids as the nurses tell you.  The epi is the worst of the two regimes.  I got offered a Groshong (Hickman) line as it can be nasty on your veins, that's a blessing as no more stabbing with needles!!  My side effects mainly consisted of indigestion/acidy reflux feeling.  They did prescribe something but that tended to bring on constipation so I didn't bother with it.  Tiredness creeps up on you as time goes on but most chemo patients will probably say that.  Hair comes out just before the second cycle - my friend went for the cold cap and it seemed to work quite well though she has noticed some strands underneath the main bulk fell out, and the body hair still goes (hurrah!) I'm 31 now, so have no idea if chemo is easier to cope with if you are younger,  I'm now coming towards the end of my year of Herceptin so if you want to ask anything about chemo, I'd be happy to try and answer, and there are loads of people on here with stories to tell!

Big feelings at the start were why me, why now?  I'd got married about 6 months before.  My husband is fantastic, a real pillar of support - everyone going through this needs someone as their rock to lean on, definitely. I am nearing the end of my Herceptin and then it's the several years of tablets.  I am hopefully undertaking some training with Macmillan and on the user group at my hospital - I really want to give something back and create positivity out of this experience.  I'm also setting up a support group for people our age in south Birmingham - if anyone is from the area and would be interested let me know. The worst thing now is anxiety and stress over every little niggle - for instance this morning I found a 'ridge' on my remaining boob at the side - we're fairly sure it's part of the bone structure but after what I've had I know to get it checked - great, extra stress!!  I also have a lazy eye but my doc's sending me for an mri just to be on the safe side.  Great.  Lucky me. Anyway enough rambling, just thought I'd shout up as a fellow 30yo! Vicky x",

It was supposed to be 10 days for results from the nodes op, but I asked the nurse when she was checking my drain after a couple of days - she told me there and then!  Waiting for results is horrible, the worst, but I carried on going to work, carrying on as normal as much as I could. Oh yeah the reactions when you tell people can be awful.  I think I've got really matter of fact now and people don't seem to act so surprised-maybe telling people during the chemo phase when they could see more obviously what I was going through, it shocked them a bit!  I just look like I've got a short haircut now so don't get the same reactions!  I have had more body issues what with the lack of hair, missing boob, putting on weight due to lack of exercise...but I'm starting to deal with that a bit better, and yes having a supportive chap is brilliant!

Please don't let fear stand in the way - I was terrified before my mastectomy because of the operation, not knowing what the cancer was doing - the treatment afterwards is all for your benefit, to try its hardest not to let the cancer come back again.",

I have now had the scar for almost a year and it settles down into a line - maybe a slight puckering in places, but no pain, and you get used to the look of it.  I assume reconstruction may be an option later on - I'm planning that next year.  It's still a little numb in places but they give you exercises to do with your arm on that side to keep it moving.  To be honest though, if you do your normal activities and are just careful with heavy shopping bags (good excuse to get a friend/relative to carry your bags!) you'll be ok. There are risks as with any op and they'll explain these to you.  I was happy that if any infection or problems set in they knew what to do, but I was ok in that respect. You really don't want cells that could very easily turn into something horrible, - please do have the mastectomy if that is what your docs advise.  It's for your health and to improve your prognosis at the end of the day.  Compared to those scary thoughts a mastectomy is easy - and we'll be here to offer advice afterwards :-) Vicky x",

I had a mastectomy and then a further op on lymph nodes.  Both times I was in overnight as my surgeon put a drain in and they wanted to check everything was ok.  I was told if I hadn't had the drain I could have been out the same day, but it depends on your hospital and what their policies are, as well as your general state of health.  They said usually a mastectomy is fairly straightforward - in fact they called it a 'minor op'!! (didn't feel minor to me of course!).  Ask the surgeon about what the recovery is like, if you're nervous talk about the anaesthetic, but he'll probably mention what you need to know. I went for a consultation on the recon recently and the nurse said it's not many weeks till they do it following treatment.  I think it was 6 weeks or so usually for recovery.  If you have radio they don't like to put an implant in as your tissue has been affected by the radiotherapy, so they'll do either a lat dorsi from my back or a tummy tuck (the 'Rolls Royce' of recons!!) depending how much tummy flab I've got (lots!).

      "Content": "I tend to agree with Tess and Smelly Cat Lady here - as far as I am aware, cancer is not spread through methods such as massage.  Not being clinical I won't say that is the case for all cancers, but it certainly doesn't sound right!  What I would say though is that they may not want to massage your affected side as the lymphatic system will have been affected by your surgery.  When I joined a women-only gym they advised me strongly not to use their 'VibroGym' which uses vibrations to tone you up - as this could potentially affect my operated side and possibly escalate the onset of lymphoedema.  It might not definitely cause it, but it's not worth taking the risk.  My workshops I went to recently backed this advice up - no strong massaging on the operated side. - which includes the arm, and the side of the body.  The lymph system cannot process fluids and bad stuff as well as it used to, and this sort of treatment might give it too much work to do, leading to build up of the fluids...thus swelling and pain, and potentially lymphoedema. Any clinical people want to explain that one better, or does it sort of make sense? Reflexology and anything else seems to be great though!! x",

Support group - Sez, I'll send you a message about that.  Basically it looks like we'll be meeting in Harborne every month on a Wednesday late afternoon, to start with anyway.  We're still a bit of a trek from you, but if there are any free weekends when you can get to Birmingham let me know and I'll see if I can pull a few people together xx",

Thanks again, I will certainly keep you informed. Vicky",

Funnily enough mine didn't completely fall out, I always had a tiny tiny tiny amount on my head.  Bit like my husband who has mostly lost his hair.  He quite enjoyed me having less than him for a bit!!

The advice about side effects etc are brilliant, keep them coming! I felt compelled to reply as I too am very interested in the nutrition side of things.  Let me know if there are any other forum discussions on here which focus on this, but I feel I should be eating immune system and blood-boosting stuff (had Saag Aloo and something else spinachy at the weekend - does that count?) but don't really know where to start or where best to go for advice.

Thanks for the advice everyone, I am starting to make a little mental list of what to collect together to help the symptoms when my chemo starts! Looks from yesterday's appt like I'll be on tamoxifen after all the treatment as well, for five years, so will be looking into that in a few months, see what the side effects are. Vicky",

The eye thing was first picked up in July 2010 which means I am thinking the right breast was there around the same time but never showed up on mammagram, or as a palpable lump.  All feels very bizarre but am clinging to the positives.  I am interested to hear about other people with similar experiences - bilateral seems to be more common than the docs care to admit.  Mine muttered today about people getting twitchy and opening up a new can of worms!!

Fitting it was interesting - involved a trip to theatres, but they dose you with local anaesthetic and sedative if you want it (I didn't bother).  Lots of pushing sensations but not painful as such.
