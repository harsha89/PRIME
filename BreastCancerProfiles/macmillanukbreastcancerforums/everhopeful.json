    "Content": "Hi     I have been going to yoga sessions at  our local cancer support centre for some weeks now,  its seated yoga, designed for people with chronic illnesses .Our  teacher is wonderful full of encouragement and she makes us all have a good laugh. The only problem is that it has becoming so popular that we are running out of  room and you are in danger of slapping the person next to you in the face when stretching lol . I would recommend this yoga to anyone. Ann",
