      "Content": "I have tried four mfr of Letrozole and go from normal to wheelchair and confused quickly.  Only name brand Femara (mine says mfr in Switzerland) allows side effects to be manageable.  Obviouly I'm not going to take a drug where pain so bad I go from functional to wheelchair just because generic vs name brand.  Getting name brand is nearly impossible in USA for less than $700/month if at all.  But if I have to chose generic or nothing, I'll pick nothing.  It is not anyone's imagination that generic's have issues.  For a year each quarter of a year for past year my husband provided the pill to be blind test, after a few days to a week it becomes clear when he is giving me the generic.  I which medicare formularies offered at least one part D drug plan with Femara name brand.  Would be a lot cheaper than footing a $97,000 chemo eery 21 days.",
