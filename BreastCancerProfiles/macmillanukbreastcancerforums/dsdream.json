    "Content": "Hi , I had my last radiotherapy last Friday and found it fine until the end when the skin became itchy. The radiotherapy nurses are brilliant and will keep you right about what products to use and when. I used aqueos cream you can get a large 500g tub really cheaply or get a prescription and it can be used in the shower as a wash and directly onto the skin as a moisturiser. I had 15 sessions and 4 boost treatments and was a bit tired towards the end . Day 1 is scary because of the unknown but you feel nothing when it is being done and over time it builds up and your skin becomes pink like mild sunburn. I hope your first session has gone wellÂ  Good luck with everything.",
