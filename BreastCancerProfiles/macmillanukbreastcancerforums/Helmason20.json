      "Content": "Hi Chrissie, Crikey...you and I have been down a very similar road....I too  am 35, was diagnosed end of August, underwent Chemo and had my lumpectomy and lymph removal and reconstruction last week...due to start radiotherapy soon and start on the tamoxifen too. Like you somehow I have managed to stay really strong all the way through chemo and leading up to my surgery and now suddenly my emotions are all over the place. I have had amazing support through friends and family, and they all keep saying how amazingly strong i am...but you know what...i dont bloody well feel it and right now my emotions are shot to shit and all i want to do is cry! I hate not being able to do things for myself, I hate having to rely on other people (currently not allowed to drive or anything and live kind of in the middle of nowhere!)The hot flushes I got as a side effect of chemo are still with me and a killer.... and i have heard that one of the side effects of the tamoxifen is hot flushes too....like you at times i feel that i will not be the person I was before I was diagnosed, but then I realise that yes I will.....yes part of me has changed, and I will always have that worry of will it come back, but i am still me... i still have a lot to offer and the strength I have shown fighting this horrible disease has been an inspiration to many around me (apparently) so I have that to be proud of....and I am determined to turn a mega negative experience in my life into a positive one....somehow......yes we have a fair way to go yet, but from what i have heard radiotherapy is a doddle after the chemo and it is, like you say, near to the end.....and we have age on our side, and no its not fair that it happened to us...but it has and we are just going to be even stronger, better more amazing people than we were before, no-one will love us any less, but a lot will love us all the more...and we should be thankful that we have a chance to carry on, so many dont get that (my mum was one of them, not breast cancer, but a brain tumour). keep your chin up....you are only human...you are allowed to feel like utter crap....and dont be scared to admit it...I was...but am not any more....I am here if you ever want to chat or just let off steam... take care of yourself and huge hugs...we can get through this...and we will be even better people when we come out the other side...of that I am certain.

      "Content": "Hi Lynne, My hair began to fall out two weeks after my first dose of FEC  (I didnt opt for the cold cap) and within a few days i had hardly any left.....it was a shock as I thought it wouldnt happen so quick...was told 3-4 wks if not longer!  I didnt get burning sensations at the back of my head, but that could well be due to your hair loss, I would speak to your BCN if you are worried about that. It is very hard to deal with, losing your hair that suddenly, my heart goes out to you, but I promise you it will grow back! I am now a month after my last dose of chemo (had 3 FEC and 3 Docetaxel) and have a very fuzzy head already....it does have its benefits too....trust me....getting ready to go out is a doddle...no hair to wash, dry and style....saves you a fortune on shampoo and shaving gel etc (yup it really will come out EVERYWHERE!).....so there are a few positives to come out of such a horrid side effect. My advice would be to get yourself some lush wooly hats (best thing is this time of year everyone is wearing them!), some super cool bandanas....I have a great collection of them now...all got online from various websites i googled.....one for every sort of mood! And then if you want a Wig...i got one coz my sister insisted I might want it...and she was right, now I am out the other side and actually feeling like going out with my mates a bit, its nice to be able to put on a full head of hair to hit the town with...and no one would know it wasnt my own hair...even my friends are fooled! Chin up....its a tough time, but you will get through it...and remember that you are NEVER alone....on this site we are all here, going through a similar thing and understanding exactly how you feel hugs Helen xx",

      "Content": "Hey Monet, Totally get you there....I havent taken my wig anywhere near the yard!! I did used to wear the ready tied bandanas...google searched them - bandana world was one online shop i got them from, but there are loads out there (and loads of designs!).  They are really good, but hellish to ride in! Made my head sweat loads (didnt actually realise how much our heads sweat and how good our hair is at absorbing it till I lost all mine!) and one day when i took my hat off when it was cold my head and bandana were literally steaming!!! So now up the yard i just wear a woolly hat and remove it when i want to ride, it does the job and to be honest when its as cold as it has been some mornings I am very grateful for it! The bandanas are still in use, and very comfortable, but used when I can't be bothered to wear my wig elsewhere (which to be honest is more often than not at the moment, but am sure that will change now I have finished my chemo and hopefully will feel more sociable!) If you have any other questions or want more horsey headgear advice or just fancy a nice horsey chat would be great to keep in touch. Good luck!  Helen x",

      "Content": "Hi Emnoo, My heart goes out to you.  I know exactly how you are feeling.  I am the same age as you, although not lucky enough to have a supportive husband or lovely child to keep me going. However I do have amazing family and friends around me supporting me all the way. I was diagnosed at the end of August, a couple of months before my 35th birthday.  To say it was a shock is an understatement...and to be honest, it still hasnt actually sunk in properly that I really do have cancer.  Due to the size of my tumour they elected to give me chemotherapy first - i have my last session this Friday (and boy will I party!), but I have been lucky, yes I have had side effects, but in comparison to a lot of people on here (and according to my doctors too) have coped really well and been able to lead a relatively normal life...yes I feel very tired, and I have had to accept that I cant do everything i used to (not easy for me as I hate not being able to do things) but I have adjusted and am coping!   I am due to have surgery in about 4 weeks time, but as yet do not know what i will be facing! It scares me yes, but I have total faith that i will get through this and come out the other side, an even stronger woman and I will beat this.  I have to face 5 years of hormone therapy too, but if it keeps the cancer away I will do pretty much anything!  It is only natural to have the negative thoughts in the back of your mind, I lost my mum to cancer when i was only 21, I lost both my paternal grandparents and one of my aunts to cancer too....in fact until I came on here i only knew one person that had been diagnosed with cancer and survived...so when I was diagnosed my whole world came to a stop...but being on here, and reading other people's experiences and feelings and talking to people has really helped.  Coz you can only understand what it feels like if you have been or are going through it.  You cannot expect friends and family to completely understand things...however hard they try, and to be honest i wouldnt want them to try to hard... Dont try to get rid of those thoughts, but dont dwell on them...i am not, I am aware of them, but I am being positive and believe I will beat this, yes I will admit I have now written my will and made provisions for my horse (my baby!) and kittens should the worst happen, but in doing that I actually made myself more determined that it wouldnt and helped me keep the mega negative thoughts at bay. Use this site, even if just to read how other people are feeling/coping, it will make you realise you are not alone and that others are going through exactly the same. Please feel free to send me a private message, I would be more than happy to keep in touch and be your outlet and your sounding board to help you through this....its going to be a tough ride, there is no doubting that, but you will get through it and come out the other end smiling...I am convinced of that... Take Care helen x",
