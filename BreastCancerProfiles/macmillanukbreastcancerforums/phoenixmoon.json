    "Content": "My mother who is 70 in May who recently had a course of radiotherapy followed by chemo had to have new lenses early last year as she had trouble focussing when driving, she found a few months later couldn't focus again.  Had another test which resulted in buying new lenses.  She is now have more problems again, but is loathe to pay out yet again for lenses. Is she able to get free glasses/lenses with any opticians?  Or at least a discount.   TIA",
