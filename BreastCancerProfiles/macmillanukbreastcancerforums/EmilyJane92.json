      "Content": "Hi, I was diagnosed with Colon cancer 2 weeks ago, I am 25 and still can\u2019t believe it! I have been told the cancer is too low down in my bowel to have it removed so they want me to have chemoradiotherapy for 5 weeks and then they will operate and remove it.  I have been reading about the treatment and know it can cause infertility and menopause which is really depressing as all I\u2019ve ever wanted is a family and I do not have any children yet, I\u2019m going to have IVF but I\u2019m worried that the menopause will mean I cannot carry a baby anyway! Just wondering if anyone knows of any other treatments we could try first or of any successful pregnancies after similar treatment. Thanks ",
