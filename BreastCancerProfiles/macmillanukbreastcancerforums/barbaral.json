      "Content": "That's a tough question. Unless you plan on shaving your head for the next ten years, it could be said that a photo of you without hair would be more misleading than one of you in a wig. I suspect the better answer is the wig - I'm not sure you'd be allowed to wear a headscarf or similar. Most women don't keep their hair exactly the same for 10 years so a few minutes in the booth with a wig on is probably the simplest answer. But here are the contact details for the passport office helpline and I'm sure you're not the first person to have to ask such a question. ",

Once you've tried one of these you'll be dead jealous that we girls don't get to pee standing up.

I've not been in that situation but I had a bit of a blockage and bought some hair clog removal tools on Amazon.  You get a five-pack for £5.59.  Simply thread it down the plug hole and pull. I got a lump the size of a large mouse out of mine. You may want to give the job to a loved one as I can imagine it would be pretty upsetting to see the evidence in that way but it will unclog your pipes. ",

      "Content": "Maybe it sounds strange but in contrast to BtheS, I REALLY like the Movember campaign where men grow moustaches and then shave them off to raise awareness and money for testicular and prostate cancer.  Many men look funny with a tash - many who've had them for years look funny without them. The growing takes weeks and keeps the awareness high and I think it's a fun campaign. Shaving your head though? Not so funny. I think many of us who've had non-chemo cancers - or cancers where the chemo doesn't cause hair loss - get a bit tired of people asking \"So will you lose your hair then?\" when we're diagnosed. People can lose so much in so many ways and this focus on hair is not always helpful. I also feel rather sad for people with alopoecia who are constantly being asked if they are sick because of the equation in people's minds - hair loss equals cancer. Two British women athletes in the Olympics (Jo Rowsell and one of the rugby 7s ladies) both brought that thought to my mind. ",

I think the best we can do is to just hope it all blows over and they get bored with it soon.",

If people were shaving off their hair to make wigs for people who've lost their own hair, I might feel more positively about it. I am reminded of the 'Ice Bucket Challenge' for Motor Neurone Disease a few years back which just left me feeling that it raised a lot of money but very little awareness. I guess if they'd made the MND challenge one to 'sit in a chair all day, don't move and don't speak' the videos on Facebook wouldn't have been very interesting but people might have stopped to think about what it would be like to have the illness.",

I had some contact with the author after she saw a review I wrote about the book a few years back. She told me that a lot of people got quite 'nasty' with her because she has a husband with a good business and could afford an au pair to help out, and some readers seemed to resent that. BUT if you want a down to earth and really rather positive personal experience, I can recommend this one.",

Who knows more about how you're feeling and coping - you or these silly people, most of whom have probably garnered their knowledge of cancer from too many over-blown articles in the Daily Wail or from whispered overheard discussions about somebody's sister's hairdresser's friend who was diagnosed one day and dead the next of some totally unrelated - and quite possibly fictitious - eyelash cancer? They mean well - maybe - but they're also feeding off the vicarious thrill of other people's illness and you're letting them down by not having a good moan and telling them your only remaining wish is to base-jump off the Trump Tower in your underwear. You are not the one who is not facing reality. You're just not performing to their unrealistic and pessimistic ill-informed expectations.
