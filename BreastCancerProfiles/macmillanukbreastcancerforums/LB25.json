      "Content": "Hi I have recently been diagnosed with DCIS, I have been scheduled for surgery on the 26th Feb, I have implants in my breasts at the moment and yesterday at my \u2018Plan Of Action\u2019 I was told a Lumpectomy & a sentinel biopsy followed by Radiotherapy was the route to go, when I asked what was the contraindications to my implant, he said good question! It will contract and go hard and be uncomfortable, we could look at possible reconstruction later down the track, which is fine. He then came back and said I should consider a mastectomy as the cancer is in an awkward place and he would feel more comfortable in removing all as his not sure on obtaining all the correct margins! My question is can anybody relate to this? I am 47 and if I have a mastectomy how do they reconstruct if everything is taken? I would not even have the excess skin for an implant. Obviously I want the best option to be cancer free but I also want to know I have the best option later down the path for both breasts to be similar. Many Thanks LB x ",
