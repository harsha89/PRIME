    "Content": "Hi Ponymad, Its a huge shock isnt it? I was diagnosed this time last year, and it certainly took me some time to get my head around it all. Try and write down questions for your BCN as they appear in your mind, and write down the answers too. I found I missed out on so much stuff because I seemed to be selectively deaf half the time. I also took someone with me to all my appointments, so that they could keep notes, and remind me about questions I wanted to ask. Glad you decided to join us, you will find lots of support here, they are a great crowd. {{{ hugs }}} ZoÃ«",
