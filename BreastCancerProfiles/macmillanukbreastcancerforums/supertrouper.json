    "Content": "I had 4 x EC and 4 x Tax.  I wore the cold cap for the first EC and within 17 days my hair started to come out.  I ended up shaving my head after EC #2 and started wearing my wig from getting up to going to bed.  After two days I got used to wearing it and seeing myself in the mirror.  Eyelashes and eyebrows held on until I started on the Tax.  I went on a Look Good Feel Better course at Christies Manchester and learnt how to fake what I was missing. I always try and find the flip side to anything bad and for me it was the time saved in getting ready, there were no more bad hair days, I saved a fortune in hair products and didn't need to shave anywhere.  The worst of it was that when my eyelashes went, my eyes watered constantly, and when the fine hairs inside my nostrils went - my nose ran a lot! Having said all that, my hair started to come back whilst on Tax - not proper hair, more like baby hair.  I had my last chemo at the end of November.  On January 1st I shaved my head for the last time.  I now have about an inch of hair.  I was blonde and curly before - this is dark and straight.  Interesting!",
