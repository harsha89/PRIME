    "Content": "Hi, This is the issue my wife (and I guess me as well) are currently faced with. She had a mastectomy due to 3 lumps, 2 grade 1 and 1 grade 2. We had been told during the original examinations that the scans indicated that the lymph nodes were clear, but study after the op showed that the first lymph node was affected. They are saying that radiotherapy and hormone treatment is necessary, but that chemo is a choice. She does not want chemo due to the side effects, and I guess one has to way up the risks. I just want her to be well and will support whatever decision she makes, scary though. Steve",
