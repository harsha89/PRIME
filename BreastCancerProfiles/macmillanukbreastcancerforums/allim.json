      "Content": "I have finished my chemo (fec-t ) and am left with a very sore veins on my good arm, also they are tightening up. Sometimes I get a dull ache down my arm and pins and needles. I receive herceptin every 3 weeks onto number 9 of 18 sessions, I now ask them to infuse it in the inside of my arm instead of my hand. Has anyone had these problems ?",
