      "Content": "Hi guys and gals, So it's one week since my mum told me she had been diagnosed with breast cancer. I'm not going to lie, I felt our world had been torn apart. A week later, even though time feels like it has stood still, it also feels like it's passing really quickly.My mum is due for her WLE and sentinol node biopsy on 13th July. This feels like forever away! Although the prognosis for my mum's cancer is good it does not make this any easier. As some of you know I am supporting my mum and family on here on their behalf. My mum is really positive and just carrying on as normal. She knows I am just at the end of the phone or a drive away if she needs me at anytime. My dad is a very practical and positive person, however even if he doesn't show it, it's obviously is a difficult time . Again he knows I am just a phone call away. My sister has taken the news really hard and is still in denial. I have advised her to come on here as it has helped no end but she won't. Hopefully she will work through this! I just wanted to say a quick thank you to everyone who has advised and comforted. I really does mean the world and is making this difficult time a thousand times. All of you guys are incredible and from the bottom of my heart thankyou! Keep fighting the fight! Lots of love to you all, Emily Xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",

It really isn't helpful. That's awesome that you will be back in time for your Mum's surgery! Lots of love to you both! Xxxxxxxxxxxxx",
