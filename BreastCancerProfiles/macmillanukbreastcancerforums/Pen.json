      "Content": "Hi Thanks for the added ideas as to what it might be. If I hadn't had cancer and someone told me that I had a problem with my lymph node etc, I wouldn't be smiling! But I obviously judge other physical problems against having cancer.  Thanks for the email advice, a very good idea. Penny x      ",

      "Content": "Hi I had a lumpectomy Oct 2014 followed by radiotherapy, ovaries removed and am on Tamoxifen. I finished the radiotherapy in Jan of this year.  Ive had a sharp pain under my breast since about April, I thought I might be due to wearing a bra but it has recently radiated all the way down my ribs, it's quite painful, especially when touched, as a result I'm not wearing a bra. I've phoned the Open Access at the Marsden and am waiting for a call back. Has anyone had experience of this? I've googled it and Costochondritis comes up, is anyone familiar with this after breast surgery and radiotherapy? Thanks Pen  ",

      "Content": "Hi Thanks for the replies, sorry to hear that you both have knock on effects from your treatments. Well, the Marsden Open Access, twice I spoke to someone who said I'd get a call back, no call back, on the third phone call to them I managed to speak to a nurse who suggested it could be nerve re growth causing the pain and have given me an appointment to see someone next Friday. I've examined myself more thoroughly and it's strange, there's a thin, raised, straight line of something going down from under my breast, sitting on top of my rib cage, when touched it's very painful, my arm also has a dull ache down to my hand. I'm optimistic that it's the side effects of my op and treatment. I'll write back here when I have a conclusion. Thanks again, Penny.  ",
