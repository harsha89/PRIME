      "Content": "Thank you both so much - it helps so much just to know other people feel the same and that I'm not alone. It's only when I started this discussion earlier that I realised how much I've been bottling things up and it really has helped to get things off my chest. Adele - would be great to keep in touch, I found herceptin to be ok especially after going through chemo and really hope you find it alright too Thank you again - you have both really helped Chrissie xx",

      "Content": "Hi I am 35 and was diagnosed with breast cancer in August 2011. I have undergone chemo followed by surgery in mid Jan and am shortly due to start radiotherapy. I am also having herceptin and have just started taking tamoxifen. Whilst there have been tough times to get through I have managed to stay strong as I have great support from my family and friends. However since surgery (I had a lumpectompy and lymph removal) I have just been finding it so hard - I just want to cry all the time and the continuing side effects, especially the hot flushes, are really getting to me. I don't feel I can explain how I feel to my family and friends and just feel so alone - I want to be positive as I know I'm so close to the end of treatment but just can't be. I feel like I'm never going to be the person I was before I was diagnosed and that makes me feel so sad. Is it normal to feel like this and I guess more importantly will it get better?? Chrissie",

      "Content": "Janice I do know exactly how you feel - I put a brave face on it and am cheerful when around others then shut myself away on my own and just cry, I don't feel I can share this side with anyone as they've been so supportive and I don't want to put on them or let them down by not bring positive and strong. But it does help to know others feel the same and we can all do this together - I now realise how much it helps to be in touch with people who are going through the same thing as I think only someone who's been through it can really understand. I think we can all help each other and I am here if you want someone to talk to or just be able to reveal how you really feel to. Take care and be strong - we will get through this Chrissie xx",
