      "Content": "Thanks Lin I'm def going to dig out my Fitbit and start counting steps...I've tried to move around more the last couple of days and things do seem to be improving slightly. I think you're right, gentle exercise might be the key so I'm currently looking at returning to swimming or looking up yoga classes.  I'm due to start tamoxifen in January and I believe this could add to my aches and pains but shall keep my fingers crossed I don't suffer to bad.  Thanks for coming back to me with words of encouragement.  Angela x",

      "Content": "Hi and happy new year to all.  I finished chemo on 8th december, which I was extremely happy about, however, since then my aches/pains have been getting gradually worse.  I can't say their constant, it's when I try to do something, even walking up the stairs, I find my muscles aching and my back feeling really weak. I can't stand up for long and a long walk is out of the question. My back pain isn't a constant ache, it's more when I stand or walk....can anyone tell me if this is normal....and if so, how long does it last for. I was really looking forward to Christmas but spent most of it on the sofa or in bed.  I'm happy to have finished chemo and wasn't expecting the next year to be easy but hoping these aches are not going to be with me forever...fingers crossed.  A x",
