      "Content": "Hi everybody , I've just joined this site in the hope I may find some hope and inspiration whilst dealing with this condition. I can't seem to find many positive sites about triple negative.. Only doom and gloom!! I've just finished my treatment and now feel like I've been left in a cage of hungry lions with only a feather duster for protection!! There must be something I can do to try and prevent this thing coming back?!!",

      "Content": "Hi Dorothee Lovely to hear from you, another lady with such a positive outlook... Marvellous!! I do feel somewhat shellshocked now treatment has finished.. A time for reflection indeed ! I absolutely believe that by boosting my immune system as much as I can and by generally improving diet and exercise that I can get on top of this? I think the niggle in the back of my mind is that my 6cm tumour didn't respond to chemo.. As someone who is frequently told they are stubborn ( rude!) ... I suppose that's just typical ! Thankyou for your encouraging words and all good luck and wishes to you Sandra x",

      "Content": "Hi Gillie Thank you for your reply.. It's incredible how much better you can feel when you realise you're not alone !! You sound like you've turned the negative into positive which is great :) I have every intention of doing the same.. I'm currently struggling with trying to get rid of fatigue and joint pain; do you take any supplements at all? Also thinking about the return to work .. Have you returned? It's so difficult as I have a very stressful and physically demanding job, this cancer marlarkey makes you wonder just what you really want to do with your life doesn't it ? Very very best of luck with your mammogram üëçüëç Sandra x",
