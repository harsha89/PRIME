    "Content": "Hello Ladies, I was diagnosed in September 2015, and had two surgeries. Clear margins determined after the second one, and no spread into the lymph nodes. I then had radiotherapy, and put onto Anastrozole. I already had osteoarthritis, and while Anastrozole was okay for a while, I wasn't tolerating it well at all after about a year. I went onto Letrozole, which was a bit better, but then got really bad. I read some messages in 2015 about Femera, and got a prescription for it without too much trouble. It does seem to be better, but took about a week to kick in. I have another 2 1/2 years on this, so I'm hoping it stays ok. I also take magnesium, aloe vera and turmeric tablets. Have no idea if they help, but what the heck, I do feel somewhat better now than I have since I began taking all this in '15. I'm determined to stay on the treatment, as I dread what could happen if I come off early. The difficulty is they don't know whether these meds are more effective at the beginning or the end of the five years - can't do a controlled study of that. I've found that swimming helps a lot for the joints, and for my state of mind. So does aqua aerobics. You can get good exercise to the joints while they're being supported. It helps for many hours of the day -  I can't go for more than two days without a swim.  The initial time after swimming is best, and by the evening I'm more stiff and sore, but it's still better than not doing it. I'm trying hard to accept that the discomfort is a really unfortunate part of the treatment, but without the treatment - well, it doesn't bear thinking about....I'd find it hard to forgive myself, and my children certainly would, if I gave up on the meds and then the cancer came back. This is a powerful disease, and it needs powerful treatment. I feel grateful for this site, as I've received good advice (wouldn't have known about Femera without it) and can see, sometimes tragically, what others are going through. This gives me perspective, and camaraderie.  Thank you all for your input - everything helps, including knowing none of us are alone. ",
