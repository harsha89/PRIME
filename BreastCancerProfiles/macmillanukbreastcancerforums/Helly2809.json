    "Content": "Hi Libby I have just finished my first  3 day course of Dexsol after chemo and haven't got on with it at all, upset stomach, blurred vision, continuously restless.    Feel alot better today, first day not using it, so guessing it was the Dexsol causing the problem. Have made a note of the symptoms and going to let my Oncology team know at my next appointment in a couple of weeks. Hope this helps Best Wishes Helen        ",
