      "Content": "Hi, I was hoping to swerve chemo aswell, following my diagnosis. But when it came back after my lumpectomy it was HER2+, (not spread to lymphs) I was told I'd need chemo as herceptin is not licensed to be given without chemo. I was also told it was grade 3.  So I've finished the chemo, hair gone. But it's really not as bad as you'd imagine. And I'd take it all again if it means it won't come back. So, please - one step at a time. You can do this,  Jen  X",

      "Content": "Hi,  I don't really notice any specific side effects from the herceptin alone, although I've had 5 now - I've only had 1 on its own since finishing chemo. Perhaps hips/ legs/ joints a little achy when I wake in the mornings. I am ER- so don't think I'll be taking anything else after her the herceptin finishes. Don't seem to see many Er- ??  Start radiotherapy next week for 20 sessions.  Just reading up on that and the best lotions and potions to help me through it!! Jen x",
