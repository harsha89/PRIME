      "Content": "Hi Patricia, I had the test as mother, aunt and sister all had breast cancer - then me. It was a quick blood test and then about 6week wait. I saw the professor who does this in my area and fortunately it came back negative for the BRCA1 & 2. I wanted to have it done as I have two daughters and my sister has one daughter so if I had been positive there would have been implications for them later in life. I think that if they offer it to you  it's worth doing as it means you will be monitored more closely and it may affect your decisions about mx. If you're negitive then it means you have no more chance than anyone esle  in the population of having a new occurance of bc which is reassuring and if you have any daughters/neices etc then it does give knowledge to them. Good Luck - hope that it goes ok and the number of people with BRCA gene is only a small proportion of those with bc but if you're unforunate to have it then at least you know and can ensure that you get hte best possible monitoring in the future.

      "Content": "Hi,  Saw that you have travelled whilst having chemo. I am going in for operation on 8th Nov but have a holiday booked in France next March - Don't think that I will have finished my Chemo by then. How helpful were the doctors/nurses in allowing you to go away? We're supposed to be going in a big group and I really don't want to cancel...But not sure how flexible the treatment plan will be so was wondering about the attitude of your onocologist. Thanks Susan ",

      "Content": "Dear Suzie, Your post has given me a lift, I've had 3 FEC 100 and am due to move on Tax next week. I'm also having Herceptin so wednesday for Herceptin and thursday for Tax. I had acute sickness the first session but quickly resolved with IV and they upped my anti-sickness so the second and third were fine no nausea/sickness. I ended up with a blood clot on second but have had a port fitted now so last FEC was fine. I've not had any major S/E, not that tired etc but was dreading my Tax next week. We're due to go skiing on the Saturday following Tax on thursday and I was really anxious about the S/E of the Tax as it's the first one. My oncologist is giving me pain killers (a Plan A and a Plan B if plan A doesn't work) but as I've not had any bone pain at all from the injections following the FEC she thinks that I might be OK but I was(am still slightly) really concerned.  Just to hear someone say that they haven't suffered too much from bone pain gives me hope that I'll be ok next week so thanks for posting that. It does boost others. I also had confidence that you and another are having the treatment France and you've been so completementary about the standard, that also made me feel secure about travelling to France. Let's just hope that I don't need to use the hospital. Hope that the 28th goes OK. Susan",

      "Content": "Hi Lynne,  I used the cold cap first time and my hair started falling out about 20 days later - I've got very thick hair and Most people won't know i'm losing it coz I still got lots left. I had a very tender scalp when it started falling out  almost like when you put you hair up for ages then let it down, the hair feels like it's been pulled in the wrong direction. The hair is still falling now but i don't have the same feeling any longer.  Took cold cap off on second treatment as it made me feel sick (couldn't bear having the strap round my chin and I kept on getting hot all over) and decided that I'm curious to see how it will grow back. My kids think it's quite exciting.  Once I'm a friar tuck as i'm definitely losing the top more than the sides I'll be doing my sinead o'connor look and I'm going to treat my self to some fancy earrings.  Susan xx",

      "Content": "Hi Wendy, Similar situation, I had mx on 8/11 but my wound burst due to a seroma 2.5 weeks ago. I have been back to the surgeon 9 times in the last 17 days to have repair stitches and it is still weeping (i have been in bed doing absolutely nothing since friday am and am totally bored. The surgeon is trying to save the implant. I saw the onocologist last week but she won't start chemo until the wound has stopped weeping due to the high chance of infection which could put the chemo back even further. I also don't want any chemo on 10th January week as my eldest has her AS exams and she wants to study medicine so she needs A's !!! I'm hopeful that the wound will seal itself this week and I can start my chemo on either 3rd or more likely 17th January. My was also grade 3 but HER+. My oncologist didn't seem overly concerned that it's not within the 6 week after surgery. Good Luck and concentrate on making sure the wound heals - if you have a seroma don't be polite and wait for an appointment go to the Breast Unit and stay there until you can be drained. I didn't I waited for them to make an appointment and it wasn'tt done quickly enough. Susan        ",

      "Content": "Lucy, I had shoulder length hair, my eldest daughter had waist length, and my youngest had chest length. On 2nd December we all had major hair cuts. I went for a crop, just so that if it does all fall out or thin, it won't be such a shock, my daughters went to chin length. We donated our hair (in bunches of 17.5\", 14\" and 9\") to The Litle Princess Trust, who make wigs for kids who have lost their hair. We also raised nearly £1000 divided between Macmillian and St John Ambulance. It was very emotional, more than I thought it would be but I am so pleased that I did it. I was amazed to raise so much money (use justgiving.com or other smimlar site) and know that out of this diagnosis some real good has come. If you can bear to cut and donate at least the hair can be used and don't worry it will grow back - that's how I coped with seeing my daughter go from lovely long locks to short ones. But now we are all happy with the outcome. I had a mx on 8/11/12 but due to wound not healing properly can't start chemo yet. Good Luck love Susan  ",

      "Content": "Hi Lucy, I'm so pleased that you're thinking of donating some of your hair - it has made me feel better for doing that. Also just to let you know that the E in FEC is the chemo drug that will stimulate hair loss (so my oncologist said) - just to prepare you. Even with the cold cap you would have lost or thinned hair. I'm quite looking forward to having a new haed of hair - apparently it does come back curlier - though after a year it's back to what it was before you lost it (so I'm told). It is a bit scary but Gail Porter lost hers to alopecia and hers hasn't grown back so I think that I'm lucky at least mine will. Good Luck with your journey and keep smiling it's hard at times but a smile does make you feel better. love Susan              ",

I wish you luck next week but remember bc has a fantastic survival rate and all the people here posting are a proof. This site is great as it offers support, reassurance and a place to rant without any judgements. xx",
