Not tired, wiped out heavy shoulders, shattered feeling.........this is 4 months after end of chemo!!!!!!!!!!!! I have had to lie down horizontal for most of day. I got away throughout chemo and surgery fairly lightly as far as symptoms go but boy did I pay on the lack of energy front. I have joined Pilates and did this last wed a week ago and felt knackered ever since. I also started diet, quite strict (1200 cals a day) since last Sat and am really finding it helpful to use MyFitnessPal as it tracks everything and I have lost 4 pounds since last sat. Woo hoo. Off to Florida week Friday so am going to really relax and do some gentle walking and swimming and hope by time I get back that I have bit more energy. Nurse told me 6 months after chemo to get drugs out of system. That will be March....bloody hope so anyway. Sick of feeling like this. Catherine xxx",

The Anaethestic was the stingy bit but after that just bit uncomfortable.. they fitted it and then you get xrayed to see if it's in right postition - took 2 minutes -then they pulled it back about 2cm. None of this was painful. It takes couple of weeks for it to settle down, you can kind of just feel it's there along you collar bone but after a while you don't even notice it. I am so glad I have it compared to needles in hand. they said i had thin veins so it was for the best. It's fine and you dont' feel meds going in. Cx    ",

I can't remember the original size of yours and realise some was swelling BUT that's amazing. Sounds smaller than mine! How dare you!! hehe Seriously though phone the BC nurses and see what they say and I'm sure it's just a reaction to chemo. I have the odd little brown like age spots on my legs and thought what the F are they but just put it down to the drugs. I'm sure as they are so powerful they have to have some outward effects. I'm off to see the surgeon at 11.40am today and not nervous......Now I'm worried I''m not nervous about being nervous!!!!!! but also as someone else said I don't think anyone can really tell what's going on until they have an MRI. Did you get one half way through? Mine is Friday - that's probably why not nervous as they can't tell by just prodding around only about general lump size so don't know what the surgeon thinks he's going to tell me. Hope you get some answers honey. CXX      ",

It's def wiped out and not tired. But Ethel I still can't sleep either and am on Tamezepam which is quite mild but helps to get off. I would be desperate if dr says I can't have them anymore as wake regularly in middle of night and just can't get back off. I sleep so light my poor husband just has to breathe and he's chucked in the spare room! Sorry about the burn Ethel sure it will fade in time. Mine \"iron mark\" is just still slightly red and gets worse if a bit of sun gets on it. Before rads I used Rosehip oil which is meant to be amazing for scar fading. I stopped obv throughout rads but will start slapping it on again now.

      "Content": "Hey Pat This is my area of expertise!! haha since Oct 2010 i have had pouring eyes on and off and dry eyes at night. I get this for several months then it just goes. This started 18 months before chemo. Doestn't matter what weather it is hot cold windy no ryhme or reason. Think it started off through slight eye infection. The two opthalmologists I've seen say it's a symptom of dry eyes as the tear duct over produce to compensate for dryness at night (can't barely move eyeball)s then soon as get up pouring. It makes my eyes look awful and me really tired. I was give moisturising drops to give them extra fluid to hopefully conteract the dryness and stop watering. Also steroid drops worked for me too once but not at moment. Go see the doc. But also noticed side effects from chemo is sore eyes so that's not helping but will go back to dr once this is over. Re keeping eye makeup on you can buy makeup fixing spray. I've got Urban Decay (v expensive) which keeps it on for longer. But you can get cheaper makes. It's been nightmare fro me over last two yrs. Yes people think your updet so have to explain I'm not!! I can't concentrate on anything. When out shopping sometimes I give up and go home! See what dr says Good luck   Cxxx",

I am in Florida at moment on hols, it's beautiful weather but its as much as I can do to drag myself down shops (in car) and physically stand up for an hour! I keep thinking what's wrong with me why am I not slowly feeling better. Even my arms when I overdo it feel like lead and I cannot lift them. BUT. . Around mid dec I cycled five miles round local reservoir and was v tired but not wiped out. Felt i was finally gettin over chemo and feeling back to old self. I could not do that at all at moment so the moral of story I think is that yes rads are a breeze compared to chemo etc but Dont underestimate them either. This has only kicked post week three really. And yes when u are tired it really brings on the dark thoughts. It's horrible. But when slept properly I feel quite positive. If u are physically shattered and wiped out though its hard to keep ur pecker up. And I feel I have to keep telling people how I feel all the time as look fine. It's just time I suppose and we'll get there in end. Sorry I know that's boring but its true. Love and hugs X",

I tried \"insurance with\" a minute ago but cos I'm on drops for my eyes it wouldn't recognise the type of meds so gave up.

Only going for 16 days so won't bother with the one that covers it, seems pointless.

Just having someone around for a chat or to waffle on about their stuff helped me. Be aware that they might just not have the energy to even listen to you though. But some company to keep in touch with life outside your bedroom walls is good. Also having a little radio by here bedside is a good idea as sometimes I couldn't even focus on tv I was so wiped out. Even if it's to nod off to! I did find it very hard giving over completly to someone else re housework (luckily it was my Mum as I'm a bit of a slob!) cooking etc, we all have a certain amount of pride but she will eventually get used to this and realise that you just have to accept help.

At the beginning shooting pains were what alerted me to a problem without there being a lump. 10 days later after prodding around again bam! golf ball sized lump out of nowhere! (40mm) I was reassured it's the lump pressing on nerves which cause this. Apart from this at start I had shooting pains all over and still do sometimes, I was just extreme stress as despite me thinking it was rampaging though my body, it wasn't as had all clear scans everywhere else.

Even had Tramadol on standby. ...........the pain is what scared me more than anything. So I took 1 standard paracetamol and 1 ibroprophen each on the hour. someone here posted that she did it this way so there was no dip in pain relief. I didn take more sometimes but generally it worked. I didn't get bone pain. For me it jsut felt like stabbling pains like apikey electric shocks, don't be alarmed by that either as I felt they were bearable. Didn't need tramadol at all. I know alot of people on here find it awful but for me it was better than Fec as I didn't feel it wiped me out in same way and thank the lord no sickness. So for me............ Nails fine, just a slight yellow line running through, but I blacked them up and put colour over top. Hair starting filling in. No hospital admissions. Slight furry mouth -eat ice lollies, feels great! OK what I hated about it........... Struggled to walk 100yds after for about 8 weeks, I could do it but laid me flat next day. Hated injections to boost blood cells but they were keeping me out of hospital and I'm so thankful I was offered them. There are a few of us on here who didn't find it too bad so take heart and try to relax a bit about it and like everyone says it may be ok for you. I hope it goes well.

I know what you saying re if it look that bad you may as well wear a wig but it's not that bad yet and the thinning has also slowed dramatically. The nurse said if you still have it after round two theres a good chcance of it staying there. I have been chopping bits off myself as layers have all grown out.

What's worry me now - as one of other ladies touched on - is again what to tell son. He is 6.5 so quite aware of what's going on and Mummy's \"Bad Cells\" and has accepted that I have medicine every 3 weeks and am in bed. But when it comes to surgery what do I tell him is happening? I can make sure he doesnt' see me in shower or undressd. He will want to know where I'm going when I go into hospital. How do I explain away drains and all the rest of it? Do any other of you ladies have young kids and how did you deal with it? Cx",

It's growing back and filling in the bald spots I got in front of ears and on top. I got round this by pinning fringe back and it looked ok. Now it's still coming out a bit and I cannot afford to lose any more as it will look too thin. I think it's worth it if you have thick hair in first place. But can honestly say, so much comes out, if your hair is thinnish then I would say it wouldn't be worth it. Yes it does delay treatment alot but for me I would do it again.

      "Content": "Hi Annie So glad you got your appointment sorted. It makes such a difference just having a bit of compassion from someone too even if it is the secretary or someone at end of phone. I hope the surgery comes round soon for your too. I definitely felt better after surgery pychologically knowing it was out and that i may be cancer free. Saying that i have my results on Friday with surgeon and am back to worrying in the middle of night that he hasn't got clear margins. Enjoy the reflexology and let us know how it goes and I might try it. You sound a bit more upbeat today in your posts, distractions like the book and doing something nice that you may not normally do to pamper yourself has got to help. Love Cxx  ",

      "Content": "Hello Ladies, I just thought I would post to all those awaiting Docetaxal/Taxotere treatment. I was absolutley terrified of this and got into such a state. But just wanted to say (and hope I'm not jinxing myself) that for me it's been a better experience than FEC. 3 days after treatment stabbing pains neck down uncomfortable but not unbearable. Started to take Ibruprophen/Paracetamol and Codeine. Was told every 2 hrs but took lower dose after advice on here every hr. Sometimes full dose every 2hrs. this continued for 5 days then started stabbing pains started wearing off. Day 7 just few tabs a day. Day 10 today and just taken a couple of painkillers. I've had lower back ache (just ache) and leg ache a bit throughout all of this too but the painkillers have kept everything for me under control. The codeine made me have tummy aches/constipation and was sick twice, I believe as was very bunged up. Lactulose cleared me out (literally) but felt much better. No sickness apart from that and slept much better due to minimal steroids. The total wipe out I had with FEC has not occured with this. Just tired and cannot do too much. slight furry feel to mouth but no ulcers or anything. On Day 7 of treatment went away to coast for weekend and I don't think I could of done this on FEC. I don't mean to be insensitive to the other ladies that have has real bad reactions but felt another view would help some of the ladies about to have it. As we know wer are all different and react in different ways to this. Get prepared with the painkillers mouth wash etc which helps with the anxiety of something new and unknown. I felt so much better having Tramadol on hand but didnt' need it in the end. Godd luck ladies I hope it's not too bad for you. C xx    ",

My lump had eventually shrunk from 4cm to (after 5th round chemo) 17mm, then final results 12mm after round 6. I got clear margins and they took 3 lymph nodes and they were clear too. My ex army surgeon was welling up he was so hapy for me! Since seen the rads consultant and I have to have 4 weeks worth. She said because of my age (43) I needed extra week boost. (now I'm old. At beginning I was considered young! haha.) Certainly feel like I've aged over the summer. Feel like I've come through this relatively unscathed but am still so tired and can't do much even though I'm over 7 weeks after last chemo but very happy nonetheless and nice to have that bastard lump out!!!

The first one I took tablets for several days every couple of hrs, although didn't need them in night. So this 2nd round of it has been even better than first Tax. So has my body acclimatised to if for want of a better word? Who cares just so pleased it's do able for me and it's shows you we are all different and react in different ways. so try not to worry too much - just get prepared with all the painkillers you may need. My tramadol is still untouched :-)) Just one thing I will say - I can only do say an hrs of cooking going out etc before I need to lie down and rest for half an hr but still it's not the complete wipeout like on FEC.

Saw Rads consultant for follow up and she couldn't feel anything. she was more worried about my state of mind!! Kept saying you should make an appointment to go to maggies centre to talk to someone in Oxford. ( I am a very positive person and got through chemo really well). I was offered a ct scan of body which I am having today. Crappping myself as she will call me with results in next few days. She said they don't offer them out as a follow up not because of cost but because obvioulsly if it's spread then it can't be cured just controlled and some people don't want to know that information.............huh? Surely if there is something there it's better to deal with it early?? Anyway hopefully it's nothing. But I would rather get it checked out just in case. It's true what they say this is the hardest bit after treatment. NOT because I want to be cosseted by appointments and hospital visits....(never want to see the bloody place again!) but it's hard to live with the FEAR! and just get on with it when you have niggling pains all the time. When my ache isn't there I almost forget about all this crap. Consultant doesn't think it will make any difference to my state of mind but it will I'm sure. I don't want to waste my time worrying and just want to get on with life -love it too much and have to many things I want to do.    ",

He wanted to see injection site!  He came up to me in bed this morning with a notepad and pen playing waiters. He said what would you like to eat and I said I can't but will have water and he said ice with that and trotted off to get it for me and charged me £5 for ice and £5 for water!! I wasn't worried about having scan. I have been poked and prodded due to recurrent miscarriage treatment over last 7 months so not that scared of any of this anymore..........it's the results I'm crapping myself about. My onc seems to like phoning me with results when on own. And cos it's the bone...well just scared of spread. should think it'll be Monday now so will try to enjoy weekend and keep busy. Scan was in Nuclear Dept ! and injection was in heavy metal box..god knows what it's done to me! I was left alone in scan room with cold fan blowing in face and no music.

I depends on what day after washing as to how it looks. But there's no life in it and it just kind of hangs! I've been tempted to go the wig route too for a while. I remember when I tried them back at the begginnning of this it looked like I'd just walked out of the salon. people still probably would have noticed as I never look that groomed haha! ER how do I feel?..............17 days after last Tax and I have felt like I have been steam rollered for 3 days. 15 mins is about my limit for being up on my feet. sick of it. Last weekend I was out at local fete and felt fine. I have been worried about this sudden downturn as thinking my bloods may be low?? So just come back from Dr's as chemo unit said have blood test to check so am going to ring them tomorrow for results. I feel like I did on FEC and like I've gone backwards. No temp or anything. Sat night watching tv I was seeing double!! I might have just overdone it. I must say the last Tax barely any pain but wiped me out and I suppose it's just the build up. Cx  ",

It's also growing back at same time round edges so that's a very good thing. I think i will be cutting it a bit shorter soon to try and make it look bit thicker. How are you? Cxx",

      "Content": "Wow don't know how or if I can express what I feel tonight. You ladies are so wise and articulate my words may be inadequate but all I know is tonight I just have tears rolling down my face with relief. Relief chemo is over. I had my last Chemo (3 fec/3tax) last Thursday and I am a week on. I thought the emotions might spill over as I've been quite together for the duration of the chemo. The first time I have spoken with BC nurse was the other day.I didnt' think I needed her, I thought I was tough. Whereas actually it was quite nice to hear her soothing tones over the phone, sympathising with my stupid worries over surgery to come and rads. Saying that it's taken a week to get hold of her. What i'm trying to say is I feel free. Free of drugs. Free of injections (last one last night). Free of picc lines. Free of being wiped out. Free of painkillers. Free of being bound to my bed. I never want to feel vunerable again. Ever. It's felt like being imprisoned since May. I went out on my own this afternoon, no chaperone in case I felt unwell. Just me in my car with music really loud. Do you know how normal I felt? I think only you ladies will understand, I know only you ladies wll understand. All the cliches are true: I will slow down, live for the moment, appreciate what I've got and take time to enjoy it. I will never take my health forgranted again. I will be forever thankful to my Mum and Stepfather whom have done everything I have needed and been there there without question. I will cherish my darling boy who has just taken all this in his stride. I will hold dear my husband and friends who have just kept things normal for me. and thanks to my gorgeous kittycat whom seems to have a sixth sense of when i'm down and has kept me amused through all this. He is now a leggy rascal who has grown up whilst I've been in bed the last few months. I never knew pets could be so comforting and perceptive! This is starting to sound like an Oscars acceptance speech so i'll wrap it up! I know I am not out of the woods yet. I still have to wait for the final results after surgery but I feel the debilitating bit is over and i can only feel physically better day by day from now on. I feel really happy to have got through it and proud of myself and can't wait to restart my life (Someone warn me if this is some kinda post chemo euphoric afterglow!) thanks for reading hope I haven't bored everyone stupid.

I had to wait 13 weeks for result from test which was done at Northampton but sent for analysis at Oxford. All was negative. Once I had test done and was waiting I was very worried and thought what have i done as if it was positive it was have pushed me into the dilemma of whether to remove both breasts (i had lumpectomy in end). So was very anxious awaiting results. But the big positive even though nothing found was that both my sisters now are entitled to yearly mamograms the same as me. So it was worth it jsut for that.

I too have been scared about infection and DS getting ill, but I am over the 10-14 day immunes drop off so hope fully I will be ok this month. Just keep away from anyone else with colds etc ( there isn't alot you can do I spose about kids). I found first 5 days sicky on and off. Take all the recommended anti sick. One of mine was 10 - 20mg and I tried to get away with 10mg and was bordering on throwing up but took it and half hr later was ok again. They work pretty quick. Make sure people realise you need to take regular rest, even if it's just shutting you eyes on sofa for 10 mins. It keeps you going. The actual drip - mine was hadn fed into me for 50 mins was a doodle and didn't feel bad apart from bit sleepy at one point. Felt fine until got home and couple hrs later def needed the tabs. I think mine were spot on for me actually By day 5 after you take one in morinin and you feel a bit lost! But I have some back up ones if I need them. Cold cap is a pain but jsut take paracetamol half hr before you have it. Worst for first 20mins and then it's was v berarble. Oh and then took Ibropropehn into last hr with it as felt bit dizzy with dull head. But no migrains or anything But we have to remember everyones' different. Day 10 after, I have had a few mouth ulcers, tiny ones and got rif of them with salt water wash in mouth. Also tmi - hair down below started last night to come out in clumps in bath !! Don't care about that but thought oh shit are eyebrow and lashes will be going, so inspecting them with magnifying glass!! but the cold cap must be working to certain extent as very few hairs on head lost so far.   Good luck ladies hope is good as my first chemo. x",

Anyway one thing (amongst many others) that I think is contributing to all this is the fact I am sure i am peri menopuasal of menopausal. What are you all doing to alleviate this? Obviously we all have to be aware of oeostrogen in our bodies especially if you are Hormone receptive. I am triple neg (very triple neg) but even Onc said she wasn't happy with me taking Red Clover for flushes as should be avoiding anything including Phyto Estrogens. So I stopped taking them immediatley. My problem isn't flushes though, I can put up with them..... it's whether it's contributing to my Chronic Fatigue which is absolutley debilitating. I felt better on day 5 onwards on Chemo!!!!!!!!!!!! I am having blood test to actually see if going through Menopause so that will be interesting. Anyone have any suggestions?. I would be really greatful. Love to you all xx",

I had 3 x FEC and am having 3 x Tax at moment - now have round 5 Thurs of 6. On first Tax as it's only one drug instead of 3 together she asked if i wanted it removed - I had it out and didn't feel a thing on removal. but it was so worth having it. Hair - as I said 5th round this week and still have hair. I have to clip fringe back so it covers a wide parting but if you didnt' know me you prob wouldn't guess what was wrong with me. I have lost half my hair I reckon and it much much thinner but still worth using cold cap for me. Saying that eyebrows getting bit patchy and eyelashes sparse but with eyemakeup it helps to disguise that. I think someone said they were last to go. Downstairs was first bang on day 14 like they said! But who cares about that bit! Hang on in there it gets better when all the shock wears off and you have a plan. Your mental state is so much worse when you feel physically poorly too but mine picks up alot in my good two weeks and I'm just thankful to be alive and doing normal things.  ",

Stopped Codeine and stuck with others as yes constipation not good but got some Lactulose and that did the trick. So it's day 8 and I have just taken a couple of ibruprophen. I really feel for you as I was terrified of this drug but for me it's turned out better than FEC so far. Hope you get sorted out quick honey.x",

I just feel better about it, especially since having a baby (now 6) I certainly didn't want to put any rubbish on him when he was small. Everything you look at has bloddy Sodium Laurly Sulphate in it!! Even bought cloth nappies and used to love seeing them hanging out on the line. I realise there are so many environmental factors that we can't control but I just feel better avoiding what I can. I have a great book about making you own soaps, creams and whatever. So you can like Tinkers said make your own and you know exactly what's in it - you can get all the stuff on ebay. OK I admit I have never had time haha but i may get that book out today and have another look and if got the energy do something about it. i now my son would love to get his sticky fingers in the mix!!

I almost don't care what type it is as it's all treated in same way and think theres little point in scaring myself even more. What I am more worried about is my bone scan results which she is ringing through possiblty tomorrow! I am terrified I have secondary stuff and can't even go near that board as had quick peek and it's got some horrendous stuff on it. Just try not to feel guilty about kids and get as much support as you can from friends and family. You come first at moment and sod the house, just try to get out for some fresh air with kids or something. I know you won't stop thinking about it but it may make you feel a bit better. Shame your not nearer we could give each other some RL support x",

Just slapping aqueous cream on helps the itching. I must say this is the most anxious I have felt throughout this whole process -chemo surgery rads. I have another problem elsewhere and of course am panicking that it's something related. Well not panicking, virtually hyperventilating in doctors the other day! I get anxious in chest everytime I go to hospital. It comes and goes. It seems like it all par for the course at the end of treatment. Keep slathering up with the cream. xx    ",

Tonight am anxious 2nd chemo tomorrow -don't know why nothing to be scared of I spose. Sorry I digress - yes had soreness/ newish kind of lump higher up on breast which is not there now and I think this is down to the marker coil I had put in I think it's just bruising and swelling. Will check all this as see Onc tomorrow so can eliminate all these worries. As you know had stabbing pains too and took paracetamol which sorted that out. I will pm you in next day or so. I too have a book to read recommended by my good friend who's sister had BC and she was grade 4 and now in remission after 5 yrs clear hooray! She folllowed this book \"your Life in Your hands\" by a British Scientist who had Bc. I'll let you know what it's like. Love Cx    ",

I only have the one boy, who is brilliant and gorgeous and I am so thankful I have him as i know alot of women have to freeze their eggs after DX when they are young and have no children at all. I had five miscarriages before this started in May over 3 yrs and was being treated for it, so I tried really hard to have a sibling for him. I have even thought that if I don't go into full blown menopuse and periods come back to try one more time but I'm 43 so it's all getting a bit late, that's even if I could keep it. I was so close to having another one. But sometimes I believe that we just have to accept what we are given in life and make the best of what we have. It's especially hard when my son cries when he hears of others having babies and why can't he have one. so yes I know how you feel. Cxx      ",

The book I think you got that I am still on is a triumph over these diagnosies 4 ongoing different re-occurances and she is thriving over a decade on! Shows you against all the odds you can beat this bastard C. I too am not interested in prognosis - I just want to get fit and healthy again and make the best of it. whatever that is. I don't think i could bear to know and why waste a single minute. I have also had lots of strange experts with a weird manner. Even my Onc who I think is really good got misinformed by some initial biop results and gave me some misinformation. So they are not all infalliable. But she should have got your info correct before she saw you. I would be inclined to seek another opinion I think. But I know having the strenght and energy to do that must be hard right now. Wish I could come up and give you a big hug honey. You've got your lovely hubby and children - hold onto that. Beat this for them. Catherine xx",

Hey back with you now :-)) Haven't barely had any s/e apart from severe shatteredness (that's my new word!!) Just wondered how long to get over this. Warm baths are a regular fixture for me every night haha. I have been addicted to them all my life! You have done amazingly well to be on form 3 months after chemo. you must feel soo good about that. That's what i miss, feeling fittish. I was never super fit but love my bike and can't wait to go cycling again. Well just to walk round to school really without having to lay down afterwards! I am going to start racking the vitamin intake up too. It's funny how similar to being pregnant this is in some ways. I remember saying that I was sick of feeling fat and tired, ( I now know what tired is) and that I wanted to run through the fields when baby had come. haha That's how I feel now, miss just being able to walk anywhere. But what I really would love to do is run up and down hills screaming I'm alive!!!!!!!!!!!! Ok one step at a time................ I dont know about be friending me, you probably think I'm a complete nutter! thanks again for your reply CXX",

People think I'm doing good and I spose I am but I kind of reserve what energy I have for important things like getting son to school and then collapse on sofa or have a bath which perks me up slightly. I have only been able to get son to school every day for last couple of weeks (2 mins round corner). Up until then about 6 weeks after chemo could only walk about 200yrds without having to lay down for a long time and feeling shattered. I have fared well with the chemo but as a person who needs alot of sleep and gets tired easily I had a sneaky feeling this would affect me alot and it has. Saw onc the other day and she said that I wouldn't feel totally myself for 18months to 2yrs!! The thing is as long as there a bit of improvement that we can see each week that's the main thing. And a diary is a good idea as you do forget that little bit you couldn't do last week. We'll all be different in our recovery times but spose the moral of the story is Patience!.........yawn.      ",
