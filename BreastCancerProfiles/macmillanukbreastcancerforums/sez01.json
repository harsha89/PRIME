      "Content": "Hi, I was diagnosed july last year at 33 years old, i was grade 3 triple neg, i recently went to a breast cancer care young womens forum and it was marvellous, we met with experts from gynaecologists, doctor, healthy eating, menopause, fertility, laughter yoga, i would recommend it to you all, its all free you just need to get yourself there.  And i met some really  fantastic ladies ranging from 30 to 50. I live in stoke and would be interested in joining your group vicki i too found it a bit isolating being younger too and its is hard when folk go oh but your so young and look at you as if you know why big hugs to your all Sarah xx",
