      "Content": "Hi G and J very disappointing meeting. Went armed with loads of questions and he wasn't interested in any of them, just wanted to see if I had burned during the rads.  Still having the counselling as I cant seem to move on. What I really want is a body scan to reassure me that I haven't got cancer anywhere else! Totally irrational really, but that is my problem . I was fine whilst I was having my treatment but found as soon as it stopped then the worrying started! I don't feel like eating so have lost nearly 2 stone since June, don't mind that I look better in skinny jeans, but eating and drinking was a real pleasure for me before all this. I have no right to feel this way really as DCIS is completely curable. My councillor says it is because I didn't find a lump originally and was taken completely by surprise at my regular mammogram appointment. It was like I was going down the road minding my own business and suddenly a car hit me from the side! i will probably feel better once I have my mammogram in May. thsnks for asking me",

      "Content": "Thanks for replying so quickly, you are right - I should try living in the moment rather than worrying about tomorrow! Something my counsellor is always telling me! In fact I was thinking of attending a course in mindfulness in my lunch hour at the local Force cancer charity centre. Funny thing is this morning I feel fine! Got into work, loads of spread sheets etc to do, staff wages, appointments to attend (I run my own design agency with my husband) and loads to do! The bad thoughts come in the evening and when I am tired!! Remedy...keep busy!! I know I will be able to move on in time....just wish it would go quickly! Am thinking that I shall really start planning Christmas soon and really go to town this year! Thanks PS The post surgery pathology said 21mm Grade 3 DCIS",

Can anyone tell me what this will involve? Will he just chat to me? Will he be able to reassure me that everything is alright? Will I have a CT scan to check that anything has spread? Obviously you can all probably tell that these questions are very important to me. I am still having tenderness from the rads and surgery, but most of all I am still very tearful and tired. Am having some great counselling sessions with a local cancer charity which is proving helpful.....but really want to know if I am all clear! Am so worried that the appointment will be just a little chat and he will say that my next visit will be in May for a mammogram!",

Don't be hard on yourself, the whole thing is a massive strain, you say that the scar has healed already, but it is still there and I am sure that it is still a shock in the morning to see it. I know I struggle with that at the moment. Get some lovely treats and try and pamper yourself, you deserve it. Love Caroline",

      "Content": "Hi I have posted a couple of times in the past - just to update: I was diagnosed with high grade DCIS in June and had a WLE in July and a further one in August as the first time there was not a clear margin. I then had 15 radiotherapy treatments. I had no nodes affected and haven't been prescribed with any tablets. As far as I knew I should now be on the road to recovery. However I haven't been feeling very well and since August have lost nearly 1.5 stone in weight ( not feeling like eating,  nausea, tired). I have also been having counselling as I found my diagnosis very upsetting. I went  to my doctors last week and she ordered blood tests, the first ones came back with high levels of calcium so she redid them and just been told that the results are the same. Does anyone know if this could be connected with my DCIS or if I am just unlucky and now have something else to worry about! She has written to the hospital as I will have to have further tests and possibly an operation on a gland in my neck - but before all this I would appreciate a little bit more knowledge please - and you kind ladies have never let me down in the past! Is it related to my DCIS?",

      "Content": "Hi I was due to have my 6 monthly clinical follow up tomorrow following 2 x operations and radiotherapy for DCIS. I have a slight amount of pain over the surgical site, but nothing major. However I was looking forward to the appointment so that I could move on and put this all behind me. I also have a parathyroid tumour, which I am waiting for an appointment to see the surgeon on 4th March (just over a 4 week wait for this appointment!), which is making me feel tired. I am at work and just had a call from the breast follow up clinic that my appointment has to be cancelled as my consultant has just got back from his holiday and there are too many people to see tomorrow. Until I burst into tears on the phone I hadn't quite realised how important this appointment was to me. Obviously the secretary realised I was upset and called me back after about 20 minutes with an appointment on Thursday this week. However I am now feeling very guilty that there should be other people worse off than myself who need to see the consultant and I am just wasting his time.....after all I am well - probably not like some of the other women in the clinic. Guilt and DCIS seem to go hand in hand.....but not sure how I can face him now on Thursday - what will he think of me wasting his time and having to reschedule probably more poorly people than me.",

She was kind to remake it so quickly....initially it was going to be weeks and I don't care to think what state I would have been in by then. Like many others I have felt worse after treatment stopped - and I have read the excellent paper on this - and this was a pivotal meeting for me to try and go forward. I am having counselling and have to address anger and control issues! There are so many things I wish I could say to the medical profession about how this type of cancer is dealt with, but I will never get the opportunity..... I hope I can hold it together for Thursday now as I am sure he will think I am some sort of basket case.",

Considering all the bad news we all hear about the NHS it must be very demoralising for them to work there sometimes, and my thoughts go out to them. I would like to do more to show my support of all the individuals who work there.....they manage to make me feel individual each time....and yet they must speak to hundreds of women with my issues. They have my complete admiration. :D",

He was very kind and spent time going through stuff with me. He also pointed out that I would benefit from a prosthesis so I have made an appointment with a breast care nurse for the end of March. He also said that in 6 months time I could have some reconstructive surgery if I wanted it - I hadn't even thought that this would be available for a WLE. Very happy bunny now....still desperate for my first mammogram in May, but for the moment happy to look forward to Spring. What a difference a few days can make!",

      "Content": "Hi JPL (Sorry not sure of your name!) First of all good luck with your HR meeting, hope you discuss all that you need to. We are indeed twins!! If you read my personal bit on my page I have said everything that you have!!  I too am having counselling with a lovely lady who has now made me realise that, as you, it was cancer and bazarrely I find that easier to come to terms with. I started the new year off with a resolution that I was going to be positive and look forward, plan things in my diary etc, and not sit in my car crying!!  Not gone too well so far! I have been losing weight for a while  and put it down to the radiotherapy, but now have a meeting with a consultant tomorrow following a nuclear scan, to discuss a parathyroid tumour that it revealed. I am sure it will be benign (they nearly always are) but it has brought all the memories of the waiting and consultations etc back. Like you, I have found great strength in my friends and family and also in the local church that I go to. The priest even had a mass for me! How lovely was that! I have joined our local Hospital Chaplaincy visiting team and sit and natter with people in hospital who have no visitors, and have raised a lot of money for my local cancer charity where I have massages and counselling. So, once tomorrow is out of the way and any surgery, I will once again look to being positive. I am 100% sure that I am not going to let this hiccup take over my life......the anger that I have I am turning round to make a difference, at least in my own little world!! I still think DCIS has deeper issues psychologically than is at first recognised, and maybe I will see if I can help with this in the future, meanwhile I am looking forward to Spring, days on the beach (I live in Devon!) and lots of picnics and walking with my lovely family and friends.  I REFUSE TO BECOME A VICTIM - I WANT MY LIFE BACK!!",
