      "Content": "I have to say I agree with Smelly_cat_lady.  We're alive and breathing, and therefore scars and tats shouldn't bother us.  I have two scars on my left side from the masectomy, which I count as my battle wounds. And the 3 tats are barely noticeable.  I am so looking forward to reconstruction as I decided to delay this until after all treatment was done.  I have walked round with no hair as my wig  would itch so much, 'cept for in the snow, a woolly beannie was a neccessity!!! But life is too short and very precious.  After being diagnosed with BC, I think you do tend to look at the world a little differently.  Rads were a walk in the park compared to chemo, and all the staff at my hospital were fantastic.  A little tiring because it takes a good three quarters of an hour to get there, depending on traffic.  But the three weeks soon pass.  Good luck with it all x",
