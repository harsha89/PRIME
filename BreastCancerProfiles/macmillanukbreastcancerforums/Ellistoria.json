    "Content": "Thanks for that post.  That has really made me smile!  Kids are really great at making us take a step back and think about things differently.  I am just at the start of this very long road and haven't started treatment yet, though it will start in the next few weeks.  It's great to know that you are all out there sharing the same experiences and ready to talk to.  Talking to my children I know will be the hardest part of everything I will have to endure but this site will make it easier.",
