I am now on medication for the next 5 years those being anastrazole once a day and a zoladex injection every 3 months however I am now experiencing joint pain in my fingers ankles knees and hips and also swollen fingers I was wondering if anyone else has experienced this and what can be done or anything that can be taken to alleviate these symptoms ",
