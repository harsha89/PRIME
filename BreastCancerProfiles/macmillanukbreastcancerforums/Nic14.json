      "Content": "I have had 2 rounds of FEC100 and used the cold cap. My hair started falling out 3 weeks after the first chemo and it is now very thin on top. I found loads came out when I last washed it, I'm washing it today so I'll see what happens. I like hats so I'll manage wearing them if I don't lose too much more. I've been wearing a silk hat at night and I don't comb my hair unless washing it.It's definitely worth trying the cold cap even if it just delays hair loss - gives you time to come to terms with it. Good luck!",

      "Content": "Hi, I too lost a bit of confidence in my local hospital ( Chesterfield) due to a slow diagnosis and some pushing on my part for a biopsy, I has the surgery doe there as I didn't want further delays but now I am at Weston Park which is a specialist cancer hospital. I feel so much safer with this and the main benefit is I am on a drug trial. If you have your oncology appt at a specialist hospital then you could be offered the latest trials which aren't available at other hospitals. Hope this helps",

      "Content": "Hi, I'm not sure where you live but I think the trial is only offered at Weston Park in Sheffield in the Uk, as well as worldwide. It's a testing a drug called Kadcyla which is Herceptin combined with chemotherapy plus Perjeta. They are all targeted drugs that attack the HER2 sites. It has been used in advanced breast cancer cases with success and is now being trialled on the early cases. So far I've had 3 cycles of FEC, next stage is the trial drug for 18!! cycles,every 3 weeks. I'll be ready for a decent holiday next year... Good luck to everyone with your treatments.",

      "Content": "Hi Yvonne, The Kaitlin trial still involves herceptin so it probably wouldn't be suitable at the moment for you.. I think the chemo affects your heart so it may be that when you've finished that then the herceptin could start.Â I'll have regular heart scans to detect any changes, second scan next week. good luck.",
