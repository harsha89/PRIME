I\u2019ve now been back full time for 3 weeks.  I struggle to be selfish & felt guilty for being off work when I felt ok, but you do have to take time for yourself. Although RT is nowhere near as bad as Chemo it\u2019s can still leave you feeling really tired.  Take some you time :)  Bug Hugs Julie xx",

I had surgery 26th April tumour was removed with clear margins and no lymph nodes infected. Tumour was 2.1cm er positive.  I\u2019m now awaiting to see oncologist for about 3 weeks Radiotherapy and then hormone tablets for 5-10years.  I couldn\u2019t eat or sleep & It\u2019s very natural to worry & the waiting is horrible. Since I got full results and treatment plan I\u2019ve felt so much better! I\u2019ve still got a few rough weeks/months but when my surgeon said at the beginning it\u2019s treatable I can now believe her and feel confident that I can do this, and as time goes on you\u2019ll get to this stage.  I live by myself and know exactly how you feel about imagining all sorts when you\u2019re by yourself.  I coped by reading on here about things and arming myself with as much information as possible. I hope your feel better soon. You can do this ;-)  Bigs hugs  Julie xx",

I started Tamoxifen just under 2 weeks ago and my mood has slowly been dropping to the point I couldn\u2019t stop crying last night. The slightest thing makes me feel tearful.  I realise this is one of the SE but this quick? Or could it be reality has finally hit home for me as I had my Radiotherapy planning appointment on Thursday.  If it\u2019s the Tamoxifen how likely is it to last?  Thanks  Julie xx",

Thought I\u2019d got off lightly, but the past few days been really down.  I\u2019m gonna try taking them at bedtime as I was taking them in the morning so fingers crossed! & hopefully things will settle back down.  I had my Radiotherapy planning on Thursday just gone. Was all pretty straight forward, measurements, tattoo markers and practiced my breathing as mine was left side. I started Rads 9th July so 2 weeks to enjoy the sun before I have to cover up lol  Hope you\u2019re doing well & things go well with your Oncologist meeting next week.  Bigs hugs Julie xx",

I guess they were never proper friends anyway! We live and learn aye lol.  As for the Tamoxifen, feel like I\u2019m on a slight (kiddies) rollercoaster lol. I do feel better but it\u2019s bubbling under the surface. I think when this box runs out I\u2019ll see if I can get 10mg or ask if I can split them. Until then I\u2019ll keep fighting them lol.  Thanks again for everything  Julie xx",
