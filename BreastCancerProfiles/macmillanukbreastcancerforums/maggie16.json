I have read up what I can on it but wonder if there's any first hand experience or advice anyone can give me? Many thanks x",

      "Content": "Hi Wendy. On advice from my oncologist I had a portacth fitted privately as I got severe plebitis after my first chemo. The port was fitted under sedation and sits under the skin on my upper chest. Access is directly through the skin unlike a picc line which sits outside. The advatage is very little risk of infection and no day to day care needed, however I will be left with a small scar about 3 cm long but this will fade in time. Unfortunately we only found out the day before my op that our insurance co were unwilling to pay for it (having been told previously that they would - now subject to an on-going battle via the FSO!!!) and after a complete 'melt down' on my part and much convincing by my husband we went ahead and paid for it  - not cheap - just over £2000 and the prospect of another £1000 to have it removed (unless of course our complaint is upheld?! ) My PCT was unwilling to either fit or remove it on the NHS but others may so it's worth trying. If you do decide to go down the private route it's worth asking for names of surgeons who can do it - the nurse at my cancer unit told me that there is a surgeon in Oxford that could have done it for cheaper than I paid, unfortunately the info was too late for me but it's worth shopping around! Having said all that my portacath has proved a god-send - no fishing around for veins every time. Hope this helps. x",

I don't feel I can give you any real advice, that is best coming from those that have been there but please know that I think of you often and am so glad that you will be going ahead with the op on Monday.  I know this has been a very difficult decision for you but your courage is admirable - don't ever forget that. x",

      "Content": "Hi. As I said yesterday I have not had a mastectomy and therefore may not be in the best position to offer any real advice. However after my diagnosis and surgery in June I was surprised when my oncologist asked if I wanted to proceed with chemotherapy, in hindsight I suppose I was a bit naive and can now see that of course you have to weigh up the options and give consent. He asked if I wanted to go away and think about it, I asked what his clinical advice was and the reply was 'always chemo' for my situation. That was enough for me, I signed the consent there and then. I guess what I am trying to say is that it may help you if you can think of it in terms of 'they know what's best'. I know that's sometimes easier said than done and it is our bodies after all but for me it somehow took away the pressure of decision making, I put my faith in the medical expertise and that my oncologists opinion of my best long-term outcome was what I needed to hang on to. Your family love you and they want you around for a long time to come. Thinking of you. Stay strong. x",

      "Content": "Hi. For what it's worth I think you should insist on a mammogram and appt with a breast consultant. You obviously feel somewhat reassured by your G.P but nevertheless appear to have an underlying concern. I don't think for one minute that you are a hypochondriac and if you feel that you want reassurance on what is causing the pain and/or lump then you should ask for a referal. Your G.P should be sympathetic given your family history and your mother's recent diagnosis - please don't be put off doing the right thing for you - this is about what you think and feel not what the G.P might think!!

      "Content": "Hi. So sorry to hear you are going through such an awful time - why does it seem that everything always comes at once? I was diagnosed in June and then my husband lost his job a few weeks after. My veins also packed up after my first chemo and I ended up with severe phlebitis. My onc recommended that I have a portacath fitted which sits under the skin on the chest, as they would not be happy to use the arm on the side of my lumpectomy etc. Unfortunately the day before the op the hospital phoned me to say that my insurance company had now decided they wouldn't pay for it!! I asked about having it done on the NHS but was told it wasn't offered in my area. After lots of tears and much deliberation my husband persuaded me to have it done - it wasn't cheap!! (Still having battle with insurance company!!) Anyway, it has proved a god send, all my bloods are taken straight via the portacath and my chemo same way. My arm is still very sore and tight from the blood tests before the op so not sure how I would ever have managed 5 more FEC. It may be worth asking about having a portacath fitted during your surgery for your margins and then have your last 2 FEC?? I think its a bit of a post code lottery but may be worth a battle! Good luck and take care. x",

I think it was the right decision as it took 5 attempts yesterday to get blood before the op! Can't believe that I have been a blood donor for years and years and when I need my veins they pack up! How far into your chemo are you? I am due for second fec next monday but my white cell count was very low yesterday (they nearly cancelled the op!) so am now worrying it may not go ahead. Hope you are well on the road in this rocky journey. x",

I haven't heard of a Groshong line (is it a type of picc line?) but I am sure it will help in the long run - try to stay positive, a short term bit of discomfort will definately pay off against all that poking about for a vein. Hope you are coping ok with your second fec, are you on a course of 6 like me?",
