I'll have a follow up appointment soon so I'll ask then, will put the response on here just in case anyone's interested. hope you're doing fine now. linda",

      "Content": "Hello all, I wonder if someone can answer what is probably a naive question.  I've just had 10 RT sessions to reduce tumours under my arm and in my neck to aid with nerve pain.  Will my tumours start growing again after a certain time? Or does RT last forever? Or will I have to have more RT in the future? Meant to ask these questions at the hospital but forgot! Thank you Linda",
