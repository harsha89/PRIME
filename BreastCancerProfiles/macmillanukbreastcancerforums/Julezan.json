      "Content": "Hi ladies  Reading through some of the messages on here to people's reactions made me realise it wasn't just me getting these reactions and people saying things before there brain is engaged lol I can relate to what some of your were saying although I had Breast cancer. This may sound strange in some ways I count myself as lucky because my cancer got found very early and other than having to have a mastectomy and reconstructive surgery I didn't have to have any other treatment (thank god for mammograms), don't get me wrong the surgery wasn't a walk in the park it's very hard to go through as you all know. But when I look in the mirror it's not my Body anymore as I how have one boob got north and one going south, I'm sure some of you ladies can get this feeling and I think why me!! but then I think well I'm alive and I will my grandson grow up. One of ways I cope with it a lot of the time is having a very weird sense of humour with my friends and work colleagues (I work in a small meatal health team as they get weird sense of humour) but some people who don't know you would look and think how can your joke about cancer, it's a way of coping. Best wishes to all you lovely ladies Julie X x      ",

      "Content": "Hi there Sorry to hear your having a bit of a bad time after your surgery. I found I was sore for a few weeks after my mastectomy once I had my drains out after a few weeks things became a little easier. Your breast care nurse is right it takes time for things to settle down but don't try to push yourself to much look after yourself and take it easy pamper yourself and let other people do things to help you. I found I got down but things will get better hun it just takes time talk to the Macmillan nurses and take any support they offer you. I didn't think I would ever get there after my op in August but I'm now back at work. Look after yourself and take care. Wishing you all the very best  Jules X x",

      "Content": "Hi Lou I agree with mistymoley  After my mastectomy my consultant did my reconstruction with the expander implant and used tissue matrix (this is a natural tissue) as well he told me that this is like a bra support inside the body and helps to keep the implant in place I and had two drains in place for a couple of weeks. You should of been told about the surgical bra I believe you can get them on line. I under the care of Lincoln and have found them very supportive and caring. I found the first doctor wasn't very helpful and wasn't going to do reconstruction straight away and I was very unhappy and upset as you can imagine so the sister in charge suggest a 2nd opinion which I got and I now I have brilliant consultant, explain to your new consultant how you feel and talk to the nursing staff and are there to help you and talk on your behalf. I can really relate to now you are feeling. I hope you get everything sorted out Hun x  ",

Once you have healed sports bras are great as are Geine Bras. I'm now back at work on a phased return.  I pod is a good idea as is ear plugs to block out any noise and and eye mask to block out any light I found both of these a god send. PJs are better than a nighty, baby wipes, mints, a small cushion to put under the arm of the side your having your breast taken off. Just take each day at a time and good luck with the op.
