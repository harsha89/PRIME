      "Content": "Hiya, I had 5 1/2 weeks of rads after 6 cycles of FEC nearly 6 years ago - 4 weeks whole boob then a week and a half blast down the scar - I found it a breeze - main things are flexibility to get your hand behind your head so if you've done your post op exercises you'll be fine, plus using the moisturing creams they give you to keep the skin supple - I think it can get a bit uncomfy if you end up scorched, but I managed to avoid that.  You do feel a bit tired, but I think after chemo you're a bit zonked anyway, and it's the daily back and forth waiting to be zapped adds to it all.  The only bits where they puncture you are the tattoos for placing the rays correctly and that's just a quick prod.  So main advice, if you're at all stiff in your should, get doing some of those post op exercises to ensure you're at least loosening up.  :)",

      "Content": "When I had BC back in 2006, it was triple negative so I didn't end up having tamoxifen or anything - I was 38 at the time, after 6 x fec my periods did come back after a while, if a little erratically and as I was no longer on the pill somewhat heavier.  The first year I think they were 3 monthly, then the next year monthly - then back to 3 monthly for a while - then I think it was about the next xmas I had one that lasted 6 weeks - very heavy all the time, a couple of weeks break then I had another 6 week one which left me incredibly anemic (I could hardly stand up without everything going dark).  I had an ultrasound scan and everything looked normal so not sure what caused it but I ended up going for endometrial ablation as most of the treatments involved hormones otherwise and I haven't regretted that, don't seem to have monthlies any more :D  The only other treatment I was offered involved blood thickener pills which did make a difference to how heavy they were but weren't something I thought was a good idea long term, they had side effects all of their own.  x",

      "Content": "Definitely a good idea to get the infection cleared up before you start taxotere as it lowers your immunity more than some other chemos - I spent 5 days in hospital being virtually pasteurised with antibiotics after my first dose of tax, think I must have had some low grade infections beforehand that thoroughly took advantage - have to say I felt a lot better afterwards!  Take advantage of the delay and make sure you're very well hydrated as this makes the biggest difference when on tax xx",

      "Content": "Hiya   Did you have a Neulasta injection too?  I'm having my final Taxotere a week today, I've been having a neulasta jab 24 hours after each chemo - I became neutropenic and was admitted to hospital for about 5 days after my first one and after being one a drip for a few days with fluids and antibiotics I was for the first time in goodness knows how long properly hydrated and probably a bit pasteurised after the mix of antibiotics they'd given me!  Each cycle I seem to get a sore neck/head about 3 or 4 days afterwards which lasts 24 - 48 hours, the first cycle was the worst, seems to have gotten better since.  I'm pretty convinced the biggest difference has been keeping up my fluid intake, it makes a big difference not only to the sore head/neck but also to my energy levels and also stopping a sore mouth too (a swill of chlorhexidine before I go to bed probably has helped with that too).  Assuming your temperature isn't raised (in which case give the hospital a call) other things to try might be making sure your head and neck are properly supported when you're in bed.  I tend also not to be able to stay on my laptop for more than 20 mins at a time for a few days after chemo as it does make the 'tax' headache come on.    x",

      "Content": "Hiya Not pathetic at all, it's easy to be paranoid when you're on chemo...  I would say if it feels like an ordinary cold and your temperature remains stable, you should be fine to play it by ear - but if you have any concerns your breast care nurse is a good one to call for advice - or even the chemo pager number if you're at all concerned.  The chemo unit I'm with makes you call them if your temp goes over 37.5 as that's indicative of infection that might need antibiotics.  x",

      "Content": "Hi Franoli   I've just finished 6 x tax and found a similar experience with sweet things being easier in the 2nd week - seems to knock out your taste buds for anything with fat in it - try a glass of fruit juice, you might find at least you can get some goodness into you.  I found if I didn't take omeprazole the going off food thing lasted much longer and I got a really acid tum - so if you haven't already got some, it should improve things measurably.  I found it was only the middle week that I was really off food, seems like a layer of your mouth and stomach sloughs off then and mouth gets a little sore.   Keeping very well hydrated makes a big difference in how much easier tax is to endure.",
