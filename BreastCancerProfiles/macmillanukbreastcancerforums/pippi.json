      "Content": "Hi I had bc for the 2nd time last year but not a recurrence as it was a different cancer from the 1st time.  Had mastectomy and LD recon, radiotherapy but no chemo.  Physically I feel fine but mentally I feel anxious all the time it's always in the back of my mind. I can never relax, I feel different to my colleagues always feel I'm putting a smiley face on for everyone else. I know rationally I should not think \"what if\" but I can't help thinking when is it coming back, I'm just scared all the time and wish somebody could get me to think differently. It's my thoughts that are getting me down and I don't seem to be able to control it. Renate",

      "Content": "Hi and thanks for replying, I have actually spoken to to my BC nurse and she referred me to counselling but it takes 4 to 6 weeks. I thought that people who had cancer would have quicker access. I wonder if MacMillan  can give me quicker access as 4 to 6 weeks is too far away when you need it now really.  I will contact the MacMillan nurses tonight after work  Renate",

      "Content": "Hi Sarah thank you so much for replying to me and sorry for the late reply as I am not very good with how to use websites sometimes. I will have a look at a Maggies centre and thank you for the tip. I feel a little better now but will still have counselling anyway. I hope you are well and keep staying well. Renate",
