Like you say once I have a treatment plan/full diagnosis hopefully I will begin to feel more in control.  Things just are not happening as quickly as I would like them too which I find really frustrating. love and hugs to everyone xxx",

I think you find a new normal after all this.  Speaking for myself it is always in the back of my mind. Still getting quite bad headaches and flushes (taking tamoxifin). But life has returned to normalish. Wishing you a speedy recovery xxx  ",

Just had my hair dyed and you can't tell what I have been though.  The cold cap is really hard for the first 10 mins or so but you get used to it. Just ask if you have and questions xxx",

So why not phone me to save me a trip and anxiety. Will find out next friday now. Also will need CT scan that might not be for 2 or 3 weeks. Just want to get on with the treatment. Finally decided will need to cancel holiday. Going to sneak away for a few days before eveything kicks off. Sorry for the rant but so frustrated/angry/scared in equal measures Xxx",

Ever since having chemo I have suffered from migraine which also seem to me affected by different brands of tamoxifen.  I have had a headache and neck pain for about a week now and it is getting worse. Finally plucked up the courage to book a doctor's appointment which is on Friday.  So scared it's something terrible broke down in front of my husband for only the second time on this journey last night. I guess we all have these fears. Big hugs",
