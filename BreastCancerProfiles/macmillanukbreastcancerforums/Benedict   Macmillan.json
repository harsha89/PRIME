      "Content": "Hi there, We have given this to one of our nurses, who has written the following response: Hi, I\u2019m one of the nurses on the helpline who does \u201cask a nurse\u201d on the online community. It looks like your all supporting each other really well with your hair loss and cold cap questions. As Phaedra has said there\u2019s no right or wrong decision and we all get different advice at times. So, it\u2019s best to do what\u2019s feels right for you. Making decisions and understanding how the chemotherapy and the cold cap works can be confusing. Scalp cooling works by reducing the amount of chemotherapy drugs reaching the hair follicles and not the brain itself. It doesn\u2019t work with all chemotherapy drugs and it\u2019s not always possible to know how effective the treatment will be. That\u2019s why it can be a difficult decision to make as there is no guarantee that it will work. There is a good website called my new hair that gives great advice about looking after your scalp and gives great advice when your hair regrows some of you might find helpful. Best Wishes and Take Care Ellen",
