    "Content": "Hi I had a similar lump a few weeks ago and I thought it was just my seroma which had reduced to a small lump. My oncologist wasn't sure and sent me for a scan. The following week I was called for a needle biopsy and I was right. I had an axillary node clearance on 12th April this year. I had Dcis and had a mastectomy in May 2015. I discovered lumps under my arm in March this year and the cancer was in 6/24 Â nodes but all my brain, bone and spine scans were clear. I am also stage 3 her2+. Good luck with your doc. It is early days since your surgery so it may just be a fluid swelling. I will be thinking about you. Best wishes Marie x",
