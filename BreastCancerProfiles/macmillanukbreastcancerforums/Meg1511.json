      "Content": "That doesn\u2019t sound good Karen I hope I can avoid that!!  I feel like I don\u2019t have much luck lately! It was only in the summer I had a womb cancer scare! Turned out to be Endometrial Hyperplasia thankfully. Can\u2019t be too careful these days, especially with breast cancer running so strongly in my family!  I can\u2019t feel any lumps, but the pain feel very deep so if there\u2019s anything there, even just a cyst, I suppose I wouldn\u2019t be able to feel it! Keeping my fingers crossed xx",

      "Content": "Hello everyone!  I\u2019m Megan, I\u2019m 23 and have been referred to a breast clinic because of pain in my left breast.  Only got referred on Monday (23rd) and got a call today for an appointment with a consultant on Tuesday (31st!). Impressed with the speed! I\u2019ve had pain for a few months now, it\u2019s very sharp and takes my breath away. I had an angry red mark which the GP thought was a follicle infection so I was given antibiotics. It looks better but the pain feels very deep in the breast.  My main question was what to expect at the appointment? Will I have an ultrasound or mammogram? I\u2019ve no idea! Breast cancer runs strongly in my family and so does the BRCA gene!! Thanks in advance xx",

A little apprehensive but I think that\u2019s because it\u2019s all new to me!  I do try to avoid google as well! Thank you for letting me know what to expect! Don\u2019t like the sound of a biopsy! Is that painful? Hopefully just an ultrasound and mammogram for me!!  Thank you for the hug one is always welcomed!! Xx",
