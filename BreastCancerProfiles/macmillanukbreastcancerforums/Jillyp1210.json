Yet, I continue to wear them and continue my journey....I get funny looks wearing these shoes. I can tell in others eyes that they are glad these are my shoes and not theirs. They never talk about my shoes.... To learn how painful my shoes are might make them uncomfortable. To truly understand these shoes one must walk in them. But, once you put them on, you can never take them off. ...I now realize that I am not the only one who wears these shoes. There are many pairs in this world. Some women ache daily as they try and walk in them. Some have learned how to walk in them so they don't hurt quite as much. Some have worn the shoes so long that days will go by before they think about how much they hurt. Noone deserves to wear these shoes. Yet, because of these shoes I am a stronger woman. These shoes have given me the strength to face anything. They have made me who I am.  ~ Unknown",

I have asked a couple of friends who suggested doing this that I would prefer that they found other ways to raise money and to support me. However, I also understand that when faced with the fact that a friend or relative has been given a potentially life reducing diagnosis , some people feel unable to support other emotionally and want to show that they are there for them in what ever way they feel they can. Personally I have not been ashamed or bothered by my hair loss and proudly sport my baldness out and about, in shops and restaurants , unless my head is cold wear a hat. I do have a beautiful wig but don't like how it feels and I am more self conscious in it that with out it. I should say the best thing I did was to have my eyebrows tattooed pre chemo and and so pleased with them.......for me losing my eyebrows was a bigger worry that hair! I suppose it is a personal choice about baldness, hair loss, wigs hats etc. and whilst I would never condone the brave the shave I would also allow others to do their bit as they see fit.",

Although this hasn't got any bigger ( or smaller) it is becoming painful to touch and stings most of the time. I am wondering if this is a hernia or if anyone has had a similar experience. also on one end of the tummy scar I have what I believe is called a dog ear.

The last time I went to have fluid put into it the Dr asked if I felt it had reduced in size and I said it did appear to be smaller and less full than it had been. This time they filled it again to the point where she said they could not put any more fluid in as it was now full. However 10 days on and it feels very soft and almost as if it is emptying. I am thinking that a call to the BCN tomorrow but just wondered if anyone has any advice. Thank you Jilly xx",
