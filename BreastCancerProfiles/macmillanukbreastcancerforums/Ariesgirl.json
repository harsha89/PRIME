      "Content": "Hi Kiwi H and all i wanted to get back to you regarding the Ice packs which I used during my treatment in Ireland they were instant gel ice packs which the nurses taped together at the sides and then I put my feet and hands into them. I changed them once during the treatment ie after about 1hr30 min as the taxol infusion was quite long about 3 hours. I checked on amazon and found \u201c Koolpak Original Instant Ice Cold Packs (Box of 20)\u201d these looked very similar to the packs I used. Sorry not very techy so couldn\u2019t manage to copy the link over for some reason. I have to say that I did get a little peripheral neuropathy on my soles of my feet and slightly on my left hand finger tips, but really slight and I got this after the 1st taxol, I had 4 with no change in the degree of it. Perhaps it would have been worse if I had not used anything, unfortunately who knows. They are a bit of a hassle but worth it.  Also re eye brows and lashes, I managed to hang on to them for almost all my chem 4AC + 4 T and only lost my eyebrows at the end and perhaps I was very lucky but after 2 weeks they were back and I even had to pluck as they came back with a vengeance. I lost only half my lashes on my upper right eye lid which was primarily due to an eye infection, if I had avoided this I don\u2019t think I would have lost them. personally i found Taxol much more tolerable with less side effects than my AC which seems similar to EC. I did have some constipation on Taxol and also some skin irritation on my arms however I took steroids as a preventative for this after the first one and this worked and the skin reaction didn\u2019t develop. I really felt much better emotionally and physically with Taxol. again good luck to everyone you can do this and will get the chemo done. I just finished my radiotherapy last Thursday with very limited SEs by using R1 and R2 watergel with excellent results. Which I read about on the Macmillan site. So this step for me was so much easier and incomparable with chemo. so you will get there!!",

      "Content": "Hi there is loads of info on the Macmillan site in the radiotherapy monthly thread so if you read some of the old threads you\u2019ll get info. I also did further googling too and got some other stuff. My skin is very pale and can be quite sensitive to some products but I had no issue with R1 and R2 so from my own experience I can only recommend it. So once you\u2019ve finished the poison of chemo you can move on to the cooking of radiotherapy but hopefully you will all get through it fine with minimal side effects. ",

      "Content": "Hi kiwi h  i think how you are feeling is completely normal and understandable especially for us here who have felt similar feelings. you are just about managing to deal with one part and now things are changing again. That\u2019s how I felt at the time anyway. You are doing well and will get through the next part just as you did in your previous fight with this C**p so head down and push forward and before you know it you will have got through it!!! You can do it and come out the other side",

      "Content": "Hi Karen 234 i also developed a rash on my hands and a bit on my stomach and legs after my first cycle of Taxol, I was prescribed Eumovate cortisone cream to apply directly to my hands which was the worst and prednisolone steroids to take for a few days which cleared most of it on the rest of my body. It took a bit longer for the rash on my hands to clear completely.For the next cycles I took the steroids earlier as soon as I saw a slight rash developing and this avoided it developing further and I had no further skin issues on Taxol. I had 4 cycles every 2 weeks. i also had hand and feet tingling which stayed fairly constant and didn\u2019t get worse with further cycles. all the best!",

Tried to PM you but couldn\u2019t do that either! I\u2019d love to blame it on chemo brain but probably would have been the same before the chemo! If you have any suggestions I am happy to try them. thanks! ",

      "Content": "I forgot to add  also used Eucerin moisturiser with 10% urea on my body as well as on my hands and feet which I also rubbed into my nails as I thought that I could lose some nails as they had started to lift from their beds. I used this twice a day on my feet and about four times a day on my hands. This seemed to work and I am pleased to report I didn\u2019t lose any and the part of the nail that was lifting just grew out.  This was recommended by my oncology unit. I was lucky and it worked for me. I did try wearing dark nail polish at the beginning of my chemo but this didn\u2019t help me. Eucerin 10% urea is available over the counter in pharmacies. ",

      "Content": "Hi I can only speak from my own experience and while knowing that everyone is different, I have been on letrozole (Femara brand) for 2 months and so far so good. I do have leg stiffness in the morning or when getting up after sitting but that is it and totally manageable. For me this so far it Is definitely the easiest part of the journey ie lumpectomy, ANC node clearance, 4.5 months of chemo and I am also now nearly half way through 23 sessions of radiotherapy. I also have been prescribed letrozole for 10 years. I am 49  married with two sons 11 and 13 and worked full time in a very busy job until my diagnosis. I also have a good friend who has taken femara for the last number of years and has experienced similar SEs. My personal advice to you would be to give letrozole a try see how it affects you and if you have difficult side effects speak to your oncologist and perhaps there are ways to manage them or then you can consider what is best for you. All the best for the rest of your radiotherapy and for the next steps!",
