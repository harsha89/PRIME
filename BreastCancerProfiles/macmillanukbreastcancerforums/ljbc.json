      "Content": "Hi Beedeb, like your mum I got dreadful indigestion with my course of FEC, I contacted my GP who prescribed a course of medication I'd been on previously which didn't work for me, so I spoke to BCN who prescribed Omeprazole which helped. Once the BCN had prescribed it I was able to get it from my GP, I still take it as I still have some residual indigestion.   I hope this helps.  Best wishes, Laura x",

The chemo suite I went to and also the Radiotherapy suite had hand bells for us to ring, why don't you buy a handbell or bring one in with you on your last chemo day and ring that bell loud and clear.  Very best wishes Laura x",

I didn\u2019t but it seemed to happen to quite a few.  Also be careful you may have shortness of breath as well.  I hope everything goes well for you.  Laura",
