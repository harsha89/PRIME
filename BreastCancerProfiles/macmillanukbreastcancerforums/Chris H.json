Sending you all love, on this Easter Sunday!!xx",

      "Content": "Thank you for your reply!!  Waterloo station is where our trains go to!  Not familiar with venue but would be ok if near a tube station.  Yes I could start a link for local area, (not too sure how to do that but will have a look). I have friends who have had bc but none of them live near, so it's not saying 'let's meet up for a coffee in town this week' as we need to plan weeks' ahead to meet.  However I am grateful for this site - I couldnt even look at it the first year after being diagnosed, everything scared me rigid (still does but not so bad).  Any little thing I have I think it is the cancer come back.  I know I am not the only one who thinks that, and that in itself is just so helpful!! Lots love again,  Chris xx ps Happy Easter to you too, and lovely ladies reading this.",
