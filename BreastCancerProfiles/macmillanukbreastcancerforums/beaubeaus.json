    "Content": "Hello , I was diagnosed in 2014 with her2 positive grade 3 left side spread to left lymph nodes . I made the decision to have a double mastectomy, I had to fight for it as they don't like removing healthy tissue!!! They found a few suspects in my right breast that were negative but no way was I going to spend the rest of my life worrying if and when it was going to occur in the future. For me it was the best decision I have made in my life ( I'm 58). No I don't want excruciating reconstruction made from my stomac fat and arteries. I llove my new shape, years of wanting to be trim like Twiggy, no holding boobs when you run lol. Even if I was guaranteed that breast cancer couldn't return in right side I would still have had a double mastectomy. It's your decision your pain and your outlook on life, not the decision of nurses and doctors who have not got cancer. Â You can always decide to have reconstruction years down the line. Big hugs hunny xx",
