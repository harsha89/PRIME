      "Content": "Hi After my active BC treatment of 8 chemo sessions and 15 radiotherapy sessions, I'd like to go on and have further preventative surgery (right mastectomy and ovaries removed, in separate operations).  However, realistically I realise I am going to very knackered by the end of active treatment.  But I want to get on with this surgery asap too.  I am wondering how much time I will need after chemo and radiotherapy before I will be strong enough to cope with another major operation? Does anyone have any experience of this please? Many thanks Sue ",
