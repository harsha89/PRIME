      "Content": "Interesting to hear about the Accord story...I have recently given up with all brands after a year on them...Actavis, Accord, Cipla, and fatigue in the last 6 months which just seems to get worse. I feel I need to take something so am now paying over the counter to have Femara...1st tablet yesterday so will let you know how it goes...there has to be a solution, I don't want to be tired for 10 years!! Hope you have a good experience of Teva, one I never had. Would be interested to hear other stories about Femara etc Eva2",

      "Content": "Hello Londonmumof2, I am paying £82 for one month's supply. I needed a doctor's prescription as a private patient, and was told to shop around. The first chemist quoted £127 and the second one was much cheaper at £82. It is bought by the chemist as a 'parallel import', who warned me it may have foreign wording on the packet [which it didn't], but the slip inside would be in English [which it is]. She was really sympathetic and said I should try a month first, but I can go back after a month and get the other two months if I'm happy with it. The one I've got is made by Novartis, the original manufacturer in Czech Republic and packaged in Denmark so I'm happy it's the real deal... Good luck to you! Eva2",
