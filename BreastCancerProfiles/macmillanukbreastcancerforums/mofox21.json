    "Content": "Bids24 If I understand you correctly, I think I was in your position recently. At my first meeting with my oncologist, I was told that chemotherapy offers a 3% benefit in my case. Had it been lower, she would not have recommended chemotherapy. Had the benefit been 5% she would have strongly recommended it. At 3% benefit, she could neither recommend or advise against chemotherapy. It was my decision as to whether the risks outweighed the benefit.  The Oncotype-dx test would have been offered to a pre-menopausal patient to help with the decision, but as someone post menopausal and aged 60, I would have had to pay over £2,000 to have the test done privately. The oncologist had used predict, along with her extensive knowledge of breast cancer and she was convinced that having the Oncotype-dx test would not throw up anything that would make a difference regarding my decision not to have chemotherapy.  I was only too relieved  at the time not to have to undergo the trauma of chemotherapy. As a strongly ER/PR case, I hope to derive strong benefit from hormone treatment alone.  Hope that helps you. I'm at that stage now waiting for oncotype test ti come back in 63, had a lumpectomy in Dec for invasive lobular grade 3cancer her2neg and clear lumps, my oncologist said I'm on borderline whether to hav chemo or not so confused so waiting for oncotype test to shed any light",
