      "Content": "After a routine breast screening a couple of weeks ago, i was recalled and had to have biopsies which have shown an early cancer as well as DCIS in my right breast, the care team and surgeon have advised a masectomy which TBH scares the living daylights out of me. After talking with my hubby, i have decided to go for a straightforward (if there can be such a thing!) masectomy and the use of a prosthetic at a later date. An utrasound at the time showed nothing had spread so hopefully that is so good news. To top all this off i was made redundant 2 weeks previous to this when the company i worked for went in administration ! My head is a whirl and life seems to have stopped.",

      "Content": "Thanks Dorothee I am already going mad with all this time on my hands, although the nice weather is a bonus to be at home in. I suppose like many other women with kids, it has been a long time since i put myself first and it does seem strange to do so. Yes the waiting is going to test what little patience i possess but i know it is for the best. Things seem to have happened so rapidly and i am just about catching up with reality now. Thank you for replying xx",
