    "Content": "hi ladies wide awake on the steroids after my weekly chemo and thinking about decision I have to make by 2 jan whether to have single or double mastectomy, I have multi focal triple positive ibc with lymph node involvement, definitely need a mascetomy on left side and I requested one on the right both with immediate diep reconstruction, I have been told medically I don\u2019t need one on right but they would respect my wishes and do both sent me away to seriously think about it to and let them know on 2nd jan.  I felt I wanted double as couldn\u2019t bear to go back and do it again and you can only have diep the once so just get it all over and done with in the one op.  Has anyone done this? Any advice please?",
