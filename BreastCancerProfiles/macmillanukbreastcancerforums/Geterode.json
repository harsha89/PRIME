    "Content": "Good morning ladies. Can I ask, does anyone take Venlafaxine whilst on Anastrozole? I was prescribed it by my Breast Surgeon to help with hot flushes. It worked but I stropped taking it when I start Anastrozole a few days ago. I'm wondering if I can still take it? I stopped it because I bought the ladycare magnetic but that did not work anywhere as well as Venlafaxine.",
