    "Content": "Hi all since my last post I have had my CT scan all good with that but not good with my annastetic rewiew been told Im not fit to under go operation due to enlarge heart and breathing so they are starting me on a new drug called Exemestane anyone had this as I previous had Tamoxafen annasole and Letrozole for my first Cancer and second time now this is the third time in the same breast was told I would be having a full mastectomy but this is not the case due to heart and breathing. To say I am totaly mad with my clinic is mild I wanted this done the first time I got Cancer but had to settle for lumpectomy and radiotheraphy then more tablets when it came back the Letrozole . Has this happened to anyone else . My lump is still growing so very scared and so worried that as the other tables have failed me will theses be any good.I had Lmphnodes taken first time and also told all my remaining nodes would be removed. Sorry for any miss spelling and going on but just need advice and to vent. Thanks allÂ ",
