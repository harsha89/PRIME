    "Content": "Hi - i'm new to this group. I was diagnosed in December last year following a routine mammogram with grade 2 ER+ PR+ HER2 neg invasive ductal carcinoma multifocal. Main lump was 17mm and had other satallite areas resulting in mastectomy and immediate reconstruction. My results showed all removed and my lymph nodes were clear. I did not need any further treatment other than Tamoxifen. I found recovery quite easy if i'm honest but 4 months on I feel quite depressed and constantly worry about recorrence. I can't stand the thought of living the rest of my life worrying daily - any advice? Is my type of BC more risky of coming back?Â ",
