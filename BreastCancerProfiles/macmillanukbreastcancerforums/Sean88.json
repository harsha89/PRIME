    "Content": "Hi Back in Dec 2018, i found a lump under my nipple, which was never there before. Doctor said it was Gynecomastia and went for minor surgery. Specimen of the breast was sent to lab and report note  duct shows epithelial hyperplasia with tapering tufts of epithelium protruding into the lumen. 1 month later i can still feel the lump. No pain discharge or anything unusual other than left breast slightly bigger than right breast. Lump seems to reduce in size some days and increase in other days. Should i be concern? ",
