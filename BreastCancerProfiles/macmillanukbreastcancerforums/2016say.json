      "Content": "Hi, I am currently NED with Herceptin half way. I had lastly finished radiotherapy in march after surgery and chemo finished last November. For a week now i cough randomly with no cold flu or what so ever reason. I feel it coming from chest or throat and its not vigorous. But whenever i cough i just think of my lungs being ok.  I feel so unsure what to do as only last week i saw my gp for some minor changes in my scar tissue and he made me assured its ok. Popping again there would made them think crazy about  me. My oncologist wont see me till end of herceptin n gp wont arrange a ct scan to put my mind on peace. Every little pain or change makes me paranoid. Plz help. Can i get ct scan somehow from some where.  Thanks Sab ",
