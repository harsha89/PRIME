Many thanks for your warm welcome and messages, much appreciate.  Having read the messages I noticed that I have made an error in my initial message sent, I mentioned starting Radiotherapy as opposed to chemotharapy.  I had surgery on 13th June this year to remove the lump I found in my breast.  It was Stage 1 and a Grade 3 and no spreading to the lymph nodes.  I was told that the cancer is estrogen receptor.  I'm due to commence chemotherapy on Thursday and will have Radiotherapy after chemotherapy is finishe.  I will be prescribed Letrozole tablet.  I am really scared of the side effects to be had from chemotherapy. Many thanks for your kind messages  big hugs xxx",
