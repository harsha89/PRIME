    "Content": "Hi Anna, I had docetaxel and finished it in april.  Only side effects i had was quite bad oral thrush, wasn't nice but bearable.  Nails went a bit funny and only one dropped off (big toe nail), but can hide it with nail polish as it didn't drop off until new one was half way in. You're not being a big baby it's just all the uncertainty and fear of the unknown.   Chin up and you will get there. Av xx    ",
