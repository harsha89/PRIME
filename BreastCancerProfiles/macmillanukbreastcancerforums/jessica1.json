Moral of the tale don't wait to ring hospital for help. If you vomit within 12 hours of chemo ring hospital immediately before you become dehydrated like I did.now home. 2 days later with strict instructions and a plan to contact hospital immediately if vomiting recurs.

I'm in a similar position except my lymph nodes were affected so I've been advised to have chemo. Yes I was blinded by the statistics as to what benefit I would get. In the end I asked the oncologist what he would do if he was in my shoes and he said he would have the chemo because I was young (56 ?). Anyway it has to be your choice, it's unfortunate that you don't have much time to consider all the facts.I only saw the oncologist last week and I'm having my first chemo next week.

      "Content": "Hi, I've had changed heart rhythm during chemo too. I have mentioned it to my oncologist but he didn't seem concerned. I had an ECG and that was normal. I know the chemo does affect the heart but it can be a bit disconcerting listening to your changed heart rhythm. I haven't really had chest pain but do have soreness from the surgery site. Speak to your oncologist. I also had a scan checking for pulmonary embolism which was clear thank goodness. Hope everything settles for you soon. X",

      "Content": "Hi, be guided by your oncologist. I asked ,mine about returning to work on good days and he said absolutely no way. I'm a nurse working in theatres with patients coming and going with MRSA etc. also, I'm finding the chemo pretty tough and can't even think about the energy required to work. I fully intend to return when my body feels able to cope, but until then I'm just coping with the treatment. Hope you get some support from your GP who may understand how chemo affects you both mentally and physically. X",
