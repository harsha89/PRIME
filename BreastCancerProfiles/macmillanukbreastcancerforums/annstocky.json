      "Content": "Up date   He is in so much discomfort he says he aches and feels as though he is burning,is this normal? He  looks  through the mirror and asks if it is infected, it looks OK to me no seeping,the surgeon did a clean job. He had his dressing taken off 2 days ago,How long will he feel so uncomfortable,he was so active after the op I am wondering did he do to much too soon he seems to have gone down hill tired and in discomfort and aches. It  hurts me to watch him ,i am trying to stay strong for him but knowing we have to go back next Thursday for the nodes results it frightens both of us.   .  ",

      "Content": "Hi All So is my Hubby the only man on here with breast cancer? He had his op on Tuesday,It went very well and we were so impressed how he handled the op. He went down  for the op at 11.30am and came back to the ward at 1.45.He came back smiling and in no pain,He did not have to have a drain which was good,The doctor did the mastectomy and took a couple of nodes,he had the blue dye put in him while he was under,We will have to wait two weeks now for the results of the node test.He has got to go for radiotherapy in a few weeks time. He came home the same evening,was in no pain he just said it was achey.The next morning i could not believe how much happier he was,He had me taking him out to a local auctions,later in the day he pottered around in his garden. Lets hope now all goes just as well x So now we just wait two weeks then we will no if this is the end,",
