    "Content": "Hi Ladies Ive just been trolling the web the opposite way looking to see how bad FEC will be. Im having the T first then the FEC I am day 8 of my second T and just recovering enough to be back at work. T isn't a picnic and its also probably not as bad as you think either, essentially there is very little nausea but your stomach grumbles constantly and your mouth turns to cardboard so most of my time is trying spent trying to make my mouth taste better. Bone pains are a pig but manageable and for me Paracetamol has been the best. The worst feeling is that of nothingness...you feel light headed and just weak although you're not, as in everything still works as it should it just doesn't feel like its going to. I tried 2 different methods one was steroids day 1 and 2 then stop and cold turkey the other was prolonged reduction for 5Â days of steroids and I can say cold turkey although very hard was better mentally, days of steroids are not gone for the old positive mental attitude. Big big but...today I feel better than yesterday and if like my last session tomorrow I will be back to exercising and next week all skipping around, sleeping well and thinking oh Ive nailed this Chemo lark...in short T day 3 to 6 are poo then it gets better. Please let me know whats going to happen to me? DOes your mouth taste rubbish all the time on FEC? Rosie x",
