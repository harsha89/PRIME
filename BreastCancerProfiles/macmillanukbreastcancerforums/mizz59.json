      "Content": "hello everyone .. let me introduce myself . I am a 55 year old grandma diagnosed in February with invasive ductal carcinoma .. opted for a wle and sentinel node biopsy . recovered from surgery but after receiving news that the 25mm tumour was stage 2 grade 3 bvut clear margins and no node involvement have had the oncotype dx test done .. am now waiting for those results, things seem to be going so slowly now after the initial rush and I am getting very frustrated waiting for results.. Am on letrozole for the meantime .. and back to hot flushes . I thought I was finished with these, lol x vast mood swings affecting me also , find I can cry at the drop of a hat !My wounds have healed quite well , though I still get the spasm pain in the breast sporadically . I think I will find this site a great comfort and look forward to getting to know everyone better and swapping experiences and thoughts .",

      "Content": "Hello Mumra... Three weeks ago past Friday (8th May ) my oncologist rang to say the funding was through for my samples to be sent off for the test . She told me she would have a result for me within 14 days and would ring with them .. not sure exactly which day my samples were sent off , but heard nothing yet , but expecting a phone call any day . its just frustrating every day wondering if this is the day . then getting to the evening and realising you have probably another sleepless night ahead worrying x If I need chemo then I will accept that , its just the not knowing and inability to plan anything x I am very emotional at the moment . not sure if it is the strain or the Letrozole",
