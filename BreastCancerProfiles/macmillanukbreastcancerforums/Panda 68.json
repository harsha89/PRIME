      "Content": "Hi Tonia I'm in the same position as you at the moment. After my routine oncology appointment yesterday my oncologist has booked me an appointment tomorrow for a mammogram and ultrasound. I too had surgery December 2013, completed chemotherapy in June and radiotherapy in July. I've also had 9/18 Herceptin. My lump is on the other side of my breast and feels like the end of where my lymph node may have been (if that makes sense). So like you I have my fingers crossed that it's scar tissue. You should speak with your oncologist or BCN if you have one.",

I'm not scheduled to have another echo until November/December and spoke to my BCN with my concerns. I was told to be aware of any breathlessness and ankle swelling. I will be raising my concerns again next week when I have my next injection. I have heard that some people do see it rise once chemo has finished. Let's hope we both get some kind of recovery and avoid any lasting damage.",
