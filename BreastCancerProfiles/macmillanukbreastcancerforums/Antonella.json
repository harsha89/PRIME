I will now start doing something today and you are right, I need to do it slowly and not over do it so that I can feel well about myself! I am just walking at the moment but will do something else too. I am glad that you are at your last Herceptin, how was it? I will start in January.. Take care and lots of love, Anto",

      "Content": "Hi Angela, thank you so much for your message. I want to start doing some exercise but I am not doing anything practically except from walking..I hope that by starting by doing something home..i will get more brave or less lazy..I had my surgery on the 30th July, with right mastectomy and node clearance and in Sept I started chemo..i now have 3 cycles to go and I cannot wait to finish :-) even if I have herceptin, radiother, and tamoxifen to wait for me..but one step at a time, we'll get stronger...good luck to you too, take care, Antonella",
