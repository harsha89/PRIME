    "Content": "Hello All, Having read through all the comments, and hopefully not frighten Bev too much, I wanted to add to the mix as I had different experiences with Docetaxel. I have had to refer to my \"diary\" and surprised myself about the bits I'd forgotten - anyway I had 3 x FEC, then started on  the first of 3 scheduled Docetaxel. My problem all the way through my Chemo was having the Cannula put in, and I have to say that as I neared the end (13th Cannula), I had to ask for an experienced nurse to do it, as I got more and more stressed about all the prodding and poking involved. By day 3 my taste buds went completely haywire, couldn't face water, ginger beer (my salvation in all this), tea........only thing that I could cope with was Oxo drink. Food wasn't too bad, but my husband (chief chef) made spicy food, curries, chillies etc. On the 4th day ( we have a newsagents and open up at 5.30am) I couldn't stand up after getting out of bed, my hip joints and leg muscles ached sooo much - I couldn't get down the first step and had to phone my husband downstairs, to get help in the shop as I was totally incapacitated. I just crawled back into bed, staying there for 3 days. I just didn't expect this at all !!  My feet were swollen, sore and hot - on phoning my local chemist to confirm which painkillers I dared to take - she suggested I phoned the Chemo unit and I was whizzed into hospital for a couple of days. I could hardly walk due to the soreness, but persevered although desperate for some sort of cooling like frozen peas - not available in hospital - to cut a long story short, I eventually lost all the skin from the bottom of my feet (very much like dried up blister skin which I did actually pick off very gently and plastered feet with Aveeno cream), lost finger and toe nails (new nails pushed old nails off from cuticle - not too sore, but annoyingly inconvenient, as I couldn't pick things up). My Oncologist decided an extra week off would be beneficial, as I had had such a tough time - but then she decided to change me over to Paclitaxel for 6 weeks, a much easier regime to cope with although not without its inconvenient side-effects too. However, now I'm a year down the line, first mammogram due soon (first time I've looked forward to one of them - must be mad..) and regular Herceptin injections which are leaving me fatigued after six and a half hours serving my concerned/supportive customers when all I need is a couple of hours sleep and general relaxation.  And to mirror other comments - I'm still here, hair growing well, all nails back although not very strong -  looking forward to selling the business in the future, and doing things that I really want to at a more leisurely pace (I am just shy of 60, so am able to think along these lines). Good luck to you all, hope this  has been useful to Bev and others - I've been completely open with my customers about my situation and find that talking helps me and others that have called in to tell me that they have been through BC too. ",
