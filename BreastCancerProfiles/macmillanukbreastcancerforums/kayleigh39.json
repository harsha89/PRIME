      "Content": "Hi all, I went for my scan and I'm more worried now than I was before. The man said that yes my breast is different - yes it's puckered and squared - yes I have a marble sized lump but go back in 6 months. The assistant said \"shouldn't we send her for a mammogram?\" And he said \"she's not 30 yet I don't want to put her through that!\" - so what the hell is it? 6 months I will be 30 - but last year my now marble sized lump was half the size of a pea...I'm exhausted all day every day and my breast is sore and changing still. If it was nothing, why didn't he send me away like they did a year ago? 6 months is a long time to wait for it to be \"nothing\" and if it was nothing, why do I need to go back? Arghhhh x",

I've searched for other things it could be but nothing else comes up (stupid I know), but I know what to expect with mum having it recently. I'm only 29 - 30 in September, so if I have got it, it's obviously genetic as it runs in mums family. These 2 weeks are going to be hell.  X",

      "Content": "mistymoley It's not necessarily genetic. My mum is one of four daughters. All three of her sisters have or had breast cancer and myself.  I was tested but they did not find a genetic link.  It could be a coincidence.  My mothers dad had cancer, her mother did too. Her sister died of cancer. Her other sister had cancer. Her niece had cancer and my mum had it - it's following generations but I agree it may not be but there's a lot there. X",

      "Content": "Thanks for your replies. I'm just worried that I'll get referred back to the same man who will do nothing. Whilst I was waiting for my appointment, I had a gallbladder op and it just happened to be a breast specialist who was doing it (the same man who performed my mums double mastectomy and then that same man who would see me 6 days later for my referral). Anyway, as I'm being prepped for theatre, he asks if there's anything I'm waiting on, so I said about my breast - he was so nasty and said \"there's nothing wrong - I can't see any puckering or squareness so don't think about this again!\" - so, 6 days later when I'm waiting to see about my breast he says \"I told you there's no need to come here didn't I!\" I felt like a bloody hypochondriac. Laid on the couch he is tone mellowed and admitted he saw all those changes. I'm just worried that I'll see him who will do nothing.",

      "Content": "Hi, I came here for support a few years ago when my mum had breast cancer now I'm here for me.  Okay, so two years ago during an appointment for back ache, my doctor examined my breasts. I was sent to the \"non emergency\" department within the hospital for a scan. They found a lump but because it was so small, they told me not to worry. 2 years have passed and I've never even thought about it - until a month ago. My breast had two large dents in it (same one as the lump), and the shape began to change. I ignored it. A few days ago, I noticed a lot more pain and now my breast has dropped (even the nipple) and has changed to a square shape with even bigger dents. Went to the doctor and the usually chatty nurse asked me how long had I known about these obvious changes, I told her a month and she put her fingers to my head like a gun and shook her head whilst saying my name. The room went uncomfortably silent. I looked for an explanation as to why it was different - one I wanted to hear. Doctor says \"unfortunately, your breast is significantly different to the other and looks like someone has taken an iron to it!\" The doctor has referred me to see a specialist urgently within 2 weeks. Has anyone had a change (no lumps), been referred and not been the big C? I have cancer in the family with mum only recently having a double mastectomy.   ",

      "Content": "Hi, yes I think I was hoping for them to suggest it could be something else, but the silence and no explanation was basically what made me think it was cancer.  The lump has gone in-watched for 2 years which is mad. My sister even said that today - how could they know it was there but not monitor it? Thanks for you replies x",
