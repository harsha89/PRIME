      "Content": "Goals1 .. a lot of us have irregular calcium deposits in our breasts .. some undergo a biopsy, some do not.   Is your doctor a breast specialist, or a general practioner?  Most of the time the calcium deposit is just that .. and in dense breasts they show up more as we age.  I know that is not much help, but I have had over 15 biopsies on irregular or suspicious spots .... follow your gut.  take care, Jene",

I tested negative.  However I have a great niece (granddaughter to the my sister that passed at 47) who at 45 developed bc .. had a double mx, and tested posititve on the genetic test ... so how do we know what to do in the \"family circle\"?  I say if there is any sign of bc at any age, do a double, and be sure you are under the very best bc team of doctors you can find!  Wishing you the best,",

      "Content": "So glad I found this site where women can talk to women.  My journey started over 30 years ago with a biopsy .. which I have had to date around a dozen .. most were clear, but ten years ago I was told that I was LCIS (Lobular Carcinoma in Situ).  The lower outside quarter of my right breast was removed, and I was pronounced with clear borders.  Having a routine annual mammogram, this year a small 1cm lump was noticed, and after further mammo's, an MRI & biopsy I was told I had invasive lobular and invasive ductal both in early stage in the right breast.  I sat about to find an all female group of doctors .. so glad I did the work.  My primary surgeon is the head of the breast center, plastic surgeon, and oncologist are also women.  Had a bi-lateral mastectomy March 1st and I must say that I am one blessed woman .. early stage .. found ductal in situ in the left breast, also early stage (so happy I did both).  The cancer had not gone in to the lymph glands .. now comes the decision to take or not to take Anastrozole.  I am 71 years old .. in excellent health .. very active .. what do I do?  After reading up on this medication, I am not sure I want to subject myself to the side effects, and possibly end up with problems.  I am thinking 71, and if I can have a good 10 more years .. in good health .. I do not want to take Anastrozole.  And do we really know if the medication gives us an advantage ....... any in put would be greatly appreciated.",

I am 71, in good health except my cholesterol is on the high side (& I understand that Anastrozole can push it higher).  I am still reading & blogging in hopes that I can make a decision within the next couple of weeks and tell my Oncologist.  Thanks for your reply.  Jene",

I am wondering if it  is the expander (only on my left side).  The ribs have bothered me since my surgery 3/1, but I thought it would settle down as the expander got more moist or settled in.  The right one is good, don't even know it is there, except as you say .. feels like my bra is to tight, and I do not wear one 98% of the time.  Today is \";pump up\" day, so I will talk to the Doc and hopefully she will have an answer.  take care, Jene",
