      "Content": "Morning mona Lisa, I to had a grade 2 idc,  I had a mastectomy and sentinel node biopsy, when the pathology reports came back 3 tumours had been found in the breast so mastectomy was definitely the right choice for me  (only 1 showed up on mammogram )            1 out of 5 lymph nodes was infected so I was scheduled for a full clearance in September, this is where things went wrong, my original surgeon had an accident so was unable to do the op, I was transferred to a different hospital and surgery went ahead. Two weeks later I went back for the pathology reports, he hadn't removed any! He had removed a pad of fat which didn't contain any lymph nodes so the entire operation was a waste of time.  I've just finished radiotherapy to my chest and axilla area, I must admit, I wish I'd opted for  this in the first place.  Regarding chemo, I didn't have a choice as I am herceptin positive.  The choice really depends, for you, on the size and grade of tumour, plus your herceptin status x",

Good luck, try and get some rest and eat regularly, keep hydrated and try and get out in the autumn sunshine for some vitamin D. The above tips should help with the anxiety you will inevitably be feeling, I wish I'd took my own advice I was a bloody train crash x",

      "Content": "Good evening ladies and gentlemen, I'm starting to question my treatment for bc since I joined this site  (bit late now ). Most, not all, seem to have chemotherapy first to shrink their tumour which negates the need for mastectomy which seems like a good idea to me, however I had surgery first then chemo  (masectomy ). My lump was only 2 cm and at that time only knew i was estrogen positive. When my pathology report came back I was found to have multi focal tumours, 2 of them, both non invasive unlike the one that measured 2cm which was picked up via a mammogram, also 1 lymph node involvement and herceptin positive hence chemo, I'm not saying mastectomy was the wrong decision for me, in light of the 2 multi focal tumours, it was probably a good thing, however when the consultant advised a mastectomy he didn't know all this, so I'm left wondering why he made this decision on what he only knew at the time to be a 2cm, estrogen positive tumour.  Next concern is that everyone here seems to have had a different regimen of chemotherapy than me. I only had EC chemo and herceptin was not introduced until four weeks after treatment, unlike all you herceptin positive ladies who had yours towards the latter end of your FEC and TAX chemo.  Think I need George or misty on this one, so if either of you are out there in cyberspace please shed some light if you can, I'm a bit worried that my hospital have done things on the cheap and maybe they are of the mindset 'if in doubt chop it off ' sorry for this super long post x",
