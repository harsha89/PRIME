      "Content": "Never aware that my wife was given any grading for her breast cancer, she never mentioned it , all these grade numbers are a mystery to me,but initially only had right mastectomy and the nodes stirred  up as she put it  ,  5  weeks radio, no chemo then. We did have a return after 8 years but they were good years and then another two which seemed even better . Try not to be scared as that will  stop you enjoying what you have , make the most of it as we did and just keep an eye on yourself but not so close that you can see nothing else.Jean declined very  rapidly in a few weeks and did not suffer .  I wish you all the best and hope your futures are as long as you want them to be. Life is what you make it now.  ",

      "Content": "I've had one of those scans, the sort Mia wants to give the surgeons ,   when I developed which was itnitially thought to be cancer, it is no joke if the scanner is not as bit gentle.  At one time my wife thought we could  negotiate some sort of discount on treatment  , her with her breast cancer too.  Only joking,but when we stop laughing  we start crying and that  came all to soon.",
