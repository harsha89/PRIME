      "Content": "Hi Lady Pepys, I wondered if you had heard anything further from Broomfield?  I've been waiting well over 2 years for mine at Broomfield and still no news either. Technically I've only been on the operation waiting list since September 2015 but before that I had to wait over 7 months for a scan to decide what operation I might be suitable for.  The scan request form initially got lost and nothing happend, so I had to chase and then wrong form was filled in and nothing happened, so I chased again, then there was another issue, etc etc.  I had to chase that scan ever step of the way otherwise it would never have happened. Finally it was done and I was referred to plastic surgeon who would be doing the operation in August/September 2015 who told me my operation would definitely be before the end of 2015 and I was told not to fly until March 2016  I had the pre-op assessment and then a second appointment with the anaesthetist in October 2015 and the nurses asked me then if I had been given a date for the operation but I hadn't but everyone was confident it was imminent.   Then nothing happened.... So for months and months I tried phoning the consultants secretary, the Breast Care Nurse, the appointments secretary but none of them could tell me anything about when my operation might be and why it was being delayed.  After 8 months of phoning and getting nowhere, I asked PALS if they could find out what was going on.  They told me that it was now currently planned for March 2017 ie over a year and quarter from the previous date.  No explanation of the long delay or why no one had been able to tell me what was going on.   I've heard nothing since then and I have no confidence in the new date - the pre-op assessment will presumably have to be done again after a year and a half so I should have been give a date for that by now if it was really going to happen in March. The only reason I need a reconstruction now is because my previous (DIEP) reconstruction (2014) picked up an infection that could have been nipped in the bud but I was given wrong antibiotics and so it turned into a major infection.  I spent weeks in hospital (Broomfield) on intravenous antibiotics and then months going to outpatient dressing clinics but my reconstruction was completely ruined.  So it has to be done again from scratch...but heavens when this will actually happen! I have thought of making a formal complaint abut the last few years, but so far just been chasing things to try to get them to happen. Has anyone found that written complaints work?       ",

      "Content": "Assuming my complaint was upheld ie they investigated and agreed with the basic facts: my operation was geared up for end of 2015 (albeit without actual date being set) and then nothing happened, coming after a long delay in getting a scan and before that a catastrophic failure of my previous reconstruction, is it likely that this would result in my long-overdue operation being expedited? Or would they just say something along the following lines:  sorry we didn't keep you informed about the timetable slipping by over a year and still counting, but we have been too busy dealing with other cases to fit you in, and the operation isn't happening any time soon for the same reason.  Most unfortunate but there you go. I'm happy with politely but firmly chasing things that have got stuck in the system (like my scan) but less comfortable about making a big fuss. I would worry that I would just look pushy  - perhaps all these other cases they are doing instead of me might really higher priority or have been waiting even longer? On the other hand, if there was a real chance of things being expedited if I made a formal complaint, then it would be very tempting to do so. I had heard that sometimes people do have to wait over a year for breast reconstructions and so I was delighted when the consultant told me in 2015 that if would be done within a few months.   This is my third attempt at reconstruction and my life feels like it has been on hold for years now (although I try not to think about it that way and just get on with things).",

      "Content": "This was my line of thinking. I wouldn't want to put myself through all the stress of a formal complaint if it was a pointless exercise.  It wouldn't even help future patients as I am sure the medical staff are well aware that the hospital admin system is disfunctional - it probably causes the staff all sorts of headaches as well as the patients.   If I had been told at the time there would be a 2 or 3 year (or however many years it turns out to be) waiting list, then I would considered other hospitals but it was nearly a year before I got any more information on timing and this is now starting to look like another optimistic estimate.  \" But is the waiting time any better at the Royal Marsden or the other big plastic surgery centres like the East Grinstead?   I know it is supposed to be 18 weeks but do any of these hospitals follow this? The other issue is that the NHS is now starting to restrict access to reconstructive surgery for breast cancer patients for cost saving reasons.  If I have to wait too long for my reconstruction operation, I may be refused the operation altogether. Are other cancer patients aware that these sorts of restrictions are coming in/have come in? I was originally told breast reconstruction was a process often involving several operations. However he NHS are setting a 2 operation limit for breast reconstruction.  Operations on the other breast to reduce asymmetry (which used to be commonly done) are now banned and patients will have to pay for private treatment to finish off their reconstruction. This came in last September:  \"In all cases MECCG only routinely funds two elective operations for an individual patient as part of the episode of care for the purpose of breast reconstruction- the first during or soon after the initial surgery e.g. mastectomy (although this may be delayed for medical reasons) followed by one further operation which is usually carried out as a day case. The second operation may include contra-lateral reduction, nipple reconstruction, lipofilling and removal of dog-ears. All patients must be advised that further requests for surgery to address concerns about appearance, size, position, angle or balance- breast asymmetry- will be considered to be cosmetic and as such will not be routinely funded. Funding for patients not meeting the above criteria will only be granted in exceptional clinical circumstance.\" midessexccg.nhs.uk/.../file The exact restrictions are healthcare trust dependent but if you google \"Service Restriction Policy\" you will find that lots of healthcare trusts have introduced restrictions on breast reconstruction.  As I already had 2 failed reconstructions, I may refused my planned operation if I wait too long. Would it be worthwhile asking my GP for an appointment to see someone at Royal Marsden or East Grinstead and asking them about their actually waiting times (as opposed to the theoretical 18 week target)?",

Of course you need to use a wee bit of intelligence and commonsense about what websites you look at.

What sort of jewellery issues were you thinking of?  Radiotherapy won't cause anything to become radioactive",

      "Content": "I also got a treatment plan rather than options.  Perhaps it is different in Australia. Chemo is the worst of all the treatments, cos it goes on for 4 months. I would recommend having it first to get it out of the way, then everything else is usually much easier. In terms of recurrence differences between lumpectomy and mastectomy, I presume they mean local recurrence differences not distant metastasis?   She should check that and get them to confirm whether there is any difference in survival rates between the different options.  If there is a difference in survival prognosis I would go for the one that gives her the best chance. If everything is equal in terms of survival, personally I would go for chemo first and a lumpectomy (plus rads etc etc)",

      "Content": "I'll be blunt - someone has got to say it:   You are throwing away your chances.  All of them of in the end. You could have have had a lumpectomy, now it is mastectomy.   My understanding is that most microcalcifications are indeed benign, BUT radiologists can tell if they look benign or suspicious.  Based on what you've said it sounds as if they think yours look suspicious.   A big area of suspicious microcalcifications in the same breast as invasive cancer means a much much higher chance that they are malignant.   But you are refusing even to have them biopsied.  You've told the onc no because you've done your research.  Jeepers! Clear nodes on US means nothing - US has lots of false negatives.  Sometimes suspicious nodes can be picked up on US in which case they are biopsed, but many cancerous nodes do not show up. This is why they do the sentinal node stuff You may have had a very good prognosis initially.  For all I know, It may still be fairly good but you now need more invasive/aggressive treatment.   But the longer you delay the worse your prognosis becomes and the treatment needed becomes more and more aggressive.   Untreated cancer can spread both locally and distantly.  Untreated cancer is ultimately fatal but victims often survive for several years.  In the developing world, people who do not have access to modern treatments die needlessly from untreated cancer. You may consider this to be your choice, but your life is not yours to throw away if you have friends and family. I may be criticised for being so direct and not being more \"supportive\" of your \"personal choice\", but so be it. PS  Steve Jobs also decided to delay surgery in order to try \"alternative treatments\".  He ended up having surgery too late and died regretting this decision and wanting others to learn from his mistake.  http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/oct/21/steve-jobs-cancer-surgery-regret ",

Biopsies only take a few minutes.  If it is borderline for a biopsy, the changes might be quite subtle.  This may mean that even if it is cancer, it might only be a small one (or even pre-cancer). Obviously you don't want it to be cancer, but if it is better to be small than a great big one that is really obvious on a mammogram or scan.",

The OP is only 31 so it may be worth her asking/pushing for the BRCA test before any decisions are made on double MX.  If she is BRCA, then I think the surgeon would definitely consider it.  If she isn't and/or doesn't have a family history of BC, then this would a big operation (with reconstruction) with all the risks and no significant benefit and I see why the surgeon would be reluctant. A cancer in the other breast would correspond to a new cancer whereas the main worry is recurrence which would occur elsewhere so no benefit from the extra surgery.",

In this situation doctors may feel they have to give cautious estimates based on actual survival data (ie historical). Why don't you get in touch with your BCN and talk to her about your worries about the statistical estimate.  ",
