      "Content": "I switched from a generic to Femara and it did make a difference. Although I still have bone and muscle pain, it is nowhere near as bad. The hospital  switched from Herceptin to a biosimilar drug and I started getting more pain as well as headaches and insomnia. Now the hospital has switched me back to the proper Herceptin the pain has improved. I guess we all respond differently and even if your gp won\u2019t prescribe Femara it\u2019s worth switching to another to see what works best for you. We have to be taking them for long enough! ",

She said the markers are not consistently reliable and often tend to worry people for nothing and the mammograms should be enough. Obviously go to the doctor if you notice anything unusual or have any other symptoms. Once the 5 years of annual mammogram checks are finished and you go back to every three years, someone advised me to get an interim one at 18 months privately  as that should sufficiently pick anything up. I don't know about you but my BC appeared  in-between my regular mammograms this time. ",

But can find solutions and it will get better, or we have to believe so. In the last few years I\u2019ve lost both parents, got made redundant after 23 years, got divorced, son left for uni, moved house after 27 years last year and now the hideous breast cancer so really relate.  Do you have any kind of pension that you could take either the cash free lump sum or larger amount - if you opted out of serps perhaps? Or is yours all in state pension?  I am not working either now and agree the benefits available barely cover anything. I was told the max I would get would be £280 a month with universal credit based on no savings or income which wouldn\u2019t even cover council tax and a couple of bills so have had to take pension early.  I really hope you can resolve things as financial worries put so much pressure on a relationship. The Maggie\u2019s adviser I spoke to said that if bills are a problem speak to them and explain you\u2019re having cancer treatment and can\u2019t work and some will allow you to have reduced payments for a period of time. Your partner needs to get his accounts done so that you can then have a full picture of your household.  Do let us know how you get on. I feel sad for you - it really is hard. Hope you can find some good advice and you\u2019re partner gets the kick up the bum he needs to help you.  Annie",

We all have days like this - you are not alone.  Have you thought about asking them if it is possible or suitable for you to have Paclitaxel weekly instead which is supposed to be gentler. It seems to be offered often if the T is proving hard to cope with. It could be worth calling them to discuss. I have asked to switch and they were happy to without it affecting the efficacy of treatment. I think it may not immediately be offered as you go for more sessions.  It is all scary and we cope some days better than others. Having met others from this forum this weekend who are all further ahead in treatment, it gave me hope at getting through this as they have all managed it.  I hope you can sleep tonight and feel stronger tomorrow.

      "Content": "From my understanding perjeta is given if node positive or advanced, but I could be wrong. I am ER+ and HER+++ and have had 4 rounds of EC (many hospitals dropping the F) plus am in the middle of 12 weekly Paclitaxel along with the 3 weekly Herceptin and Zometa. Paclitaxel is apparently better tolerated than Docetaxel. Previous comments are correct in that you have to have chemo alongside Herceptin and although it isn\u2019t fun, better to zap any stray cells. I think it would be very risky to refuse it. Best of luck with your treatment anyway. ",
