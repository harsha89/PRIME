My best friend in work has a sister who was diagnosed at the same age as me and he had never mentioned it previously.

I\u2019ve had a really sore stomach, it took them three days to get me some pepto which I\u2019m not particularly happy about.

It\u2019s only in one very specific area, not moving up my throat or anything. Has anyone heard of stomach ulcers as a result of chemo or any of the steroids / anti nausea drugs?

I developed a clot in my armpit which is thought to have been caused by the PICC (missed twice by the hospital when I told them about the symptoms but that\u2019s another story!). I\u2019ve been self injecting with high dose Clexane Forte since they found it. I should note it\u2019s not a \u201cfull\u201d clot as in it\u2019s only partially blocking the vein at a junction. My oncologist told me I\u2019ll have to continue taking the clexane for another 3 months (PICC removed last week as I had my last chemo). Fine, annoying but fine. Except I then saw the other oncologist who is the person overseeing my radiotherapy who told me to stop talking the clexane three WEEKS after my last chemo. I had confirmed the timescales with both oncologists so I\u2019m very sure of the two significantly different timescales they\u2019ve given me. I\u2019m still getting symptoms from the clot (swelling and sometimes pain) so while I\u2019m quite happy not to have to keep injecting myself every day I don\u2019t particularly want to risk an embolism! If anyone who has been on Clexane for a clot caused by a PICC reads this could you tell me how long after you continued taking it and for anyone else, any suggestions as to where I should go for a third opinion?",
