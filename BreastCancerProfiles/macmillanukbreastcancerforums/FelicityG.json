    "Content": "Hi Pat, I've been feeling itchy too since Chemo started back in March and have found that Pure Potions have a great range of all-natural products.The moisturiser really worked for me where even hard core chemical 'OTC' itch relief products didn't. I think prevention is better than cure and have researched the best products that are more natural and cause less irritation to the skin in the first place. I have written a beauty blog with my best findings so far if this helps:  www.icancer.co.uk/.../ I'm also now looking into good cooling/ moisturising balms as I'm in the middle of Radiation therapy. Any suggestions from the community would be much appreciated!!!",
