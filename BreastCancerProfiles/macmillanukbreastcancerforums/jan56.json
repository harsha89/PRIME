I spent the evening reading up on ILC and emailed the Breast nurse to see if they had results on the hormone receptors. She emailed me this afternoon and wrote that they were negative  and HER-2 neg and ended the email with please give me a call. I called and she started the conversation by saying I am really very sorry ( my stomach flipped and I thought OMG) then she said \" she had wrote down the wrong cancer on my information file I need to take to meeting.and infact I had Invasive Ductal cancer. I have accepted that everyone makes mistakes however my daughter is still ranting on about it.   Another interesting day on my journey battling cancer, let's see what tomorrow has to offer.

I am having a mx on the 26th March and should know treatment plan when I receive the histology. Mx is mastectomy, not sure what anc is. There are a few ladies on this site that are having their lumps shrink before having a mastectomy I am sure they will help you with information when they read your post. I find this site brilliant for support and just to air your feeling. Good luck when you have your scan. Janice ",

I was told I had Invasive Lobular cancer and would have to have an MRI to see whether or not there is any other cancer in both breasts. I am still calm and positive however it's the waiting time, MRI within 2 weeks and another 1 week before you are able to see consultant for results and I feel that I want it taken out to stop the spread of the cells through out my system as they were unable to tell me today whether or not it is contained within the breast. My cup is always half full, so positivity is the key Janice",

My husband said \" OMG I thought you liked Simply Red \" LOL. I was diagnosis with IDC grade 3 triple neg on the 20/2. I thought at the last visit I would be told when I would have the mastectomy however he told me I would have to have an MRI to see if there's any cancer in other breast and that's  on Monday. I take comfort from what all the other ladies on this site say and the general feeling seems to be that it becomes easier when you have all the results and you know exactly what you are dealing with. So take care, cup half full. Janice ",

The op was fine however the day ward was awlful and I felt they wanted me out by 5pm. I came out not able to focus because of dizzness and a high temperature and all I wanted to do was sleep could not wake up enough to get dressed. My husband had to dress me. The staff nurse said\" I would be fine\". and I do feel alot better today. I do realised not all day surgery wards are like this. If I had thought through the risks of such invasive surgery and how I may feel after the op I would have come to the conclusion I should have stayed in. Big Hugs to everyone Janice",

You haven't added what your diagnosis was, there is a section on the MacMillian site thats lists question you could ask. and it depends how much you want to know. I was disgnosed with IDC grade 3 triple neg breast cancer, had a mastectomy with no recon on the 26th March, on histology 10 days after mastectomy I was told it was at stage 2b and only i node had a small amount of cancer in it. I am now due to start FEC-T chemo. Since histology I haven't worried about at all, I know exactly what I am dealing with. This is a brilliant site and lots of lovely ladies who will help and support you Big hugs and lots of positive thoughts Janice ",
