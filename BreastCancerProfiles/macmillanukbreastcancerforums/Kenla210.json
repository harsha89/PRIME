I chopped up melon, nectarine and added blueberries today and it was lovely. Got to be better for me than all the chocolate I used to eat. Lin x Yikes! Haha!! The fruit sounds lush! I'm a big fan of a mini fruit salad, and all those antioxidants has to be a good thing!!",

      "Content": "Hiya, I am due to have my lumpectomy & OSNA on Friday - I started with 26mm lump, which has shrunk to virtually nothing. At last scan 6.5 weeks ago it was 6mm and I have had one session of chemo since then and am certain it has shrunk more as I literally cannot feel/find it at all any more! It looks like (fingers crossed) lymph nodes are clear. It is day surgery and my surgeon told me that I would be able to drive after 7-10 days and exercise after 2 weeks. It strikes me that they always err on the side of caution, and as such am expecting it to not be too bad... However, my husband has been getting annoyed with me when I was arranging for friends to come visit etc, telling me I need to calm down and make sure I have enough time to recover. I should add that I'm a stubborn cowbag, who tends to view timelines as targets to beat etc. (I even race the sat nav LOL) and rarely lets something like a minor op get in the way of plans... So my question is - how have other people found the lumpectomy/sentinnal node removal? How long till you were up and about as normal? Am I kidding myself? Also, is there anything I should specifically prepare myself for? or things that will aid with recovery? I've got my \"granny bra\" (aka 34ff non wired bra which is SOOOO attractive) at the ready, not sure if there is anything else I need?",

And when they did the ultrasound/mammogram this morning there was no obvious cancer to be seen, obviously need to wait for the histology reports, but fingers crossed it looks like the chemo did its job beautifully. They struggled to get the wire in as the tissue was very tough - the specialist said this was probably internal scar tissue from the treatment. A touch of mild nausea this evening, but I had some left over domperidone that seems to have nipped it in the bud. So... all in all, feeling really good! Onwards & upwards from here, and it feels AMAZING to be (fingers crossed for test results to confirm this!) Cancer FREE!!! Thanks for all your insights & support ladies - Mwah!

I give myself minor acts of rebellion (nothing major that will impact my recovery/treatment) to make myself feel better about it all LOL and made sure to keep as many of my plans as possible - I even went to Paris on a hen do when I was near the end of chemo, but as I say, I'm a stubborn cowbag! Will make sure I keep on top of the exercises and stuff. How quickly do you think I will be back to normal exercise? I'm thinking some gentle pilates as soon as cords have popped and back to normal schedule after a couple of weeks (I carried on working out/kickboxing right through chemo - albeit some days I was a bit slower & weaker than usual!)",

      "Content": "Hiya,  My girls are the same age as yours - 15 & 17. Telling them about my diagnosis was one of the hardest things I've ever had to do! We sat them down and just told them straight that I was poorly with breast cancer, but that it was going to be fine as BC is so treatable, but that the treatment was going to mean a tough year as the chemo etc is so rough. I also told them that I knew they would hit up google, but that there was loads of crap in the internet, and so if they had to go into the internet here was a list of sites that had trusted info - Macmillan, cancer research etc. I also made sure to tell their best friends parents so they could keep an eye too - sometimes it takes a village, and this has been really helpful too. We've approached the whole thing with a lot of humour and being very open about it all, which I think has helped. As girls, I have involved them in helping me to shave my hair off, pick different wigs, and of course obligatory \"feel better shoe\" shopping. When I'm having a rough day, I'm open about telling them I feel a bit crap, and they make me tea and we get takeaways/snuggle up for crap tv marathons. They have been absolutely brilliant, and I'm so proud of how they have coped with it all.  Now my hair is coming back, my youngest has taken to stroking my head whilst singing the rhyme \"soft mummy, furry mummy, little ball of fluff mummy\" so flattering! I would say, be open with them, give them resources for if they need to chat/find out info away from you, and make sure they know they can ask you anything about it and get an honest answer.  Good luck x",

Though found that each glass was the equivalent of 3 from a hangover point of view so be careful! Glad to say that 5 weeks post chemo, I can drink red wine again, though I don't know if I will ever love it quite as much as pre-chemo. My liver is probably thankful tho lol",

Oncologist said it was fine to take (I had 4 x EC & 4x paclitaxol on a fortnightly schedule) so I carried on taking it throughout. I am the supplement queen though - my friends and family think it is hilarious, but I think it really helped through chemo, overall and on balance, I coped well throughout with no major complications. Maybe it is psychosomatic, but whatever works right? And I needed to feel I was doing something to support my treatment. Other vitamins I take are: Vitamin D - brilliant for immune system B-complex - energy Vitamin A,C,E with zinc Daily probiotic Omega 3,6 & 9 Co-enzyme Q10 On starting chemo I also started taking Calcium as my bone scan showed high uptake so I thought my calcium could do with a boost and also magnesium (which depletes during chemo) after I noticed how easily I was bruising (like a very soft peach!) I also put a couple of drops of bee propolis & manuka honey 15+ in my peppermint tea for extra immune boost. It is true that if you shake me, I probably rattle",

      "Content": "Hiya, So I was diagnosed at the end of March, started chemo in 19th April & had lumpectomy on 15th September. I still have radiotherapy to go, and am waiting to hear if I will be doing a trial for more (preventative) chemo after radiotherapy. Before all of this, I was a sales director for a fabulous content marketing agency, selling advertising on behalf of our clients and managing a small team of 12. I loved my job! It was high pressure and demanding, but I thrived on it. My company have been absolutely fantastic through all of this. I kept working through chemo, albeit mostly from home as time went on, and they have kept me on full pay throughout. In the run up to surgery, they told me that I should step back and focus on getting better, and to take as much time as I need. They have arranged interim cover until I am finished with all treatment and have used up my accrued leave In short, fabulous! So, I have stepped back. I'm loving spending time with my family whilst I still have them at home (my kids are 17 & 15) and feel (weirdly given the situation!) more chilled than I have in years!! My relationship with my husband is also stronger now than it has ever been.  Whilst I fully intend to return to work, I have obviously had a lot of time to think over the last few months (got to do something with those sleepless nights!) I'm 40 years old, I don't want to do what I do forever, and I would like to have more balance in my life. So - I'm busy setting up my own business (an e-commerce website for people with cancer, selling natural skincare, mineral make up, hats/headcovers, picc line covers, things for managing side effects of treatment, gifts etc catering for men, women and kids/teens), I'm considering becoming a slimming world consultant (Being of the bigger boobed variety, I thank losing weight due to slimming world for me finding the lump when I did) and I'm seriously considering asking to go back to my job part-time when I'm done with treatment in order to be able to do these things. This is all super scary (sometimes more so than the actual cancer!) but I feel I owe it to myself to make changes in order to get the life I want after going through all of this.  Am I mad? Do you think this is a stress reaction to treatment and actually once it's all done with, I'll be fine settling back to how things were before?  I just don't seem to care quite so much about the things I cared about before, and I'm a bit worried that as a result, life won't ever go back to how it was before, but then maybe this is a good thing. I sometimes wonder if \"the universe\" gave me this diagnosis in order to force me to make these changes, as I believe strongly that everything happens for a reason. Maybe it's not, maybe it's just shit luck, and I'm trying to give it a reason. Has anyone else tipped their life upside down/made major life changes after their diagnosis? I think I'm doing the right thing, but would be good to hear from anyone else who has done similar. #doubtingmyself Xx",
