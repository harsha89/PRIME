Not sure that I am looking forward to it or that I will be able to cope at first as it is a very busy \"no rest for the wicked\" office. Fingers crossed all will go well and I can get back into the swing of things and get my life back on track. PS Happy New Year to all xx",

Take a good book or ipad as can be boring in between visits although you will sleep a lot in the first couple of days.  Hope it all goes week for you.  T x ",
