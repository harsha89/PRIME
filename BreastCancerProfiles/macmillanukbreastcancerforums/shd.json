      "Content": "Thanks Lisa, I guess I am just impatient to start to feel really well again. I agree it has been tough and I feel a little guilty now as I think I should feel really happy that bit is over but actually feel quite down at the moment. Cannot help feeling I haven't seen the last of this awful cancer! Always have been \" a glass half empty\" person and when I read everyone being so positive I wonder why I am not? Well done to you for getting through, hope you are well on the road to recovery. Sheila",

      "Content": "Hi, I had my last FEC (6 treatments) 3 weeks ago. I still have horrible indigestion/heartburn and itchy gritty eyes. I suffered both of these after each chemo but thought they would clear up by now? How long does it take for the side effects to go? Any idea anybody? I ma due to start 15 sessions of RT in 2 weeks time and would like to feel a whole lot better/fitter before I start!Â ",
