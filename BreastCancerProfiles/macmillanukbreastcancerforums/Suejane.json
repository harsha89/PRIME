      "Content": "You are so brilliant to pick yourself up like this and just get on with it....your tumour is very small and will be completely excised..it is 't in the nodes at all and there is a barrage of treatments to deal with it all...I had the same four and a half years ago, and I always refer to it as I had cancer, not I am in remission..as far as I am concerned I had a bad few months and now I am living my life again..you will be able to deal with it all and get over it. All the best Sue",

      "Content": "Hello Yvonne, I read your 'cry for help' and thought this lady can actually say what she wants when she she writes it down but it sounds like you think people don't want to talk about it. It could be that they think it helps if they don't go on about it either and try and carry on as normal. I mentally blocked the whole experience, actually told my husband that he had to act as normal and about six months later when it actually hit me couldn't understand why people weren't asking me a about it how daft is that? Firstly, you are not alone....your husband can't make it go away, but he could possible give you a shoulder if you tell him just how frightened you are. You have to go through it, and you haven't said what your diagnosis is or what treatment you are having, or what area you are in, but I experienced only kindness, efficiency, and my own named specialist nurse who I could still phone now if I needed to (4 1/2 years later). Secondly, now you have entered the forum you will receive lots of answers..we have all gone through this...it' s not the best BUT we do have the availability of lots of treatment and ll the research that has gone into it.....I had surgery, radium and am still on Letrazole.......none of it is as frightening as your imagination makes it. Try something like writing down your fears..perhaps starting with the absolute worst and working down to silly things ..the list may actually not be as long as your imagination thinks it is..once you have it down in black and white you can think about it more calmly, and go one step at a time. If I can help I will always answer you.",
