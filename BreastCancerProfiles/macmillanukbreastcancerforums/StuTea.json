      "Content": "I find myself in the same boat as Sammy2017, as I am too awaiting my biopsy results.  I can't tell anything from my symptoms or the doctor's reaction. Initially, I felt pain in my my right breast, but I ignored it thinking I must have slept heavily on my side, thereby applying too much pressure on it. When the pain didn\u2019t go away a day later, I saw my GP. During the examination, she noted that my breast was infected as it had turned quite red. At the time, there was no lump, and I never even gave cancer a thought. 7 Days later, when I finished my course of antibiotic, I felt a lump in my breast. For some reason, I just thought that some of the infection may not have cleared up (quite silly, I know). I waited 3 days to see the doctor, as I STILL did not give cancer a thought.  When I finally did see my GP, she said that she will refer me to the breast clinic to rule out cancer. That was when it hit me.. cancer! God!  I managed to bring my appt forward and saw the specialist 5 days later. Upon examination, he ruled out any lumps and stated that he couldn\u2019t feel any and that GPs tend to prescribe antibiotic for no reason and that I never had an infection. HOWEVER, to rule out anything, I need to do an ultrasound. My husband and I walked out the room feeling very happy. I mean, come on who want to hear yes you were right there is a lump?! So, I told my husband that he needn\u2019t wait with me now that all is well and that he can get back to his work. I had the ultrasound. There was a lump. I had to have a mammogram, then a biopsy.  The worst thing? No one would tell me anything. No preparation that it may be cancer OR that it is nothing just precaution.  I have just started my PGCE and I am a 31 y/o mother to three kids. Results are due on Tuesday and all this waiting is killing me.  Sorry. I can't discuss my worries with my husband as he is even more nervous than I am, and everyone I care about is simply out of the question as they will worry themselves sick :(",
