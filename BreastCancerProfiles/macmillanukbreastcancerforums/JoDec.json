That said, this time I took my 1st capsule only 40 mins before Docetaxel (they got me in much earlier than planned) and then I almost forgot the following day and took it a few hours late, but they still worked.

Surgery delays the start of chemo and as you are stage 1, no spread, it sounds like they want to ensure you stay that way. Chemo first will likely shrink the lump and make sure it dies before they operate. It is scary to leave it in, but after just one cycle of chemo two weeks ago, I can feel a marked difference in the size of my main lump. I am shocked at how quickly it is working. Let the experts do their job, as they want the success story just as much as you do. Good luck and please let us all know how you get on. If you are awake through the night, which most of us are at some point, there is a lovely thread that has been going for ages called 'Awake'. We will maybe see you on there.

Everyone is different and if you think you will lose your hair and that it will upset your daughter, you can preempt this by choosing a wig that looks the same as your hair now and taking your hair off before you even start. That way, you can manage the upset before chemo starts, for both you and the children. Take control of this and keep yourself alive! Xxx",

Mine is grade 3, with a tumor in the breast and one in the lymph nodes and grew 10% in under 3 weeks, although they did say that it is particularly aggressive, even for a grade 3 HER2+. You really should not wait. Chemo won't kill you, but it could be a lot harder to fight if you leave it for another few months.

I think you have taken the first step in writing it down. Try telling a few close friends now and maybe close family members that you can trust to understand how this is affecting you. There is always someone that trivialises these things, so leave them on the sidelines for now! When you have opened up a few times, telling your daughter will be a little easier, or at least you will feel stronger. No doubt you will both cry, but make sure she understands that this is something that will go away again. She may know the word cancer and if she does, it will not be in a good way, so she is bound to need reassurance and that should come from you, who she trusts.

I am going to try and if I do lose some of my hair and can get away with a hat, I won't look too different; I live in hats! I have already chosen a wig, just in case! I won't be taken by surprise either way. I am more worried by the fact that I have a real ache in my nipple. It came on a couple of days ago, just intermittent, but this morning it is almost constant. I know that we hear 'grade 3' and imagine it growing visibly fast, but this is making me think that something is changing quicker than they thought it would! I am calling the nurses first thing, just to put my mind at rest. I am sure it is just psychological, but I need to be sure.",

I have pain behind my top rib, next to the sternum and that is how I discovered the lump. I am really praying that it has not spread to the internal mammary nodes. I am dreading the results and just expecting the absolute worst. I know that isn't a good way to think, but my brain is just not functioning positively at the moment. I hope that you are feeling okay now and that I can be as strong as you are when it comes to the crunch!",

      "Content": "NikNic I have to confess I didn't even know what 'neadjuvant' meant!! But that is the plan for me too. I have a grade 3 tumour that is 24mm with spread to 'multiple' lymph nodes. I will be having my CT scan on 13th August to see if the cells have spread anywhere else. I don't have my Her2 results yet (but I have no idea what they mean!!). I won't be staged until after the CT scan. I've been told I will have 6 sessions of chemo with 3 weeks in between each. Scan after the 2nd session to make sure it is doing what it should be doing (with a possibility to change chemo at that point if it's not working?), a scan after the 5th session and then lump and tissue removal after all that. I did question it as, right now, I want the cancer gone so couldn't understand why they can't cut it out right now but they explained that it is better to shrink it first so less tissue has to be removed afterwards. And because it is in my lymph nodes I will need a 'whole-body' solution! They have already put a marker clip in to the centre of my tumour so that, if the chemo works as well as they hope, the correct area of tissue can be removed after finishing the course. Sounds like we are at similar stage of our journies... stay in touch xxx Hi again Nic, how are you? I tried to send a PM, but the system can't find you! ",

I have been told I am having 8 cycles over 6 months and that I will also be taking Herceptin, but as I have a heart condition, I will be monitored via ECG throughout.

      "Content": "Hi Suzie, the advice from Littleone is good. Unfortunately it is difficult to know what to do to prepare. I did extra exercise, both before and after, lots and lots of walking, as I\u2019d heard it helps to push it all through quickly. That didn\u2019t work, so I tried adding fasting to the exercise regime, for two days beforehand just drinking lots of water and a little fruit, that didn\u2019t work either. For the next cycle, I rested, ate normally, drank loads and loads of water (essential in all of this) and although I was still very poorly, I was no worse! I think chemo is so intense that little changes just won\u2019t affect it. Whatever SEs you get, be sure to write them down by numbered day, show them to the onc at your appt and they will know what is happening, why and how to help.  In terms of prep, an \u2019extra soft\u2019 toothbrush is essential, along with a mild toothpaste. Hand gel and wipes, (although it is proven that many infections through chemo start from our natural, internal bacteria), lots of comfies, PJs, slippers and dressing gowns, magazines, puzzle books or your iPad for chemo sessions, crackers and dry biscuits for nausea. In terms of food, I bought pineapple and on my 2nd cycle, even the smell of it made me heave. We spent a fortune on food, as it is similar to being pregnant, with cravings that can\u2019t be satisfied. I used to send poor Dec to the 24 hour ASDA at 11pm for something like cream soda or Ryvita crackers, I\u2019d eat or drink it, then within 24 hours, even the thought of it made me heave again. Don\u2019t stock up on any food stuff until you know what you like. I turned to Knorr Chicken noodle soup when I felt poorly and ginger beer helped too. We are all so, so different and until you are well into your chemo, it is an unknown. Good luck with it all and just smile when you can. Life comes back after all this and somehow, this horrible, vile experience makes it all feel better than it was before. We are here if you need us and you can PM me if you like. Good luck, xxx.",

Water and drinks were the worst though, as I couldn't find anything palatable. As soon as I liked something, my hubby went out and bought several bottles, only for me to reject it the following day. He was not impressed! I hate protein shakes and smoothies, but I love milkshake and as sweet foods seem to be unaffected, these were grea unless I was feeling sick. I did start putting ice cream in to add calories and a bit more taste/substance etc. Another of our community colleagues suggested rice pudding to stop diarrhoea, so I might try that too. I had the Docetaxel and Carboplatin yesterday and I have already got the taste change again, as my water is vile, but my throat is so dry that my tongue is sticking to the roof of my mouth and my lips. ",

Just another consideration to throw into the mix: One of the main reasons I am agreeing to RT is that it DOES reduce the risk of it coming back. Even if this is a small decrease in risk, it is worth it for me. If I get a new primary, it is curable again, but a secondary, which is what RT is designed to prevent, is not good news as many of the ladies on here will tell you. Listen to your Onc with an open mind and think really hard, as whatever decision you make this week, yes or no, may play on your mind for a long time. Good luck and let me know how you get on.

I had kidney damage, neutropenic sepsis, full blown sepsis, bacterial and viral infections. I was hospitalised after every single cycle and the first 4 were that bad that I have little recollection of my hospital stays. My oncologist wanted to stop after cycle 5 but I begged her to continue. I still have kidney damage and have mag infusions every few days, although I think that is finally setlling now. I had an Mx with full ANC and temp expanders last week on the 24th Jan and still have the drain in, going full pelt. I feel well though and am glad the cancer is finally out of me! I too refused RT, as I was concerned about the levels of previous radiation from cardiac procedures when I was young. I have an acknowledged increased risk of RT but they have carefully gone through the science and stats and persuaded me that it is worth carrying on and finishing this final, relatively easy stage of the treatment. I am sure, like all of us, that you don't want this to come back and you know that you need to throw everything they offer at it! If I can do this, you can too. You are so very nearly there and if you give up now and it comes back, in 1 year or even 20, you will never know whether you could have stopped it. Good luck and please give yourself this chance.

A 30% chance of it coming back is too high for me, so any reduction has to be worth it. I hate the Nottingham Prognostic Index, as that doesn't give me much chance at being free of this for very long at all! My primary tumour was just 22mm at biopsy (then grew 10% in less than 3 weeks to next scan), IDC, HER2+x3, grade 3, stage 3c (as I had another tumour in the axillary area) and multiple node involvement. I hate the thought of RT, but have to go for it. It may well still come back, but at least I will know I threw everything I could at it and will have no regrets.",

Re the other boob, yes, I feel the same, which is why, even though I was offered a dbl, when I was told it would mean delaying all of the surgery for another 4 weeks, I had to opt for the single. I am still worried though, as I had so much radiation when young (cardiac imaging procedures) that my risk of a new primary in the other side is higher than it should be. I hate the thought of missing it and leaving it too late, meaning that I'd have to go through chemo again! I'd had a breast exam in the Feb that was clear and found the lump in July so waiting for an annual mammogram will not fill me with confidence. I'm hoping that Herceptin doesn't make me feel rough, as I am desperate to get back to work! Xx",

I am now on day 4 after bio agents H&P and day 3 after Docetaxel and Carbo. My mouth is buzzing and my tongue is sore, plus my aversion to drinking is kicking in. Lucozade pink lemonade is the only tollerable liquid at the moment. No sickness yet, but I do feel a bit rough. I'm hoping that the lower dose will make the SEs less horrific this cycle. One tip I can give you all is for your nails, as they may well be affected. You need to start treating them now with a nail bed and cuticle nourishment oil. I had some OPI from the Netherlands, (not sure what is avail here). It has to be put onto clean, lightly buffed nails to allow it to soak through. If ridges start to appear, just buff them down to smooth, as it is the thickening of the nails that causes the discolouration and splitting, and they can lift from the nail bed if not looked after. This started to happen at the start of cycle 2 with me, but others have had it earlier and some not at all. After a couple of hours of the nourishment oil soaking in, I massage the nails and skin around them, put on a clear polish and a protecting top coat. I redo them every week, or every few days if I notice ridges or discolouration and my nails are actually in better condition than they have been for years! ",

My throat is particularly sore this time and I am wondering if I have a virus. Will keep an eye on it, but I'm not too worried. I start the Lenograstim jabs tomorrow, so that should help to fight it off. Xx",

      "Content": "Hi Sam, I feel fine for the first few days, thanks to the steroids. I woke up with my eyes stuck together this morning, which has happened after every Herceptin and Perjeta dose. I have Hylotear drops from the GP and they work wonders. Headache too, but not a migraine. That will wait until Sat or Sunday usually! I am just dreading the sickness now. It usually hits me a few days afterwards on the Sat or Sun too and I felt so ill with dread this time around. T and C today, which are the vile ones. My lovely cat won't come near me when I get home and stays clear for days as I think he can smell the chemicals in me. Hi Happy, don't be too scared. I won't pretend it has been easy, but everyone is different and you may well have a very different experience. I am sorry for your delays. What was your diagnosis, grade, stage, HE? I am assuming that you are HER2+ as you are on Herceptin? One thing I will say is that the biological agents, H & P can give you bad diarrhoea and that has been the reason I have ended up in hospital both cycles. One vital piece of info that I got from my last hospital stay, (which I have posted on the Oct Chemo Club now), is that sickness in itself is not dangerous, as although it can dehydrate you, you only bring up what is on your stomach, but the diarrhoea causes a myriad of other, far more serious issues! You need to stock up on Loperamide and the minute you feel the stomach ache that accompanies diarrhoea, take 2 capsules, then if it doesn't stop it, another after every toilet visit! Hopefully this will keep me out of hospital this cycle and stop any of you being too ill too. Good luck and let me know how you get on! Xx",

      "Content": "Hi Lady P et Al, I am on cycle 3, but the onc reduced the dose this time to 80% and it seems to have had a marked difference. I don't have my head permanently in a bucket and I am actually out of bed! I still feel rough, but nowhere near as bad as before. Apparently some of the effects are cumulative, meaning they come on sooner each time and last longer, but they aren't really any worse, whereas you get used to some of the others. My skin broke out in the most horrendous acne after my first cycle and it lessened with the 2nd and I am clear this time. My nose bleeds aren't as bad either, but then I have learnt to just leave the blood clots up there now! My most vital monitoring and control has to be the diarrhoea as they say that is what has landed me in hospital each time, more than anything else. I don't smoke, drink very infrequently, although I do love diet Coke and going to the pub etc. I exercise, have an active job and usually have loads of fun. This hit me like a bolt out of the blue! I thought I was living a good, healthy life. The emotional side of things is unsettling. I am not usually one for feeling sorry for myself, but the 'woe is me' cloud well and truly settles on me at times. That is fine though, as we all need to give in sometimes. I do have a cat, Charlie, who is a gorgeous Bengal that we rescued from a horrid breeder! We got him at just 22 months old and he was already traumatised from being put to stud far too early. It has taken 4 years to get him into a settled state, but he is the most loving baby. I just wouldn't be without him. I love dogs too and hubby is waiting for a hearing assist dog, most likely a working Cocker, which he is very excited about. What do you do with cats and where do you live? I am in North Warwickshire. Xxx",

      "Content": "Hi again Lady P, just catching up on these posts and saw your one on food. Unfortunately we are all very different and most of the recommendations I've had have not been good. You just have to try different things. My go tos are fruit shortcake and arrowroot biscuits for nausea, bananas to sooth my mouth and get potassium, basmati rice and plain pasta and strangely steak, which I usually hate! Sweets foods tend to taste quite close to my expectations, but cream upsets my stomach. Tomato soup is a big no, which I usually love, but if you are hungry and dehydrating, Knorr chicken noodle packet soup with french bread went down very well with me. Don't be tempted to save wasted food, as you are very prone to bacterial infections and be careful with take away food such as curries. Fresh fish n chips are okay as long as it is a very popular chippy, so that the fish is fresh. I'm not sure if any of these will help. Our shopping bill in the first month more than doubled, with most of the food ending up in the bin. I kept getting cravings, but the food tasted nothing like I expected. I find it all really distressing and have lost almost a stone since the beginning of September! Xxx",

One tip I can give you all is for your nails, as they may well be affected. You need to start treating them now with a nail bed and cuticle nourishment oil. I had some OPI from the Netherlands, (not sure what is avail here). It has to be put onto clean, lightly buffed nails to allow it to soak through and I also put it under the tip of the nail. If ridges start to appear, just buff them down to smooth, as it may be the thickening of the nails that causes the discolouration and splitting, and they can lift from the nail bed if not looked after. This started to happen at the start of cycle 2 with me, but others have had it earlier and some not at all. After a couple of hours of the nourishment oil soaking in, I massage the nails and skin around them, put on a clear polish and a couple of hours later, a protecting top coat. I redo them every week, or every few days if I notice more ridges or discolouration and my nails are actually in better condition than they have been for years! ",

I have a tumour in my lymph nodes, as well as my breast and both came back as grade 3 and particularly aggressive. In under 3 weeks from biopsy to another ultrasound, the main tumour had grown by 10%! I was told that surgery first needs recovery time and they couldn't delay. I start chemo on Wednesday, 3 weeks to the day from my diagnosis. If they can shrink the main tumour, it will be great, but that is a bonus, not the objective. This thing is swimming around in my blood, looking for hiding places and surgery can't kill it, it can only remove the chunks of growth. I want it dead, stopped in its tracks and the sooner the better. Much as I hate the lumps, what I can't see and feel scares me more. ",

Chemo is hard, but it is doable and worth every single vomit! Just look after yourself and prepare some of the things that you enjoy, whether that's TV recordings, needlework, crosswords etc. When you feel rough, just try to sleep, then when you feel well, keep yourself happy and occupied.

I had kept my eyelashes and brows until then, but my eyebrows fell out before Christmas and my lashes all fell out in January! I thought I had escaped that! I made sure that my nieces knew that it was the medicine that made my hair fall out. The medicine that was killing the bad cells. I explained to them that it was a good thing, as it showed how poorly the cancer was feeling. They readily accepted that and love my hair now! I used my standard shampoo when I was bald, although obviously much less. Anyway, back to hair regrowth, here are a couple of my shots, starting from bald! Next is the 13th Jan, one month after my last chemo. The next is 27th Jan, then 14th Feb, then 1st March. The last photo was me last week on Sat 24th Feb, going wigless for the first time. I hope these help. It will be a good couple of years before the top layers are shoulder length, but the underneath won't take long at all. Mine was long and I don't think it will ever be again now.

They force your pelvis and femur to work harder on the white cell production, hence the pain. I was warned beforehand and told that some people have no symptoms, but others end up in AMU with the SEs. Out of 6 cycles, I only had bad pain on 3 of them, although one was when I was in hospital (infection) and I was so hydrated I felt like the michelin man. They gave me IV paracetamol but knew what was causing the pain. It really is nothing to worry about, provided your temp is okay. You do need to drink loads though, as you need extra fluid for the cell production. Xx",

You need to prepare, but more importantly you need to relax. Rest and take it slowly, give yourself time to listen.

I am using OPI nutrient from Amsterdam in the hope that it helps as it is absorbed into the nail and nail bed. My brows can't be seen as I have a fringe on my nautural style and my wig, but my lashes.... uurgh!!! I am lucky in that I don't need to go to work if I don't want to. HR has offred to hire an assistant for me, if I do decide to work, so even then, I won't need to go out unless I am up to it. I am still stuck in hospital at the moment though! Once they have you, they don't let you go. I'll remember that next time and maybe not be so quick to let them get me in the first place! They want to keep me for another night as my white cells are too high now! They just can't get me to balance out, lol. I also have an arsenal of medication to keep me going and in readiness for my next cycle, so hopefully next time will be okay. Xx",

The anxiety I am feeling should be reason enough. Sexually my husband, usually very cuddly and intimate, has not touched either breast since the 19th July, when I told him. We both hate them now and if one is left, I don't think he'll ever touch me there again. At least if they are 'swapped' we could eventually get back to normal. I have to fight for this. The thought of being 'odd' bothers me just as much as the risk and symmetry is important too. There are so many reasons to go for it and none to not go for it.

By the following morning, they stopped all pain relief and I felt really well. I wasn\u2019t that sore and aside from being told not to move my arm too much, it all felt quite normal. I looked at my scar straight away and was really impressed with how neat it was. I was home after 2 days and recovered really quickly. It is frustrating to not be able to do much, even things like lifting pans etc, but the time passed quickly. Not being able to pick up your children will be the most upetting, but it\u2019s worth it, to recover properly. Good luck with everything. Xxx",

I am worried about kicking up a fuss before my surgery, incase it delays it, so have to wait until after the 15th now.

It will be 7 weeks post chemo when I have surgery, then a few weeks post surgery before I get the Herceptin again, so 10-12 weeks with no defence! I think I am getting the psychological chemo withdrawal that I have seen on here with others. I feel exposed and untreated. I just need to get it out of me! If I had known there was still visible activity in the lymph, I never would have risked a delay in my surgery. Thanks yet again for your help. Xxx",

I was 51 this year, so just missed out on the under 50s group! I now know several people who react horrendously to their chemo, many a lot worse than me. My first cycle saw me admitted twice with dehydration, then kidney damage, 6 nights in total. 2nd cycle I got full blown sepsis with 6 nights in hospital, very ill. 3rd cycle they reduced the dose to 80% which definitely helped but I still had 2 admissions with bacterial and viral infections and spent more than 2 weeks with awful sickness and diarrhoea. My last cycle, 4th, saw only 1 admission, but I was still very poorly and only stopped throwing up and fainting on Sunday night. I go for cycle 5 tomorrow and got a call today to say my blood is really struggling with very low white 'and' red blood cell counts, meaning a transfusion and extra bone marrow jabs. My chemo will still go ahead on Wed and Thurs but I have to go back for regular check ups. It is really hard and I'd love to say it gets easier, but that just isn't the case. It works though, so it will all be worth it! Just keep trekking through it and remember we are here if and when you need us. I am so sorry that you are struggling, xxxx. PS, thanks Karen.

I am currently getting a couple of bags of blood pumped in, as my bloods were dire, both red and white cells, so my chemo has been delayed, but hopefully just by one day. Bloods tested again tomorrow and if okay, they will go ahead. Fingers crossed for me ladies!!!",

I am sure there is a Natural Image in London and they have a massive range of styles and can order a colour that is most like your natural hair. I love my wig and people think it is real. It is lace front and top, so at the parting and fringe you can see your scalp which looks so natural. I have a photo if you want to see it on. Natural Image also accepts the nhs vouchers if you get one from the hospital. I think I paid around £100 on top of the voucher, (which is less than 2 haircuts, to say nothing of highlights), so it was worth every penny! It is synthetic and so easy to look after!

Like MrSox, I too want a dbl MX but they really don't want to do it, especially as I 'do' want an immediate reconstruction. They think the lump has shrunk to an operable size, but I will lose the nipple anyway, so to me the breast will be gone, along with any symmetry. I love my bikinis and much as I now hate my breasts, traitors that they are, I still want to wear my favourite beachwear. I know I will have scars and the recons that I have seen, that they consider successful, are not what I would call good, so I am still very nervous. My two sister in laws, one was just 34, the other 43, both had single mx and neither has gone for recon after 9 and 10 years, both very happy with their decisions. It has to be what you want.

I have been told that they think the lump is now small enough to go for a lumpectomy (MRI to confirm on the 29th), but even with a lumpectomy, they will take the nipple. To me, this is the breast! Without it, I will hate it, so I feel they might as well take the whole breast and if they are taking one, I want both off. The thought of them not matching bothers me more than them not being there. Apparently there is no difference in likelihood of recurrence, but I think I will have more confidence that nothing was missed. I am losing all the Ax lymph nodes too, but can you tell me how they checked the internal mammary nodes, as the pain that alerted me to all of this came from that area, so I have been worried about this from day one.",

As you say though, technology, knowledge and experience of this is so different now and we are all in excellent hands. I have also asked for a dbl MX as I had masses of radiation as a young woman, around 800 times the maximum considered safe dose now! I had a heart condition and had ablations and studies using high radiation flouroscopy, which is something tha they don't use now, as it is known to cause breast, bone and stomach cancer is later life. I feel like every cell in my chest area is just waiting to turn cancerous and if I can remove at lest some of that risk then I will. I am also refusing radiotherapy for the same reason. I really hope that your treatment goes well. You have beaten this before, when the odds were nowhere near as good. Your body know what to do and is obviously good at fighting, so just ride the train and get through it all. Keep me updated as to how you get on with the scans and when they plan to start treatment and good luck with it all. Xxx",

      "Content": "Hi RubyRose, I don\u2019t have a murmur but I grew up with serious conductive issues in my heart and had 9 ablations. The onc had an emergency consult with the head of cardiology before they\u2018d even give me any chemo. I was then given Herceptin, Pertuzumab, Carboplatin and Docetaxel. My heart was fine and I am now on Herceptin again for a further 12 sessions. I have scans every 2 months instead of every 3, but no problems so far. A second opinion may be frowned upon, but I would let them frown away! Get your 2nd opinion. Damage from Herceptin usually repairs itself, but if a 2nd opinion agrees with the 1st, you have to trust them. These drugs are strong and it\u2019s no good preventing cancer if the prevention means you die from the treatment. Harsh terms, but that is why we have to trust them. Good luck. Xxx",

      "Content": "Hi Ruby Rose, I didn\u2019t really focus on your hospital stay, as was more concerned with your heart, but reading your post again, I can see that you are a bit low. Chemo can be really hard; I was admitted after every single cycle and spent so long in hospital with various things. I got AKI (kidneys), sepsis, (both neutropenic at cycle 2 and full blown sepsis that went after my heart, kidneys and lungs on cycle 6), bacterial and viral infections and uncontrollable vomitting and dx. My hair fell out, along with my lashes and eyebrows, my nails all died and my mouth was sore and blistered. I am not telling you this lightly, as I usually avoid putting gory details on here, particularly to newbies, but it is important to see that others have it bad too and we come out of it flying high! I feel really great now, my energy is back, I am having loads of fun again, I look really well, my hair is growing (first post chemo haircut last week!). I just want you to know that life will be good again, but you have to climb through all of this first. We know it is hard, probably the hardest thing you will ever have to face, but every bit of it is worth it, if it gives you your life back. Just get through this Ruby. We are here if you need us, on threads or private messages, whenever you reach out! Good luck xxxx",

Is he okay now? I told my hubby this morning about you and he is now very relieved that I just have an infection. They are keeping me till tomorrow at least though. I asked if I could poss go home later today and they said I could go home, but I would have to sign to say it was against their advice! As if I would do anything to jeopardise my health at this stage! I will keep an eye out on the steroids, but they are monitoring my blood sugar, so it looks like they have that risk covered. I would hate to not take them, as I felt great while I was on those, it was only when I stopped that the sickness kicked in. Re pulmonary embolism, I know the signs, as I have had it before after a heart op in my 20s. I am not prone to blood clots, but they tore some heart muscle as they removed a threaded catheter and the clots went straight into my lungs. Where in Oz do you live and where is your hubby from? X",

I need to get 3 litres of fluid into me every day, as the bone marrow injections need it to work, so I need all the help I can get.

Stourbridge is close to me and Cov University is one of my work clients. I look after their graduation ceremonies. Very small world indeed. We were planning a move to the SW coast before this, but I'm not sure now. If I am going first, albeit hopefully several years from now, I hate to think I'd be leaving Dec on his own. At least here in Warwickshire we have close friends and family. That sounds so morbid, but I can't help but think ahead. I hope your trip goes well and if you pass by Sutton Coldfield, Birmingham, Solihull areas and fancy saying hello, let me know. It is always nice to put a face to the friend! Xxx",

I had decided against the cold cap, as I knew it still made your hair thin and I thought that when it started to grow back I'd end up having to have it all cut anyway.

Less than 12 hours to go, to find out if I will follow a similar route. I've already decided that if I need a mastectomy, I want them to use my tummy fat! There is enough of it and I might as well get a positive out of all of this. I'd be interested to know how big the tummy scar is and where it is too though. I know I am jumping ahead here, but as you can see from the time, my brain is now in overdrive!!! X",

Re poss damage, I had an echocardiogram of the heart prior to the Herceptin and I had good V function, so they were happy to go ahead. They will keep a close eye on you throughout, so don't worry too much. As Susanne says, any damage that might occur is usually self repairing. ",

This was examined this week and it has been suggested that the lump is in the interpectoral nodes, but no-one has said what this means. They suspected a blood clot, but have said this is now unlikely and they'll know more when they do the MRI. I had heard of the IMNs, but not the IPNs. Does anyone have a genuine, informed insight into what this might mean? Would these swell as a result of chemo, or is this more serious?

Poached eggs on toast don't taste too bad, but still aren't lovely. I can't really help, other than to say eat really small amounts of things, as the first couple of mouthfulls seem to be a bit better. I am trying to eat every hour or two and I just make myself eat, as long as it is not too vile. I hated all cold drinks, incl water on the 2nd cycle, but have just found that Lucozade pink lemonade is ok. The fizz is a bit strange on my mouth but it is nicer than water. Arrowroot biscuits are ok for me too, but you may well be very different. I'm sorry I can't be of more help, but just try little and often and if you feel diarrhoea coming on, get loperamide into you before it starts, as if you are not eating well, you can't afford to lose any goodness from your body.

Evidence has shown that reactive, palpable lymph nodes on the contralateral side has resulted in a better long term prognosis. They can't be sure as to why, but they don't publish unless they have evidence to show it happens. I think it may just be our body's fighting mechanism is strong; it knew something was wrong and the lymphs on the other side were reacting even though the cancer cells were not in that area. I finished chemo in December, 2 days of Herceptin, Pertuzumab, Carboplatin and Docetaxel and the pathology from my mastectomy and ANC in late January showed no cancer at all! Good luck.

      "Content": "Hi Harridamen, much of the advice I'd give is said above, but one thing that my sisters thanked me for was how I spoke to their daughters for them. They are 5, 7, 10 and 13. The eldest understood much of what was happening, but I didn't want the babies to be scared when they saw me looking poorly. I sat the 2 youngest down and told them that I had a germ inside me and that the medicine I needed to kill it would make me and the germ feel really poorly. I wanted them to know that the medicine was what made my hair fall out and made me ill, it was not the germ, so that they understood that when the medicine stopped, the germ would be dead and I'd get better again. I remember when I was 12-13 and my uncle had cancer. To me, his symptoms, the hair loss, the sickness etc were terrifying! I thought it was the cancer doing that and I felt there was no hope. I didn't understand that it was the chemo and I really wanted the children to not be as frightened as I had been. It worked and they were all fine. I know it is different as they are not my children, but it is an approach. I also just want to refer to a couple of points above. Toxophilite mentioned how evil Dr Google can be and she is so right. However, she isn't saying 'don't find out more' she is just saying be wary of untrusted websites. Macmillan, BreastCancerUK and BreastCancerResearchUK are all good sources of info and can be trusted to give you accurate information and do not resort to scaremongering. You don't need to live in ignorance and many of us understand the need to know more and how it helps us to cope. Just be careful where you get your information from and if in doubt, ask the forums on here. We are here whenever you need us. Xx",

      "Content": "Hi Kimbeelou, the HER2 test comes back as HER2+, HER2++ or HER2+++. If it shows just one plus sign, this is a negative result, 2 plus signs is borderline and 3 plus signs is a positive result. It sounds like you might be borderline, as that is not a simple yes or no result. As for changes in diet and lifestyle, I haven\u2019t drunk alcohol regularly and very rarely to excess, since I was 19. I drank around twice a year and even then just a few voddies. I have never smoked even one cigarette. I ate hardly any red meat and ate mostly chicken and fish and I was fit and healthy, an ideal BMI and did regular exercise. I still got a very aggressive, grade 3 cancer that had already advanced locally, even though I had had a clear breast exam just 5 months before! Some things, done to excess may well increase your risk, but the fact is that you have it now and if they can help to reduce that risk with proven medicine, would you refuse this? Herceptin (Trastuzumab) is a wonder drug and women worldwide have fought tooth and nail to get it, so if it is on offer, that is surely a good thing. I am allergic to Herceptin and have to have it by IV, via a drip bag over a couple of hours, with other drugs to reduce the side effects, but there\u2019s no way I would let them stop administering it. Chemo was hard and made me so ill, but I got through 6 cycles and the cancer was obliterated. The mx and anc took part of me away, but the relief to know it was no longer inside me, but being sliced up in a lab somewhere was amazing. I am throwing everything I can at this. If I lose this fight, it will never be for lack of trying. This is scary and we don\u2019t have the time to really think about what is happening, but our medical teams see this every day. They see what works and they know what to do to help. I think second opinions really help, but don\u2019t let them delay the start of your treatment; this is your life after all! Good luck. Xx",

This means the predict tool doesn\u2019t give the more positive result that we are likely to have. My predict tool results came back very bad and I was devastated until the Onc explained. Chemo is hard, but it gives us the best chance of fighting any little stray cells that just don\u2019t show up on all the scans. It wiped out both of my tumours, so any baby cells hiding away didn\u2019t stand a chance! Xx",

I was checked at the breast clinic in Feb, but my lump was found in July. I was told it had probably been there for around 18 months before it was big enough to 'feel'. If it is something sinister, you will have caught it nice and early! Good luck. X",
