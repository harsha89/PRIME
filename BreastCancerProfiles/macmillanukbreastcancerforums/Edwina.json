      "Content": "I am a 46 year old breast cancer survivor, am approaching my 7 year free anniversary. I had surgery to remove 31mm tumour in right breast, and my lymph nodes in my right armpit. Stage 3, protein positive, H3. Then followed the chemo and radiotherapy courses, and finally a year of herceptin injections.  My periods stopped during chemo, and I had no bleeds for months on end. I guess I am now getting a bleed every 10 to 12 months.  The problem is now that when I do bleed it is really excessive, big painful clots and having to run to the loo every 60 minutes or so as my super plus tampon and ultra night towel together cannot cope with the flow. I regularly leak through my sanitary protection and over night it is awful, with little or no sleep. All of this is really getting me down, my GP has prescribed transmaxic acid but these made no difference. Am at my wits end, this is starting to affect my ability to work and enjoy life again.  Any thoughts or advice please gratefully received.",

      "Content": "Hi R, I had gynae biopsy taken a couple of years ago, checks for fibroids, etc all came back as negative and my GP saying nothing else he can do, I just have to let nature run its course. I am on tamoxifen and did read somewhere about this fooling the body into thinking there will be an ovulation soon and so the body builds the womb lining accordingly. This continues for several months until gravity and your womb can't hold anymore contents and so evacuated via the excessive bleeding. I will definitely be going back to my GP, armed with your and the others stories. Thanks for your support. X",
