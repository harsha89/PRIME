      "Content": "Hi Fran, It would be my advise to definately try the cold cap option. I have very fine hair and it worked a treat for me. The only thing is after about twenty minutes it starts warming up. I was a bit pushy with the hospital and got them to change it more often...I really think it was this that saved my hair. The matron didn't like me much though but all things considered that was a small price to pay! i also had a port put into my chest wall. It was a small operation to put it in but it made such a difference as I started running out of veins very quickly. Good luck with everything Marian x",

      "Content": "Hi Judith, your last message was so sweet...it brought me to tears.I am so glad that my website was a help and that today was not so bad for you and you got to spend quality time with your boy. As Lorraine said there are lots of ladies on here who are all being treated for breast cancer. The forum is called breast cancer and you find it by clicking on forums on the top of the page on the left side. There is a drop down menu where it says cancer type...select breast. Futher down on the left hand side of the page will be a list of all the forums relating to breast cancer. The one most of the ladies use is just called breast cancer.... Everyone is so nice and supportive and  it has been a massive help to me. I will request you as a friend on here so if you need to ask  about anything just drop me an email. Take care Marian x  ",

      "Content": "Hi Akepede, I am so sorry about your news. I just wanted to say that I got diagnosed this time last year. I didn't thnk that I would be OK ever again also. I had to have a mastectomy straight away due to the nature of the cancer then chemo, rads and hormone treatment...yikes!!! It does get better though. Once a treatment plan is decided on it is much easier to focus.  This year has not been the best ever to say the least but most of the treatment is over now and I am more or less back to normal. I am back at work, drive, go out, go on holidays. I couldn't imagine that I would ever get my life back...but I have. My website is http://www.marians-site.co.uk. Please feel free to have a look, although it is not finished. I set it up in the hope that my story would help other people who are also affected by this disease. Take care Marian x",
