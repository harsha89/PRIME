      "Content": "Hi there, Sorry to hear you're going to be having Chemotherapy : ( The only advice I can give is to not drive after the therapy. The first one I had made me feel really 'high' and I think I would have crashed the car - I didn't drive for about 4 days after. I still don't drive to/from Chemo because you feel a bit dazed from all the medication. I'm in a similar situation to you, don't have help to hand so I get the fridge filled and make sure I'm stocked up on medication and that's about it...the SE's are best treated before they kick in, at least that's what I did with the first sitting, then just take it from there. Make sure you can stay in if you need to for a day or two. Try not to worry (I know...ha, ha) but once you're in you'll find ways to cope and then it's just a case of ticking off the days 'till this 'poop' (as Leolady says) is over... All the best and good luck Restory",

I dislike attention, I enjoy it only when I'm making people happy, like most people I suppose. Everything we concentrate on intensifies, so if I concentrate on the cancer in some way it grows, if the people around me identify me as 'ill' I can't get away from being ill and leave space to remember that there's another part of me that's completely healthy. If people concentrate on my illness, I'm never going to get a day off and that day that I wake up and feel at peace with the world someone is going to (unknowingly, albeit meant kindly) rain on my parade by bringing the subject up. As I've said before, I have kept my cancer private, not an easy choice, not possible for most, but it works for me. We all live and learn, sooner or later the penny will drop and those you're being so patient with will understand and appreciate all you're going through and all those expletives not said... xxx",

I forgot one morning and dashed into the ladies loo, washed my breast and had to dry it with those awful scrapy paper towels....so I recommend a small towel in the handbag for the duration of! I only had one day when my breast was really, really red and it was the day after my Herceptin jab, so I put it down to that drug or to a reaction to the cortisone or some such thing. I also had/have some strange pains but the doctor said it was 'normal' as the breast has been bombarded and I will see how it goes as I have a RT check up in a month. Anyway, I didn't have any problems and now the redness has disappeared too. Good Luck with the therapy!",

      "Content": "I have no medical training but this is my tuppence worth! And remember every treatment is different, and everyone is different, and I mean   e v e r y o n e! I think that you will be told the following, take a list of questions and note down the answers as and when and if you don't get the answer to something ask! And if you forget, don't worry, you'll have other occasions and the ladies here will be available! The terms I have put in ' ' are the questions you MIGHT want to ask depending on what the doctors tell you. A good idea is to take your phone and charger and tape the conversation so you can listen to it later calmly, I know my brain switches off after it's heard 2 or 3 new terms and I get in a right old panic trying to keep up! So, If the cancer is 'localised' (not invasive) and has a low 'grade' (like 1 or 2) and small (like yours) normally it's taken out and you only have 'radiotherapy'. Which I hope will be your case, fingers crossed! AND, you can stop reading HERE, you'll never need to know the rest! : ) If not, and forewarned is forearmed and all that, here goes: The bigger the tumour size, the more likely it has spread so the fact it's small means it hasn't been there as long, (mine was 2.2cm) which is good news for you too! Mine was 'Stage' 1 The post surgery 'biopsy' will tell you how aggressive the cancer is, 1, 2 or 3 mine was 'Grade' 3+ so one of the most aggressive forms If it's 'invasive ductal carcinoma' basically this means: invasive = chemotherapy, because the cancer cells aren't confined to the tumour, they have moved into the surrounding tissue. So the chemotherapy is given to protect you. They take out sentinel lymph nodes when you have the op, to check if the cancer has spread, as it's the first place it goes. The lymph nodes are under your arm and so you'll come out of surgery with 2 scars, not one, and a sore shoulder because of the position you are in during surgery. The surgeon told me almost straight away that he thought they looked clear and he was right which was a relief. If your cancer is 'ER positive' it means its hormone sensitive, which is a good thing, because you can be treated with a drug called 'Herceptin' which is a biological therapy and is very effective BUT you have to have your heart monitored continually. My K1 (I saw someone else mentioned it) was K1 67 = 45% , which means the cancer was fast growing but 45% is not very, very fast, it needs to up over 70% for that which is way toooo much information, so I'm going into overload territory! My treatment is Chemotherapy (4 Adriamycin, the nasty one that makes your hair fall out) every 21 days, followed by weekly Herceptin and Paclitaxel (12 sessions - but my hair has already started to regrow - hurrah) I'll then have Radiotherapy 25-30 daily sessions.  Herceptin every 21 days for 14 times (about a years worth) 5 years (at least) of Hormone therapy I'm also having injections even month to get me into menopause but I think that's also age related (I'm 50) And whatever the doctors tell you, it's all doable!  I hope I haven't overloaded you with too much info! I hadn't yet found this forum back in November when diagnosed and I wish I had as I'm the type of person who wants to know everything so I can feel more in control (  of the uncontrollable : )))  ) You mention you feel well and look normal, which is great, who knows, hopefully it will continue like that! Now my cancer has been taken out, as far as I'm concerned I'm completely healthy. I have the Chemotherapy that will protect me, drugs to combat the side effects, a wig and make up to make me look well for me and my family and the outside world. The only thing that I can't control 100% is what's going on in my head, and thats why I'm on this Forum, to share (which is therapeutic) but also to read all the wonderful posts full of advice and love!

I realise I've deprived myself of support and who knows what else but I think the peace I have and the time I've given myself to come to terms with what's happened is priceless.

I can't help connecting these events, maybe it's just a coincidence, but it keeps niggling at me...and reading you think the same it seems to click Oddly enough, when I went for my RT appointment, the doctor went through a questionnaire which asked about health and lifestyle smoking, drinking etc and sleeping habits, next time I go I'll have to ask why...so sleep must be a contributing factor  I'm curious to know if stress or bad sleep habits have as much 'weight' as smoking or drinking in all this malarky...",

I was completely freaked out, terrified to be honest - but a couple of close friends who have had cancer, (one is a doctor, another a nurse) both repeated to me that I should consider it as 'protection' which seemed weird then because I'd never have thought of it like that, then a friend arrived for a visit and said the same thing - the word 'protection' became my mantra and it's the word I used to explain what was happening to me to my kids too.

(I agree with Denisa on the potential low immunity problems too.)  I started climbing the walls too so I can imagine how you feel.  On the up side I took up Pilates which I love, and it's more sociable which was good for me at that point in my therapy. Oh, and I skiied during chemo too, (I've skied for 30 years but for the first time I was terrified of breaking a bone and interrupting the therapy : O) It was fantastic and I felt amazing! A friend of mine ran all through her chemo so I imagine it really does depend on how you feel. I'm sure the benefits of keeping active are enormous, just listen to your body and don't overdo it and take care of yourself. All the best and hope you keep muddy!!!

It's all stuff that I could handle, it never got on top of me too much! I had low white blood count too but the injections and drinking/eating bone broth helped with that as I didn't want to miss therapy, as you can imagine I was impatient to finish it all as it does seem never ending, but the good thing about weekly therapy is that the time flies... I found filling my time with 'nice' things to look forward to helped to keep anxiety at bay, a pretty walk, a relaxing bath, a trip shopping, weekly lunch with a friend (!!! oh thank the lord for those friends who don't mope or pussey foot around but get you up and out - hoorah!!!)

I ended up thinking that the little chemo army was going to be in my system and doing its job for a good while so that thought calmed me down considerably!   High temperature, infections and low white blood count are all common reasons for taking a chemo break. Lots of ladies have chemo-surgery-chemo and if I\u2019ve understood correctly it\u2019s one of the best types of therapy   I had the BRCA test too but after surgery while having chemotherapy. I hope some lovely ladies and gents will be along soon with their words of wisdom.... in the meantime a really massive virtual hug to you... All the best x",

That\u2019s how it was explained to me when I was diagnosed. It\u2019s a lot to get your head round at the moment and you\u2019ll exhaust yourself so please try and take a step back, a deep breath, remember you have as much reason to think this will be the best case scenario as the worst! We are all living proof that this is all stuff that can be handled. And whatever is thrown at you there\u2019s something to throw back at it! Loads of stuff in fact It might be an idea to tape your conversation with the doctor/s on your phone so you can listen to it later or make notes of q\u2019s and a\u2019s -, my head was a fuzz during the first appointments, but my husband is a robot from that point of view and could repeat it all back to me word for word  : o  scary but true   I hope your feeling better and that these messages are  of help...big hug x",

The prices are very low too. Below is the link, it'll give you an idea of styles and prices.

I just told mine that I didn't have cancer anymore because it had been removed and now had to take medication to protect me from it coming back, which they were fine with.

The PICC line was fantastic, didn't have any trouble with it. I used it for bloods too, it's a real must. I had 16 chemotherapies, some have 3, everyone is different. Take it a step at a time. I finished chemo in August and radio in October, it was all really tiring. The side effects are manageable with drugs.You'll get through it, we alI got through it...good luck and keep posting - no one will understand like the ladies on here.   Grade 3+ invasive ductal. Her2 Positive. I had 4 EC + 12 x weekly Herceptin and Paclitaxel (02/18 to 08/18) / 25 Radiotherapy (finished 10/18) / 15 Herceptin injections (until summer 2019) / 5 years of Decapeptyl/5 years of Letrozole hormone tablets",

My hair didn't start falling out until after my second chemotherapy, then I had my head shaved (zero, big mistake) but left longer sideburns because I went the wig/hat route and it made my hairline look more natural. Leave a bit of length to your hair so it lies flat on your head, otherwise when chemo sets in it feels very painful and prickly especially when you go to sleep. Good luck with your therapy xxx",

The only thing that kept me going were 2 friends who both had cancer in their lives, one told me to do everything, to not leave anything to chance as this is too big. The other told me \u2018What you\u2019ve got to remember is that chemo is protection, it\u2019s protecring you and keeping you well...\u2019. I admit it was hard to accept but I finished active therapies a month ago and  I\u2019m devastated I had cancer but so grateful we have all this medication and therapies that give us a massive chance of a full recovery. Eyebrows? Mine fell out at the end of chemo, in the meantime I used a pencil to fill in the gaps and they weren\u2019t too bad. On the up side they grew back within 2 months. I think microblading is a good idea before therapy starts as chemo make your skin very sensitive, I think Leolady56 had hers done, maybe she can advise? If you don\u2019t cold cap, hair wise all I can say is I\u2019ve had so many compliments for my hair since I stated wearing a wig, I\u2019m now in a tizz because I\u2019ll have to take it off sooner or later and go back to \u2018normal\u2019 hair!!

Also, leave an inch or so of hair, I made the mistake of getting it shaved and the stubble was really painful when my hair was falling out, especially when lying down in bed...just some advice to avoid restless nights!

Breathe, surround yourself with loving, positive people, things will settle down and you'll find a new 'normal' All the best and keep posting, we know where you're at and we need you too...xxx",

      "Content": "Hi there, So sorry you're here, I hope this might help but please feel free to ask specific questions as and when...and please take what I say with a pinch of salt, everyone is different and some ladies get few to no problems and you might be one of the lucky ones! I had 4 EC and am now at 5th of 12 Paclitaxel/Hercptin and although the medicines aren't exactly the same, the psychological stress is... Get the PORT or PICC, I had the EC without and regret it, my veins have turned to wire and hurt, I had the PICC put in before the cycle of 12. You will probably feel Ok the first couple of sessions, but keep taking the medication to keep the SE's at bay, don't suffer unnecessarily. I found the 4th the worst. You'll probably get upset stomach, nausea, I take probiotics to help with that, plus cold ginger drinks, lemon etc were a godsend for nausea. Fresh air and keeping active is also a great help. I shaved my (  v.long : (  ) hair off, because I wanted to take control of something and I couldn't bear the idea of it falling out (no cold cap option here, otherwise I would have tried it). If you decide to cut, leave an inch or so because your scalp gets painful and shaved hair is prickly and painful, it'll keep you awake at night. After the 4 EC I was a psychological wreck with the prospect of 12 more sessions. That's when I found this community (hurrah!) The good thing is once they start they are weekly so getting bloods done and PICC cleaned and then therapy doesn't leave much time to worry about the next one because it's on you before you know it. The 2 drugs take between 3 and 4 hours to administer and the side effects are less expected. I have the usual stomach upset, metal mouth but also a reduction of my vision and aches and pains, leg/foot pain etc but it's usually episodes that don't last very long and so far completely bearable, I don't need medication for it. The psychological part is harder, I often meet a friend for lunch, go to a bookclub, for walks, I took up courses, pottery, pilates, stuff that was new and challenging and kept my mind off all this malarky and gave me stuff to look forward to (not just to dread) and help/ed fill my head with 'nice' thoughts. I have kids too but I think cutting out some time for me really makes a difference, so if you can, be a bit selfish, I know my kids were surprised but not upset, I switched up the love, caring, hugs, button for them and my husband and it seems to have worked because if I'm Ok, they are Ok...we all know that's the first rule of mumming : ) The actual sessions are fine, you get other drugs before the Chemo that make me a bit woozy. The PICC has been a godsend, I go alone and have always has the most lovely chemo companions that make the time fly with their chat... You will be fine, it's something we can and will do, and we will come out the other side stronger and wiser, and on those bad days we'll be here for you. All the best xxx",

      "Content": "Hi there, Been reading through the posts, I'm so glad you are all out there sharing your news! I had the first of 12 weekly Herceptin and Paclitaxel on Monday, (via a PICC line). It was fine, they gave the Herceptin first, followed by the Paclitaxel, it took about 3 and a half hours. I've been taking the back up medication (gastro protection, cortisone etc) for 3 days but had tummy troubles yesterday and today, fingers crossed it was just a blip! I'm feeling fine, my energy levels are better than with Adriblastina, have even been able to cook as the nausea has subsided... I also have a little hair growth on my head, fingers crossed! Eyebrows are a no go area though!   : / I was really panicking about having 12 more sessions! I asked my oncologist if I could have only 4 (bigger doses) every 21 days but she explained the results are much better this way - I suppose because the medication works it's way out of your system so having it more often means you are better protected. She also said the side effects are less this way, which also makes sense as the dose is lower. Sooooo, my tactic for getting through the 12 weeks (which was really getting me down psychologically) came naturally as I got an invite to go out Sunday and from then on I have been filling my week with little 'nice' things to do, I went for a lovely long walk, went to the cinema, did pilates, met a friend for coffee...the idea being that my week doesn't revolve around chemio now that its weekly but the chemo fits into all the 'nice' things I do during my week and that way it becomes secondary...I hope that makes sense For the moment it's helping me see the light at the end of the tunnel... I hope all you lovely people are with me visualising the May Chemotherapy zapping those cancer cells away like an 80's computer game! On the subject of supplements, when I asked my oncologist about taking iron tablets with B12 she very diplomatically said she didn't like the B family...so there's my cereal out the window too! maggiemee x make-up is the answer...",

      "Content": "Thanks Leolady56! Hi there, I'm new to the community : / I was operated in December, have already had the 4 'red' chemio every 21 days and start the 12 weekly Pacltaxel/Herceptin and wanted to know what it's like from anyone who's in the throws of, or has finished this cycle of therapy. I had nausea, upset stomach, sore arm and tiredness with the first 4 (red) but I was expecting it to be sooooo much worse so am counting my blessings I didn't wait for my hair to fall out, but cut it all off, and too short to boot (my scalp was tender and the 'stubble' hurt) - I wish I'd left it a bit longer as It hasn't ever fallen out completely which might have given me a head start when it finally starts growing back...or maybe not...hmmm Anyway, the lovely lady who cut my hair left me some 'side burns' which haven't fallen out and are pretty useful when wearing a wig (they help 'blend' into the hairline) or a hat/scarf as it gives you the appearance of having hair underneath - just a bit frightful when your head isn't covered, which in my case is neverrrrr! ; ) Apart from all the other drugs that go with the therapy I'm taking some extra 'natural' stuff, vitamin D, probiotics for my stomach/intestine, organic aloe arborenscens (syrup) to detox and am having Epsom salt baths. So, back to chemio, the idea of having n.12 sessions, every week, starting next week, is really freaking me out, as is the state of my veins after only 4 therapies - I'm going to see about getting a PIC line in, any tips warmly welcome! Pacltaxel / Herceptin - What are the side effects? (I've Googled it but I find Google is bad for my health iykwim) Does this therapy have less side effects than Adriamycin? What are your veins/arm like after 16 therapies? Anyone taking any 'alternative' medication along with the prescribed stuff, if so, what? Has anyones hair grown back during weekly therapy with these drugs? (...she said hopefully...) Sorry, too many questions?! : ) Any advice warmly welcome! Thanks for being there peeps, you really do make a difference... x Life's tough, but so are you x",

I start on them Monday and have been told I will have them both in one sitting...now I'm scratching my head wondering what all these different protocols mean in terms of treatment. A friend of mine explained that Herceptin is biological, it attaches itself to Cancer cells and assassinates them...good huh!  Being HER2 positive is positive then! (excuse the pun : )) (P.S. I had my PIC line put in today, two nurses jollied me along, and it was fine thank goodness!
