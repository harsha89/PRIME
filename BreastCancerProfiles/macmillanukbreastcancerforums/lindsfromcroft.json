    "Content": "Hi Clair, I had my first FEC treatment last Thurs (3rd March) and the administration of the drugs went well. I opted not to have the cold cap as I don't have thick hair...so I have had a number 2 all over to prepare and I love it!! Today I have got hubby to take me down to a number 1 and again I like it. Side effects for me have been headaches from hell and feeling very sick...even the anti-sickness meds mae me feel sick but I am persevering with it. I am also sleeping for England....very tired all the time...can't wait for the ulcers and cold sores to erupt lol. I am 1/6th through (20% done) so I try to hang on to that...but I must admit I am dreading the next few months if I am to feel like this or possibly worse. Good luck for wednesday, and if it's any consolation, just reading on these forums you'll see that most people sail through the treatment (I'm just a wuss!!!)Â  Take care hun x x x",
