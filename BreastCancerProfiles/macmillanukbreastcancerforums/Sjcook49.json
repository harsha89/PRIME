      "Content": "Hi ladies, I'm new to the site and after having a double mastectomy I'm doing ok. One has been deflated ready for radio next week but the other implant is very hard. My consultant has said we just have to wait and see how things go as it is early day but wanted to ask if anyone has any practical advise and what has been your experiences. I have to say, the implant inflation / deflation is one of the most bazar experience I had. Just mad. Thank you",

      "Content": "Hi ladies, I've been having the worst time ever since posting this 3 weeks ago. The Senior Radiographer was very dismissive, rude and all in all very unpleasant which was quite a shock as upto now I have had the most amazing staff looking after me in every department . The doctor in the radiography department said to go back to my GP !!! So kept coming to a brik wall So, due to my own research. I now know that I have a Frozen shoulder. The NHS web site even says there is a direct link between a Frozen Shoulder and BC so why this was never mentioned to start with I don't know. At the moment I'm maxed out on pain killers of every type and taking Oral Morph but nothing seems to be helping much and the night time is the most painful ðŸ˜¢ I couldn't sleep without sleeping pills, so getting very fed up with it now. My GP has been very supportive and I'm booked to have cortisone injections on Wednesday But I'm so pleased I have now found out what it is, though not happy with the diagnosis as it can take Months to get over a frozen shoulder. Deep tissue massage is recommended, so will be asking my consultant on Wednesday if this is an option, as I've had my lymph nodes removed, I don't want it to effect my lynfatic system. Blooming heck, just when you think you are coming to the end of treatment, you get thrown a swerve ball. Chin up and soldier on Sharon xx",

I had my mastectomy with lymph node removal in Jan and started Radiotherapy last Tuesday which has been a breeze compared the the awful chemo but woke up this morning with the most excruciating shoulder pain I just don't know what to do with myself. Taken paracetamol which didn't touch it and not Tramadol and still no relief, just don't know what to do. Any suggestions....",
