      "Content": "Hello,  Just wondering if anyone out there has undergone risk reducing surgery? I am at high risk of developing breast cancer due to a combination of my family history and personal medical history. I have recently been referred back to my local family history clinic - as I am now at an age where the doctors believe that they need to start managing my risks - and risk reduction surgery (bilateral mastectomy) was brought up as an option. In a way it seems like a very sensible and logical approach to reducing my risk dramatically... however, it is a significant undertaking and (as I am well aware working in healthcare) surgery is not without risk.  I'm wondering if there are any ladies on here who have gone through this process who would be willing to share their thoughts/feelings? How did you find the pre-surgery pathway and the surgery itself? Do you feel that you made the right decision in hindsight?  Thanks,  AJ",
