    "Content": "Hi - I had a masectomy and reconstruction on 1st August- have had fluid drained 4 times now and I too have found 2 hard lumps. I asked what they were when having the ultra sound yesterday and was told one is a 3cm clot which should disappear in a few months and the other was a valve on the implant. So I would ask consultant or person driaining your seroma. Hope this helps a little. x",
