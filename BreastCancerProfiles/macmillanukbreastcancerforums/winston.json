I agree with Catherine I have deffinately had moments where I have wondered around like aimless sheep, drifting about, not being able to settle except to find my ever faithful kettle where I can make myself a strong cup of tea !!   My tea and ginger biscuits have been a comfort, and when hubby comes in from work, he usually brings me in a selection of cream cakes or sweets !!  They are a comfort !!  Perhaps think of something you really like, and gets loads of them brought it, spoil yourself !!  I watched tv yesterday and they asked Kylie Minogue who had breast cancer a couple of years ago and who had chemo as well how she coped, and one thing that stood out for me was \"be kind to yourself, and be a bit selfish in taking care of yourself, even if it isn't in your nature to do so.\" It does get better !!  Take each day at a time, if you have a bad day, you could wake up the next morning and feel totally different.  Sometimes I feel a bit low, but then the next day I wake up in the morning look out at the birds, and nature taking place and it is very refreshing !!  Everyday is different.  Hope this helps !!   Take Care !!

Good luck with the mx, you will feel soooooooo much better when it's gone.   I wish I had taken a little cushion in with me just to rest it over the gap where my boob had once been, I have big boobs and I think I shocked a couple of patients when I got up and went to the loo, and they realised I only had one boob !!  All my prosthetics were at home !!   Just a thought.   My mobile phones and ear plugs were a great help, and a mini fan a great help as it gets soooooo hot in hospital, and if you end up on a ward where are there are a few elderly people, they just hate the cold !!   LOL !!!  Wet wipes were good too !!
