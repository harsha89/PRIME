Moisturising is important, I used Epaderm because that suits me as I have eczema and I can't use certain other moisturisers. Just find one that suits your skin and apply it as often as possible. The staff were told to keep an eye on my skin because of the eczema but apart from a bit of redness I had no problems.",

I saw an advert for John Lewis saying that they had specialist people who did bra measurements for people who had a mastectomy. The nearest John Lewis takes half an hour to drive to so I rang to make sure that they had someone who could cope with my odd ones. I went along and the woman who measured me was extremely helpful, kind and caring. She presented me with a few bras which were pretty and fit well. OK, the one I chose was more expensive than M&S but I felt that it was worth it.",
