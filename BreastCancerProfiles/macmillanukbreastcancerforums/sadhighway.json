      "Content": "Hi   I had a double mastectomy, no reconstruction possible at this time. I have been informed that they removed some of the chest muscle which is why they could not rebuild me. My Chest looks like a very bad butcher was let loose in surgery. The scars are at not slightly semetrical and i had a burn well above my chest. When i asked i was told it was where the heart monitor would have been. I did go to my GP he said we could ask for another opinion from a different hospital and he would help to m ake sure i was rebuilt if it was possible and the letter her had indicated it was possible. I have had my next appointment from the surgeons... Apiril 2012. On of the breast care nurses gave me false information. Told me my other breast could be removed and rebuilt on the second operation as a prevention. She said she would discuss this with both the surgeons as they did not appear to be communcating.  Now I am in limbo. Wait to see the oncologist was their answer. Guess whos having chemo.......They would not even tell me that. If you say something your a trouble maker . If you don't your left in the dark. MDT meetings are great ...i doubt they would attend. Then as they said they dont discuss oncology so oncology wont discuss surgery. We the end product of their contempt don't count. Sorry I moaned on here, perhaps I should just be quiet. One little silver lining ...I found a great macmillan nurse. She was some help and pushed a little to get some important information. They did leave me some muscle but had to remove some as the tumour had advanced. Does muscle grow back is what i now feel i need to find out?   The fact that you read this gives me some comfort. ty x",

      "Content": "Hi   I was diagnosed with cancer in 2003 had rt and chemo ...thought i had it beaten.   In March 2011 i found a lump.. The consultant said she thought it was scar tissue... i was left with my diagnosis until about October when my breast changed shape. My Gp sent me to the consultant again ..another mamagram and MRI . They still thought it was scar tissue but would discuss it and let me know ( this was getting close to xmas). Xmas eve i was asked to attend what i thought would be a biopsy. My  appointment was only to take a look and tell me they were going to do a biopsy but they could not do it on that day as they needed a radiographer to direct the biopsey and i was called a mystery woman. January 4th..Bisopsey was that i had cancer. March 2011 i had a double mastectomy,they were going to rebuild me at the same time. March 21st ( my birthday) i was woken and told they couldnt do it as the cancer was in the muscle of my chest. Now im being told the results are that i dont have a clear margin annd i dont have an unclear margin , then to mystify me more they wont tell me anything about the oncologyst other than her name and tell me that she will see me in a few weeks. I have already had radiotherapy  and one lot of chemo. What do I have to do to get a straight answer ? where can i get one? Do they know what the answer is?   Has anyone had this trouble to get answers, if you have please let me know how you got answers/      ",
