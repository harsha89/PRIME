      "Content": "Hi everyone It has been a while since I've been on here, but felt the need to write something today! Today is one year since my last chemo session.  I am proud that I have survived the last 18 months and have been back at work since July. Last year, I had my last chemo, a lymph node biopsy, mastectomy, radiotherapy and my ovaries removed. In my head I am proud that I have dealt with cancer and am currently cancer free. I am classed as high risk for it returning because they found 12 lymph nodes with cancer, after chemo.  However, my body is still suffering. I am on exemestane which makes my joints hurt. I struggle to use my hands at times and walking can be difficult. I have wear and tear in my lower back (was picked up in all my scans) which is also aggravated by tablets. I have tried a different one, but it made me sick all the time.  I have lymphedema in my right arm and am very sore still under my arm from the surgery. My skin has healed after radiotherapy, but I still get really bad pain deep down underneath my skin. I also had a blood clot return, the original one was in my picc line, but the strange feeling in my arm had never gone, so in the end (after a lot of nagging) I was given an ultrasound and then diagnosed. I am on tablets though which is fine, last time I had to inject myself daily. There have been some positives during my cancer time, I have amazing work colleagues who still look after me now, I have a few fantastic friends, I have made good friends with a colleague who was off on maternity leave whilst I was off (although I struggle to hold her son for long due to my arms!!) and we have a puppy who is the best tonic ever and gets me out of the house for walks - albeit slow walks! He did also though run off at high speed from me in the week whilst on his lead so my arm is very painful at the moment. I am usually careful as to hold him in my good arm, but was opening a gate and he just ran in the opposite direction (he can be a bit nuts!).  I don't know why I feel strange today. I really wanted to feel positive and I can't actually believe it's a year since last chemo. I can't really talk about this with my hubby, I don't think he gets it at all.  It was my plan to put something on Facebook today saying look how far I've come (I don't have 100's of people I know on FB - they know I've been ill, but I don't put anything else about my cancer on there) because some I haven't seen for a while due to geography and they probably don't know how I am doing and I want say wow, but I feel sad. I want to thank my friends who have helped me through things, but I feel a hypocrite for thanking family. My husband makes me feel like he isn't interested in me and my kids (13 and 9) have just carried on as normal throughout this whole time and whilst it has affected them deep down (my son is now convinced that every ache and pain he has is cancer - it takes a lot of effort to convince him that he is healthy!) they have only just started helping if I ask. I know this seems ungrateful and I can't tell anyone how I feel, but I kind of feel I've done it on my own!!  Apologies for my essay, but does anyone else still have pain everywhere or feel like this? My Mum died of bc aged 51 (I am now 42) so it has been hard for my immediate family. I've had genetic testing done and I do not have the BRAC gene which is good news. Thank you if you have managed to read this and not fall asleep lol !!!  Jane X",

      "Content": "Hi Karen Thank you for writing after my essay. It is reassuring to know that I am not alone, and yes, I feel bad for moaning when I know I am a lucky one too. I was interested when you mentioned your teeth. I have had trouble with my teeth since chemo. After every chemo I used to sneeze really badly for the next week and each time I could feel my teeth clamping down and bits of teeth coming off. I have even had to have a tooth out. I tried to say to my dentist that chemo had affected my mouth, but was not believed. I was also sick a lot so that must have had some effect. I mentioned it to my bcn who had never heard of it before!!! Odd! I hope you have a healthier 2017 too.  Jane Xx",

      "Content": "I have had counselling! It went well, but then the counsellor doesn't have to live here lol!! Most of the time I am okay, but particularly on the milestones, 1 year since diagnosis and now 1 year since chemo finished I feel emotional.  I suppose I would like it to be acknowledged by family that I have done well! I always give my husband warning that an anniversary is approaching, but nothing! Am not after flowers or gifts, just an acknowledgement.  I would try counselling if you have the opportunity. It does help my mindset and has helped me in situations where I think the worst, but she taught me to think in a different way. Good luck. ",

I didn't think I would be on my own and it is reassuring to know that others feel the same (although it's pretty rotten that we do feel this way).  I know that it will take time for life to get to a degree of normalness and I am grateful to be here.  I think I am always going to be emotional on anniversaries of treatment/ end of treatment. In one months time it's the 1st anniversary of my mastectomy so will try to think of it as the day my cancer left my body!!!  I would also like others to know that it is possible to get through the awful journey of cancer. For all my down days I have good days too.  Thank you to all for your lovely words.  Jane x ",

      "Content": "Hi Naz I finished chemo just over 3 weeks ago and am due to have a mastectomy and diep reconstruction next Monday. My Consultant gave me all the options, but did say that this route would be the best option for me. It is a scary thought of a long operation, but she did say to me that this option would be best for me in the long term, I just had to be prepared to put the time in now to let myself heal and recover.  I will need radiotherapy afterwards, but with this reconstruction I can still have it, although of course, there are always risks.  Personally, I didn't want an implant, but this is just my choice. It was a difficult choice and I was tempted just to have a mastectomy and no reconstruction.  Good luck with your decision. I don't think there is a right or wrong answer, it is whatever you feel most comfortable with. Jane ",

I am now having toothache around the affected teeth and wondered if anyone else had had the same thing?

I work in a school and was diagnosed in August '15 and on one day in the October all the staff wore pink to raise money for breast cancer. I was sent a photo of my office colleagues in their pink outfits which initially did upset me, but I was so touched that they cared enough to show their support. It was in our weekly newsletter as well that that was what they were planning on doing (it was a good way of telling everyone I was off work, I'd had some parents asking me if I'd quit my job!). Some parents donated money too and they raised over £300. I still get emotional now thinking about it!  There are many ways of showing support. I also feel sick every time I see the advert with the lady having chemo. My son asked me if my chemo was pink like hers, I did get upset and said yes it was and it makes your wee pink too!!!  X",

I think when I have got through the surgery next week and am home I may start to think differently. I will still have radiotherapy to go, but that is just another way of making sure that cancer has left my body.  My last chemo was only 3 weeks ago so still have some of the side effects in my body so when they go, again, that will help.  I wanted to join the website when I was going through chemo, but chickened out, which was a really silly thing to do.

      "Content": "Hi Fiona I have had lots of people telling me that their friend or family member had been cancer free for years and that I would be fine and that I was coping very well with everything and was always positive, whilst inside I just wanted to shout that I wasn't fine and was scared that my children would grow up without a Mum.  I have always been honest with my children and told them that I had to go through some pretty horrible things, but I was prepared to do it so they still had a Mum and I want to see them grow up. I am being strong for everybody else and have coped well most of the time, but am also nervous about the surgery next week. I think when you have children it makes you aware of your own mortality and having cancer doesn't help with that at all!  I hope your chemo is going well and you are not suffering too much. Some of mine were slightly better than others.  Jane ",

I had a lymph node biopsy done last week so have been to theatre and had a general anaesthetic so that side of it does not worry me (too much - it will as time gets nearer). What is causing me more worry and stress is that I am convinced that I am not going to get better. There is no medical evidence to suggest this, I am very lucky as I am expected to get better, but I feel someone needs to tell my head this! My only previous experience of cancer is my Mum who had breast cancer and died in her early 50's. ( I am early 40's). I try so hard to be positive and everyone I know says how well I am doing, but in my head I am not doing so well. Does anyone have any advice please? ",

I am on exemestane and have been since May last year. I did come off it due to joint pain and went on anastrozole which made me sick so went back on exemestane (with medical advice). I am now really fed up with the joint pain, every single joint hurts in my body and is seriously stopping me from living properly. On Sunday my foot was so sore I couldn't walk! My BCN suggested going on tamoxifen, I am post menopausal (through tablets and ovaries removed), but am worried that coming off exemestane may affect my future chances. I am high risk for cancer returning. I would really appreciate any advice.  Thank you  Jane ",

I didn't have reconstruction due to an unexpected problem, but out of chemo and radiotherapy I actually found the surgery the easiest bit! I had drains put in during surgery and then had to have the district nurse come round and check daily on them, but they were not that bad, just inconvenient.  The hardest bit in the hospital was looking at my chest the next morning, but if you are having immediate reconstruction you may not feel quite so bad, I don't know. I have one big boob and then nothing, it looks odd!  The best way to think of it is that on Wednesday that nasty evil cancer will be removed.  I hope it goes well and I will be thinking of you.

Life just sucks at times! I have just posted on here about bad radiotherapy burns, but actually everyone says how healthy I look and how it must be nice that the treatment is over. It makes me want to punch them! I feel like shouting from the roof that it's not over, I still have hormone treatment and will probably need more surgery.  Do you have one of those little heat pad things that you can microwave? They are quite good.  Just keep thinking that after your next chemo you only have one left and that is a massive achievement. I had pains everywhere, neck, shoulders, mouth (hospital can give you mouthwashes if you need them), generally just my whole body! Keep strong, it does get better.  Xxx",
