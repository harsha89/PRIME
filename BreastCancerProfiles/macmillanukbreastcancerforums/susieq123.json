They said its due to the chemo/the menopause. My bloods are ok they said. Struggled with chemo but light at the end of the tunnel now with one more. I feel I need to move on but can't. Is it a risk on your health with scans?",

I know you're right when you say trust the experts, but feel a bit out on a limb. Are you back in work? If not when are you thinking of returning?

He said I'd find something else to worry about. I did join a course but everyone was terminal so I was really depressed when I came home. I already do a mindfulness course which is good but with chemo I haven't been able to attend as much. Just wish I was back to normal, feel like i've had a rug pulled from under me.

This anxiety is driving me mad, need to get back on track but finding it hard.  I've been looking for survivors stories but no one seems to write after years being diagnosed. I think my tumour was a grade 3 stage 2a and to do with hormones. Most of my friends have had two different types of chemo. They've kept me on FEC all the way through but don't know why.  I feel I spend so much time asking questions when I have my oncology apt that they're fed up with me.. My BC nurse hasn't even been in touch. Got so many fears . re going back to work........When?,  should I go on a holiday abroad or stay in this country. Argh I think everything's overwhelming me again!!! Just want to run away! . Thanks both  xxx",
