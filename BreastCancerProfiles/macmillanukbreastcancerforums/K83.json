      "Content": "Hi Rach1969, I had a picc line inserted and it was the best decision ever. My first round of chemo it took 4 attempts to insert the canula in to the back of my hand as my vains like to play hide and seek lol. Then another nurse managed to get the canula in to a vain on my wrist, but within minutes my wrist ballooned up and it had to be removed. In the end it had to be inserted in to the big juicy vain at the crease of the elbow as a last resort (they don't like to use that vain to administer chemo). One of the nurses emailed my consultant right there and then to request that a picc be fitted before my next round of chemo.  The picc line was inserted in theatre and took about 15minutes.  My only complaint would be that you have to go and have it flushed and dressings changed every week, but for me it was worth it. It made taking blood for tests easier and painless, and the two times I was admitted in to hospital, fluids, antibiotics and paracetamol administered via the picc line. I even had a blood transfusion via the line.  One last thing, removing the line was easy and painless. All the best xx",

      "Content": "Hi TootsBees, Yay! You're closer to finishing chemo! I found that it took me longer to recover with Docetaxel, about 10-12 days. My body and joints ached all over, from my jaw to my ankles. I was admitted in to hospital after my first round of taxel, as I kept throwing up. Skin peeled around both my eyes, leaving the skin underneath red raw, I had peeling on my hands and feet, along with sore mouth and tongue etc. My 2nd round of Taxel I found that Ibuprofen worked better than Tramodol, paracetamol, co-cordomol etc for me personally. I made sure to take them every 4hrs regardless of whether I was in pain or not. My 3rd round, I read online that Loratadine an ingredient found in allergy/hay fever medication such as Clarytin, helped to reduce imflammation in the body. I asked my oncologist about it and he explained the science behind it (I can not remember), but he also said that a few of his previous patients have sworn that Clarytin worked for them. He said that he was happy for me to give it ago if I wanted to, and instructed me to take 2 everyday for 3days starting on the morning of chemo. Well I took 2 the day before chemo lol, and 2 every day for 7 days lol, along with Ibuprofen every 4hrs. I found round 3 of Taxel to be the easiest, I can't say for sure whether it was because of the Clarytin, but I can say that the body aches were not as intense. You will get through this, you're nearly there. Xx Karra",
