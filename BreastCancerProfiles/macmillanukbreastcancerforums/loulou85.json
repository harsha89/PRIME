      "Content": "hello everyone  this is my first post. Im having my first chemo 3rd sept. and i am really frightened..its FEC-T and ive got a pre chemo chat 27th august. i cannot sleep for the worry of how it will go and my main worry is chemo brain, although the whole thing is really scary to me. i live on my own and ive arranged for my dog to be looked after for a while as im frightened of infections and managing him generally as he his very boisterous. My family are not interested in my BC and i feel very isolated. I do have one good friend but she is not ever so well herself but does what she can.",
