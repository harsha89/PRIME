      "Content": "sascha, I know how you feel about appearing naked in front of your partner, my wife felt the same. It did not worry me and I'm sure your partner will be the same. What really mattered for me was that the cancer had been removed. as for your treatment at the rt suite, it was very bad and yyou deserve better. The nurses attending me were more concerned about my modesty than I was and I received all the best care I needed. Good luck with your further treatment, Colin xxx",

I can't talk about your mother's expected quality of life, but I can say what my wife experienced. The treatment she bore stoically and when it was finished and she got her strength back we had some wonderful times together. Take every day as it comes and make the most of those good moments. Your mother will have many happy days yet and I hope you both enjoy those to the full. Good luck to you on this journey and come back often for support. Blogging and chatting are not difficult. Tell your mother I'm 74 and if I can do it so can she. The chatroom is a great place to meet friends who are great at lifting your spirit when you are feeling low. I look forward to meeting her there. Colin",

My own experience relates to prostate cancer, and I was diagnosed 2 days before Christmas, and referred for biopsy. Everyone except the urologist thought it wasn't cancer, but those three weeks until the biopsy were terrible (I could have used different words there which would have described it more accurately!) Make sure your family are with you every step of the way; they will want to share your worry and the elation when you get a good result, which is what I hope for you. If the result is not the best, you will need their help to get through this experience. Good luck on this journey and let us know how you get on. Colin PS. I'm post treatment and just been told the onco believes a cure is on the cards, I've got my fingers crossed until my first test at.... Christmas! C.  ",

Sadly I have heard of other cases where even terminal patients near the end of life have been hounded. Have you spoken to Macmillan? There is a system of advocacy available, where someone can help put your case and maybe even arrange for Lewisham to visit you. I'm sure perhaps the advocates would find ways to put your case without all the swear words that I would want to put in! The helpline number is 0808 808 0000 open Mon to Fri from 9am to 8pm. Good luck, Colin.",

Tamoxifen is successful in improving survival rates after breast cancer, but some people find the side effects too hard to continue. My sis in law spoke to the oncologist and was switched to a different drug which suited her better. My advice (as a man) is see how you get on with it and then talk it over with your team. Good luck, Colin Ps. Good luck with the RT I had a very good experience and was well looked after. C",

I've no experience of RT for breast cancer as you can guess, but certainly there would be no undue effects at this early stage. Were you asked to hold your arm in an unusual position? I should mention it to the team when you see them and they may be able to do something to minimise this pain. Colin xxx",
