    "Content": "Hi after some advice I used cold cap last week on my first FEC treatment and was able to bear with it. Since then though I have had a constant sinus headache (I do suffer with sinus pain) and always am unable to sleep solidly for more than 4 hours. I am taking paracetamol but am in so much pain wondered if anyone else has any advice. Thanks",
