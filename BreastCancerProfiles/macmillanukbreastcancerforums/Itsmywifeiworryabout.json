    "Content": "Hi helsbels18. Sorry for butting in everybody as I have a different type of cancer but this applies to all of us. I used to work for a small company that did not have a HR department (that was one of the jobs I had before my operation). I just want to say that it is not just small companies that have to comply to the rules that people here have so rightly mentioned. After my op I was not even allowed back to start in the office. They accused me of poor performance and sacked me. I could not let them get away with it. I had a chat withÂ  a lovely lady at the Maggies at Charing Cross. I was put in touch with a lawyer who had had similar problems to us (and won). She helped us enormously. With her on our side, my wife and I were able to reach a settlement with the employer (who I cannot mention but her initials are AK and she is an author of books for childrens food).",
