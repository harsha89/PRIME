      "Content": "Hi Mags, Thanks for replying and sharing your experience! Can't believe how many women are suffering from the same side effects! I do a half hour walk with my dogs...was doing it daily but just haven't felt able lately so my partner has been taking them on her own... I have written down the Naproxen so will ask my GP. Think I will also have a word with oncologist in a fortnight. They must be able to advise on something to help with the side effects! Thanks again.  Lynn Feeling more hopeful! ",

      "Content": "Hi all. I have just joined the group and hoping for some advice. Was diagnosed with breast cancer 2 years ago. It was quite low grade. I had a lumpectomy followed by 4 weeks of radiotherapy. I was then put on Letrozole. After about 6 months I found the side effects too difficult to cope with... really bad aching joints... unable to sleep... just felt pain throughout my body and no energy. I was then put on Anatrozole...same problem for a year... now on Exemestane and unfortunately it is no better  I have been diagnosed with Osteopenia and Osteoarthritis but the pain from these tablets makes it so much worse. The oncologist has agreed for me to have a 2 week \"holiday\" Don't know what will happen but I am hoping pain will ease. I have been told it wouldn't be wise to stop altogether. It is getting me down because I am used to being active. Sorry for the long text x  ",

      "Content": "Thanks Mazza 10 for sharing your experience. I have done some research and had long chats with the oncologist and they seem to be very against stopping the  drugs. His words were \" oestrogen is like oxygen for your breast cancer cells. If you don't take the oestrogen inhibitors the cells are fuelled by oestrogen\" I understand that...but as you say I need some quality of life now...xx",

      "Content": "Thanks so much Warm Auburn for your reply...and lots of practical advice! I have been taking paracetamol at night but it doesn't do anything... Yes I will definitely ask for some anti inflammatory tablets. Just need to stop trying to do everything I am used to doing and getting frustrated when I can't. A friend said I might have fibromyalgia yesterday  Not sure what that is but I feel sure it's a side effect of the tablets. Feel like I'm moaning all the time xx",
