Have you got a bag of tricks ready to amuse yourself during treatment, book, kindle, sweets? I'm just off for bloods and clinic ahead of chemo tomorrow, must have a water and some marmite on toast ahead of both these, keeping those veins plump for them",

      "Content": "I am slightly concerned that I am being too trusting and accepting of all that the surgeon and possibly the oncologists tell me, sometimes I read things here that contradict what will be happening to me.... I'm due a mastectomy on the right hand side and all along I've been told a node clearance, I only found out I had cancer when I found an egg sized lump under my arm, maybe that's the reason for the sure fire total node clearance, although the egg is now more mini egg than egg after chemo All along, the surgeon has said that I would be able to have immediate reconstruction, despite the fact that I will be having radiotherapy afterwards, but what is the thickening of the skin risk of having the reconstruction ahead of the radiotherapy, I'm going for the implant option? The new perky lefty that is coming to match the perky righty, could I push to have the pair done together or do I just add on those extra weeks and hope it's all done by the end of the year? On a slightly shallow front, the wedding that I had already booked before this is early Feb and the months keep on rolling by and when I got the diagnosis, I did point out that I had just booked my wedding and I needed a matching pair for early 2017 (which seemed such a long way off at the time) I have my next appt with the surgeon mid July just after my chemo finishes and feel I should have gathered my thoughts by then I am triple negative hence my topsy turvy, back to front treatment Thanks in advance for any advice",
