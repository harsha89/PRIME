I had 6 fec, finished in March last year, I to starting losing my hair on day 15, I shaved it all off about a week later because i couldn't stand all the mess ( i'm a bit of a clean freak.) I wasn't completely bold until well after fec number 2 and after number 3 it started to grow back, it was just fine and fluffy but it was hair. After it falls out it's just another step in the whole process, just tick it off and get yourself to the end, i found losing my eyebrows and eyelashes much more upsetting as i just looked so different but the body hair going is great. Take care, love Char xxx",

      "Content": "Hi everyone, I have always read posts since being diagnosed with triple negative breast cancer exactly a year ago today, i had a lumpectomy, 6 fec and 15 radio, I am not doing very well at the moment emotionally and you all seem to help one another so thought i,d give this ago. My periods stopped after the third fec and by number five i was having really bad flushes at my 6 weeks end of treatment check was told because of my age (40) that this was now probably the menapause and that was that but at the beginning of August my flushes which were really bad (20-30 aday) just stopped all of a sudden, i also had some low stomach ache and thought oh my periods must just be coming back, since then nothing other than a bit of spotting but still no flushes, i went to doc,s just over a week ago and she examined me and said everything looked healthy, took a blood test for hormone levels and told me to keep a two week diary for the spotting and come back for blood results during app the words specialist, biopsy, last smear test etc and i,m just now worried sick i,m not sure i can cope with all this again and surely i can,t be unlucky eghough to have another cancer so soon after this one, unless there thinking secondaries but i didn,t think you got secondaries there, i just thought i was getting my periods back, if anyone can shed some light on this or help in any way i would be so grateful. Love to you all, Char x",

      "Content": "Hi Alison, I was diagnosed with TNBC i Sep 2009, stage 2, grade 3, no nodes. I had 6 cycles of fec chemo and 15 sessions of radio. I only had the sentinal node removed so i am afraid i can't help with the exercises you need to be doing but hopefully other ladies on here will. I do have experience with bad reaction to the steroids, on my first chemo i had the usual dose with the chemo and the little white tablets to take for the next three days at home by the sat night i was practically climbing the walls, i was having irrational thoughts and excrutiating pain in my neck and shoulders where i could not relax eventually in the early hours i had a severe anxiety attack and was taken into hospital, they ran some tests and deceided i was having steroid physcosis which can sometimes happen. On the remainder of my chemo's i had a reduced amount of steroids with the chemo and no tablets at home and to help with the sickness i had the drug emend which is one tablet before chemo and one tablet for the next two days, which helped i did have further panic attacks and problems with my neck and shoulders but it was much more manageable. The steroids are given to help with allergic reactions aswell as reducing sickness but as you have had two chemosÂ  they may say it would be ok, the steroids also help with inflammation so they gave me omeprazole for this also. I hope this helps a little bit and things are easier next time. Lots of love Char. xxxx",

      "Content": "Hi Helen, Since my treatment ended in May last year it took a good few months to regain my strength but now 10 months on i am feeling pretty much back to normal, i have had a couple of scares but thankfully both have been ok, I'm sorry i can't help you with your type of chemo but hopefully someone will come along who knows a bit more. As you know because we are not receptive to hormones our treatment is a bit limited and when the chemo and radio is done that's pretty much it, for me i have a meeting once a year with my consultant and then one with my oncologist and a yearly mammogram but because of my two scares i haven't had much time away from it really, i'm hoping now i will get a bit of a reprieve and try and get back to normality. Do you have access to a breast care nurse where you are? i find mine invaluable. Take care, love Char xxx",

Glad to hear you managed to see the English speaking nurse, as long as you are coping with the sickness the lack of steroids will be a bonus ( they made me totally nuts). Be careful with other online sites, i now only use this one and there is another one \"breast cancer care\", in the beginning it's quite tempting to keep looking at lots of different information, put all your energy into your treatment it will help you so much more. I only live about an hours drive away from Cardiff, so who knows we could be doing our xmas shopping togeather at the end of the year. Take care of yourself, Lots of love Char xxxx",

I too had exactly the same problem when the flushing kicked in, i left it a very long and just assumed i had to put up with it, when it got so bad i could hardly sit down so i went to my gp who told me offÂ  for not seeing her sooner, because i was triple negative she said it was perfectly safe to use a vaginal suppository called vagifem which you have one a night for two weeks and then just twice a week there after, i was a bit dubious so did speak to my BCN beforehand and she said my consultant was quite happy for me to use it, it is a locally applied form of estrogen and so is safe for triple negatives to use and i have to say for quality of life and being able to enjoy a sex life again it is wonderful and for me the right choice, to be menapausel at 40 is no fun, the flushing is still horrendous so being able to alleviate one of the syptoms has helped it be a little more bearable. Don't suffer in silence like i did see your GP or speak to your BCN. Take care, lots of love, Char xxx",

I did mention all this to my consultant and she just said it could be like this for quite a while, she did mention though that if i was having flushing at any one time and bleeding then to mention this to her as this shouldn't happen.
