      "Content": "Hi Emm,                     You must be at the same stage as me I had a right mastectomy and sentinal node biopsy. I have had to have help with things like washing my hair and some housework. My biggest problem is my arm just above the elbow on the inside it is like a painful tingling sensation. Have you had this?  As you have said I have had more movement than expected especially as I am right handed I had my original dressing removed on Wednesday, but the nurse replaced it with another which she gave me more dressings to be able to change. I have a hospital appointment on Tuesday for the results. When is your next appointment   Best wishes Christine  ",

Without mentioning the word lymphoedema she said she could measure up for a compression sleeve. I have decided to wait to see it goes down on its own first. Anyone know if there is an alternative to wearing a compression sleeve. It is a little uncomfortable at times but it is bearable, not a lot of pain   Best wishes Christine  ",

I had to have a lot less treatment than you I just had a mastectomy and SNB without all the chemo and radiotherapy. I had the op in January but i still feel a l pulling from the scar tissue when I do the exercises and numbness in the top of my arm. Did you have any problems like that? Christine xxx",
