To top it off I had in inject myself with white blood cells which I have been doing since Friday but last night they had me in agony. Moan over still in pain. Hope you keep well x",

      "Content": "Hi I as diagnosed end of March and told I would be having op and radiotherapy op being Friday13 th May lol have to laugh. But was always told if I was her2 positive I would need chemo but only 15% were so tried not to think about it. Even went to pre-op on the monday and still waiting on her2 results. On the Wednesday got called in to speak to doctors and told I was her2 positive so would need chemo first. I'm also hormone postive and grade 3. I just think of it as a detour as long as the result is ok in the end it don't matter how you get there. I'm having second chemo today and still feel ok most of the time. I'm 35 with 3 children 14 10 and 20 months. Hope this helps x",
