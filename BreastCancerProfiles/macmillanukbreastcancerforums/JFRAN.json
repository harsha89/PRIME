      "Content": "Hi Rosie, I am 72, finished radiotherapy 5  weeks ago with minimal discomfort though I did wear a silk vest under my bra.  Had a few tiny blisters under my breast 10 days after therapy ended but they healed within 24 hours.  Used aloevera gel which is readily available.  My cancer was on the left side and this is where the late problems can occur with the heart, but not for 10 to 15 years  and at Singleton where I went they teach you to hold your breath while the beam is on to lift the chest wall away from the heart.  As for Letrozole I think because I experienced a full menopause 20 years ago I don't seem to be experiencing hot flushes. My only problem is mild stiffness and I have joined a fitness class to deal with this.  I did however find that Letrozole and radiotherapy at the same time did not suit me as my blood pressure shot up.  Now I am just on Letrozole and Herceptin my BP is back to normal with my usual small dose of antihypertensive medication.  As for bisphosphonates I had my first of six infusions 5 months ago.  It did give me severe shivers for 36 hours but I am told subsequent doses are better tolerated.  I nursed in the 60's and the present day fantastic treatments were beyond our wildest dreams. God bless you",

      "Content": "I had 12 cycles of weekly paclitaxel and found the side-effects pretty mild, mild nausea, mild diarrhoea and moderate heartburn.  When it got to number 8 I found my energy levels had sunk and my mood was a bit down but otherwise it was a whole lot better than a 3-weekly regime I had managed only one cycle of and no filgastim injections.",
