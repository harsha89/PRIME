      "Content": "Hi everybody, Many thanks to you for your useful comments and the support. Please note that the patient is in Iran. So the procedure for assessment is not regulated. There is not committee to decide about treatment, but the doctor acts based on its experience and knowledge. My mum will be receiving Taxotel and Carboplatine (TC) for eight sessions followed by radiotherapy.  However two consultants in the UK suggested to get TCH, TC plus Hecreptin for six sessions followed by hereptin up to a year. The difficulty is that she is very sensitive and too upset to discuss any change in medication. we have informed her doctor in Iran about the views of consultants in the UK, but the doctor has not responded yet. I wonder if starting Herceptin now, at the start of third chemotherapy can still be useful for her. Should we somehow force her to take it? I am confused, don't know how I can help her. Difficult when you live away and just acting based on information/test results, etc. All the best to you guys, giving very useful advice. Ali  ",

      "Content": "Normal 0 false false false EN-GB X-NONE X-NONE MicrosoftInternetExplorer4 My mum is diagnosed with invasive intraductal carcinoma, tumour (2.8cm) and eight nodes have been removed. Surrounding tissue, nodes and bone scan are all clear. She is 65 and healthy. Results of tests are:  HER2 (3+), ER negative, PR negative. She had the first chemotherapy TC (toxoter and carboplatin) four weeks ago. one of the doctors suggests to start Herceptin as well. I wonder what is the chance of reoccurrence in her case, if she refuses to get chemotherapy? How much is the survival rate, or recurrence rate, if she gets TCH, receive Herceptin alone, or doing nothing (stop medication altogether)? I understand the answer may not be definite, but any idea would be of great help. With you all health,",
