      "Content": "Hi was diagnosed with breast cancer in my left breast July 2014, had lumpectomy, chemotherapy and radiotherapy.  I am still having Herceptin Injections and am on Tamoxifen. I have tried hard to look after myself since treatment finished, gentle exercise, resting when needed, I returned to work in May this year, on a phased return, and only work part-time. Since being back to work I have had 2 bladder infections, put down to tamoxifen, and a throat infection.  This Monday I ended up in A & E and was admitted to hospital for 2 days, with infection in my left breast and a very high temperature. The infection so bad couldn't do proper scan, and although they believe it is just an infection they would rule out recurrence of cancer. I have an appointment at the breast clinic next week for further tests. But am worried that the cancer has returned. If not why do I keep getting ill. I just want to get back to normal. Has anyone else suffered with this. Hoping someone out there can help. Helen ",

Can anyone help who has been there, i know i should be pleased as i only have 2 more to go, then radiotherapy, but I'm so tired and feel so ill all the time that not sure i can continue. Can anyone give me ideas to help, looking forward t hearing from anyone",

I am looking into increasing juicing, manukca honey and trying a bit more walking.  Have made an appointment with the dietician to have a chat and will have a good talk with my oncologist before the next lot. Was expecting it to be hard, but with the fec. I felt rubbish for about a week, 13 days in after Herceptin and T, no sign feeling better before the next. Luckily I have a great family and friends who are helping. Good wishes to all who are going through treatment or any form of cancer",
