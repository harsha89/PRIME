      "Content": "Hi York I too am 43, have 2 children (5 and 7) and a great husband. I got my biopsy results dec 11 and was told I had two invasive cancers in my breast, grade 2 and 3. I was offered further tests to determine if lumpectomy was  an option but I opted for a full mastectomy, I wanted it out. I had my op dec 21 and am recovering well. I get my full pathology report and next steps on Thur. I am petrified. The only thing I can say to you is that you are not alone. I cry when I need to and talk, talk, talk to my friends and family. I voice my fears honestly and that takes the sting out a little. I don't think about the big picture, I take each step in this nightmare as it comes, first op, now results and I focus on my children, they keep me up when I feel I am sinking. Sending you lots of positive thoughts. Xxx",

      "Content": "Hi York. Sorry to hear your news, another step forward though, you'll have everything surgical done on 14th.  I was all worked up for my results today to be told that they weren't back due to Xmas hols. I have to wait now until Tuesday.  I've had my mastectomy but would need to go back in for more surgery if my nodes are positive. Keep telling yourself it's treatable, it is. Xxx",

      "Content": "Hi Cath I had a mastectomy on 21st 12th was was told the results would be back on 31st. The wait was excruciating and when we went into the appt, we were told that due to holidays, the pathologist had not got round to my case!! So another weekend passed and we finally got the results back on 5th Jan. it's horrible I know, but knowing that the surgery had removed the tumors really helped me get through those weeks. Take one day at a time. Hugs Diane ",
