    "Content": "I found a lump in upper right breast about 3 weeks ago, I took the wait and see approach as I thought it might be my cycle. It was still there on Thursday so I made an appointment with my G.P on Friday morning who could feel the lump and so he checked my lymph nodes, which he said felt fine. He has revered me to the breast clinic, which I go to on the 8th March. I am a bit concerned as have had a breast lump a couple of years ago and the G.P said it was just fatty tissue and not to worry about it. I left feeling ok but since then I have become really anxious about it, I am not a very anxious person in general. My husband said he was shocked when I 23rd him and he does not want to talk about it again in il we know what it Is, which I understand but not being able to discuss my concrns is making me want to consult Dr Google. Any suggestions on how to get through the next 11 days will be greatly appreciated x",
