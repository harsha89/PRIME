This was before I went on Tamoxifen but this drug does apparently cause such cysts. Don\u2019t put it with the pain. Speak to your gynae about  it. Good luck F",

      "Content": "Hi everyone I\u2019m currently halfway through 20 sessions of RT. I\u2019ve also been on Tamoxifen for about five weeks. I had a bad reaction to the Wockhardt brand with terrible pelvic pain, but my GP prescribed Buscopan which is a muscle relaxant and that helps a bit. I\u2019ve switched to the Teva brand and that seems to be going better. The only difficulty will be insisting I get this brand in future as so many chemist say they just get what their supplier sends them. I foresee a continuing struggle with this! About R1 and R2 \u2013 A\u2019s this is fairly new I printed off details of these and brought them to the radiographers at my measuring up session. They didn\u2019t know about them but were pleased to get the info and so I\u2019ve been able to use them as my GP agreed to prescribe it. You can go onto the site to find the PIP numbers. If you\u2019re having difficulty let me know and I will put them on this thread. They\u2019re certainly helping me, as my breast is very red and painful. I\u2019m just hoping that the skin holds up for the second half of the sessions. Best wishes to everyone for your treatment. F",

The only amusing part of this was my husband\u2019s horror at the idea of any washing up. When we first got married I ordered a dishwasher but when it arrived he asked why we needed it. I explained that it was to give us more time together (carefully glossing over that I personally hated washing up). His rely was that it was an unreasonable expense, so he sent it back again!

Forgive me for asking but did you also have some of your lymph nodes removed? I also asked about the risk of lymphoedema and was told that this shouldn\u2019t be a problem as my lymph nodes were clear. I agree I have been doing quite a lot of research online and there seems to be an ongoing debate about the width of the margin and the impact it may have on recurrence. I just want to make sure that any risk of recurrence is minimised as much as possible. Thanks again for your very prompt response and very best wishes for your recovery.",

      "Content": "Hello everyone  I just need to share my frustration and unhappiness at the treatment I have received from Boots Chemists. My GP ordered R1 and R2 for my radiotherapy treatment over 10 days ago and despite two visits to my local Boots they still hasn\u2019t arrived. After waiting almost an hour today I established with the help of one of the pharmacy assistants that the products are available but the Accounts department at Boots simply hasn\u2019t paid for them and the supplier won\u2019t release them until they get the payment. The pharmacy assistant was wonderful but it took her over an hour to establish what had happened back at the area office. I am just so upset that I could have been treated in this way when I need these products now urgently for radiotherapy that starts next week. I\u2019ve decided to cancel the order from Boots and go to another chemist, whom I saw today and who assured me he could get these products within two days. This just shows you that large organisations just couldn\u2019t care less about their customers. ",

I was told that my margins were clear although a little close at the front (anteriory), so I was initially pleased with the outcome. Yesterday I had a meeting with the radiologist prior to having radiotherapy and was shocked to hear that the front margin was only 0.5 mm. The guidelines appear to be that a margin of at least 1 mm needs to show clear from cancer tissue. I have been told I will be having a booster week of radiotherapy therapy to address this issue but I\u2019m really concerned that I ought be discussing whether to have a re-excision with my surgeon. I can\u2019t speak to her at the moment as she is on holiday and my breast cancer nurse was really unable to help other than to say I should speak to her. Has anybody had a similar experience?",

I imagine that is why your oncologist has recommended that you take hormone treatment as these tablets can be oestrogen suppressers, which is one of the ways to avoid a recurrence. It will depend on your make up as to which is recommended. I am on Tamoxifen, as I also have osteoporosis and this leeches less bone than some of the others. I should speak to you oncologist about the options.  It also depends on your make up as to what side-effects you get from the recommended dose. People experience different effects at different intensities, so there isn\u2019t a common thread. It\u2019s a question of trial and error to some extent.  Very best of luck with your treatment. F",
