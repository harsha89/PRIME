Femera is made in numerous European countries packaging is identical but all using different filling compounds and that is what your body is reacting to.  Femara UK Novatis is the one I have been taking for the past 5years, my swelling was reduced my joints hurt less and I am able and enjoy going to the gym once again at 70 I am feeling so much healthier after being bedridden from chemo.  Its good to write a diary of all the problems so you don't forget when your with your GP, he must write on the prescription UK Novatis  as many chemists find it difficult to get that specific one. My local Boots have been brilliant. Wishing you all the very best and a healthier 2019 Marie",

      "Content": "Hello Kath  yes its a minefield so many different variations of surgeries and Chemo, I asked the same questions to my surgeon when I tried to hold on to my breast and not have a mastectomy.  My surgeon explained very gently that it all depends how big the breast is, how big the area effected by cancer, how many areas, how large, nodes effected if so how many,.... etc, etc . He convinced me that my treatment was the best for me. My oncologist did the same. Its very confusing, but I learnt to question anything I did not understand.   Reading about peoples experience has helped me to understand what is going to happen next and how I can make it less daunting. Regarding Steriods I was advised to take them early in the day as a if you take them late in the day they keep you awake.  I am also having my first T on Tuesday!!!! Take care and all the very best Marie-Francoise  ",

Give yourself time to get used to the change........... Wear clothes that makes you feel comfortable even if you have to treat yourself to something new.........If you have someone close ask is it noticeable and they will tell you and soon it will feel like the question \"Does my bum look big in this?\" just joking!!!! You do not say how long ago was the surgery and if you had to have chemo......My surgeon advised me not to swim in a swimming pool as you are very susceptible to infections until your immune system is back to normal and the scar completely healed....I really miss my aqua class. But as so many of us have learnt ....... we are warriors with battle scars .....be proud and your children will be soooooo proud of you, have fun and enjoy the summer  holidays with them.  Big gentle hug from Marie-Francoise",

Unfortunately you have to really listen to your body and and learn \"pain management\" or you will take soooo much longer to recover and undo what the surgeons have done. My instructions when I was discharged after surgery: When tired rest and I mean rest. Do not wait till your exhausted!!! Exercise  (All in the ward had to greet our surgeon with a salute of putting our hand behind our head)  it made us smile to see him so happy that we could do it and gave us a sense we are getting better.    It also prevents fluid build up which is very painful. Drink plenty of water. Take our painkillers/medication regular  (pain management) as Louise says no medals for pain. (I know I didn't get any) Never carry anything heavy, (When I do !  I suffer afterwards) I am now an online shopper.  No hoovering! house stays clean if your resting. Family and friends love to do it, and they always clear up when in the house. I have been told that they feel so much better that they can help and see you getting stronger. If you just take it easy in the first weeks,    especially,     your healing begins to speed up and you will have less complications. We all have learnt from others and our own experiences. So Emma crunchie time (I like that Louise) Take care  Marie-Francoise",

Ok to use the cold cap or not, I am 65 and was encouraged like you by my oncologist and the nurses on my 1st chemo and I am so happy I did. It wasn't easy and the 1st 15 mins was painful so I would take a paracetamol before putting the cap on, my children helped me through it by trying to make me laugh, and holding my hand. I found hair every morning on my pillow and would just roll it up with a sticky roller.  Also I washed my hair with a chemical free shampoo once a week with cool water (as cool as you can bear it) I found if my head got warm then the hair fell out. I have finished my FEC&T with hair if a little thin, and 4weeks later I have new hair growing that now makes my hair looks thicker. If your hair is long it may be better to cut it shorter. There were a few ladies who also use the cold cap and one lady has lots of hair although she says she has thinned out so it also depends on how thick your hair is to start with. The hospital Charing Cross use Digital a newer machine which brings the temp to  5º , some older machines make it a lot lower so that is something to consider. I had it on 30mins before chemo and 1 1/2 hr after but it will all depend on the machine. I wanted to give up also but now i'm glad I continued its not pleasant but its doable. I'm giving you a gentle hug and whatever you decide all the very best with your chemo. Marie-Francoise",

If you are an active person your arm is not the place to fit it as the experience your having is very usual . Perhaps you need a Central line (I think they are called ) inserted just below the collar bone it leaves a tiny scar if you wear low cut dresses but it was fairly normal place at my chemo dept. I had one put just under my bra definitely not a good place as a bra would hurt just by touching it. 11 more  chemo so it\u2019s worth considering where would it be less troublesome for you and I hope they listen and put it there.

I had a mastectomy + re-constructive surgery  on the 2nd December had to reschedule 18th Dec booked flight to 30th December, as I had a build up of fluid which my surgeon aspirated out but soon had another build up.  My Oncologist advised me that if you continually aspirate your lymphatic system it does not learn to operate, as it should!!! \"Get plenty of rest with a pillow under your arm pit, also keep the pillow under your arm on car journeys, drink gallons of water, gently massage the effected breast in a circular motion going upwards towards the neck. \" (I found the instructions on YouTube.) It worked and flew to Australia, again with a pillow under my armpit! I will be honest I travelled with my daughter who made sure I didn\u2019t carry anything. Three weeks later returned nervously home on my own!!!! All went well and passengers sitting next to me couldn\u2019t have been kinder once I explained why I could not climb over them to get to the aisle. I made sure I took the painkillers (paracetamol) at regular intervals with food, during the flight. I went for a walk up and down the aisle to prevent thrombosis + also wore flight socks. I did not have the same for my arm so I can't  comment.  I also kept that arm close to my body and tried not to use it. I really hope this helps because the holiday really helped with my recovery and strong enough for Chemo, which started a few days after my return.   All the very best  and have a wonderful holiday Marie-Francoise",

Keep taking your anti sickness tablets....I didn't and was so sick was walking around with a bowl! not nice soon l learnt my lesson.  Have cream crackers at hand and bland children's food is good. Make a game of putting toys away they soon learn its makes mummy sooooo happy. Rest whenever you can difficult with children but I am sure they love a little down time with mummy . Accept help Always and learn to ask even unloading dishwasher or washing up they may not do it your way but its done! I found/find that difficult but getting better. Never hoover!!!

Never care heavy items including little children love lots of gentle cuddles and it's soooooo good for you. Chemo is your protecter and friend so that you have an amazing future. YesterdayI  had  my first Herzeptin no problem. Today  T part of the FEC&T I have finished FEC during which I learnt what my body  didn't like about the chemo and adjusted my life style  but all was surprisingly ok. Everyone is so different but reading different experiences an tips has made my chemo a lot easier to cope with and I hope it continues. Today I am celebrating I am over 66% of the treatment. You are down one yehhhh. you deserve a big cuddle. Listen to your body and do what you are comfortable with and I hope you have a pain free time with your Chemo wishing you all the very best.

I had booked to visit my daughter before I was diagnosed. On holiday I continued to rest, slowly recover and I had a great time. Then sadly flew back home on my own...... but I was all the stronger for the chemo.   It was truly the best thing I could have done, so I am wishing you the very best..... you've done the anger put it behind you...... you need all the positivity ahead of you. Sending you a great big gentle hug to you all xxx",

On reading your letter these are a few things perhaps that may help. On your next appointment record your consultation ask your surgeon first, mine was so happy I did because like you I couldn't remember what was said on my first appointment, My family and I were able to listen to it piece by piece and understand better the diagnosis and proposed treatment. Like you I am HER2+ so my chemo was FEC&T: 3 x FEC .....it was ok felt sick initially but my assigned Breast Care Nurse soon gave me drugs to take care of that. 3 x T (docetaxel also called Taxotere ®) + 3 xHerceptin  via a picc line (which your surgeon will have his special place to put it mine was put under my bra some people have it there arm or chest.) Now that my FEC&T is complete I have 5 x Herceptin via an injection in the top of my leg into fat area and it doesn't hurt and I am not having side effects fantastic. I few more and then that milestone is reached. I used a cold cap throughout it adds on a few hrs extra for each chemo but I kept a lot of my hair, it does get thinner but if you have thick hair its not noticeable. I finished 2mnths ago chemo and have short but a full head.  Use dark nail varnish as some chemo reacts with light and damages your nails \"Mavala\" have fantastic advice sheet and I used their products which is for cancer patients and it worked. My daughter and I did each others nails. You will get tired so its fantastic that your family are so supportive as you will need them and it helps them to be part of you getting better.  Your daughter can help by washing your hair as its difficult after you have surgery .  Ask your son for help so he feels part of your recovery even if its doing his homework near you to keep you company when your resting. My son used to work on his laptop near me while I rested I found it a tremendous comfort. As a mother we take care of our family  unfortunately this is the time you will on occasion have to listen to your body and accept the care from your family. Wishing you all the very best. A huge big gentle hug, wishing you and your family lots of courage and strength. Love Marie-Francoise",

      "Content": "Hi Mel, just read your post you seem to have got a lot stronger since post surgery well done. Its a tough road to walk alone. You are about to start FEC chemo have you been offered the cold cap? If you are it might be something to consider as I went through it and now post chemo FEC&T have a nice little cap of hair and my wig has been worn twice in a vain attempt to take it out, it looked sad sitting in the box). There are a few points that will help with the process: Take painkillers before starting it eliminates headaches that some people get for the first 20mins. Wash hair with very chemical free shampoo (rosemary shampoo  by loreal is great as it stimulates  hair growth) Wash hair in as cool water .... as you can bear,  ok in summer. Avoid getting your head hot. It does add extra time to the chemo session. (It will depend on which machines your hospital use) Looking back it was a hassle but Im so happy my children encouraged me. Word of warning some hair does fall out so don't panic or get upset (like I did) but if you have thick hair your fine.  My hair was very fine. Whatever you decide big gentle hug and all the best with FEC. Marie-Francoise",

I reacted badly so my GP prescribed Norvatis Uk Femara as he put it it\u2019s cheaper to have you well. So talk to your GP keep a diary of any side effects, and hopefully he will be as understanding or ask you chemist to order the brand that your body can tolerate.  Im afraid it\u2019s a learning curve to what each individual can cope with but you have done so well had to tolerate with so much just be strong and ask for what you feel is good for you  I really wish you the very best of health.",

And say I need this brand doctor and to the pharmacist \u201cyou haven\u2019t got it in stock would you mind ordering this brand and let me know when it comes in\u201d trust me they usually get it in the next day, if they can\u2019t go to another chemist, my chemist and I hug each other as she sees how much I\u2019ve improved, my son noticed and pointed out they see so many who don\u2019t do so well it must be nice for them to see good results.  So everyone be strong and make a chemist smile  big gentle hugs  mf",

      "Content": "Hello Chaz, I think Jude has written exactly what I was going to, I have had similar diagnosis as Jude, So lets get through the lumpectomy first part surgeon has to make sure they have a lovely clear margin all round lump they are pretty good about that. Before you go in for surgery they put a blue dye into the lymph path near were effected area and that helps the surgeon, they took three nodes out of mine.....node 1 had little cancer cell....node 2 had some pre cancer cells......node 3 was clear yehhhhh.  Mine once removed were tested imiddiately, and he didn\u2019t remove any more. I wish you all nodes nice and clear. Mine were tested immediately to see if the surgeon needed to remove more. As he said last one looked clear so rest remain. You will get an absolute result a week later after they go to the labs for thorough check. You have a scar not too big and little drain which will be removed usually before leaving hospital but that depends how long you stay in. Now this is the best advice I was given: Exercise\u2026gently \u2026.a little and often .... Lift effected arm to put behind your head that was our salute to our surgeon \u2026.all his patience had to do this, this made your lymphatic system work again or your breast swell not nice and oh very painful, but if you get that just gently massage upwards towards the collar bone. I learnt a lot from YouTube and the Macmillan leaflets. Bras to buy I bought expensive post surgical bra oh boy very uncomfortable!!!! Easy for the surgeon to put on though.  But after a few days it caused blisters so was immediately put on antibiotics.  On advice by experienced patient was told get M&S tee shirt soft bra that the stitching is so smooth, I stepped into mine and pulled them upwards they are £12 for two, beige, white and black, not exciting colours so I ordered some on line but the stitching hurt!!!! I wear mine 24/7 and I am a size 38B, can\u2019t wait to wear pretty ones.  But they have been comfortable and easy for my chemo admin as my pic line is under my breast. Now next part chemo I was reluctant to go through chemo as I had been given all clear. Basically it gives you a higher percentage of not getting it again or zapping the  nasty odd cell has gone for a walk about to do damage elsewhere! Your surgeon and oncologist will talk to you through it and which one is the best for you. they can only do this accurately after your removed lump and nodes have been analyzed but you will get lots of support and statistics.   I think that is enough for now, remember you are unique and your treatment will be especially for you, \u2026..aftereffects \u2026. your body will let you know always listen to it .\u2026 remember pain management you get no medals for pain \u2026.there are many of us who are happy to help.   Wishing you all the very best and hope it\u2019s a tiny little lump. Get plenty of rest\u2026. no lifting anything \u2026\u2026.say yes to ALL help. It will soon be over. Thinking of you and let me know how you get on. Marie-Francoise.  ",

They changed my letrozole prescription to Femara after I was so ill with the generic tablet I tried many, but I swelled could barely move and had upset stomach.  Each time I pick up my prescription from Boots who specially order it for me and then text me.  I say a BIG thank you   (I\u2019ve had chemists refuse the prescription) I know I\u2019ve done very well but that is all down to my health team and in return I enjoy and make the most of every great day I have.  I wish all my fellow BC on letrozole the very best holidays and support from everyone around them.",
