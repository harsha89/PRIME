I don't hear from mine unless I leave at least 1 or 2 messages on her answer phone! I didn't even get a call following my mastectomy, nor a promised visit from her when I was on the ward.  I've given up with her now and just don't rely on her at all. It's a shame as I would at times have really benefited from talking to her. The problem is I don't really feel I can complain as I'm sure she's just really busy and probably has lots of ladies in a worse position than me.",

      "Content": "I had my second FEC on Wednesday and managed a meal out with friends tonight and none of them could believe how well I look ! My first FEC I was sick and nauseous for 24 hours or so, a bit woozy for a couple of days and a bit tired for a few days after that. Now I've had my second I'm amazed that I feel pretty much OK. I am taking the steroids and anti sickness drugs religiously and I also took some homeopathic remedies on the day of my chemo this time. From reading about other experiences on here it seems we all handle it completely differently and so far I seem to be one of the lucky ones. I was absolutely dreading chemo but it is doable and I really hope your experience isn't too bad. I did use the cold cap for the first one but didn't for the second as my hair was falling out in handfuls. But I still have enough hair to go out this evening without a scarf or wig though it is falling fast so don't think I'll have much by the end of the weekend. The worst bit was waiting for it to happen but once it starts you kind of have to embrace it and it does mean the bleaching process is working! Good luck, Jane x",

      "Content": "Having a fed up day today after feeling so positive for some time. I had my WLE on 8th May and have since had to go back for re-excision twice. I was supposed to have started chemo by now but everything has been delayed whilst I still need surgery. I'm fed up with waiting for dressings to come off, looking after my scars with Bio-oil to help them heal, only to have it all opened up again!! I now have to wait 3 weeks for the results of the last surgery which was done last Thursday and then have been told I will be referred to oncology even if they need to do more surgery afterwards. So the earliest my chemo will start is the end of July. Sometimes wish they'd just done a mastectomy in the first place! I'm scared that whilst all this is going on and I'm not having chemo, nasty little cancer cells could be lurking in my system somewhere and doing harm. I just hate what this stupid disease does to your life, turns it upside down and inside out - all my plans for this year have gone out of the window and I'm feeling really frustrated!!  All of this has been happening against a background of a daughter doing A levels and a son doing GCSEs. I feel like I'm having to hold it all together for everyone else when I just want to curl up in a corner and feel sorry for myself. I have one more day of kids exams before I can book in my nervous breakdown!! Need some sanity back in my life!",

My surgeon told me that if the lymph node biopsy is negative there is a very good chance the rest of the lymph nodes are fine too.  Every hospital seems to do things differently but yours are clearly on the ball and getting on with it. However hard it may be trust that you are in safe hands who have seen this many times before and remember this is so treatable.  I had a lumpectomy in May with more surgery last week to get better margins. I feel absolutely fine now. My lymph nodes were clear. I will be having chemo and radiotherapy as I'm 45 and my tumour was grade 3 - this is all to prevent it coming back. Depending on your age and the grade of tumour you may have similar.  I too felt terrified only a month ago but I can honestly say I feel much more in control now thanks to my hospital, friends, family and the support I get on here.

I promise things will get better when you know exactly what your treatment plan is. Well done to your hospital for getting on with your surgery so quickly!  You will probably also feel much better once the lump is out. I know I did. It's a psychological thing of not having that nasty cancer inside you any more. Have you been told yet whether they are checking your lymph nodes in surgery ie sentinel node biopsy, or what follow up treatment you are likely to have? Just try and take one day at a time at the moment Anne be kind to yourself. I too have a wealth of support from friends and family but it really helps to talk to people on here who completely understand what you're talking about. Take care Jane xxx",

      "Content": "Oh Lizz this is terrible! I've just read this horrendous article and it's so far from the truth! The Guardian are really irresponsible for publishing such a scaremongering tale. I had chemo 2 years ago and it was nothing like as bad as this awful woman is saying. She says that fasting helped her - but I ate what I liked when I liked and still managed to maintain a fairly normal lifestyle. I still went out for meals, I still saw friends for coffee and lunch, I still went for a walk. There were days when I felt quite poo but they were less often than the better days. By the end of it I was pretty exhausted and it did take quite a few months to feel completely normal again.  My advice would be to go with the flow,eat what you like and do as much as you feel able to do. It isn't a nice experience but it isn't horrendous honestly.  I tried the cold cap for my first cycle and my hair did start to fall out slowly. I decided that it was fairly inevitable that I would lose it and I didn't use the cold cap again. I absolutely dreaded losing my hair but do you know what? It was all right when it happened. Get yourself booked onto a Look Good, Feel Better course somewhere and you can get lots of make up tips and bandana tips and meet women in the same position as you - it will really help I promise! As for fasting - don't bother! I pretty much lived on fruit pastilles by the end as they were one of the only things that had a taste! I went off anything that had a strong flavour and by the last chemo survived on jacket potatoes and bread!  Before my chemo started I thought that I would probably be feeling terrible for 4 months solid. I was sick after my first chemo for one evening, and after my third chemo for one evening. I wasn't sick at all the rest of the time. I did lose my ability to taste which was probably the worst thing and I did feel nauseous at times, particularly if someone was cooking. I did lose my eyebrows and eyelashes, but they came back pretty quickly. I lost 95% of my hair but it's come back lovely and curly :) My finger nails were rubbish for about 18 months but have now recovered.  When people say it's doable it actually is. There are some days worse than others, and you may be unlucky and feel really crap sometimes - but you won't feel really crap all of the time. I know some ladies here will have had more difficult experiences than me and I was very, very lucky - but please don't assume from reading this article that it is like death without dying, because it just isn't.  Good luck and keep positive - all the time chemo is 'poisoning' you it's killing that damned cancer!!

      "Content": "Hello your treatment sounds very similar to mine. I'm nearly at the end of my chemo after a lumpectomy and 2 re-excisions. I expect you will be having FEC-T chemo which is normally 3 x FEC and 3 x docetaxel. My hospital wanted to wait 6 weeks from surgery to starting chemo but every hospital seems to be different. I'm sure they will give you lots of information about likely side effects. Have a think about using the cold cap if it's offered to try and keep your hair. I used it the first time but lost lots of hair anyway so didn't use it again. It will extend the length of time you're having your chemo administered but only by a couple of hours. I didn't find it at all  painful but some people do. With regards to a line being put in they are probably referring to a PICC line. This goes into your upper arm and is a very simple procedure done with a local anaesthetic and takes about 20 minutes. You do have an x ray afterwards to make sure it's in the right place. I would strongly recommend you have this as the other option is to have a cannula put in each time. Blood can also be taken from the PICC line and you will have to have a blood test before each chemo to make sure your levels are ok. I didn't have a PICC line until after my 3rd chemo and I really regret it as the FEC chemo can damage your veins and I now have sore painful arms which I've been told won't get better for a few months. Since having the PICC line chemo sessions have been a breeze! I hope this helps but very happy to answer other questions. Take a pen and paper with you and write down everything!  Don't forget they do this every day so I'm sure will provide you with everything you need to know. One other thing is if you think you will wear a wig if you lose your hair then it's best to sort it before chemo start . I went to a local salon who specialise in wigs and chose one that closely matched my style and colour. I didn't have to commit to anything but they noted down the one I chose so that even my hair started to go I just phoned them up and ordered it.  Good luck with everything Jane x",

I found how tired I was after each one varied quite a lot. FEC 3 I sailed through but the others were tougher.   My advice would be to listen to your body and try not to do too much for the next week or so. Your white cells are on a downward trend at the moment so you are going to feel tired. Be kind to yourself and, if you can, let others do the running around for you.   Jane xx  ",

It's so hard though isn't it because your head is telling you to do things but your body says no!!  The thing is everyone reacts differently to chemo so no one can really tell you how you're going to feel. It's really helpful to keep a diary though of how you are day to day as you will forget. Then fire your second chemo you'll have slightly more idea of what to exist and what did and didn't work for you. I just used to jot down what medication I'd taken and a quick note of how I felt. What worked for me is doing anything important in the morning then feet up in the afternoon.  I am also a strong believer in not giving in to anything as it can make you feel worse, so a good positive attitude will get you a long way!

Anyway they got gradually stronger and stronger and more frequent but I saw a homeopath who recommended sepia. The day after I started taking it they stopped but then gradually came back but not to the extent they were so now I'm having less and they're not as severe. I know sepia doesn't work for everyone and Sage has also been suggested to me. The other thing my BCN nurse suggested was acupuncture which I will try if the sepia stops working.

They said they could arrange for me to go down there and have a chat with the team to see what's involved. It does sound like a good option for me particularly as I have teenage children who don't need me to run round after them so recovery isn't really such a problem.  I'm a bit shell shocked being in this position as after my diagnosis on 1st April I had a WLE on 8th May, and have had two further re-excisions but the margins aren't good enough still. I didn't think for a second I'd be having a mastectomy and then suddenly here I am having to make decisions about reconstruction!! I'm going to be having my chemo first starting in a couple of weeks and will now skip the radiotherapy stage and move straight to a mastectomy/reconstructions 4-6 weeks after chemo finishes. This is a b****y scary rollercoaster we're all on here and you just don't see the big drops coming at you!!  My consultant said that they offer a buddy system so whichever options I choose or want to explore they will introduce me to someone who has been through the same so they can give me the full picture warts and all. But I kind of feel I need more than just one person to tell me how it is and so I'm hoping the lovely ladies on here may be able to oblige! Thanks all Jane x ",

I just pinched a nice roll of tummy fat :) put the needle in at a nice flat angle and I'm sure it will be fine. I'm on my second round of tax and I was advised first time to do the injection at night so I would sleep through the pain. Big mistake as it really kept me awake! So this time I'm doing them in the morning but am still getting quite a lot of pain at night so taking paracetamol every 4 hours and nurofen in between as suggested by the hospital.  Both the chemo and the injection can cause pain and I'm not sure now which is causing mine! My pain started on day 3 and and lasted 4 or 5 days.",

      "Content": "Lee, I was ER negative and they didn't seem too bothered that PR was highish!  By my calculations if you started chemo now and it was the usual FEC-T x 6 sessions then you'd be all done mid September if that helps at all. You should be feeling ok by the time your grandchild is born and what a fantastically positive thing to aim for. I went to Center Parcs for 4 days a month after chemo ended and, whilst I was tired and bald, I had a great time.  I know it seems daunting, I was absolutely terrified, but it honestly wasn't as bad as I thought. The thing is you tend to only hear the negative stories about chemo but there are a whole lot of people who only have minor issues during chemo. I had lots of side effects but they were fairly short lived. For instance I thought I would be sick from the day I started to the day I finished, but actually I was sick only twice after chemo and each time just on the day it was administered. My taste buds were shot to pieces, I lost all my hair, I've since lost all my toe nails but I also went out to meet friends lots for coffee, meals out, had a camping weekend with friends, went to the cinema and visited my daughter at uni. So, what I'm saying is it can be ok! I think you're right it can sometimes take a few days to get your head around each step but you will get to a decision in your own time.  Jane xx",

My daughter is just finishing her degree and I know how stressful that in itself is but to be dumped with this must be horrid for you.  So, I had a core biopsy and like you I wasn't given any warning. I had an ultrasound and then they thought a biopsy was a good idea. To be honest it was absolutely fine...I know the other reply you've had says it's a bit like dental pain in terms of degrees of pain and that probably is about right. It really isn't too bad at all. And of course it is essential to make sure you get correctly diagnosed, and I truly hope this is nothing to worry about.  I know exactly what you mean about feeling you have a bomb in your chest - we've all experienced that horrible horrible feeling and you know of course that once you've had the biopsy you'll find out for sure one way or another. So a little pain for a lot of gain x I would suggest you take someone along with you. Do you have a good friend you can take? Are you living near to family that could come along with you? I just think it's nice to have someone there to listen to what's being said and whose hand you can squeeze when you need to. Do keep us posted on how you get on. Hopefully you won't have to wait too long for any results. You're the same age as my daughter and my heart absolutely goes out to you. Take care of yourself over the next few days.

This would indicate an environmental reason and diet is the obvious one. I have reduced dairy but not cut it out completely. Jane Plant also recommends cutting out all animal fat so basically is suggesting a vegan diet. But I've decided to reduce dairy to virtually nothing, eat eggs occasionally, fish occasionally and meat rarely and then only chicken. I just felt I needed control in a situation where I have no control. But the best but has been that I lost a stone immediately and my weight has stayed completely stable through five cycles of chemo. I also immediately felt so much better in myself with bags more energy and no more bloating which I'd always suffered from. So I say there's no harm in trying as long as you eat properly and healthily and get all the nutrients you need. I have rice or coconut milk which contain virtually the same amount of calcium as cow's milk. My skin is better than it's ever been and my hair, before I lost it, was in tip top condition.  We all just have to do what we can in this horrible situation we find ourselves in. Jane",

Anyway, after much shopping both by foot and online I ended up buying something really nice from Boux Avenue which wasn't designed for mastectomies  but did allow me to pop my prosthesis in without it falling out. However, during the photo shoot the lovely photographer did have to do a little bit of tucking in here and there! I haven't had the photos back yet but it was such a fun experience, and very liberating. Jane xx",

But my periods then became regular for about a year and then suddenly stopped again. I now have one every 3 or 4 months and a blood test showed I was peri- menopausal so it looks like I'll be doing the menopause all over again.  My advice, get it checked out but I don't think it's that unusual.

I'm 48 and fairly active and have found the prosthesis a bit of a pain. Day to day it's ok but it was very annoying trying to find pretty underwear with delicate straps as all mastectomy bras that I could find that hold a prosthesis in place are not very attractive and they did restrict what clothes I could wear. For example wearing strappy tops became a bit of a no no. I also found it difficult when wearing a sports bra and choosing holiday swimwear. I did buy an additional prosthesis for my holiday which was slightly lighter and sat well in a swimsuit..  I think on balance if I had been given an option I may have gone for a double mastectomy. It's been a pain living with two very different size breasts for 18 months. I hope this may help your decision making and I hope your consultant lets you have what you want. I had a small fight with my consultant over wanting to go smaller as she kept telling me that my F/G breasts were right for my build - however now I'm around a D I'm much happier and they look great!

I couldn't bear the slow torture of watching it disappearing daily. The chemo nurse said to me that the way it was going I was going to lose the lot, and the cold cap might just delay the inevitable. So I decided no cold cap and just embrace baldness.

I've takes to my oncologist about it and they don't think it's down to herceptin but it's because I'm in menopause (I'm 46 and chemo started my menopause). There was a thread on here a while ago about this very subject so you might want to do a search. My hospital said that they had two women who were having aching joints and they swapped them back to IV from injection and the side effects went away. But when I asked if I could do this they told me they thought it was just a coincidence that these ladies got better!!! I've seen my GP this week who said that aching joints can be caused by menopause but that tends to be the small joints like fingers and toes whereas mine is mainly knees, hips and elbows. She didn't think it was menopause. I'm not sure I've got the energy to fight the hospital over this even though the  herceptin info leaflet quite clearly states that more than 1 in 10 people will get aching joints.  I'm taking glucosamine and also walking every day and I have to say that things have improved a little bit. My biggest issue is night time or if I sit down for too long. Does this sound like the sort of thing you're getting? Jane x",

But you are going to have days when you feel completely rubbish and want to crawl under the duvet and like others have said you should let yourself do this sometimes. I'm sure that with such a young child you feel that you have to try and be normal but do take advantage of as much childcare as you can as you need time for you to help you stay strong.  Husbands are funny beasts. I'm not two years post diagnosis but have just had my symmetry surgery :) My husband is still unsympathetic to it - he was great for 48 hours but the novelty has now worn off and he's a bit fed up caring for me. You would have thought after 6 lots of surgery he'd know what to by now lol!! My strategy is to call on friends when I'm feeling really wobbly and have a good chat and cry with them - it really helps. One thing I found really helpful was to write a sort of blog on my Facebook so that I could tell people all at one what was going on. This meant when I was having a crap day I could post from the safety of my laptop and not actually have to phone anyone - I always found someone would come and rescue me on those days.  Keep posting here too, this forum has been invaluable to me and the ladies (and gents) here are an absolutely fabulous resource.

I'm assuming you're having it by injection?  I suffered horrid body aches all the way through my course of 18 injections and was told it was an after effect of chemo like you. But I'm absolutely convinced it wasn't as, no sooner had I finished the course, the body aches went away within a few short weeks. I also started to get a localised reaction at the injection site which got progressively worse over the first few injections and was helped by taking antihistamine prior to and for a day after the injection.  I wasn't aware of feeling weird and spaced out until I stopped having the injections and then suddenly realised what it was like to feel normal again. I had herceptin in 2014/15 and at that time my hospital had just changed over from doing it by IV to doing it by injection. They dismissed my concerns but my BCN did say that one woman who had terrible body aches asked to have it by IV instead of injection and all her pains went away. They didn't give me that option unfortunately. If you google it then anecdotally these side effects seem to happen but I wonder if, because the injections are quite new, there hasn't been enough of a history to prove it.  I'm afraid I can't offer a solution but I hope knowing that you're not alone might make you feel a bit better.

It sounds like you haven't been given an awful lot of information and maybe if you speak to the breast cancer nurse at your hospital they may be able to give you more detail? Or phone the Macmillan nurses (number on this site). I have the same diagnosis as you...grade 3 ductal invasive cancer. This site gives you very good factual information about what that actually means, but the main thing is try not to panic. I have come through the panic stage as some days you believe the cancer is just going to spread but the reality is that even a grade 3 cancer will have been there for months and not weeks, it doesn't develop that fast. It is very treatable but the treatment is quite long winded. I have my surgery booked for 8th May and then will have chemotherapy and radiotherapy like you. It seems like an enormous hill to climb and I am trying to just take one day at a time. What I have been told is that I should have 3 weeks off work after the op and for the first 2 weeks not to drive or do any lifting. Basically making a sandwich is fine but not to lift any saucepans, full kettles etc. After two weeks I should start to do a few things but only do what I am able to do. If you have friends or family around you that can help then I would definitely take advantage of that. I didn't have an infection afer the biopsies but did get a weird stingy tingly feeling for ages and I was told that this was quite normal. I'm sure the antibiotics will kick in but if you're worried phone the hospital or your GP. I have asked all sorts of silly questions of my breast cancer nurse and she has been wonderful. They do understand how frightening this experience can be. Keep in touch on here as I have found it absolutely invaluable. No question is a silly question and everyone here does know what you're going through....we are all going through it or have gone through it. Sending you a big hug Jane xx",

I had the same diagnosis as you back in April - HER positive and grade 3. I'm pretty sure the 3 they've told you is grade as I was told they can't tell the stage until after surgery and lab reports are done. I had surgery first and started my chemo yesterday, and like you will be having herceptin. You may find you can squeeze in a holiday as I can't imagine a week will make any difference and to be honest it'll probably do you the world of good! Talk to the hospital and see what they say. Your cancer won't be going anywhere within a few days so try not to worry. I tried the cold cap yesterday as I thought I may as well give it a go. It was fine and not painful at all. I did have my haircut really short so they it wouldn't be too traumatic if it starts to call out. I have two children (18 and 16) and I think certainly with your daughter of 14 honesty is the best policy. I've given my kids all the facts but have shared them the sometimes very negative emotions I feel. We have a laugh about me maybe missing my hair and my daughter came wig shopping with me and we had such a giggle. She will hear so many things from her friends but all you can do is reassure her. I am making sure I tell my kids exactly what's happening as if I hold something back and they hear about it later they won't trust me. If your son doesn't seem to be reacting I wouldn't worry too much. I'm sure when things actually start to happen he will ask questions and then you can talk about it. My son only really asks me when something is actually happening otherwise his life just goes on which is exactly what I hoped. I do think the worst part is where you are now, before your treatment starts. But honestly you will start to feel better once you're on the journey and it sounds like you already have a great support network. Good luck with the MRI and do keep us posted. Jane xx",

      "Content": "So sorry you find yourself here and I know you will get so much support from all the ladies who are also here with you. I was frantic with worry after my diagnosis but once I got talking here I realized I wasn't alone with this horrible disease, bit in fact in very good company. Everyone says you will feel better when you get your treatment plan sorted and it's absolutely true. I felt that I had lost all control of my future and, for me, getting some control back was vitally important. So I read up on a few things and decided I would radically change my diet to be dairy free as I had read lots about animal fats and hormonal cancer.... But then to find that I lost a stone and felt so much better than I had in years was an added and very welcome bonus. I'm 46 so am one of the younger ones here and I have two teenagers. My diagnosis was in March and I am mid chemo. I can honestly say that none of the treatment has been as bad as I expected but I'm sure having seen your mum and grandmother go through this you have a very good idea of what to expect. Maybe you also need to think about gene testing particularly if you have daughters? The best advice I can give you is take each day as it comes and try not to worry about the future; gather your friends/family around you and use them as your safety net. I culled my Facebook friends after my diagnosis and just kept the true friends and I update regularly about my progress. I get so much support from this and the friend who live near are constantly in contact. Organize coffee dates or evenings out as with children in the house it can be very difficult to talk about your fears etc. Cry when you need to but then move on from it.  This is doable I promise and I realize now that we are actually much stronger than we think we are.

      "Content": "My heart completely goes out to you, and I do understand exactly how you feel.  I had my mastectomy 15 months ago and had a temporary expandable implant fitted which was virtually flat until I had it replaced 6 months later (still got to have a reduction on the other side so still very lopsided). I'm usually an F cup so the different was very, very noticeable. I now have a silicon prosthesis which looks brilliant. I did my fair share of crying too and it's ok to grieve about something lost. I think we kid ourselves that a mastectomy isn't too bad until it actually happens and then we realise how important a breast is and how much we miss it. It's one of the things that makes us a woman - I was sad because I breast fed my children and I loved my boobs - I grieved for a long time.   But I do honestly believe that no-one notices as much as we do. I couldn't wear a bra either at first and took to wearing fairly baggy clothes and a good chiffon scarf can hide a multitude of sins.  The other thing I did which was brilliant was to buy a couple of soft lycra vests from M&S which had breast support and I put the softie in there. It wasn't perfect (ie it moved around a bit) but it did give me the confidence to step outside the house.  I will tell you it gets better because it actually does. I'm not going to say I'm completely ok with how my body looks as it takes a long while to adjust, but I don't look at it with horror now either. I also swear by rubbing Bio-oil into my scars every day and they have faded so, so much which makes me feel a little more normal.  You've been through so much with chemo and everything and I think such major surgery after all that really can knock you for six. Be kind to yourself and don't expect too much too soon - your body has been to hell and back and so has your mind.  You will learn to live with your new body, it will just take time.  Lots of Love Jane xxx",

My oncologist recommended taking antihistamine tablets (Piriton) the day before the injection, on the day and the day after. I did exactly that and got no reaction ever again. It may not work for everyone but it certainly worked for me.  The other thing is it is absolutely crucial that the injection is given really slowly.

I must admit I waited a month or so after finding a lump before doing anything in the hope that it would go away. When she sees her GP they will examine her and if there is cause for concern she will be referred to hospital. Guidelines dictate that she has to be seen within 2 weeks so it will happen quite quickly. But remember most breast lumps turn out to be nothing sinister, but of course she needs to be checked as soon as possible. I know you're probably worrying that she has had the lump for a month already but a month in breast cancer terms is fine - cancer takes a long time to grow I was told by my consultant. The good news is she's found it, she's told you about it and she going to the doctors. If itdoes turn out to be cancer then she will be treated very quickly. You sound like a lovely mum and I do hope this turns out to be nothing but do let us know how she gets on. Jane xx",

      "Content": "HI Lizzie  I'm so sorry you're feeling so scared. I had chemo 4 years ago now and like you I was so apprehensive and scared as I had only ever seen really negative images of people having chemo. The reality, for me, was really really different and it wasn't as dreadful as I thought.  My impression was that I was going to be ill the whole way through and unable to get out of the house or do anything. However, what actually happened was that I'd feel a bit crap for a few days after each chemo (I was physically sick twice over the whole chemo course) but then pretty much get back to some sort of normality so I could go out, do my shopping, meet friends etc etc. By the end of it I'm not going to lie I felt pretty wiped out and it took me a while to really feel back to full strength again.  But it really wasn't the awful awful thing I was imagining. My life kind of just went on with a few bumps in it. Now I also know I was really lucky and some people have it worse but hopefully you'll be one of the many like me who are ok. I think those of us who got through it relatively unscathed tend not to post on here as we don't want to be all smug about it and of course you're more likely to post on here if you're having a terrible time so sometimes you don't know that there are people out there who are getting on ok.  With regards to timelines don't worry too much as the hospital will tell you everything when you go along on Monday. Just make sure you write everything down and ask as many questions as you want to - this is your body and your health and you're entitled to know what's going on. I don't know about the ECG - I did have one as I was going to have herceptin but I didn't have the ECG before my chemo started, I had it before my herceptin started which was on the fourth chemo.  If you're worried about asking questions in public ask your BC nurse, or type out your question list and post it here and there'll be lots of people who can give you advice.  So I'm sending you a big hug and saying take a deep breath, put on your positive pants and believe that you will get through this horrible time...chemo flies by once you're in the routine and I'm absolutely sure it won't be as horrible as you are imagining.  Take care Jane xxx",

      "Content": "Sounds like you are having a horrible time!  From everything you are saying you know you need to see your GP and you're putting off the inevitable which is quite understandable considering what has just happened to your poor daughter.  You may find this lump isn't anything to worry about but you're worrying about it now anyway, so far better to know what you are dealing with.  My lump was above my breast and I was told that your breast tissue goes all the way up to your collar bone so potentially a lump could be quite high up on your chest. Do get it checked, you know you must. It sounds like you have a close family and if anything do it for their sake.  Make that call in the morning, the sooner you get this dealt with the better.

      "Content": "Ha ha! I had a funny conversation with my 16 year old son when I was telling him that when I start chemo I may well lose my hair. He had the brilliant idea of suggesting I get a leather biker jacket and start acting like a Hell's Angel. Apparently to go with 'the look' I could also get my head tattooed as he helpfully suggested it wouldn't show once my hair grew back. He seemed slightly concerned when I suggested I could pick him up from school sporting my new look! Humour is SO important xx",
