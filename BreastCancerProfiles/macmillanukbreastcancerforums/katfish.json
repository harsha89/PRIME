    "Content": "Hi Jo It's a chat with the genetics team, a blood test and then a few weeks wait for results.  The most common test will be for the BRCA genes.  However, the statistics suggest that most people with cancer will not have the genes. I believe for BC that the results of the test may be sent back to your oncologist as it can be used to determine the most appropriate treatments for you, i.e. some of the treatments available for BC are found to be more useful in people with the BRCA gene. The genetics team will be able to spend time with you at your first appointment to explain what the results will mean. I can't comment on how long it will be until your first appointment as it may depend on which area of the country you are in.",
