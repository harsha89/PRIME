I started on the Cipla brand, and was in a lot of pain (I even considered stopping).  I changed to Sandoz and felt better even after a couple of days.  Some find that Sun Pharma suits them best.  It may be worth looking for the thread 'letrozole side effects' as there is quite a lot of info regarding people's experiences there.

I'm hoping to try the Sandoz brand (Cipla is a nightmare), but I won't know until I pick it up if it's the same as Femara ( as it's also made by Novartis). Quite a few ladies seem to get on with Sun Pharmaceuticals brand. I wish I could be of more help, but I'm new to this myself and I'm relying on extra pain meds at the moment... Mags",

      "Content": "Hiya! :-) I had my WLE last October, followed by 15 days of radiotherapy in December.  I'm due for my follow-up on Thursday, but my breast became quite hot (compared to the good one) and a little painful over the weekend.   I went to see my GP yesterday (following advice from Mac Nurse) and I've been given Co-amoxiclav to be taken 3 times a day.  I asked my GP if I should massage my breast (thinking back to when I was breast feeding, many years ago), but he didn't know. Any ideas?  I'm a bit concerned, as I have had real trouble with stitches not dissolving (had to have several removed before radio, had a big 'knot' that came out mid-radio, and several more rising to the surface even over the past few weeks) and subsequent infection.  Worried now that there's something 'festering' in there....

      "Content": "Hi Pinkshoe, My experience has not been anywhere as bad as yours (((hugs))), but I have had infections due to my stitches not dissolving.   It was very much 'touch and go' as to whether my radio would be delayed (I had to attend my first session to find out), but thankfully they agreed to start it and 'see how it goes', as I seemed to be healing well. I'm sure that they will get you in as soon as they possibly can, but as has already been said, the radio is more a precautionary measure, as they will have removed the 'offending lump/s', and they don't want to 'zap' delicate tissue.  For now, please just try to take it easy and let your body heal itself. :-) I was told that it could be some weeks before I get the results of my DEXA scan, but it's just to provide a 'baseline' (so that they can see if the medication affects your bone density), so nothing to worry about. My GP was very understanding when I went to see him (I was feeling very tense and anxious), and gave me some meds that I could take as and when I needed them.  They've helped enormously, and I can now concentrate on my radio and getting ready for Christmas.  May be worth a try? I hope that things improve for you soon hun, Mags :-)",

I'm not sure if it's down to my body makeup, as I had the same problem after my hysterectomy earlier in the year. A couple of weeks after my op (wide local incision with nodes), I was given antibiotics and cream by my GP, as the 'foot' of the incision was slightly infected.  Three weeks later (still applying cream), the oncologist's nurse removed 5 for me but had to leave 2 in (in the vertical incision), as they were stuck firm, and she just snipped the ends off.  A couple of days ago, after a warm bath, one of these finally 'came to a head' and some 'gunk' and a large knot came out. I think I still have one at the end of the lateral incision, but it seems to be under the skin, and I now have two small holes at the foot of the incision which has had some more 'gunk' in it and I have been bathing it with saline and applying the cream. The areas are a bit red, but not swollen (which I was told could cause a problem it it threw out the markings for my radiotherapy, but I really don't know what to do?   Any help would be appreciated, Mags :-)",
