I am waiting for a SNB, which was cancelled last week and might be this week. I was hoping to have the mastectomy within the next couple of weeks but have been informed the plastic surgeon is going on leave therefore my surgery will be 21 st may. My surgeon has started me on letrozole and said don't worry the meds will stop any growth or spread.  I just want this disease removed, is it ok to wait? I can't see any alternative as there is no other surgeon available.",
