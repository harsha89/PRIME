    "Content": "So everyone knows you are ill (again) and stops you in the street to ask intrusive questions about the details of your treatment.  Then they always, always say \"Do let me know if there is anything I can do to help - anytime\".   So today the sun is shining and what I would like more than anything in the world is someone to come with me on a very slow (painfully slow) walk, because I don't feel well enough to go on my own.  I call a few people to ask if anyone can spare an hour to come with me.  Guess what?  All far too busy with their own lives to put themselves out.   That's ok, but please, please DON'T OFFER.  You know that you are only doing it to make yourself feel better and not because you are in anyway prepared to drop everything to help when it is needed.  I understand.  I really, really do - I used to have a busy life like yours.  It's almost impossible to find a moment in the day to put the washing on, let alone change your plans at the last minute.  Just be realistic, don't ay you will help if you know that you can't.  It is humiliating enough having to ask, without being knocked back when you have finally plucked up courage to do so.   Rant over.",
