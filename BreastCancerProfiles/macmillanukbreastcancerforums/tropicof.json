I don't think you know what it's like to be eaten alive by your own mind, which no drugs can help.  I am watching my child lead a worthless life, it's not a lot of fun and it seems there is nothing I can do.  no one realises how aggravating mentally ill people can be..that's why they get drugged and locked up I suppose.    I have more or less come to terms with being abandoned by my family, realised I'm stupid to have bought a funeral because no one is going to go to it, well I have got that far, and it took some doing.  I do not want pity, that's just how it is and I have to adjust to it.   There are solutions which are quite simple but people don't use them !!!  as in diet, exercise, sport.  it IS a huge problem if you become so incapacitated by treatments that,  you can't do any of these.  Having being for walk round Park have managed to somewhat dissipate my fury and my answer to what you said is: \" first do no harm\"   A principle which I fear is not being adhered to both in medicine and in general.  If someone is in interminable pain, being angry with them does not help. trying to fix them does not help either which is that what I think you were doing.  Telling them they are rubbish, \" need help\"  ( I HATE that  put down) is not a good strategy.  this caused the demise of my son so please do not inflict that on me.  Nocebo effect.   Thank you for your input , let's close the communication here, Z",

Sometimes I think about dementia : \" well if they don't know what's happening they're not suffering\"   as long as she is being looked after properly, well everyone is doing the best they can.  Maybe there are gaps, where she is conscious you are there ? with my son there are moments, when he seems lucid and capable.  Few and far between, but suppose one has to make the best of those fleeting moments. Suppose we should be grateful, with these kinds of situations, we don't have to cope with the person ourselves, because we might not be able to,  and might make everything worse, in spite of our very best intentions.   yes,  cancer is no respecter of what other problems you might have, and it all adds up to being too much. LOL I have gynaecologist appointment on Wednesday, worked myself up into a terrible state about it, managed to get out of that state by deciding to write down a piece of paper \" they might use ultrasound\"  \"might use some kind of anaesthetic or sedative\". ffelt bit better next day. wo!bebe123 managed to get back to sleep up 4 Switched on Country File,  it's always nice to imagine oneself on a farm ( in a previous life had relatives who were farmers)   graphic images of a poor benighted sheep, lamb was stuck,  images of blood and gore, the usual , people putting their arms into the creature up to the shoulder to try and help, result, tthe lamb was dead and the ewe, after much agony, died a day later....... my conclusion is, it's pretty horrible being born a mammal, worse if you're a female.....none of us human or animal, can escape suffering in this life.  how much you get,  depends on  ????  who the hell knows really.  which is kind of where all my Buddhist stuff comes from. Found a nice laughter thing this morning : https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=2&v=vGSodapOJhg hope link will work. yes,  IT can be a pain.  Gets worse if you are stressed and hurry.    tthings have to be so exactly right,  miss off one  full stop ,  And it won't work .  I've had a fair bit of stress with  bank things lately caused by.......their security paranoia............ there are a lot of resources on you tube for various things to calm the mind.  And there's a lot of FREE stuff, so by no means all bad. I do Skype laughter most afternoons and it does always change my mood for the better -- laughter useful because it disconnects the conscious mind, the worries.  Sometimes I just have it on in the background while I'm doing something else, still helps. must stop writing here as have  things to sort out  --- like an idiot signed up for a car service plan, +   ccar insurance ,tax  --damn,  one thing about cancer or serious illness is, do not take any major financial dishes decisions during this time... If you do, you might regret it..... will be busy this week, out, scaffolding going up round flats, intending to get out every day to avoid the racket, wwill look at this site aa gain, probably weekend.

Few acquaintances helped out, but they soon got fed up.  Flat in chaos, allotment in chaos, as for loved ones well I haven't got any, silly me.  Schizophrenic son, can't or won't look after himself let alone me,    and family don't want to know me, I've let everyone down.  suppose I wasn't in a good state before this started. Home alone, no money, can't pay for help.  To my horror just read, with chemotherapy &  PICC line, you cannot lift anything over 10lbs  cannot do housework or activities etc, for SIX MONTHS..  How on EARTH does anyone cope with this ?   A month or so would be impossible but SIX months ??? just not an option. as for the hormone therapy, I know someone who is taking it and she can hardly walk upstairs.  got packet of anastrozole but too frightened to take it, already have carpal tunnel and mild arthritis.  Diabolical insomnia. persistent thrush, sore throat which lasted months  -  I've more or less got rid of it by tea tree oil.   prescribed  nystatin , appeared to work then it just came back again.  Felt GP did not really care,  so gave up.  They are just so stressed and busy , impossible to get to see them, if one is not actually near the point of death. and it all seems weird because before the diagnosis, wwas not even feeling ill.  Now seems like my whole life is destroyed, before it actually is. how mad is that ?  oncologist did say to me I wouldn't have to have a mammogram  next year, I could just ignore it all but.... It would not be a slow death.  ominous...... Seems that once the genie is out of the bottle, you cannot get it back in.  Looking back maybe I would have been better, to have not gone for that first mammogram,  known nothing,   had may be ??? a year  ?  two ? and then the curtain comes down. what to do ?  hhave given up eating cheese and milk, well some sources say that will reduce the oestrogen.  Maybe futile, but seem to have nothing else.",

Oh dear.... always the same, balance between adverse effects and benefits.   Bit worrying that different hospitals are so different ?? or not ???

I had a really good friend called Gill in Scotland who recently died.  Yes, of cancer but she coped with it and all the horrible treatments admirably, died at home and amongst friends and family, with I think at least a modicum of peace, and she was quite old, had a good and valuable life,  used to work as district nurse and midwife. What I wish I had was an old-fashioned GP, who had time to listen.  Don't we all !! wish I had a son that I adored !!  wwhere are you still adore him, until he failed Oxford and had a breakdown. Or maybe I adored him too much, my whole life last 20 years has been taken over by trying to fix him.   The adoration has flipped over into hatred (  well some of the time not all) and resentment. probably because I've done too much, but it is so  hard to stop !  so hard to let go.  maybe it's the same with cancer, don't know. If I didn't have cancer I might have a long and horrible, decline due to my arthritis.   So maybe I should just let it happen. Which it might, or might not.  Adjuvant therapy only  increases the chances, it is not a 100% guarantee.",

Yes the insomnia is a damned nuisance.  And then you start worrying about the insomnia and it makes it worse.............. 2 TV doctors I've found, with a good tips =Chris van Tulleken, Michael Mosley. might go out for a walk in a minute, getting some light early in the morning is important, also have been  trying to black out my windows, light at night, is bad for circadian rhythms. yes depression and anxiety damn nuisance too,  best I've found really is mindfulness, as previously said Eckhart.  Although have to admit, do need to rotate various things as the mind gets used to them and then no longer takes any notice.... have a good day,  let's hope it turns out sunny,  like yesterday",

      "Content": "so glad to see your post.   Feeling bad that I was the only one that had refused hormone therapy, I was prescribed and anastrozole which is I think better than letrozole.  But I still couldn't take it too scared of the possibility of bone thinning, yes they give biphosphonate  infusion  against that that that itself has frightening side-effects... As for  letrozole, I know of someone who takes it -- she looks as if she can hardly walk, sso they put her on naproxen to fix this, which has given her terrible acid reflux so they've given her something to fix THAT.  I don't find this reassuring I find it extremely ,alarming. yyes it's a difficult decision.  Have looked into alternative stuff, also just too complicated, also a lot of worry. Experimenting with trying to reduced oestrogen by natural means -- giving up dairy products, more exercise.  We'll even if it doesn't work it won't hurt, and will make me feel I'm doing something.  Found quite a good book which seems very plausible to me:  'oestrogen, the killer in our midst'.   I have been stuffing myself with cheese,  cream, for years, and a lot of fat around the middle. Cancer research UK a reliable source, says that  the oestrogen is produced in fatty tissue.   hmmmmm.  When I asked the oncologist about being fat//oestrogen in diet, she flatly denied any correlation.  Not saying that she doesn't know her job but I'm not sure that I believe her.........",

      "Content": "pleased to know I m not the only one tto have refused conventional treatment !  I don't have a lot of money to waste walking the path alone.  I have grade three breast cancer - underwent mastectomy and  radiotherapy, bbut balked at the chemotherapy and the hormone therapy. I guess one can only do what one can do.  I am so so afraid of being disabled, bbeing ill,  having no one to help.   as for the alternative that isn't an easy path either .  AM  kind of going by this wwebsite, trying like mad to give up dairy products.  Pretty hard to only eat raw food though, just don't like it, take such ages to prepare....[edited] disappointed that medical oncologist didn't support my belief - this is a 'may be' according to Cancer research UK -- that oestrogen is produced if you eat loads of cheese etc.  I think one horrible truth people don't like/don't want to face is that no doctor knows everything.  ",

OMG scary, if letrozole hasn't worked.   there was something written  think 2003, , 'cure at what a cost' one kind of figuring that if I don't have much life left, would rather spend what I have doing things that interest me rather than things which  I hate.  So am interested in alternative treatments.  Surely that has to be the future ?  something non-invasive, that does not cause such terrible damage as the present treatments?",

      "Content": "thanks to all you peeps ladies who have posted  !!  hmmmmmmm, it is all very interesting. I have spoken to GP she says she has  6000 patients, she thinks tamoxifen doesn't give them any problems...... But what I see here says it definitely otherwise.  Looking at the side-effects, I'm going to query tomorrow, this   \" more than one in 10\" lark for common side-effects such as cataract, hair loss, etc etc can't remember exactly what but it freaked me out.  ggoing blind is not exactly a doddle.  I'm already losing my hair and it's causing me a lot of distress.  Stress maybe,  I didn't have chemotherapy. ,  \" more than one in 10\"  -- yes I'm useless at maths but that could be 2 in 10,  5 in 10, or even 9/10 which means you're definitely going to get it !!! What on earth are they playing at,  do they take us for complete morons ? I'm under so much stress my anxiety is  reaching psychotic levels  --  got no family,  mentally ill son who drives me insane, people seem to think I have to do his bloody washing for Christ sake and  Drs  now find something in my liver as well don't know what. chain smoking himself to death before my eyes and I cannot bear to watch it, he will not stop.  If he gets cancer I do not think I will even want to see him and the torture he will be subjected to. I'm absolutely positive that I cannot take even one small side-effect I will go stark raving mad.  people who are prepared to wait a whole year, trusting that it will \" settle down\"  as they are told, I wish I could be like them,  but I am not .  and this contradicts what my GP said to me she said \" people have no problems\"  so what is the truth exactly ?  aaaaaargh !!!! I have found the Macmillan leaflet which says \"physical exercise can reduce recurrence by 40%\"  I have no idea how valid this study is, but maybe any hope is better than none.   Guess we should not panic too much it is just adjuvant treatment, with a certain percentage of preventing recurrence.  Always hard hard to balance out pros - less recurrence less bad things in the future vs. cons , a life of hell in the present. ?   Personally I could put up with side-effects for a week, but a year, no way.  Guess age makes a difference. I am nearly 70.  Five years of constant unrelenting misery,  and I'd be near the end of my life, too old to enjoy it anyway so what would be the point ?  must be a very different perspective for someone in their 40s. Oh well got appointment with a psychologist who is by no means an idiot , tomorrow, maybe oncologist though not looking forward to that one aas we seem to differ, and who am I,  to question all the billions of pounds of research,  etc.  I don't know whether the oncologist is being economical with the truth, to try and get me to take this stuff.  my mental state is so dreadful can't see me putting up with even hot flushes let alone the rest of it.   it's very hard to get to the truth.  I have a horrible, sinking feeling that most women will put up with absolutely anything, maybe for the sake of their ffamilies and \" loved ones\".  Of which I don't have any.  ha ha is this what they mean when they keep saying \" everybody is different \" ?",

      "Content": "always two sides to a story.  I have a son of 40, formerly at Oxford University, going into a care home.  20 years extremely expensive psychiatric treatment result:  100% failure.  Not only do the drugs not work, they cause the most APPALLING damage, such as tardive dyskinesia which is a form of Parkinson's.   definition of abuse: they hold him down, forced injections, ignoring his desperate cries to stop because they are hurting him.  To make it even more humiliating, swear words written down in the report.  So he is punished, for screaming out in pain and despair. Not easy to live with, I often wish that both of us could have died.  all he does is sit around,  play computer games and smoke himself to death.  I'm thinking if he gets lung cancer I won't even be able to stand visiting him. There ARE alternatives, Open Dialogue, which is a language-based method, as 70% of patients back in full-time work or study.  Whereas the present system is the inverse: huge sums of money spent to keep people  alive, but in such lamentable states their lives are of no use to them, or others. pharmaceuticals is where the money is.  whatever happened to \" first do no harm\" ???",
