      "Content": "Hi there! I am currently taking Tamoxifen following treatment for breast cancer last year, and am experiencing awful hot flushes during the day and night. I am so wary of taking any medication for this, my GP has offered me a mild anti depresant, but I'd rather not go down that route. A friend has recommeded STARFLOWER OIL (or GLA ultra) but I am unsure whether it is OK to take this along with Tamoxifen. It says on the packaging that it isn't suitable for vegetarians, and although I'm not a veggie, I find this a strange thing to say! Has anybody tried this, or does anyone know of an alternative. Yours sweatily Hevver",
