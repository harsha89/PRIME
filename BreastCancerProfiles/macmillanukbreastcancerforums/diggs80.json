      "Content": "Hi all, Found a lump about a week ago, it\u2019s right about where my clevege starts on my left breast!! For the past year I have been prone to cysts, had them on my armpits, stomach, legs and a couple on my breasts!! Just now I have quite a large cyst under my left arm which appeared about a week before I noticed the lump on my breast was really painful to start with and although still quite inflamed the pain is gone.  Anyway at first I thought the lump on my breast was Just another cyst but it wasn\u2019t like the others, there was no pain and I couldnt see it so I went to see my doctor on Thursday. Doctor examined me and advised Me to take a weeks course of antibiotics and return next Thursday for a further check up.  I was quite happy with that as I assumed she wasn\u2019t too concerned.  However today an indent has appeared just below the lump and after taking to google I\u2019m now worried sick !! I\u2019m 37 with no family history of breast cancer which I know is in my favour but I can\u2019t help worrying. Anyone had a similar experience ??  TIA  Xxx",
