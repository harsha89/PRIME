    "Content": "Hi all,  Hello everyone. I'm new to the forum - I'm having 3 x FEC 3 x T.  It's been really encouraging and helpful to read back through all the old posts. I'm just recovering from FEC number 2. This time I've had chest pains and lots of discomfort around my MX scar. I've been checked out - ECG fine, bloods fine. But they found 2 subtle clots in my right lung so I'm on blood thinners now. They can't seem to explain the chest pains and have concluded it's probably muscular. I was just wondering if anyone else has found chest pain/discomfort a side effect?  To me it didn't feel muscular at all. Apparently the clots are so small they are unlikely to have caused so much discomfort. So I'm getting anxious about FEC number 3. Has anyone had anything similar?  Jo ",
