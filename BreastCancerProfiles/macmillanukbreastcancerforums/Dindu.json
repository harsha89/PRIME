      "Content": "Well that's 1 week of the 2 gone. My wife seems very calm but I'm having a silent melt down and my nerves are shredded. We had a call from the hospital earlier this week which made my heart stop, but it was them explaining that another operation my wife is waiting for has a very long waiting list and she has been assigned to another local hospital. Now the tricky bit. They said she should be contacted soon with a view to having this second operation (E.N.T. - not cancer related) before the end of this month. If we get a appointment before the results come back I would personally be inclinded to ask for a delay even though we have been waiting over 4 months for it. My reasoning is 2 fold. Obviously my wife (should she be diagnosed with Padgets) would not want to delay treatment because she was recovering from another operation and secondly and my logic is a bit fuzzy on this one, something tells me that if there are any nasty cells floating around her blood stream at the moment we would not want to tempt fate by causing other scar tissue elsewhere ? I don't know my mind is going round and round at the moment and I'm definately not as calm as my wife - but that's me all over - self confessed control freak. This 2 weeks turn around for test results - is that due to the nature of the test itself or is it just workload related ?",

      "Content": "I know it''s not about me, but I want to be as supportive as possible and I just don't know what to say or do. It's like we both know what the other is thinking but dare not say anything in case we upset one another. Thanks for letting me know that 10-14 days is normal - and yes it's a horrible wait. My wife is obviously concerned about the long term health issues but also the sycological impact of surgery (self image). Â I can totally understand how she feels and have tried to reassure her as best I can. We don't know what's ahead yet and must not assume the worst, but then again I think it's probably good to be aware of all the possibilities and be ready to make the correct decision quickly. My wife has a friend who has had reconstructive surgery by removing tissue/muscle from the back and she is suffering with a lot of back pain now. I don't know if anyone has any thoughts on this ?",

      "Content": "My wife was referred to the breast clinic last week and had both a mamogram and ultrasound. The consultant/dr took 2 biopsies from her right breast and said he wanted to check/eliminate the possibility of Padget's. As my wife has had a melanoma removed in the past she is very worried. We have been given an appointment in 2 weeks time to find out what the biopsy's have found. Probably that's normal but it seems a very very long time to wait as we are both really finding the uncertainty very stressfull. On a positive note the mammogram and ultrasound both came back normal. My wife is in a lot of pain since having the biopsies - I suppose that is normal ?",
