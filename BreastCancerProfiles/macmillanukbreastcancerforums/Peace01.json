      "Content": "Hi all I recently had a mammogram and ultrasound which showed up some thickening,  Consultant was not unduly worried but sent me for an MRI to be 100% sure. He said he would call before Christmas to let me know that all was as expected and ok and I would see him for his first clinic in the new year. Today, I received a call from his secretary, he has added a clinic next Wednesday and wants to see me with the results then. To say I am petrified is an understatement, my mind is working in complete overdrive, probably unnecessarily.  I am now convinced something has been found. Really don't want to ruin Christmas with my mood, so trying very hard to put it to the back of my mind. i know that I can do nothing, but really struggling to think positively.  Thank you for listening  Xxxx",
