    "Content": "Would love to join you, but detected in 1970 when I married a Sassenach and moved south!  Used to back to visit, but that has been very infrequent since my mother died in 1995 (my father died in 1966 aged only 49).  Makes me ponder tonight - here we all are offering help and support to one another, and we were unaware that we came from Scottish family roots.  Perhaps there is a hidden message - we should all pull together and offer hope to the future!  Love to all at your shindig whenever it happens!  Let me know how it goes!  Will be there in spirit, but the flesh is too old and not willing!  Mxx",
