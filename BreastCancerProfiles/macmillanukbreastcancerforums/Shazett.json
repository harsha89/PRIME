      "Content": "Hi there,  chemo is different for different types of cancer dependingnonnwhere the cancer is and what type of cells are found. They can have many different side effects and number of treatments. You are probably best to join a group for carers or for people with the same type of cancer as your dad then you can ask all the questions you need.  Xx",

Losing hair sounds really tough but it's temporary and manageable. Def go to a participating boots for the make over or the hospital you are at may have their own centre where they do the same in groups. All the best!  Sha. X",
