Then I started with leg pain,knees, shin's, ank le's, it's like I've turned into an old lady overnight. But I don't want to have to take prescription anything. So I popped along to H&B and they suggested magnesium, so I bought some & got another for a penny ( ha win) I've been taking them for about 3 weeks, it's still there but not as bad. When I get up in the morning I can walk, instead of a shuffle. So early days but hopefully it's an answer. goo  ",
