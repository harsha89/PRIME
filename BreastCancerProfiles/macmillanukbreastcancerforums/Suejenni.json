      "Content": "Hi, Thank you for asking us all what would help, I am at the start of the journey still recovering from my surgery, one of the things that would have really helped me would have been a small cushion that I could put under my arm after my lymph nodes were removed, I did to get comfortable but a purpose made cushion in a bright colour would have helped. Help with parking and fuel costs would also be good currently I have to make 4 journeys a week for dressing changes and as I was self employed before we have now lost my wage, but seem to have more expenses. I also need help with cleaning and ironing all of which I managed before cancer but now have to pay someone. A nice gesture would be a little guardian angel pin that you were given when you were diagnosed, maybe alongside a list of support networks I came across this online forum by chance it would have been nice to know in the beginning that I wasn't alone, and at the point of diagnosis weall feel like we need our guardian angel. Anyway I've rambled on enough,thank you for asking us xx",

I have X-rays which show nothing, so I am just on strong painkillers, some days are better than others. I finished chemo in November 2013 and radiotherapy January 2014, I really do want to get back to work, and this is really holding me back. I see my oncologist next week hopefully I can get some more help then. Hugs Sue x",

I now have strong painkillers a stick for when the pain is really bad. I've had X-rays and they are confident that as soon as chemo finishes all the pain and aches will settle and go. They reduced my 4th dose of tac which really helped. Good luck and hugs sue x",

I have a husband and 2 boys aged 13 and 9. They have been fantastic throughout as they have at times seen me at me weakest moments of which there have been quite a few. I feel that although it has been hard on my close family it has bought out the best in them, my children have been more resistant than I would ever imagined in the beginning. We are now eagerly awaiting the finish line. Wishing you luck on your journey. Sue x",

      "Content": "Hi Welcome on here I have found it really useful , I was diagnosed at the end of April and had surgery in May I was offered a lumpectomy or a bigger operation which involved removing the lump with a bigger margin uplifting my bust and matching up the other side. Initially I did not want them to touch the side that didn't have cancer, however after talking this through with my BC nurse and the surgeon I decided that the later op gave them the best chance of getting all the cance. I also had all my lymph nodes removed at the same time. It has taken me a long time to heal from surgery, however I will not need any surgery at the end. I start chemo on Wednesday so feeling quite scared about that. The only advise I can give you is write all your questions down before you go in there, take someone else with you who will speak up for you, and persist in getting the answers to your questions answered accurately, I quite often asked them to go over things again. I suppose I must have been lucky because I felt everything was clearly explained. Sending you a hug and best wishes on your journey you are not alone Sue xx",

      "Content": "Hi, I started TAC chemo at the end of July, it's good to find someone else on the same as most people are on FEC. I have number 4 all being well next week. I was told at the beginning that it is a hard regime and the effects would be cumulative. I found the first one the worst physically to cope with, the second one a breeze in comparison and the third one I have struggled to get over I don't seem to have bounced back as quickly. My tips would be to get loads of soup in or make some beforehand, and lots of spicy food. I got my GP to prescribe some mouth spray for my sore mouth. I also drink lots of squash and enjoy pure juice ice lollies as they help your mouth. Take all the meds they give you and keep on top of any pain with paracetamol and codeine. I find I get a bit of constipation from the meds so I take senna in the evening to keep everything working usually the day after chemo. If you have any specific questions feel free to ask. Hugs Sue",

I wanted to scream I'm not alright and stop asking me stupid questions. I found that it helped me to be honest with the answer such as 'im not good today but I'm trying to be busy'.or keep positive, my true friends reacted very sensitively and I think it made them think about what they were saying to me and in turn I think that helped them too because they knew the how are you question was stupid too. I also use Facebook a lot as a way of laying my feelings known, I can write as much or as little as I like. I think this journey just makes us a bit more sensitive but that's fine. Hugs Sue x",

      "Content": "Hi I can totally appreciate where you are coming from, I was diagnosed about 8 weeks ago, I had surgery 6 weeks ago, and I am now recovering from that and have my initial chemo appointment Monday. My lump too was painful which I was told was unusual, I was diagnosed with grade 3 stage 2 and it had spread to my lymph nodes. I had all my lymph nodes removed under my left arm , the cancer removed and a breast reduction at the same time I was quite busty before so this was a option for me. The worst part for me through all of this has been the waiting in between appointments, the consultant and my breast cancer nurse have been wonderful and so supportive. Like you I felt like I had been given a death sentence when the word cancer was mentioned, I was frightened for my children and my husband, we have been honest through all this with the children and kept their routines the same throughout which seems to have helped, my boys are 12 & 9. The thing to hold onto now is that breast cancer is treatable and you are now in the system, you have to listen to them and be guided by what they say, which at times is difficult as you feel you have no control. I have been lucky enough to have lovely friends and family who have dropped off meals, cakes, or just had the children to play, flowers are lovely but I have found practical help the most useful. One thing that helped me was to write a blog, I found it a really useful outlet for my emotions, as I didn't want to burden my husband with how I really felt, I could write exactly how I was feeling and felt much better when I had written it, I haven't shown it to anyone it's just my private thoughts. You have also found this site which is full of people further down the line and that gives me a lot of hope, the road we have to tread is horrible but we can come out the other side.

My chemo eventually started at the end of July, I like you became really anxious about the length of time between treatments. My wound wasn't good all the way through chemo and my oncologist kept a close eye on it. It started to heel better once chemo finished, however about 10 days into radiotherapy it started to break down again. My oncologist agreed with me that I was not going to heel until all treatment finished and he agreed to carry on. I finished radiotherapy mid January and my breast is now heeled albeit a bit tender. Try not to worry to much, hard when you are in the midst of things, there will be light at the end of the tunnel. Hugs Sue x",

I looked different and I felt I was loosing my identity, it felt like the cancer was taking everything. However I have to say that when my hair actually came out I was very upset but I was much more accepting of it, I had a good cry and then moved on, the sooner it came out the sooner I would be better again. I tend to wear my wig to go out but in the house I'm happy in scarfs and hats. This feels like I've rambled a bit but I hope it makes you feel you are not alone Hugs Sue x",

      "Content": "Hi I am not in the same situation as you, however I have been recently been diagnosed with breast cancer and have seen the effects on my family and their concerns and worries. As a mum we put ourselves last, before breast cancer I was working rushing the children to football music lessons etc feeding everyone, shopping, looking after everyone else apart from me. Then came the crushing news that I had cancer, it was a bolt from the blue and I felt I had been hit by a train. The hardest thing was telling my children and answering their questions and being honest. They are much younger than you however age doesn't change anything your mum is your mum however old you are. I agree with the other post at times it is good to cry none of you can hold the tears in forever, and you will feel better after. In my experience which is limited I found that once I knew what was ahead of me and I had a diagnosis I felt better it is the periods of waiting in between that I find frustrating and anxious. Which is strange, however I think most of us feel the same. Your Mum will need you to support her now which she will find hard to accept, I have felt really guilty when I have seen my 12 year old doing things I wouldn't normally expect him to do. I have found practical help the most useful lifts to the hospital a trip out for a coffee, a cake left on the step or all the ironing taken away. Expect your Mum to have bad days support her with a cuddle and give her time alone to digest information, I sometimes just needed some quiet. I hope this helped I wish your family all the best and use this site it's full of love and support. Best wishes Sue",
