      "Content": "Thanks DreamThief, I am not to sure on the chemo regime but was coursing more towards doing whatever else if offered besides chemo.  Yes, I am aware that chemo is a great thing, however, my personal preference would be surgery first where possible.  It does sound to me that this may not be possible in her situation. In any regard I will get more clarification on Thursday. I would say that Canada is high on this scale of research but it's always useful to understand what other countries are doing as well as any advancements etc.  I do know the USA gets drugs to market that aren't necessarily available in Canada so my thinking is to always see what is available so as to make the best decision possible., Yes, there is Sunny Brooke in Toronto :) as well as Princess Margaret but advancements are being made all over the world as  well that don't necessarily make it to Canada as fast as some may like.  In any regard, just checking for Thursday if I need to bring up other alternatives to the doctor that may have been overlooked (we are all human and doctors do at times make \"mistakes\"/incorrect decisions).  I have seen this with my own eyes in my own family so I don't always want to take what they are saying as the only available option hence the reason why I am reaching out.  Thanks again DreamsThief for the valuable information.",

      "Content": "Hi Ellen, I am sorry to hear of everything you have gone through but I am glad that you are on your way to recovery. It sounds to me that because of the HER2 status and drug for this that Chemo becomes the option.  In reading your situation, my initial thoughts would have been to question that if one knows they will need a masectomy, then why not start with that so as to limit the amount of chemo.  However, you have explained the protocol well Elaine. I will see if this is the same in Canada or at the least get an answer from the doctor as to why this plan of action. You are an inspiration Ellen and hope only good things to follow. Thanks for taking the time to write back to me!!",

      "Content": "Thanks Kacang for the experience. Could you tell me then that since you had surgery first, did that mean that the amount/number of chemo sessions were reduced?  My biggest concern is to try and reduce the number of chemo sessions needed and that is why my thinking was that if one could do surgery first then that would potentially mean less chemo.  Could you/someone comment on that or is the protocol for chemo the same regardless. Thanks for sharing...",

      "Content": "Dreamthief, Thank you so much for the prompt reply.  So based on what I am hearing, aside from trying to shrink the tumor, can I suspect that the removal of the breast is still is a viable option? (please don't think I am nonchalantly in favor of this however I am simply looking for options/alternatives) Or is it because of the HER +2 she will definitely need chemo and there is no other way around this.  I see 2 competing problems that may counter each alternative. Now, being 30 years old, there is the possibility of having kids and I would hate to see any chemo ruining those chances (yes and I appreciate they are trying to save her) but if this is planned and tackled properly I think maybe she can have the best of both. Equally important, do you suggest any of these tests get repeated.  My understanding (from reading) is that HER+2 testing can sometimes be inaccurate not to mention testing for the cancer.  Thoughts on that. Lastly, if you, DreamThief, or anyone else have any strategies or anyone that you may suggest for a second opinion (anywhere in the world, even in the UK) that would be greatly appreciated.  Just trying to help her make an informed decision (although the ultimate decision is hers/there's). Love this group and glad it exists...  ",
