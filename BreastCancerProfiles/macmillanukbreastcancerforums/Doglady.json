If it doesn't  work I have got a wig on standby. Does anyone know if I do lose a lot of hair, can I wear my wig in between sessions?  Can I  wash my hair tomorrow before the treatment or not? I feel more nervous today at the thought of have chemo than I did before I had the masectomy which is very odd.  If anyone is also having there first session tomorrow or is already on the journey please can you let me know how you are doing x",

When I returned I was told my score was 3.4 and chemo was strongerly advised. I have had my first cycle of AC chemo and have had bad SE including a uti. I am just wondering if I have made the right decision.  I would be very interested in anyone experiences. Thanks x",

I have recently had a scan on the remaining breast which was called 'busy' by my surgeon,  the scan results came back ok. Whilst I am very pleased, I am wondering does anyone check the masectomy side?   This is such a wonderful site, I always read the posts and gain so much information from you all. Sonia x",
