      "Content": "Hi Danielle I am in the same boat as you. Had a lumpectomy on Thursday with 2 nodes taken.  Getting my results this Friday and it fills me with dread.  I feel sick at the thought that it may be somewhere else in my body.  I feel fine during the day as I keep busy and put it to the back of my mind but can't sleep at night as I can't switch off.  Night terrors driving me mad! I already know that its stage 3 aggressive, so  Chemo is on the cards.  Hope I can try the cold cap as I also do not want to lose my hair. Louise xx  ",
