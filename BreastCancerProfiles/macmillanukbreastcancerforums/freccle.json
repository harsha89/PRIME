    "Content": "My daughter had a very similar diagnosis. She shaved her hair off around day 18 after her first chemo and I had mine shaved at the same time for Brave the Shave. We had a few friends round and filmed it and it felt a much more positive action than just letting it fall out. Plus we raised about Â£1500. She had her tumour and all her lymph nodes (3 affected) first then started chemo about a month after that. She had epirubicin and cyclophosphamide for the first 3 cycles and had her first docetaxel last time. (The ECT mentioned). Whilst she was told by the nurses that docetaxel was a \u201cwalk in the park\u201d in comparison to epirubicin and cyclophosphamide she defintley had a much more severe reaction to that. I\u2019m just glad it\u2019s the last cycle to be given although she still has two more to go through",
