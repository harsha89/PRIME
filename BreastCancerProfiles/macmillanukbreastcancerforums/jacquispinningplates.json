I had the planning/ tattoos a couple of weeks ago which was ok but I'm dreading the chin/ head strap which sent me into an irrational panic when they put it in place.  I've read that radiotherapy is easy compared to most experiences of chemo? would you agree?  thanks, Jacqui  x",

I'm already exhausted and I've only had a few scans & biopsies. I'm amazed where all these ladies get their energy and drive from - I'm hoping I'll get some by being here! I'll be thinking about you tomorrow /sending positive vibes hun. The waiting all the time is what I'm finding hard - I seem to lurch from one day to the next - dazed and confused! Hope your results are the very best they can be. I am back Fri too for last biopsy results whereupon I will hopefully have a clearer treatment plan and they will need my reconstruction decision - think I'm leaning towards immediate DIEP, although the lure of implants is seductive! Can't quite believe the decision making I'm doing! Fingers crossed for us both - let me know how you get on - sleep well tonight. Deep breaths Jacqui x",

I can see given all the surgery you'd already had, that the thought of further surgery was just a step too bloody far! The tummy tuck is undoubtedly an attractive part of the offer though! But I think my biggest worry is the thought of implants being affected later on by rads. I'm such a wuss (needle phobic to boot!) that I can't bear the possibility of having to have surgery later on if the implants need more work. Can I ask if you have had any radiotherapy?  Thanks again Jacqui x",

I am worried about implants being compromised with radiotherapy etc... but not sure if I'm being naïve in thinking that DIEP - despite longer/ more complex procedure and recovery - is any more likely to reduce the need for further surgery in the future ...? I know we have choices, but sometimes I just wish I didn't have to make all these choices cos it's all a bit scary and unreal (I am wasting time googling nipple tattoos ffs) Help!",

I do have a Section scar, but he had a nosey last week and said it's very low down, so there shouldn't be a problem for the DIEP (I think he was politely saying 'you've got a lot of flesh there we can still play with, love').  I am slightly concerned about any future need for a hysterectomy (I'm family history - so awaiting BRCA gene results). I'll ask about this at my next appointment on Friday when I get final biopsy results & finalise treatment plan. Feel like I'm surrendering myself to be butchered!
