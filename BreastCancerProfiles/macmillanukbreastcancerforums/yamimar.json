    "Content": "Hi Lelotron, I am in a similar position to you, was also diagnosed on Thursday with two mucinous carcinoma DCIS intermediate grade. Apparently the two lumps I have are less than 1cm but I\u2019m thinking that one of them is bigger than that as it feels at least 2cm.  I also have pain on my upper back, left arm and suspect that this is due to stress and not anything more serious as it tends to happen when I think about the whole situation ahead and then feel emotionally and physically drained.  I\u2019ll be having a CT scan next week and MRI the week after, then we\u2019ll see what\u2019s the next steps in terms of removing the lumps but I\u2019m  I\u2019m also thinking about having double mastectomy. I mentioned it to the Dr and he seemed to think that it won\u2019t be necessary... I don\u2019t know what to think.  Good luck with your treatment, I\u2019ll be thinking of you and wish you all the best.  Yamimar ",
