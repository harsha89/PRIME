      "Content": "Hi Nikki I didn\u2019t know I had a lump either and was symptomless. The lump couldn\u2019t be felt by the clinic when I went either. This is partly because it is very deep apparently. The lump is 10mn so quite small. Because it couldn\u2019t be felt I had to have a localisation wire fitted prior to the lumpectomy. None of the procedures were too awful though. When do you get your results?",

      "Content": "I was recalled from a mammogram in Nov then had another mammogram as a small mass had been spotted. I then had an ultra sound which ruled out a cyst and a needle biopsy. I was called back for another needle biopsy as they were\u2019t \u2018happy\u2019 with the results. When I went for the results of that in Jan I was told it wasn\u2019t the mass they were concerned about but the \u2018active cells\u2019 and the lump was an incidental finding. I needed to have a wide excision biopsy which I was booked in for and had done within a few days. Has anyone had the same experience. I\u2019ve tried to be patient and do get my results in a few days but I am confused. How worried should I be?",

The nurses on here have been fab and are sending me some info about options. I guess that one of the difficult parts is not discussing it with family or friends because I don\u2019t want to worry them. My children\u2019s dad died just under a year ago so we are just trying to get back on track. Everyone on here is so lovely and reassuring even when their own journey is tough. Kez",

It\u2019s good to be in that position (rather than just being told what to do)but really scary in case I make the wrong one. I know I\u2019m in a luckier position than a lot of people do feel that I should give myself a sharp kick up the bum and get on with it!  I hope next week goes ok. Let me know. X",

      "Content": "I\u2019ve recently been given a diagnosis of LCIS. I had a lumpectomy due to a fibroadenoma so I know the whole area has been removed. I\u2019ve been offered tamoxifen and yearly mammograms but am unsure what the best option is. I know with LCIS it isn\u2019t malignant but that the risk of it developing a malignancy are a concern. My GP said he isn\u2019t a fan of tamoxifen due to the side effects and also because it might not develop into anything. I\u2019ve also got a friend who opted for a pdmx straight away because she wanted to eliminate the risk. I was just wondering if anyone out there had any experience of this situation. The information out there is so conflicting I just can\u2019t decide what to do. Any help would be appreciated. ",
