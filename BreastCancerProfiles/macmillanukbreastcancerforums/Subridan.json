      "Content": "Hi I am a breast cancer survivor, who , following lumpectomy and removal of lymph nodes, underwent chemotherapy and radiotherapy, followed by tamoxifen.  It was suggested that I ceased taking the Tamoxifen and change to Arimidex, due to a very large polyp developing on my cervix - which was not cancerous, but Oncologist suggested change.  Other than the polyp and the dreaded weight gain and hot flushes, all of which I could cope with, I was ok.  However, within months of being on Arimidex, my joints are really aching.  I have to shower as I find it hard to get out of the bath due to my aching joints.  I am just 59 and feel older than my husband who is 71 and is a bowel cancer survivor.    I am taking Omega 3 and Glucosimine.  Help - do I continue with this for another 3 years or go back on Tamoxifen and ask for an annual smear to check it has not caused problems in my cervix?  ",
