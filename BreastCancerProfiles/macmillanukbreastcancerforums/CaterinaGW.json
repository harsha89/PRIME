    "Content": "Hi Tessa - it's been some time since your post but I wanted to say what you've written has really helped me, encouragement-wise. I have just joined the site and posted something about losing my hair & the cold cap, but i do find there is just not enough info out there, certainly in the hospitals, about the cold cap and it's very true what you were saying about them being more concerned with your life & you amost get the feeling you are being a bit ridiculous to persevere with the cc. How are you now? I hate that epirubicin stuff!!! Cathy S. Â ",
