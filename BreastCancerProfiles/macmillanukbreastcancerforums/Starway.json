      "Content": "Is anyone else facing the huge dilemma of choosing to continue with hormone therapy another five years.   I have completed my five years on Letrozole from which the side effects werent too bad - joint pain etc but did cause me to lose lots of weight so I was worried about my bones My consultant suggested I try Tamoxifen and see how I get on but if the side effects prove difficult it may not be worth the few extra percentage points.   I am getting worse/different side effects on the Tamoxifen after six months and really feel that my body has had enough after chemo radiotherapy and herceptin plus the h=five years hormone.   I am post-menopause.   This is such a hard decision to make and looks as if I am the one that has to make that decision.   Is anyone else in this position.  ",

      "Content": "Hi  Such hard decisions arent they when it is left to us to decide.   I guess because its all fairly new and based on a certain amount of research this taking hormone therapy for 10 years and even so I dont think they have much evidence of taking 5 years letrozole followed by five years tamoxifen.   The NHS tool just groups all the hormone therapy together.   I agree - if you are given a higher percentage improvement then I guess its worth battling with the side effects but if its low then its all a balancing act.   Just keep trying to check out all the research.",
