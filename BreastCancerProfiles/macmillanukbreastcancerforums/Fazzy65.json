      "Content": "Morning all I had my op yesterday, after a very harrowing morning Inserting wires to the 2 lumps found! 1 we know was cancerous 2nd we yet to find out on follow up appointment in 2 weeks, surgeon said he had to take a lot more breast tissue than 1st thought as the lumps wasn't as close together as shown on scan, he mentioned liposuction in 12 months time wasn't quite taking it all in!! Sentinel lymph node was taken out a little had spread to that but he feels he got it all!! Find out next part of treatment  on 22nd Feb, chemo was mentioned  as I'm triple negative and the cancer all be it small was a grade 3. Just glad its out!!!",

      "Content": "Hiya Just an update nipped to see BC nurse today due to fluid in breast and scar was inflamed with 2 little cream coloured blisters on scar looked like puss but was dry!  BC  nurse checked  me over and she said she wasn't concerned it's not Infected it's just the seroma fluid leaking out! My scar travels from my breast to middle of sternum so the 2 stitches on my sternum are getting stretched  through movement so she gave me dressing padding to put in my bra for comfort and to allow scar to heal naturally, so  no concern from BC nurse so I feel much better now. Scheduled to see surgeon  next Friday for outcome of operation  Elaine",
