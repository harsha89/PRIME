      "Content": "Hi I\u2019m new here .... I had single mastectomy in December , had grade 2 bc with micro mets in one of 3 lymph nodes removed.  I was given 1.9 % benefit for chemo; and oncologist advised hormone therapy via tamoxifen and monthly hormone supression but could have chemo if i wanted; being advised that risks of having chemo may outweigh benefits.  After a terrible 3 weeks decided to take the advise of oncology and started Tamoxifen 3 days ago.  Is there anyone else who has taken this path ? Would really like to hear from you. ",
