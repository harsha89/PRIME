      "Content": "Hi Chocolovely :) I've been on Tamoxifen for over 2 years and I've never been an emotional person but I cry at Hollyoaks nearly every week !!  It does make you very emotional but I wouldn't say I'm depressed, I just cry at things I wouldn't normally cry at :) I had really bad flashes but that did settle down, I still get the occasionally flush but not near as bad as they were.  I think it's quite funny at times to be bubbling and laughing at the same time xxx I won an award a week ago and I had to get up and collect my cheque I nearly did a speech Gwyneth  would have been proud off........VERY embarrassing !!!!! Xxx",

      "Content": "Hi Anne, I worked right through, I had chemo, lumpectomy as the 6 chemo I'd had reduced the tumor enough for me to have a lumpectomy and 25 days of radio, now on tamoxifen.  I think you'll know what's right for you, I felt the need to carry on as normal as I could.  I would get my chemo in the afternoon come home and ride out as I knew I was going to be under the weather for a few days and then pick things up and return to work on about the 4th or 5th day after chemotherapy, I have to say it kept my head in a good place and I loved the feeling of normality!! Nobody will know what's right for you any better than yourself, the days I felt poorly I put the feet up and chilled but I really did enjoy some normality in what was a crazy year and sometimes it's just too easy to say I won't do anything today!! You'll know what's right for you :) xxx best of luck with your treatment",
