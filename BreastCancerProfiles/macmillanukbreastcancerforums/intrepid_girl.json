      "Content": "Hello forum readers... I've been taking Tamoxifen (20mg) since Dec 2012 (two years now, can't believe how time flies). Doctors seem to shrug off side-effects of Tamoxifen as if women don't know what they're actually feeling. I wish they didn't make women think they were 'making it all up'. I'm a very rational person and am finely tuned to my body. This is my take:  Whether medical science thinks I've lost my mind or not, I have physical symptoms that I did not have prior to taking Tamoxifen. I'm going to exclude the following: HOT FLUSHES, FAT BUILD UP, LACK OF VAGINAL LUBRICATION (as these are documented side effects of Tamoxifen) Hot flushes are exacerbated when I drink coffee or red wine.  From a size 8 I am now an 8/10 and overnight I have a bootylicious derriere, chunky thighs and a mini muffin top.  ( I am not happy with this, okay, i'll accept the beyonce bottom!) I read many anecdotal stories about women not continuing with Tamoxifen because it makes them feel like they are 90 yrs old. I didn't understand what they meant at first,  but now I do. After 2yrs on Tamoxifen, I have general symptoms of stiffness in (HIPS, ANKLES, FEET, ACHILLES TENDON, CALF MUSCLES)   At night my right calf often gets cramp and my achilles tendon (right side) feels very tight, so i end up massaging them in the night.  Lucky I'm single so I don't disturb anyone. When I get out of bed in the morning or if I've been sitting for any length of time, and I get up to walk, I can't just 'get moving'. It's like my body has seized up. I need to gently wiggle and stretch all the above, and after about 30 seconds I'm supple again. I can do this without anyone noticing, but 'I NOTICE'.  ACHING RIGHT HIP - my hips have never ached in my whole life, not even when doing chemo. But now they do, especially the right one. I have no idea what's going on. I do not notice any mood issues with Tamoxifen, purely physical manifestations.  I wish the scientists would accept that women know their own bodies and try and fine-tune these hormone therapies as increasing numbers of women need to take them. It might increase the compliance figures, as it's known that lots of women abandon these drugs without anyone knowing. This isn't good. MY SUMMARY:   Tamoxifen HAS changed the way my body fires up/activates. I am stiff and more like an old lady than the 'girl' i was. BUT, I've seen the clinical research and it's a known fact that Tamoxifen and AI's can halve the risk of recurrence. I want this benefit. At this moment, I hate the side effects of Tamoxifen, but I hate the thought of getting a recurrence MUCH more, so I continue to take it. I have set myself a goal of 5ys, and then I'll reevaluate things. I want to be alive and that's the bottom line with all this. It's a personal choice whether we accept the many annoying side effects with an overall peace of mind that oestrogen is being blocked from binding to any receptors on cancer cells. So, to any scientists that may be reading this, please 'fine-tune' how Tamoxifen works so women can have a good 'quality' of life, as well as just 'life'. Best wishes to all of you, in whatever stage of your journey.   intrepid",

      "Content": "Dear Yvonne, this is the reality of breast cancer from my personal perspective. I'm 2yrs down the line from BC at age 46 (ER+ , HER2 - , WLE, ANC, FEC x 6, Rads x 15, and now Tamoxifen 20mg) I do recall having the same initial thoughts as you have posted, but the reality is you simply cannot go back to the 'old' you again. It just doesn't work like that for many reasons. BUT you can find a 'new' and just as amazing you.  'A new normal' is a phrase often used. THANK GOD AND MEDICAL SCIENCE, breast cancer is nowadays highly treatable. But the reality is, that it's not like getting a flu, or a broken arm. It's impact goes right to the core of us, it's devastating and fills us with fear and dread, and we need all our strength to overcome it. The strength that you might have used before to make the pigeon lofts.  The reality is that a diagnosis of breast cancer, or any cancer i'm assuming, is 'profoundly changing'. It touches us, physically, psychologically, emotionally, spiritually, sexually. Nothing is the same/works the same as it did before.  It stops us in our tracks and forces us to reflect and re-evaluate our lives. And honestly that has probably been the most positive thing about my whole BC journey. The chance to re-evaluate and reinvent a new and better self.  From a former highly active, sporty girl without a care in the world, I am now a 'different but still vibrant girl'. I need to take it a little easier, but that's okay. I can still do most of the things I did before, just in moderation and not all at the same time.  My advice is to try to 'go with the flow'. Work with your medical team, and push yourself through the treatments. When you feel fatigued, allow yourself to rest. When you feel a little bit of energy, try and capitalise on it. Trying to expect yourself to get back to the old you, will be frustrating and traumatising, because in all honesty, We are changed. We are changed. But we have survived. We are changed. But we are alive. I don't think I can put it any better than that. I'm not sure if any of this makes sense right now, but in time it may do. I wish you strength and peace of mind to take on your way. intrepid ",

      "Content": "Hello, I think Caroline93 may be a little confused about the significance of hormone receptiveness grading. Breast Cancers can be tested for the following pathologies: Estrogen and Progesterone hormone responsiveness. Your pathology results will appear like this: ER+ or ER -  and PR + or PR - Someone who is diagnosed ER- and PR- (negative) will gain no benefit from taking hormone therapies such as Tamoxifen and Letrozole etc. as their breast cancer is not hormone responsive. If positive there is a figure attributed next to it such as:  ER+ 7/8  or ER+ 1/8 Hormone receptivity is categorised from 1 through to 8. In lay terms it simply designates how hormone responsive the tumour is. ie,  a tumour that is 1/8  is not very hormone receptive and 8/8 is highly hormone receptive. THis has nothing to do with being 'severe' or 'aggressive' or being less or more likely to recur.  There are not the correct words to use.  All it means is that hormone therapies are likely to be more highly successful on highly hormone receptive breast cancers. Someone who is ER+ 8/8 and PR + 8/8  will get higher % benefit from taking Hormone therapies than someone who was ER+ 1/8 PR+ 1/8. Hormone therapies such as Tamoxifen and Letrozole/ Anastrozole, work by stopping estrogen and progesterone hormones from attaching to rogue cancer cells and feeding them and encouraging them to grow and multiply. Tamoxifen has been clinically trialled over decades and is known to cut the risk of recurrence by half if taken for at least 5yrs. That's why 'IN MY PERSONAL OPINION' it's best to try and 'live with' the annoying side effects and get the benefit of recurrence risk reduction. I've been taking it for 1yr and 4 months.  Anyway, I hope this explains a little more about hormone receptiveness. Be strong, women are amazing creatures and can overcome even the most challenging trials and hurdles. intrepid",

      "Content": "Hello Kathleen, I had the same symptom when I started taking Tamoxifen in January 2013. For me it's a kind of allergic reaction to the Tamoxifen. I'm taking Cetirizine Hydrochloride, a common anti-allergy medication that can be bought cheaply at any chemist, without prescription. Of course run if by your GP first, as I'm not a medical specialist, but it certainly worked for me. Doesn't help with other side effects of Tamoxifen though! Best of Luck Intrepid",
