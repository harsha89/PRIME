When I saw the reduced side first I could have cried!! It looked wonky and misshapen. However it now looks amazing and I'm thrilled with the results, your body has been through a lot it may just need to settle  All the best  Sarah",

      "Content": "Hi Lizzie,  I haven't read the article and I'm not sure I want to after seeing how it has made you feel. What I can tell you is I had my final chemo on Monday. While it hasn't been fun it has been entirely manageable. I have got three young children and have managed to carry on as normal as far as they are concerned. I didn't cold cap so can't help you there, but if I have wanted to do something then I have within the advice given. Yes there are days when I feel rubbish but there have been more days when I have felt normal. Please don't let this worry you before your own journey has started Sending hugs Sarah xx",
