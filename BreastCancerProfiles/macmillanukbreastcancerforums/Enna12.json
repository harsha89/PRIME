      "Content": "Hi! Don't know if anyone else has this problem but here goes. My back is so sore! Had lumpectomy and Sentinel nodes out then radiotherapy now on Anastrazole. It feels like millions of ants with ice skates are dancing over my back and sides. Gp thinks it might be neuropathy., just ruling out B12 or thyroid problems first. Don't know if I am just a wimp but it is really beginning to get to me",
