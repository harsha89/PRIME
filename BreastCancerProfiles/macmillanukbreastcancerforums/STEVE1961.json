    "Content": "Dear all, have been reading some of the discusions on here, truly inspirational stories.... My wife (45) was diagnosed last friday with stage 1 grade A (predictive), Oestrogen + ductal BC 1.2cm lump .. She is having her Lumpectomy on 24/25th of this month and been told she will need radiotherapy and Tamoxifen afterwards .... She has not shed one tear, not admitted that she is worried, will talk about it as though she as a blister and is infact sat across the room doing her studying for her BPTC (to become a barrister)... Ive spent the last four days in complete shock and googled and googled and googled... arghhhhhhhhhhh and the nurse said as i left the hospital with my wife on friday 'dont google anything'..I KNOW THIS IS NOT ABOUT ME !!!! but how do i get my wife to mmm worry a little for herself or should i just allow her to get on with it as she is ....... Thanks everyone x x x",
