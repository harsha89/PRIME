      "Content": "Hi Aspen, So sorry you find yourself here! I just wanted to reassure you though. I had FEC-T, starting Feb 6th and finishing may 26th this year. While I can't pretend it was pleasant, it's absolutely manageable. Like you, I had chemo before any surgery and honestly I felt pretty well after the first dose, especially as you get steroids which made me buzz with energy!  So, it will get tougher and you will need to be kind to yourself but don't write Christmas off, you should be able to enjoy it from a physical point of view though your emotions will be all over the place if you're anything like me. Much love.",

I feel exactly the same.  If you're like me your anxiety over recurrence has become such a powerful force, such an evil creature that it's almost become an actual character, a personality, alive somehow. Something that strong won't easily be silenced so whenever you dare to be happy it raises it's ugly head and warns you its' still there, tells you not to be too happy.  With the help of some CBT (on the NHS) I'm trying to accept good days and if anxiety pops up acknowledge it's presence but say, \" I know you, I know your game. I've seen you but I'm far too busy dancing/drinking cocktails/ enjoying the view so feck off!\" Does any of that make the slightest sense? Caz x",

My surgery was just 6 weeks after end of chemo and 8 weeks before radiotherapy which I finished a fortnight ago. Obviously the boob is numb and as I had lymph clearance, the armpit too but in addition a large area of my tummy is numb.

I can list what it is, left breast 9cm tumour, at its widest point, grade 2, stage 3, ER+, Her- but I don't believe it. I can feel it, i found the feckin lump, too young at 46 for screening, but I don't believe it. Is it just me? My point is, before surgery I feel I need slapping in the face with reality. Perhaps, this is a downside of chemo first. What I'd really 'like' is to see an image of it. That's my question, has anyone ever seen any images of theirs? I know the MRI is thousands of images, but somewhere in our fat files is there a picture I could ask to see?  My oncologist rang last night to say an MRI i had done just after chemo 3 showed shrinkage and my lovely family and friends are all hugely excited by that. All I can think is, I'm having a mastectomy, what does the size of the tumour matter. But maybe if i could see pictures, I'd be able to see progress and start to believe it's actually there!

As you lie there in your Bert bag (whatever that is), waiting to be examined, you must be wondering what you did to be ousted along with Mrs and Mrs Fallopian. Our relationship began so well. You were there when I was born already stuffed with all the eggs I'd ever need. True, it took you a while to get the hang of releasing them and you never did learn the art of punctuality but I forgave you that when 14 years ago you released your first perfect ovum. It contained half of everything needed to make the cutest baby, most loving toddler and all round funny teenager. You triumphed again four years later. Thank you so much for another perfect little man. Eggs weren't your only job of course, you are my primary source of Oestrogen and Progesterone. I was very grateful for this in my teens when they gave me a waist and boobs, less keen on the hairy armpits though if we're being frank. I don't blame you , how were you to know, that years later one of those boobs would go rogue, tits-up if you prefer, and start to harbour a great secret. Not content with allowing cells to grow uncontrolled it looked to you for help! Damn cheek, actually using my own hormones to aid it in it's evil multiplication. So you see, you just had to go. I'm sure it wasn't a complete shock, those hideous Zoladex implants must have been a bit of a clue that you were no longer welcome! So, as we part ways, I just want you to know that I'm grateful for all you have given me and that you at least, stayed cancer free, but I refuse to shed any more tears over your loss. I do hope you understand. Love from what's left of Carolyn. Ps should you bump into my lymph nodes please thank them for doing their very best to help out, hopefully they've saved me.",
