      "Content": "Hi, Definately speak to you BCN about this, it was never offered to me even though I am only 37, but I already have 2 children.  As for the two chemos mentioned. The 1st one I haven't had but the 2nd one is the T part of FEC-T. I had FEC-T. I actually wasn't too bad on the Docetaxel, it made my mouth sore and I lost my taste for a bit but it was better than being sick. Hope you get the answers you are looking for soon.    ",

      "Content": "Hi,I'm 36 and I found a lump on the 28th of July and went straight to my doctor. Unfortunately they were busy and I had to wait 6 days before seeing my GP. I really worried during this time, scared of what it might be, which I think is natural. When I did see my doctor she was very reasuring and felt that it was probably only a cyst. Which was a massive relief. I went off on holiday with out that burden. Of course to be on the safe side I was refered for tests. When I got there I was really calm and it was only during the ultra sound that they said that they were worried. Luckly I only had to wait 4 days for the results and I was in turmoil. I felt sick, anxious and terrified of the answer. Unfortunately I do have breast cancer, however I hadn't realised just how common it is to get lumps and bumps in the breast and even if its not a cyst it still might not be cancer either. So my advice is, as hard as it may seem is, don't worry yet. But in the event that you do have cancer this site is the best. The help and understanding of everyone on here is amazing.    I only told my husband about the lump but no one else until I had been diagnosed. I think if you can talk to someone either a partner, friend or family member it helps get you through the waiting. Good luck I hope for the best possible results for you.  ",

      "Content": "Hi Everyone, Well this is one group I had never expected to be part of but here I am! I was diagnosed on the 19th August with breast cancer. It all came as quiet a shock as I am only 36, which everyone keeps telling me is rare (personally I think they are trying to make me feel special! lol) So the past couple of weeks have been normal for me, I've ran around after my 2 boys and done all the normal stuff I would do over the holidays with the exception of telling friends and family my 'news'. This is about to change, on Tuesday I will be having my op, to remove offending lump. My cancer is about 2.5cm wide so they will be taking a sizeable chunk from my right breast. Thankfully they will be doing a spot of surgery on the other to make it match. Even the darkest cloud has a silver lining (boobs headed south after breastfeeding!)  So I suppose I would like to hear any stories of what to expect afterwards, nothing to scary though please, lol.

      "Content": "Well the op went fine. Was really groggy after and struggled with my breathing and oxygen levels due to asthma. But after getting home having a bit of food and a nap i felt much better. The breathing sorted it's self out with in a couple of days. I also had some lymph nodes removed and have found that this is the bit thats causes the most problems. Movement is pretty good now but still a few inches to go to full movement. Consultant was pleased with how it went and was very optmistic. Two weeks later I am back at the unit. All seemed to be going fine, until...... It has spread into your lymph nodes which means we want you to have chemo. This wasn't too bad I was sort of expecting it. What i wasn't expecting was that I will also have to have a mastectomy too. This really did catch me off guard and really upset me as it had never come into the equation. Now a couple of weeks later I have come to terms with it and focusing on the chemo. I start Chemo on Tuesday. I'm nervous but i know it's for the best. Worried about getting a cold though. Once the chemo is over I will have a mastectomy followed by radio followed by hormone tablets. Long bumpy road ahead. Hate to say it but I hope I make it. Thanks to everyone who replyed to my first post, It was reasuring to hear your stories and experiences. Hope that you are all doing well. xx  ",

      "Content": "Hi, I'Ve had two operations but it was the second one that leaked. It was really scary, but was actually fine. Apparently when you've had surgery fluid can build up behind the site and can find its was out through weak spots. I now have anchor scares, in my case it was the joints that leaked. I went to my nurse at the GPs and they dressed them as they did trickle a fair bit. Have them checked out just to be on the safe side, but try not to worry about it. Easier said than done I know. Hope it all goes ok. X ",
