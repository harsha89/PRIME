    "Content": "Hi everyone, I have a family member in Spain who is a Spanish resident that is deteriorating. She lives about 4 hour train journey from the major hospital she's had previous treatment with in Madrid. Does anyone know of any community cancer services like in the UK or anything that can be of help.Â  We're trying to find other help options other than going back into hospital as this is the last thing she wants. No idea where to go from here so any ideas are welcome.",
