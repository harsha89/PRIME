      "Content": "Hi Ronstar The appointment went as well as it could thanks.  The size of one has changed - not 14mm but 30mm but that one is behind the one that is 10mm.  They are going to attempt a lumpectomy and I meet my surgeon on 14 July with surgery on the 17 July so there is a plan in place.  There is a fallback plan in place depending on the results three weeks later but at least it's all heading in the right direction.

      "Content": "Hi Everyone I am a Newbie to this Group and I am still trying to process what is happening at the moment but can't fault the speed or the care.  First ever Mammogram on 9th of June as part of 'The X Trial'.  Got a recall last Wednesday and I went to the appointment on my own as the lady that did my mammogram explained that I may be recalled as it was my first one and they sometime have difficulty establishing a baseline.  I wasn't overly worried but wasn't  expecting to be told they found a shadow on my left breast.  This was then followed by an examination, ultrasound and two biopsies all on Wednesday morning. I went on Friday to get the results and was told I have two areas of cancer - one is 10mm and the other is 14mm but in different quadrants of the breast.  I had an MRI on Tuesday this week and I am back this afternoon for the results and hopefully to be told which surgery is best for me.  I have a list of questions as long as my arm so I hope to get them answered later today.  All I can say is that someone is looking out for me somewhere because if I hadn't been selected at random in this trial it would've been another two years before my first mammogram at 50 so I am counting my blessings - but still perplexed by it all. ",

      "Content": "Hi Ronstar Sorry for the silence - just been busy coping and now back at work.   My surgery was changed from 17 July to 19 July and  was performed by a different Surgeon who was great and all went well.  I went for my results and there was no spread to my lymph nodes but I was kept in as the wound was infected so had to have it debrided under a general anaesthetic.  As the amount they removed was bigger than 3cm and Grade 2 they had to do an Onctoype test which thankfully came back showing that I didn\u2019t need chemo.  My wound is still not fully healed but thankfully have been released form wearing a bra 24/7.  I went to my first appointment with the Oncologist on Tuesday last week she said it was about 3 weeks away from being fully healed.   I had my Radiotherapy planning appointment date through yesterday which is on 4 October so now making steady progress so fingers crossed the wound is healed in time. x Fiona",
