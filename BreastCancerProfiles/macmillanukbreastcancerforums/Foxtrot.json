      "Content": "Hi, this is my first post and a bit unsure of what to say or do other than I would like to hear and share experiences. I was diagnosed with stage 2 rectal cancer in 2015 and had surgery and chemo lasting 2 years then in 2018 after a routine mammogram I was diagnosed with triple negative breast CA . Have had lumpectomy and  am having chemo at present which will be followed by radiotherapy. I don't know anyone who has been diagnosed with 2 primaries so close together, does anyone have any similar?? ",

      "Content": "Hi Seaspirit 44 Really good to hear from you. You sound like you have an amazing plucky spirit. Yes I felt I had come through and coped so well with rectal cancer and all the unpleasantness involved I had a bag (which has been reversed) but even now my bowels are very unpredictable. This diagnosis of breast CA was a total bolt out of the blue. I know I am a really strong, positive person but sometimes I really do feel a bit crumbly and its very hard to articulate to people who have little or experience of cancer.",
