    "Content": "I am a bit confused with what happens after treatment has finished. I'm not finding the medical team to be joined up in their responses.  Can anyone advise me when I will be likely to get a mammogram.  I am feeling very anxious as to whether the cancer has actually gone and don't want to wait a year before I find out.   ",
