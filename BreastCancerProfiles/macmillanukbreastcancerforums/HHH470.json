      "Content": "Hi all I had a mastectomy end of august, no reconstruction, I'm still feeling very stiff, rock hard and tightness. All I can feel is ribs, it's uncomfortable to lie on that side also. I am slender, do others feel the same? Will it feel softer at some point? I am having physio in the arm pit area and I rub bio oil into my skin. Just wondering if someone is in similar position  I'm also having chemotherapy at the moment so perhaps that's not helping with sleeping! Louise",

      "Content": "Hi JollyG Yes I had lymph nodes clearance also so physio is for tightness in armpit and movement. Doing the exercises does help.  I probably have only started to lie on the mx side for about 2/3 weeks luckily I sleep on my right side not my left. The actual scar is looking good very neat and rubbing bio oil helps. Take care  Louise ",

      "Content": "Hello I had a mastectomy and lymph node clearence 10 weeks ago. I have physio once a week since week 7 as very stiff around scar, armpit and side/ribs. Could get my arm raised but just started chemotherapy and feel I've gone backwards as arm and scar aching! Think its all all going to take time. Wearing a bra sometimes irritates the armpit as the elastic rubs against the scar. I had the left side removed so driving was difficult I can only managed a short distance. Take care. X Louise",
