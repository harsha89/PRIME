    "Content": "Hi there Just thought I would let you know that I have chosen to have treatment privately at the Christie Hospital, Manchester but only because we have BUPA Insurance. I was treated so quickly, having scans etc within a few days and started chemotherapy a week after diagnosis. Very comfortable private rooms and the nurses are lovely. I also have an emergency contact number should I have any problems. If my oncologist isn't available when I have my chemo he telephones me to check how I'm doing to see if I'm having any side effects or any problems. I have to add that I would be just as happy having my treatment under the NHS because I am sure the basic treatment would be exactly the same, it's only the frills that are missing. The only downside I can see for opting for private treatment is that our insurance premiums will soar next year. Good luck with your treatment Lorraine",
