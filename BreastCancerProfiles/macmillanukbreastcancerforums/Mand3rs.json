    "Content": "I have been on Tamoxifen since December 2008 and then in January 2011 was changed over to Loxifan.  When I started Tamoxifen I had the ache in the arms which went away after a few months.  Since starting the Loxifan the ache has come back but much worse and I am also suffering from dizziness.  Are these both known side effects of Loxifan and do they last very long.   Should I go back to the Doctor and ask for a change of medication.   I live in rural Spain and don't have access to the facilities in the UK where simple questions can be answered easily.   This sounds a silly question but ........... since starting on the Loxifan my body odour seems to have changed into a far more musky smell !  I'm still getting the hot flushes and need a couple of showers a day but don't know whether to buy Mum or Gillette !!!!  I know that the Tamoxifen and Loxifan are eostrogen suppressants so is this something to do with it? Has anyone got any experience with these situations ?",
