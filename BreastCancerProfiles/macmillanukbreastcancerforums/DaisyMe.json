I am replying to you as I have secondary breast cancer that has gone to my bones, I know you did not mean any harm in your post, but you can imagine when you read something that says oh in the bones so to speak is not very positive for me, I don't mean to offend but it is not nice for me I hope you see where I am coming from. God health to you all the way.",
