I'm a yorkshire girl too - the forecast is awesome for tomorrow so I'm planning a proper 2 hour hike - will post some good pics!  I can't believe the difference that walking has made - the difference it has made to pain levels is nothing short of spectacular. Best wishes - photos will be on tomorrow. Xx",

The ward was too bright for me. Also I had some podcasts on my phone and earphones while I waited - I drew the short straw and got the 4pm slot for surgery so was particularly glad of radio on tap.  Now I have 4 pillows for sleeping in a U round me because it stops me rolling which I prefer and a light blanket to pull up to my chin because I found my duvet too heavy to pull up as high as I normally do. Those are personal preferences but have made me happy.  Forgive if you are an expert on this game already or if too much detail but those are the things that made a big difference to me. ",

      "Content": "Hi sideways61 I had to reply to your question!  I was walking 1 - 2 hours about 3x per week up to op so that was my baseline  I had a rt side mastectomy on 13th Dec. I walked 10 mins on 14th Dec. I did no walking on 15th Dec as it was bitter cold and the cold has such an effect on muscles post op. Then 16th I tried 20 mins but got a bit dizzy and had to go slow. 17th 15 mins on a little flat road. 19th I walked for over an hour. Was amazing but probably a mistake.  By 2 weeks post op an hour was ok as long as I then rested. I have to say I sat down for almost all of the time that I wasnt walking for the first 3 weeks. Im 9 weeks post op and can walk 3 hours in a stretch now.  It is so individual and I'm a bit of a nutter. I pushed myself harder than I needed to now that I look back. I think I just needed to then. A bit less than I describe woukd be wiser! The thing that I would definitely say is that going in the car bothered my back so that meant that travelling to walk confused the issue. Also flat predictable surfaces are a very good idea. Unpredictable uneven surfaces and gradients caused me a lot of pain very quickly- for me it worked to walk using my core as little as possible. Hope that is helpful.  Also going to bed for a week works very well for some.",

Xxx It makes your legs so heavy. I was fast asleep at 7:30 last night and was completely disoriented at 8:30 when my son and hubby came from a sports thing. I had no idea why they would be awake before me when I am always awake hours before the house. Nothing is your fault. Left hand and right hand. Not you. God bless that nurse and all like them. The system doesn't know if we should be leaning on the hospital or the GPs does it. Just lean everywhere I reckon. I don't know if you are a multivit person - I'm not as a rule but I took one with iron in it with a glass of orange juice on a regular basis for a couple of months. I think it might have helped.  I really hope you get a good day tomorrow. Today has been better my end. Have finally cooked the piles of rhubarb and pumpkin that I meant to cook a week ago so the boy had rhubarb and custard with his dinner and I had pumpkin and coriander soup for lunch.

AnnJac Im so sorry that it is taking so long - here's hoping that you will have a little accelerate in the healing now that the sun has come out. Violetsniff I love Monty Don - my favourite gardener.

Xx Beautiful still water and warm light at Eccup reservoir this evening in my little evening walk. What a lovely day. You are all such a lovely support - I get excited when a walk has a beautiful view so that I can photograph it. I hope that everyone has got all the joy out of today that was available. I'm really excited that we have two more days of the sun. My phased return means I dont work tomorrow. Hurray for being out in thw sun. Xx",

My lovely friend gave me a couple of private physio sessions which must sound horribly indulgent but has been has been amazing. She specialises in post mastectomy care and I have found the exercises that she has given me very useful. It has also been interesting to talk to her. She was very clear today that I dont even need to think about why I'm so tired. She said think.of all the healing your body is still doing: of course you are exhausted. I found that very helpful because it is nearly 3 months since my op now and I really really want to be better!! I hope all are well - AnnJac how goes the healing?",

Violetsniff I love to think of you crafting and nattering - I have brought all I need for the next blanket on holiday with me!  Can't quite believe that I'm only 2 days in Spain but here is today's walk along the coast in windy Tarifa.And a little pic of a lovely square when we went for a walk to explore in Estapona.  I hope everyone is well - will post more pics tomorrow - I managed 235 active mins today so this tourism lark ia keeping my steps up!!",
