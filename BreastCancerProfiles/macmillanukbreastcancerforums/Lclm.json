    "Content": "Just have to add that about 14 months post chemo (not sure how long my hair actually was because it was in tight ringlets but lets say 6 inches, no haircut)  I was with my husband and cavapoo who about a year and a half.   Who is similar coloring and curl to the dog above.     Noticed lady in cafe glancing at us.   When we walked past to leave, she commented.   \" I was just saying how funny it is that dogs often look like their owners.   Did you get it to match your hair?\"   Without thinking, I told her the truth that when we got our puppy I did not have any hair so in my case it was the owner looking like the dog.\"  Still miss my red wavy hair (and oddly sometimes I miss my turbans and scarves) BUT happy to have my blonde curls.   My children especially love them.    All the best, ",
