      "Content": "I hope this is ok to ask. My friend of 25 yrs has found out at 36 she has breast cancer, I was away on holiday and her husband rang me when I got back as it was the day she started her chemotherapy (last Friday) I'm going to see her on Sunday and wanted to take anything that will help relieve her pain, she is suffering with oral thrush being unable to eat, sickness and generally down and in shock as it's all happened so quickly, I think she's struggling mentally too, I have looked up and read about aloevera toothpaste and ginger but anything else you can add that will help will be a great help. I wish you all the best on your journeys and hope you all recover ❤️ xx ",

      "Content": "Thank you too! The mouthwash sounds great I'll Check it out now and get the ingredients, hopefully no nuts (she has a bad but allergy) I presume they will do alternatives if that applies. Mags/Memory stick - brilliant idea! I didn't even think about keeping occupied, I was just thinking of relieving the side effects. Thank you so much and good luck to you too xx ",
