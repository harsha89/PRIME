      "Content": "Over Christmas I had 2 unexpected long drives ..the first to collect one of my GDs & the other to take her back ...in between I looked after her...as she was heavily pregnant.  All went well with her & she gave birth to a beautiful baby boy 31st Dec.  I had a couple of incidents of palpitations & mentioned it last Tues when I was in the Unit for my 8th Herceptin.  Major panic amongst the staff...& a 10 lead ECG & print outs sent up to cardiology.  Result was OK to have injection. I already had Echocardiogram booked for this Monday...so that will show up the situation properly.  Slightly concerned...won't get results until I see specialist Nurse following Monday.... ",

He also said I had Left Atrial Fibrulation & although I didn't need medication I should have a check every year.  I have asked 2 different GPs at my previous practice as well as my current GP & they have said that his letter to them says no such thing!!  ?? Cardiologist thinking I'd go privately every year?? I will explain to the Echo person tomorrow that I need some info....   At 68 ...69 at the beginning of March....I sincerely hope I do not have a heart problem as well as the cancer! ",

When the cardiologist said it was probably due to too much caffeine I stopped all coffee immediately & then had the mother & father of all headaches due to the suddenness of stopping!  I then drank coffee but started swapping full caff to decaff 1'cup a day at a time & gradually weaned myself off full caff.  I have now also cut down the number of decaff coffees I have & drink a wider selection of hot & cold drinks.  Thanks for kind thoughts & responding to my post. ",

I was diagnosed with BC Feb 2016  as the result of a routine mammogram\u2014 I had no signs or symptoms.  I opted for mastectomy & they took 1 lymph node which was clear.  Next came 4 rounds of TC then 17 ( 1 year) injections of Herceptin accompanied by Tamoxifen (18 months) When my Oncologist saw me last he said  1) in January I am to swap from Tamoxifen & start Anastrozole...for 10 years.  2) I was very fortunate that I had that mammogram when I did ....6 months later & it would have been a different story.... So ladies.....anyone any info on this change of drugs...?? TYIA",

(was 9 yrs but started in Jan ) I saw the Plastic Surgeon very recently about a reduction to make me symmetrical. Waiting to hear if the Hospital will allow him to go ahead...he was very positive ...there is a 3-4 month waiting list. He cannot operate until my BMI is below 30 anyway.  Last Nov. my BMI was 36.2 I have got it down to 30.1 ...my next target is to get it to 25.  Keep smiling! It confuses everyone!!",

The only people who are allocated a MacMillan Nurse are those needing palliative / end of life care.  I do not have a specific Nurse allocated to me in the Chemo unit.  The whole team are very great & caring but there is no one I can talk to who knows about my medical situation. ",
