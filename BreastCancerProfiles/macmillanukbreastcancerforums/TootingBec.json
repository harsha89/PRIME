    "Content": "My situation is very similar, except I didn't find a lump - mine was picked up through screening in May.  I nearly didn't go as I'd had a mammogram a year before due to lumpy boobs.  I got called back and I wasn't worried (they said they call back 1 in 20) - they did 5 individual small mammograms on the left, then a ultra sound and then biopsy - but they still weren't concerned and sent me off to ring in two weeks for my results.  Then a week later they rang to say they had found something! A 'small' cancer - shocked doesn't really go any where near what I felt!  I'm sure you all can relate to that. I saw the consultant the next day. She was brilliant and explained everything and we felt 'ok' about it all as it was very positive and treatable.  I was booked for a lumpectomy the following week.  In short I had two ops the second was just to completely clear the margins, my nodes are all clear.  The next step is Radiotherapy and tamoxifen. I hear myself in some many things you've all said - I AM so very lucky - the initial treatment was so quick I didn't have time to think about it, everyone was so supportive - but now! well I feel like I'm not me! I need to get the RADS before I think I can move on  I had my surgery 8 weeks ago, I have my Rads planning appointment next monday and I've started the Tamoxifen - I'm about 10 days in.  Since last week I've felt so tired and disconnected, I've had headaches and heartburn! No hot flushes yet........ I've started taking the tamoxifen at night now at around tea time and it might be working (yesterday I felt ok, today I had a snooze!!!) - but its effecting my sleep?  Does anyone else feel this?  My dreams are constant and I don't feel like I'm sleeping - I keep seeing someone standing over me - I shout at them open my eyes and on-one is there!!!!! Maybe I just need more wine....... Thanks for all your posts, they have helped already x",
