      "Content": "Frillyflower I havent posted for a while but today is 6 months since my diagnosis. My lump was found on mammogram, 1.5cm (originslly they said 1.7). I had lumpectomy and then radiotherapy and im on Tamoxifen for 5 years. Confirmed as stage 1A I too am an academic and had just had a promotion. I worked throughout (had surgery over Christmas hols) and had no time off sick. I was lucky as i had no side effects at all from treatment and colleagues were great (I told them as soon as family knew).  Im so glad i carried on working as it was a distraction whilst waiting for results after surgery and also helped maintain \u2018normality\u2019.  I am now getting on with life although on days like today i think \u2018 did that really happen to me?\u2019.  Good luck with your treatment and recovery.
