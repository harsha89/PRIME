      "Content": "Hello Kate Yes unfortunately it is a definite diagnosis.  She has had the biopsy which has shown the cancer.  She is due to have a lumpectomy next week and has been told she will then have radiotherapy at the least.  She is being very positive and has loving support from her partner.  She does not live nearby but I am going over to her next week whilst she has the operation.    They have said they will then have the further results a week after this.    Sharon",
