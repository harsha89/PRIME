      "Content": "Hello, I am very sorry to hear that you are going through this, I am 46 years old and had a double mastectomy in November 2015 after finding a lump in my left breast (18mm) and also there was a smaller one (10mm) in my right breast. I had never had any surgery before so was a bit nervous but everyone in the hospital made me feel looked after and calm. They told me I should only be in hospital for one night but in the end I was there for two nights. I'd suggest taking ear plugs and an eye mask to help you sleep as wards can be noisy and they don;y turn the lights off fully. Although on the first night I was still quite drowsy after the general anasthetic! Also I got back to the ward after dinner had been served so you may want to take some snacks with you although in  the evening they did manage to find me a sandwich to eat. They wake you up early in the morning in hospital and there can be a long time between first wake up call (6am ish?) and breakfast, so a book to read and/or music to listen to can keep you occupied. You may have drains on both sides after surgery which can be a bit cumbersome so front fastening pyjamas is best and I took loose comfortable clothing to change into for going home in.  I would also agree that lying on your side is likely to be impossible for a while after surgery so I had to sleep almost sitting up with 2 pillows, which I did get used to. I didn't need the strong painkillers after surgery that they offered me so just took some paracetemol, but everyone is different so if you need it take it- the nurse said to me 'don't try to be brave' My whole chest area felt very sensitive and sore for a few weeks but it did die down with time, and also taking the post surgery exercises gently is a good idea. I am still doing mine twice a day as I still wake up a bit stiff! Hope this helps and that everything goes well for you. Best wishes",

Also I have a pre - existing liver condition so Tamoxifen was not the best route for me. I also assumed Tamoxifen was given to everyone but I'm happy to follow my oncologist's advice on this.",

      "Content": "Hello, I wanted to write to you as I was in a very similar position a couple of months ago. I am 46 and had a bilateral mastectomy in November 2015. Prior to surgery there was no indication the cancer had spread to my lymph nodes so the surgeon said chem was 'unlikely'. However after surgery the pathology report showed that of 14 lymph nodes removed on my left side, 1 contained cancer (my right side was thankfully clear)  However that meant I was 'borderline' for chemo. When I saw the oncologist, she said the decision as to whether to have cancer was up to me. She said the hormone therapy would provide around 85% protection and chemo an additional 3% protection. She did not offer any opinion and I did not feel I could ask. I didn't know what to do, but I was offered a test called EndoPredict which was being trialled which would look at the genetics of my cancer, and would return a low risk or high risk of recurrence. I felt I needed something more concrete to base my decision on so I immediately said yes to the test. That involved another oncologist appointment and waiting 10 days for the result- more agonizing! When I got the result I was hoping for a low risk result but I had just strayed into the high risk category, by 0.1 on the score! So the oncologist said that really I was still borderline and again it was up to me! I really wanted someone to say 'yes we think you should have it' or 'no, we don't think it's worth it', but after a couple more days I decided not to have the chemo. Mainly because I have another underlying chronic illness which would make chemo present some other risks for me. But I made the decision myself and decided not to be influenced by others' opinions, as I felt I wanted to have responsibility for it, so that if the worse should happen and it comes back, I won't be tempted to say to someone 'but you advised me against it' That being said, when I told the oncologist my decision, she said she agreed with me. Thinking about it, if the extra protection was something like 10% I think I would have tried to have chemo. So I think having the Oncotype test may help you make a more informed decision. It's clear from all the replies that everyone has to come to their own decision for their own reasons. I wish you the best of luck!",
