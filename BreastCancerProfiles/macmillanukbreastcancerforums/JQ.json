    "Content": "Hi, My mum found out last night that she has to have a bone scan as her calcium levels are slightly up \u2013 2.56.  The nurse said the lowest range is 1.5 \u2013 2.5, so 2.56 is slightly up.  They have been going up and down.  She is due to start chemo soon for BC.  My Mum is worried she has bone cancer now.  My mum feels well, has energy and is not in pain.  She had her op to remove the BC lump on 24 Sept and there was no spread and we were told at the beginning that the blood results showed no spread.  Does anyone else have high calcium levels?  Could it be parathyroid which they have tested before?  But if they are only slightly up why send her for a bone scan?  If you have BC can you then get bone cancer even if the BC had not spread to lymph nodes. Thx  Julie",
