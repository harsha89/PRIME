      "Content": "Hi Daisy. I'm a nurse too and can completely relate to your experience.... I picked up on so many clues from the first doctor who examined me at the hospital (the look on her face) through 4 mammograms on the right side where I hadn't even found the lump, ultrasound guided biopsies and then the arrival of the breast care nurse before I was called back in.... It all seemed like such bad news. On a positive note I can say I have had fantastic care from my local hospital. The treatment wasn't fun but it was doable and made so much better by my having people looking after me that I trust. Makes such a difference. I've always been proud to work for the NHS and having now been on the other side as a patient that has been reinforced many times over. This website has been a life saver too. Sensible sane advice when I couldn't think straight enough to make sensible decisions about myself! The support on every level is amazing although I do think women, generally, are fab at supporting each other... Good luck to you Daisy, whatever the outcome on Tuesday. Love Debbie XX",

My last chemotherapy was on 28th September and it's only been in the last week or so that I'm feeling more like my usual cheerful, optimistic and energetic self. I also had FEC-T. I'm with you on the \"Oh don't you look well\" comments! Must admit with a bit of make up on I can convince myself I don't look so much like we should be calling an undertaker any time soon! Seriously though it is amazing to see what the body can cope with and still stage a recovery! Wishing you a very Merry Christmas and a Happy Healthy New Year. Debbie xxxx",

I also felt very tight and painful across my chest for several months afterwards although it does gradually ease. I found doing the exercises helped a lot. After about 6 months I could comfortably lie face down without any issues and don't feel I have any restrictions on my lifestyle. Went back to horse riding after six weeks. I did find the numbness very odd to start with across my chest,armpits and back of my arms. Some sensation has returned in my arms and armpits but not significantly across my chest but it doesn't bother me in the least now. So yes it will stop hurting and you will get back to doing the things you want to do - plus a few I could have cheerfully not gone back to like hoovering! I did manage to string that out for quite a while although when my family realised I was mucking out horses and riding they did get wise to me haha! Hang on in there; it will get better.

I have been overwhelmed that people take the time to respond to my questions and for the hope I have gained from so many people.  Good luck with your last treatment Fiona.

      "Content": "Hi Rachel I had a bilateral mastectomy with immediate implant reconstruction 2 years ago. Like you I'm a keen horse rider and didn't want scars anywhere else or a long recovery and possible loss of strength. I'd be devastated if I couldn't do all the heavy work associated with looking after a horse! I was told I probably wouldn't be able to ride for 6 months but have to confess I was back on board after 6 weeks. Very naughty but in my defense I did ride the horse I share with a friend who I know well and is pretty bomb proof. My husband caught her, groomed and tacked up so all I had to do was get on from the mounting block. We then went out for a plod around the local tracks with my husband on foot. All very sedate but, boy, did it give me a lift! I drove after a month and was out walking a week after the op. To be honest walking was easier than getting out of bed as I had 4 drains initially! I'm used to be very physically active so did feel quite an invalid at first but gradually things improved and I was able to look back and appreciate how far I'd come in a few short weeks. The first 2 days post op were the worst in so far as pain went and I accepted all the medication I could have but I still managed to hobble around the ward.By the 4th day I was walking around the hospital. My consultant found me in the hospital canteen and decided I should go home! After the first few days Paracetamol was sufficient for pain relief and anyway I hated the Codeine as I felt spaced out and got constipated. Your list and other peoples suggestions seems to have most things covered. The very best of luck to you. Debbie xx",

Time really does help and that can't be hurried along.  I was having a lovely day a few months ago and thinking how good I felt when a nagging doubt entered my brain say \"yes but what if it comes back?\" Almost at the same moment I thought I'm not giving in to that thought. Today I am well and I'm not going to spoil today worrying about something that may never happen. If the worst does happen I'll deal with it again.... It seemed to have been a turning point for me.

Once I'd got the results and knew I had to have a double mastectomy (no choice as I had several lumps in both and 2 different primaries) I felt so much better. Once you have a plan this time will fade into insignificance. Big hugs to you and sorry you're having to go through this too. Debbie xx ",

I was told I would need 3 months off work (I'm a nurse).  Unfortunately I got an infection around one of the implants during chemotherapy so it had to be removed. Last July I had an expander put in and next week I'm due to have both implants changed. The expander has been no problem at all. Little hard and tight now it's at full expansion but I'm still working, cycling, horse riding etc. Have a look on the Keeping Abreast website for advice as well. Good luck! Debbie x",

They'll never be exactly like my own boobs but in some ways they're better as they won't droop and I can go braless! Hope you have a great bank holiday weekend! Debbie xx",

There were days I wondered if it was worth it but gradually bit by bit you will get better and stronger. Unfortunately I had chemotherapy after the op which resulted in abscesses around my right side implant which was eventually removed in October just after I finished chemotherapy. I'm now on the waiting list for an LD flap plus expander op. The left \"breast\" looks great. Different to the pre op me and it took a while to get used to how it looks but now I'm really pleased with it. Good luck tomorrow J. Debbie xx",
