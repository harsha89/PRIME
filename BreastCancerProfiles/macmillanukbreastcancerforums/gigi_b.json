    "Content": "This is my first ever post but I just wanted to wish you all the best as you start your treatment. I too had a lumpectomy and sentinel node removed, this was followed by 6 lots of chemo, 20 radiotherapy treatments and now the joys of tamoxifen. As scared I was at diagnosis (not what I planned on turning 40) there are lots of people who wish to help, my breast care nurse especially. Â There is a lot to be positive about, but do not feel guilty when you have a down day.",
