      "Content": "Hi ladies, I had Sentenial node biopsy and lumpectomy done on 15th September 2011, unfortunatly they didn't get a clear margin so I opted for a skin spareing masectomy with tissue expander inplants, I had the second operation on 28th October 2011 and like you was eager to return to normal and back to work..... with the first operation the lymph node scar played me up more than the actual breast scar, so i thought the second operation would be a little less painful in truth it was the site where the drains was healed well but just ached and the breast wound healed well within two weeks, it the fluid build up thats getting me down, its like carrying a half filled water bottle round, strange sensation, and can well make me feel slightly sick.... I got my sports bras off the internet \"Z Bra\" designed by the medical proffesion for ladies doing high impact sports.... not comfortable, feels like some sort of mediveal torture device... but i'm told its essential that we wear them for support. they don't come cheap £ 37.50 for one !! I went back to work on both occassions after one week at home, although i had a sick not for 3 months i asked the doctor to write that i could still do my job but may need a little flexability with hours days etc..... I found that returning to work between operations kept me sane, I wore loose fitting tops to disguise my changed shape...... i work in an accounts department so a lot of my work is desk based, although i did forget on occassions and carried heavy files.... my operation was on the left side, and i am left handed so should have been more aware. I don't regret going back to work so soon, I should be starting my rads/chemo soon and hopefully i will be able to go to work on my good days..... everyone is different but if you want to go back then do... I wish you all good luck, and remember there is a light at the end of the tunnell",

      "Content": "Hi can anyone please answer a question for me??  About to have my last Chemo session of FEC-T on the 18th May... this gives me flu like side effects.. runny nose, sore throat, headache, aches and the usual symptoms you have with flu... I also have injections to boost my white blood cells the last I had on Monday... Today i had an appointment with my consultant who examined me and said that the lymph gland in my right armpit was swollen.... my left breast was the naughty one last time and has since been removed... he has arranged for a scan.. but what i would like to know and that he didn't answer, is can flu make underarm lymph glads swell or is this the start of cancer again.... he said go home and don't worry, easy said than done    ",
