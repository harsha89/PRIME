      "Content": "HI Smitten - I was just wondering what type your original breast cancer diagnosis was, and also curious since you had a mastectomy why you were having radiation. was there other cancer found outside the breast? I just have an odd place I've noticed on my reconstructed breast and while it's not purple and bruised as you described yours, I am interested in what you learn. I've reached out to my onc and will likely see her next week. Thanks! - jltandreilly",
