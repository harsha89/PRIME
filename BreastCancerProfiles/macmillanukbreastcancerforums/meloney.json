    "Content": "Hi this is my first post on this site - having finally plucked up the courage to spend time to read what others have lived through I thought somebody might be able to help me with a silly sounding query that came into my head whilst lying having the radioisotope scan last Thursday. I'm due to have my first FEC-T chemo on Tuesday and the nurse said my hair could be out by the time of the second. I was thinking of trying the cold cap - the oncologist said 50% success, the nurse 33%. But it struck me last Thursday that even if the cold cap works the hair that grows during my treatment will be grey and I will not be able to do the roots. Somebody mentioned that maybe I could use henna or a natural colour  but that was just a guess. I presume I can't use ordinary hair colourants. I'm wondwering if it  worth putting myself through the cold cap to have to just stripey effect of white roots .  Does anybody have any experience they could pass on re this?Thanks Pauline",
