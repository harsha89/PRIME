      "Content": "Hi Bedford69, my sympathy is with you Â - sounds like you have had a very stressful time with history in the family, diagnosis and now double mx. I had a double mx with no recon in July 15 following diagnosis with lobular tumour in R breast - finding out that lobular is very hard to detect and that it is likely to occur in the other breast I had an elective bilateral mx and decided against recon - age 66 and small breasted. I was terrified of what lay ahead but in fact it all went so well - I didn't need any painkillers at all post surgery I came home with 2 drains on each side which were tended to by district nurses for 10 days - uncomfortable but not painful and easily removed. Do not be frightened - it is all very manageable. I was able to drive when the drains were removed and have had no problems since. Good luck with everything that lies ahead - you can do it! Linda",

      "Content": "Hi Carlie, as everyone says the anticipation is worse than the reality - don't be scared. I had a bilateral mx on 6/7 - my decision, the surgeon would have done a lumpectomy but with a history of BC in th family and the fact that my grade 2 2cm tumour was lobular I decided to have both breasts removed and thankfully the surgeon was willing to do it. Like you I was very anxious beforehand but my experience was very positive. I did not have to take any pain killers afterwards!! and apart from 4 drains - 2 under each arm - I suffered very little distress. When I was discharged the district nurse came in every day to check and empty he drains - no big deal. After 10 days they were removed with absolutely no pain or discomfort- I was dreading it! You are on a journey which you don't want to be on but if you take a positive attitude and don't read too many of the horror stories that others have experienced you will get through it and surprise yourself at how resilient you are. Chin up and good luck",
