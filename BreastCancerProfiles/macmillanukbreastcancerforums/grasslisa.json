I've been told to stay off work for between 8-12 weeks depending how I feel. It's hard not been able to do the things your use to and you will need lots of help for the first few weeks. My stomach scar is really tidy and is healing lovely :-) it's so nice to wear a bra without a prosthesis too. Any questions I can help with please feel free to ask x",
