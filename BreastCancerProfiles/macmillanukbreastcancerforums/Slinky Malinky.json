    "Content": "Hi, I have literally just signed up to this forum but I have read your post and just had to reply. I was diagnosed last May and having gone thro all my treatment I'm still having to wait until July to find out whether they've got it. With this in mind I too am tearing my hair out (if I had any). I really don't want to patronise you...I'm sure everyone is saying 'keep your chin up'  It'll be ok'. This is all good and well when their not the one's going thro it. In the meantime while your living in wait I've been told to plan daily things that make me happy...bugger everyone else, it's all about you. You're right this bc makes you paranoid and scared every minute of every day and no one gets it. Try to be strong and positive because I think that's helped me so far...alternatively go out into a field and SCREAM. Take care. I'm always up for a chat xx  ",
