    "Content": "I have had four cycles of F E C, now starting on four cycles of taxotere. To me, F>E>C> isn't so bad. I was never sick and only nauseous when I decided not to take my steroids during the third cycle. I soon decided that being awake at night, and a bit excitable for four days after F E C were worth paying NOT to feel sick and nauseous. Also, if you are taking Dexamethason, and Zofran to tackel the sickness/ nauseous, be awarethat it is probably the Zofran making you constipated ( Be Prepared.... have a laxative ready to take should you need it... that caused me a bit of misery.) I felt just fine the day of chemo, and not so bad 2 following days, but when you stop taking the steroids, there is a bit of a downer, where you do feel weary, and a bit sorry for yourself, but, for me, after the 8th day, I had more energy, and by the four days before the next chemo, I felt good... I even went to work then. I have gained a bit of weight, but not a massive amount, and I try to go for a medium to long walk 5 times a week. You will get through this.... It is best to use humour and every day, think of all the good things in your life... It really does help to stop cancer taking over your every thought. I really hope you don't experience the sickness/nausea, and if you do, REPORT IT cause there are a lot of things they can give you to sort it out. Good Luck",
