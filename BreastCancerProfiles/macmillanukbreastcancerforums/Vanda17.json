      "Content": "Hi Deb42...like the others have said it is normal to have worries and be scared about surgery. I know I felt the same before my op back in June. In the ward I was in I had two lovely ladies who had theirs the day before me and they were great at chatting to me and kept my mind off what I was waiting for. Have a chat with some of the nurses and they might give you something just to keep you calm :-) will be thinking about you tomorrow xxx vanda",

I just had double mastectomy and lymph mode clearance, but unfortunately the cancer has spread into my spine. I have started hormone treatment, had my first injection and start my tablets in a few weeks. Soo many questions to ask and unless i write them down i forget by the time i go to see my bc nurse lol... I havent posted alot on here but im on nearly everyday reading everyone elses posts and i agree with so many that you have to try and keep a positive mental attitude but its not always easy!!! Whenever i waken during the night and cant get back to sleep, thats when my mind thinks all sorts ie how will my partner manage without me and my 8yr old daughter and my 2 sons!! Sorry for ranting...i only came on to ask about scented stuff lol... Hugs to you all from.....Tigger (aka Vanda) xx",
