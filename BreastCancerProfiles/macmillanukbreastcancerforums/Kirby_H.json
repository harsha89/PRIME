      "Content": "Hello I am new to the group after many months searching the Internet without success of finding away of losing weight while on Tamoxifen.   I excerise three times a week eat well and I still can't loose the extra 1.5 stones I gained over the last year . I am embrassed to consult my doctor as I know how lucky I am to have recovered so well and in the great scheme of things it's not that big but I have lost confidence and cover up all the time which my daughter says makes me look bigger. I get hot flushes to the point of wetting through my many layers. I heard that Apple cider vinager and raspberry kitones will help but I am scared of combining with tamoxifen  Can anyone help ",
