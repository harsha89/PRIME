      "Content": "Hi, I'm on 3rd cycle of 6 FEC, I used the cold cao for the first 2 but started loosing gobbets of hair after the second. To such an extent I looked like a VERY devout monk! Always thought that this would be the hardest thing for me but found when the time came I was totally up for shaving it all of as it couldn't be worse than the wisps I had left. I've had nothing but positive comments, a lovely wig if I feel the need and great scarves... Which by the way make you look tots glam! Theirs always a silver lining if you look hard enough. Xx",

      "Content": "Hi lisa88, if you take paracetamol you need to take your temperature first as you don't want it to mask a temperature which might indicate an infection. Also your toothbrush should be soft, or even extra soft. I've seen on some other threads that it has been recommended to change your toothbrush for each cycle. Some people have also suggested sucking on ice pops or ice lollies, bought or home made during the chemo to try and prevent mouth ulcers. I think, on the principle of the cold cap! Hope this helps xx Penny",

I hadn't long replied to another lovely lady on here about Paxman shampoo and conditioner and we had been given the very good advice to friend each other to give personal details.....I managed to skip the .....yes please , I'd love to give a good home to your lovely head gear as the cold cap isn't being as successful as I had hoped, I haven't lost all my hair ( I've had my 2nd cycle of FEC and cold cap Tuesday just gone) but it is coming out at an alarming rate so just want to be prepared for DAILY bad hair days if it continues. I'm on 6 FEC and am just realising that this is really going to make the Paxman work for its money! Yours hopefully Penny.....Hugs",
