      "Content": "Every time I post something on here, the replies I get remind me that I'm not the only one facing all this.  I also went on my own for the results last monday, as I couldn't believe I could possibly have cancer.  It was a bit of a shock when I realised I was seeing a surgeon and the Macmillan nurse was there too.  I get the results of the WLE and sentinel lymph node biopsy on 22nd April - the day before my birthday. Pants!! D xx",

      "Content": "This feels so weird. I had my diagnosis 6 days ago, and am for WLE on 5.4.16 but haven't cried. Not once.  A few people I have told have then burst into tears. But I still haven't cried.  Came close a few times. Once when I walked into Maggies at Clatterbridge and the second time when the M&S woman was so unhelpful.  Is this normal?",
