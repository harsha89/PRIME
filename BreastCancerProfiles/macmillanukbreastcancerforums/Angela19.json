      "Content": "Hi everyone Wondered if anyone else had had this. My results after the lumpectomy were that the cancer was ER+. Started chemo, then got the Oncotype DX results which state the cancer is ER-, making it Triple Negative. I am seeing the oncologist on Monday but am anxious. Either one is wrong, but which one? Or it is possible for one sample to yield both results depending on which bit of the lump each lab got. Anyone else had this? Iam really anxious that I am getting the right chemo if this is TN, at the moment I am on FEC 75 with no Taxane based drugs in the mix. Really grateful for any experiences out there!",

      "Content": "It is confusing isn't it? If the hospital one is wrong, how confident can I be in their analyis of my sentinel node which they declared clear? What really got me was that when my surgeon ( who told me I was ER+) phoned to talk me through the results of the Oncotype DX he hadn't even picked up that they said ER-. When I pointed it out he couldn't get off the phone quick enough, and told me to see the oncologist. It has been a big hit to my confidence in my medical team, I do hope they can give me big reassurance!",
