Like your wife I have appeared strong all the way through my treatment and I am sure it helps. It certainly isn't 'business as usual' throughout treatment ( or after) but feeling positive did help me. With your support your wife will be able to work her way up the mountains she needs to climb. This is a great website with loads of support. She will need some pjs that button down the front for hospital and for duvet days that she is bound to need. Don't feel shy about asking for help, your friends will be more than happy to know they are doing something to help. My favourite help was friends calling in for a drink and natter, hubby always said he loved to hear me laughing when they visited. When your wife feels up to joining us she will find support and answers to her questions from those of us who already have that Brownie badge and others who are at a similar stage in their journey so they can support each other. I know it is really early but do look at booking a place on the Look Good Feel Better sessions ( see discussion post) they are fantastic and the goodie bag is great too. Take care",

My friend is a distric nurse and she told me to be careful with ibrubrufen (Woops not sure on spelling) as it can cause ulcers and she said to always take it with food. My GP has given me an ibrubrufen gel that I apply directly to the areas of pain. This works well.

Again this is quite normal and being left with as little moob whilst the Seroma drains itself by slowly re plumbing the lymph system. I had my mx in October , tell Mum to do her exercises religiously especially if rads are her next treatment as she will need to be able to raise her arm above her head during the zapping. Soft vests are great. Personally I prefer to wear soft bras and camisoles that hold a falsie rather than a bra as I still find them uncomfortable after a few hours. Hope my ramblings help.

The nurses will probably ask you to rate your pain on a scale of 1-10 and this will determine the pain relief they offer. Remembering to carry the drain around with you is the most frustrating part ( take a bottle shaped gift bag with you to the hospital to make it easier to move about) getting comfortable at night may take a few experiments, there have been previous discussions about heart shaped pillows. Compared to a c section and hysterectomy this operation is no where near as painful.I hope you remain calm and surgery goes well. Treat yourself to some new soft front fastening pjs that will be easy to remove whilst you regain your mobility. Take care Alison🎀",

When you do start to feel better don't start doing too much, use this time to let your body prepare itself for the next session. You next target is to make sure your blood test shows you are fit for treatment no 2. I used to be a very busy person with lots of commitments, since the start of my journey I have looked at what is important and have started to put myself first and what was hardest of all was asking for help.

Within 2 weeks I was driving and took my daughter to Birmingham to watch Disney on Ice. Please don't add extra worry about things that may not happen to you. Plan a few treats for yourself - a spot of retail therapy maybe? Some new pjs that button down the front, soft vest tops or soft bras will all be needed after your operation. Just think after your op the little blighter will no longer be with you ! Stay positive and don't worry about things that may not happen. This is only a short period of your life, albeit a not very nice part. Last year was hard but now I'm planning my summer holiday, I'm back at work part time and I've discovered just how many great friends I have. Take care",

Now I have a full covering of silver ( not grey\") short hair I am happy to go out without any covering up. In fact I love having short hair and don't plan to grow it as long as I used to wear it ( shoulder length bob). I can assure you you will not be stared at, in fact my hubby loves my new style. If it's good enough for Jessie J it's good enough for me! Give it a try, you will find it really does help with the temperature control. I finished my chemo 2nd September and only have a few pins and needles in my fingers now, even this is getting better daily although I still struggle with buttons on my blouse. I remember thinking why should the side effect seem to be getting worse now I have finished chemo! Good luck Alison",

You have found the right place for support, up to date knowledge and information, friendship and most importantly a place to let of steam with friends who really do know what you are feeling. The start of the journey is the hardest, it's a bit like riding a bike it's starts with a few wobbles before you quickly learn to peddle up hill. You will get lots of replies from forum members that are at the same stage as you and corn others who have completed treatments. Just a couple of tips always say yes please when help is offered people want to be useful and don't not use Google it is not the place to go searching.

I have had a hysterectomy and Caesarian section and can assure you a mastectomy with full lymph node removal is virtually pain free. Discomfort yes but there are lots of helpful tips on here. Someone suggest a heart shaped pillow to use at night. I have grade 4 with secondaries in my spine and almost all of my lymph nones were affected. If you met me today you wouldn't know there was anything wrong with me. In fact someone told me I look about 46 - not bad considering at 58 I'm only 3 years young than their mother! Keep smiling it can be done and is easier to do with a smile on your face. Do you have Facebook? If so look for Little Daisy Mae. Her father has reported on her daily progress when she was born at 25 weeks weighing less than 2 pounds. It is very humbling to see the weeks of heart ache they went through.

He told me to make a visual check of both arms by holding them in front of me and starting and the wrist compare each arm for difference in size. You would expect your dominant arm to be slightly larger. He then told me I could self refer at any time I became concerned. I would suggest you act sooner rather than later as what you are describing sounds like the checks he told me to carry our before referring myself. Hope this helps. He also gave me a few simple exercises to pump the arm to improve circulation. Take care",

She has her chemo on a Thursday and took 2 days holiday returning to work the following Monday. She had a wig in same style as her own hair and nobody knew she was having treatment. However, that is probably an extreme example. I managed to work from home for a few hours on 'good' days. I think you need to rest as much as possible during chemo, your body has a big fight ahead of it and you need to work with it by sleeping, resting eating and drinking lots of water. Hope this helps",

I also manage to find a falsie for swimwear and a new prosthetic boob that is a better fit than the one I was fitted with at the end of last year - that was £35 rather than £135.   The day I went for my fitting I was rather silly really - I didn't realise I needed to take a bra with me - I was still wearing soft vest tops!

It is almost a year since I started my treatment and 4 months since radiotherapy completed my journey ( except for Letrozole and the fun that brings with it). I am still shattered if I do too much. My definition of too much has changed too! I plan rest days where I do as little as possible on other days I plan one commitment only. This is the new me, the old me that dashed from here to there with my finger in lots of pies has gone for ever. What I have learnt is to pace myself, enjoy my friends and rest when I feel tired. Can you knit? I found that really useful as it made me sit down and gave me something to think about. I knitted blankets and cardigans for the charity Preemies UK following an peal by the parents of a very premature baby born locally. She has her own Facebook page.

I understand that it is a very expensive drug, presumably that is why it is only used at start of each treatment. I think the only advice I can give is listen to your body, sleep whenever you feel the need, eat what you fancy and don't worry if you really don't want to eat much. I had some days when I ate very little, on other days I could have eaten the table leg I was so hungry! This forum is a great place to meet new friends who know exactly what you are going through. I have gained my chemo and mastectomy badges and start work on my radiotherapy badge on Monday. Chin up you can do this, you are probably past the worse part of this cycle. Have a look at previous postings for lots of tips. Have you tried pineapple to help with the vile taste in your mouth?

I drove myself to these appointments, it was about a 45 minute drive each way plus allowing extra time to find a parking space at busy times! ( early morning appointments are best if you can cope with the early start). In my area we have a charity that will drive you to these appointments so that might be another possibility for you to explore. Rads is by far the easiest part of the journey especially if you can rest after each session. Hope this is helpful",

My daughter has coloured my hair with a 6/8 wash colour (£2.59 from Home Bargains) and I am pleased with the results although it doesn't last long as I don't bother with a shower cap so it gets washed every day.

A holiday may be just what you need as something to look forward to. So long as you listened to your body and rest/ sleep when you need to. The trouble is we all like to be super woman, however I would think if you promised to let your family wait on you hand and foot you would probably cope with the holiday. Until you have started your chemo you won't know how you are going to cope. My surgeon told me about one of her patients who travelled to the West Mids on a Thursday for her chemo, took the Friday as holiday and returned to her high flying post in the City on the Monday and nobody knew she was having chemo! Well I think my rambling is really saying we are all different in how we cope. A holiday as a short term goal sounds good. Presumably if you and hubby didn't go at the last minute everyone else would still go and occupy the cottages? Take care Alison💝",

This time last year I had very bad back ache and was having physiotherapy, little did I know that this was linked to the lump in my breast. When I started chemo in May I struggled to get out of bed, dress, even get on and off the toilet. As soon as I started chemo my movement improved. The Letrozole tablets are my best hope of keeping the mets contained. So to me a few pains in my joints are a small price to pay. I manage the pain with cocodamol tablets and a laxative to counteract their side effects.... Sounds like the song about the old lady who swallowed a fly!, like me I am sure you will be carefully monitored. Hope this helps.",

Here university have been very supportive they have said they will pay her fare home when ever she needs to visit me. Her friend was offered similar support last year with train fares to return home each week end. It might be worth him investigating. I finished my 6 rounds of chemo yesterday and see my breast surgeon on Monday to discuss the next steps. This is great site for positive help, support, tips and hugs. I have found many helpful tops and seeing your post made me join as I felt I could add a helpful tip for you. Take one day at a time, spoil yourself with small treats! Alison. 💝🎀💖",

This site is a great support for you and your mother, here you will find friends who can give you advice based on their experiences. Is mum having chemotherapy? Perhaps you could paint her nails with a black polish ( see earlier discussions) and maybe do yours as well as a sign of your support. You tube is great for learning how to tie headscarves, use make up to fake eyebrows... As you both make your way along this journey you will both discover who your real friends are.

I am not triple neg but am at stage 4.  I think you need to take the advice of your team who will offer you the best treatment plan for your body.  it is early days, take one step at a time, there is still lots of time to discuss options.  I'm coping well with my lop sided body and doubt if I will go ahead with reconstruction next year.  This is a journey that needs taking in small fairy steps - it will still get you to the top of the mountain!

I now have monthly injections to strengthen my spine and the Letrozole to limit any further damage. It is all very doable and with a young family you really do need to,accept all offers of help, if you decline people don't always offer again My friend turned up one Sunday and did all my ironing for me whilst we nattered. Neighbours cooked for hubby whilst I was in hospital and another friend will knock the door and take our dog for a walk. This is a great place to be honest about our feelings and a place where occasionally we are told to pull ourselves together and prepare for battle! Just look at your children and that will give you the strength you need. I dreaded my MRI scan, I visualised my daughter's wedding that I intend being around for whenever she finds Mr Right!

Paint your nails black - there are lots of threads in these discussions (fingers and toes) Sleep / rest / listen to your body Ask for mouth wash - I was given Diflam and told it contained a local anaesetic and gargle with it as soon as my throughout felt sore Dont refuse any offers of help - friends may not offer again if you say no first time Pineapple is good for a sore mouth - again lots of links in previous chats Candy Crush - very addictive and good when awake in the middle of the night an ipad or tablet is really useful to while away the hours - the Daily Mirror is free to download on week days and is available form around 5 am No sunshine without factor 50 sunscreen And finally remember you have a great support network here on this site - someone is usually around at any hour f the day or night!

I had my mastectomy 3 weeks ago and it is not a painful operation - presumably veins in your legs could be used if necessary. You might find it useful to increase the amount of iron rich foods in your diet before your operation, my red blood cell count was a little low and they retested me after my operation with a view to giving me a blood transfusion. 'Luckily' I managed to get away with a month's supply of iron tablets. I am now on Letrozole and will start radiotherapy in a few weeks time. I am hoping that all my sessions will be completed by Christmas.

You will find some excellent practical advice from 'experts' who are already on this vile journey and others who have completed theirs and are living a new 'normal' life. I wished I has the support from my sister, she fell out with me 17 years ago! A normal healthy diet with lots of fresh fruit and vegetables and avoiding processed foods is a sensible start. Your sister is at the hardest part of the journey - the unknown! Once her treatment plan has been drawn up and she starts her treatment you will both feel relieved that the battle to kill the cancer cells has begun. The best advice that I can give is keep away from google stick to sites such as this one and breast cancer care. Once her treatment has been sorted you will find lots of tips on this forum, it is also a great place for your sister to access when she is feeling low, she will find lots of 'sisters' and a few brothers who will boost her moral. Like your sister my cancer had spread into my lymph nodes. Encourage her to remain positive breast cancer is curable / treatable. Big hugs to you both Alison💝",

It is very hard for our nearest and dearest - there is no support for them, no rule book and sometime whatever they try to do for us it is wrong! My hubby has taken the dog out to keep out of my way as he realises tonight he can't do Anything right!! So remember this is only a very short time give chemo the chance to do its job.

I have driven myself to the hospital every day (45 mins) I have negotiated morning sessions as car parking is a lot easier. The staff are friendly and make the experience as pleasant as possible. I take a short dressing gown rather than struggle with the hospital gowns. I have not had any skin problems ( so far) and have used a cream my daughter bought in France ( Biafine) the radio therapist commented on how well my skin was coping - being fair skinned I did worry I might burn. The travelling is probably the hardest / tiring part especially if you get an early appointment, mine are at 8.45 next week with Christmas Day and Boxing Day off ( I have mores time off when working!) Hope this helps. I also had an appointment to see the physio to discuss how to detect / prevent lymphodaema. I hope your D sessions go well, my feet became swollen and I had to go out in my slippers!

I will see how it works out throughout my rads but after week 1 my skin does not look any different to what it was before treatment. I will comment again at the end of my treatment for anyone who may be interested. My hubby is inCornwall with my Mother, he has told her about me and explained why we didn't tell her sooner. After the initial shock she understood my reasoning. What a relief now I no longer have to be careful what I say to her on my daily phone calls. Think of me at my 8.45 am appointments this week, I'm dropping my daughter at the supermarket to do our Christmas food shop whilst I have my treatment. Hope I don't go home without her! Have a good and relaxing Christmas Alison",

Sooooo on Monday hubby took the whole morning off work, we travelled to a new hospital after a long wait I had a short chat with the consultant, corrected her as to which side was to be treated, I then signed the consent and left! What a waste of time I could have done that at my last appointment with the oncologist. Like you I threw my dummy out of the pram! Chemo is doable so long as you lists to your body and say yeas please whenever somebody offers help ( even if you can do it yourself).

I did find it was linked to weight gain and took this as a sign to get some weight off. I wasn't overweight but going a little over seemed to trigger the mastitis. I have heard from a friend ( a gynao surgeon) that his wife was advised to wear a Wonderbra to 'cure' her mastitis. This advice was from my breast surgeon who I have great faith in. So... Whist you are waiting for your results why not give it a try! Worrying always makes the pains worse. It's like when a period is late we convince ourselves we must be pregnant. Take care Alison",

Hats and scarves were much easier and topless around the house. A tip I learnt was keep a hat by the front door so you don't shock the postman!!!!!!

Mum will be given lots of leaflets to bring home at the start of each stage, they are very informative. Take each treatment as it comes, do your research ( not google) bit at a time. Members on this forum have been a great support for me, I have learnt more from this site than from my oncologist. Alison",

Although it's not a 'Walk in the park' this operation is not painful.  The theatre team will look after you with even extra care.  The anaesthetic  will be fine - one minute you all be chatting to the theatre staff the next 'minute' you will be in the recovery room.  Within hours I was sitting up having a cup of tea and sandwiches.  The nil by mouth was the hardest part!  Bug cyber hugs - you will be fine, let us know how you get on.  Have you got a little bag you can use to carry your drain in?  I used a gift bag meant for a wine bottle.  Others have used over the shoulder bags - saves leaning it behind when you get up to the bathroom!",

I have been a member of this forum for the last 6 months and have read many accounts of 'men' running away from our situations. This doesn't make it any easier for you, hopefully in the not too distant future you will look back and think thank goodness I'm not with that ****** any more (use your own adjective). You could talk to your BCN who will be able to direct you to local support groups. You could also find a Looking Good Feeling Better course. I am sure that you will get many replies and tales of similar ******* I had my mastectomy in October and am just about to complete my rads on Wednesday. I have been left with a very saggy boob and for the first time in my life wished I had been less well endowed! just remember there is always someone worse off than you. Hold your head high, you are a survivor and who know what is around the corner... Put the kettle on and have a cuppa, bar of chocolate, or whatever is your favourite comfort food. Then hit the shops a new handbag always make me feel better! Chin up you can deal with this, Alison🎀",

      "Content": "Hi Stoksie. Letrozole does an excellent job even though it has it's side effects. I would ask for a scan because you are getting yourself worked up and that automatically makes the pain worse. Unfortunately GPs have budgets! Their diagnosis is a bit woolly. I went to my GP with back pain, the first he told me to take cocodamol and it might be shingles. The second time I returned I was told the base of my spine was out of line and was referred to a physiotherapist. When she saw me she immediately said I had the spine of a 70 year old (I am 57) and gave me exercises that were so painful / impossible to do. On the third visit to the doctor I showed her the puckering around my nipple and was referred to the rapid response unit. Unfortunately for me the cancer had spread to my spine. So what I am saying is go with your gut feeling, ask for a scan and this will put your mind at ease. The aches and pains associated with Letrozole are part and parcel of the treatment , however you have noticed a change in the side effects and I think you have given it long enough. I hope my story hasn't made you feel worse but has given you the support to become more assertive with your GP. Take care",

We are all such good actors and manage to put on a brave face in front of friends and family when underneath we are petrified. I had my mx in October, it is not a particularly painful operation and the nurses will offer you pain relief. In my hospital they asked me to grade the pain from 1-10 and this determined the medication they administered. Have you been out and bought yourself some new pjs? I chose some soft ones that buttoned up the front for easy access. Take a small bag (gift bag for bottle of wine) to put your drain in when you move around. Some people in previous posts have said they have been provided with a bag made by volunteers. The helpline may be able to give you dome guidance to support your daughter's reaction. I sometime feel it must be harder for those closest to us as they don't get much support and have so many emotions to deal with. And in my hubby's case he has had to learn how to use the washing machine! He still struggles with the induction hob and timers on the oven!!! Bless him!",

Here are my suggestions to increase your list:- I have not seen anyone mention Udderly Smooth hand cream I was given this by my chemo nurse along with the Difflam mouth wash. The cream is great for dry hands, feet, knees and any other areas that dry out. The cream was developed for cows to prevent their udders from cracking! I would add hand massages to the list ( and pedicures) as this seemed to help calm my hand where the drip was inserted and they are very therapeutic. Holland and Barrett sell natural deodorants as ordinary ones should be avoided after hair loss. My best advice is to say yes please to anyone who offers to help out and most importantly listen to your body, sleep whenever you need to. Alison",

Don't rush to buy proper bras, however you will need on before you go for you prosthetic fitting. I still wear my soft bras as they were comfortable during radiotherapy and even afterwards as I am still a little swollen and don't want to wear anything tight. I started a discussion with links for the genie bras I wear they come with a pocket to take a small foam liner Nd I can get my prosthetic breast in there too. Hope this helps. I also found lots of mastectomy bras on amazon - I am quite an unusual size so have to shop around, they are returnable meaning you can try them on at home. Sainsburys also have a good range of soft / sports bras and think it is one of their 25% off promotions at the moment ( also great for pjs). Happy shopping!",

      "Content": "My hair dropped out within 2 weeks of my first FEC session. It got to the stage where I couldn't prepare a meal without dishing up hairs! My hubby persuaded me to let him shave it with his clippers and it felt so much better. I have a wig that I find hot to wear. I wear hats and scarves when I go out and have never felt that anyone is staring at me. At home I tend to go bare headed , remembering to leave a hat by the front door for when unexpected callers knock the door. I forgot this once and wondered why the delivery man had a funny expression on his face. I am a Brown Owl and have had to explain my treatment to them. I compared myself to Jessie J and they now think that Brown Owl is cool! My hair seems to be growing back during my last 2 taxotere sessions I feel this may be due to leaving my head uncovered most of the time. You will know when it is the right time for you to face the clippers - we are all different! Think of the time it will save! There is always a positive for every negative Alison",

I have found I have less side effect with TEVA manufactured tablets and now ask for this make when I take my prescription into the chemist. I haven't felt weepy but certainly ache more with some brands. I hope this may help. Having a 17 year old is hard work, my daughter was quite trying at that age.

I am now on Letrozole, a daily Adcal tablet to boost my calcium levels and every 4 weeks I have an injection of demozifab ( I think that's the right spelling!). I use co codamol to control the pain and take. Daily laxative to counteract the side effects of the pain killers. So long as I take it easy I can manage many activities. I don't bend down, stretch or lift any more than I have to. I know when I have done too much - usually hubby tells me I am looking pale and he makes me go to bed. I now sleep on my back - I used to put pillows either side of me to make sure I couldn't roll over in my sleep. I have a portable 'Back Friend' that I take out with me so the I am comfortable when sitting in 'strange' chairs. Feel free to friend me. Remember this can be controlled just listen to your body.

I don't suppose Mum will have all the answers yet!  At the start of this journey we don't have the full picture of the actual cancer - tests are carried out after Mum's biopsy.  Like you Mum I decided to have a mastectomy in the hope that I gave myself the best chance and to make sure that I would not need further surgery.  I had a fairly large lump so had chemo first to reduce its size and improved the chances of the surgeon being able to remove the entire mass.  Radiotherapy is like the cleaning up process - mopping up any stray cells that may have been left. My daughter is a little older than you (20) and when I was first diagnosed I kept it from her a she was about to start her exams at the end of her second year at university.  Grace came with me to one of my chemotherapy sessions and the breast care nurse was able t answer her questions.  I loved it when she snuggled up in bed with me and asked the questions she wanted to ask. You will be able to give your Mum so much practical support, Grace helped me to look my best when I went out by doing my makeup and styling my wig.  She can now cook a brilliant Sunday roast AND best of all cleans up afterwards.   I hope this helps, I'm sure much of this is still very new to your Mum and she probably doesn't know all the answers.  If you look at our recent posts you can see that we are a very caring and supportive group that will help you and Mum with many of the practicalities she is going to face in the next few months.   I am sure my daughter would be happy to friend you on Facebook.  Take care, give Mum lots of hugs and support.   Take care",

I couldn't see the point in paying for a trip to the hairdresser when it was going to fall out - I have been married to a Yorkshireman for too long!!!!!! My hair started to fall out after the first session, and my scalp itched like mad, my hair ended up in a tangled clump that I couldn't brush out so I got the scissors and chopped it out. Hubby then clipped it all off and it felt so much better. I didn't wear my wig very often - it was too hot in the summer. I have a huge selection of hats and scarves. My favourite was from eBay. As George said yesterday there are lots of people making money out of us and as soon as you google chemo and hat / scarf the prices double!!!! I did buy a half wig to wear under hats and scarves, so that some hair shows. I now have a short hair style and vey much doubt I will grow it long again. Take care. Search some older posts using key words you will find links for hats, scarves, nails....",

My sister in Law is a head teacher in South Kirby. Take care, and a chill pill. I am enjoying having time to do all the lovely things I never had time to do when I was working too many hours every week. This week I am decorating eggs for my Easter tree. Last week included 2 lunches and an evening meal with friends. As they say ' take time to smell the roses!' One of my friends has decided to slow down since spending time with me especially during chemo, she says she realised she enjoyed just sitting and talking without dashing around like a lunatic.

I'm on Letrozole so loosing the pounds may take a bit longer. Gillie B had a great tip to count down your radiotherapy sessions. Fill a large jar with small chocolate bars, one for each session. When you get home after each session eat one! If chocolate doesn't float your boat you could have a long row of wine bottles. Travelling to and from your sessions is the tiring part. Have you stocked up on Simple shower gel? Huge hug hope you update us tomorrow. Can you knit or crochet? It's very therapeutic and stops me from nibbling food.",

Lots of friends told me I should tell her but I always responded by telling them she couldn't do anything to help and would worry herself so much and probably make herself more ill.
