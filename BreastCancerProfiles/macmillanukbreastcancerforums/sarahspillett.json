    "Content": "Hi all I've been asked by my Consultant if I would like to take part in the Persephone trial, the one that sees if giving you Herceptin for 6 months instead of 12 is effective. I am not sure whether to do it or not, my six months treatment is up tomorrow so I haven't got long to decide and am really confused about what to do and could do with your help. Is there anyone out there also on the trial? Sarah x",
