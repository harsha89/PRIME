Mine took it in their stride, but to them cancer is not as scary a word as it is to us.   You will get through this, and you'll find strength that you never realised you had xx",

Now because I am having bilateral mastectomy and immediate reconstruction, the surgeon has said it will be 4-6 weeks before surgery can be scheduled (he has a holiday coming up). He suggested that as my cancer is aggressive I should start chemo first and get that done  rather than waiting weeks with no protection. This will give the surgeon plenty of time to schedule my op at the end of the year.  So at my appointment I had the marker fitted to the tumour and an echocardiogram. I feel like my head is spinning and I am so scared.  Meeting oncologist next week and will probably start chemo the week after.  Any advice gladly taken!! ",

Really emotional and sad. The wait for results is obviously really stressful, but this 'sadness' has really knocked me. Got the kids to school and just cried all the way home. I don't know whether to cry and let it out or whether that will make me worse? People constantly contacting me asking if I've had any results yet, I just want to scream at them to leave me alone, then I feel terrible because I know they are only concerned about me and I should be more understanding of their feelings. But if I get one more text asking 'how are you feeling today?'.....I think I'll scream! I have no idea how I feel so how can I possibly say? The standard 'fine thanks' is getting more difficult to type. Thanks for listening xxx Nicola",
