      "Content": "Hi Descat, I have just been told I have borderline malignant phyllodes after waiting over 6 weeks  for my results from my last surgery. I'm due to have more surgery next week. I have also found that there is little information out there about them. I think because it is quite rare there hasnt been so much research done on it.  My surgeon cant tell me what will happen during surgery as he isnt sure what he will find. He is hoping to do breast reconstruction at the time but has also warned that he may not be able to and there is also a chance I will have a masectomy but wont know until I come round. I will have had 4 surgeries in 18 months, previously removing fibroadeanoma's (11 in total) and I was never made aware that it could lead to phyllodes, I suppose because it is rare. Hope this helps.",

      "Content": "Hi JollyG, good to hear that you have surgery soon and hopefully you will feel more comfortable in time. I've just found a new lump 7 weeks after surgery to remove 7 PT and fibrodeanomas. Had biopsy done today but they cant tell which one it is that has come back. Its only small at the moment which is good. I'm considering asking for a mastectomy  as I have already have 4 surgeries in the last 18 months for this and I really cant face the thought of this being an ongoing thing. My only concern is that it is close to the chest wall and whether having a mastectomy would work or if it is in the chest wall and still continue to happen. I have a week and a bit to think about it but it is really getting me down now and I don't know what to do. I know no one has the answers as the doctors don't know why it keeps happening but that isn't much help when it is you it is happening to. Sorry for the ranty post but I have no one to talk to about it. Thank you",
