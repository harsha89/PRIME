      "Content": "Hello, I really am just looking for any recommendations about information you think that I should read that will help me make my decision. I had a breast cancer lump removed last week and all of my lymph nodes.  I haven't seen my oncologist yet but the surgeon and cancer nurse have made it clear that chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy will almost certainly be his recommendation.  I have grade 3, medullary, invasive cancer, that has spread to 1/25 lymph nodes,  The cancer lump was 23mm. I just want to know really whether I really do have a decision to make in all this about whether to accept the chemotherapy.  It seems that the conventional wisdom would strongly say to me that I should follow the recommendations.  I know that there is an awful lot out there that says that chemo is bad, doesn't work ect - but I haven't really found anything yet that convinces me - but it is so hard on the internet to filter what you find.  I just wanted to know if there is anything logical that offers another view about reason I might refuse, things I should consider. Before they removed all my lymph nodes I did try to get them to explain - why all and not just a sample - they said it was because a biopsy had shown cancer in a lymph node.  I now know that it was only in 1 and all 25 were removed.  I am sure that they did what they thought was necessary but I can't help feeling that perhaps just taking a sample of lymph nodes would have been better for my body but that their approach is based on being aggressive towards the cancer first. At the moment all I am sure of is that I am afraid of the damage of chemotherapy might do to me and I don't know if there is anything I can do to sensibly try and weigh up this risk of the damage chemo is likely to do to my body versus the risk of the cancer being somewhere else/coming back.  Let me know if anyone has any suggestions for me. Thanks Laura",

      "Content": "Hello, I just wondered if anyone else had come across the fairly big differences in risk predictions/prognosis between Adjuvant Online (the one that my oncologist used to print out my stats) and lifemath,net.  For me the mortality without treatment from AO was 5/10 and LM 2/10.  I have been strongly recommended chemo (TAC) followed by RT.  I have looked at the validity of both prediction tools and I understand that AO is the one recommended by NICE but the data/formula used on LM seem very impressive/robust. I understand that in either case CT will increase my chances of survival/reduce risk of reoccurrence but for me, and I know that this is a very personal decision/choice,  the difference in the stats of this degree would influence my decision. Can anyone help?   Laura",

      "Content": "No you can't do it yourself online, I asked the oncologist to print the details out for me.  However you can access Predict http://www.predict.nhs.uk/predict.shtml which uses much of the same formula and data as Adjunctive Online.  Hope this helps - although I am beginning to doubt how all this helps make the decision, especially if the medical advice is strongly suggesting adjunctive therapy.  God luck with whatever you are looking for.  Laura",

      "Content": "Hello, Just to let you know that I had all my lymph nodes removed from the left side on 7th August 2012. I remember the surgeon telling me that there could be numbness do still have the numbness now, about a month later but it gets less numb every week, with slightly more feeling. I did have very mild pins and needles at first but I don't get this anymore. I do find the exercises and keeping the arm working as much as normal, especially once the drain was out, does help. However I have had days where I just rested it too, if things were a bit achy, if I felt a bit nervous of the scar pulling or I just couldn't face being reminded and this didn't do me any hard me either, the odd day. The day after if anything I could stretch further and felt more motivated to exercise it. This is all just my experience though and you can always ask the breast care nurse - that is what they are they for. Take care Laura",
