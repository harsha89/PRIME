      "Content": "Hi girls, just a quick question, I'm having my check up tomorrow and you were all so helpful and eased my mind with my rib pain question I thought I'd ask about this. I've noticed this past month or so that my skin is a fair bit thicker and from what I can feel gradually thickening as the weeks pass on. It's the skin on the underside of my breast. It's the right side where I had my bc. But I'm not sure if its directly where the cancer was... As strangely enough I'm not actually sure the exact position of where the cancer was. I do plan on asking that tomorrow, they went in under my arm and round my nipple to get at it and I never thought to get then to point or where about it was... Anyway. I'm just wondering if any of you have had the same? It could be that I'm only beginning to feel that area again as my arm was numb for a long time where they cut my nerves to get at my lymph nodes. Thanks very much for your help. Elaine xxx",

It's very easy to catastrophise on every ache and pain after experiencing what we have gone through. More than often it is not the case. Thanks again for your advice girls. Keep well xx",

I thought that would be on my arm, yes its still really swollen from the rads as after the wle it had gotten quite a bit smaller than pre op and had a delve in it where the lump was excised and sunk in. Forgot to say J, hope you are keeping well and you too Julia, will let you know what they say. Thanks again xxx",

Cutting a long story short I realised I was trying to do too many things at once and after having a melt down with my boss decided to reach out and spoke to my bcn who referred me to a clinical psychologist. She made me realise that I needed to concentrate more on how I'm feeling and give myself a break for feeling that way rather than trying to make myself feel the way I thought I should be feeling. Once I got my head around that I felt like a huge weight was lifted off my shoulders.   From what I've seen from the others and myself your feelings are normal so give yourself a break from all the pressure and take each day as it comes and if you feel that work is an added pressure then revisit your decision to go back.

Been on it for about a month and a half and it seems to be working to help me with hot flushes and sweats but I've just had a thought as to whether they will counteract the tamoxifen as I've heard that you shouldn't take some things with tamoxifen.  Is this one of those things? I've looked at the nutritional info and nothing jumps out at me but can't quite remember what was on the list vitamin wise that I shouldn't be taking?  Would love to hear your thoughts.  Thanks Elaine x",

      "Content": "Hi Alice, sorry to hear your results weren't clear. Hope these next few weeks pass quickly for you so that you can get the op over and done with. How true you are with your unluckily lucky grade one result comment. I too was grade one, had my wle 20mm invasive & 15 nodes removal at the end of march and am on tamoxifen for 10 years as I was 37. Just make sure that you don't bottle anything in. It is great that we both got it 'early' but you are still going through one of the hardest things that life throws at us. I approached it with a chin up, I'm lucky its early, there are people who are much more unfortunate than me attitude, worked throughout and to some extent that survival mode helped me get through it. But then in September it all crashing down on top of me and I realised crickey did that really happen?! No one understands more than the lovely ladies on this site, use it to get you through this horrible time, I've found it invaluable. Sending you a big hug and positive thoughts and am always here if you need to rant.   Elaine xxx",

      "Content": "Hi JPL, firstly never apologise for saying how you feel, you're not 'going on', it definitely helps to get it out and if it helps at all you just described exactly how I felt at that point in time too. Waiting in between the op and the radiotherapy is such a scary time. You don't know what the radiotherapy is, what it will do. You're still tender from the op... You're emotions are on a rollercoaster twisting and turning on a daily basis and all you want to do is get off the ride. You didn't mention if you're taking any hormone tablets but if you are they can mess with you're head too. The radiotherapy isn't as daunting as what I was initially worried about, it's doesn't hurt at all and staff are lovely and very approachable about any worries you may have. Hope it goes well for you and come back and let me know how you're getting on. Big hugs Elaine Xxxo",
