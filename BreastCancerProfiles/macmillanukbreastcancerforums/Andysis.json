    "Content": "My 81 year old mother, with Alzheimer's, has been diagnosed with an oestrogen fed breast cancer.  Surgery is the usual option, but it has been decided by all involved that this would not be an appropriate course of action in her case.  She has been prescribed medication and will be reviewed in 6 months at clinic.  The Brest nurse tells me it is not at any particular 'stage'? Currently she has been diagnosed by biopsy and an ultrasound.  She was not able to cope with a mammogram, so I've no idea whether it has spread elsewhere etc.  I have told Mum of her diagnosis, but it registered for a matter of minutes and was gone.  She is generally fit and well in herself, but has lost a great deal of weight over the past couple of years.  Has anyone else had an experience like this with an elderly relative?  Generally feeling quite bemused by it all.  ",
