      "Content": "Hi , you are not alone at all. I am having my last round of chemo in 19th Jan and my was long black hair is now virtually gone and what is left is now white though I am 47 . I have also gained just over a stone have a fat tomatoe face and feel really ugly and not at all like a woman so see your just normal , u wear dresses and makeup but feel like a drag queen  I feel you pain and trust me I am a hairdresser so really do get it . I really hope once my chemo is over this blubber goes away because I'm so swollen I also wish you all the very best . You can buy in eBay or Amazon an oil ..it's called Jamaican black castor oil and it's fab for hair and works a treat once you have some to work with it will strengthen it and encourage fullness it smells but worth it . I leave mine in all day and then wash off before bed .  Good luck  Bev  X",

Shopping when we like , snoozing in a beach sounds blissful to me !  Hahaha you made me chuckle with the waiter bit , it's amazing how during treatment we lose these feelings hey , but when you are single I guess you kind of get used to that .  Glad to hear your hip will be sorted , more adventures for you coming up then ?  Xx",

After reading up on the drug and reading what other takers say I have been left totally devastated !! I can't stop crying and feel like my life is not worth it anymore . The thought of going through similar side effects to chemo ( hair falling ,weight gain, sickness , flushes ) 10 years of that I don't want to face . My chemo was nasty to me and I had every side effect possible including burns down below and in arms and hands , gained two stone and full of fluid that won't budge , I was thinking at least I'm near the end but then to be hit with that news about Tamoxifen I'm filled with absolute dread and don't know what to do but cry .",
