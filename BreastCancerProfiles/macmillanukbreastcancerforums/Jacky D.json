      "Content": "Thank you everyone... sorry I am new to this site and not sure how it all works! I had further mammograms to confirm I have Calcification which is fine so long as it doesn't cluster apparently... I have 5 bits close together with another 5 at satellite points on the scan and it just depends what those 10 particals decide to do next! Bit of relief for now but basically to early to know for sure. Consultant was very thorough and reassuring too with a bit of a plan for the future. I can't believe how this has really shaken me up and caused issues at home but I'm sure that this is normal? ! Don't think I have ever felt so alone :-( x",

Only to get a call today (monday), wanting me back in tomorrow (tuesday) for more scans as something has been picked up from the images! Is this common or am I just unlucky?",
