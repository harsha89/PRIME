      "Content": "Hello Dream thief thank you for replying , I will  deffinatly have a look at the groups, although the surgeon has been ,more than helpful explaing evey thing, you can't have enough back up information, especially from those who have had similar,   she did explain to me ,how the angio Sarcoma ,was from the radiotherapy I received in June 2011, I dont like to bandy this about ,as feel it could unnecessarily worry, those who are set to have it,   already Ive taken heart from others ,saying how tired they feel and rather low in spirit they feel, wish you a good Sunday  sewsandy xxx",
