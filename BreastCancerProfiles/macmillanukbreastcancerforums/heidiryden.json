      "Content": "Hi. I had a wide local excision and sential lymph node biopsy last week.  I received the results last night that my lymph nodes tested positive for cancer cells ( 3 out of 4). I'm going back in next week for clearance of all the nodes.  Previous scans showed no cancer in my organs or bones.  I've had 8 sessions of chemo already.  Im so scared I'm going to die very soon. Think I'm in shock!  How much does this increase my chances of the cancer spreading? I'm scared to look online and I didn't ask the consultant as I just wanted to get home last night. Thanks heidi t.     ",

      "Content": "Thank you . I feel much better after reading your replies. I am ER positive.  The chemo was to shrink the tumour down and it did a fabulous job ( the oncologist said) . Yes. Radiotherapy after the clearance.  I think I just got a shock and I panicked!  Thank you for taking the time to reply ... It has calmed me down and I'm going to enjoy the weekend. You're both very kind.    Heidi x",

      "Content": " Hi. First post!  I just need some reassurance. I have stage 3 breast cancer. I finished my 8th chemo on the 23rd July. I normally am starting to feel better by now but I still feel ill. Normally I'll have had one good day but I just feel awful and its getting me very down. Is it due to the accumulation of the chemo? Sorry to moan. Thanks heidi x",

I'm just scared and sick of feeling ill.  Anyway I'm lucky that I'm getting treatment and things will get better.      I hope you are well and happy. Thanks heidi      ",
