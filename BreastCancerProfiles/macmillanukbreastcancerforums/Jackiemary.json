    "Content": "Hiya,  I finished 12 sessions of folfox end of March this year. I had the oxaliplatin reduced after the first session due to side effect of severe diarrhoea.  After the tenth session the neuropathy side effects were so bad I was told that benefits of carrying on we're outweighed by the side effects so it was stopped. 5 months later I still have tingling fingers and my feet (sometimes from the knees down) are still painful and hurt to walk. However there does seem to be very slight improvements as time goes by so have fingers crossed that the nerves have not been permanently damaged, although I too was warned it could be permanent. Think it's just a waiting game, but have to remain positive j x",
