    "Content": "Hi I am a newbie at these posts but was looking for some help with the sore veins caused by FEC.  I have finished now with FEC and will be starting Docetaxel on September 22.   I was told by my Naturopathic Oncologist to rub on my arm at night Castor Oil to soften them.  I like the idea I read earlier in a post that to try e45 would help and the stretching.  I will try both of these.  I was shown some cold mitts and booties that the oncologists in Canada suggest to wear during the Docetaxel cycles to protect your nails and fend off the  neuropathy.  I fortunately did not have any nail issues with FEC.  Hopefully you could ask for the cold mitts and booties if that will help in FEC as well. For the chest discomfort from the Dexamethasone I am taking 1 hour before FEC and 1 pill/2x per day for 3 days following FEC, I was told to take an extra strength Tylenol which helps  Hopefully this may work for you.  The Tylenol also help for the Neupogen skeleton pain I get from these injections I get for 10 days following both the FEC and will be getting for the Docetaxel.   I have found the sun glasses work outside but did not think to use them in the inside as well.  I will start that tomorrow.   Dorthee did have some very good feedback and I always remember the strength of my prayers and the prayers of my family and friends.  The tend to calm me and give me the peace to carry on and try to help others from this challenging experience. Please  keep in touch and big hugs as we all survive and carry on. Love Canada Susan Love",
