      "Content": "Hi I am 46 and compared to most of you am probably the luckiest girl alive at the moment! They have just started a trial in our area for Women  aged 47-50 to be screened... There is lucky strike No.1 I am only 46 and got called..... 'Convinced I have the best guardian angel' Popped along as you do and thought nothing of it just that I wasn't going to miss the opportunity! Thank heavens I did. Got recalled for 2nd had to have Biopsy etc and yes you guessed I had a very deep seated lump only very small 1cm diameter. Got results which was probably the most surreal day of my life... No they have all been since... Organised surgery (lumpectomy) and Lymph node removal for 2nd august and out I trotted.... Had surgery on August 2nd all went well have 2 x 4' scars lump was seated right underneath and a left breast which is looking and feeling very sorry for it's self.. Went for results last Saturday and Lump removed and good clear margin though it had grown was invasive! and 2 nodes takes but they were clear, So I should i suppose be jumping for joy! shouldn't I? I haven't got to have chemo I don't think but do have to have radio and probably hormone see oncologist next week but here in lies my problem...... I just can't seem to get my head around amy of it! When this started I was fit, healthy and was feeling great had no real health problems and was enjoying life, No I feel as though I am living life in a bubble and going through some sort of out of body experinece as I had no physical signs and no lump to feel . Now I realise I think that had I never been called out of turn things could have been very different in 12 months - 3 years (Our trial area is random picks!) and for that I am very grateful but still here i am shocked and worried about the steps that come next and what do I say now even though I no the margins were clear and it wasn't yet on the move..... Any input or thought from you fabulous people would be amazing as you all know some if not all of these feelings. I am a fighter and don't let things bring me down but have to say head scramble at the moment is not good. ",

      "Content": "Hi Thanks for posting your question as it was one that was also so on my lips. So the replies you have received are helping me too... As I too like you start my radiotherapy soon. One tip I did pick up from another fellow on here was she had used 100% pure aloe vera straight after her treatment as well as the cream she was recommended to use and had found that really good at cooling the skin and helping irritation so I may also try that as well. get deliver to give anything a go if it makes it easier and more pleasant! Good luck with your next round of treatment hoe it goes as well as can be expected, Keep smiling we are winning. Love Emma xx",
