    "Content": "Hi all! Right now I don't know what to do or think and going out of my mind with worry. I am 25 years old and I found a lump in my right breast. I seen my GP and she confirmed there is a lump which is 4cm and mobile. She has referred me to the breast clinic which I am currently awaiting a phonecall for an appointment. There is strong family history of cancer in both sides with the latest one being my half sister who is currently in remission (thankfully). She was 30 when diagnosed which BC and under went surgery, chemo and radio. She was tested for the genetics gene and it was confirmed she has the BRCA 2 gene. At present my father is awaiting his appointment to test for this gene. I have a beautiful 5 year old daughter and right now all I can think about is her and what if! Thought I would post to see if anyone else can relate and guide me. Thank you all x",
