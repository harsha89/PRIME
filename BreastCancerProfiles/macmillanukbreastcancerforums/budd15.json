      "Content": "Hi.  I have stage 3b grade 3 invasive ductal carcinoma, HER2 +++, lymph node involvement and inflammatory breast cancer. I am 36 yrs old now and was diagnose din December 2015.  I am on EC-T and herceptin.  I have 2 more rounds of T left and 16 more herceptin injections left. I am now waiting for a letter to go see surgeon to discuss the mastectomy.  The issue I have is I would like them both removed as I really will not be able to live a normal life with only having one removed as I will always  e scared of every lump and bump I feel. I am having difficultly in convincing them to do a bilateral mastectomy.  I have suffered in the past with depression so severely at one point that I had a stay in hospital and I have done so much work to get a healthy mind and lead a normal life until the diagnosis.  Now it is on my files I am an anxious patient and being treated with appropriate medication I am on sleeping pills just so I actually sleep. I break down a lot. And now it's playing with my mind the fact they will only take one.  Has anyone else successfully managed to persuade them to do bilateral and can give me some advice as I will never live knowing it could happen all over again in the other one.  Please help me x",

      "Content": "Hi carolyn28 I will speak to one of the BCN  and I will also speak to a councillor if they fill that will be best.  I have been thinking of this non stop since December so by the time surgery happens it will have been 7-8 months I have been thinking about it.  I know I do not wish to be reconstructed with any part of my body as I just don't trust my body now.  Seems you went through a lot but are finally getting there and happy with how your progressing which is great.  Also sounds like you have a very understanding and caring surgeon as well.  Thank you so much for your advise it's appreciated Take care Hayley x",

My mum has also had it and had lumpectomy.  I know it really will damage me mentally if only one is removed. I'm so glad they listened to you in the end .  Take care  Hayley x",
