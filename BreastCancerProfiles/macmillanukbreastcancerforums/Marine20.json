I was 46 when I got diagnosed which is still young for cancer I was told because I'm sterilised I'm unlikely to get ovarian cancer  Which is a bonus As soon as you know your results then at least no matter what the outcome is we're all here for you. I really hope it is benine especially at your age. Good luck  Val x",

Please don't be scared about other pains around your body as I know exactlyhow you feel as I was exactly the same It started driving me insane wondering if it was anywhere else in my body  When I got the pathology results back and they told me they got all the tumor I felt so relieved  Everything will go through your head  If you keep doing that to yourself you will make yourself Ill with worry .

      "Content": "Hi karakeys  I wa diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma on 21st March.  It was really scary in the beggining  Not knowing what would happen  I was lucky it hadn't spread. It wasn't genetic either. I was the unlucky one in the family. I had 2 ops  First lumpectomy then they didn't get enough margin  Was going through chemo  Had my first 3 cycles then I was to go onto docetaxel. Which is the 2nd part of chemo. I couldn't handle chemo so I cancelled  But that was because I have other health problems that it had made worse. Plus with chemo I ended up with clots in both lungs. Which I give myself an injection every night.  Seemingly a lot of people get clots. It's natural. But not everyone gets them. Now I'm going to go through radiotherapy which I get my c.t scan tmrw to get things measured to see where they fire the beams. Getting told you have cancer is the scariest thing you'll ever hear but millions of people have gotten through it and so will you  Everyone here is brilliant and  no matter what time of day or night someone will be here for u. Don't be scared to ask questions about anything. You end up getting told a lot of things that somethings you might forget what you were told. Just try get through your operation and you should get your results within2 weeks. Until then I really hope you'll be ok. Val x",

I've tried out the heat and massage and omg it's so great. Really good for when I'm in a lot of pain . Can't wait until dinner is ready then get my bath and sit back and relax. How's everyone doing  Hope all is well Sorry for the people that are just going through what I've been through but once it's over with its such a relief. I actually can't wait until may to see my surgeon for my reconstruction.  That'll be another couple of days in hospital but at least this time I have my frame so I can get about when I want too. Love & cyber hugs to you all  Val x",

      "Content": "Hi emj46.  I'm the exact same age as you and when I first went to see my doctor I had a very painful lump running from the side of my right breast to underneath so the GP thought it was a cyst. So I went for mammogram,ultra sound and biopsies. Not even thinking of cancer. I totally believed my GP  1 week later I got the results and had invasive ductal carcinoma grade 3.  Had lumpectomy  Didn't get enough margin so had 2nd op Got told in the first place I would most likely to get radiotherapy but possibly chemotherapy.  Now I've had 3 cycles of chemo and ready to get 3 cycles of docetaxel.  Told radiotherapy could be 3-4 weeks. Won't really know until chemo is finished. At first felt like my life was falling apart. Found it really hard.  I was the only one in my family to ever have cancer. Got told it was just one of those things. Really nice to know. Been doing really well with chemo itself but got other health problems  Now mobility really bad. Never in my life did I ever think that I would get cancer. When I got my results the tumor had  grown from being really small to 26 mm . That scared me a lot as it grew so fast. It hadn't spread which was really lucky.  Got 2 lymph nodes removed. At first when the gp had did the refferal it was about 5 weeks later when I had my app for mammogram.  The painful lump I felt had went right down and was really tiny so I was going to cancel my hospital app  I thought I better not so went anyway . I'm so glad I didn't cancel as my situation would be so different now. I wouldn't like to think how bad the cancer would've spread if I cancelled that app. Now I'm just taking each day as it comes and hoping when I get through the rest of my treatment I'll have about 7 months reprieve from hospital apps until I go back to the breast clinic . I keep checking all the time for lumps so I don't miss anything and I'll never cancel an app. Love n hugs  Val x",
