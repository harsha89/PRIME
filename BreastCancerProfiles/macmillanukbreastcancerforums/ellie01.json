      "Content": "Hi Blinky Im on my 11 th session of radiotherapy and compared to chemo its a doddle !! You just lay on the table and think nice thoughts (if that is possible) for no more than 10 mins . I was given some cream by the hospital and told to put it on morning and night, So far I have got no red marks and they said today that my skin was doing really well. I havent experience any side effects, probably just tiredness with driving there everyday on the motorway. I was told that I had to drink 2 ltrs of fluid a day like with the chemo but it could be ie juice or tea and coffee !!  mainly cos the radiotherapy is kiiling the cells and you need to take in fluid more. Also to rest when feeling tired,  (easier said than done) hope this helps margaret xxx",

I was diagnosed last Feb 2010 I had my lump removed and 23 nodes one of which was cancerous. they said that around the lump was clear and the cancer hadnt spread but I always have a fear if they were right. i had 6 treatments of TAC chemo which was horrid and then 4 weeks of radio . Im not taking any tablets as my test was negative so I couldnt have them. If you ever ever need a friend im here. This site has been fantastic for me. Ive met so many new friends who are going through the same and are there to listen. Please be strong. love margaret (ellie)",

      "Content": "Hi Cookie Oh just reading your posting has brought all the memories of last year back to me and me loosing my hair, I started my chemo last april and finished in aug 2010. I remember it was just 2 weeks after my first chemo that my hair started to fall out. I always said i would be strong and would be prepared for it. But I just broke down. I remember standing in  the shower and shaking and crying because it was that moment that it made it all clear to me what I was going through. My hair fell out daily but not in lumps but in strands I tried not to brush it alot to keep as much in as possible. My good friend is also my hairdresser and she was a total star to me. She told me not to worry about washing it  and try not to wash it alot. also not to use dry shampoo. She wouldnt cut it for me straight away just let it fall out naturally and i have to say it was the best advice. When she did eventually shave it for me she didnt take it all totally off i was left with a little bit. But I will always be gratefull to her. AFter all the rest of the treatment I never lost any more of it i was  never totally balled and also my hair started to return before my treament finished. This amazed the macmillian team and the nurses.  I used the Simply shampoo on the adivse of the hospital staff becuase it has no added stuff and is purely natural. Be strong and know that your hair will return. Mine is  now growing strong and curly ! keep smiling and be strong love and smiles margaret  xxxxx",

      "Content": "Hi gitte I totally understand how you are feeling. Im very much the same. I was diagnosed with Stage 3  Breast cancer last February 2010. I have completed all my chemo and radiotherapy in aug last year. I have been back this february and was given the all ok I go back again in July for another check up. when i completed all my treatment I thought  I would feel total relife and happiness. but I felt very alone, I think because of all the intense treatment and care when its taken away the feeling of loneliness is scarey. Like you all my friends and family were amazed at how strong I was and how I carried on during it all with my everyday life. And that was my choice becuase i didnt want to give in to this horrible disease. But like you know I feel alone at times, I have days where i sit and cry and feel scared that it could return anytime. I know i have to be positive but I feel sometimes that the disease can be cured but not always the mental strain. I feel scard at times because I m not taking any tablets now due to my hormones not being reseptive to them so I think \"Im on my own \" Be strong and its  nice to know that we are not alone. always here margaret xxx",

      "Content": "Hi Sally. Well done for being brave and positive. I was diagnosed Feb 10 with breast cancer. I had the lump removed and 4 nodes to start with. but then had to return for a second op because one of the nodes was cancerous. thankfully the lump was removed and the tissue round was clear. After my second op the rest of the 24 nodes were clear. I was adbvised strongly to have the chemo due to mine being grade 3 cancer and the fastest spreading. I began chemo (tac) on April 22nd and finished it on Aug 6th. I wont say it was easy but it was bearable better than i expected. The worst was the week after mainly having probs with eating and sore mouth. I hated taking all the steroids and antibiotics but it had to be done. I didnt try the cold cap as I was told by the nurse that my chemo was so strong it wouldnt help. I lost my hair within a month but accepted this. I had 4 weeks of radiotherapy this was easy compared to chemo. I am now all finished with treatment and have had a visit to hospital saying all clear . I go back again in July. Be strong and if there are days you want to cry then do so. if you want a day of screaming at everyone..... do it !!!!  and always remember this site and the people here are fantastic. I have made some brilliant friends who have helped me all the way. We are here for each other x  Your macmilian team will help they are fantastic x take care and keep smiling. love margaret",

      "Content": "Hi Zena Hey i totally understand how you are feeling. I finished my chemotherapy on August 6th this year and then had 4 weeks of radiotherapy which finished on 1st October. when I left the hospital after that last session I sat in my car and sobbed my heart out. I felt so alone and empty. I know that too many will sound daft but I knew while on treatment and seeing medical people every 3 weeks and everyday I was fine and they were helping me. But the feelingof being totally alone again was scarey. i saw the consultant who said all was ok !! and would see me for a ultra sound and mamogram in January 2011. The I saw the oncologist who said the treatment had gone really well and all my legs aches and arm pains were due to the intense chemo and not to worry. but go back if still there in 2./3 months ! I came out of them meetings numb !  mainly with fear of What the heck now !! how can you start living when your life has been on hold for the past year.  Its hard to start again. Its scarey each time you get a headache, pains in legs, a spot a bruise !!!  my mind works overtime. Im not on any other treatment now as my hormones werent able to work with the after drug !! great I thought. my body totally alone. I know I have the breast care nurse at the macmillian unit which is fantastic and I can contact her anytime. Be strong Zena. we are all here for each other.   margaret xx ",

      "Content": "Hi peter rabbit xx Under no circumstances can you have any treatment in the arm that was operated on. I was told that after I had my op and the nodes were removed I could no longer have any injections in that arm or blood pressure taken. also I had to be very carefull not to cut myself as the nodes werent there to protect my blood anymore. Im gobsmacked that they said that it would be alright this is so wrong. You could ask for the chemo to go into foot or leg. I had my chemo (6 lots) in my left hand. and not in my arm. Ask them to try your hand. Even when on my last treatment my vein blew i panicked they wouldnt be able to do it but she said oh dont worry we have you foot !!!  but she managed to get the  needle in by my thumb. Be strong and make sure you get all the correct information . Take care and good luck with the rest of your treatment love margaret",

There isnt a day that goes that I dont feel like my legs arms hands feet you name it doesnt hurt or ache, If i sit for long periods of time i stiffen up and cant walk properly. the foot i broke about 5 years ago has started to hurt alot i was sent for an xray just to be on the safe side !!  thank god it was nothing just got told it was the affects of all the treatment. I have been told to try all different vitamins, i did try vitamin c for bones but didnt help so i stopped. I have trouble with the arm i had the op on. ie where the nodes were removed i cant move my arm very high. I ddint think it would be like this.

      "Content": "Hi Sally. I had my chemo treatment last April. I was told about the cold cap. The oncologist wasnt keen on them at all. But said if I wanted to try it that was my choice. I was very unsure about them. I didnt fancy the ice cold feeling on my head and also the having to sit for 2 hours or more after the treatment after having already sat for 4 hours. the chemo I had was TAC  and very very strong. I was like I said unsure about the cold cap and after a few days I had a phone call from the Unit from the senior nurse who rang to put my mind at rest and help me make the choice. She said that with the strength of the chemo i was going to underake the cold cap wouldnt work and I would still loose my hair. I was glad that someone had told me this before I started with it. In the end I said no to it and sure i started to loose my hair within 2 weeks of the treatment. I got a wig from the unit and I have to say it looked really good just like my hair. but to be honest I wore it once . I kept trying to pull it down to make sure it was looking like a wig....... and to be honest if didnt the amount of folk that couldnt tell. and just thought I had a new style.  But it didnt last  and I resorted to just wearing my headwear which I found more comfortable and less restricting but everyone is different. You might find with the cold cap it slows down the hair loss process. Thats what I was told could happen (but wouldnt with me) it doesnt stop your hair falling out just reduces the time or just thins your hair. My treatment is now all over  (last october) my hair started tor return before the last treatment and now I go without the headwear and feel good that my hair is coming back stronger and thicker. Be strong, ask lots of questions, but be you and do what you feel happy doing.At the end of the day you are the patient and you are going through the treatment and questions have to be answered for you. Be strong, its hard during the treament but will be over before you know it trust me. love and hugs margaret",
