      "Content": "Aw JollyG you will definitely find out after surgery results what they suggest as treatment, if it is needed at all! It may be that they are able to get a wide enough margin which means treatment might not be necessary. I only had RT because although they had clear margins it was too close to the chest wall to be sure. I was lucky enough that RT wasn\u2019t too bad for me though the skin did break a little in the last week. For now just concentrate on getting through the surgery and if you decide not to have reconstruction then that\u2019s fine too. I do hope you get a date soon as I can sympathise with the worry and frustration as I had to wait 7 weeks and felt it was getting bigger (probably not). Keep strong and love yourself x",

      "Content": "Oh JollyG it\u2019s always complicated isn\u2019t it! I found a lump in September last year and although referred was assured it was nothing to worry about even following ultrasound and biopsy which showed PT, as it\u2019s rarely malignant! I had excision biopsy done which confirmed malignancy and then a WLE to clear everything, I was told it had all gone and went on a much needed holiday. Two months later another lump only bigger and told it would be fine until radiologist started sticking many needles into me and frowning. It was confirmed that it was PT and now aggressive so had to have mastectomy (which I had asked for initially). My lymph nodes were clear so Radiotherapy was the treatment required as this doesn\u2019t usually need chemo. I didn\u2019t get to choose reconstruction at the time due to RT and will decide later about this, more waiting lists! I am now used to nothing on one side and am seriously wondering about reducing the other breast instead  (I\u2019m quite large) as I don\u2019t want an implant and the other surgery means at least two more! You go with your gut as it usually gets it right! Best of luck and stick to your guns. Let me know how it goes x",

      "Content": "Hi scruffi, hope you don\u2019t mind me joining your chat as we seem to have similar stories. Have your previous surgeries shown PT as malignant or benign - I\u2019m assuming benign as they would have suggested mastectomy before now. I had two surgeries at turn of year which was for malignant PT and they thought they had it clear but 2 months later it was back bigger than ever and a mastectomy was needed. It was against my chest wall but they are happy they got it all and I then had 6 weeks of Radiotherapy to confirm clearance. It seems that this PT is a creeping form of cancer that is not well enough known. I do hope you can discuss this with supporting medical and nursing staff who can help you with a clear treatment plan. Keep ranting, that\u2019s what this site is good for. Be strong Cx",

I certainly wouldn\u2019t have problems with the spare tissue if I decide to have reconstruction hahaha. I can\u2019t say I had pain but perhaps my memory is distorted as it\u2019s 6 months ago, which of course isn\u2019t long but your focus is on current treatment. Since my mastectomy I have had the oddest feeling from time to time that I have an itch in my nipple, which of course isn\u2019t there! It may be that your skin is being stretched and causing your pain. It\u2019s great that you have good pain threshold as it will help through surgery and recovery.",

I have read up about phyllodes and it is annoying that it is often dismissed as not being cancer (even by medical/nursing staff). I realise that there are many forms of breast cancer, which only comes with personal experience and reading, it is a pity that we are all unaware until affected!  I have never been on this type of forum before and feel so lucky that I am currently not experiencing the range of problems of some contributors. Best thoughts go to everyone and great that this site is available.",

      "Content": "Hi Scruffi, sorry to hear your diagnosis and fingers crossed things go well at your next surgery. I had a mastectomy mid May but my surgeon said he would discuss reconstruction later due to my needing radiotherapy. It really is upsetting/annoying/scary that there isn't much information about phyllodes but perhaps that will change in time. My oncologist is following a study into breast sarcoma (which includes phyllodes) as it is a soft tissue cancer. Do make use of your BC nurses who I found to be invaluable when questions needed answering, they can relate much better than surgeons who find it difficult to talk in real terms rather than medical! Best of luck with your surgery xxx",

Wow 12cm is big,no surprise you are uncomfortable - mine was 6cm which seemed big enough! Although I didn\u2019t have nodes taken out I have a friend who has recently had this and had been ok. You need to make sure you keep doing the exercises they give you afterwards, it does seem to help. You will find out if further treatment is needed after report comes back. What about reconstruction, did you go for or against? I don\u2019t really mind mammogram either but it\u2019s just the thought of it. Thoughts and hugs with you x",

What is your next step to clarify your situation, have you had a biopsy and are they planning a wide excision?  Have you had previous fibroadenoma as this, from what I can read can be a pattern for this type of disease. You are right that there is little out there about this and unfortunately the medical and nursing professionals are inclined to dismiss it out of hand until a definitive diagnosis has been made. I had to have a mastectomy and Radiotherapy but am now 5 weeks post treatment and feeling well! Do feel free to message as your treatment progresses and best of luck. Cx",
