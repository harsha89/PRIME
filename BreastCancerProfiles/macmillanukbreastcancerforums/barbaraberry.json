      "Content": "Hi Dawn, I just want to tell you how helpful your blog with your photos has been to me. I so wish I had seen it when I was diagnosed with breast cancer in August; instead I scared myself with Google pictures. You look wonderful and I find your positive images and words very uplifting. I had mx right breast in September and I am now half way through having chemo and due to start herceptin as I had multi focal grade 3 tumours. My Mum died of cancer in her early 60s and I so feel for your loss. I have good and bad days at the moment - my partner Peggy and my sister and friends keep me going through the rough times. Also I do chi kung and walk by the sea which keeps me positive. Wishing you lots of good times ahead. Berry  xx",

      "Content": "Hi I have just found this site this week and have been reading all the posts - I am so glad to have found this group. It is wonderful to know that women are supporting each other through our breast cancer journeys. I do empathise so much with the dilemma of what to do about treatment choices. No easy answers. I have  Grade 3  ER positive HER2 positive. I had a mastectomy of right breast last month and am due to start chemo and then Herceptin on 13th November followed by Rads and tamoxifen. I am recovering pretty well from the surgery, except can't sleep very well even with lots of pillows as I can't lie on my side - any tips? I have been struggling with accepting that I need all the followup treatments but am now convinced, partly because of reading all the comments from this group. Thanks to all. I'm not sure how to post comments, hope this works??",

      "Content": "Hi Andrea, Thanks very much for your reply to my post. What you say about one step at a time is such good advice. It is difficult to keep it in mind sometimes especially when things feel overwhelming. Now that I have accepted the need for chemo I am feeling afraid but also trying to get mentally prepared for it. Yes please let's keep in touch as we go along. I wish you all the very best for your first chemo on Thursday. I will be thinking of you. Please let me know how you are doing. Berry x",
