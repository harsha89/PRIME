      "Content": "Hi Because of the size it was recommended to have a masectomy.  I was diagnosed on 20 Sept. Had mx and sentinel lymph node biopsy on 15 Oct.  was home the next day and felt fine.  Had to have seroma drained bit it was not painful.  Because of the type pf cancer HER negative it was sent off for an oncotype dx report to see if I needed chemo.  This did delay things by two weeks.  My appt for the results was 30th November.  It came back 32 so this means that there is a 32% chance of recurrence so I needed chemo and rads.  I start chemo on 23 Dec 6 x FEC in 3 weekly cycles.  There will then be a 3 week gap and will start rads, 3 weeks daily Monday to Friday, i.e 15 sessions.  Obviously I am fully fit at the moment and could easily have worked 2 weeks after masectomy.  Not sure how I will feel during chemo as it effects everybody differently but I will keep you posted. I work as a consultant from home and pretty much can arrange appts as and when I feel able although I may have to deal with urgent issues, and I do intend to try and carry on.   Financially you should be entitled to some benefits if you are not working.  Macmillan do have benefits advisers they maybe able to help you.   Good luck and I hope that the lump is benign.

      "Content": "Hi Of course you are scared.  We all are.  If its any help to you I was told I had a 5.5cm lump which following masectomy turned out to be 4.5.  Even though it was aggressive there was no spread to lymph nodes.  I have got to have chemo and rads.  So dont give up be positive it does help and you will then be able to deal with whatever treatment they decide, if it is cancer.

      "Content": "Hi   I feel fine at the moment and am doing all the normal things I did prior to the masectomy.  Can honestly say it only took about a week before I was back to normal.  I do think it is important that you get everything done prior, i.e ironing, meals in freezer, just in case, that gives you more time to deal with the children.   Yes I do have children but they are older although I do have 4 grandchildren, 7, 4, 11mths and 5 mths.  I looked after the 4 yr old and 11 mth baby last weekend no trouble, and have the 5 mth old today overnight til tomorrow as it is my daughters works party.   I have aglso done all my Christmas shopping and intend to have it all wrapped prior to chemo. FEC is chemotherapy which I start on 23rd every 3 weeks - 6 rounds.  This is then followed by radiotherapy. Best wishes lynne",

      "Content": "Hi I had a mx and sentinel node biopsy (they took 3 nodes) in oct 2015.  I could lift my arm above  my head after the op before I left hospial no trouble so I think it does depend on how many nodes they remove.  I too was worried about drying my hair. I think if they find any of the nodes positive they then take more away and that is when the need for exercises kick in.  I might be wrong and was lucky I dont know. Lynne",
