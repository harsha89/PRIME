      "Content": "Hi, Have you asked about hospital transport? You do have to be ready a while before in case there are other patients to pick up. They will take you home & make sure you are safely in. Met some lovely people lots of volunteers do the driving. Tell receptionist no-one to take you at all, if you have someone give you a lift they will say you can manage all the time.Take a book with you, maybe even lunch, depends time of treatments. I take my steroids after breakfast, told by nurse to take them after eating. Still get hyper but not so bad. I would stay off work as long as you need, you have & are going through a huge emotional upset.  When I feel down & alone in the day, I go for a walk regardless of the weather. Helps sort my mind out. Be kind to yourself. Scilly x  ",

      "Content": "Hi rexsi78, I live alone & as you say friends & family are lovely to have for support in daylight hours, but once night sets in or wakefulness in the small hours, life is very hard. I started going to GPs with pain near on two years ago then last Feb the pain got worse, especially ay night.. Kept being told although GP said unusual to be in so much pain when resting., Even had to call 999 one night. I have shed loads of tears & thought I could not cry anymore. My neighbour has told me to phone her in the night, but I could not do that. The best thing is to just cry s much as you need or want. I got myself a new cat in December . I had 2 rescue cats 18 months before this. then in the January the one got run over because a neighbour had kept her in her house instead of sending her home. She was mostly black & it was a wet night So the next day I got a phone call. The other although only young had fits, & I did not want her on drugs because of blood test.& drugs not 100% She was very daring, twice I had the fire brigade out because she chased squirrels up the tallest trees about & could not get down, having spent all night up them. Then she climbed onto a neighbours roof, again spent the night there. Luckily my friends husband climbed onto the parch & managed to manoeuvre a ladder onto the roof, dormer bungalow, & she came down. Then in August her fits escalated & I had to have her put to sleep. I was devastated & gave all my cat things & food away. I knew by then I had cancer & as it was my third lot I did not want to risk getting a pet not knowing what I had to face. When I finished chemo I felt I needed a little friend. She is adorable & follows me about. sleeps by me where ever it may be. Just be kind to your self & it does get easier. This site is amazing. The `Awake` thread has helped me over these last months, especially at night because you can write what you are feeling & there will be an answer & kind words & usually something funny to make you smile. take each hour then day at a time.

      "Content": "Hi Judith, I went to a talk given by Monty Don, he is as lovely in real life. I bought a raffle ticket so, hopefully, I would win & collect prize from him, maybe a kiss! I won the raffle, but prize was collected on way out. Last night just sitting on floor waiting for cream to work, when a mouse ran along skirting in front of me. My delightful cat had brought me a present. Put down friendly traps then injected myself. It was behind TV cupboard so emptied it so I could move it & the little critter ran out to other side of room. By now my room was as if a bomb had gone off. Got the hoover out with cloth over end to try to catch him. Text neighbours to apologise about noise. Did not hear hoover. No joy. So off to bed. Not seen it today, so do not know where it is.

I put a small plaster with an arrow on to mark where cream is. If you like gardens Gardening World magazine out now, has 2 for 1 booklet. Gardens all over UK. Also several packs of seeds & a pair of gardening gloves with this issue. Also offer discounts at some gardens for single person. Do you feel the cold more since you have been on thinners? Scilly x",

      "Content": "Hi Lisa, Just saw your post, it is awful! I live in the Midlands & my daughter, aged 42. Saw her GP just over two weeks ago Easter Monday, went to a `one stop clinic` the next Monday. Had a mammogram, scan, biopsy bloods etc. Results same Morning, Triple Negative breast cancer. Having Titanium clip in this coming Wednesday. Then having chemo once every 3 weeks to shrink 11mm lump. Wire to locate site of cancer before lumpectomy. This is how it should be, surely Drs/surgeons know how stressful it is to wait. They must have other anaethatists! What if he was ill for a long time, As to results for your husband, the hospital involved phones direct to patient with results, it is then up to you if you hear them or wait until you see GP or DR. Have you contacted PALS at your hospital? Good luck, Scilly.",

      "Content": "Hello Lou, I had breast cancer 22 years ago & had a lumpectomy, then 20 doses of radiotherapy. I recovered & have live a healthy life.  Sadly I now have a plasmacytoma in my leg & need 25 doses of radiotherapy. I feel lucky that it is only in one area. I know it  can spread, but I will be closely monitored for a long time. You will be strong once you start what ever treatment you are given. Just take a day at a time & enjoy the small things like a sunny day. You will find anyone in your treatment room will be ready to chat.  These areas are happy places & this will give you strength to carry on. However bad you feel,it will pass. Good wishes.",
