    "Content": "  Hi   I found a really lovely wig through the Trevor Sorbie \"my new hair\".  The woman at my local salon was so knowledgable and suggested a soft cotton mesh cap that you wear under your wig so that its more comfortable. She also suggested that I buy myself a silk pillowcase because cotton ones can rub a little.  Also something I hadn't thought of but a soft cotton sleep cap because my head will get cold at night!!  Hope these little snippets useful, and that you don't suffer too much discomfort.   Alex ",
