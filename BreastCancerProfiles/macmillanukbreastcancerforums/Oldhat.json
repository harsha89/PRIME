      "Content": "Oo you tough girls are impressive ! Wish I had the nerve. Ive only ever seen my oncologist twice,  Jan 2010 to tell me Hi, now its chemo time, and secondly Hi, change to Tax time. Jolly woman, thought she was interested in her job, but that seems to have been wildly over-optimistic. Questions get routed back through the macmillan breast nurse, who seems actually to know nothing practical. I had trouble with nerve damage (feet mainly) on Tax, complained but got no one looking at or interested.. they just stopped the chemo at 3 rather thsan the original 4. No advice about how to look after resulting nerve damage. Just got used to it.  Was not told result of bone density test when going on Arimidex.. though it put me in the at risk level, and my arm broke. Im always confused about getting results, waiting for letters, who to ask.. partly my fault you see !!  as a solitary ill person one isnt necessarily capable of making the right decisions at the right time. THEY should make sure one knows at least ? And the next grouse.. I asked the nurse in Jan if the nerve damage could go in the other direction, brain..  asked GP, and nurse, and surgeon at check-up time, and messsage from GP to oncologist during this year, if Arimidex side sffects could be responsible for word and memory loss and general mental reduction.. as suggested by internet records of research.. everyone treated this as ridiculous, but didnt seek alternative explanation till July when I was scheduled for check at memory clinic in case it was JUST alszheimers or something, with MRI to follow.. am now found to have breast secondary tumour plum in the middle of brain, thalamus. And was treated hastily and magnificently at Leeds.. gamma knife. (They cant treat once size exceeds 3cm)        But the thing that made me crossest was the general dismissal of the possibility of a questionable side effect of one of the MAIN drugs they prescribe, Arimidex. A main drug, surely they should be at least conscious and aware of questions about it ???   I found out the medical research going into this on the internet of course, and am well aware that though other research leaves it very open to question, there are enough analyses, comparisons of brain-effect between it and tamoxifen  etc, to suggest that in some cases there IS concern. And how DARE they not know this, and consider my symptoms. GRRRR !!!",

      "Content": "I havent had this reaction to Tx (yet?). Though hands are looking very wrinkly and a bit splotchy I havent worried about this effect yet. But there have been a couple of references on this website to treatment on Tx in France, where people are using coolers on their hands, possibly feet as well. Same as can be done with the scalp coolers to minimise hair loss, to stop the chemo going there. They were suggesting sticking your hands in those pre-cooled wine-coolers while you have the treatment. It sounds sensible to me, if a bit heath robinson. It sounds very bad that your friend feels the chemo nurses arent interested, and I think she should make more fuss !! These are difficult and upsetting things to cope with, and from what one reads here there is often more that can be done for one than is immediately on offer.",

Im trying to patch the gaping holes in my efficiency today, paperwork and phone calls. How are you getting on after your final dose ? Are you still feeling up to going into the Haven tomorrow, Tuesday ? Ive got my appointment there at 2.0pm. If you are going to be around, Id love to meet up and have a \"coffee\" even if it turns out to be chamomile tea. Probably before the appointment.. but after would be ok. What is your timing ? xHat",

      "Content": "Hi Vicky, yes its all bewildering, the nutrition thing. Ive booked an appointment with the nutritionist at the Breast Cancer Haven on Tuesday 16th, to try and sort it all out. I have 3rd chemo four days before, so hope Im up to travelling there. Will be getting sleepy by then. I know that all the dark green veg are good, broccoli, spinach, water cress etc, as are the red/yellows, and dark purple fruit and berries.. but thats a broad brush and theres much more to it. I have eaten very healthily for the last 8 years.. raw veg at lunchtime and far more than the 5 a day.. so flippin healthily I'm disgusted I got cancer.. think of all those chocs and cakes I might have eaten ! o well. The American Cancer advice web advocates extra intake of protein and carbs to build strength to sustain during chemo.. but their menu sounds wildly exaggerated and counter to all advice Ive heard here, as its full of ice cream, cream in everything, meats etc. I have to wonder if it was sponsored by their dairy industry. Here we are told to avoid dairy..  does that include organic skimmed mild.. anyone know ? Maybe I'll post something about the advice I get on the 16th ? all the best, oldhat",

      "Content": "Good morning all, another week of wonders.. Sunday was nice.. a walk through a local dale with daughter, hefty lunch at pub.. tried a shandy and couldn\u2019t manage it so back to pints of water.. Thanks Fiona, yes  roll on our parties.. I think it will be August for me.. a while off, but steadily getting nearer. Over the weeps again now.. its only occasional.. usually I find plenty of better things to think on. Its just so embarassing when you lose control of the tap. Im so sorry you find you scar untouchable still. I felt mine needed all the help it could get and massaged it lightly with bio-oil. The physio said to just lightly rest my fingers on the surface and rotate, as if you were moving one sheet of paper over another.. not too deep. My lumps have gone down, and I now find it acceptable as part of me, if not exactly the perfection I had imagined decorating with a bluebird tattoo. I have never felt  the sense of violation that some women do. It was the cancer that violated me, not the operation.. though when the scar was most hideous it was certainly very worrying. Im looking forward to hearing how pink over black looks on your nails ladies . Josie, hi, Im glad to hear you are over the bad bit and feeling  stronger. The lines issue sounds very stressful, not to mention \"uncomfortable\" ! . I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll all be hoping  that works out ok for you this week. Are you living on your own too ? I do think it can be harder to cope with the downs alone.. although not having keep up appearances  for the sake of others is welcome sometimes. I think there is a sense of great safety in company, that there is someones else\u2019s strength other than ones own to depend on. Though at the same time, for me, I need my own space to get on with the things I do and cant survive as me without it. V contradictory. I have a friend in America who keeps insisting I shouldnt be living on my own at this time, hire someone she says.. o dear. Noj.. re value of online info.. quite so.. well put. I do wish the medicals could acknowledge our need to know the possible problems and how to prepare for them. Katrina.. setting off for radiotherapy this week ? Do let us know how this feels. Will it make you tired.. how does it feel ? I really hope you are feeling well and up to it and sailing on. All best wishes to everyone for the week ahead. X Hat",

And I have to say it was encouraging as well.. you are looking quite inspirationally gorgeous .. and if one can go through chemo and come out the other end looking like that,  well .. all I can say is its very reassuring. Loved the colours. I'll have to try harder with scarves. And thanks for all the advice too. I'll be having the blood tests tomorrow, hoping for chemo 3 on Friday, and will ask about the Hirudoid gel you had to soften the sore veins. Its also reassuring to hear about all you other women who are having sessions delayed by blood results, and getting the injections to stimulate production.. it makes it feel less of a crisis. Im supposed to go into Haven again next Tuesday for their induction day, and will do unless Im flattened  by the next dose. I wish you the very best for the  next stage of your treatment. My friend said that slapping on the 100% pure aloe vera gel from the health shop made the radiotherapy problem free, no burning, no hardening.  Ive seen it recommended by other people too. I'll definitely try it when that comes round for me. very best wishes, Hat",

      "Content": "Hi Katrina, thanks for that reply.. Im a bit slow at answering things Im afraid.. a bit slow at everything at the moment.. little SLEEPS just keep beconning ! though I have been getting on with some jobs and getting outwith the camera in between for the last 2 sunny days. Anyway, your account of the neutrophil low was very interesting. IT must have been so worrying for you at the time, and it put my situation well into perspective. I just need to make sure Im sitting down if I get dizzy. After the faint I decided to get more food into myself and feel better for it, or maybe its just because Im now on the upward slope again. I have booked myself an appointment with Ms Murphy the nutritionist and hope to get some confusions sorted out - phyto oestrogens yes or no, whether organic skimmed milk is a no like other dairy things, to anti-oxidant or not, and why some chemo docs advise treating diarrhoea with pro-biotic yoghurt while others say avoid it.  Theres such a lot of details to get ones head round.. someone, was it you, said every cycle brings up new issues. Maybe one settles down to the mystery tour, takes it with a bit more equanimity as time goes on and one gets used to being a bit out of control. I do feel my oncologist might live on another continent. Ive only seen her once for 5 mins, but I suppose she'd be there if I really needed something, rather than just sitting here panicking. Are you feeling more stable now, confident with the successful medication ? Do you live in Leeds.. I'll be going in next for that Haven appointment on Tuesday 16th if you happened to be around for a coffee. Coffee ?  sounds good. Im trying hard to love greeen tea.  oldhat",

Great. Ive had 2 days with getting out and about, though walking slower and flaking out in bed at tea time, but even if not on peak form its worth it to get away. Id hoped to do it last weekend, but after the fainiting I spent the whole week in recovery mode & very unconfident. Im on just Epirubicin and Cyclophosphamide.. while most of you are talking about FEC and other things.. and I think Im getting off lightly so far.. very tired but not much else.. though my fall left me with aches that seem to get worse rather than better. No nasty taste. Digestion reasonable.. appetite ok.. only occasional insomnia.. bladder irritation has calmed down again..(8 pees a night for a couple of days !) Does anyone know the reasons for different chemo programs ? Is it age related ? stage of cancer ? I had 18of 19 lymph nodes affected + 2.5cm lump.. post-menopausal. Im guessing a lot of you are much younger.. do you have to have different treatment for that reason ? xxHat  ",

      "Content": "Hello, can I join in here ? Im new on site, feeling the need to hear other peoples experiences of chemo.. and its been comforting to look in on all your comments and anxieties. Ive had  2 of 8 cycles of E/C, and am just emerging from fatigue week into the better 2nd week. I passed out in the shower on day 7, crashed out and hurt my foot and back, woke up feeling like a broken spider in a heap, didnt know who I was or which way up.. Mighty sorry for myself but glad I hadnt hit my head. I suspect anemia, but my breast nurse doesnt seem interested in my DIY theory. Ive been surprised that there has been no advice re extra nutritional needs while the body tries to get on with the extra challenges of chemo. Has anyone else been told to eat more protein, carbs, B12, iron etc ? I eat very healthily normally, fresh veg, fish etc, but having looked at the US cancer website and seen the emphasis put on building the body to withstand chemo, it makes sense, and Ive lost a little weight instead. My first cycle wasnt bad, tired for 10 days, then pretty good again, so I was perhaps taking it all a bit casually. Now, on a low day I feel like my body is an unfamiliar vehicle, like Im travelling into unknown territory in a space-ship driven by Ground-Control NASA.. the solitary astronaut in outer space.. you can try and get information or responses checked by remote communications which may or may not get asnwered seriously, but this vehicle is very much on its own in a place its never been before and unsure if its properly equipped. Someone just recommended the Essiac remedy to me too.. havent tried it.. let us know if you feel its doing you good. Anyway, its great to hear you people all getting on with the job !

I hope you are feeling ok, going to get a good nights sleep, and hope you can take it easy and do what your body says it needs..  Hope you dont get the nausea. Are you having steroids ? They made me feel quite lively for a couple of days, tiredness gradually coming later. I feel as if it is definitely taking longer to repair the twists I gave myself when I fell. Im used to straining my back (absent minded hoovering is the worst) and usually its eased off in a few days. Not this time, though the foot and knee are pretty much ok now.   Bev.. Its frustrating about not recognising lumps isn\u2019t it.. me neither. Thought it was just the vagaries of tissue and glands.. always a bit lumpy. And breasts do change.. don\u2019t they ??.. Ive never thought mine were just one shape and ever more would be so. I feel like a twit now.. could have caught it sooner. Forion... 11th (!!) chemo day ? That sounds like a lot. Are you on shorter cycles ?   And Katerina.. well done you for making it to the other end and persisting through what sounds like a truly awful last day ! Why do you think you had that very strong reaction ?  Do you think it was the accumulation, your body having had about all it could take ? Have you had anything like that before? Anyway, poor you. You must be so thankful its over now, and looking forward to a gradual return to strength, knowing that its done the job and you wont have to take any more of that. How long a break do you have before suntan city ? I have been trying to drink a lot, a lot more than usual, and much more puritanically,  but Im useless at keeping count.  Id love to meet up on 16th, if you are up to it. I haven\u2019t got my diary with me here, so will let you know my timing later.   And Cherub, good luck with number 3.  Do they give you lots of anti-sickness pills ? Its a drag they aren\u2019t working for you ! I hope its not so bad this time. Do you ever have ginger tea ? ginger and lemon is nice.. Twinings.. or just grated ginger in any drink. Probably no use, but its quite good in normal circumstances for sickness. Trouble is these times aren\u2019t so normal.   Lots of love to you all, Hat",

Its amazing isnt it how after a total life changing event like being diagnosed with this, one can get past the shock, past the op, past the scans.. and eventually we'll get past the chemo and the rest and pick up with life again. Ups and downs, but how resilient human nature is. It may sound nasty though, and I dont want to lower the tone, I'm kind of relieved to hear that there are lots of you out there finding it hard too. Theres so much attitude about people who sail through it, no probs, I sometimes feel as if we are expected to keep up an illusion of it being a picnic, for the public good. What you say about anti-oxidants is interesting..  llittle I know.. never thought of that. Is that supported by the Haven nutritionist ? Leeds is my nearest (Im in Halifax)and I'll take up their advice. Sounds a good idea. I find all that pink a bit hard to handle though. And its difficult sifting advice.. such as sugar feeding cancer cells so dont eat sweet fruit... does it really ?? what about the honey on my porridge? cant live without it ! and o am I missing a tipple ! Katrina, was the granulocyte injection prescribed as a result of the nadir blood test taken in the 1st cycle ? How did they/you know it was needed ?

Jodie, your Mum's lucky to have a daughter being so thoughtful about caring for her. I hope she's feeling ok. I too was due to have my (3rd) dose of EC today, but Ive been postponed for a week because the blood counts are too low. I asked what I could do to help them recover (ie diet) and was told I just had to wait for the body to do its thing.  I may phone them today to ask if I can have a print out of the blood count, to take to my appointment with the Haven dietician next week. I know they measure things like calcium as well as white cells, and Im curious about whats going on. Dont know whether I'll be given that information and  Im reluctant to make nuisance demands. Im quite glad of a week off, as i dont really feel strong enough for no 3 yet, but irritated that it stretches out and disrupts the diary plans. My daughter asked if Id like to go to an opera with her in a few weeks, fitted in with the chemo program. I was so touched as she doesnt usually offer to share my tastes, and now the date will probably be difficult.   Im taking it easy this morning.. feet up.. hoping rest is useful. Sunday Im due to be out planting trees with a voluntary group I work with..  thats the excercise bit. Theres a thread back in general cancer forum on this site, which discusses medic's lack of interest in diet, which leaves us in limbo about what we can do to help ourselves.  They have their specialist skills and techniques to focus on, but food, excercise and behaviour are the areas left to us to work out.. areas which can make us feel that we are contributing positively to our own cure. all best wishes to you all xx Hat  ",

      "Content": "Hi all.. Im getting a lot of reassurance from your letters, and realising that the things I get panicked about are not unusual and that people can deal with them. So thanks to you all for what you are sharing here. I had an appointment with the nutritionist at the Leeds Haven yesterday, and did learn some interesting things, though I wasnt as prepared as I should have been. It may be all stuff that you are familiar with already. Her advice was mostly general health improvement rather than specifically related to eating during chemo.. but she did emphasise the principal of not taking any supplements or exaggerated dietary items, definitely not without checking with the oncologist. She explained that anti-oxidants coat the cells with a protective layer which could block the chemo effect.. though the antioxidants from a healthy quantity of multi-coloured veg. etc would not be a problem. She was strong on the blood-sugar levels.. counteracting the tendency to get highs and lows which are intensified during chemo.  She said not to go without food for more than 3 hours, and to have snacks of slow release foods, slow carbs and always some protein as well, oat biscuits with hummus,rye bread and a boiled egg , a fruit with nuts,  to stop the blood sugar rising again too fast. Not sugary things as cancer cells produce a fermentation effect which feeds on sugars. Reduce stimulants, caffeine, sugar, alcohol, and stress, which also raises BLS. Do some switching off every day to stabilise levels.. meditation, or for those with less discipline like me, sudoku, or anything that absorbs ones attention for a while. There was a muesli type bar you can get at Sainsbury's, Village Bakery brand, which has loads of good nuts and seeds and friut and no sugar.. I'll be trying it, as I just have to have a treat from time to time. Soya for protein.. to be careful that one wasnt buying stuff with soya-isolate in it.. just straight bean products.. tofu, miso.. and to eat in moderation, maybe a few times a week but not to excess.. as the phyto oestrogen question has not been resolved yet. Dairy.. only a little.. as even in skimmed organic milk the cow's own hormones get through. For spreads use Pure (made with sunflower) or vitaquel. Get plenty of calcium from sesame seeds (tahini) figs, broccoli, beans. Thats enough for now.. Ive got to turn in. Out early tomorrow. Does anyone find their head gets cold without hair, and hot when you wear something ?   best wishes and good night, Hat  ",

      "Content": "  Well.. thats EC number 3 ..one more to go.  I feel much relieved to have had it now, though this morning I woke up with the weeps, which recurred as I walked into the department and just wouldn\u2019t stop !  I had to get the curtain drawn so as not to depress the others. But having hot tea, hot arm-pack, and buried myself drippily in a Sudoku, the nice nurse eventually got me to rights.        She gave me some Hydrodoid cream and an extra hot pack on the sore veins bits, which made it loads better.   I had a chat to the Macmillan nurse as well as I was a bit under the weather, and had queries  about the next  round of 4 x Taxotere.  (She says that some people find it easier than EC. The lucky ones ?.) She pointed out something I had wondered about.. what do you think girls ??... She said the people who come on the forum here are likely to be the ones who have had problems, or be worried by what the treatment will do to them.. not the people who sail through it all without trouble.. of whom there may be lots. The implication being that we may be scaring eachother with tales of side effects that we may not all encounter.  For myself I dont agree. Hearing from you all, I feel better informed about those things, and I bear in mind that effects vary from person to person, which is born out by your stories. I think information from the hospital is minimal, and leaves one not knowing what to expect and unnecessarily anxious when/if side effects start, not knowing how to assess their seriousness. Talking is always good. And Im watching your reactions to Taxotere with great interest., and am more prepared than I would have been without this forum.. hope for the best, prepare for the worst. I really don\u2019t like surprises !   I had felt this after the op. I wasn\u2019t told, nor were the women I went through with, the simple fact that our mastectomy scars might be swollen, lumpy, red, hard, tight, pressuring the muscle etc for many weeks.  We were taken aback and worried, having expected a fairly smooth area to develop quite quickly and only been shown one nice photo of a perfectly healed scar. Of course it does improve and we needn\u2019t have worried. We wouldn\u2019t have if we\u2019d been told. I think they should have a book of photos of various stages of progress that one could ask to see if one wanted that info.. to show what variations can still be normal.   The chemo nurse today explained the blood count print out to me, which was useful. I had assumed the list on the right, the healthy parameters, were what your levels related to. But she said that in chemo the acceptable parameters were considerably lower..ie minimum levels were:    Haemoglobin ok at 9.0 or 10.0, rather than the 11.5 normal minimum; WBC ok at 3.0 not 3.5; Platelets at 100 not 140 ; Neutrophils at 1.5 not 1.7... so I wasn\u2019t as low as my interpretation of the figures.. Anyway, Id come up nicely in the extra week they gave me, so hoping for the best this time round.   The weekend is here.. I hope you are all going to have something nice to do, enjoy some good home time, get some sunshine, and good luck with your next sessions. My daughter is coming tomorrow, She says she has exciting news. What can that be ???? Love, Hat",

      "Content": "  Hello again to all you fellow explorers . and Hi Bev, the nutirionist was recommending all the other milks one could substitute for cow\u2019s, though she didn\u2019t say one shouldn\u2019t have ANY.  I haven\u2019t tried them yet, except soy milk which is the one that curdles  disgustingly in coffee and I thought pretty horrid anyway. The ones I will try which she was keen on  were oat milk and almond milk. But Im enjoying finishing off the organic skimmed cow first ! and may return to it unless the others turn out really nice. I do believe a LITTLE of what you fancy does you good.   Hearing Connor talk about fear of chemo and the unknown.. yes I so share that, and its difficult to confess to friends and family. They are trying so hard to keep one optimistic, and we don\u2019t want to frighten them with our fear,  specially not our children, however grown up they are. But its there in the small hours and  Im so grateful for the kindness of people that sees one through it.  Each time you get to the other side of some new thing though, I think ones confidence builds.   Katie, Im aghast that they only had two hot packs in your ward and that you had to try the radiator! the hot water bottle is an idea I might copy .. and will ask about the gel. Tomorrows my day.. oops, I see its today already and Ive got to be up early again to let the probation lads onto their work site, so id better get to bed. Late again. Take care of yourselves, x Hat",

      "Content": "Mornin all.. Hope we are all in good heart for another week of  wintriness after that seductive spell of spring sun. Wasnt that lovely !!  I sowed the broad beans, kale an cabbage and made my plot look all freshened up. Think that  was premature. How are you going along Katrina ? Are you having it every day now ? I think you are the first person on this thread who has got as far as the radio stage, and I guess we will all be listening and hoping its going to be easy on you. You were told to expect tiredness.. maybe burning.. and oozing (???!!! I sure hope you don\u2019t get that.. that must be from quite severe burning I imagine, and surely that shouldngt happen ?) For me its a long way off yet, but at the moment, having had a much better time on EC round 3, eating more to keep strength up and expecting less of myself,  I feel the time will slide by. Noj, youve been through your radio times,  how was it for you ? As tiring as the chemo ?   Forion, is your scar still bothering you ? What does your doc say about the redness ? Have they been reassuring ?  its a long time since Nov.. thats a long time waiting to feeling ok about it. They do say it can be 6 months till it finally settles, but thats a bit vague.   Delilah, I\u2019m hoping your line attachment goes smoothly this week. Good luck. My friend in USA had a port put under the skin in her chest (stomach cancer). It seemed painless once in, and worked well.   Re the alcohol (couldn\u2019t take the shandy) but had a single neat Famous Grouse on Friday, and O WOT BLISS. Mid you it tasted different from how it used to.. much sweeter, like honey, strange. Theres something in me telling me not to go there too often but unfortunately theres no inner voice controlling the food intake, and while I feel a lot better with more in me, and there\u2019s certainly a  big urge to eat , a lot of that urge is craving sweet things, (and dairy) which didn\u2019t afflict me before. Half a slab of halva disappeared just like that on Sunday  (and thats not all). I am well aware that we are warned off all the sugars as they feed the \u201cfermentation\u201d of active cancer cells, and dairy because of the hormones. So say all the  nutritionists.  But I have no idea what that sugar/cancer fermentation  process really is.    Anyone know ?   Another open question: Has anyone had a mastectomy and not had reconstruction ? Using a prosthesis ? Or going without ? I haven\u2019t dealt with this yet, have been wearing a basic soft bra without prosthesis, or wearing nothing. Its time I sorted it out maybe. The bra rides up under the armpit a bit which is uncomfortable, less but a bit even if I anchor it to my knockers with a bit of elastic. Ive heard prostheses get a bit hot. They are weighted. .Can feel oppressive.  Does that work to stop riding up and general shifting around ? Whats left, the other side, is quite small, so its only a small problem for me.. but needs a bit of thought. Any experiences to share ? All best wishes to you all xxx Hat.",

I too have slept and slept.. 10 hours a day seems needed. I am assuming this is all the medication's fault. Im nearly 67, though essentially fit, so hormone levels low anyway, and now zilch. I think a lot of the bodies functions are determined by hormones, and mine have altogether stopped functioning ! Plus I cant remember names and useful words. Cant concentrate on detail.

I may take advice and look for those extra pain-killers, as the old paracetamol was what I was told to take, and when I moaned they said take ibuprofen on top, and when I  moaned agaian they said yes i could take a sleeping pill too.. It was the lack of sleep really got me down last time, and not being able really to realx during the day either because one just aint comfortable. This time I am prepared not to try to do anything remotely tiring and try and keep calm. My nurses are very cynical about nail varnish.. they always play it by the book though I have to say Im not keen, because on me it always goes chipped and grotty. But I am looking at lumps appearing on a couple of nails, and flakey ends, and wondering if that means they are lifting. Is it real direct sunlight that affects them or general light ? Hat",

Your GP's practice would also be able to take on this side of her problems.  Also, I have phoned the help line on this website a couple of times for advice, and they are very kind, take time, and take one seriously.Support for ones emotional well-being is an important part of treatment and ones ability to come through it. The drugs affect people differently, and often extremely strongly, and I would have thought it should be the medics responsibility to keep an eye on that and help, or provide other supportive medication. Im sure I read on the leaflet that came with my steroid prescription that a psychosis could occur.. maybe act as a trigger, even if she is no longer taking them.
