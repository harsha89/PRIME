    "Content": "I agree with the above posts - it all depends on what you do, and how you react to the chemo.  I run my own business and am the main breadwinner and therefore it was a really worrying time for me when I started my 6 sessions way back in Feb.  Could I handle client meetings?  Would my ability to plan ahead be affected?  Would I even be OK in terms of being able to do all the things I used to?  Now I'm 6 months in and I've worked almost 100% from home, probably doing about 50% of normal workload. My colleagues and clients have not really known (apart from two supportive ones whom I trust) about the cancer which was what I wanted.  With hindsight, I'm not sure my previous employer would have been flexible enough to let me work when I wanted as the appointments continued to mount up and my chemo was delayed 4 times.  Another thing to think about is the emotional bit as George & Jackie said - it's made me really question what I want out of work, and life in general looking ahead. Everyone's situation is so different though - I hope you think this through properly.  Work will always be there for you when you're finished this period.  It's really tough - both emotionally and physically - but with the right attitude, you'll be fine.  All the best - thinking of you all x",
