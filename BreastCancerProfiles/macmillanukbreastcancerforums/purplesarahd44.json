      "Content": "Hi everyone. My 68 year old mum was diagnosed with stage 2 breast cancer earlier this year. She had a very small lump removed and some lymph nodes. Her prognosis was very good. She has just had her fourth round of chemo and is finding it very difficult. She's in tears alot and very depressed. Which of course, is utterly understandable. She is currently struggling with a tight, achey,pulling sensation that radiates from under her arm, right around her back. She becomes incredibly tired and confused around four days after her treatments and is now dreading her next session. I feel so helpless and just want to be able to take the pain away. It's so difficult to know which symptoms are 'normal' and which aren't!  Xxxx ",

      "Content": "It is hormone fuelled yes. I doubt she would opt out of the chemo. We hadn't even considered that and didn't know it was a viable, effective option. We have been told that her symptoms are normal, but the severity is the issue. She's knocked for six around four days after each treatment. We are also often told that she 'has been lucky' because she has not suffered from sickness or infection! ",
