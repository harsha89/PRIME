      "Content": "Hi there - posted in \"new to site\" group and was advised to post here too.   Have always followed Macmilland donated but hoped I would never find myself here (in thenicest possible way).   Have put off going to GP for a few months, but have had intermittent pain in my armpit (only occasionally and no lump), plus some weird sensations in my left breast - tingling, stabbing, shooting pains, dull ache etc.  GP gave me a full exam and said he could feel some thickening where I had told him it was sore on occasions.  Said it could be hormonal etc etc etc (I'm on the pill), or any one of a number of harmless conditions, but all I heard was the \"C\" word as a possibility.  Has booked me for a mammogram but in my head I have convinced myself I have cancer.  Dont think I can make it through the next week or so before my scan.",

      "Content": "Am out in the sticks in Cornwall - fortunately though we have a fantastic cancer centre 10 mins up the road.  I have been divorced for 4 years so no partner to tell - which makes it harder.  Am not going to tell parents as Mum is waiting for results of biopsy she had done on her breast last week - hearing my news is prob the last thing she needs.!!  Met up with a friend today and talked to her.  She has had two scares and still has two lumps that she has had for 2 years but dr's keep telling her its nothing to worry about - ??!!  Still, it took my mind off things for a bit....are you like me and are thinking the worst possible case scenario?  I can't stop being so pessimistic.     GP didnt tell me about timescales and to be honest I was concentrating so hard on what he was saying I forgot to ask!!  It's really good that you have had your appt through already though.  Apparently you get your results on the same day.  Don't think I could bear to wait any longer!!  How is your husband taking it?  Think men prob feel pretty useless in it all... Do you keep imagining every ache and pain is something serious ?  I do....it's awful.  I just want to march up to the hospital and demand to have the mammogram TODAY!!!   Really hope things go well for you - sending you a big hug - chin up.......Kate x",

      "Content": "Oh gosh, what a terrible time you have had/ are having with all this.  Your poor husband must be thinking history is repeating itself bless him.  Your reaction \"oh happy days\" is EXACTLY the type of thing I am saying....the worst thing I did was come home from the GP and google it.  BIG MISTAKE.  I am now convinced it has spread to my bones and I need to start preparing my funeral.  Such a bloody optimist I know, but it's so hard not to think the worst.  I just want to go to hospital and DEMAND my mammogram NOW!!!  The Macmillan site and Breast Cancer site are the only two I am looking on now - too many horror stories online....it says on here that tissue thickening is a LESS common symptom, and my GP tried to reassure me it is probably hormonal.....bloody hope so....   Are you working?  If so how on earth do you concentrate - it must be so hard x  I have a week of work and then a week off so I am hoping my appt will come through before then.   From another one who waffles!!!!   Big hugs to you xx",

      "Content": "Hi Ecoelle - I'm Kate - somehow added an \"i\" in to my name when joining but never mind!!   Like you, I wasn't sure if I could join, but here we are...the place where we don't really want to be... Sounds like you got to the doctor's really quickly so well done - I have left it for probably 6 months, and now I am really kicking myself and hoping that I haven't made things worse.  GP said I will either get a phone call from the hospital, or an appt by post, but it was only when I got home that I realised I hadn't asked him how long the appt took to come through.  Looking online, it seems to be within two weeks.  If so, then I would hope to be going the same week as you.  No point telling you not to worry - I'm worried sick...for my children more than anything.  Am not going to mention it to anyone.  If the result is clear then all is well.  If not, well will cross that bridge when it comes!!  Whereabouts do you live?   Kate x",
