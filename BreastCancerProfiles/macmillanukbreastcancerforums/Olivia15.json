    "Content": "Ive been abroad 3 times since chemo and believe me I look nothing like the 10 stone version of me with blonde hair. Â The first time I went I wore a head scarf and the 2nd time I wore a wig. The did give me the 'once over' but I didn't have any problems. Just go for it, and do whatever makes you comfortable. Take more evidence, like a driving license, if you are worried . Have a lovely holiday xx",
