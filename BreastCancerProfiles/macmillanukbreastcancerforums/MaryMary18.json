      "Content": "Hi all,  Can anyone give me some advice.  I had a mastectomy nearly 5 weeks ago which went really well.  As well as the breast they also removed the lymph glands from under my right arm.  However, I am having problems with fluid build up.  I have had it aspirated 4 times but it has filled up again.  They tell me that if they keep draining the fluid off it may keep returning and I get the impression from the oncologist that he would prefer it to go naturally but he does not say that in so many words.  Does anyone know what I can do to get rid of the fluid myself.  I cannot start radiotherapy until this has cleared up. ",
