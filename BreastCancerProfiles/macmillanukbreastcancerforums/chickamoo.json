    "Content": "I dont worry about cancer coming back, although it is always a possibility....I know, but I just want to be back to the mentally strong, emotionally strong and physically strong ish person before breast cancer. I never for one moment thought when i was diagnosed almost 1 year ago that a year on I would be the way i am now, when does this end, when can I truly 'put cancer behind me'? never I feel! My employer has just decided that after 11 weeks fazed return, which i am struggling badly with and am still only up to 5 hours a day, that on 11 November I must go back full time....my options.....try it and hope it works (which i doubt) or apply for job share........I know I should be glad to simply be alive but 'god' when does it end?",
