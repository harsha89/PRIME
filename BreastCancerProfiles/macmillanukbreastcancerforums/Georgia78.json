      "Content": "This is so interesting. Thanks for sharing. Wasn\u2019t even offered or mentioned with me (op was in December and just finished radiotherapy). I would have jumped at the chance I think, or at least would have found out more about my options. As you say, when you\u2019re in that state, you just blindly trust what you\u2019re being told. Having said that, my docs initially thought I wouldn\u2019t need chemo but after further tests is now recommended. Do you think it would have any impact on that? Or is it totally unrelated to the chemo side of treatment? ",

Great to heat it paid off for you and you\u2019re doing well now. That\u2019s the motivation to see me through to the other end xx",

I\u2019ve also got myself a diary so I can note everything down, aswell as keep a symptom diary, see if that helps with understanding how/when I tend to react.",

      "Content": "hey all, new to this world and just wanted to give a wave. A bit about me, Found a lump in October after a lovely family holiday, was diagnosed in November and have since been through the lumpectomy/radiotherapy mill. On the last day of radiotherapy my consultant advised chemo to limit chances of the bugger coming back. That was last Friday. To say I\u2019m knocked for 6 is a bit of an understatement as didn\u2019t think I\u2019d need it. But it is what it is, and I\u2019d never forgive myself if it came back knowing I hadn\u2019t done all I could to stop it. that said, am totally dreading it. Have flicked through a few forums and threads and know reactions to treatment are varied so not sure what I need here really. Guess I just know I\u2019ll need some support and contact with people who\u2019ve been through it and understand the journey.  From what I\u2019ve what read so far though, so many brave souls in here. We\u2019ll get through this cos there\u2019s no option but to, right? :) x",

      "Content": "Hi Lynn, Thanks for your reply and sorry to hear you\u2019re going through it too. The more I hear from \u2018normal\u2019 people the less fearful I am. The media just overloads you with horror stories and how awful it is so it\u2019s a bit hard not to feel scared when you hear the dreaded C word (that applies for both cancer and chemo!). to be honest my onco did go through the detail of what chemo treatment I\u2019d be having but it was such a haze as there was so much to process. I want to say it was EC&T treatment? 4 round of EC and 4 rounds of the T part, each session 3 weeks apart. I have a pre-chemo chat on Tuesday so will aim to understand it more then.  Good to know about the sickness pills as I\u2019m not very good with nausea so will do my all to avoid that.  Did you go for cold cap at all? And did you find you got any headaches after treatment? I\u2019ve been offered cold cap but still in 2 minds, due to time it adds but also the stories of discomfort and headaches. Part of me is keen to try out some fun wigs and headpieces! Just to try and get some fun out of the whole thing!  Hope your next treatment goes well and effects aren\u2019t too bad this time xx",
