    "Content": "Sorry to gate crash. My hubby has lung cancer that has spread to kidney liver and spine. Has has radiotherapy on his spine for the pain and completed 4 cycle of chemo. He is here next to me better than he was before diagnosis 6 months ago. No pain and the Tumor has shrunk by 2 cm and the mets have also shrunk. He has his off days but otherwise is in perfect working order :) Of course there is hope. He was given 6 months without treatment. Still going strong. Love and hugs. Jo xx xx",
