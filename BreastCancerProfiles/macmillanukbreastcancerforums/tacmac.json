    "Content": "Hi carole, other girls are prob right re piles but remember that FEC can lower your platelet count down so it makes you bleed more easily...even though the chemo suite will be closed you should have a ward number that copes with chemop related side effects I hope...we do in my area and they can advise you until your chemo nurses are available tomorrow...hope this helps and take care Tracyx",
