    "Content": "Hey Flower20. Have just joined the online community and your thread was the first one I saw on opening the Breast Cancer group.  I am so sorry to hear your distress and can really sympathise with you. I too have a little boy who just turned 4 on New Year's Eve. My world was turned upside down with my diagnosis just before Christmas. It has been really hard to believe it was happening to me. I had waited so long for my little boy to complete our family (I also have a beautiful stepdaughter who is 9 going on 19!) and just as life was on the up after a very stressful few years of juggling a job in London, trying to be super Mum and look after my mother who has dementia (and lives with us) I decided to gear down a bit and spend some quality time with my family before my son starts school and my mother's condition really deteriorates. So I decided to take voluntary redundancy and a few month later I'm side swiped by this! I have read your thread and all the fantastic support out there which is just amazing. This is your journey and  unfortunately no one can take it for you but what I am feeling from this forum is that you are definitely not alone. Everyone's stories and experiences will add to your situation and help you to beat this. On receiving my diagnosis life has turned into a bit of a rollercoaster especially with all the emotions that  you go through. On minute I was in the depths of despair thinking about my poor little boy and what would happen if anything should happen to me. Blaming myself for being so selfish and having him so late in life. My partner is 14 years older than me and I suppose arrogantly it never occurred to me that I would be the one to get sick first. I've always just got on with it trying, and not always successfully, take things in my stride and suddenly there was something happening that I really hadn't accounted for. It completely threw me and still from time to time still does. I am a little way on from where you seem to be but today started chemotherapy and will then in May have surgery (not a mastectomy thankfully at this stage), removal of lymph nodes and then radiotherapy. There is a long way to go and when written like this seems quite daunting but am seeing this as a fight and one I am determined to win. Actually once  I knew what my treatment plan I felt better and some way back in control of my life. I urge you not to get disheartened and think the worse (as hard as at times it is) as all the advice and words of support ring very true and we are all in our own way here to help. Talking is good. It does help. So keep talking and keep posting. You will get through this - we all will. Lots of love to you and your family x",
