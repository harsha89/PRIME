      "Content": "Hi Carolyn Yeah I remember that feeling, the psychological aspect took longer than the physical part to heal.  I had Lumpectomy, chemo, radiotherapy and tamoxifen for 5 years last time. Got the same people and team with me at the moment. Had my ct scan today and got my bone scan tomorrow.  Feeling ok most of today as starting to get my head around it all but gutted its all happening again.  Hope you are ok X ",

I have been struggling to find anyone in my situation so far.  I'm so happy things are going well for you at the moment.  I'll feel much better next week once my scans come back. Pretty sure it's breast cancer again which I have my head around now. I've just got my fingers crossed for my scans which I scaring me more than anything else.  You have given me a little bit of hope in my long week of worry  Thank you  Kayla xxx ",

      "Content": "Hi Thanks for your reply. Yeah very different now since first diagnosis. Yeah I was getting checked every year. Last check was November but I found a lump on my good breast a couple of weeks ago and I have now had an ultrasound, mammogram and biopsy as of today. Got a ct scan tomorrow, bone scan on Friday and all my results next Wednesday. I do have people I can talk to. Just feels strange the second time around. Thanks for the hug. Hope you are well ",
