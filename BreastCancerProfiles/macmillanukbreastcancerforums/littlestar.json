    "Content": "HI there sorry to hear your wife has been diagnosed with breast cancer. I too have got this nasty thing. I went to GP in nov08 and i thought it was just going to be a cyst, but then i was sent to get it checked, and it turned out to be a tumour. All this just after my 25th birthday. I also have lymph node involvement. It sounds like your wife is going down the same sort of route as i am. chemo first then op and then radio after. I have finished my chemo recently had my op and now waiting to start radio. If you have any questions then please do ask, you can send me a privite message if that would be better for you. I wish your wife the best of luck with her treatment and the best thing you can do is just be there for your wife, give her support an stay positive. take care Littlestar",
