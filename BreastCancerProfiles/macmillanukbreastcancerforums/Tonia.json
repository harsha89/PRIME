      "Content": "Hi I'm not sure if I am posting this in the right place - my apologies if not. I am currently coming to the end of my breast cancer treatment (chemo and radiotheraphy) following a lumpectomy last December and I'm worried that I've found a new lump.  It's right next to the scar, so may just be scar tissue but I'm really worried!  I'm trying to get an appointment with a doctor tomorrow but in the meantime, I wondered if anyone knows whether it's possible to get another tumour whilst having chemo? Thanks for listening! Tonia xxx",

I'm sure that you're right, but as you say, it's always best to get these things checked out.  Cancer has certainly made me paranoid about everything! Thanks again xxx",

I saw my surgeon who did an ultra sound and said that it was just a build up of scar tissue. I wish to be honest now that I'd also had a mammogram just to put my mind at ease completely. Please let me know how you get on. Wishing you all the best xxxx Do you have your appointment booked yet Petrina?",
