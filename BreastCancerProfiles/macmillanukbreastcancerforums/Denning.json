      "Content": "When I had a mastectomy and reconstruction in January it was on the results of a biopsy showing a less agressive cancer than turned up on the full biopsy. My surgeon would not have done the reconstruction had ne known because of the risk of \"damage\" to the recon with follow up chemo and radiotherapy. I have my 5th chemo (of 6) next week and am then due for 5 weeks of radiotherapy. Has anyone been thro this and if so what problems did it cause to recon? I had a bck flap reconstruction with implant. Thanks Diane",

      "Content": "Hi Sue, Thanx for that....I shall have to prepare for the worst I fear on my implant and flap. As to the op, not too much discomfort considering. Its difficult to know how much compared to lymph node and breast removal. I had my op in Jan and still have numbness all around my back near the scar, although some feeling is returning. The scar is neat and is hidden by my bra. This is a mixed blessing initially after op so recommend you buy a nice soft bra to wear (which they suggest you do). At the armpit end of the scar I have what they call a cats ear (you can also get a dogs ear - depends on size!) which is as explained really. Where you are laying down for the op you end up with a sort of ear shaped flap - apparently they can tidy this up later? Hope this helps...feel free if you need to know anything else to get in touch Diane",

      "Content": "Jools has just send me your post.......I so feel for you. I am just coming out the other end and still have good days and bad. I was diagnosed on Christmas Eve last year (so all my ho ho ho turned to boo hoo hoo). And following tests and doctors appointments where my brain automatically tuned in the lalalala mode.... had a mastectomy and lymph node removal and reconstruction (back flap) on 17th Jan. Like you I was told I had DCIS but as luck wouldn't have it it turned out to be a Grade 3 aggressive blighter that had spread to most (21) of my lymph nodes. I had 5 months of chemo and finished nearly 6 weeks of rt mid Sept. The good news? And addressing your question? My recon had survived quite well. There were hiccups and worries along the way which I would be more than happy to talk to you about so as not to bore everyone on here. I will PM you my home phone. I had my rt at Mount Vernon and the lovely radiographers there said my recon was great ....and no it wasn't a plastic surgeon who did it for me. When I researched him on the net he had done some time at a gender relalignment hospital so thank god I woke up with just a lookey likey breast and not an Adams Apple!! Like you I am single but haven't quite given up hope yet.......altho haven't managed to find a guy on line looking for a one boobed folliclely challenged middle aged women with chemo induced hot flushes and a shortened life expectancy.......... Lots of love and please call me if you would like to chat.",

I had to have mine in my groin due to the thrombosis but it was so much easier in so many ways....so good luck.....just a thought but if the PCT don't play ball could you apply for a grant from Macmillan to pay for the Cath? Just another idea to put in the melting pot. Diane x",

      "Content": "Hi Treeze, Thinking of you this week...its going to be a tough one and as Jools said the waiting is the worst. I have found denial a great coping mechanism!! I just let in what I need to know and deal with on any one day!! Not how I used to deal with things....like you I have been the coper and carer that the extended family turn to. But no more!! Trying to take everything on board and deal with all eventaulitities was too much for me so it is now very much one step at a time. Like you I have BC...my tumour was 7cm too and a Grade 3 with 21 of my lymph nodes joining in for good measure. I had my last session of chemo last week and it was a long slog.....but you will get there!! I am awaiting 5 weeks of radio starting in August which everyone tells me is a walk in the park by comparison. Do PM me if you think of any questions someone who has been there may be able to answer or may meet you in the chatroom sometime.....I have found that a great support so hope you will too. with love Diane",

      "Content": "Hi Caroline, Like you I had 3 FECs then 3 taxoteres and was told the latter was much worse. As I had had a pretty dire time on the well named FEC (cos it was indeed fecking horrible!!) I was absolutely dreading the taxotere. In fact, it was much easier than the FEC. Yes I had some days when I was wiped out (after being like the Duracell bunny on the stay awake steroids) but nothing like as bad. I had also heard about the nails.....enough already...not enought I've lost a breast and most of my hair...but I bought some OPI Naill Envy and some nail oil to apply and I still have an immaculate french polish. I did get the numbness in my toes and a bit of discoloration on toe nails but I didn;t treat them.. One lady on it told me the reason she painted her nails black was because her nails went so discoloured. Lots of luck tomorrow Diane",
