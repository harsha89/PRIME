I went to the GP fully expecting her to roll her eyes at me and tell me it was something normal due to breastfeeding and send me on my way again. I didn\u2019t even tell my partner I\u2019d found a lump never mind going to the docs about it. I wasn\u2019t expecting to be referred to be seen within 2 weeks, and certainly wasn\u2019t expecting a phone call from the clinic to book me in 4hrs after leaving the GP.xx",

I\u2019m glad your daughter is in remission and hopefully her immune system will build up over time? It must be unbelievably worrying for you though, and caring for 2 people means you barely have time to even think about yourself. I hope you can find some time to look after yourself too. So do you not receive biopsy results there and then at the appointment? I was assuming it would be all results from all tests. Sending hugs to you too xx",

Have you got an appointment booked or waiting for a date?  With a nearly 7 month old and a 3.5yr old I\u2019ve got plenty to keep me busy, but even that is not enough to fully keep my mind off it. This morning I\u2019ve been to the supermarket, driving home I was sat at the front of a queue at red traffic lights, the lights turned green and I still sat there for god knows how long before I was snapped back to reality by beeping horns. Have you been able to feel the lump now your doc has found it?xx ",

To be honest, I don\u2019t reckon half the blokes would even know what a breast pump was if they came across one\u201d I know what you mean about coping better on your own, I feel the same way.

My appointment isn\u2019t until this Thursday, and think I will be out my mind with worry before then, each day the possible outcome seems to sink in a bit more. I have a baby and a preschooler and I\u2019m so so scared for their future if the outcome is bad for me.xx",

      "Content": "Ahh I\u2019m glad you\u2019ve got your dog to help you through, what breed is he/she? Dogs are always happy to see you and seem to know when you just need that snuggle. Luckily my little boy goes to nursery on the day I have my appointment. I was debating whether to try find someone to look after the baby while at the appointment as it\u2019s a one stop clinic so I think all tests and results in one day, so there for a few hrs.  BUT (bit of an embarrassing story here...) I\u2019m breastfeeding at the mo. I was planning on taking my breast pump so I could empty them before the tests rather than have milk squirting all over. We had a very rare night out on Saturday, I got VERY VERY drunk, I lost my pump out my bag. So I\u2019m going to have to take her along to drain me, haha! I hope your appointment is soon and you\u2019re not left waiting another week between. I suppose I\u2019m quite lucky I only had/have a week between seeing GP and the clinic appt, even that feels like a lifetime, but on the other hand getting a call a few hrs after leaving the GP surgery has made me even more worried that it\u2019s not good. I was convinced the doc would tell me it wasn\u2019t anything to be worried about.xx",

      "Content": "So just a little update.  I had my appointment at the breast clinic today. They can\u2019t cant tell me they are 100% sure until my biopsy results come back........but they have told me it is \u201chighly highly HIGHLY likely\u201d I have breast cancer, so basically I do but they need it on paper. They have told me I\u2019m looking at a lumpectomy for the 2.5-3cm lump and definitely radiotherapy if it\u2019s only a lumpectomy, and more than likely chemo due to me being \u2018young\u2019 (36), but need my biopsy results to see what type of cancer they are dealing with before they can create the treatment plan. We\u2019ve also been asked to seriously think about if we have completed our family (with our 3.5yr old and 7month old) and they need to know ASAP as I will be referred to another hospital (I\u2019m assuming for egg harvesting??) if not. Wow, my mind is blown!",
