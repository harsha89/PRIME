    "Content": "Hi I came across this group by accident and would normally have just gone straight to my group (bereaved spouses) but read the blogs and just wanted to say something - hope you don't mind. My Annie had a scar on her left boob that caused a kind of dent and also later on developed lymphodema in her arm which at the end caused it to swell up to three times the size and lymph fluid also went around her neck and near the other arm . She also developed nasty dark skin under her chin and cancer nodules on her arm and skin - this during the last 2 months . Was she any less beautiful to me - no way - I loved her deeply inside and out for she was my Annie for 37 year and just as beautiful to as the day I met her . When you really love someone you see beyond the superficial and love the complete person so wait until you meet that person and you will see for yourself Hudson",
