      "Content": "Hi All Thought I would just write to get some of my feelings out. I am 27 years old and just been diagnosed with breast cancer - have had one lumpsectomy already and due to have another next week before chemo, etc. Is it usual to feel like you cant really speak to people (family and friends, etc)? I just feel like I dont even know how I feel at the moment???? Also I dont know whether I can stand people asking me if I feel okay - cos at the moment the answer is no!!!!! Di xÂ ",

      "Content": "Hi Paula Sorry to hear about your news. Must still pretty much be in shock mode at the moment too. I guess we beat their statistics .... just frustrated as it took me so long to convince doctor that something wasnt right in the first place and all they kept saying is it was nothing as I was under 30.... xxxx",
