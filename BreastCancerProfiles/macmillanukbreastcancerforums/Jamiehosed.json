      "Content": "Hi everyone, its been a long time since I have posted on here , but have been reading everyday.   Quick update had TNBC lumpectomy and one node removed. All margins and node where clear. Then had 6 Dosataxol and Carboplatin . the first one was a little painful and I had a reaction so they gave me a picc line. That was loads better. Side effects where manageable did have to have two units of Blood just after the 5 lot of chemo as I was anaemic. Hair started to fall out after the first chemo so got my husband to shave it of, made me feel loads better. Then had 4 weeks of daily Monday to Friday radiotherapy, which again was ok. Finished that on the 7th December just over 3 months ago.   So all should be looking up. All through the treatment I felt ok not worried not upset nothing, most of the time I was just shattered through the chemo. I was very positive. I have now got several small hard lumps in my breast where the lump was and cant lift my arm up as high as I could even after my op. also on the opposite side of the breast to the lump is very tender. I did have an appointment with my Oncologist a couple of weeks ago and told him. He had a good old feel and said that my nodes felt ok and he did say that it was very lumpy. The out come was I am due my first Mammogram on the 7th of next month and he said that I would get an appointment with my surgeon through soon as well.   I don\u2019t know if it is now that I have more time to myself and feel a lot better in my self health wise that I am now thinking more about what has happened to me or what. But now I am half convinced that the lumps and the tenderness means that it has not gone and that I am going to have to go through it all again! I am more worried now than I was when i was been treated! It just doesn\u2019t make sense to me. My mind is telling me that I know I am ok and more than likely worrying over nothing but my heart is telling me that it has not gone it feels like it did when they called me back from my last mammogram a year ago when they found the lump call it a sick sense.   Any way sorry if I have gone on, and for more than likely making a mountain out of a mole hill. But I just needed to tell someone that might know how I feel. My friend that has been through this all with me told me I was being silly, but she doesn\u2019t know how I feel.   Any way keep smiling everyone",

      "Content": "I had a lumpectomy done the end of last month and had a couple of lymph nods taken at the same time. My scar is just over half a circle around the top half of my nipple, right on the edge. So i think when the glue that she put over the stitches has come of i wont see much scar at all. I was lucky as the surgeon managed to get the lymph nods out with out having to cut me under my arm.",

      "Content": "It is just over a year ago that I finshed my chemo and i had 6 lots of it try ginger tea. I ended up have thrush in my mouth two or times with it as well so as it has beeb said wash your mouth out with salt water. Went for my check up last week with the surgeon and she said all the pain i am getting at the moment is due to the chemo and should go in the next six months. I also got the stomach cramps not nice , mine where usually in the early hours of the morning . Stick with it it gets better. Gentle hugs  Wendy x",

      "Content": "Hi Dee/KiwiCardi I am on the same chemo as you and have just had no 5 of 6 this morning. I was like you with the first on bad stomach cramps then running to the loo. Second one not so bad with the stomach but very sleepy. Then i had oral thrush with the third one. With the last one no four i was so sleepy and no energy at all for ten days a little better for the rest of the time but not as good as before. Went for my bloods on the Tuesday and they phoned me to let me know i was ok for my chemo today , but she started asking me questions about being tired or out of breath , the thing is i had noticed it on the  Tuesday and when i told her i was tired and had got out of breath a little she told me my red blood cells where low i i would need to go in on Friday for a transfusion. So of i shall go tomorrow, the nurse told me that about 8 out of 10 would need a transfusion at some point the the chemo that i am on as one of them, cant remember which one it was now, efects the bone marrow where the red blood cells are made . She told me my count was 97 and they only give a transfusion if it drops lower than 100 . And as this chemo will more than like drop it low again they want it ok for my last chemo. So fingers crossed. Hope you manage to avoid the transfusion at any point.  Wendy xx",
