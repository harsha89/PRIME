    "Content": "bs, you wrote there is nothing more you can do for the children, but actually wait, putting yourself through chemo is pretty horrible and a big brave decision, but you are doing it so that you will be there for them for years to come and see them grow up. What harder thing than that could you be doing right now? Having to quit breastfeeding abruptly, that happened to me too (for a different reason, I wasn't well) but it also screws up your hormones and makes you feel horrid, weepy, sore and unappreciated for a while, but that does get much better in a few weeks as your own body adjusts. I felt so guilty about that too and such a failure, but like they said, bottle milk from mum is better than no mum, and my baby came through it fine. Come to think of it, I was a bottle-baby anyhow, as my own mother wasn't coping too well, and yet I'm here to tell the tale... Can social services (hospital should have a social worker attached) get you any help with child-care or a place at a nearby creche so you can go off and sleep a few hours, just time for you? Good luck!",
