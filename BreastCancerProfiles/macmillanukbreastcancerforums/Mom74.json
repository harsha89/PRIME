I've just done chemo 2 of 6. I also have the smoothest armpits I've ever had in my life - that's a bonus!! I could be an armpit model! Yes I'm also piling on the pounds too....

Especially as they've seen me change through treatment (losing hair and energy). It took time even for me to start to comprehend this and I still vary with my emotions day to day (today was not a good day for the lady from CAMHS to tell me they can't offer support for my son restarting school at 13 after exclusions - think she wished I didn't answer the phone). Be patient with them and yourself, it really is an unexpected journey x Gillian ",

My kids are 10 and 13, the 13 year old though has behavioural problems and is emotionally about age 7. Thanks for replying-it's so tiring and a strange new world. I want to go back to my old life. I spoke with the chemo nurse last night, she thinks the filgrastin injections I'm using might be making me feel like this - last one today so hopefully better soon.",

My husband is totally unused to taking care of things (although he is trying), and the kids are being fabulous although they are being rocked by the diagnosis too. I am waiting on genetic tests and the 6cycles of TAC before deciding on what surgery will be x",

You don't have to have chemo, I could have chosen just to have surgery and radiotherapy, but the risk that it had spread further made chemotherapy a logical choice (hair seems a small sacrifice - although I'm not looking forward to losing it x).
