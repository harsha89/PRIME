Sick note meand presisly what it says, you are sick! my husband had just finished, 12 rounds of chemo and no way could he have gone to work. He looked and felt terrible. I can't believe a manager would actually have the balls to suggest it! God this makes me so mad. God help him if one of his/her family where going through this.  Go to work throw up in the desk and get s taxi home on the firm!! sorry, some people are so self absorbed, take your business glasses of mate!!!
