      "Content": "Hi all, just a small rant really to get it off my chest... Pardon the pun, a brief history of my breast cancer, I found a lump in April I was referred to breast screening, within 3 weeks had needle biopsies ( was still working) another 2 weeks waiting for results, turned out I had breast cancer, I bit of a shock, then the whirlwind started, and I'm sure you will all know the path, nuclear medicine, scans, lymph removed, to determine, what's what, I had a full right breast mastectomy with implant which I had for 3 weeks, but sadly my body rejected, I'm now happy with my body minus boob, The main point that is getting my back up is, I was off work all told 4 1/2 months, mainly due to surgery, I'm not one to be off work, and my sickness record is good, think I'd been off once in two years, I work as a nurse in the NHS, and have been back on phased return, all wells but I got told by my line manager I was on a stage 3 sickness, i know she is just following policies, I will be on this stage for 3 months if I'm not off in that time period, I don't want a medal or any special treatment, but I can not promise I'm not going to be off, as being on tamoxifen I'm feeling worn out sometimes, I'm just a bit shocked to the lack of understanding towards the emotional effects its had on me, has anyone else had similar moments",
