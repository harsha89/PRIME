      "Content": "Hi Judi, thanks for your reply. It is difficult to make the decision about chemo, especially knowing I could just walk away and heal after the surgery. However I do feel positive about  Herceptin in prevention of cancer re-acuring. Also my family history is not great with quite a few different cancers in my mother's blood line. A shorter course of chemo makes sense to me, maybe AC or TC. I am meeting my oncologist again on Tuesday and finalise the treatment plan.  Very good luck to you too, hope you keep feeling fine. Btw, did you try the cold cap? Any hair loss yet? I am asking as I want to keep teaching until the end of this term and my chemo would start around mid November. Many thanks. Beatrice",

      "Content": "I have been advised to have chemo even after all my cancer has been removed. This is so I can be given Herceptin as I am HER2 positive and the cancer was grade 3. I want to have the least impact on my body and now looking at the different chemo regimen suggested by my oncologist. One is for 18 weeks, 3 doses of FEC, then 3 doses of Taxol (during which they can start with the Herceptin) or 12 weeks, 4 doses of AC followed by Herceptin. He also mentioned DC treatment with Taxol. I would appreciate any feedback on either treatment, side effects etc. Thanks.  B",
