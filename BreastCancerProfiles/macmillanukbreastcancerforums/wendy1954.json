Thanks for that advise, sounds like a good idea , as I always sleep on my tummy or my side, never on my back, so will try this pillow to see if I can mange to sleep on my back with it ! sitting slightly up I suppose ! Will they let me take a little cushion into hospital with me? or is that for when I get home? Good luck with the radiotherapy, not sure if Ive got to have that yet, but probably will , most people seem to. Thanks for the advice. big hug ! Wendy",

I still have to take co-codomol in the mornings though as hip pains are really bad still, especially in the mornings, and I am 9 weeks from my last Tax. So the side effects dont always go away immediatly with some people, like me, unfortunately. Hope it works out better for you. Good luck with the rest of your Tax. Wendy x",

I had my sentinal nodes removed on Friday (I have now spent all evening and part of the night in loo, with bad stomach ! not sure if that is supposed to happen with the radio active dye of whether the hospital food did it! I have an appointment on Thursday with the plastic surgeon to talk about re-construction, Im thinking why ???????????? Surely I need to know the extent of my cancer first and whether its worth having a re construction? I havent had a MRI scan, most people on here seem to have had one, I was diagnosed on the 1st February, as 99% probable, confirmed on the 8th Feb, sentinal node removal on the 17th Feb, now plastic surgeon on the 28th Feb, I appear to be missing the results somewhere along the line of the results of whether its spread to lymph nodes ! Maybe the plastic surgeon may know? its all so confusing. How long is it since youve been diagnosed? and at what point did you have an MRI scan? Anyone else here in the same situation as me??",

Have you had your sentinel nodes removed for testing yet? or do you not need to? I came out of hospital after one night in, expecting a very sore arm, which it is, but feel a lot worse after picking up a gastro bug in there aswell! spent all last night and most of the day visiting the loo ! im not sure what hurts most underarm or tummy pains !!

Mine hurt whilst Im typing this !! Good luck, yours may not come off at all, just letting you know the possibilities ! I did paint mine black all through chemo too, didnt seem to help though !

I asked my Oncologist if I was to have scan after, but he told me no too. When I asked why, he said you have no other symptoms. How he knows I have no other symptoms, I dont know ! I think we have to wait and see if we get any symptoms before they offer us a scan! Its is nothing to do with being triple negative kittykat, as I am also and had 5cm invasive tumour with 1 lymph node involved, so I reckon its just different hospital policies. I am now in limbo land, not knowing if its spread or not ! same as you Michele! I think its to do with financial cuts at our hospital, I have heard they are in a bit of trouble financially and scans are expensive. Hope all goes well for you Wendy x",

Thats me, other people are different, my problems really were on the gastric side, bad constipation, then the opposite ! and weakness. I think this is quite common with most people, some manage to work, some dont, so it depends on your reaction and maybe finances pushing you to go back !

How are you getting on? especially with the node clearance, Im still pretty sore after the SNB taking out just 2 nodes, Im dreading them removing all of them (and my breast as well of course!) All this lymphodema  that you can get afterwards terrifies me, Im thinking Im always going to have a large swollen arm ! surgeon says even if you get an insect bite it can swell up, and mozzies just love me ! How are you coping after the MX and clearance? I have invasive dcis grade 2 or above (they cant tell me until theyve removed it, so not sure yet, )also lump 4cm roughly is all I know . Im having expansion implant at the same time, but they said not sure if I will need chem or rads yet till after MX. Bit worried about possibility of no chem/rads as everyone else here seems to have had it ! Can you advise me what I should expect after the operation? thanks Wendy",

Wishing you the best results for your scan  and fingers crossed it will be clear. Its strange, I never felt any tenderness or pain with my lump, but since the core biopsy and the SNB removal. Ive had painful boob, gone hard and a funny colour around the nipple, sort of yellow ! wasnt like that before ! I asked BC nurse she said it was probably bruising, I dont know but it now looks like I have got something really weird going on in there !  When do you start your rads? before the scan or afterwards?
