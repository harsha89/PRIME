I'm not sure if you're a pillow person (I wasn't) but after op I had at least two pillows as it helped avoid feeling strained when lying down in bed. Pps. Grapes, figs and canned prunes! (Nice in yoghurt) to offset the er...blocking effects - ahem - of the painkillers! Ppps. Don't worry about clicking the buzzer in the night if you feel uncomfortable or hurty too much to sleep post op, as any probs can be quickly resolved. Ppps. I found oddly sparkly orange juice in a can the most refreshing!  Bye for now!:-)",

      "Content": "Hi Amy, To reassure you, on a more positive note, everyone finds chemo and radio affects them differently, and it doesn't necessarily, fortunately, have too negative an impact on everyone.  Re the tattoos for radiotherapy- they help ensure the radiation is directed most efficiently and accurately and they are hardly noticeable, though I guess people have different perspectives; some may say they are like a small freckle. The best, accurate and comprehensive advice seems to come from the Macmillan website itself and the range of booklets they do; and indeed, asking your Macmillan nurse and staff who do pre-treatment reviews. Take care now. x",

I kept them fastened and wriggled it on as putting arm behind bod was a tad tricky straight after op; but you may have a jolly helpful person with you. Ok thanks, finished radiotherapy last week after chemotherapy so things are moving along! Will be thinking of you and the op. The bonus side was I had the best sleep in a very long time when I had the anaesthetic!:-) cheerio!",

      "Content": "My Macmillan nurse suggested cheap cotton sports bras from Asda and they do a two pack - black/white for £8. Can honestly say they were the best purchase as I wore them post-surgery (surgeon said it would stop over-stretching and provide support, and was ok on the drains as wasn't wired) and now in bed to support my reconstruction.  Wore vests with support(easy to put on without stretching arms up/out) and (stretchy) jersey tops and cardigans to avoid stretching arms over head too much Re: drains - my Macmillan nurse showed me a genius solution! Essentially a length of soft bandage twice round my waist and the drains looped on it so I literally could tuck my jersey tops over the top near the top of my jeans, and they were invisible with only slight bulge.  Take care. Sleep as much as you can, take the painkillers, and the drains will soon be a distant memory.x",

      "Content": "hello there, I was diagnosed a week after my 40th, back at start of Sept. I had a mastectomy and immediate reconstruction two weeks ago and was told today that yes, due to it having been so near the muscle wall - the more than 5cm multi focal tumour area- that I would need chemo and then radiotherapy. Bother!! where I live in Kent nowhere offers egg treatment unlike Bart's in London but they won't take me as I'm out of their catchment... the other thing to consider, the surgeon said is that treatments to save eggs wouldn't be advisable given they would pump me full of oestrogen- exactly the opposite of what I need...plus there's no guarantee use of eggs in future would work. Post-chemo, she said my chances of ovaries working would be ca 25-30%, but perhaps not as high as I'm 40, not 30. Also, there's no guarantee healthcare from employer would cover cost and as I'm not in London couldn't get it on the NHS and couldn't afford hefty costs. so, what to do....? the thought of it being so final after chemo or at least very unlikely of having kids feels me with a weird sense of 'oh dear I'd never have thought I wouldn't' - to say the least - I'm not very good at explaining such things. yes, a chance, but minuscule. however, my head tells me, as the surgeon did, that doing anything in terms of increasing oestrogen is foolish given it's been a main positive trigger for my BC it seems. then again, I've had it and it's being dealt with, so should I try and do the egg thing? but then pregnancy itself would be a 9 month stint of oestrogen-tastic, so again foolish in terms of preventing a return etc. this is to be considered pre starting chemo - should start in ca 4 weeks before radiotherapy.... what a quandary. I think I know I shouldn't bother with egg things, but the finality of knowing it's extreeeemly unlikely I'll be able to have children is hmm, how shall I say? All a bit odd, to put it mildly. any similar experiences? Thoughts? Suggestions? All welcome!! thank you!    ",

      "Content": "Dear Grogg, Thanks for taking the time to reply. To answer your question as best I can, yes, I had always thought one day I would have children, thought yes, it would happen at some point, albeit having let time tick by, but due to relationship change of situation late 30s, good I didn't earlier. However, that also meant we didn't start a family and split up so no one with whom to have a child. Anyhow, if it happens in future it happens. I suppose it's the finality that due to chemo which is a reality and needs treatment now, more time will tick by and plus chemo means even less likely after despite it not being my choice. The inconvenience of cancer, eh?! Blooming thing.  I'm glad fertility treatment worked for you when you had it and you've got a family. I wish you all the best too, with this pesky business that has brought us together here. Bye for now.    ",

      "Content": "Hello there, it's different for all, but for me there wasn't any hesitation about having immediate reconstruction. I'd thought that having one lot of surgery and period of discomfort was better than two lots, say with delayed reconstruction. I thought that having immediate reconstruction would make me feel there was less of a change and BC having less of an impact - despite it all still having of course an impact! - but it has made me feel better having had it done. It's almost like I've not had a mastectomy. re the double.... I think you said there was a family history?  And about keeping things similar looking. I've fortunately not had to consider the former but I still got it in one without history and so that hasn't made any difference. We read all about 'risk factors'and likewise none applied to me. i have thought since perhaps I should have gone for a double, and don't know why really, just to definitely avoid having to go through surgery a second time I suppose. sorry, I realise I'm waffling... I only had surgery two weeks ago but am pleased I had the reconstruction as it's less - for me, at least- 'hey, I'm being treated for BC!!', than I think it would have been for me otherwise. Sorry I can't send any pics re appearance as it's all still under plasters, but am glad it's been done. Take care and good luck and if any of my waffle was helpful, good o, or if you have any questions re surgery, I'll try my best to help.x",

      "Content": "Ps. The drains for implants were removed  - 1 after10 days from the Bottom middle of the left side and last Friday - 2 weeks post op the other drain on the outside of my chest was removed. This wasn't painful just a bit tender and the odd burny feeling but actually ok. i didn't get the dressings and drains wet at all - invest in baby wipes - Johnson and Johnson first touch(?) white packet ca £2.50 have been a good investment whilst not being allowed to shower and treat yourself to getting a simple hair wash - seems to be about £8-10 - but I stand facing over the sink, towel on face - as I wouldn't want to lean back in a hairdresser chair. Turning over in bed is a bit of a pig, but unexpectedly, I find lying on my back easy enough to drop off! Turning left or right to sleep is done tentatively - wearing support in bed would help - check with your surgeon re drains and bra/ sports' top as I had two opinions - the more senior  said yes, do wear to support, stop the skin stretching due to weight of implant and helps stop swelling. Rightyho, enough waffle.....take care! :-) Pps. I shan't be going back to running just yet two weeks post op! The very thought of bouncing makes me think eek! still I reckon in a couple of weeks....perhaps... So fear not!",

She called her surgeon 'Smiley Surgeon' and instinctively liked him, so that made me think of what you've just said about yours....And it's given me some insight into what chemo might be like - though I know it's different for all, but now I know since last Monday that chemo is going to start in December and then radiotherapy - bummer, thought I'd got away with that...- it was helpful as for me, I like to have as much info as poss....

      "Content": "Ps. It was an implant. Is the alternative one where bits of your bottom or tummy are used?  The reasoning for implant was mainly as I, nor my surgeon, thought there was a need to disrupt other bits of my bod, plus further discomfort, and also the technique with a dermamatrix used as a sling at the bottom and connecting it by pulling over the muscle from the top over the implant seemed like a very clever technique.  I'm not massive, so I don't know whether that was a factor for not having to have, is it flaps?, but in any case, the technique offered seemed a great one.  I'm not sure if we can mention surgeons on here, but Miss Seethram is absolutely amazing. I feel very fortunate to have had her, her registrar Alyssiya illeyenva , radiographer Marcie Turner and Mrs Rossitrr, and a  really great Macmillan nurse called Sylvia and nursing and surgical team (in Kent). anyhoooo, good luck and if I can help with further waffle any more, do shout.x",

So I'm surprised, as I'd anticipated having to be on pain relief for longer. Don't get me wrong, and not wanting to mislead you, the muscle part of my left chest is tender but not pain pain, more of a gentle hurty ache that feels better when it's at rest. However, I can walk, talk, cough ....pesky cough! .... And it's ok.:-) Post-surgery I was in hospital for just about 4 days and I took every pain relief going so fear ye not... There are means of coping with it! Oramorph, tramadol and codeine at various points. Came off oramorph after 10 days and after some discomfort realised tramadol wasn't cutting the mustard and really didn't need it. Yes, tender, yes, tight, but ultimately really bearable. First week is the worst, as you'd expect but when I say the worst, I don't mean 'aggggh!' More that I got tablets/ morphine and I slept a lot but also could quite readily sit and chat with visitors. No writhing in agony, gosh no, so don't panic. I'd never been in hospital before, and never been one for drugs, more of a merry tipple for me, and oooh la la the odd paracetamol and codeine for a headache! So it will be better than you may be fearing.xx    ",
