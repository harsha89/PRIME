      "Content": "Hi, This is the first time I've started a discussion so hope this is in the right place! Can I ask which thermometers people have got please? We had an older ear one from when the kids were babies but the BCN suggested a new modern one would be a good investment. I've only had one cycle of chemo and am already on abx because my picc line became infected, so I'm acutely aware of keeping an eye on everything (and just read the Sepsis thread). I have a new ear thermometer but must be a bit rubbish with it as I get different readings in each ear - my right ear is consistently 0.3 or even 0.4 degrees warmer... So I ordered a mouth thermometer - which now reads almost full degree lower than my ears. My question is - which is the most reliable site for a reading? My mum suggested adopting a \"best of 3 approach\" which I suspect isn't clinically reliable ;) Thank you pepper,",

Mine, where I have 28 years with a large multi-national so all standard policies, is I get full pay for 6 months, then I think it's ssp (I need to check that!). Leave is cumulative for each year, so I was off for 8 weeks, have worked this week but have chemo next week so that'll be week 9. I would at the very least ask them to confirm in writing that they have a) received your phased plan and b) their plans re your salary. Are you due back soon under the plan, so you know when you'll get full pay again, or are you worried they may not take you back? I'm a  little unclear from your post if it's the job or the pay, sorry!",

      "Content": "Hi Sue, we are having the same treatment and I had a very similar experience. Initially the lump was expected to be about 2cm, I had an extra MRI and they thought it was maybe 3cm - at surgery it was 4cm. I was also expecting 15 x rads and because my sentinel lymph node was positive I am also having chemo. I was devastated when they added in the chemo to the treatment plan, and you feel like you have no control over what's to come, and no idea how many more surprises there are. But have had the first cycle of TC and, as others said, it is doable. It was only 2 weeks ago so too early to see if the cold cap worked (which also wasn't as bad as I expected!). Mine is lobular breast cancer and they have advised me I'll also need to have my ovaries removed after the rads - also a surprise! I'm just taking each experience at a time at the moment and trusting they are giving me the best advice and treatment.",

I had no way of knowing if the others were cancerous too, so had the choice to have rads or a full clearance to the armpit. I opted for the... radiotherapy\"   I hope that makes more sense!!",

      "Content": "Hi @nicolaangie66 I'm much the same as helsbels18 radiotherapy to the armpit instead of clearance after many discussions with my surgeon and oncologist. For me, the outcomes (risk of recurrence) are the same, with lower risks for rads than surgery. I'm comfortable with that decision. I did have 4 chemo cycles as well - my cancer is lobular, margins around the tumour very fine (0.5mm) and LCIS in the margins which tipped me into the chemo bin so not quite the same as you. When I had made my decision (and the choice was very much mine) both the oncologist and the surgeon agreed it was the right choice. Hope that helps pepper",

      "Content": "Hi nicolaangie66  I'm actually still having radiotherapy, today was day12 of 15 standard blasts then I have 5 boosters next week. My skin is very pathetic too, I was allergic to nearly all the dressings during surgery and chemo and have some nasty marks still 5 weeks post PICC removal. This is partly why I opted for rads not surgery, but I was reassured by the stats and I know that neither my surgeon nor my oncologist would have given me a choice if surgery were the better option. I still have a niggle under my arm from the SNB and I'm told that will likely remain the case now but it's annoying rather than painful - right at the top of where most underwired bras end, so I'm still not back in my old bras (with any shape!) Anyhow, the rads were pretty much a non event for the first say 8 sessions then my skin became a bit red and this week it's definitely sore but not unbearable. They suggested on Fri that I may wish not to wear a bra this week. I tried that yesterday but my nipple became so sore rubbing on my T-shirt I was utterly miserable. Today I'm wearing my post surgery crop top which is a much better compromise! I hope that helps - good luck with the onco appointment. pepper",
