    "Content": "Hi Helen, Yes I agree totally.  I am a 'survivor' and was given the advice by a friend who had had her left breast removed that in her research its best to keep your body in an Alkaline state and there is a book on Amazon thats worth a read called The Alkaline Cure. A Vegan diet is the best way to go in my opinion. It  just cuts out the food group you don't need.  I have heard this thing about Soya so there seems to be a concerned opinion that it is not a good product to use whilst under treatment. Olive oil is good so stick to this. After all its not the oil that makes for weight gain its the sugar! hidden and otherwise. There are loads of recipes for Vegan/Vegetarian diet just goole it.  I found  the Veggie diet  a lot cheaper on my weeks shopping! ",
