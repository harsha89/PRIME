    "Content": "Hello My first mamo was Summer 2017 and I was told everything was clear. About 3 weeks ago I found what feels like a very obvious lump in my right breast. I was taking my bra off and ran my hands over my breasts to see if they were tender/swollen in lue of my unpredictable periods (I am 50 and on the cusp of menopause) and there it was, plain as day. Now, I am 95% sure it was not there two weeks prior because at my age you have to pluck the odd hair from my nipples and in order to find those hairs there's a lot of lifting and twisting and pushing down areas etc and I cannot imagine I could have not felt it from doing that when I found it so easily from just running my hand over it. I had a good feel under my armpits nothing sore or lumpy there.  My partner touched it and he immediatly felt it too. We both said \"cyst\" but i went to my doctors the very next day and she had a feel claiming she did not think it was cancer as \"you tend not to forget how cancer feels after you have felt it and yours moves about too\" but she booked me in on the 2 week ruling anyway  I attended the breast clinic on Thursday last and had 2 seperate mammograms (second was so they could see the breasts from the sides) and then an ultrasound and then biopsies. It was at this point I knew something was wrong she spent longer than I expected and looked at my armpit so i asked her \"Is it a cyst?\" \"Is it a fibroid?\" \"Is it a benign lump?\"  I cant remember her exact words but something like \"No its not a cyst or a fibroid and I would be very surprised if it wasn't cancer but totally treatable!\" I burst out crying. She told me one of my lymph nodes was \"borderline\" (I assume bigger than 1cm just) and added \"It could be normal for you but just being cautious\"  The consultant met me after with myy husband and again I cannot remember it all I was in shock. She said \"It looks like its cancer based on what we have seen. Its 2cm which is not too big, there's only 1 lump, some women have two or more and its contained and even if the lymph node comes back abnormal its still contained\" (That doesnt make sense to me if its in the lymph node surely its not contained?)  She said we would probably use chemotherapy because I am young and if its a fast growing tumour they tend to respond better to chemo than slow growing tumours\"   She told me that what I can feel is not the lump as the lump is deep down (I think she said under my breast) so I am feeling flesh being pushed up by the lesion. This scares me for some reason. PLUS it started giving me stabbing pains a few days prior to the appointment.  She told me i needed to take this week and let it sink in so that when I go back for the results I am in the right frame of mind to discuss treatment plans. And that 86% of ALL breast cancers from the large lumps to the early lumps were successfully treated  I am a mess. I am not at all positive I darent google anything because im a hypochondriac and a worrier by nature. ",
