      "Content": "Agree, PET scan is not scary, just a long day and boring, drinking lots of water and sitting around. My waiting room was freezing as was the scan room. I had no music, just lay there moving through a big doughnut machine. I hate enclosed spaces and MRI scans freak me out though I have had many but I was fine with the PET.",

      "Content": "I had four drains following a double mastectomy. Managed to get rid of two after three days but went home with two. Complete pain in the arse! Visited my nurse for 9 days before they were removed. Though they made life awkward just think of all the rubbish they are removing that would otherwise make life even worse! It's not that bad it being removed, not sore just uncomfortable. If you take as deep a breath as you can before and exhale whilst its being removed you hardly notice it coming out! Keep your chin up you will get there. Mine drained loads then seemed to suddenly practically stop!",
