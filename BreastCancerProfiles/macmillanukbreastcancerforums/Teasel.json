      "Content": "Hi Michelle. The Grade 3 tumour is the most aggressive form and spreads quickly. I had enlarged lymph nodes under my arm and apparently cancer cells were found in the lymph nodes. It was the enlarged lymph node that made me see my GP. I must have different chemo to you with being Her2 neg as I don't have any red stuff, mine is all clear. I am undertaking a clinical trial because I am negative so that adds a bit of extra time onto my chemo. I choose to have the chemo before surgery as I wanted to zap my body as early as possible. I see you go shopping in Warrington so I assume you live in Cheshire. Are you having your treatment at Christies in Manchester? I am as I live in South Cheshire near to Crewe so my chemo and radiotherapy will be at Christies and my surgery at my local hospital. After having my 2nd chemo a week ago I have felt very tired and achy this last week and found I had to rest alot. I am hoping that I pick up again next week. Anyway hope all goes well with your treatment, it is nice to be able to talk with people who are going through the same thing as yourself.  would love to keep intouch. xx",

      "Content": "Hi, I am new to this site to and had my second dose of chemo last monday (12th). I just take paracetamol for the headache. I have a Grade 3 tumour and am Her2 neg. I am lucky in some respects that I am used to hospital treatment as I have been in an out of hospital with a spinal problem since I was 11 years old. However I am also finding that I don't think it has sank in yet that I have cancer. I'm abit like you Michelle and like to be in control of things but at the moment I'm feeling a bit confused as everything has happened so fast. I was diagnosed on 8th Aug and like I say have already had 2 doses of chemo. I have asked both my local macmillian nurse and the nurse at Christies in Manchester where I'm having the chemo about prognosis, but none will commit and say it is good, just telling me that it depends how my body reacts to the treatment! This has also left me a bit confused as other people I know who have breast cancer have all been told prognosis good!! The headache is a common side effect of the chemo, but I found that after the first week I began to feel alot better. I am on a 3 weekly cycle with the chemo and by the 3rd week felt normal. I started to loose my hair exactly 14 days after the first dose, but this hasn't bothered me. I am just glad that I haven't had any sickness. Be careful what you take for the headache and I hope it eases soon. Best Wishes  ",
