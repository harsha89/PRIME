      "Content": "After having breast cancer twice in the last four years, at my last check up a lump was found in my armpit, biopsy shows a Grade 2, about 1cm.  I'm supposed to be having it removed on the 26th March.  They sent me for a CAT scan and bone scan, CAT scan was fine but bone scan shows a \"doubtful\" verterbrae so now I need an MRI to confirm whether it's just related to the arthritis I have in my spine or a spread from the original cancer.  The thing is, on the letter to my GP she says the removal of the armpit lump will depend on the results of the scans and I'm wondering why? If it's spread, does that mean there's no point in having the lump removed as I'm terminal anyway? I'm getting very anxious about this.  I'd better point out that I've already refused chemo, radiotherapy etc after my previous cancers as I have other health problems that those would affect badly, and if that's what they are going to say for the spine if it is cancer then I'm still saying no.  Has anyone else got bone mets and are still living quite happily despite refusing treatment? Sorry for the long involved post!",

      "Content": "I see an oncologist tomorrow too, to discuss what treatments are necessary following my WLE and ANC  at the beginning of March.  To be honest I'm only going to keep my breast surgeon happy as I've already told her I don't want any treatment other than surgery.  She wants to be sure I know all the facts and figures, which I can appreciate but nothing he can say will make me change my mind.  I had a clear margin on an 8mm tumour but 15 of the 27 lymph nodes she removed did contain cancer cells...still, that means 12 didn't! As already said, write down everything and anything that is in your mind, it's very easy to go blank at the time and remember afterwards, too late!  I hope it all goes well for you. If you haven't already had bone scan and full body CAT scan, do ask for them as a clear result will make you feel much more confident, I know it has me.",

      "Content": "Hi..I had a lumpectomy in March, and axilliary node clearance.  I argued and argued with my surgeon but she insisted I needed a full clearance.  Of 27 nodes removed, 15 had cancer cells in them .  Since the op, I've done all the exercises they show you and have full movement in my shoulder, but I've developed lymphedema which is proving to be a ruddy nuisance! I've been to a clinic and been given compression sleeves, first one kept collapsing at the top, a la Norah Batty's stockings, the next one, a different brand, is so tight it feels as if my circulation is being cut off!   For the past few weeks I haven't worn one at all and my arm doesn't seem to be getting any worse.  I was told by the surgeon that 1 in 4 women develop lymphedema but my BC nurse said more like 1 in 2, and from photos I've seen on Google (don't look!) it can be pretty bad, so that's something to take into account.  Oh..I also had a huge seroma under my arm, they took more than a pint of fluid of it two weeks running.  I think the more you know about these things, the better placed you are to battle it out with your surgeon.  Good luck!",

The lymphedema nurse said the seroma is blocking the path of the lymp so massage it, so I will do lots of aeronautical massage and hopefully it will fly away!",

      "Content": "Thanks everyone for replying..a sort of general answer to various queries.  It's Grade 3 (again) last time it was negative for Herceptin, I'm expecting it to be the same this time. I already have some problems with the shoulder on that side, arthritis in pretty well all my joints, fibromyalgia, and a blood condition that means I take low level chemo tablets every day and will forever, so you probably can see why the prospect of surgery that could cause more pain doesn't exactly sit well.  I'll ask the consultant if I can have just two levels removed and as said, what the comparative risks are.  They did give me a leaflet on Letrazole, but having read that it causes joint and muscle pain, then I'm going to be saying no to that one too.  Hate to think what they put on my notes, awkward ruddy woman probably!",

      "Content": "I was scheduled for surgery on the 13th February, but when in the anaesthetic room and wired up to the ECG thingummy my heart rate was very fast, and in bad atrial fibrillation so they wouldn't carry on, and I ended up in the critical cardiac unit instead, not quite what I'd expected!  Anyway, to cut a long story short, I had the op at last on Monday, and so far so good.  I'm doing the exercises every hour, and apart from some tingling/stabbing feelings in the back of my arm it isn't too bad at all.  They've given me liquid morphine but I'm managing ok with paracetamol.  I see my surgeon next Friday for the results.  I've already told her that I'm not taking Letrozole or anything similar, and no radiotherapy either.  She's said it's my body, my decision and she'll abide by it, although not happily. I hope everyone else who has recently had surgery is doing ok.",

      "Content": "Hi..I'm 70, 71 in May.  Three years ago next month I had a lumpectomy, Stage 3 mixed ductal and micro papillary tumour, removed with clear margins and no node involvement.  Because of other health problems I refused either radiotherapy or hormonal, didn't need chemo.  The oncologist told me that having them would make barely any difference anyway and I had a great chance of no recurrence.  Well...the mammogram I had in November has shown a very small tumour of the same type, same side and one node positive for cancer! The consultant said mastectomy and axillary clearance, but because of my blood problems she felt a reconstruction would fail and break down, so I've said I want another lumpectomy. That doesn't worry me..but the clearance does.  I've read so many horror stories about loss of mobility in the shoulder, permanent pain, swelling not only of the arm but the chest and back etc that I'm now in such a panic I'm thinking of refusing to have anything done at all! Can anyone reassure me please?  The breast clinic nurses are very nice and say it's a rare thing to have a lot of problems, but I've already got three rare conditions and can't help feeling with my luck I'll get them all. ",
