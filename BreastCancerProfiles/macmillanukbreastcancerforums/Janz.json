      "Content": "Hello Jacqueline, I think that it would be good for you to talk with your employers too - knowing a little bit about working with people with multiple and severe disabilties you may have some physical and practical lifting to do so this may affect your return - however your employer might be able to put you on restricted light work for a few weeks to see how things go. Employers do have to make resonable adjustments for you - there are good links around the subject of work on this website that might be helpful to both you and your employer. It is good to be working, time does pass so much quicker, but if you are having some additional treatment you might also wish to talk to your employer about the potential side affects this might have on you - I returned at the beginning of January and some days I think that decision making and the effort of deadlines a bit much (just occasionally, so it is good to prepare them) - I am one third of the way through my chemotherapy after mastectomy and reconstruction. My bosses are just happy that I have returned, though I am not yet even not doing my full role, it still means it is win win with the adjustments. very best wishes",

      "Content": "Hello, after going back and forth to see the breast care nurse for the seroma on my back, after an immediate LD reconstruction, I have just been told that the seroma is the small implant (they boosted my back muscle with) which has moved from my breast to my back. I had the mastectomy on 7th November and noticed that the breast, wasn't what it was at Christmas time - however was reasurred they do settle down. Has anyone had an implant go on walkabout before? - I wonder if all the op fluid and the real seroma which did go down ok sent it swimming to my back where it has beached itself. It is uncomfy and awkward to live with and I'm not sure if it will move again or how to 'care' for it whilst it is on my back. I cannot have an op to rectify this until after my chemotherapy has finished but wasn't given any other advice or support over it - my mind is racing with worries about it. I have lost confidence in the breast care nurse at the hospital - if it had been noticed before I had healed up and started chemo it could have been 'sorted' earlier. Any advice?",

      "Content": "Thank you for responding - I will contact them. I have searched the web and haven't come up with anything similar either. How are you after you 2008 op? - I had hoped to resume some speed walking or a little bit of jogging but am concerned it could move if I do - I don't know what keeps it where it is on my back unless it is the scar from the LD recon? It's all a puzzle - which I am sure can be rectified it's just so disappointing to have to have yet another thing going on at the same time as the chemo etc. Janzxx",
