I totally understand your outlook, and how this helped you make a decision you didn't necessarily want but made for the greater good; putting your family and baby grand-daughter first. Lovely to have a new birth to look forward to! Although new to this process it makes me intensely appreciative of the love of/for family and friends. Best wishes Cx",

I made a \"bid\" in writing to my consultant, enclosing the statement/link you shared with me, not to have the OSNA test and Axillary Node Clearance during my lumpectomy.

      "Content": "Hi Flopsy  I'm learning, as we go through this process, how different the experience and treatment can be for all of us. Also how comforting it is to share individual situations with one another and find some common ground. I had 3 lymph nodes removed during my lumpectomy. I now have one longish scar across the middle of my armpit, with a golf-ball sized swelling underneath it (seroma?). Not painful but a bit uncomfortable, especially at night. We called the nurses on Monday and went into the unit, where they advised best not to drain it, as they usually refill with fluid pdq. I have seen other postings here about seromas, and hoping it will be absorbed naturally, over time. However, I would be interested to hear others views.. Whilst there they removed the dressing on my boob, which I had avoided since the op. Looks OK (better than I'd thought) - slight scarring around the edge of the nipple where they made the incision. Still blue from the dye, but not as bad as the bruising I had after my biopsies, and not really painful. My post-op consultant appt is tomorrow - assuming we will hear the \"pathology\" and treatment plan then.  Still hoping not to have lymph nodes removed, but we shall see... I should think your surgeon will let you know exactly how many lymph nodes you had removed and the reasons for this when you have your appt? But if you are unable to wait, perhaps it might be worth calling them beforehand, for reassurance. On the positive side, you can see/feel your healing, which is good. Amazing what our bodies are able to do, even when they are fighting! Best Wishes",

Your situation does sound very worrying - all we can do is to stay consistent in stating what we want/don't want, I think, and hope the message will get through. I had to resend my email after hearing our consultation today was in a 15 minute slot between nodal scanning and imaging procedures.. Suddenly it has been brought forward to 10am, which suggests the surgeon hadn't seen or read my statement in full. Hoping we don't have to battle the day before surgery.  I actually think your hospital not being able to do the node test puts the brakes on things and allows you time to digest the results and consider options. Good Luck this week. Keep in touch X",

My mum has really suffered from lymphodema since her mastectomy - awful probs with sleeve etc and I really dont want this for myself. I read here that chemo to the armpit is a poss alternative to node clearance. Is this true and are there any others?

Really helpful re research studies - I think others have referenced this too (apologies to you if you have - I'm working my way through the replies, one by one). I'm really uncomfortable with nodal clearance decision happening whilst I'm under, but surgeon implied they wouldn't do the Osna test if I'm not consenting to having nodal clearance at the same time as my lumpectomy. So we guess this may mean removal of sample nodes during the op and waiting for result - and having treatment later. Our ops are very close together - want to keep in touch? ",
