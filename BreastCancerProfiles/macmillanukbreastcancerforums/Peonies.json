      "Content": "Hi, I have been called back to hospital this Thursday for further screening (a tomosynthesis, ultrasound and possible biopsy) following a routine annual mammogram that has shown a 13mm area of density that was not on my mammogram last year. My mum died of BC aged 49, my sister died of BC aged 50. I am a 46, single mum of two beautiful children and scared witless. Since my call back I can feel pain in my breasts which I assume is mainly in my head. All sorts of thoughts going through my head. Any advice to keep positive please. Thanks Xx",

      "Content": "Hi mistymoley  Thank you for your kind message. I can't remember all the details of my mum's and sister's type of cancer. They were both very aggressive but not proved to be linked. My sister did have genetic testing and it was negative for the BRCA gene, but the consultant thinks there is probably a genetic link but one that hasn't been discovered yet. Only one more sleep before my followup tests so that's good. It has made me realise that even if, God willing, the results are good tomorrow that I need to start the process or preventative surgery. Thanks again for the stats and the support. Xxx",
