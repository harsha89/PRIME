      "Content": "Hi Caroline. You must be my 'separated at birth' twin! I was diagnosed with DCIS Aug 2015. A simple WLE became two operations, followed by 15 rads. I've had great care throughout, except since the turn of the year. New year, new me, done and dusted - NOT! No-one told me how low I could be once the treatment finished. And I mean LOW. Things are starting to improve. I contacted my BCC nurse, and was referred to clinical psychology (have had 3 meetings so far). I have a place on a course next month - Moving Forward, and am getting support through McMillan re tea and sympathy, support groups, financial advice and much more. DCIS does indeed equal GUILT. It was NON-invasive = guilt (it's not REAL cancer, I thought to myself!) One operation and it will be gone = guilt (real cancer patients have to have mastectomy ops, chemo, rads etc, I don't) Telling friends and family, and seeing them shocked and pained (before adding \"it's not the bad kind - they can remove it\") = guilt (at their reactions) And it goes on. BUT I'm beginning to come to terms with the fact that yes, it actually was cancer, and the realisation that it has changed me now, and forever more. BUT, good comes from it too. I have been overwhelmed by the love and support of family, friends and work colleagues (ok, and underwhelmed by some), and have new friends, and new understanding. I'm going to work tomorrow, for a meeting with HR. And, if it goes to plan I will both walk in, and out of the meeting with my head held high. I have been on a journey beyond their imagination, and I'm still on that journey but I am determined that, however long it takes, I will come out of this a stronger person. Blimey - sorry for pouring my heart out, that wasn't my intention. Oops, there goes the guilt bit again! Xx",

      "Content": "Hi there. In Aug I had a routine mammogram (my second as I live in an area trialling at 47-73yrs), followed by ultrasound and biopsy. I was diagnose medium grade DCIS - non invasive, 24mm. Great - an operation in 3 weeks and it would be gone! Felt guilty that I had cancer, and not CANCER, if you know what I mean, especially when people reacted as if it were CANCER. I got a much earlier op date due to extra surgeries. (Thinks - is it serious, are they not telling me something? But assured that wasn't the case) Went for results and, actually, it wasn't 24mm, it was 75mm, and the upper margin wasn't clear. Bummer. That wasn't supposed to happen. So, after discussion of options (including Mastectomy, which totally blew my brain!) a second operation planned for early Oct. That went well, with clear results. So, on I go. Due to size etc, I'm booked in for 15 radiotherapy sessions, starting next wednesday. So how come after being strong, brave, positive, I suddenly feel anxious, scared, and very, very low. I think the planning appointment I've just had brought it all home. When I was just about feeling 'normal' following the ops, I have to start again and I know I'm probably in for a bit of a rough ride. The staff at Christies were brilliant, the hospital lovely, but I just don't want to go! I'm sure I'll feel more positive once the treatment starts - it's the means to THE end, after all (hopefully!) I had a meltdown the other night, and felt I had no-one to talk to. I'm sorry for going on - it helps to get it out. Â ",
