      "Content": "Hi, is anyone else experiencing this problem: My first MRI with gadolinium, CT with contrast and chemo round were absolutely fine - no problems.  I don't have a needle phobia or anything like that.  However, along comes round 2.  I found that I experienced a physical reaction to the thought of those drugs going into my body.  Even the thought of the saline drip was making me feel queasy.  For a number of days after treatment, any thoughts of that medication going into my veins or having the cold cap on my head made my stomach turn! Today I had another MRI with gadolinium as well as CT with contrast and I felt the same sick feeling almost to the point of telling them I couldn't do it! Just seem to be developing this psychological revulsion to anything being injected into me.  Am anticipating my treatment plan being changed to weekly chemotherapy on a Thursday and Friday.  How am I going to cope?? It's like a part of me feels it is wrong to be putting this stuff into me.  If I am supposed to overcome cancer, my body should be able to do it, otherwise perhaps it is my time.  I know that is not the way to be looking at things but this feeling that it is wrong is almost overpowering me! If anyone else has felt this and has any tips on how to deal with it, please help! x",

      "Content": "Thanks Carolyn, that's a good idea about the little picnic.  I think distraction is my best bet...I have a portacath so the actual administering of the drugs is not an issue. Epirubicin is the worst as you can see that horrid red liquid trailing through the saline solution as it goes up into the portacath.  Have tried googling my \"phobia\" and nothing seems to come up (lots about needle phobias). Will ask my oncologist when I see him on Wednesday.  Thanks for the good ideas though :) Sara x",

Thanks for your message, it's good to hear from someone who has found a way to manage this aversion.  I will speak to my team to see whether I can get some hypnotherapy.  I am finding the thought of the cold cap particularly distressing even though I don't feel that bothered by it at the time and have had it on for 3 - 4 hours during both the chemo sessions I've had so far!  Really want to continue as I still have my long hair (thinned a fair amount) even though I am on epirubicin and cyclo! Finding out tomorrow what the plan is with my treatment so will know what I am facing then...cold cap on a Thursday and a Friday does not sound fun!!! Sara x",

Perhaps you are right and speaking to someone will help.  I will give it a try I think...anything to help with this as I have to find a way to deal with it!! Sara x",

Saw my oncologist yesterday and he has prescribed some Lorazepam which is a sedative.  Apparently this can help but will mean I won't be able to drive after treatment. Think I am going to try the distraction techniques that you have all suggested first to see if that helps at my next chemo session on Monday.  I have downloaded an audio book to listen to, have an eye mask and will take some lollipops and mints to take the taste away. If unsuccessful, I will take the lorazepam next time round. Thanks to you all for sharing your experience and advice.  It is much appreciated. Blessings and love X",

The shingles I've had the last couple of cycles has come up on my cheek and cleared up quickly with Acyclovir...not had any redness or blisters anywhere else.  Weird but thankfully not unbearable!  Can't wait to start feeling human again in the next day or so.... x",

I am wondering whether it might be shingles as have had bouts of that after the first 2 cycles although just on my cheek and not anywhere else on my torso etc. Going to speak to my oncologist at the next appointment but interested to know if anyone else has the same.

      "Content": "Hi Violet Blue, It sounds like we are in similar positions.  Are you having chemo first?  And do you know whether you are going to be having radiotherapy? I, too, was concerned about fertility and looked into egg preservation.  In the end, I didn't have the time to do it and it is very expensive.  I had some tests to confirm that I have no fertility problems and have been put onto zoladex injections to put my body into chemical induced menopause.  It is believed that this can provide some protection to your ovaries during chemo and my oncologist is optimistic about my chances of being fertile after everything is over. I scar very badly (keloid scarring) so my breast surgeon has recommended an implant as it will have the least amount of scarring. I'm also waiting for genetic testing to come back as, so may face bilateral mastectomy. It is all just such a shock to face this, isn't it?  I am 38 with a 3 year old son (single mum) and have always been very fit and healthy.  I do believe something positive will come out of it.   I'm here if you want to talk or want any info on what I've already had.  Sara x",

      "Content": "Hi Kerry, Unfortunately I wasn't given much of a choice because of the size of my tumour and the type of cancer (ER+ HER2+).  I have had to start chemo, will then have surgery and will follow with radiotherapy...the whole bang shoot! I was diagnosed last November so have had 3 rounds of chemo so far.  The first week after treatment is tough but then I start feeling human again and have at least 1 good week generally.  One more of these and then I am onto 12 weeks of weekly chemo with different drugs so it will be a whole new ball game. I do hope you don't have to go through chemo and that surgery will be the answer...but if you do, we are all here to support you. I went to a fertility clinic and was offered either IVF (which takes about a month or so) or they can stimulate your ovaries to produce more eggs subject to certain conditions.  The eggs would then be frozen.  I also had an ultrasound and a blood test to check fertility and to see whether I was at an appropriate point in my cycle. Speaking to my oncologist, I really didn't have time to do a full round of IVF so the only choice would be the stimulation.  I could have done it and the fertility clinic were great trying to get appointments booked as there was so little time but in the end I decided against it.  The success rate is very low (about 30%), it is very expensive and it felt like it was such a rush with everything going on.  The results of the ultrasound and blood test showed I have very good fertility and my oncologist felt that because of my young age, there is a good chance that I will regain my fertility when I've finished.  I am not in a relationship either but, like you, didn't want to rule anything out and have regrets later. You have more time since you are having surgery first so my advice to you is to explore your options.  At least get it straight in your head that you have made an informed decision so that you don't have any regrets later.  As you and I know all too well, you never know what is round the corner!!! Good luck lovely, the right thing will come to you. Hugs, Sara xxx",
