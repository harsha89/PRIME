One day I was gardening and I heard a \"plop\" and there on the earth, nestling among the weeds, was my false boob- .I made a note to be careful where I wore them in future ( mind you, it was a very old saggy bra!). I'm going to a swimming group for cancer patients for the first time tomorrow and shall go boobless, as I was told if you don't have a proper swimsuit with a pocket, the prosthesis can float away! Now that WOULD be embarrassing!",
