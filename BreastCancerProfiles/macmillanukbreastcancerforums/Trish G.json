      "Content": "Hi Tracey, You've got a lot to deal with at the moment. I was diagnosed last month and offered a skin sparing mastectomy with delayed immediate reconstruction. Don't know if that would be something you Could consider? Good luck, trust your doctors but value your own judgement too. I opted for a straightforward mastectomy,based on the fact i am a wimp and hate being a patient but it was a good call 'cos my tumour was larger than on ultrasound too so now I have to have radiotherapy. Imust admit since diagnosis I've just wanted to be with my family as much as possible, so it must be tough being so far away from home. take care and best wishes",

Ihave been given extra steroids and Tramadol so fingers crossed. My haemoglobin finally dropped too low so I had 2 units of blood today, and I had an infection which needed antibiotics. Ive been dreading the final 2 doses so this has cheered me up. You must be really pleased to get through chemo. Good luck. Trish",

I am half dog half eagle. Not a pretty sight but I do try, and I have started wearing eyeshadow again, drawing those eyebrows back on. The only problem is I use liquid eyeliner and because no eyelashes I sometimes end up painting it on my eyeball ( honestly the things we do) when the brush slips. I'll watch out for big birds- they probably see a giant chick and want to feed me worms. The chemo made me menopausal( definitely keeping men on pause) so I suppose I just have to wait and see if its permanent- I'm 44 so possibly not. The hot flushes and night sweats are shocking. I know youve got the last side effects to get through, but enjoy being over the chemo, hope the nice weather continues, so you can ignore the housework and get out and about and sit amongst the daffodils. Take care, Trishxxx",

After my reaction to the first tax, the chemo nurse suggested I had my dose reduced and like you I was worried about reducing effectiveness. My oncologist has kept the doses the same. Ive just had a look through some of the posts and there seems to be an agreement that it can be tailored to your height/weight (Tax comes pre-packed in a one size fits all bag and you just get the whole lot) without reducing its effectiveness. This is such a worrying time, and feeling so rotten makes it hard if not impossible to make really important decisions logically when youre on such an emotional rollercoaster.Have you spoken to BCN? Keep in touch and take care. (((()))))Trish xx",

Funny thing happened after my last post , got neutropenic sepsis again and ended up in hospital for 5 days on IV antibiotics. I felt lousy cos my son had given me a nasty cold, and when I shuffled to the chemo unit to say I was going home i must have looked pretty bedraggled so when I went for the last dose they said I was having a dose reduction of 25%. I'm quite relieved and am waiting to see how I feel when the steroids rub off. I did feel really peculiar, because straight away I wondered if the dose reduction meant reduced effectiveness, but really think that the 5 previous doses must have had some effect. I can't believe The monster cells enjoyed FEC-T any more than my poor healthy ones. How are you getting on? Trish",

It is completely grey and all pointing directly upwards, also my parting has swapped sides. i look like a little eagle chick. I am dog tired, worse than any of the other times, but that may also be because I'm trying to get back to normality and doing a bit more - all the lovely sunshine is blazing through the windows highlighting all the ingrained filth that has accumulated since i gave up housework last September. Ive got my sense of taste back as well so thats good. Went for CT scan in preparation for rads and I got my tattoos done. Theyre tiny- I didnt know what to expect , sort of a big arrow pointing to where my boob had been saying' fry here' but its just 4 tiny dots that look like freckles. Treatments start on the 10th April. When do you kick off? Good luck with it all, hope it goes well. I start Tamoxifen at the same time so I literally am counting down the days to the end of the 'big' treatments. Doesn't everything seem better in the sunshine ?

Sad about corned beef mits though. My hands haven't been affected yet apart from the nail beds are very dusky and dark. I think my nails may go, well whatever's left of them cos Ive  chewed them right down to stumps. They look dreadful. That's an amazing amount of money for one injection when you think about it. I didn't read the label too carefully I just stuck it in. took extra steroids and tramadol for 5 days after the previous tax which left me feeling wrecked but pain free. i was told to inject the pegfilgrastim 24 hours after the chemo which i did religiously. I wonder if it would have made a difference leaving it til later? Well, it doesn't matter now, just got to get through this weekend, My daughter's last Mother's Day at her First school and I'm going if they have to push me in a wheelbarrow Have a great weekend, and here's hoping a S/E free one.(  ) Trish",

      "Content": "Hi Flower,  I had the same experience as you, I had been told I had a large area of DCIS with some invasive ductal carcinoma, after the Mastectomy I found I had 2 tumours, one 60mm and one12mm. The node biopsy came back positive 2 out of 3. I have now had an axillary clearance- no further nodes involved- and 5 of my 6 chemotherapy cycles. I have to have radiotherapy after chemo complete. The histology report was like a punch in the guts. I couldn't believe how different from the initial diagnosis it could be,I realised that harsh as it seemed, the goalposts had been shifted right across the park and I really had to face up to a much harder battle against this thing.  I hit rock bottom when they arranged for CT and Bone Scans, because I imagined it would have spread everywhere,  and I would have had more bad news to cope with. I cried and begged God or Buddha or angels or Ganesh or whoever was listening to give me more time with my kids. Half an hour before I went to theatre for the node clearance I was told both scans were clear. And after that, The fight back started. Ive struggled through the chemo- needed a Hickman line, been admitted to hospital twice with neutropenic sepsis, suffered agonising pain with docetaxel- and i'm not looking forward to the radiotherapy- 80 mile round trip. I'm tired and half mad most of the time but my strength comes from wanting to be with my family for a long time. You will find your strength too, and it will come suddenly when you realise what youve been through and survived, recovered from surgery, got through chemo,  heard the terrifying words of surgeons, when what they say is about you, some days making the tea has to be your fantastic achievement of the day, other days you'll feel you can take on anything or anyone. I wish you luck, and stay on the site. Reading others' posts and experiences has really helped when you feel youre going it alone. We're on this rollercoaster of crap. Your life has been turned upside down, but you're among friends, wishing you a good recovery from your next surgery, and good luck with your treatment. You'll find that strength, and you can do whatever you have to, be safe and go well, Trish    ",

      "Content": "Hi Wendy, thinking of you! Good luck for Friday!! I'm having the usual fun after taxotere, with added abdominal distention just for fun.( I look pregnant with quads) I had bruising after my core biopsy. the radiologist did a really good local anaesthetic, so the core biopsy just felt like a bit of shoving, and the fine needle biopsy of the lymph nodes was the same, but 2 or 3 days after I came out black and blue and quite sore, and the bruises weren't where I'd expected them- ie where the needle things went in. The lump then got sore, and so did my arm down as far as the elbow. Ive just been reading a cracking good thread about what to take into hospital with you. Some excellent ideas. Good that youve got your nighties sorted out. V. important to have comfortable nighties. My main problem was the noise at night, cos the wards were always quite busy and bright, so I found the i-pod very helpful,with a good book downloaded onto it. i took lots of books for during the day, but when you want to go to sleep you need a nice boring story read with a droning voice! Just take care of yourself. Also Snacks! In the hospital i was in, you get your tea at 5pm and then nothing til breakfast at 8 the next morning.Shocking. I'm a night time nibbler so I had to get supplies in. They'll probably give you regular painkillers, and youll want something on your stomach. Rads start on the 11th of April. 15 sessions. Shriek! Its really good to be able to count the weeks til the end of the big treatments, but Ive got the scan first, so fingers crossed it'll be good news. You'll be great, make sure y0u rest and take good care of yourself Best best best luck and hugs ((( ))) Trish x",

      "Content": "Hi Wendy, Its horrible waiting isn't it? I'm ok after the surgery thanks, and its really strange but the thought of having a big fat elephant arm has upset me more than losing a breast, chemotherapy, losing hair and eyelashes. i had the mastectomy first- I was offered immediate reconstruction but chose not to have it and woke up with a nice neat scar which extended about 3 cms under the arm. I had an infusion pump with local anaesthetic into the wound for 3 days post op and never felt a thing. I went home with suction drains in and the district nurses came and measured the gloop every day. When they went back for the axillary nodes, they went through the same scar, and I had IV morphine and it was quite sore.I felt a lot of pain in my shoulder. I was a lazy troll and didnt do my exercises as often as I should so I got cording which took about 2 weeks  with massage and stretching to get rid of. I'm really fastidious about the exercises now.I went home the next day  with 2 vacuum drains again, which oozed away for a week before removed. I think I lost a lot of blood with the 2 procedures and the drain - which is something to think about if you do end up having chemo- if your Hb drops below 10 you may have to have a blood transfusion.( if youre a meat eater get some steak and mince- spinach didn't cut it for me) I didn't know I needed radiotherapy til after I got the histology results. If I'd had the implant, they said it would just need deflating and wouldn't be a problem. My arm was numb to the elbow, and round the wound was patchy (feeling not appearance). Sensation has started to come back, but as I'm still numb from a cesarian section 10 years ago I'm not sure how much will return. Watch out for the cording, its nasty. After the drains were removed my arm seemed to get puffy, and i did worry about lymphoedema. Nicola my BCN showed me how to massage the arm, and in the evening I used to sit with my arm raised on cushions - above heart level- for the fluid to drain away. I also use Kinesio (?) tape to stop the scar getting tethered and to help lymph drainage. Make sure you have some nice strong pain killers to hand - you might not need them, but its good to know theyre there. Really really wishing you good luck for the op. try and have a bit of a rest if you can before they chuck you out. I got a nice planner from the physios telling me what I should and should not be doing in terms of housework- first fortnight NOTHING next week make a cup of tea sort of thing. Presented to husband with instructions to crack on with the washing etc. Wishing you well, fingers crossed that you wont need chemo/rads and the other nasties. Do you know if you'll need herceptin or tamoxifen yet? Good luck and very best wishes (don't know if any of that helps but here's a hug (( )). It'll be ok.) Trish",

I was a wee bit emotional which surprised me cos I was well prepared and thought I was Ok . I had several large glasses of bubbly and felt a lot calmer (followed by happy giggly, silly and finally sick) I have been wandering round without my hat on in the house, but I'm still getting used to the draughts round my neck and ears! Do you have a nice wig? I've just bought a load of neck warmers from the Mountain Warehouse and they feel ok. My scalp is a bit irritable so some of the scarves and hats I bought feel really itchy. My daughter was sick last week- she was supposed to be Mary in the nativity play and she missed the evening performance. I felt awful not being able to give her a cuddle, but like you priority one is staying out of hospital in this festive season. My second chemo is on Wednesday so I'll be back on the Neutropenia Lottery again. I hope father Christmas and his elves bring you lots of neutrophils. Take good care of yourself. I'm on the lookout for some pretty temporary tatoos to stick on, youre right- the wide open space on my head is just begging for noughts and crosses or some sort of advertising? Trishx",

      "Content": "Hello lesleym44, I'm so sorry to hear you've lost your good friend and you must feel pretty raw at this time. I'm glad you're fighting hard and we will get through it. Sometimes it seems as though fate waits until we are at the limit of endurance before dealing out another slap. I'm not having Herceptin but I've had my third cycle of FEC and am suffering with hot flushes and night sweats. The nights are miserable with me burning up, shoving the covers off, freezing, dragging up the covers, boiling,,etc. the lack of sleep is making me slightly mad.I've been trying to find some solutions , and have read that for symptoms of menopause, so far:- Black Cohosh, lots of Soya,sage tincture, chasteberry, avoid alcohol,coffee, hot drinks,and spicy food, Try vitamin E and best of all, a tepid bath for 20 minutes every morning. I don't know if any/all of them are ok with your Herceptin. I've started drinking soya milk and having soya yoghurt but I seem to cancel that benefit by eating curry twice a day - I love Thai green curry and its one of the few things that taste normal to me. I'm going to try the black cohosh next and work my way through them til I find something that works. Good luck with the rest of the herceptin. You need some sad time, to grieve for a friend, but keep climbing the hill. Best wishes, Trish",
