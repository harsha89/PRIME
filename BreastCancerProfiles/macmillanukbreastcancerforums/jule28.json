    "Content": "Hi everyone, Just looking for a little advice - again - so who better to ask than the lovely people on here who always give their best advice. My mum goes into hospital on surgery for a quadrantectomy. I just wondered if anyone could advise what she will need after her surgery - any little things that may make life easier for her. I think it is always best to ask people who have been through this themselves. This site has helped me so much so far. Thank you x",
