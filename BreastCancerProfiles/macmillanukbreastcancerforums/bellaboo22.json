I am not sure now whether to try them or not. I believe it is a 3% reduction of recurrence but with bad side effects. I would welcome any opinions please",

I just wondered if it could happen out of the blue or is it always associated with extractions - which it seems to be. Thank you so much for your reply. Hope you stay well. Love Dee xx",

Same with the biphosphonates - I suggested it to her and she agreed - think she must be tired of me reading things ! My lobular was found when i noticed dimpling but no lump was ever felt - it is a sly bugger !! Take care Love Dee",

      "Content": "Hi Chockie I was diagnosed with invasive lobular breast cancer almost 2 years ago and I still see my oncologist every 3 months for a chat and a check up. I also have yearly MRI on my remaining breast as my lobular was not picked up on a mammogram. I am not sure of the chance of recurrence but will ask next time I see her. I take a daily aspirin,letrozole and have just started 6 monthly infusions of biphospanates all to try and keep this evil disease at bay. It sounds like you have been let down by your team and would recommend ringing BCN and organising a check up and get back into the system. Good luck and hope you keep well",

My query is oncologist said she will see me every 3 months but no scans of any sort planned ( apart from yearly mammograms and MRI scans ) so how will she know if it has spread by just asking me how I feel ? Thank you for any replies as feeling bit lost and confused. Dee",
