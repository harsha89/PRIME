      "Content": "Hi Muldoon glad you\u2019re through your treatment. You don\u2019t mention Herceptin, the treatment for HER2+. Did you manage to get that without chemo? I kind of thought they came together. You should probably discuss whether you should be having that, even now. It\u2019s a jab in the thigh every 3 weeks. Most don\u2019t notice too many side effects, although it\u2019s a bit cumulative & you feel more tired towards the end of the year of treatment.  You don\u2019t lose your hair, although mine grew more slowly during treatment, and it shouldn\u2019t affect your lungs. If you really didn\u2019t  want chemo, have you done a lot of complimentary things to compensate like green juices, meditation, detox & dietary changes?i would think they might be helpful in your position & a lot of people swear by them. Hope you start feeling like your old self soon, if you aren\u2019t already xx",

I just breathed a huge sigh of relief when I woke up from the op & thought \u2018its gone\u2019. I found relaxation apps were good to stop your mind running riot (Glenn Harold is good about £3 on the App Store). Also read about what you can do to help your chances eg diet,exercise etc as it gives you some control back over your life. Going through cancer treatment is odd, you can\u2019t quite believe it\u2019s happened to you & it\u2019s simultaneously normal & totally abnormalat the same time. You will be amazed how much support you get from friends (virtual & real).i found email exchanges from people who had been through it really helpful in the first few days. Do you know anyone that\u2019s had it or a friend of a friend? Good luck with your next appt. the first few weeks are a real whirlwind & it\u2019s hard to sleep, hence the relaxation apps.

[Edited by Admin] There is also some info on some of the other posts about what you can do to reducing your chances of getting depression.  The main thing to remember is that it takes time to recover. I thought I was better 3 months after treatment finished, but a year later I realised I was still improving. If you\u2019ve had chemo you\u2019ve probably forgotten what \u2018normal\u2019 feels like.  You do think about it quite a lot to start with but gradually it fades into the past & life takes over. It all seems like a (not so great) dream now (I am a year post treatment). The only time it plays on my mind now is the week before annual mammo.  I am still visit this blog from time to time because I review leaflets for Macmillan.

      "Content": "Panagram sorry to hear your story.  The stress of dealing with your horrible neighbours probably contributed to getting the BC.  Most people have some major stress in the 1-2 years before diagnosis.  My dad died for example.  We are really pressurised to take these hormonal treatments, but you need to know what your risk is to properly weigh up the risk/benefits. If you had a small low grade BC with no nodal spread then your chances of getting to 10 years would be very high. Even if the % reduction in recurrence is quite high, it may only amount to a small difference in the real world & you may decide the effect on your body is not worth it.  I just want quality of life & couldn\u2019t stand the side effects so stopped.  Yes, might well not be the sensible thing to do, but I do feel like a human being again & i\u2019m enjoying my life again.  I do a lot of natural things to block the ER receptors instead.  I\u2019m not telling you to stop, but just make sure you have the right info to make your decision.  In my case tamoxifen allegedly made 30% difference, but that was only 1 less person in 100.  I traded that for my life back.

Honestly people who say \u2018breast cancer is a good one to get\u2019 have no idea how stressful the reality of it all is. Just a quick thought. Make sure they do an Oncotype DX if they\u2019re recommending chemo. Lots of people don\u2019t need chemo after that test & it is available on the NHS. Chemo is doable but very damaging to your body, so if it\u2019s not completely essential good to avoid. All the best.

It knocked me right back & I think I felt worse than I did when I first got diagnosed. They details of the tumour often change when you get the results back, it's not them being incompetent, it's just some tumours aren't visible on mammogram. Re cold cap. The chemo drugs are very harsh & the cold cap is not guaranteed to work BUT there were 4 of us using it when I went through chemo.  3 lost hair, but still looked perfectly normal. I think I lost 50% of my hair, but was never bald. DEFINITELY worth a try.  It also grows back a lot faster & more controllable after chemo finishes if you cold cap. [Edited by Admin]. I don't believe there is a tablet to save your hair.  It's the absolute worst part of it all in my view. I would think it might well change the stage, but it's only one factor they use to decide your treatment, so please try not to get too upset. Big hug & sorry you're having such a tough time. Have you asked them about freezing some eggs?  They should be able to advise you about that.  There is a young women's breast cancer network if you want to talk to some others your age.  You will be mainly fine to look after your son, so don't worry.  Chemo is vile, but it's kinda better than you expect in a weird way.

Provided it is ultra-low dose, research shows no increase in systemic oestrogen levels hence being safe for ER+ BC. I used it every day for two weeks & everything returned to pre-BC condition (without going into too much detail ha ha). My doc also showed me a diagram which shows that estriol does not metabolise to dangerous BC causing compounds, unlike oestrodiol & estrone. It all looked a little complicated, but I got the point. Now just use if there is any discomfort. So nice for normal service to be resumed. I work in a GP surgery & they won\u2019t give any form of oestrogen to pts with a history of BC, so don\u2019t be surprised if GP hasn\u2019t heard of it. I went into mine with the research showing it was safe, plonked myself down, burst into tears & said sex life so uncomfortable it was making me miserable.  She read it & then said ok. xxxx ps my dose is 0.03 of oestriol. Apparently you also have testosterone receptors \u2018down there\u2019 so that also helps if you\u2019re not willing to try oestriol.",

Obviously doing anything other than the standard dose has to be balanced against the risk of recurrence. Each one of us has to make up our own mind what\u2019s right for us.

If your hospital doesn\u2019t give you numbing cream to use before they access it, Emla cream from boots works just as well. Although having the port put in is an additional op, it\u2019s a bonus once you have it as the chemo all goes into a large vein where the blood\u2019s moving fast & you don\u2019t get damaged arm veins. It doesn\u2019t need dressing & you can do sport or whatever activities you want to. One odd thing is that they want to keep it in for a year. I wanted to get rid of mine as soon as chemo was finished, but had to push for that to happen. I was trying to move forward with my life & there is, of course, a risk of clots with any central line.
