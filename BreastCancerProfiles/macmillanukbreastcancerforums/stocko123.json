      "Content": "Blue67 Hi, I have had breast cancer in both breasts, so I've had lymph nodes removed on both sides. The second time was last year and I was told by my consultant that I musn't have injections in either arm. I've had several blood tests taken from my foot in the last year. This had been done while I've been in hospital for one reason or another. I need to have a routine blood test and none of the phlebotomists at my local hospitals ( I've tried 3) will do it. Two hospitals said 'we don't do feet' and the third said 'we're not insured to do feet'. There must be other ladies out there who can't have bloods taken from either arm. How do they get on? Any advice.",

It came back negative  but due to me having the test they are keeping  a close eye on my daughter  who was 35 at the time. They go through all your family history  they let me have the test as I was high risk due to having breast cancer twice 12 years apart and also my aunt had cervical  cance. I was frightened  to have the test but I know that  my daughter  is know being checked every year ",
