    "Content": "Hi 4Paws, My sister has her last chemo session today for stage 3 BC. I am praying that it has shrunk the tumor and we can just get on with cutting the damn thing out. She got diagnosed last year December 30th, and at the time was on maternity leave and was breast feeding. So it was a little stressful for everyone. But the village aka family rallied round. I am so sorry you were along during your treatment. I have watched my sister's mental state breakdown whilst trying to care for her two babies 9month and the time and the other is 4. Her husband did as much as he could but i think it hit him more than it did her.  I agree with you in your comment that the worst part is over. Apart from her family and life and other stuff i just want her to know she has multiple reasons to fight. Sometimes the depression takes over and it's hard to get her out of it.  We were thinking work would be a good reason to kind of 'buck up' and get on with it as we say  \"you've got many years ahead you\". Would you say just carrying on worked?  Zizi x",
