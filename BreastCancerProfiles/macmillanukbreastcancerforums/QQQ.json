      "Content": "I've been stage 4 since I was diagnosed, in 2012. So yes, I've been around the block, but many ohers have more track record than I do. The main thing is to be as informed as possible about your own case. Forums can be really helpful for comparing symptoms, but there's no substitute for Googling around for info about one's own medications, including their side effects and what can be done about them. Just stick to the responsible sources. Cancer.gov is a good one, and drugs.com is good on symptoms (scroll down to the \"For Professionals\" section. Otherwise, I stick to the Mayo Clinic site and other professional sites. The British have some good info on the NIH sites but that's if you're ready to read the more technical stuff. Just be careful. If you just Google for anything you can get really confused as different sites promote berries or yoga or sesame seeds, etc. I'm not saying these don't help but in most cases there's just not any solid info that they do.Â  What matters most is your cancer chemistry. So you do need to know if you're ER+ (estrogen positive) or PR+ (progesterone positive) or HER2+. Do you have this info? Literature on cancer that doesn't fit your own cancer's chemistry can be worthless to you.",

      "Content": "It's pretty tough to want to go back to \"normal\" and find it's not happening. All too many women face this after surgery. All my sympathies! Anastrozole and Letrozole can have pretty bad side effects of joint pain, muscle pain, etc. For me, that includes terrible fibromyalgia. Makes some of us feel like we're a hundred years old. Some women can't handle the pain and the loss of quality of life and go off the Anastrozole in an effort to get their lives back - BAD IDEA, though, as these drugs deprive any surviving cancer cells of the estrogen they feed on and so are pretty essential in consolidating your recovery. But you can certainly require that your oncologist/s take your pain seriously and give you something for it. I'm afraid the most effective pain meds for me were opioids, much denounced these days for their addictive qualities, but I've had no problem with dependency and they've made a big difference in my quality of life. I take them only when I really need them: MS Contin and Oxycodone. On the osteoporosis, it also can be aggravated by cancer drugs. You might ask your onc about taking a bisphosphonate, such as denosumab (Xgeva) or zoledronic acid (Zometa), which changes the bone chemistry and slows this down. It's fairly common for bisphosphonates to be part of one's medical regime after surgery when on long-term drug therapy, at least for a while. Xgeva is given as an injection every four weeks; Zometa is given as an IV over a longer gap period.",
