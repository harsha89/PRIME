      "Content": "Hi everyone, I'm a little stressed with all this waiting about at the min.  I am 29yrs old and from finding the lump on December 9th it took 11weeks of waiting about for appointments and finally got diagnosed on the 24th February.  I had an MRI on the 8th March and I know I have invasive stage 2 estrogen POS breast cancer. I have an appointment on 16th March to discuss surgery and treatment plan but I'm worried after this meeting I will have yet more waiting to do. Can anyone tell me how long I should expect to wait? Each long emotional day feel like a week and I can't help but worry my lump is getting bigger and everything I have read outlines the importance of treating it at the earliest stage. Thank you in advance ",

      "Content": "Hello everyone I am just after a bit of advice. I am a 29 year old mother of two recently diagnosed with stage 2 invasive breast cancer.  following a MRI scan i was found to also have a second tumor which has been confirmed cancer too.  I am still awaiting my biopsy results on my swollen lymph nodes.  I have been told I must have a mastectomy now and the lumpectomy is no longer an option.  I am wondering if anyone has had a bilateral mastectomy by choice as a preventative measure?  I am seriously thinking of asking for this with reconstruction later.  ",
