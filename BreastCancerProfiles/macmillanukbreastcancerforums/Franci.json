    "Content": "Hi  I'm new to this forum. I finished my Fec-T 100 chemo 10 days ago . So glad but also feel shattered emotionally and physically. Right now I can't feel positive . Monday have radio planning , then soon after will start 5 weeks of radio to left  breast and collarbone . Went to open evening the radio nurses and  radiographers were very good, they reassured me but I'm still a bit scared of starting another treatment and it's side affects. Would love to hear some encouragement from others please who have been through same. Cheers ",
