      "Content": "Hi  My hair started falling out after my second cycle of FEC so my husband clipped it to number 3, then a week later to 0.. Last week end he shaved it all off as it was like sleeping on a hair brush at night. I am not so brave as to answer the door without a scarf or hat on yet.  I didnt go in for a wig at all as one of my fears is it blowing off while out and about.  A hat coming off doesnt seem so bad strangely. I also used Annabandana but found that that the bandanas rubbed my ears and back of the neck where the elastic was a bit stiff so mostly use hats now. I have loved reading all your comments and hope that mine will be useful for anyone else out there Brenda",

      "Content": "Hi there saw my new consultant at my local hospital on Thursday  What a lovely lady.  Went through everything with her.  The side effects from the first Docetaxol were classic  has prescribed more steroids for a few extra days and also upped the pain killers.  My lump is hormone receptive so will be on hormone therapy for 5 years after radiotherapy.  hormone may affect bone density so will also be on vit d and calcium tablets.  Examined breast and had difficulty finding a 2cm lump. There was a slight thickening but not much else.  This will hopefully mean a smaller op but there are lymph nodes to be removed and also glands under the collar bone.  I am to see surgeon on 6th July and surgery should take place hopefully 4 weeks after last cycle which is on 8th July.  all in all a positive appointment. Now just waiting for side effects to kick in tomorrow.  Only one more cycle to go tho All the best to everyone on here  Will be back",
