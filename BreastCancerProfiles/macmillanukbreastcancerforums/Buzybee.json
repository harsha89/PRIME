    "Content": "Hiya, this is just awful for you Are you in the position to pay for a private mammogram?! I know it\u2019s crazy to even have to think about this as an option but for your own peace of mind and sanity.  I went to my GP with a weird sensation in my nipple that\u2019s been present for around 7/8wks. She examined me and found a lump and I got a urgent cancer referral. Appt next Tuesday (15/5/18) oddly I can\u2019t actually feel any lump, my boobs actually feel like a bag of peas TBH, very lumpy. I\u2019m grateful the dr is being cautious but boy my head is going overtime to the point I can\u2019t sleep and I\u2019m googling like it\u2019s going out of fashion Really hope you\u2019re seen asap. Sending positive thoughts and hugs your way xxxxxx ",
