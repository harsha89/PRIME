    "Content": "Hi, I looked on this website purely out of curiosity, im still not completely sold on the idea of forums & I have a very dim view of social media, if I go for a coffee or meal I want to enjoy it with my friends not take pictures to show the world whilst it goes cold!! I'm a doer not a talker or a thinker I believe but I do understand that these things can be a support to people. I have laughed, cried, agreed & disagreed whilst I have been reading posts & have suprised myself at my taking part!! I also think that my curiosity came from the fact that I know no one with cancer & have never really had any contact with anyone going through the 'experience'  I am one extremely lucky girl, my friends immediately stopped saying 'you' or 'i' & started saying 'we'. When I had side effects from chemo even slight ones the response was 'So what do we do about this?' I received goody bags from friends & family that contained all the little things that make me smile to be enjoyed, lip balms, body creams, new jamas, snuggly blankets, candles, when my hair started to come away my friend went into town to buy me silk bandanas, another got on the Internet to source headwear for me, just taking away those stresses for me was utterly priceless. I am welcomed into family units at a moments notice (I spend a lot of time alone as I'm not allowed to work grrrrrrr) so find myself feeling like a caged animal at times, cabin fever is horrendous! Yet I know that since the minute this started I have 3 homes to go to for a while for a dose of normality!! Kids screaming, mens banter, dinner cooking, bad days at work are perfect to be around, I don't think they know how much their support...all of their support, kids & husbands included means to me & will do for the rest of my life.  There are those that seem to allocate time to me & I accept this as just being their way but in hindsight I will not ask them for a minute in the future, having only asked once feeling that after a lifetimes friendship this would be ok & those that as many have said before is more about their feelings & me making them feel better!! Erm hello get over yourself love!  I have had support from unlikely places which is lovely & those that promise the earth & deliver nothing! But that's life & they aren't worth bothering with, I am honestly happier now as I feel settled & secure with those around me, so so far this has been a positive experience for me.  I am happy to be contacted further. Thank you & best wishes to those having a little surf & reading this! It will get better  ",
