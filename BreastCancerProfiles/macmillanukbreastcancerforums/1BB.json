I will need to have at least a couple more.  The good news is that my stomach hasn't been this flat since the eighties and it was a relatively quick recovery.  The bad news is that I still don't really look like a woman with a pair of boobs. This will be different for you if it's just modelling rather than building. My stomach hurt for a few weeks afterwards but nothing I couldn't manage without paracetamol. Good luck",

Wonderful chemo nurses all descended on me and felt fine within about 5/10 mins but still very scary. Heard that it's not that uncommon. Meeting Onco next week and hoping to start a new drug but not sure how many/ when I can start it etc. Just when you think the end is in sight....",

That is how my onco has described herceptin.  I'm through chemo and halfway through herceptin. Ten years of tamoxifen. That worried me because I'd heard that some people couldn't do because couldn't stand the side effects but I'm finding it fine.  Getting my life back and you will too. x",
