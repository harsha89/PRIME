I do have such a lot of great friends around me that all want to help but I have always been an independent person who would never ask for help so it adds to my anxiety about the situation.  chemo will probably start the beginning of sept so joining that group would be good. I cannot lie I am still trying to work out how this all works not that best at computer type stuff. i am really scared of the chemo side and everyone just goes on about having a positive mind and of course they are right but it all just freaks me out.  i feel so drained already that's before I have even started the chemo. xx",

I left yesterday's session with a huge wait lifted as I think everyone around you tries to hard to say postive things you end up feeling that your feelings are wrong. I am defiantly going for more and reckon when I finish with the therapist she will need counselling after listening to me go on...  Everybody has their own opinions and it's hard for our husbands too but I realise cancer consumes the person who has it we don't get a break from it everyone else around us does..   Good luck with your next stage  Eleanor x",

      "Content": "Hi giglingertie I was a grade 3 triple negative had a lumpectomy 27th of June 2015 and 2 sentinol nodes removed to which 1 contained high levels of cancer cells. I was offered the clinical trial to keep remaining lymph nodes and have extra radio therapy to them but I choose to have them all removed as I wanted to take every precaution I can to prevent my cancer returning. None of the 26 nodes removed did contain cancer cells but I still feel it could have gone the other way and I didn't want to take any chances. I had my 6 cycles of chemo then went on to have 20 sessions of radiotherapy.  At this present moment in time I don't really have any major issues with my arm at all. It all feels a bit tight but I can pretty much use it the same as before it is maybe a bit weaker but then that's how I feel generally at the moment any way. I know other people are left with problems and I could be on here at any time asking advise because I have ended up with fluid or problems but I still know that I did it for the right reasons and for me it was another step to making sure I'm cancer free.

      "Content": "It would be great to support each other. I have a son who is 8 and amazing. My daughter who has Aspergers and ADHD is 11 and my eldest is 16 in sept and confused to why we are not having a house party for her birthday this year. i am really worried about my daughter going to secondry school as I had to committed to taking her there as our local secrondry school is not very good so she is traveling to the same school my eldest got a maths scholarship into so she was able to go but I don't feel she is able to travel on the school buses that operate. i am dreading the chemo as the girls are both such hard work at the best of times. My 16 year old daughter is extremely lazy and selfish so she offers little help and does not try and get along with her sister.  I am a planner but my husband is a wait and see what happens person. xxx  ",

      "Content": "Hi I had full axillary clearance on the 31st of July and it still all feels very tender and sore. I drove today for the first time and it Was very uncomfortable and now feels quite painful. I also feel at times if I try and go out for longer periods of time quite faint and unwell. It was my second op as had a wle on June 27th. I am due to start my chemo soon and don't realily want them to delay it but not sure if I should mention it to them when I have  my next appointment. i also am not sure wether to persevere with the driving as my children are going back to school tomorrow and I need to drive them there but worried I might do more damage. think my husband is keen for me to drive also although it hasn't been to much of a problem for him, eleanor",

      "Content": "Hi Karen.. I drove again today and it still hurts but going to persevere as I don't want my middle daughter having to get on the school bus.. Olivia has been very agitated and actually a complete nightmare but all went ok this morning but I think that was because her dad was about he normally has to leave very early but as it was her first day at secrondry school he organised things so he could work local. i got my chemo start date today it's going to be the 16th....... Thank you crystaljuju very helpful.. I have to go on the 14th for my pre chemo chat so at least I know what to expect now. I am having fec-t.. Got 2 weeks now to get organised and hopefully fit a few things in... I have planned to get some scarves I am not sure about the wig thing at the moment.... But I might feel different later on.. I am a hairdresser and just can't face the thought of going wig shopping. My daughter has offered to lend me her dress up wigs but think they may not suit me.  How did you go today Karen?",

      "Content": "Hi chloecat45 thank you for your help it's not really the seat belt that is a problem it's changing gear and turning the sterling wheel. i have been able to do most things for a while some things pull a bit like pegging out washing but as you say maybe after a few times it might get better.  There is no swelling or hotness around the scar actually it has healed well just feels so raw and tendor all around the area and around my back. I suppose it's to be expected really isn't it.. I do just want to get on with my chemo now I was hoping to hear as I have had the first appointment and agreed to it etc. I am fine doing house stuff and walking the dog but if we go out maybe to the shops or anything to much I just feel faint after a while and I got worried today as I keep getting an aching pain at the side of my head and my vison is blurry at times. I suppose it could be blood pressure it's been a bit stressful with my middle daughter she has Aspergers and ADHD so is very full on. well thank you for all your help  xxx  ",
