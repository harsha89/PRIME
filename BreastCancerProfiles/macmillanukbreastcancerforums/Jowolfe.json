      "Content": "Hello Sal,  Thank you so much for your reply. It's was very welcoming. I cried as soon as I started reading but I can honestly say by the end (still crying) I did feel maybe there is going to be light at a very long and dark tunnel.  It's so hard when you have so many plans in place that you want to do and see with your children when something like this gets thrown into the mix it puts doubts on everything.   I just need to play the waiting game now but I will definately be reporting back on here as I already feel I will need support off anyone that has been through this themselves.  Xx",

      "Content": "Hello,  On Monday I went into my local hospital as I found a large mass in my right breast and was referred by my doctor.  They examined me, had an ultrasound, mammogram and thenot biopsy by core needle. I was then told the worse news that the mass was abnormal and on a scale of 1-5 I was a 4 of being diagnosed with breast cancer. On top of that theyou had picked up some calcium deposits in my left breast and needed to have biopsies of them too. I did go back today for a mammogram biopsy and now I have to wait until Wednesday for all my results.  The reason I am writing this as at this time is due to the fact I can't sleep with worry. I have three young boys.. 6, 4 and 2 and ever time I think about it I think about leaving them. Everyone keeps saying keep positive but it's hard last year as one of my aunties died after getting breast cancer a few years back and then it came back into her bones and lung. I'm so scared that I'll fight it but then it will return and I'll leave my boys. I'm only 31 I'm constantly emotional and keep asking why me.  I find I Google everything that goes through my mind and it's making it all worse. I'm a worrier anyway and I've been waiting for something to happen to take me away from my children and now I feel like this is it.  I feel so low and don't feel like I've any future now.  Thanks for listening xx",

      "Content": "Hello,  Been to the hospital today. I was given this appointment last Monday but was told probably won't have all my results but I went anyway.   It's been confirmed I have grade 3 breast cancer in my right breast.  I need to wait until Wednesday for my results from my left breast.   It's hormone positive which they said is a good thing and due to the size of the tumour they will look to remove the whole breast then radiotherapy, chemo and tablets for 10 years. I've asked about reconstruction but maybe limited due to having radiotherapy. I should hopefully have a date for surgery when I go back on Wednesday.  They did say they won't know if it's spread until I have surgery.   Joanne ",

I think trying to hold it together when they were giving me my news, hit me when I was in bed and all sorts were going through my head. This morning was the same very emotional. After I watched loose women about suffering with breast cancer I became a little more positive again. However back to the hospital tomorrow for more results so could be another emotional night.  Hope you are OK lovely xx",
