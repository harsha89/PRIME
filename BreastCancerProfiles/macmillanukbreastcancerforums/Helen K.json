I was also very anxious about it but dealing with the side effects is enough to cope with so stopped worrying about my hair. I still have a fringe so look ok in a beanie and have a great wig just in case.  I spent hours thinking and googling about cold cap and hair loss it was a relief to \u2018let it go\u2019  hope the ear gets better too. ",

I am very small busted and my new implant is a good C cup leaving my healthy A cup breast looking lost in any kind of bra. I will contact the BCN to discuss getting some sort of prosthesis to help me for now but has anyone had symmetrising surgery using an implant to make a healthy breast larger. The suggestion is a lift and implant to try and match them up.  I am still waiting to find out if I need chemo so my emotional state is shakey  to say the least. I will receive my oncotype results next Monday - it will have been a 7 week wait!  If no chemo hoping to have the symmatrising surgery sooner rather than later  so I can begin to feel more like me again.  Any advice greatly received ",
