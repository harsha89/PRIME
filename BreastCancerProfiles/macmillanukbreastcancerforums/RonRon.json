      "Content": "Hello.... I had my delayed reconstruction just last week! I am home now and as I live alone, I was so worried about the whole process. I can tell you that I am truly amazed and grateful for the experience since last week. It is strange getting used to being two boobed again but I am delighted with the outcome. Just one week later I can say, confidently, I made the right decision for me. I am on tamoxifen and i hate it. Like you, I have been dog tired and also had troubles with my hips. I wish you well with the decision process and you need to do what feels right for you. Please let me know if you you want to know more, I would be happy to help. I went to Broomfield hospital in Essex. xxxx",

This is my first reply to anyone.   All this must be horrible for you and I know how it feels not to share but, seems to me, you should think about talking to someone close to you. You need and deserve support.   I will be thinking of you. X",
