    "Content": "Hello Ladies...in 2008 I had a full mastecomy with tram flap reconstruction. About 6 weeks ago I found a lump on my side, same side as mastecomy. I was confused as I thought they had taken all the breast tissue. Anyway, histology states that this new tumour is not hormone receptive like my previous tumour. So therefore I am confused..is this a new cancer altogether or a mutated form of the original? It's a bizarre illness.",
