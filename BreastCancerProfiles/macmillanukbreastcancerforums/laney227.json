    "Content": "Hi! After my first mammogram in April I was recalled! Sent to local breast unit couple days later where they discovered after another mammogram ultrasound and biopsy I had what they were more or less sure was radial scarring! Fast forward one week, called to be told it was as suspected and would need to be removed! It\u2019s as another reply says cells which mimic cancer cells and until biopsied can\u2019t rule out anything sinister! If you\u2019ve been told it\u2019s radial scarring then please don\u2019t worry they will remove it with a vacuum biopsie and you will be fine. I will say the vacuum biopsie is very uncomfortable unlike the needle biopsie so take some kind of painkiller before you go! Good luck! I\u2019m on the bus writing this with no specs so please excuse any typos",
