Once treatment begins you really will feel better but until then feel free to come on here and be as grumpy as you like. We all understand. As for wanting your mum and dad, I'm nearly 60 and when I was diagnosed the person I really wanted to talk to was my mum but unfortunately she died six years ago. I think it is because our mums are the only people who know us as we really are. I know I certainly put on a 'brave ' face for everyone else but my mum would have known how I truly felt. So rant and rail as much as you like and we will try to give you the support your mum would if she could - starting with a big (virtual) hug. Xx",

The single mum struggling to arrange childcare around chemo, the elderly lady living alone, the builder not sure how to tell his mates on the building site that he's got BC, the woman who has 'got everything' and is therefore expected to sail through treatment but is screaming inside.  We are all individuals with our own experiences. There is no 'right' way to feel and no-one should feel guilty because they feel differently to anyone else!

      "Content": "Hi Nic, Yes it is possible to get BC at your age though it does become more common as you get older, and there are different types of BC. The important thing is that you have done the right thing in going to your GP to get checked out. Of course you will worry until you know for sure but hopefully you will get an answer at your appointment on Monday. Until then feel free to use this site and ask as many questions as you like but please don't 'google' your symptoms etc as there is a lot of inaccurate and out of date information out there! If your husband can go with you next week that would be great but, if not, try to take a friend with you. There will be a lot of waiting around so you'll want someone to talk to and it helps to have someone else listening to what you are told in case you forget as soon as you leave the hospital. Good luck, and let us know how you get on. xx",

Ultimately though YOU are the only person who will get yourself through it, albeit with all the  help, support and love from people around you (and that includes all the people on this site. I think if you read 'Dreamthief's post again you will see that it was in no way intended as a criticism, but rather as encouragement. We have all benefited from George's words of wisdom).  My main positive is that my three daughters are much more likely to check themselves for lumps which may ultimately save their lives. I would happily go through cancer to achieve that. Ok, maybe not 'happily' but I would certainly 'endure' it. Tomorrow is another day so I'm sending big hugs that the clouds lift a little for you.

My husband called the hospital and he was told I would be fine once the anti-sickness drugs kicked in. By the next morning I was worse and my GP gave me an injection but it didn't help. That night I began hallucinating as I was dehydrated and I was admitted to hospital and put on a drip for five days.   My oncologist reduced the chemo dose before my second lot and also prescribed Emend and that helped.   Please seek help if the vomiting continues. You can be given other drugs which will help but make sure they give you them sooner rather than later.   Good luck with the rest of your treatment. Things WILL get better.   Barbara x      ",

I have been completely off sex since my diagnosis in 2012, not because I am embarrassed about my body but because I am no longer interested. I was 58 when I was diagnosed so I am a bit older than you and my husband is a few years older than me. I must admit that I do occasionally feel guilty but I know my husband loves me and sex was only ever a small part of our relationship.  I too am on Anastrozole so I don't know if that has affected my feelings in any way. To be honest I think I was probably losing interest before I started taking it. I think the important thing is that you and your husband are both honest about your feelings. He sounds very understanding and I am sure he is just happy to still have you with him to share his life with!  Barbara xx",

A few days ago my other breast became very tender, felt hard and looked bruised.  Today it also has a bright red line across it. I already had an appointment for a check-up with my oncologist today so I asked him to have a look, expecting him to dismiss it as nothing important so I was surprised when he said he would book me in for an ultrasound and biopsy!  Hopefully they will be done soon but I know I'll worry until I know the results.

I am already annoyed because I was told that I would have mammograms on both sides but when I attended I was told new NICE guidelines said they could only do the 'non-reconstructed' side and if I had concerns about the reconstructed side (which I do) then my GP could request an ultrasound. She, however, said it will be quicker to go through my breast care unit. I'm going round in circles! I have been waiting for the results before I contacted the unit but I guess I had better phone them on Monday. The official NHS site says that we and our GPs will be sent the results within two weeks but that is obviously wrong. Oh well, what a surprise!

It may be that they have painful issues in their own lives that your diagnosis has stirred up for them, or maybe they just don't know what to say and are frightened of saying the wrong thing so say nothing at all. I told everyone about my BC and left them to deal with it in their own way. Yes I had cards, emails and offers of help from people I didn't expect to hear from and not from those I did but that's fine. We'll pick up our friendship again later. As for support, well my family has been fantastic but I'm happy dealing with this in my own way. I don't want people coming to the hospital with me. I would rather read a book during chemo than feel the need to make polite conversation. I attend consultant's appointments on my own because that way I can pass on the information I feel people need to know and keep other things to myself. I don't want people fussing and worrying if they don't need to. I have now had my mx and chemo and I'm halfway through rads. The mx didn't bother me at all, chemo was very rough but I got through it and so far I'm sailing through rads. Everyone is different and we all find our own way of coping. I found mine and I know there are people there if and when I need them but I'm happy for people to get on with their own lives too. I'm the one with BC.

I was then given a provisional date for September, then October, then November..... Finally I have been given a 'definite' date of February 12th. The trouble is that I'm not sure I want it now! It is two and a half years since my mastectomy and to be honest being without a breast doesn't bother me that much. Do I really want to put myself through a long operation and recovery period? I also worry that it would be more difficult to spot any recurrance of the cancer. There are days when I think of course I should have it done as I know people who have gone through it say they have never regretted it, ( and I'll get a free tummy tuck), but I also have days when I think it isn't worth it. I just can't decide. Maybe I should just toss a coin! Xx",

As my hospital has a 'one stop shop' I was lucky and all my tests were done at that appointment and I was given the diagnosis the same day. That was a Monday and I had a mastectomy on the Friday so it all happened very quickly. Obviously every case is different and while I was happy to get everything sorted quickly I know other people have to wait for results and  /or choose to take time to consider their options. I just wanted rid of the lump as soon as possible!

      "Content": "I have read a lot on here lately about the decisions people are making about conventional vs alternative treatment, mastectomy vs lumpectomy etc. Of course everyone is different and must choose their own path but for me there was no decision to make. I want the best possible chance of living to see my children grow up and get married etc, and enjoy retirement with my wonderful husband. I have a fantastic medical team who have been very kind and supportive and I trust them completely. When I was told I should have a mastectomy because the lump was close to my nipple I agreed immediately and had the operation three days later. What is a breast compared to my life? I am beginning chemo etc next week and of course I am not looking forward it but it is a necessary evil and I am so grateful to all those women who have taken part in trials in the past to enable me to have the best treatment they can offer me. I am also thankful that I live in a country where the treatment is available and I don't have to worry about paying for it. We all moan about the NHS occasionally but it is fantastic when we really need it! So I will beat this thing with all the expertise that is out there! Good luck to you all, whichever route you choose to take. xx",

Thanks to him, too, for taking part in the trials to help others. It is great to hear of your friend's recovery too! xx",

The only thing I feel able to eat is jelly (which won't keep me going for long). Has anyone else gone through this and found anything that helps? And how long is it likely to last? Any advice gratefully received! xx",

Mistakes happen but, as you say, it doesn't take much for people to check their facts before delivering devastating news. I hope you get an apology and answers as to how this happened. In the meantime I think you deserve to spoil yourself with wine and chocolates!! xx",
