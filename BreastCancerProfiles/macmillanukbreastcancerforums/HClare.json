      "Content": "Hi HappyFeet1 I too had lumpectomy, SNB & 3 weeks radiotherapy this year over the summer.  Now 5 months into a 10 year tamoxifen journey. I took around 3 weeks off work after the op  but I am incredibly lucky to have an amazing, flexible employer / job (part time and can work from home sometimes).   During RT I predominantly worked from home.  However. If I hadn\u2019t been able to do so I would very definitely have struggled to maintain working throughout the whole thing, I found it exhausting - although I didn\u2019t realise how much it took it out of me until a while later.  In fact, this week will be the first week that I will work my usual 5 (short) days in the office (and I don\u2019t have a manual job lol!!) since my op in mid-May. So, please don\u2019t underestimate the time needed for your  recovery, listen to your body and take whatever time you need fully recuperate.  The very best of luck to you.   Clare ",

Just reporting in to say that i had my 1st of 15 zaps this morning and all fine - I was very apprehensive about this treatment (not usually a worrier ) but I think it was fear of the unknown.  Had I seen the machine and how it all works before today, might have allayed my apprehension!  All good though.  I didn\u2019t realise that they zap the whole of your breast, I thought it would only be the area around the lumpectomy site - it makes perfect sense though. Good luck to us all as we continue with our treatments.  I\u2019m not really a footie fan ....but have got caught up in World Cup Fever so v excited for the match tonight!!!  Clare x",

With my HR hat on, I\u2019m so maddened to hear that you weren\u2019t looked after better by your employer.  It doesn\u2019t take much for your line manager/HR manager to just even drop you a note every couple of weeks to check in on you.  You should most definitely not be pressurised by them to return!  Do you have any annual leave left you could possibly use? You mentioned you will ask for reduced hours as in a phased return which is an excellent idea especially as I expect  you\u2019ll be paid more than SSP by doing so (how the gov think anyone can survive on SSP is a mystery).  In any case an employer has to consider any request for flexible working ie reduced hours/condensed hours/home working etc temporarily or permanently.
