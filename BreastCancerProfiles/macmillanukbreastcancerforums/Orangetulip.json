Loads of support here and endless information. But, I know I needed help on a more personal level, I was drowning in the news That I had to go through chemo as well as surgery. There are centres around the country that give face to face support, counselling, activities and sometimes the hand to help you through all the pain of the diagnosis. Your sister could ask her bcn if there is a centre near you she could access. I did, and it has helped so much. But this site and all the ladies with experience to share, stories to tell will also help. Someone always has an answer here, no matter how strange, forlorn or even happy your post is. Good luck, to both you, who are doing the most amazing thing a sister could do at this time, and to your sister. X",

I am not keen on reconstruction, more surgery, possible More problems and to be honest, at the moment I don't feel it it a priority. But of course that might Change in the future. Probably don't know enough about reconstruction. I think my basic problem Is I have had horrific experiences in hospital in the past and just want to get in and out as quick as possible. Have a mtg with surgeon next week so will have a chat about my concerns before the op the following Week. Really good to have support from ladies who know what it is all like, means a lot. X",

But for me, I don't want the small chance of another op a week later if not all the cancer removed. I not sure, as I seem to be relatively lucky and it is small, I want to go through radiotherapy unless I really have to. And with a past history of nhs treatment, I am wary Of putting myself through potential hospital care for months. I think I have a viewpoint that might not be the same as many ladies, but I just want as little hassle as possible, for my whole well being. This all sounds pathetic when I write it down, but life can be complicated enough, as I have learnt, so at my age, maybe this is the right decision for me. At least I am fortunate enough to have a decision. I have learnt a lot in a short time about cancer and how it works, how people cope. It is amazing. Thank you all, I go into hospital on 9th sept. I hope tomorrow is a lovely day for everyone x",

Want as much peace of mind As possible. Leaning toward mx as I understand less future problems. Handy advice, experience anyone can share would be great. Thanks",

So, having read various Messages regarding everything from wigs, flu jabs (or being denied, one, unbelievable) to nail problems, I am trying to get my act together, but don't understand all the finer details. Flu jab booked Not sure what to do about wig, bit scary Dentist on my list Can't work out the black nail polish thing, ben never heard of it Oil...what was that for??? What other tips are there to make life and body cope better?? Feel as though I fell asleep and woke up in a strange movie production where my life and body have Disappeared into an alien world, anyway, hopefully drains come out tomorrow, beats moaning About politicians I suppose.

I keep being told go and Get a wig, I know nurses mean well, but a wig is acceptance of my fate. I know everyone reacts Differently, but apart from loosing my hair which is so hard to come to terms with, I can't image I Will be reaction free. I don't feel I can make any decisions, I just keep being told you are having this op, then actually You have to have more surgery.

I have quite a big problem with hospitals, unfortunately past experiences have left me with post traumatic stress, so Being prepared helps me to cope. Having said that, I am not coping too well at the moment, and again Hearing that others find it difficult, is reassuring to me. I feel I am not alone in feeling apprehensive. I wish I could exist without looking too far ahead Sonia, but I have to consider all possibilities and measure My safety. Ultimately I will have to put my trust in the nhs, and that is a problem for me. Just tell myself it will be ok, all over soon, these people know what they are doing.
