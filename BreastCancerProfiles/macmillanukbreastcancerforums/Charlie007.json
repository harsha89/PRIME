      "Content": "Hello- I had my last of 4no Docetaxel today. Unfortunately I have found the taste issues last most of the 3 week cycle i'm on - i get about 5 days at the end when it gets better. Ginger is good- my favourite is stem ginger cookies- ginger also helps decrease nausia. I found sweet things good- but not for the waist line! I found cooked fruit especially with spices such as cinnamon ginger nutmeg good-so Christmas was quite good. Best meal for me is a breakfast of organic oat porridge with dry fruit and seeds and with milk mixed in cooked in microwave  for 3 mins then add and mix in a bit more milk and chopped up mixed fresh fruit- set me up for the day. On the drink front try Dry ginger ale- can let it go flat if you like and cranberry and cherry squash (Sainsbury's 50% juice squash range). Many advise pineapple is good. re the effects to tongue and mouth- it is usual to get thrush every time- white tongue- also affects other parts as well. This can be treated by Fluconazol tablets -which treat the whole body and Nystatin drops just for the mouth. I found the Fluconazol by far the most effective. Also brush teeth after each meal and regularly  use Dyflam mouth wash- I got through 2 bottles each 3 week cycle. Best of luck with your treatment X",

      "Content": "I had a terrible time with very painfull fingers, nails and toes after my first treatment with Docetaxol- it felt like my finger nails were in a clamp or had been hit with a hammer. I also got bad pins and needles and found doing fiddley jobs with my hands difficult- but thanks to people like you on the forums sharing their experiences and advice -I used a freezer cooling element wraped in a teacloth and plastic carrier bag to keep my hands cool during my second and subsequent treatments and I took my shoes and socks off and Im pleased to say i have had no pain or pins and needles in my hands and feet since.  Iv discussed this with my hospital and they are researching into it for other patients on taxol Im also keeping all my nails painted very dark and keeping my hands and feet as cool as pos- wearing flipflops or nothing at home and using special thin 'cool' socks (available from outdoor/walking shops). i think im also lucky that im having my chemo over the winter months although its been unseasonably warm in the UK this winter- I always feel a bit better when the weather is cold and clear. I also keep my hands and feet regularly moisturised with cream-day and night and after bath- keep hands and feet out of hot bath water though. I have also used the special neoprene cool cap for all my treatments-( 4no epirubicin with cyclophosphamide and 4no docetaxol)- iv lost about 30% of my hair but mainly where I wore a bandana as a hair band- probably because this made my scalp too hot under the band- so iv stopped wearing it except for 'special occassions and only now wear the thinest I have. Also had my hair cut short to take alot of the weight of it and bought several very high 600 thread egyptian cotton pillow cases that were very smooth to reduce heat and drag on hair at night and i frequently turn it if awake at night to keep cool. Other advice I can share- I found ginger great for stopping/ reducing nausea- (lots of cookies with large lumps of crystal/ stem ginger! ) and honey helped reduce sore mouths and tonge (can use Manuka but any good honey worked). Kept as active as i felt I could and lots of fresh air and i carried on working but very reduced hours to keep some normality in my life- also reward yourself arrange special outings etc when you are feeling a bit better at the end of each cycle- i found going to music events/concerts with friends particularly uplifting also  riding (when up to it)/ being with my horse a very good therapy.",
