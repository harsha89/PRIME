      "Content": "Hi Tess, I think you may have misunderstood me perhaps I didn't explain myself very well. Yes I agree in priciple with Marian and yourself. But as you know people are very complex and different   with many different  factors to take into account..  I elected for mastectomy instead of radiotherapy  as I already have skin problems.  The issue of funding is only about which type of mastectomy because my hospital does not employ  plastic/micro surgeons. My consultant has agreed  my choice is valid and logical .He has no problems and could have  done  the mastectomies using different techniques., I selected the diep becase I have fibromyalga and as you know that causes severe muscular pain so I don't want the other methods that  cut into and manipulate the muscle  for me it would just cause more ongoing long term problems.    I also understand that because  I have lots of family members with cancer or who have died from cancer it doesn't neccessarily mean a genetic link. However, Our family were tested  at Newcastle  for  a genetic link which proved positive.Although it wasn't the brca. However there are lots of genes involved in cancers. I'm not too worried  now , I know something will get sorted . I also understand why you say I should be lucky that my breasts are intact  I would feel lucky if they were completely disease free  since  the lumpectomy,  but they are not., however, because I have Lympho /vascular invasion . I know only too well  from first hand experience [in my biography]and reading the stories on here  how utterly devastating and complex  and destructive  cancer can be and yes I count myself incredibly fortunate  by comparison. Nevertheless it is my personal responsibilty to ensure I get the best options I possibly canfor myself  in terms of treatment.  and that is all I am trying to do.  I hope Tess I clarified  things somewhat. Thankyou for your  comments and I do hope you continue to feel well.  Best wishes Anne x",

Who is Wendy Watson? Hope your recovery is going welm, much love Anne xx",

      "Content": "Hi Marian, Thankyou for your valid comments. Yes you are right about the under 50 thing for breast cancer. Our family were tested some years ago and though we tested positive it wasn't for the common brca genes . However, we have been advised that we have a significant risk factor . Regarding the lumpectomy ,I was offered a mastectomy but chose to wait until they could organise funding for the diep at another hospital .Consequently my consultant advised me to have a lumpectomy to 'take the heat out of the situation ' while waiting for thediep mastectomy.  I ttrust and respect him and took his advice . Hence I am still waiting for the mastectomy  because there is still evidence of lympho vascular invasion . I know removing both or any breast is no guarantee against recurrence but neither is chemo or hormone therapy all any of us can do is hit it with what we can and then hope and pray we have done enough to stop it recurring.. I'm also aware that it could recur  in other areas  but like I said before all I can do is hit it with whatever is available at the time, to at least eliminate its chances. I have lived with cancer most of my adult life and  am used to the highs and lows the fears and worries and nothing will ever be as horrific as  what my daughter went through , nor what I feel since losing her to cancer. Like you , I  have learned to live  one day at a time I started doing that  over thirty years ago and it has stood me in good stead so has my sense of humour and glass half full attitude. So good on you living for te moment it is the best way to cope. You are only a year  into your post diagnosis and treatment  So it is realatively early days .  I'm glad you finished your chemo and radio its a gruelling process and can leave you feeling more ill than the flipping cancer! What  a lovely thing to look forward to  ,your pending grandchild. I would love a grandchild  but my son only married last year and there isn't one on the horizon yet ...I live in hope a ha.  How wonderful that your daughter is getting married .You must be busy looking for a special outfit . No my cancer definately is not ruining my life. People would not know  I had it unless I told them .I'm just getting on as I did before and I have quite a jolly nature and a good circle of friends and family . so I am very lucky.  I hope you continue to keep well . Take care Marian , best wishes Anne      ",

      "Content": "Hi all, I have just had a  lumpectomy whch cleared the cancer from my right breast and nodes were clear so I count myself very fortunate. However, I dont want the radiation option for the follow on treatment..Instead I want  to take the mastectomy option, and  have a bilateral mastectomy for prophylactic reasons. However it was mentoned  today at my post op appt that the PCT may not fund  a bilateral mastectomy and reconstruction because they would question why remove a healthy left breast. I explained  why I was hoping to have a bilateral mastectomy with diep construction; 1. My general health is as good as it will ever be, in the future it definately wont be as good as it is at the present time because I have Bronchiectasis, Asthma and fybromyalgia. So if I am to undertake any operations now is the time to have them and prevent  a recurrence where possible whether it is breast cancer or any other type of cancer.. 2. Although I haven't been tested for the hereditary breast cancer gene ,There is a weakness for cancer in my immediate family, my aunt [mothers side]womb cancer, my mother  womb cancer,2 brothers bowel cancer, 1 brother duodenal cancer, 1 brother throat cancer, my daughter god bless her cancer of the cervix [15months old] then later cancer of the bladder. Consequently I  am  determined to give myself the best chance I can in terms of prevention and treatment. 3. By opting for a bilateral mastectomy with a diep reconstruction now, it  would leave me the option of having radiotherapy way down the line if any cancer attacks in the future. I would be better able to withstand  radiotherapy down the line than an aneasthetic. 4. The choice of a diep reconstruction is because  I dont want implants I dont want  re constructions that  either manipulate or cuts good muscle  which  I need. For me it  it seems a barbaric procedure .Though I do respect those ladies who have had it done .  Its just not for me. If the PCT does refuse funding  is there anything I can do? what steps can I take .I would really appreciate your views and experiences. Many thanks Anne x  ",

      "Content": "Hi all hope you had as best a christmas as  was possible and may the new year be kind to you. I have just been told that I am not suitable for a bilateral mastectomy and diep  reconstruction due to the risk of the long aneasthetic on my lungs. However, they have said they will proceed with doing the diseased breast and if it recurs in the future in the other breast they can deal with it  at that time thus sparing further damage to my lungs. I am happy with that decision . My only query is ,  my breasts are going to look different.  So will I be eligible to have the other breast augmented  to match the reconstructed breast ? It is something I forgot to ask my surgeon and I won't be seeing him or another 3 weeks so I would welcome your answers.I am just aware of cut backs and am worried that matching up the breasts would be seen as a vanity issue . Many thanks , love and hugs Anne x",

Sounds like your surgical team were excellent  8hrs is a long time but shorter than expected for this kind of op. I won't need  any intervention on my ovaries because I had a total hysterectomy when I was 35.   Its a long road  before you are out of the woods yet  .All credit to you for your positive attitude. I know what you mean about doing all you can in terms of attacking it from as many angles as possible with whatever is available. At least then you know you have done your damdest! Keep me updated with our progress. I hope you don't feel too sore. Very best wishes and love Anne xx",

      "Content": "Hiya Barbara, I'm in limbo at the moment it is now a question of whether the PCT  will fund the bi lateral diep reconstruction choice. My breast nurse asked me again to consider radiotherapy as it could take months to get a decision. However, so far I have stood my ground for my treatment choice but I do feel a bit on my own with this issue now. I started a new forum post re  PCT and funding Patient choice. But it hasn't aroused any interest or replies so I am assuming others are having an easier time in terms of funding and choice? I don't know. Maybe I'm just on an off day but I was hoping to gain some knowledge about how others have dealt with PCTS. No worries .How are you feeling ? Anne x",
