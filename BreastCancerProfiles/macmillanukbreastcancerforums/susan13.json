      "Content": "I had lumpectomies for two tumours in June and then a further operation in July to remove all lymph nodes because there was a microdeposit of cancer in one of my lymph nodes - now I am waiting for radiotherapy and have been prescribed arimidex. After reading all the possible side effects of this drug I am a little worried particularly about the joint problems. Has anyone taken this drug - any comments on this. Would be really grateful as I am hesitating to start this drug at the moment. Thanks to all",
