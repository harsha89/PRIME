      "Content": "hi, I'm so sorry you are having this trouble. How did it go the next day? I had great veins before chemo, but like you by the 4th lot of chemo they weren't playing any more! It took 7 tries. I found a hot pack which they warmed in the microwave for me helped on some occasions. I didn't need herceptin otherwise the nurses said they would have offered me a Hickman line after the trouble at session 4. Sessions 5 and 6 took about 3 goes each so not so bad. One thing I feel should have been discussed with me in more detail before starting chemo is the fact that chemo destroys your veins. By the time my 6 FEC sessions were done the veins were all corded, knotted and sore and although the horrible lines up my forearm have got a lot better over the last 18 months, I still have terrible trouble with IV access, which made my life an absolute misery when I recently needed IV antibiotics in hospital ! If anyone is about to start chemo I would discuss the pros and cons of access in more detail with your oncologist.",

      "Content": "Hi I too have been having horrendous hot flushes with Tamoxifen. I have been having acupuncture in my ears which really helped to begin with but didn't last for very long and that was with acupuncture once a week for 8 weeks, followed by only a month respite before I needed more. . I have tried evening primrose oil but it had no effect at all. My oncologist suggested Venlafaxine last week which is really an antidepressant (which I don't need) but I was so fed up that I thought I would give it a go. I have to say that even a week later it is starting to make a difference. I hate using medication, even paracetamol, but I figure if I am on a major tablet like Tamoxifen I may as well  try another big one! I am still having hot flushes but not half as severe or frequent. It may be the combination of acupuncture and venlafaxine but hey if it works.....My partner said the other day that I hadn't taken my jumper off and frantically fanned myself at all one evening! I hadn't even noticed as I felt so normal. Same at night, only one or two mild ones instead of melting and sticking to the sheets three or four times a night. duvet on... duvet off.... By the way does anyone else get cold flushes too? they are much better now as well",

      "Content": "Hi, I too had neulasta injections when I had chemo in 2012. I wasn't given one after my first lot of chemo and ended up having to be admitted into hospital at 3am with a high temperature and neutropenic sepsis. Once I started the injections after subsequent rounds of chemo I didn't have any more problems with sepsis. I too noticed agonising pains across the back of my pelvis a couple of days after each injection ( which incidentally I gave myself) which I presumed was my bone marrow working overtime. I don't remember taking painkillers because I was delighted to know it was working!",

      "Content": "I've been on Tamoxifen for 19 months now. Acupuncture (on your ears) worked for me, in that the flushes were less frequent and less severe but it didn't take them away all together. I find I also get cold flushes too, not linked to being sweaty after a hot flush. My thermostat seems to be knackered! Haven't had acupuncture for a few months now, but the hot and cold flushes are definitely easing over time. I' m 55 and my periods stopped in the middle of FEC 2 years ago and never came back.",

      "Content": "Hi  I know exactly what you are going through having had the same last year. It is a very steep learning curve indeed but my only advice is not to think too far ahead,  take each stage as it comes. I was terrified of my mastectomy and it was absolutely fine, I had no pain and was home within 48 hours. I think you are very brave to get on a forum. Tonight is the first night I have joined a forum as last year I was too scared to talk to other people who had breast cancer for fear of what I would find out!   I am having reconstructive surgery on 12 november and am scared about that now, but at least I have the mastectomy and chemo behind me. you WILL  get through it, just don't look too far ahead. thinking of you   Sonia xx",

      "Content": "I  wish I liked chocolate but I don't !! crisps for me any day. I have worked for the NHS for 30 years as a  senior midwife and I don't know if it helps but the vast majority of doctors, nurses (and midwives, although not really relevant to our predicament!) are genuinely caring and competent. To be honest it's often private consultants who worry me more as they are often older and less up to date and only interested in the money.  I am especially critical as I know what I should expect. I have to say I had every faith in my breast surgeon last year and have every faith in my plastic surgeon who is doing my reconstruction. that doesn't stop me being terrified of stupid things like waking up and being unable to move in the middle of the operation. When I told my surgeon about this fear last year he said \" I promise we will not be using any paralysing drugs in your anaesthetic and if you wake up during this you will be able to kick me in the face!\"  You say you have to measure your safety and I don't know what experience caused your PTSD ( I suspect it may be childbirth) but as you say you have no real choice but to put your faith in them. I am lucky too, mine was relatively  slow growing and had not spread to my lymph nodes but I had 3 areas of mixed DC and LC that I had no idea existed until I had my first routine mammogram. Isn't the NHS fantastic that it discovered them for me?! Absolutely no system is perfect and every area and every walk of life has it's bad and good people or methods . Try to focus on the good ones!! I will be thinking of you when you have your op. Let us know how it goes. XX",

I can understand your fear of surgery, like others,  in a way I was lucky in that I had surgery (skin sparing mastectomy) first. I am a medical person but I was absolutely terrified of the surgery and in the end it was fine - no pain and home within 48 hours. I didn't care about the loss of nipple I have to say, anything was better than the alternative. My final chemo course was exactly a year ago. I am lucky in that I have a lovely partner but at the end of the day he doesn't REALLY understand what I am going through. He has never had an operation or barely a day's illness in his life so how can he?  When I was going through chemo he coped by doing extra shifts to make up for my pay reduction while I was on half pay. But what I really wanted was him at home with me.   I have just received a date for my reconstruction op (abdominal DIEP ) in November and already he is planning to go  to work on 12 hour shifts within 2 days of me getting out of hospital!!  I have told him I need him with me at home but I know he will be restless to get on with \"jobs\" around the house and garden. He really doesn't understand what a big op it is with 2 wounds.  I think I am even more stressed about the reconstruction than I was about the original mastectomy, I am having so many sleepless nights. I don't mean to sound ungrateful and I love him dearly but I guess what I am saying is at the end of the day you have to get on with it by yourself and no one but someone who had been through the same thing can ever understand how it feels.
