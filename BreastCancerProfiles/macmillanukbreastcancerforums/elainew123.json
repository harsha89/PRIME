    "Content": "Hi Jacqui I have LBC too and am going in for my op later on today. I was lucky enough to have a surgeon who agreed to do a bi-lateral reduction at the same time as removing the tumour. I know some people will think it's purely vain on my part to have a cosmetic procedureÂ but I can't help thinking they might find something in my other breast that wasn't picked up on a scan. My LBC is very deep so I would have been left lopsided and scared witless. After reading some of the comments on this site, I'm glad I chose to have everything done in one go. How are you feeling now??",
