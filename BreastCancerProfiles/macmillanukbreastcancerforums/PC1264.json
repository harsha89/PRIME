    "Content": "Hi. I had my mastectomy a year ago this week. I kept an open mind of what to expect and said \"goodbye\" to my left breast the night before my op! I also recommend you take iPod and earphones as well as sports bra and if you can get bra extenders it will help as it's more comfortable to have it looser round your back.  Be prepared to stay for some time and take a couple of flannels to cool you down in case you get hot (if you are having the bear hugger hot blanket). Good luck. Stay positive. You will be in safe hands. ",
