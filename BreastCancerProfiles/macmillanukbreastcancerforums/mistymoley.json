      "Content": "Hi Clare Being monitored is a good thing. They will be able to spot any changes in the before and after CT scan, and perhaps if there are more changes there will be a biopsy.  Not being usual practice just means that most follow ups are straightforward, but there are always some that fall outside the bounds of average. Whoever wanted to be average, anyway?  Seriously, worry will not help anything, and if anything make things worse.  Enjoy every day while you can, try not to worry about the future, plan some nice bits, like days out, nice food, meeting with friends, doing new things.  Keep busy and the time will soon pass.",

Luckily, I was allowed to have the prophylactic Mx at the same time, and like you, have two Beckers. I know that you don't have any other options than implants, and my other reason was that you just don't end up with a matched pair naked if they're not, well, matched ... LOL ... and obviously that's important to you in particular. The only note of caution I would add about the Beckers is that I've recently been told they may not be able to remove the entire tube, and this is the main thing that I hate about them now (I still have my ports and the tube).  So depending on whether I will have the entire tube removed or not will inform my decision on whether I have them replaced with standard implants.

I said that I needed it done for my mental health.  The hoops I had to go through were a) an MRI to prove/disprove there was anything wrong with the other one (there wasn't), then a second opinion from another surgeon to make sure I wasn't having it done for \"cosmetic\" reasons, ie, a boob job.   For me it was partly cosmetic though - I wanted to end up with a matched pair, which I wouldn't have if only one had been done. It would have looked ok in clothes, but like Rebecca, I wanted to look good naked. And the mental anguish if they were unmatched wasn't to be discounted.  This may sound very shallow, but put that with the fact that three of my aunts had breast cancer, I felt there was a real possibility that I could carry the BRCA gene as well, and it would have been unbearable.  I never wanted to hear the words \"You have  breast cancer\" again, and whilst I do know that it could come back in the future elsewhere, I think I've done everything humanly possible to prevent that.  So persevere, ladies, if you're sure, and go for what you want.  I had my surgery at Bedford, by the way.",

Free SGAP flap (Superior Gluteal Artery Perforator flap) or the IGAP flap (Inferior Gluteal Artery Perforator flap) This uses fat and skin taken from the upper or lower buttock to create a new breast. It is generally used when abdominal tissue cannot be used due to scarring from previous surgical procedures or because the woman is too slim. The IGAP flap gives a softer feeling to the breast than the SGAP flap. The IGAP flap allows a larger breast size to be created and the scar is hidden in the crease of the buttock. HTH Helen ",

      "Content": "hedgewitch Hi Mistymoley. Actually it is probably a good job I didn't join at the beginning of my treatment. I lost what friends I had then by snapping at them. I would hate to have done that here and embarrassed myself. I got sick of people telling me to be positive. Sick of people saying they had a friend who had cancer and they were able to do this, that, and the other. And people telling me I'd be fine, then changing the subject. I am normally a very laid back person who agrees with people to keep the peace. But the cancer made me touchy to start with. So I lost all my friends by telling them it wouldn't be the cancer, or the treatment that would kill me, but people stressing me out. Now I just have five cats to support me through this, who don't deliberately upset me. I was fine doing it on my own. Then last night I suddenly felt a bit lonely and decided to join others who knew how I felt. Ah but the difference here is we all get it. We don't try to make you be brave, or positive.  If you want a good old rant, you can come here and do it safe in the knowledge that we've all been there at some point or another. We won't fallout with you, because we know what it's like.  That the worry is always in the background, sometimes further back than others, that although you look fine, you feel disfigured, vulnerable, weakened.  That passes, eventually, but it's a long hard road and we're here to walk it with you.",

      "Content": "Hi Emma Firstly, it seems as though you are lucky to have a good surgeon and some considerate care! Secondly, whilst I am sure that there are many people who are perfectly happy to live with the LD flap, I was offered it, but I was very sure to make sure that my surgeon knew that I had a very active lifestyle (I ride and look after 3 horses), and consequently they decided that it would not be a good option for me. I think the amount of strength people have does depend to quite an extent on the amount they use their muscles, so they may not notice much difference if they didn't use the muscle much before? Also, when I had a second opinion at the Royal Marsden in Chelsea, the surgeon said that they rarely perform the LD flap operation there anymore, finding the DIEP flap a much more satisfactory result, even though it is a bigger operation.  As they are a centre of excellence, you have to wonder why this is?  Especially in these days of cost savings.   I've currently got Becker \"permanent\" expanders, but I'm planning to have the DIEP flap next year after I've done a few things that need doing here. Hope this helps in some way.  Oh and if in doubt, get a second opinion! Helen ",

The hospital I had my original reconstruction done at doesn't do the DIEP flap either, they offered me implants or LD flap, or I could go to Stevenage for the DIEP but I was REALLY pushed towards the implants both by the surgeon and by my husband although bless him he really didn't realise that he was being manipulated at the time by the surgeon, who was really pushing the implants \"Why wouldn't you have these?  Why wouldn't you?\"  Erm because it's not such a good end result, and actually they don't last forever so they'll have to be replaced when I'm 62 and will I really need that at that age?  Plus they also don't feel the way they do when they're out of the body because you will implant them under the muscle ... blah blah blah I could go on.   Anyway, since then, I've been to the Royal Marsden for a second opinion, as well as the Norwich, who have both said that they would be more than happy to do a DIEP on me, so it really is a question of what YOU want.   One of the main reasons I wanted it was that we go on a lot of holidays, and I really needed to be able to wear a bikini ... ;) plus I actually know that even though he says otherwise, my husband would really struggle with me with only one boob.  But that's just me. The tummy tuck bit doesn't even bother me, I've had to actually put some weight on to have enough belly to do it ... :)",

Also, my muscles are compromised because the implants are under them - In theory I still have the strength, but in practice it feels weird in many ways and I REALLY can't open jars any more and sweeping is harder than it used to be! So they're not the end of the world, but you are right, there is ongoing maintenance.  I don't know if I'd bother later on - I guess it depends how good a job they do in the first place.  ",

The fact you are Stage 1 is in your favour, as it has been caught early, and I was the same.  I was given surgery and Tamoxifen which I took for almost 2 years and finally decided that the 1% difference wasn't worth it for me and I stopped.  But that was my personal decision.   I suggest you think very carefully about the options, because there is no failsafe against recurrence, but there are some things that are worth trying.",

I will say, though, that things are easing (Had my op in Nov, last expansion in March), and the scars do take a while to heal.  I'm talking about the internal ones, as well as the external.  So it may be that yours have healed tighter on the inside, and maybe some massage may help?  I would also talk to your plastic surgeon if you can - I can't, as mine is a bit of an arse, frankly.  Helen x",

It is vital to do the exercises after surgery,  but also to look after your arm so that you don't develop lymphodaema.  No blood pressure cuffs, or blood tests on that arm, be careful not to scratch it and protect from bites.   That said,  most people don't develop it, but you need to understand the risks.  ",

I've had becker expanders, as they recommended this as the best choice, since both LD and TRAM will use muscles and this will, inevitably, reduce strength.  My op was at the end of November.  I've been riding since, and had no problem although it does still feel weird, with the expanders fitted under the pectoral muscles.   I am considering the DIEP flap for my own reasons, but certainly there is no reason why the implants would cause any problem.  I do know someone who has had ongoing problems with the LD flap, which is one reason I personally wouldn't consider it, although obviously there are a lot of people here who have had them and are happy with the result.",

      "Content": "Hi Faith54 It's terrible to watch a family member with any disease, especially cancer.  Unfortunately unless you are in the position of having to make a decision you cannot know what you would do, you can only think you do.  It's best not to try to persuade your mum either way, because at the end of the day it has to be her decision, and whatever that is, you must support her.  (I know you will). I was 47 when I was diagnosed with a Grade 1 cancer.  Unfortunately although they tried to do a WLE (lumpectomy) it didn't have clear margins and the following attempt found further cancer cells, so I was told it would have to be a mastectomy.  At this point I was sure that I wanted both gone, I never wanted to hear the words \"you have breast cancer\" ever again and I also wanted reconstruction with a matching pair.  I did go for it, and I haven't regretted it, but I do now know that I may yet here those words again, as secondaries usually come back elsewhere in the  body.  That said, in your mother's case, she's had chemo, and not having radiotherapy isn't the end of the world, in fact there is now some thinking that it is overkill.   It was around 3.5 months from my initial diagnosis to final mastectomy with no chemo involved, and my surgeon was able to tell me that I was cured at the end of it. Usually the best you get is No Evidence of Disease (hence we have the NEDdy club here). One in 8 women will get breast cancer so the fact that there are a number in your family could just be pure bad luck, lifestyle, or genetic (even though your mum has been tested, they are getting better at these all the time, so it may be that they haven't found that link yet).  There is no point trying to work out why, but there is a good reason for you to be vigilant in your own checking, just in case.   One mastectomy is probably no easier to recover from than two, but possibly being even might be easier to live with in the long run.   I hope your mum has a successful operation whichever she chooses, and a speedy recovery.",

I know that where you are now is a very scary place, but there is a very good chance that you won't be here long.  None of us have x-ray vision or psychic ability, so we can't tell you that what you have is or isn't cancer.  But the good news is that plenty of women just like you turn up scared and worried and leave with a cyst or some minor issue. On the other hand, if it is cancer, it doesn't mean that you need to put your affairs in order!  Obviously it's always good to do that, but there is no rush, because 90% of all breast cancer patients are still alive and kicking over 5 years on (that's how long they did the stats for, and actually the figures are, by their nature, 5 years out of date!).  You have done the right thing by going to your GP, the hospital is now on your case, you will be fine as soon as you know what you are dealing with, and if you need a treatment plan.  I'm sure that there will be others along in a minute to reassure you.  I was diagnosed over 5 years ago myself and I am going strong!",

I have had a look here and there is some information on this page http://www.macmillan.org.uk/Cancerinformation/Cancertypes/Brain/Typesofbraintumours/Pituitarytumours.aspx (sorry, I can't do the fancy links like George does!) I'm sure it must be terrifying, but it's worth having a look in the brain tumour section of Macmillan, as I'm sure there will be people there who have more experience and can advise on treatments.  Big hugs and lots of love.

Above all I wanted my husband to tell me that he wasn't going anywhere and would stay with me whatever happened.  No matter how hard your wife tries to push you away, if you want to stay, push back, hug her tight and reassure her.

I know that the Macmillan nurses here are very knowledgable, but in this instance I think someone who knows your actual case is probably a better bet, although there's no harm in speaking to someone. If you are concerned, I would ask for a second opinion to put your mind at rest.  You have every right to this, just ask your GP to refer you to somewhere that's a cancer Centre of Excellence like the Royal Marsden (or ask him what is your most local one depending on your location) But to reassure you somewhat, the variables are often to do with age, weight, degree of hormone positivity, and sometimes what the surgeon/oncologist had for breakfast.  ",

I could have left it for a while until it was a problem but frankly I would have gone insane with worry. So the theory is good, but the woman in the programme said she would deal with it when it became a lump, and that doesn't always happen, and when it does, sometimes it's too late.   I can see that better testing is required.  ",

If you want to see my nipple tattooing being done, have a look at this video that shows it being done.  At the end they show you the result, but the skin is still bleeding, so it's not a true representation of the final thing but I can send you a photo of how they are now if you want (just send a friend request and a message). I had a double Mx and the second one was prophylactic (preventive).  I was asked if I wanted to retain the nipple and said no, because there is a 5% extra chance of recurrence.  The surgeon was very happy with this, and it did mean that the tattooist didn't have to colour match me, but I've never regretted it. I didn't have the nipple reconstruction, but could have had if I wanted.  The NHS tattooing does tend to fade, which is why I had mine done privately and permanently.",

Iron pills are probably ferrous fumerate that aren't readily absorbed by the body (but are cheap, hence from NHS).  I take Solgar Gentle Iron which I find non constipating and always take with Vit C for best absorption.  Then folic acid should be folate.  Not the same thing.  Vit D should be D3, and taken with K2 to transport the D3 to the bones otherwise it goes to places you DON'T want it like arteries.  B12 is best taken sublingually or in a spray.   Being in range isn't enough, you need to be in the right place in the range to be optimal so that all these things can work together.  Usually in the top quarter of the range.   When you get your results ask for printouts so you can check where you are in the ranges.  TSH should be 1 or below but it's hard to get doctors to medicate correctly because TSH only gives part of the picture (and is a flawed test anyway).   Sorry if you already know all this stuff, I usually PM it as it's not cancer related!",

This is partly why I asked for the double mastectomy with implant reconstruction. 2.  At first, all I could think about was my boobs.  it took about 8 months to really come to terms with them and get used to the feeling. They weren't exactly uncomfortable, but I was conscious of them and it was a bit like having a couple of flat pebbles duct taped to my chest all the time.  They DO soften in time, and I did not have a strattice \"hammock\" which is a more recent way of doing it, ask about that. 3. This is one reason I didn't want this! 4. No, you would have a mammogram as usual on the remaining breast. 5.  No, you can't do one on that side. In closing, I'm really pleased with my decision, I know that I would have hated being lopsided, so I asked for both to be done, which they agreed finally.  ",

I think 8 months is plenty long enough. Hope you find some help.",

Also,  in relation to what others have said, my BCN said to me on the first day that it would take a year of my life.  That terrified me, and still does if I think about it.  She wasn't entirely wrong, although treatment was mostly over in 6 months, the psychological stuff went  on longer, but it wasn't necessary to say at that moment (or any moment).   Living day to day with the treatments was hard enough.  ",

I think something may have got lost in translation with the woman you know with breast cancer and a brain tumour.  Breast cancer can metastasise in the brain, but it's unlikely that radiation was the cause.  I had a lump in my neck a few years after breast cancer.  I had an ultrasound and a biopsy, but it was just an enlarged node due to having had a cold not long before.  This is what they are designed to do, so probably why you were told it was 90% unlikely to be cancer.  TNBC can be sneaky though, and it's possible you are facing a recurrence.  It's also possible that you have some odd cells but they are not cancerous.  Fingers crossed.  Try not to dwell on it until you have results, keep busy.  You won't change the outcome and you will stress yourself silly.  And stress is not good for us.  If necessary, get something from your GP to calm you down for the duration. Good luck, and do let us know the outcome.",

It's a hard decision to make but I don't know if your mum has been informed that if she had a mastectomy, she could have a reconstruction. She should have a look either at the macmillan booklet here, or at keepingabreast.org which explains the options. At the end of the day, whether it comes back is something of a lottery but the oncologist would be able to give her the statistics either way if that would help. So it's worth asking the question. Secondly, there is a group here for carers. You may find some support here for you as you are holding the family together. And if there is a support group at your local hospital, do encourage your mum to go along. With the best will in the world, cancer is something that you can only understand if you have been there. And talking to people who get it can be very helpful. .",

I don't know if anyone is local to Felixstowe here, but in the meantime, feel free to come here and moan!  As to the peripheral neuropathy, hopefully as time goes on it will improve and you will get  back to normal.  Do let the GP and/or oncologists know what you are suffering as there are often things  that might help and certainly if they don't know then they can't help.  As soon as you are well enough, get on that bus and get yourself down to the support group - they really can help.  And if you are able to ask someone to drive you, all the better.  In fact, if you contact them, you may find someone lives just around the corner and can pick you up.   Hope you are feeling a bit better for getting it off your chest!

How would it be if it just overcame you during class and you had to be comforted by students? It would affect them and you.   As to how long, unfortunately everyone is different.  Rads continue to cook you for several weeks after and your skin could yet break down.  The tiredness is not to beunderestimated either.  I would say that you definitely wouldn't want to be going back this side of half term,  then see how you are, perhaps do part time until Xmas but let your body dictate. You are not a malingerer!   ",

Because it seems to me that the biggest obstacle in this whole sorry mess is a lack of understanding and your lack of self confidence.  I bet you are absolutely gorgeous, and most people would not notice,  If you really do want surgery, it's probably most practical to reduce the good breast to a similar size to the affected one, but why not get a medical opinion on your options?  ",

Yes, it may be more expensive, but you are entitled to a quality of life, and if you already have arthritis, it is bound to make it a lot worse.  You will end up costing the country a lot more if you become disabled and claiming benefit, not being able to work, etc etc.  I would explain that if you need to, but don't be afraid to be tearful in the surgery.  I said to someone earlier, be you on a bad day.  Perhaps take the prescription and go in on a really bad day and show them exactly how you feel.  If they had to feel like that, they'd get something prescribed.   Just a quick google, you can get them for £203.57 for two months supply, so if you need to, there are options.  Be careful where you get them though.  And I'm not saying that's the cheapest, just the first one I found.

I would put in a complaint, that's plain offensive.   Honestly, you cannot get back what you had, you know that.  Those of us who have had reconstructions of various types are not the same as before, whether we have implants, LD flap or DIEP/TUG/whatever reconstructions.  Mine are OK, but they have no feeling. Yes they are all right in clothes, my husband likes them, so that's good, but they can sometimes be painful, or uncomfortable. I hardly ever wear a bra, because I don't need to, but also because I find them painful if I wear them for any length of time. Be very careful if you go down the private route, because you need a plastic surgeon who is a member of BAPRAS, don't be tempted by someone because they are cheap,  Before going down this route, though, do ask your GP to refer you for some counselling. Because whatever your breast look like, unless you are happy with you, you will never be satisfied.",

Unless the cancer is extremely close to the chest wall.  There are statistics for radiotherapy, and for some people it is purely a belt and braces approach. Surgery will have removed the cancer and the precancerous cells, so it would be zapping healthy tissue or tissue removed from elsewhere.  If you go for a staged reconstruction you would have twice the risk of infection and if your skin is irradiated, it may not be suitable for reconstruction due to a change in structure.  These are all things you should discuss with your surgeon.  I'm sorry if I have thrown even more confusion into the mix, but it is as well to be informed! ",

It may be that they have seen something that the CT scan will define, and they're not ruling anything in or out at this stage.    Also, bear in mind that even with secondaries, treatments are coming on all the time, and people are still continuing to live a long time with all kinds of cancers.  Do come on and let us know how your mum gets on.  Helen xx",

You could tell her that you need the space to get away from the stress as stress is one of the things that can trigger cancer, and you can use that as a reason/excuse if she refuses to understand anything different.   At the end of the day, you and your husband need to stick together for each other.  Keep lines of communication open with your daughter, but discourage visits from the husband.  I'm sure the lovely Dorothee will be along with sage words of advice soon.  In the meantime, have a glass of mulled wine and a mince pie, and enjoy your Christmas.  If your traditions always involve your children/grandchildren, make a new tradition.",

I hope you have some good friends who will help you out.  But in the meantime, when you speak to your family, say to them \"Yes, I'll put my daughter in foster care, because my family obviously don't care enough to look after their own, she'll probably be better off\".   Honestly, I would be ashamed if my own sister had to do that rather than me help her, and I'm surprised that your family aren't.  Your mother sounds like a selfish person (sorry, had to be said), thinking about herself all the time.  Yes, she's 70, but that doesn't excuse poor behaviour.  If she's not well enough to look after your daughter, then say so. Don't make excuses. As to the party, well, everyone will ask why you're not there and they will have to say \"because you're too ill\" and it will look bad on them that they went ahead with it anyway.  I do wonder if your mum is feeling a kind of guilt and therefore pushing it back on you.  Your sister has no such excuse though. Anyway hopefully you can sort it all out.  If you really can't, call the Macmillan helpline (open 9am to 8pm Monday to Friday, 0808 808 0000) and ask to speak to someone about arranging help during chemo. Good luck, and know that we are all with you.  (If I was close to you I'd help).",

I know it seems like an eternity, and it is pointless me telling you not to worry, but hopefully we can reassure you a bit.  NICE guidelines say that you must commence treatment with 31 days.  Most people are inside this, but it might be close.  They are only guidelines, however, but be reassured that cancer cells do not generally rage out of control and go rampaging through the body in a few weeks.  I was very lucky to be screened and diagnosed in a one stop shop, even though it took an age on the day.  When people have to wait, it should mean that you get all the results at once.  If you are HER+, these results take a while longer so it would be understandable. Now, you haven't got a diagnosis yet, but let's assume you do get a cancer diagnosis.  90% of all patients survive for 5 years.  That's how long the statistics go for.  Of the other 10% there is usually a secondary reason, such as elderly, or in ill health, or possibly a very late diagnosis.  Treatment isn't a walk in the park, but it is doable.  So please don't start planning your funeral just yet, chances are that you will have plenty of time for that much much further down the line!  My aunt was screened early and had breast cancer at age 49, she's still with us at age 75.  I draw comfort from that.  Also if you need a mastectomy, reconstructions are amazing and there is no need to worry about how you might look.  Do ask any questions you might have, as there is no such thing as a sill question.",

Radiotherapy is very wearing, just the to-ing and fro-ing is bad enough, but after all the other sh*t we have to deal with, it's probably the last straw.  Your oncologist should be able to give you statistics for your type of cancer if you really want to know.  Bear in mind, though, that these statistics are already 5 years out of date by their very nature, so it really is a worst case scenario, as treatments are improving all the time.  (If you can't go back to the oncologist, you can do it yourself using the Predict tool - google it - but bear in mind that you won't probably have quite an accurate result as your onco.) It never quite goes away, and the people who expect you to the be same as before are the ones with the problem, not you.  I've decided that I will do what I can when I can and not beat myself up when I can't.  Cancer is one of those illnesses, like depression, where you can't \"see\" the problem, and if someone looks \"normal\" then they are presumed well. We all know differently, so come here and have a whinge anytime!  (Feeling like whinging myself right now!) Helen",

      "Content": "Hi Denise Unfortunately a quick google has come up with this (the last line is the most important) Prepared from the dried leaves of the rooibos plant native to South Africa, rooibos tea has grown popular in western countries because it is rich in antioxidants, especially the polyphenols aspalathin and nothofagin (1), and low in caffeine. It does not contain any catechins, the major flavonoids present in green and black teas (2). In vitro and animal studies have shown that rooibos can modulate immune function (3) (4), exhibit anti-inflammatory effects (5), may prevent oxidative stress and play a role in alleviating symptoms associated with type-2 diabetes (7). Animal studies also suggest that it may prevent chromosomal aberrations (8) and tumor mutagenesis (9) (10). Topically applied rooibos elicits a protective effect against microsomal lipid peroxidation and may help reduce chemical-induced tumor formation (1) (11). Rooibos also appears to protect against damage caused by radiation (12). However, these effects have not been confirmed in humans. Rooibos was shown to inhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme in healthy volunteers (2), which may benefit cardiovascular health. Further research is needed. Because compounds isolated from rooibos leaves demonstrated estrogenic activity (22), patients with hormone-sensitive cancers should use caution before taking rooibos. However it does say that it leads to tumour reduction in mice although not tested in humans.  I would suggest that you limit your intake to a couple of cups a day for now and speak to your oncologist.",

Massive hugs from me  Helen xxxxx",

What you are feeling is, unfortunately, very normal.  The good news is that things do settle down and soften and relax after a few months.  It's still very early days, you have had a major operation! The dip at the top of the implant may need to be filled with some lipofilling (taking fat from somewhere in your body and injecting it elsewhere).  But it's not the end of the world.  However, I am concerned that the new breast is already  bigger than the other one, it may settle, or may not, or you just might have too big an implant.  As to arm movement, please do keep up with the exercise, but that elastic band in your armpit could be axillary web syndrome (AWS) or cording.  Make an appointment with your BCN to get this checked.  If it is, ask for the name of a competent experienced physio and get your GP to do an urgent referral.  Some people do find that massage helps, but the physio \"popped\" mine and it was instant!  Why suffer it any longer than necessary!  You do need someone with experience though.",

That said, I think he's confusing Sandoz with Femara.  Femara is the original patented drug and Sandoz is also made by Novartis and has an almost identical recipe, but should be much cheaper.   I would say give it a go.  The doctor would put Letrozole on your prescription, which means that the pharmacist can give you any brand that they have in (usually the cheapest, but you can get lucky).  Ask around various pharmacists to see what they stock (phone. if you can!) and try each one, noting which side effects you get.  If you find one that suits, ask your doctor to put that brand on the script.  If you can't tolerate any, ask for a trial of Femara.  If that works, then you need to persuade your doctor to prescribe it by name.   And if you really can't tolerate any, go back to your oncologist and see what options there are.  Ultimately, it's your decision, the statistics for you are also important, so find out what yours are (ask the onco) and consider the options.",

      "Content": "So, I went to London and saw the consultant at the Royal Marsden (eventually, but another story!).  Basically he doesn't think much of these so called permanent expander implants, he doesn't use them and although he said looking at these they are a good result for what they are, he doesn't think they are a good long term solution.   And this bears out everything I can find out, as no one on any site I've read about seems to either have them or keep them.   He had a look at my stomach area, and said that I would be a good candidate for the DIEP if I wanted it, although it would be a long op (8-10 hrs), and 2 months recovery time.  This is mainly for the stomach to recover, not the boobs!  But also to take care over the boobs so that they can heal both externally AND internally.  BUT I would only get an A cup possibly a B cup out of the stomach material that I have at the moment.  :(  I really like having these perky boobs, biggest and perkiest they've ever been!  But the rippling is coming back again a bit, so something has to be done. His recommendation is that I have them swapped out for silicone ones, they can adjust them a bit so they're more equal (atm one is slightly to the left, one is more in the middle!), and see how that goes.  If I'm happy with it, then I'm good for another 15 years (longer if I have no problems with the implants), if not, I can still do the DIEP route.  And maybe have lipofilling to supplement a bit.   Anyway, there's no rush to decide, things are OK at the moment, I'm off on holiday in May, so nothing is going to happen before then.  But might have it done after that - the horses are easier to do in the summer, riding is a pain with flies, etc, and the ground gets too hard as well.   But after that?  Will probably have them swapped over.  ;) And another thing that may interest you.  They are not keen on the LD flap as a method of reconstruction.  They're not THAT keen on the TRAM either, but they do some, but he told me that they do less and less of the recons involving muscles.  And get a much better result. So that's something to think about.  ",

Finally, I'm here to tell you that life does improve.  You will have days when you don't even think about cancer anymore, you will enjoy life, join in and forget that anything was ever any different.  Not all day every day, I'm sure, but some days will be better than others.  Your new normal will be OK.

If you let us know whereabouts you are, you may find that there is someone just along the road from you who has been down this journey already and can put your mind at rest.   I notice that you are struggling with the various options open to you - if you post what they are, others can tell you of their experience.  You may be near a Keeping Abreast group whose members share their experiences of reconstruction and meet up for support.  If not, there may be a local support group at your hospital.  Please, don't feel you have to do this by yourself.  People want to help.

      "Content": "Hi Anna I think they feel that trying to use muscle to build breasts is the wrong way to go unless there is no other course of action.  It's not so much that it doesn't give a good result to look at, but that the muscle is just that, and you will always have muscle memory there, which can cause twitching of the boob (!) and that you will also lose strength by moving the muscle around.   The DIEP flap just uses skin and fat tissue from your own body, without involving muscle, therefore there is quicker healing and less invasive surgery than the TRAM flap which uses muscles from the stomach.   I was basically told by the BCN's that people who go for the ops that take longer and have longer recovery time are ultimately MORE pleased with their final results. Bear in mind that how they look is only one part of the equation - how they feel to you is also part of it too, and I personally discounted anything using muscle due to the fact that I want all my strength and also know someone who had LD flap and is still struggling with it 2 years on.   I know that there a no guarantees with any of these options, but I've been told that there will be a lot LESS chance of rippling than I currently have.   I'm still torn between just going for the DIEP and smaller boobs or having silicone implants though!  If I could just put on a bit of weight, I think I could go for it!",

Finally, I'm here to tell you that life does improve.  You will have days when you don't even think about cancer anymore, you will enjoy life, join in and forget that anything was ever any different.  Not all day every day, I'm sure, but some days will be better than others.  Your new normal will be OK.

To answer your questions, you can't really feel the implant as such, and depending which type you have, depends how much you are aware of it.   Because mine are Becker permanent expanders, they are silicone shells with saline centres, so they do feel a little like fluid filled plastic bags IMO.  But, if you have silicone implants, I think you probably don't get this effect. I can now sleep on my tummy though, surrounding tissue isn't affected at all. Can I ask where you are in the country? Helen",

Risk of lymphodema is increased with full clearance and can be difficult to live with, but not living is also an option if the nodes not taken are later found to be cancerous and not removed.  I don't envy you the decision, but at Grade3, I would probably do the above.",

Even though you are stage 1, you need the reassurance from the scan that there is nothing else going on, so whilst there is no point in worrying, as it will just ruin the time between now and then, I know it is easier said than done.  However, breast cancer is very treatable and you have been caught early, so hopefully it's just stress and anxiety that is causing you to be tense, causing the pain. Fingers crossed for you. ",

This doesn't mean that you have secondary cancer though, it's part of the original diagnosis.  The nodes are like little sieves that scoop up cancer cells and it looks as if yours have done their job.  Of course sometimes they can escape the net and that's when it gets a bit more difficult. it's very common to have an MRI as well, this is more of a base line to work from and helps to see how the rest of you is doing.  They aren't pleasant but take a favourite CD or memory stick and ask them to play the music while you are in the machine because they give you headphones as it is quite loud.  Good luck.",

I'm going to give you two pieces of advice that will go against what you have said.  Firstly, do not try to stay strong for your family.  They need to see your weaknesses so that they will know how to support you.  Take all the help offered as and when you need it (and you will).  This is the time to think of you and allow others to help.  This is also a way of helping them cope with your diagnosis as well as helping you. Secondly, strange though it may seem, not talking to your husband will be adding to his stress, because he will (if he has any sensitivity at all!) have realised that you are worried and the fact that you aren't broaching the subject means he can't.  Keep the lines of communications open.  He will probably say stupid things, because you look OK you are OK, and all that stuff, but please. just keep talking.  It's a tough time for families as much as the patient, I often think. Finally, you are doing so well, you will get through this,  I'm sure all the old chemo hands will be along to tell you about that aspect of it.  Good luck with your treatment. Helen x",

      "Content": "Hi Snowys Mum  K2 (Mk7) is the natural form and is needed to be the transport for D3 to the bones, otherwise it goes to other places where it does more harm than good.  Most GPs and Oncologists do not understand the importance of vitamins and minerals in the body and how they interact.  This is where I got my information from If you take Vitamin D3 you also need Vitamin K2! Niki Hussey·Thursday, 14 May 2015 If You Take Vitamin D, You Need K2 This is a really crucial point: If you opt for oral vitamin D, you need to also consume in your food or take supplemental vitamin K2. Vitamin D is a fat soluble prohormone, Vitamin K a fat soluble vitamin. Both need to be consumed with some kind of dietary fat, so take with your fattiest meal of the day. Don't take it before bed as it temporarily pauses the production of melatonin, studies have shown if taken late it decreases REM sleep and the number of hours slept. This is a really crucial point: Vitamin D3 should never be taken alone. Always take a combination Vitamin D3/ Vitamin K2. This is because vitamin D3 improves calcium absorption across the GI tract and vitamin K2 is the cofactor needed to transfer calcium into your bones, and not your arteries. Vitamin D deficiencies lead to SLEEP DISORDERS. And to correct vitamin D-related sleep disorders, you have to be careful about the amount of vitamin D you take and when you take it.Take 1000 IUs of Vitamin D-3 per 25 pounds of body weight, but not more than 10,000 IU\u2019s. Sufficient vitamin D can also help reduce pain and control inflammation, among an assortment of other health benefits. In addition to talking a vitamin D3 liquid emulsion with your evening meal, taking the right dose to raise your Vitamin D (25 OH) levels up to your goal is also important. A few small studies have shown that 2000IU vitamin D3 taken over three months, will raise Vitamin D (25 OH) levels by 20ng/ml. This may be the reason that many doctors prescribe this dose. Clinically, this doesn\u2019t play out. Some people will need a lot more vitamin D to raise their levels over time. If your Vitamin D (25 OH) is 25ng/ml and your goal is 45ng/ml, move to a liquid emulsion, taken with dinner and try a 2000-4000IU dose for six months and then retest. Assess how much your vitamin D level moved during that duration and then work with a licensed health care provider to reassess your dose. Once you reach your desired level, you will likely need 1000-2000IU vitamin D3 a day to maintain these levels. A healthy human body utilizes about 3000-5000 IU of vitamin D per day. ***Too much vitamin D can cause headaches and inflammation in the body. The US Government\u2019s upper intake level (UL) for vitamin D is set at 4,000 IU per day. Other experts disagree, the current consensus states it should be 10,000 IU. (7,8,9) This is the amount your skin would naturally produce from maximum exposure from the sun. (10) An even better way to figure out what your optimal vitamin D levels are, is through testing your body\u2019s responses. \"There are so many people on the vitamin-D-mega-dose bandwagon, taking more and more of vitamin D. And it could absolutely be causing harm if you are lacking the K2 to complete the job to get the calcium where it's supposed to be,\" Rheaume-Bleue warns. \"We don't see symptoms of vitamin D toxicity very often. But when we do, those symptoms are inappropriate calcification. That's the symptom of vitamin D toxicity. And it is actually a lack of vitamin K2 that can cause that...\" While the ideal or optimal ratios between vitamin D and vitamin K2 have yet to be elucidated, Rheume-Bleue suggests about 150-200 micrograms of K2 will meet the need for the \"average\" healthy person. \"My earlier recommendation was not taking into account people who were doing high dose of vitamin D supplementation,\" Rheaume-Bleue says. \"That's where it gets a little bit more technical. It seems that for the average person, around 200 to 280 micrograms will activate your K2 proteins and do a lot of good for your bones and your heart. If you're taking high levels of vitamin D... then I would recommend taking more K2.\" The good news is that vitamin K2 has no toxicity. No toxic effects have ever been demonstrated in the medical literature. \"The reason why K2 doesn't have potential toxic effect is that all vitamin K2 does is activate K2 proteins. It will activate all the K2 proteins it finds. And if they're all activated and you take extra K2, it simply won't do that. That's why we don't see a potential for toxicity the way we do with vitamin A or D,\" she says. Vitamin K2 is an important fat-soluble vitamin that plays critical roles in protecting your heart and brain, and building strong bones. It also plays an important role in cancer protection The biological role of vitamin K2 is to help move calcium into the proper areas in your body, such as your bones and teeth. It also helps remove calcium from areas where it shouldn\u2019t be, such as in your arteries and soft tissues The optimal amounts of vitamin K2 are still under investigation, but it seems likely that 180 to 200 micrograms of vitamin K2 might be enough to activate your body\u2019s K2-dependent proteins to shuttle calcium to the proper areas If you take oral vitamin D (always take only D3), you also need to take vitamin K2. Vitamin K2 deficiency is actually what produces the symptoms of vitamin D toxicity, which includes inappropriate calcification that can lead to hardening of your arteries. Vitamin K is actually a group of fat-soluble vitamins. Of the two main ones, K1 and K2, the one receiving the most attention is K1, which is found in green leafy vegetables and is very easy to get through your diet. This lack of distinction has created a lot of confusion, and it's one of the reasons why vitamin K2 has been overlooked for so long. The three types of vitamin K are: Vitamin K1, or phylloquinone, is found naturally in plants, especially green vegetables; K1 goes directly to your liver and helps you maintain healthy blood clotting Vitamin K2, also called menaquinone, is made by the bacteria that line your gastrointestinal tract; K2 goes straight to your blood vessel walls, bones, and tissues other than your liver Vitamin K3, or menadione, is a synthetic form I do not recommend; it's important to note that toxicity has occurred in infants injected with this synthetic vitamin K3 It also plays a role in removing calcium from areas where it shouldn't be, such as in your arteries and soft tissues. \"K2 is really critical for keeping your bones strong and your arteries clear,\" Rheaume-Bleue says. Now, vitamin K2 can be broken into two additional categories, called: MK-4 (menaquinone-4), a short-chain form of vitamin K2 found in butter, egg yolks, and animal-based foods MK-7 (menaquinone-7), longer-chain forms found in fermented foods. There's a variety of these long-chain forms but the most common one is MK-7. This is the one you'll want to look for in supplements, because in a supplement form, the MK-4 products are actually synthetic. They are not derived from natural food products containing MK-4.The MK-7 \u2013 these long-chain, natural bacterial-derived vitamin K2 \u2013 is from a fermentation process, which offers a number of health advantages: It stays in your body longer, and It has a longer half-life, which means you can just take it once a day in very convenient dosing How Much Vitamin K2 Do You Need? The optimal amounts of vitamin K2 are still under investigation, but it seems likely that 180 to 200 micrograms of vitamin K2 should be enough to activate your body's K2-dependent proteins to shuttle the calcium where it needs to be, and remove it from the places where it shouldn't. \"The most recent clinical trials used around those amounts of K2,\" Rheaume-Bleue says. \"The average person is getting a lot less than that. That's for sure. In the North American diet, you can see as little as maybe 10 percent of that or less. Certainly, not near enough to be able to optimize bone density and improve heart health.\" Hope all this helps in some way!",

      "Content": "hi - if you feel like 20 questions, here goes minus the Beer!  : 1]  It would be reassuring to know how the hospital procedure works just before and after surgery, how long does a single mastectomy take in a straight DCIS [non-invasive] operation, would it be 2, 3 or more hours? They should tell you but it can be between 1.5 and 5 hrs.  Depending if you have any kind of reconstruction could be longer. 2]  With a simple DCIS mastectomy is the underlying muscle cut, I'm still not certain about that? Having had a discectomy years ago, a five hour operation for a fractured lumbar disc, that time after anaesthesia I felt extremely weak, it took a day to just get a little strength back. The underlying muscle shouldn't be cut unless they find it is affected.  You may well feel the same but you just have to go with the flow!   3]  Would I be able to move my left arm at all  [left breast mastectomy]  -  and would there be  need for a bed pan if needed in the first few hours after operation? Yes, you should be able to move your arm although it might get stiffer for a while.  Do the exercises they give you.  If they don't, have a look on here, I'm pretty sure there are some (or on breastcancercare.org).  You might have a bedpan if you aren't feeling up to much, but most probably the nurses will help you to the toilet if you need it. 4] Is there a difference with the initial recovery period depending on age, say in 40's, 50's and 60+ years? Who knows?!  ",

The second operation to remove more nodes is to check that there aren't more of these in your body and remove any that may contain cancer. You don't know until they've had the path report if they have cancer, so they just decide how many they are taking and go from there. Usually chemo would start around 6 weeks after an operation, the fact that you have to wait another 3 weeks for the second op means it should start around mid November, so I'm surprised that it is taking this long - you can ask for a cancellation if you feel you would like to progress things sooner.  No guarantees, of course, there may not be any, or there may be lots on the waiting list ahead of you.

Further to my secretary's email regarding the availability of bisphosphonates, I now enclose a copy of the letter I have received from the Health Minister, Lord O'Shaughnessy. I understand from the Minister that national prescribing arrangements already allow for bisphosphonates to be prescribed for the treatment and prevention of secondary breast cancer. Decisions about the commissioning and funding of bisphosphonates for this use are taken by local clinical commissioning groups which are best placed to know what local need exists.  The Manual for Prescribed Specialised Services 2016/17 makes clear that clinical commissioning groups are responsible for commissioning adjuvant drug treatments, for example, drugs affecting bone metabolism including bisphosphonates. I am, therefore, currently making further enquiries with Bedfordshire Clinical Commissioning Group regarding this. I am also aware that the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence is currently updating its advice to the NHS on the diagnosis and management of early and locally advanced breast cancer and this includes the use of bisphosphonates. I hope this is helpful and I will write to you again once I have received a response from Bedfordshire CCG. Kind regards Alistair Burt",

I have a lot of respect for anyone who has had any kind of treatment whatever their decision subsequently.  And saying someone who chooses a reconstruction has a fake boob feels less than respectful.  It's not their choice to lose a breast, and some people couldn't live with the alternative.  I couldn't, you could.  It's just each to their own.  Information is power, that's all.",

      "Content": "Hi Gail I've been through WLE, further excision and finally mastectomy.  I also had a prophylactic mastectomy on the unaffected side because I never wanted to go through this process again.  I had immediate reconstruction and am now 10 weeks on from the op.  I have to say that it was uncomfortable to start with, but I am getting more used to it and whereas I was conscious of them 100% of the time for quite a while, I now have periods when I forget them entirely.  I've had Becker Expander implants btw, and my surgeon says if I am happy with them they can stay in for life.  The ports will probably be removed under a local anaesthetic, when I am ready.   II've also got family history, and I know that I would still be worrying about the other side if I hadn't had them both removed I wouldn't have been able to relax. That said, it's not an easy road, you will be different, and all the reconstructions have their own advantages and disadvantages.  You haven't said if you're going for reconstruction, but if you are, and you have the option, an immediate recon will save you a lot of problems later on.   Good luck with whatever you decide, and as someone said earlier, you have to do what is right for YOU.

What you could do is let them know you are happy to take a cancellation.  Call the hospital and make sure that it is added to your notes.  Take the Tramadol before bed and make the most of the sleep.  Low dose amytriptylene might help as well.",

I'm going through the genetic testing now mainly for my daughter's sake but also my sister and her children.  My daughter's risk looks high to me, as my husband's side has several incidences.  It's not a painful test (just a blood test) and the thing I always feel is knowledge is power.  If it's negative, you'll find a cloud lift, and if it is positive you will be able to make an informed decision.  As you've already had two instances of cancer, and ovarian and breast cancer are linked in the gene, I'd definitely go for it.  Good luck whatever you decide.

We should all do that, diagnosed or otherwise, but few of us do.  I think we are the lucky ones, because we re-evaluate our lives and decide not to put up with the stuff that doesn't matter, the people who bring us down, and we have a better life as a result!

      "Content": "Hi Karakeys and welcome to the forum.  Firstly you have done a great thing by joining this group at the beginning because lots of us waited until after everything had happened before we joined.  You will get all the support and information you need here. Secondly, the waiting is the pits.  You will find that once you have a defined treatment plan, things start to fall into place.  We all hated this period with a passion and I think being a control freak must be a precursor to breast cancer because we all hate the being out of control bit.  (That's a joke, although maybe there should be a study!).   The good news is that treatment is very doable.  OK, so it's not fun, or pleasant, but it is manageable. There are lots of hints and tips here, and when you are about to have your Chemo, which will probably be in October, keep an eye out for the October Chemo Club thread which will appear around 30th September.   I know that others will come along with their own comments and support but any questions please just fire away.  ",

There is no sensation, however, and if this is important to you, investigate the uplift because I am not sure how much more you would have but it must be more than none.",

Be prepared to have a quick stay in hospital in the next day or two.",

I was told that having implants and then RT would mean a much greater chance of capsulation.  The consultant PS I saw the other day kept asking had I had RT or chemo when he was giving me my options.   At the end of the day, it's an impossible decision.  I have to make one too and I really am in about 12 minds about it!",

      "Content": "Hi Lindsey Anne Firstly take some deep breaths.  And welcome to the group that none of us wanted to join.  The reason we all seem strong is that IF you end up with a cancer diagnosis, it isn't a death sentence.  Breast cancer is definitely the one to get if you are going to have one.  Survival rates are amazing, and the treatments are all doable with various medication and painkillers along the way. There is no point in dwelling on the what ifs. What if I went to the doctor earlier.  What if I die.  What if .... etc etc.  Deal with it one step at a time.  One treatment at a time, if it turns out that's what you need.  You will, if you look, see a post from today from someone who was worried like you and it has turned out to be nothing.  And another from someone's husband.  So there's always the chance that you are the 50/50 that turns out to be nothing.   Also, one thing I like to keep in mind - all the things you worried about that never happened .. they just took up the time when you could be enjoying life and having fun.  Try to remember that! Good luck with your tests, and if you need us we'll be here.",

I liken it to queuing up for the rollercoaster, being pushed on and hating every second.  When you finally get off, you are a bit disorientated, but you do come round.  Good luck for your op, are they offering reconstruction? ",

The good news is that the muscle DOES soften.  I used to be aware of my implants 24/7 when I first had them.  it took about 8 months to make friends with them and about a year later I had permanent tattoo nipples done.  It took me this time to work out whether I was going to have a DIEP flap or not.   Anyway, keep on exercising, don't over do it, though, and you will get there.  ",

It's very hard to know what is the best answer for your mum, because we are all different. But in general, surgery is believed to be the best solution to beating cancer. Surgery is relatively straightforward, and if your mum is in otherwise good health, she should survive it without issue. Obviously if she has memory problems, depending on the severity , that may have a bearing on the decision. Be guided by your mum's medical team and trust them to put her interests first  but be prepared to advocate for her too.",

Wait until everything has settled before you go spending money.   Lipomodelling can be very successful but it tends to be a repeat process as the body will absorb some of the added fat, so you need to top up until you get it right, and of course, if you lose weight, you lose it from there as well as other places.  Implants have a bad reputation, but I'm really pleased with mine.",

I had a double mastectomy with implants because I knew that just having one would always mean that I compared the two, not to mention constantly checking for lumps.   It did take me about months to make friends with mine though.

      "Content": "Hi LittleWren Firstly, welcome to the forum.  We're sorry to see you join, but it will be one of the best things you did.    Getting a diagnosis is always a shock.  Even when you go with a lump, most of them WILL be cysts or fatty lumps, so your brain goes into defensive mode and you hope for the best even if you might suspect the worst.  Keeping busy is the best thing you can do, if you have a free weekend perhaps go and visit your sister and the new baby, or your parents, just so you have things to do.   The good news is that you will get a treatment plan soon and once that starts you will start to feel better.  Try not to dwell on the negative stories that you may have seen, because the truth is, 90% of breast cancer patients are still alive and kicking 5 years after diagnosis (no stats for longer).  The other 10% are generally either late diagnosis, elderly in the first place, or have other health issues.  So please don't waste time thinking dwelling on the negative and focus on the positive.   As to living alone, you may want someone to stay with you for a few days or so after the operation.  You won't want to be lifting heavy shopping or doing the ironing for a few weeks.  If you have a friend who can stay, even overnight, for the first few nights, just to be on the safe side, then that would be great, if your family can't manage at this time. Be assured that this IS doable, whatever the results of the tests, so once you have your treatment plan do come back if you have any more questions.",

If you have the option of DIEP then it is definitely worth considering, even though the recovery does take longer, the results are usually amazing.  Don't think that the implants is an easy option, as that can take considerable getting used to.  ",

I have just completed 33 sessions of radiotherapy, without a mark or skin discoloration. I was blond with very fair skin( maximum factor sun cream all my life) I used the cream twice daily as recommended, washing it off in the shower every morning before the next session, with a 'savon surgras' which appears to be a soap free bar but it is recommended for dry skin and does remove any excess cream. It was stressed by the technicians at my unit that your skin must be clean and creamfree for the actual session. As it worked, I guess they knew what they were talking about. I chatted to other ladies waiting for their treatments. Most had no problems like myself, a couple a very small, light burn on the scar tissue and three ladies who had misunderstood the instructions and creamed before the radiotherapy, burnt badly. Personally, having had a few nasty chemo side effects, I found the radiotherapy, apart from being time consuming when the hospital is nearly an hour from home, cery easy.  If my cancer comes back, I might think twice about having chemo again in the doses I had this time but I wouldn't hesitate to repeat the radiotherapy. Love to all Karen I Unfortunately, Karen, you can only have radiotherapy in the same area once. ",

Unfortunately, if she had had them in 2016, we would probably not be needing to have these conversations, she would have forgotten the side effects and be enjoying her life.   Now being Stage 4, this is the highest stage, and spread to the liver is not good, but chemo can shrink any secondaries and she could well have a good few years left with the right treatment. There are many people who have secondaries living with cancer now, rather than dying from it, but it is time for her to accept conventional treatment and remember that for every side effect there is a medication. Good luck with talking your mother into the treatments, I hope she sees that it is her best hope.",

We're a friendly bunch, and the best thing you could have done is join.  We are here to support you and we have (mostly) been where you are right now. So secondly, breathe.  Even if you have a lump and it turns out to be cancer, you are very unlikely to be planning your funeral.  Breast cancer has a very high success rate (90% of breast cancer patients are still alive and kicking five years after diagnosis - figures are only really available for five years, but the 10 year figure is still good).  If you get a diagnosis, you will get a treatment plan and then things will just flow by themselves.  But we are jumping the gun. There are lots of reasons why you might have these symptoms, and lots of people are sent away with cysts or other issues. So don't jump the gun, stay away from Dr Google, as a lot of the information is out of date or just plain wrong, stick to reputable sites like this, Cancer Research, etc.   Finally, don't catastrophise.  You have got this.

Things I have learned over the last 4 months .... they do soften and as the scar heals (both INSIDE and out) things become easier.  If you have expanders, don't let them put too much fluid into them at a time.  They do kind of \"squeak\" if you move them around, but you know this is something you get used to.  (No one can hear it, you just kinda feel it!)  Mine are rippling again, and I am going to have to either change them for silicone implants, or have smaller breasts with a DIEP.  (Or wait and grow more fat ... ;) ) It does get better, things take time, make the most of being looked after because it won't last :D",

That's just how it works.  Macmillan publish their accounts for anyone to check, so if these figures are incorrect, I apologise, just what I was told by the CEO.  We are ultra sensitive, but the money does go to great causes.  You can apply for funding, grants, visit the Mobile Information Service, read the booklets, I could go on and on.  Sometimes you just have to look away and choose not to be offended.   Tags",

Now this doesn't raise funds, but it does provide a service, and without it we wouldn't be here, many of us, becautse we wouldn't have known of its existence.  But people have to eat, put fuel in their vehicles, wear clothes, etc, and you cannot expect agencies to work for free.   I actually don't have any issue with the amount spent, having witnessed some of it, because I know how committed people who are paid by Macmillan are.  They do a great job, often doing free overtime, because they want to help.   Now I don't really think any further discussion on this will be helpful, everyone has made their point.",

You can't help your emotions, but you do need to keep them on a lead or they'll go wandering off in places you don't need to be right now.  You can't stop any of your family getting cancer, being run over by a bus, or any number of undesirable other outcomes, so please do not start going down that road because that way madness lies. Anaesthetic plays havoc with your system too, and will mess up your emotions for a bit.  It's not you, it's the anaesthetic.   Whinge away here, that's what we're here for, the hugs, the support and sometimes the tough love when needed!",

The number is 0808 808 0000, and they are open Monday to Friday, from 9am to 8pm.  I don't know if you can hold off telling your husband before he gets back, but if you can, face to face is always best.  Facetime is a second best, I suppose.  Anyway, at the consultant appointment, they will have another look at you, probably, and they will give you the results of the biopsies. They will be testing the tumour for stage/grade (which is only confirmed upon surgery), the ER/PR (hormone) status, and the HER2 status. If any of these are positive then you have either hormone treatment, Herceptin (and chemo because Herceptin is only licensed with chemo), and if all are negative (known as triple negative), then chemo is given as there are no other treatments. If your nodes are positive then you may have an axilliary clearance, along with either a wide local excision (WLE) otherwise known as lumpectomy, or a mastectomy. If you are offered a mastectomy, you may be offered reconstruction, either immediate or delayed, depending upon other treatment options.  There is also radiotherapy, which is offered depending on other treatment options.  What you will learn is that no two cancers are exactly the same, and no two treatments, because we are all different, age, health, fitness and other items are all taken into account depending on what is found. I wish you luck, and please know that breast cancer is extremely treatable, you have been found early, it seems, so that is in your favour, and over 90% of us are still alive and kicking 5 years from diagnosis, the only period for which there are statistics.  I was diagnosed 6.5 year ago, and I'm as healthy as the next (fat, inactive) woman!",

No one who hasnt been on it can know how you feel.  It's very selfish of your daughter to make it all about her but as mothers we try to protect our children and perhaps she is used to you being strong for her.  Hopefully once she has come to terms with it she will be a rock for you because you will need all the support you can get along the way.  As far as the actual operation goes, that's the easy part.  You don't say if you are having reconstruction but the recovery depends on that and if so what type.   You don't say where you are in the country but there may be someone local to you here that can reassure you over a coffee or on the phone.   Also of course your husband is scared.  He's helpless at the moment and we all hear the worst when cancer is mentioned. It rreally is the last taboo.  If he would like to chat to another bloke my husband is always happy to reassure guys.  Send a friend request if any of this would help.  I'm near Bedford if that's any where near you.  Helen",

I have hypothyroidism and I know how desperate you can get when you are undermedicated.  Doctors are (mainly) useless with the endocrine system and unless you are diabetic you do have to become your own advocate and learn about the disease.  People on levothyroxine are something like 200 times more likely to contract breast cancer.  Double whammy. On your question, if you need them you cannot have autonomy.  If you don't, then you don't have a problem.  Can you pay someone to help you with a few things until you move? On the question of hypothyroidism, it is worth reading through a few links.  Thyroid UK is a very useful website, as is HealthUnlocked, and the Stop the Thyroid Madness site.  One other thing, letrozole will reduce your oestrogen which is a feel good hormone.  So you may need to think very carefully about how to proceed with the family, because if you are having a down day, shouting at them might just drive them away. You could try some venlaflaxine to see if that helps. Good luck",

Ladies there may have more advice for you, although it tends to be quiet. You can have reconstruction, so you would look pretty much the same.   Hopefully others will pop in with their thoughts as well. Good luck with whatever you decide.",

I had to have further excision and they found cancer on the opposite side of the original mass so it was mastectomy for me.   Fortunately nodes were clear.  If you are concerned, speak to them again, but bear in mind that if you have more nodes removed then you then run the risk of developing lymphodema which is not an easy thing to live with. I would go with the expert view, he's seen you and made a decision that he is happy with, so go with that and trust the chemo and radio to do its job.",

Unfortunately TN is unpredictable, and can pop up unexpectedly.  Focus on the treatment and beating this, not on the things you can't change.   When you say what will be offered, do you mean type of reconstruction, or treatment?  If you are having a reconstruction, you will be assessed for a suitable type for you.  If you have enough extra, you could opt for the DIEP flap operation using your own stomach tissue which supposed to be the best option if it is suitable for you.  Otherwise, you could be offered TRAM (using stomach muscle), LD flap using a muscle from your back, or you could be offered implants.  How long it takes depends on which op you have - obviously the implants are the quickest, LD flap next, TRAM, then DIEP which is a long op, but either way, it won't matter to you, you'll be under the anaesthetic!  The longer the op, the longer the recovery, but the better the result.  It's your call, really. You won't be offered radiotherapy, because you have already had it in one area.  You may well be offered chemo again.   Hope some of this helps, any other questions, please yell out.",

If you are a candidate for a DIEP flap reconstruction (using fat and skin from the stomach), this is considered the \"gold standard\" in recons.  The operation is long, and recovery can take a while, but the results are amazing and lifelike.  Also the Latimus Dorsi flap taking muscle from the back and bringing it to the breast is fairly commonly offered, but is losing favour. The TRAM flap uses the muscles from the stomach but is also losing favour.  This is a possibility where there is insufficient stomach fat, however. If you are anywhere near a Keeping Abreast Group, it's well worth going along even if it's a bit of a drive, because you get to talk to ladies and see the results of their surgery in the flesh.   If you want more information, just shout.",

Why should you be the one doing everything?  They're young, fit and perfectly able to do things to help and perhaps what you need to do is look at what you do around the house, and decide that some of it is unnecessary.   Have a family pow-wow and explain to them all how the Zoladex makes you feel.  Explain also that you don't want to stop taking it because of the risk of recurrence, lay it on the line.  Perhaps they won't be able to help but will say pay for a gardener or an ironing service, whatever will help you.   The time for being strong has gone, now is the time for you to tell it like it is.",

      "Content": "iwannaliveforever mistymoley Hi Lizz Our instincts are an amazing resource, we need to be able to listen to ourselves and take note.  When you get the results of the Oncotype DX test, be very aware of your reaction.  If it's a no to chemo, you will feel relief and be able to move on.  If it's a yes, listen VERY carefully.  Do you go into blind panic?  Does it make you more determined NOT to have it, or do you start to accept that it's for the best.  As you said yourself, only you can make this decision.  As long as you are happy with it, then that is the main thing.   I know you are slightly older than some of us, so this can be a factor, as well as any other health problems that may be exacerbated by the chemo.   I wish you luck and peace with your decision. Your reference to my being slightly older was the first thing that has made me feel like me! The surgeon and oncologist keep going on about my young age and bizarrely I was upset (not very!) when you stated the bleedin' obvious - I'm NOT young anymore. (how young are you, btw?) The pre-cancer me is jealous, but considering how badly I'm handling it at 53 (firmly in denial) , I'd never have coped in my 30s or 40s. Love, and thanks for the reminder of the old me! Love Lizz x Oh fiddlesticks, I think I may have mixed you up with someone else!  I'm 52 and I don't consider 53 old!  But it still applies, we're not spring chickens!  We probably have a good 10-25 years without further problems, and then it's anyone's guess.  Your username says you are a fighter, so perhaps that will help the decision!",

Children are remarkable and you just explain that you need to take some medicines that will make your hair come out but while it does that it is also making you better  You could also try the cold cap which can really help keep your hair if it fits tightly and is cold enough  If you don't go for the cold cap, involve her in choosing a wig or buying scarves  learning to tie them and maybe even getting her to shave your head once it starts to come out  I know that people who have been through this will be along with their tips soon.  Good luck with the treatment. ",

Your gut reaction at this point will tell you if it's right for you. (obviously you don't have to do whatever, it's just to help you decide).  If it were me, I'd probably go for it and get it out of the way. Does that help?  Potentially, funding for \"cosmetic\"  operations could be cut and the option removed. Would you be happy with that? (playing devil's advocate here).

I would only advise anyone against if they were a smoker, simply because you need a good circulatory system for the blood vessels to work properly and do their job. Good luck!",

LOL Anyway I wanted to say that as you are on Letrozole, you could be getting what they term menopausal migraine - triggered by a change in hormone levels.  I've suffered from some horrific migraines in the past few years, due to actual menopause, so imagine it must be worse being on AIs.  I'm not sure about the twanging popping thing, could just be a nerve trapped, but as with all these things, it's always worth getting it checked.  The GP/BCN/Consultant never mind you checking just in case - better safe than sorry, and we that have already been diagnosed are unfortunately more prone to further problems down the line in due course, so anything you can catch at the start has to be better than waiting and seeing.  Good luck.",

I've found that people who have been there understand much more than even the professionals, so coming here is a good place to start.  It looks as though your treatment is starting to work for you, and hopefully you will get away with less invasive surgery, so that's good news.  Give your BCN another call tomorrow afternoon - if you have to leave a message, say you've tried several times.  Make sure you leave your number clearly.   Unfortunately being on Letrozole will make you feel a bit emotional and down probably, so everything seems worse than it is.  You're doing well!!!

When I was diagnosesd I had surgery (3 times), then given tamoxifen for 5 years.  I got worse and worse and in the end I stopped the Tamoxifen.  Decided on quality of life over quantity, if you like.  I now wonder if the Tamoxifen affects the thyroid absorption and although I am officially now post menopausal, as you said, the body still retains some oestrogen, whereas these chemicals wipe it out entirely.   It doesn't take much to knock your thyroid out of whack, so I would look into that as well.  Hope you have a good GP who doesn't just look at your TSH and tell you that it's are normal!",

Other information is likely to be out of date and inaccurate and will,  as you have found,  just frighten you.  Secondly,  none of us know how long we have.  We all go around thinking that we will live for our three score and ten but the good thing about cancer is that it actually makes you live for the moment and make the most of life.   Finally,  you are in the right place. The sscan will show what is going on,  which hopefully is nothing,  and the chemo is there to mop up any stray cells.  And then you will be ready to move on with your new life.  Things you used to stress about won't be important.  Good luck with your appointment  You can do this! ",

GPs are not, unfortunately.  Chemo through a line goes straight into the vein. Using the cannula means there can be leakage and therefore damage as I understand it.  Personally I would wait for the Hickman line or even insist on a port. ",

I had cancer in my right breast and when they said (after two failed ops) that I needed a mastectomy I said, fine, take both.  They said, as you have been told, that they would not remove a healthy breast, and I had a scan to prove it was, but I said that for my mental health, (plus there was a high family risk although subsequently no genetic link) I wanted both done although I did have reconstruction.   I was also concerned that I would constantly be checking the other breast for lumps and eventually they agreed to do it.  Good luck and I hope you achieve your objective.",

As you say, you are relatively new here and so we who have been here a while know and understand that chloecat45 has chosen a different form of treatment. We wouldn't necessarily choose it for ourselves, but we respect Chloe's choices. You jumped in telling her that she was wrong and if she felt bullied at this point, I would have supported her.

When she went to the GP with a lump, she thought that because they'd seen her quickly, that she had aggressive cancer and started to plan her funeral. I was able to reassure her what was normal. And although it was a different hospital, I knew what would be done and how.   We'd discussed the various possibilities and agreed which treatment options she would be happy with.   I hope that you are able to support your sister and that you both benefit from it.  I am sure her daughter will be fine, but get the treatment plan before discussing it, so that you have the answers to the questions she will have.  Good luck to you all.",

I've had a weight problem for years, but have finally managed to lose quite a bit, just by moving more and eating a bit less.  I still eat pretty much everything but have smaller portions, and if I eat too much rubbish I just skip a meal.   The walking is the important thing.  Also I have a fitbit which tells me how many calories I have burned and it's always shockingly few!  We all eat more than we really need.  And of course being told you can't have pudding until you have eaten your main course just means you learn to eat more than you want!   Stop when you are full.  Treat yourself but don't overdo it.  Gentle exercise but often.  ",

      "Content": "Hi Jan and Louise No, not just a scare at all.  All cancer is serious, and should be taken as such, and people saying that are obviously misinformed (and possibly a bit stupid).  *zips mouth before says something really rude* LOL I understand that Grade 1 is the early stage of a cancer.  Cells are starting to mutate into cancer cells rather than the normal cells that they should be.   They are starting to cluster and make small lumps/tubes of cells.  The good news is that as an early form, it shouldn't have spread too far (if at all), and removal should be a much smaller operation.  I presume you've had a WLE?  SNB?   I didn't even find a lump, just had some random sharp pains in my boob.  Turned out to be Grade 1 DCIS with some lobular involvement, but luckily all nodes were clear.  I had WLE, which didn't find clear margins so had a further excision, but then found there was more on the other side, so ended up with a Mx.  By this time I just wanted the boob off anyway, and actually opted for both so as to avoid going through this again.  Originally I was told just WLE followed by RT and Tamoxifen, but having had the Mxs I was told RT wasn't necessary, and the Tamoxifen was offered as a precaution but I was told that if symptoms became too bad then it wouldn't be the end of the world if I came off it.  So far I've not really had much in the way of symptoms that I've noticed, so it's been OK. And don't feel that you have to hold back as second best to patients with higher grade cancers.  You are important, your treatment is important, and you must put yourself first in this.  We women are inclined to hold back and in the case of breast cancer (and treatment) this is definitely a no-no.  You have every right and as much right to proper information as anyone else, the BCN's are there to help everyone regardless of grade.   I had to wait ages for the oncology, but she was very thorough, went through all the permutations and options and scenarios, so don't worry too much about questions, as they'll probably cover everything before you get the chance to ask!  Questions might include what are your chances of recurrence, options for treatment, length of time of treatment, but I'm pretty sure they'll cover all of this anyway. My other tip is take a book to read while you wait - our oncologist is regularly running 2 hrs late ... :) Helen x",

I don't know if you have tried a different brand of Tamoxifen yet, some are definitely worse than others for joint pain, but everyone is different, and what is good for one might not be great for another.  Sandoz (Novartis) is as near to the original Femara as you will get. You can also take some chelated magnesium, which I take before bed in a glass of orange juice - really helps you sleep and good for the joints.  Ask your oncologist if you can take glucosamine too.  (I checked it here but I would always double check.

But sometimes you have to listen when it is telling you to slow down.  Take some time out.  If you can, possibly work part time for a bit.  Grief and cancer both take their toll on the body, and if you don't acknowledge it, you eventually break down.  I would suggest you take up yoga, or try one of the Macmillan courses to help with coping after cancer and the death of a loved one.  All these things are worth doing, if only to make you take time to look at you.   I'm not at all surprised you are exhausted.  It might be worth you visiting your GP and having a few weeks signed off work.  But do take some time for you.   Hugs Helen",

To help you, I had an op when I was 16 which cut right along the whole side of my neck.  It was deep, and I lost sensation right up to my cheek for a while, but it has regenerated and I have 99% normal feeling, so you never know!   I'm ambivalent about the nipple, but frankly I'm not even thinking about it until everything is sorted finally!

A fortnight ago, I had to have a second op  as the margins weren't clear.  Whilst waiting for the results of this, my inner arm became more and more painful and now I have been diagnosed with cording or axillary web syndrome.  Very little information about this, but the main thing I've come up with is to have some form of massage by someone who knows what they are doing.  I'm still waiting for the appointment for this, but it's important to have this done correctly, as doing it incorrectly could cause more problems. Unfortunately the results of the second op have come back that I now need a mastectomy.  I'm trying to get them to do both, as there is a family history, and I can't face having to go through all this again.  It's a hard decision though, and not entirely up to me. Going to have an MRI scan of the normal breast on Monday.   Helen ",

You haven't said what kind of reconstruction you are having but to put your mind at rest, I had a sub total laparascopic (keyhole) hysterectomy which, admittedly, left the ovaries in, but I was riding horses within a week and walking about with no problem in 3 days.  So it shouldn't put you back.  If you are having a DIEP reconstruction, you could ask if it could be done at the same time?  Even if you are having implants, I don't see why it wouldn't be possible to have the surgery done at the same time.  Especially since you already had the Mx, the hard part is already done.  It would save on anaesthetic and theatre time, so it makes sense.  As to how our friends cope, it makes me fume that in the midst of all the crap, we have to worry about how OTHER PEOPLE are coping with OUR diagnosis!!!  This is why I talk about cancer in everyday conversation, making it normal. It's still a taboo, it's as if it's catching!  And to be honest, if they can't deal with it, then that is their problem.  You certainly find out who your friends are on this lovely journey.  I'm sure you are as much of a lovely person now as you were before but your outlook will have changed.  There's no getting away from it. You will find people you didn't think were bothered become great friends, and others you thought you could rely on will melt away.  It's their loss.   Benja - if your thyroid got destroyed you need to be very careful that your B12 is above 75% of the \"normal\" range, not just within in, because you won't be able to convert your levothyroxine to T3 the active hormone, also make sure your ferritin (stored iron), folate (folic acid) and Vitamin D (D3) are all in the top 75% of the ranges for the same reason.  If you want more information on this send me a friend request.

I've never heard that there is back and neck pain without one though!  I could see why there might be (temporarily) with reconstruction, but in the longer term these things balance out.   What sort of reconstruction are you thinking about?  If you need more help, you could look at KeepingAbreast.org which has lots of information and there may be a group near you where ladies meet and show their results of surgery and talk of their own experience.  I know that Macmillan also has information, but personally I found that site more informative.  And there's nothing like personal experience to help make up your mind. Chemo wouldn't affect your reconstruction, although it may be delayed due to poor healing if there are any difficulties in this area.",

As has been said, once you understand the results and your treatment plan, you will start to surface, and things will start to become normal for you. Good luck.",

As to the exercises, they are very important to get back the full range of movement, but if you are in a lot of pain doing them you may have developed cording, which feels like a rope under the skin from the armpit to the thumb (sometimes not all the way).  If you have this you should ask for specialist physio treatment and make sure that the therapist understands about cording.  If you're not sure, there is an excellent video on YouTube here  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhseruhnMUc&feature=related if the link doesn't work, paste it into your browser, or google axilliary cording and lymphodoema. Finally, if you let us know where you are, there may well be one of us that is just up the road from you and can meet up for coffee and a chat.  The only people who will understand how you feel are the people that have been where you are.  There are literally hundreds of us here, so there's bound to be someone, or your local hospital may have a support group - ask your BCN.  I'm in Bedford if that helps.",

You feel fine, you are told you need treatment and then you have to struggle to recover.  The good news is that it does get better.  The bad news is that it can take a while. If you feel tightness down the arm from the armpit to the elbow or wrist then you may have AWS or axillary Web syndrome otherwise known as cording.. You may feel a cord like feeling under the skin. If you have this you really need specialist physio.  Ask your BCN for the name of a specialist physio and get your GP to refer to as an urgent case.   Otherwise do persist with the exercises as they do really help. Go just as far as it hurts and a tiny bit further. If you are due to have rads then you need full movement in the arm to make sure you can get it out of the way of the machine.   Do ask for help whatever the situation. ",

As I had a seroma for awhile my scars have stuck to the chest wall whilst healing. It's ugly & pulls all the time . Has anyone else experienced this please, I thought I'd finished with hospitals for a little while ! Hugs to all the ladies going through worse than me xx Hi Silkpainter Hmmm this is a tricky one.  If you weren't in pain and happy with yourself I would say leave well alone.  However it does sound as though you have issues and I would revisit your onco-plastic surgeon, as he may be able to help.  You could also get a second opinion from another surgeon, as sometimes they have experience that others don't.",

The radiologists see things all the time, and they know that it's rare to have recurrence so quickly so trust your team but do let us know when you find out the options. Your team would biopsy any suspicious area and test to see what would work for it, so it's impossible to second guess it.  Mastectomy isn't necessarily any more effective, it really depends.",

My concern is with what happens regarding the muscles that have been split to hold the implants - do you get normal use back?  Do they contract back to \"normal\"?   I keep going round and round this all in my head and it's spinning quite honestly.",

Glad to hear that your husband is doing well so far.  You haven't said how old he is, which may have a bearing on any future treatments, but I would have thought that his oncologist will take the PD into account when determining his treatment pathway. They may have to involve a PD specialist in the MDT meeting (multi disciplinary team) when they discuss and agree the future treatment, which may mean it takes slightly longer to get on to the next stage, but it is best to be safe than sorry. If you have any more clinical information it may help people to comment.  This may involve stage, node involvement, type of cancer. You may also find our Friends and Family group of help yourself in dealing with the patient. Hugs for you.",

My  boobs don't look bad but they are a lot firmer than I was expecting, and can be painful at times, but I think that's just me, since one of them moves more than it should.  I'm currently contemplating having a DIEP flap procedure.  Good luck with whatever you decide.  Helen x",

If you have reconstruction, you will take longer to recover, but as you are having chemo as well, you can take part of that time as well to recover properly.  You may have been advised to wait until after chemo, so in which case, physically you will be stronger sooner after the op, but then have to think about this later. There is a young women's breast cancer group on Facebook - it's a secret group, so no one can see you there, but you have to ask to join.  Perhaps someone here can invite you if they are on it.",

Men seem to think that they won't worry until they have the \"facts\" whereas if it was them with the issue they'd be all over the internet, researching and planning and worrying about what they'd found on the internet until they were told what their treatment plan is.  Because it is mostly women that get breast cancer, and it is getting more and more prevalent, they need to accept that if it is suspected then there is a good possibility that it will eventually turn to a positive diagnosis.  However, there is a 90% chance of a good outcome of living for 5 or more years from these, with most of the other 10% being either late diagnosis, or elderly (and dying from other causes). So please don't spend time worrying about not being around for your children, at this point that is an extreme outcome, so work on diagnosis-treatment-recovery rather than the alternative.  ",

I suspect she tried too hard not to make a big scar, they made a incision around the nipple, but the cancer was on the side nearest the arm and I think she just didn't get it all and she knew it.  So, I went back to the clinic for results to be told that they needed to take more.  As it happened, with my type of cancer, they actually found more on the other side from the original site and I ended up with a mastectomy, but that was me and you are you.  Sometimes with cancer it seems that every appointment brings more bad news, but after a bit things start to be good news and then more good news until you are off the rollercoaster and back in the theme park.  Good luck, you will be fine, whatever happens.

I said that I wanted a double mastectomy, so I also had to have the psychological assessment and a second opinion, I had an MRI of my breasts and they said that the good one was fine but I have family history and they agreed to a double mastectomy with implants. It was great to wake up with a pair of matching breasts and I have not regretted it. I am slightly bigger but was asked what size I wanted and said the same 36C.  It seems to me that people worry about the fact that implants will need changing. My aunt had a single mastectomy with implant when she was 49, she is now 74 and no one has ever told her she needed it changed. In fact her other breast has shrunk, but that's another story! ",

It could be cording.   If you rest it tomorrow and it doesn't improve, get your BCN to recommend an experienced physio who knows about it.  Your gp will have to refer you, but if you have a name, it shortcuts the system as when the recommendation comes through they will fast track you. After the referral, ring the department about a week later to chase it as it is a priority.  Don't wait the standard 6-8 weeks to be seen.  ",

It's still very early days, and you will find that you have to make friends with your new boob.  And that will take time.  It took me about 8 months to come to terms with mine (I have implants) and was convinced I was going to have them replaced with a DIEP flap but I have now realised that they are OK, and that  if I had them changed, I might well end up with something that didn't look as good.  So it's about managing your expectations.  You don't have a new boob, you have a reconstruction.  It doesn't feel the same as your other one, and it probably doesn't look the same, either, especially at this point.   Having drains in is horrid, but at least while it is in you are not getting a seroma.  That's not fun either.  Don't forget to do your exercises. So you are not alone, and you are definitely not a freak!  Be easy on yourself, and give yourself time to adjust.   Whereabouts in the country are you? Helen",

But the mental trauma of losing your breast, even if you have reconstruction, cannot be underestimated.  Calling it an amputation is much nearer the mark.  I suppose if you have one of the autologous reconstructions using your own tissue then they may feel much more like your old ones (I don't know, because at the moment I've got permanent expander implants).

If you are going to have side effects, it's usually quite quick to show up, that said, persistence may mean that they dissipate over a month or two.   Finally, I think your BCN is wrong, it's not like you stop taking the drug and you go back to square one in a week or two.  My oncologist was happy for me to take a few months' break when things got too much and you do need to know what the statistics are for you. Often oncologists push patients onto the AIs and fail to let them know that the actual benefit is minimal. For example, when asked, my oncologist said that the chance of me surviving 5 years on tamoxifen was 98%, but by not taking it my statistics were 97%. Some people told me that for the extra 1% it was worth it, but for me, after I'd taken it for 2 years, I decided enough was enough.  I hadn't realised how depressed, achy and miserable I had become.  As to working to help your son out of financial trouble is admirable, but don't do this at the expense of your own health. You didn't get him into trouble, so it's not your responsibility to get him out.  Look after yourself first, first rule of first aid. Hope you can find something that works for you.",

This might give you the time you need to decide whether you can live with the results or you want to go down the route of reconstruction. One word of warning though. Although your surgeon may have said \"as many operations as you like\", I am hearing stories about people being denied reconstruction as a \"cosmetic\" procedure on the NHS, apart from the initial operation.  So be very sure that you are going to be happy if you are denied it in the long term.",

      "Content": "Hi Future I suffer from Hypothyroidism and one of the symptoms is brittle nails.  It's worth asking your doctor to do a TSH test - have this done first thing in the morning, by why I mean as soon as the blood clinic opens!  This will show the highest TSH reading, and lead to a more realistic diagnosis. HOWEVER.  I did a quick Google and found this ... Nail issues are a concern for many people. Weak or brittle nails are prone to slow growth, breaking, and peeling. The medical term for this is onychoschizia. There are multiple potential causes of flaky brittle nails ranging from benign to potentially more serious conditions. Weak nails are a very common symptom of menopause due to fluctuations in hormones. During menopause the level of estrogen is lowered. Estrogen is involved in water regulation so lower levels lead to dry flaky nails. The most common cause of brittle nails is actually frequent wetting of the nails through cleaning dishes, washing hands, etc. Brittle nails can also be a sign of vitamin and mineral deficiencies, in particular B complex vitamins such as biotin, calcium, and zinc. It can also be sign of certain medical conditions such as anemia (low blood count), thyroid disorders, and skin disorders such as psoriasis. It is important to see your primary care provider or dermatologist to determine the cause of your brittle flaky nails and discuss the most appropriate treatment. In the meantime protect your nails by wearing protective gloves while washing and cleaning, take a multivitamin, avoid nail polish and remover, avoid prolonged exposure to water such as swimming, and apply a moisturizer to your hands and nails. Now I'm not saying this was from a factually reliable source, it was on a US site, not that there's necessarily anything wrong with that, but it makes sense.  I would definitely have a word with your GP next time you are there.  Unfortunately taking Tamoxifen sucks all the hormones out of your body, but they were there for a reason!  ",

And consequently you may have done a bit more than you should have.  Seromas can be really uncomfortable as well so although there may be clear fluid it could still be that there is some infection in there somewhere because every time the skin is broken there is a risk.  Keep a careful eye on it as three times a week is a lot.  Most people have it once a week or fortnight.  It seems to me that perhaps you should have had a drain left in longer. But I am not medically qualified so this is just my musings..  If oramorphjust makes you sleepy, perhaps gabapentine or amytriptylene might work.  Take them at night as they do make you drowsy but they are for nerve pain so could help if that is what is causing the pain.  Hope some of this helps. You've been through a major op and your body has been pulled about a lot so be kind to yourself.  Helen ",

Certain brands do impact some people more than others although not all brands impact all people in the same way, if that makes sense.

Jazzmyne - If you ask your doctor and explain what you want, they should allow you to do it.  But you may have to convince them.  I had to have a second opinion, and my argument was the same as you - I would worry about it coming back (thus affecting my mental health), I would not be able to relax, family history was strong too.  My other argument (also with a basis in mental health) was that it's really hard to get a matching pair with one natural and one reconstructed breast.  With clothes on, people can't really tell, and for some people this is enough, but it wasn't for me.  Hope this helps, good luck in your journey Helen",

So you could mention it to the team and ask if they have checked it.  I was lucky in a way that I'd moved house and was then in a different health authority, so blame wasn't an issue, but you could say that you are concerned something might have been missed and that others might be at risk?   I'm not sure whether you would be able to get a copy of the mammo or not, that might be trickier.",

As you say, everyone is different, and they have to write ALL the possible side effects on the leaflet, but not everyone gets them. As you may have read on here, there are lots of people that find one brand suits them best, so note which ones you get and if none of them suit, go back to the oncologist and see if you can try something else.   I was on Tamoxifen for around 20 months, but I kept giving myself breaks - I wouldn't take them on holiday for instance.  The difference for me was that my statistics only gave me a 1% improvement if I took them.

Your muscles have been moved, cut and reattached all over the place so it's not surprising that your body needs time to recover.  Definitely do the exercises, and get stronger painkillers if you need them, if only so you can bear to do the exercises.  If you are still struggling when everyone else says you should be getting better, don't be fobbed off, as there can very occasionally be issues with the surgery.

We have all been where you are and understand the fear that you are going through..  As Della has already said,  the nodes are there to catch stray cells,  so that they don't go floating around the body.  I don't know if you have been told whether you will have chemo or radiotherapy, but these are designed to hit any cells not removed by surgery, so you need to stop worrying about spread and trust your team to give you the best possible treatment so that you can get on with life.   Do ask any questions,  there's no such thing as a stupid question and we will do our best to help. ",

But I'm sure you know that HRT is a risk factor for breast cancer. Everything you have said does point to needing further investigation, and your doctor should refer you to the breast clinic for investigation.  If you feel it would help, it might be worth taking your husband with you, as women can often be dismissed as hypochondriacs! I can't believe that I have just typed that in 2017, but there it is. I would start the conversation that you have found a lump and get the doctor to examine it. Protocol should be to refer and do not let them fob you off that you are too young, the fact that you have had a hysterectomy and are on HRT does increase your risk. And there are sadly plenty of young women who have breast cancer here with no risk factors.  If no referral is forthcoming, you must say that you would like to be referred. If you ask and they refuse and are later found to have a problem that could have been sorted earlier, that is negligence so they will do it. One other thing. If you can, get an emergency same day appointment. Although two weeks isn't going to change the outcome, the worry will be added stress that you don't need.  Good luck and do let us know how you get on. ",

Hang on to life though - things definitely do improve with time, and keep a dialogue with your surgeon.",

I have to say that both the doctor and the nurse have behaved very unprofessionally, and I would be making a complaint if I were you. That said, the important thing is that they have sent you for an urgent referral.  Be prepared for things to move very quickly because from your description it sounds as though they suspect cancer and are doing the right things by sending you straight away. Unfortunately small lumps need to be monitored and it seems that this hasn't happened for you.  At least you are being seen now, and hopefully will be put onto a treatment plan as soon as possible, assuming a cancer diagnosis.   Do keep posting and whatever happens, we are here to support you. ",

The radiologist may have seen several similar scans in their work and they do get to know, so the fact is, it's likely to be cancer, but it's not necessarily the end of the world.

I just wanted to say that it's their problem that they can't accept you for who you are and support you through this awful time.  It says a lot about them.  It can be hard to be different, as you have found, but please keep in touch with them because they will one day realise that they are the ones who are missing out on your company.   In the meantime, be with people who understand - both here and perhaps at your local hospital support group?  Possibly spend more time with friends and if they are sparse at the moment, join the local LGBT group in your area.  Life is too short to spend time worrying about people who aren't worried about us.  ",

Firstly, if your daughter does get a cancer diagnosis, you could encourage her to join this forum for support.  As she is deaf, she may well find it easier to \"talk \" here.  Plus the ladies (and the occasional gent) are founts of knowledge and help. Secondly, breast cancer has one of the best survival rates.  She's young,  so in the event that cancer is found, they will likely throw everything at her in terms of treatment.  This is where you can help and your own experience will come in very handyou. Finally, I truly think it is often harder for the family and friends who feel so helpless.  In a way your own experience will make it harder for you because you will know exactly what she is going through but in other ways it will help you do the right thing.   Post away with any questions - someone will have been there and done that!   ",

Ask your oncologist for the statistics for both with and without the hormone therapies.  I do know how you feel, because I am allergic to loads of things.  I would suggest that assuming the statistics say you would have a significant reduction in recurrence with the hormone therapies, that you give them a try.  If you find the side effects too difficult (after trying all the different brands, because many ladies find one that suits them over others) then you can decide whether you want quality of life over quantity.   I was 47 when I was diagnosed, and given tamoxifen after surgery etc.  I decided that the side effects weren't worth the extra 1% protection, but that was a tiny margin.  I would say think what margin you could live with, and if the onco says less then you will know it's the right decision.  ",

The other 10% are usually elderly and die of something else, late diagnosis or have other significant health issues. Don't be a glass 10% empty person, it's easy to wallow and wail and say but what if.  Be the glass 90% full person. You will get through this.

I will tell you that there is no right or wrong, your partner's family may have strong feelings one way or another, but it is your partner that is the important person here.  And you.   Your partner will have had a meeting with the oncologist (at which you may have been present?) and should have been presented with the statistics for or against the chemo, and I'm guessing that she decided that for her, the risks outweighed the benefits.  In my own case, there was no benefit whatsoever, so it was easy for me, but I know that if my OH had some kind of cancer and chemo was offered, I would be wary of pushing him into it if he didn't want it.   That said, it is a miracle drug for some, and has saved many lives.  What it is important for you to do is to make sure that your partner knows you love her, and that you support her in her decision (even if, deep down, you don't agree with it).  Because how would you feel if she was one of the few who reacted really badly, or who, despite the chemo, and having suffered the effects, had a recurrence anyway?   The thing is, we just don't know what will happen.  All statistics by their nature are at least 10 years out of date, treatments have moved on markedly, and breast cancer has the best survival rate of any cancer if caught early.    I think it's often harder to be the partner than the patient, and your partner will know why she decided what she did, but maybe you need her to explain it to you.  Good luck to both of you on this journey.

And in some ways it's worse for the family  than the patient because at least the patient is 'doing' something even it if's just laying there being prodded.  Being friends or family can be heartbreaking, watching your loved ones suffer is never great  You could join the \"Friends and Family\" group where others in the same situation can give you hints and tips on how to cope.   If it is Paget's disease then it is likely she will have her nipple removed.  And if she does this can be reconstructed at a later stage. I didn't have my nipples reconstructed, but I did have 3D tattoos which look pretty realistic from a distance.  And you won't care, anyway, I don't suppose. As to reconstruction itself, there are lots of options, the back one is less popular and in fact most of the muscle ones are falling out of favour unless there are no other options.  If you are (even vaguely) near any of the Keeping Abreast groups then it is worth a trip to one of their meetings where your wife will be able to look at the various reconstructions as the ladies there do a \"show and tell\" and can talk about their experiences.  (Unfortunately men aren't allowed!).  There is no substitute for experience in these circumstances.  I am personally not a fan of the LD flap (the back muscle) reconstruction, because, like you, I know of several people who have had long term problems with it.  That said, I do still think the DIEP reconstruction is a good one, even though I know several ladies have had issues with that.  It's about personal preference at the end of the day, and of course, not all reconstructions are suitable for everyone.",

A lumpectomy isn't necessarily a better option - yes, you have some breast, but it could be disfigured or deformed, will almost certainly be a slightly different size, and you run the risk of recurrence. I appreciate that you are young, but you will be offered reconstruction, so that shouldn't be too much of an issue.  Personally I had lumpectomy, then further excision to get clear margins and then when that didn't work mastectomy.  I opted to have both breasts removed to avoid going through this all in the future.  And I was only Grade I.   Hope this helps",

      "Content": "Julie - I could have written that post a while back.  I wasn't working when diagnosed because we were remodelling our house, but about a year after surgery I got a job (two, actually, both part time).  It really helped me to put things behind me because yes, everyone thought I was OK.  I didn't tell the new jobs that I had had cancer when I applied (one was a temp role, anyway) and it was nice to go somewhere where no one knew.   What I suggest is that you give yourself a little more time to get over things.  Get Xmas out of the way first, put your effort into making it a good occasion, and give your body time to recover from all the bugs.  When you feel good in yourself, that's the time to start to look for that dream job.  Keep half an eye on the job market, but don't stress about it. And if your husband joined the carers group here he could well find some support - if he's not really sure about that, you're welcome to friend me and my husband is actually happy to talk to other guys about it.  Nothing like a couple of blokes commiserating with each other about their miserable wives to make them feel better!  LOL",

I think I was in hospital for about three days but I has to have a blood transfusion which took a while. I went home with two drains  At first they were pretty much like my normal breasts but smaller as they had only put in 100 ml of saline. I had 50 added, then 100. This was a mistake because although at the time it felt fine, it started to ache and I got very depressed. In the end I walked back in to the unit crying and they took 50 out. The relief was instant.  They felt like having two flat round pebbles duct taped to my chest for a few months, but by month 8 I had made friends with them.  It's not an easy option except for the surgeon. If you can have strattice support instead of under the muscles it's a more natural less invasive procedure.  I love mine now! Plus I never have to wear a bra! ",

I bet your son feels very angry, why his nan, why you, and he's lashing out. That's not surprising and very understandable. Do give your son's school a ring and explain your situation in detail.  Just saying you have health problems probably won't cut it, but if you explain you have cancer, and that his nan died not long ago from the same thing, then he might get cut some slack. Don't feel guilty at all, it's not your fault, nothing you could have done would have changed this. His nan most likely had some form of secondaries at diagnosis, since it developed so quickly.   And keep posting here, I know it's a bit of a pain at the moment, but it is improving slowly, hopefully it will get back to a useable functionality soon.",

However, you could go back to your GP and ask them to refer you for a second opinion, you can choose one of the big cancer hospitals, like the Royal Marsden, the Christie, or wherever is more convenient for you, or simply a different surgeon at your own hospital, but I don't think it's good enough that you aren't getting proper treatment, because you deserve to be seen and not suffer.

You get a diagnosis and everything goes downhill for a while. Then when everything is visibly back to normal, everyone, including you, expect life to go back to what it was before. Unfortunately it tends not to quite work that way. The good news is that things do improve. You start to find there are longer and longer periods when you don't even think about cancer. And you definitely don't stress the small stuff as much. You realise that you have been on a hamster wheel and re-evaluate your life. You may find a counsellor helpful. But you will find a new normal. Maybe even an improved one! And remember that if you have a bad day, there's always tomorrow. Helen - class of 2011.",

Here's a big hug for you ... working through treatment, you deserve it!",

Paget's disease of the nipple is very treatable, though, and you have caught it early, so unless you were told it was definitely a mastectomy, it might just be a Wide Local Excision - they will probably remove the nipple, but a new one can be reconstructed easily.   Please try not to let your mind go out of control though - it's so easy to think about the what ifs, but it's not at all helpful.  Instead, write them down and take them to your consultation on Christmas Eve, and make sure that you enjoy the lead up and the actual day.  Good luck for your results.",

So we all understand the petrifying fear that paralyses you on diagnosis.  The good news is,  you are not going to die (well not from this). You are going to have a rough few months, but you will come out with a new outlook on life. As for reconstruction, it is down to the individual., Do your research and bear in mind that you may not be suitable for all options, so don't fixate on a particular type.

If you can't do this, have a word with your BCN and see if she knows of anyone who is willing to do this locally.  There may even be a similar group. Don't just go for what you think is the easy option, there isn't one. Go for the one that will give the best result and fit best with your lifestyle.  Bear in mind that options using muscle to reconstruct will impair the function of those muscles to some degree.   Feel free to shout if I can help, I've been part of Keeping Abreast and seen all types/shapes and sizes of breast reconstruction!",

I was diagnosed with cancer even though there were no physical signs at all, just some odd tingling.  I had to have a mastectomy following a lumpectomy and an op for further margins, but I am here 5 years later and living life to the full.

It explains things in simple language.  I would make sure you know the answers to their questions first, because they will come straight away with some and later with others.  Obviously you can tell them that you don't know and will find out if it's something complicated, but questions are usually quite straightforward. Now the first part of your question.  Welcome to the group.  You have done one of the best possible things you could do by joining us here.  We are all people who have been in your position and we know how that feels.  It's horrid, and if you could skip forward a few weeks, you would, wouldn't you?  Waiting is the pits.  We all felt the same. But the good news is you have a treatment plan, and you know what is going to happen to you.  The other good news is that although it is stage 3, it is still very treatable.  If you have known people who died of this 5 or 10 years ago, the treatments now are much more effective and focussed and you are likely to be in the 90% of people who are a given an all clear in 5 years. The remaining 10% are often elderly on diagnosis (and die of something else, age related), have other health issues, or have been diagnosed too late.  So the future still looks bright, and you will get through it with the help of the ladies (and the odd guy here and there!) on this forum.  Any questions you have just ask, the only silly question is the one you don't ask. ",

      "Content": "Kazzie - it depends!  Is it a permanent expander or a temporary one that they will remove and insert a solid implant into? The permanent ones are more comfortable in the short term than the temporary ones, although I believe that the solid implants are more comfortable long term if that makes sense.  Having them expanded doesn't really hurt, but it's a bit like a brace on your teeth - each time it's expanded, the scar tightens, then softens over time.  The skin is tight, then relaxes, so after a few days it's fine.  If there's any pain, paracetamol will be plenty enough painkiller to deal with it.  It's more discomfort than anything.   Just don't let them put too much in at a time, because I had that and it was miserable.  I had to have some removed eventually, then replaced later on.  100ml is plenty at a time, less is better, and don't rush to have the full amount in.  ",
