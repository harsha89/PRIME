      "Content": "I was diagnosed with breast cancer in Oct 2010. I had an operation to remove the lump and luckily I had caught it very early and it had not spread. As I am in my thirties I was recommended chemo and radiotheraphy, and the treatment finished in April this year. Whilst my check ups are going well, I am starting to feel the emotional side effects of dealing with the disease. These started as pins and needles in my wrist and ankles and I am now having tingling in my head and left eye, which I believe are tension headaches. I have tried a monthly meeting, but feel that I would benefit more from one to one counselling. I have good and bad days and wondered if anyone has experienced similar symptoms and could offer any advice? I automatically fear the worst and seem to lose all common sense. I am usually such a positive person and would like to feel that way again. Ever hopeful.",

      "Content": "People have always said how well I coped with everything but they see the front, whereas my poor husband only gets to see the ups and downs. I do think time is a healer though and have everything crossed that things will get better soon. I think the more we worry about things, the harder they are to overcome. If only I listened to my own advice! I am thinking of going to counselling or maybe a hypnotherapist. Does anyone know any in the bucks area?",
