      "Content": "My goodness, with all these positive vibes who needs power stations! lol Thank you so much to everyone for their hugs and love over the weekend and for sharing all your invaluabe information and advice. Me and Mayte were really touched and we wouldn't have missed it for the world. First we were deflated, then annoyed and angry and then upset. But we are moving onwards and forwards and taking the \"bull by the horns\" as Mayte says and we ain't giving up just cos of this crappy disease. So all chant after me \"Castanualas to Mr C!\" And if you haven't had the pleasure of seeing Mayte's \"Castanualas\" then ask her to show you at Marsha's bash (we need a name for the party) Lots of love to ya all xxxxxx",
