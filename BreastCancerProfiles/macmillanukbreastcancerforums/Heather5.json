      "Content": "Hello everybody.  I am 47 years old and was diagnosed with adenoid cystic carcinoma of the breast on 29th June 2012.   I have had 30 sessions of radiotherapy and two CT scans of my chest as on the first scan they saw small nodules on one of my lungs.  I am a bit confused with the treatment I have had and follow up appointments and wondered if anyone else has had/got this type of cancer.  If so, could you give me any advice on treatment/scans/follow up treatment - it would be very gratefully received Thanks, Heather x",

      "Content": "After having a lumpectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy on 20th June I returned to clinic yesterday (29th June) and was told that it was good news. I didnt have breast cancer but adenoid cystic carcinoma and that  the lymph node was clear.  The surgeon had only seen one other case in the last twenty years and had had to look it up on the computer before seeing me.  He said I will be having a body scan as is normal for his patients and that he will be writing to the radiographer but expects that they will recommend no further treatment.  He also suggested I google this diagnosis when I got home. On returning home I did google it and am very alarmed by what I have found - on cancer research uk site it states that it is a rare form of breast cancer (accounting for only 1% of breast cancers). I have found instances where it has recurred in the same place or in other parts of the body - also secondaries in the lungs.  Also that it is usually treated, mainly with radiotherapy.  Has anyone else had experience of this cancer, especially in their breast.  If anyone has any help or advice for me I would be extremely grateful as I am feeling very frightened and confused and lonely at the moment.
