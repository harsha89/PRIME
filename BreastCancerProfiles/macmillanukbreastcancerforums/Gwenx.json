    "Content": "Hi Judy  I read your post and felt I needed to reply to say you are being brave and strong and not at all selfish quite the opposite.  I also have dependent parents and know how tough it is to leave them in the hands of others sometimes.  However, as my Dads best friend said to me you are not responsible for your parents!   You have clearly made sure that you mum has others around her who love her and can care for her.  Keep taking care of your self and dont let that little voice we girls all share tell you that you are letting anyone down in doing so Gx ",
