    "Content": "Hi Deb Good luck for tomorrow, and let me reassure you - you will be absolutely fine. Seriously, I had a mx at the start of Dec and it was a bit scary going in for it but the docs and nurses are professional and really know what they're doing. I would just maybe listen to some relaxing music on headphones while you are waiting or chat to the people around you. Also, take long slow breaths and imagine yourself out on the beach with your dog, or doing whatever you like doing. Do say to the nurses that you are really worried and they'll probably give you something to calm you down - and don't be afraid to take whatever they give you. I agree that rescue remedy is really good or Kalms (herbal tabs). Good luck, you'll be totally grand xx",
