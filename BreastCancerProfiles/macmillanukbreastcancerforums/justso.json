    "Content": "I had my operation on 30 March to remove a 2cm tumour (grade 3) by wide local excision. I have seen my onc prior to my results for HER2. He does not agree with cold caps beceause of the potential spread to the scalp. The breast care nurse has told me this because when I saw the onc I had not read all the info relating to cold caps and therefore did not mention it to him. I am paranoid about chemo and losing my hair so I would like to use the cold cap. I understand from previous posts that some hospitals are offering it to everyone. Also I have conflicting info on chemo Epi CMF.  Epirubicin I know gives complete hair loss but I have been told that hair will start to regrow when on CMF treatment.  However a friend who has received this treatment assures me that it wont.  Advice please re cold cap particularly anyone who has used a cold cap with Epi CMF.",
