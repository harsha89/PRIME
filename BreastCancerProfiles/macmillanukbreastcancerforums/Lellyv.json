Unfortunately the specialist wasn't so special and added 3 benefits together. The reality is each one cancels out the other.  My decision not to work and concentrate on  getting better was based on the advise I was given. It was a big mistake as the money worries have outweighed the cancer worries. So beware of advice given and double- triple check it.
