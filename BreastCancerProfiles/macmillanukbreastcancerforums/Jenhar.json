    "Content": "Hi After recovery from BC the 1st time( chemo, reconstruction and rads) was just getting my life back together, only to discover the pain I had in my chest that my doc thought was Costochondritis was actually the cancer back in my Sternum and left ribs , next month it was my lungs. Eventually after an Oophorectomy I have just started chemotherapy ...again! The 1st time I went to a small counselling group which was local where we were all at different stages of treatment but able to share our fears and tips of how to cope .This group is no more !! Is there anyone else going through this ???? Like with everyone there is only so much you want to put on Family and friends. Jenhar x",
