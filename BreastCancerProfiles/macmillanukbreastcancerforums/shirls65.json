      "Content": "hi all Had my second op on my breast 11 days ago due to the fact they said there were some pre cancerous cells in the first lot of results . My second lot of results came back all clear I have no lymph nodes affected and  my cancer is grade 3, but initially was told grade 2 on the biopsy. I initially was told I would probably have radiotherapy and tabs for about 5 years but the fact it is now grade 3 there is a chance of chemo also Am still waiting to see oncologist so still uncertain of my treatment (the dreaded waiting game again). The consultant said if I needed chemo would have that first. My question is if I need chemo why would I need radiotherapy also, as I thought that radiotherapy just focused on the area of the cancer . Am confused as the results came back clear   ",

      "Content": "thanks weemaw. Bet its nice seeing light at the end of the tunnel. Update on oncologist I got my dates mixed up . After I got my results from consultant was told I would see the oncologist within 2 weeks so as I got the letter at the end of the first week , I presumed that when it said tues it was the following week Silly me didnt look at the date . I was so annoyed tho having gone to what I thought was finally my appt that I had to wait another 2 weeks . Am still in limbo yet again Went to see one of the breast care nurses who said that treatment usually starts about 6-8 weeks after surgery I explained to her that I was unable to plan anything cos I still dont know if am having chemo . She then said that it would be discussed at the meeting with oncologist. Why do we have to be kept in the dark so long Probably to them it doesnt seem that long but seems a never ending wait for us . At least I have an idea now what to expect . Sorry for rant Just rather be getting it over with and on the road to recovery. Glad you are getting there  ",
