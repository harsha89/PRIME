    "Content": "Hi SFGS29 I went to amazing place called Shepperton Wig Company in Sunbury on Thames so helpful and they have just re-launched expanding into everything that you need to feel pampered too, haven\u2019t been yet but am definitely getting my next wig there too. They do appointment only and it\u2019s easy to park for free.  They do real hair or normal, I went for the fake hair but it\u2019s fabulous, I don\u2019t know how to attach a photo?  Hope this helps.
