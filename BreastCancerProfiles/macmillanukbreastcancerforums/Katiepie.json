      "Content": "Hi all, I have had my planning meeting today and have a start date of May 10 so i guess i will be joining the May group in a few days.  I found the planing session strangely emotional. The Senior Radiographer was very professional and formal and said not to use any creams other than my normal skin care routine. This made me laugh as I don't usually have a skin care routine for my left breast.  There have been a lot of threads on here about creams and I printed off the R1 and R2 info but GP and Radiographer seemed dismissive.  I have got some Aloe Vera Gel from Holland and Barrett. Anything else anyone would suggest?   The feeling of lying in the machine did make me feel emotional but the tatoos made me cry.  The radiographer just kept going - as was probably wise - to get it over and done with.  But I want to have a good sob at that point. Having had a great week and feeling much more like myself I started to feel vulnerable again. Not a good feeling. I am sure by the end of it all I will have got used to it all. Cheers to the next phase and the end is in sight! Chin up. Katiepie ",

I was about to start taking medication but did not start as it was too much mind stuff for me. I think triggered by three babies and then being perimenopausal! Chemo has now confirmed full menopause.  I am focusing on exercise and diet and have started estragen pessaries which are great for v thinning and dryness. Maybe helping a bit with leaking too. I am in wait and see at the moment.  It is bloody depressing to feel like your privates giving up on you.  I think things are a bit better though so I feel hopeful. Katiepie",

I have had herceptin too and will be for 1 year.  I have tended to have SE on days 3-5 and first week there were almost none.  My hair loss has been very slow. And with tactical cutting I have managed with hats but go for a wig fitting tomorrow. I want to try part time work in my 4-6 week break before radio therapy starts.  To all those at the end of chemo Yesterday was weired as I wanted to feel more elated but I still have genetics results to wait for and a CAT scan for a lump in my abdomen which mean I can't celebrate.   I have been off alcohol almost through out. I don't drink much so been easy but thinking I could have the odd glass now. Anyone else managed a drink? Anyone using BC to stop altogether? Finally I feel so tired I really want to get fit. I am not sporty. Anyone else got a fitness plan!",

      "Content": "Dear fellow travellers, I am posting today on day 4 after my final dose of 12 paclitaxol. New side effects this week which are occupying my mind as we are due to go on a family break tomorrow for 4 days with our three kids and I am feeling grim. I realise that no more chemo does not mean I will be SE free... and this is the effects of the recent dose any way. My nails feel bruised... is this the start of something more sinister or will it pass? this is new to me. I feel really bloated and uncomfortable in my abdomen with some mild back ache - saw the doctor yesterday who just seemed to say watch and wait. Tingling in my toes has got worse but is still bearable - just constant. My teeth are aching My mouth feels a bit slimy - is this the start of oral thrush?  Can anyone recommend over the counter medication before I see doctor again on Monday 16th. I have piles :( Has anyone else come to the end of their Paclitaxol and had similar experience? The good thing about Paclitaxol seems to be that SE can be less extreme - the bad thing seems to be that there is very little time to recover between doses. I may need to post this in more general chat as perhaps there is no one else in this group with this experience yet. Katiepie",

I really wouldn't want to advise you one way or the other as I think you have explained really well all the many things you have to consider. What I can say is that when I was faced with a big decision I had to make about my treatment the most helpful thing was to talk it through with my breast care nurse at the hospital. She was so kind and gave me the time to talk to her more than once, face to face. It meant in the end I followed my instinct without no regrets. She was objective and knowledgeable and never rushed me. Good luck. You are doing the right thing. ",

I had to say to my husband - I can't do this by myself, I need your help. - It worked best when I was very specific with what I needed - the trouble is knowing what help you need. Try to write your feelings and needs down somewhere private.

Over 12 weeks treatments I heeded help a few times and texted a group message to ask for  help like pick up and keep for a bit.
