      "Content": "I bought a couple of swimdresses from Bonmarche. They're not mastectomy specific but fit well under the arm and have cups that can have a prosthesis or scrunchie in. Might be worth checking out their selection of swimwear. Have a great holiday and remember to use sun tan lotion. Sue",

      "Content": "Hi NikkiS I had a mastectomy in 2001 at the age of 46, didn't want recon but had remaining breast reduced in 2002  to a comfortable 36C, have been very satisfied and have no regrets. In 2012 and 2014 I felt more lumps above the mastectomy scar which needed more surgery,  BC nurse said it was good I hadn't had recon as wouldn't have felt them so soon. I now have secondaries in my right lung so am having chemo to help with my breathing as I'm producing a lot of fluid which has to be drained. Good luck with your decision, it's your body and your choice. S",

      "Content": "I hate it and wrote to them voicing my concerns and feelings. Eventually I received the following reply from one of their fund raising staff, couldn't be bothered to argue back to be honest, too busy losing my hair due to chemo, 16 years after the first time I went through this.   Thank you for getting in touch and sharing your thoughts on Brave the Shave. I am sorry that you don\u2019t agree with the campaign.   I\u2019d like to wish you the best of luck for your chemotherapy. We always want to provide support, information, or just be here for you if you need us. You can call the Macmillan Support Line free on 0808 808 00 00(Monday to Friday, 9am to 8pm). We also have our Online Community, where you can reach out to others who understand your journey.   Please accept our apologies for the way the campaign has made you feel. Brave the Shave was created in order to raise awareness and vital funds for Macmillan and we do understand the sensitive nature of the campaign.   Brave the Shave began after we found that more and more Macmillan supporters were choosing to shave their head and fundraise for Macmillan each year. We wanted to provide these supporters with a better platform in order to raise money, while sharing their fundraising activity. The majority of people who take part in Brave the Shave have a close connection to cancer, including the ladies in our TV ad. So far this year, we have raised £589,677.00, which is absolutely fantastic.  We do consult with people affected by cancer in developing our campaigns and your comments have definitely reinforced our commitment to carry out a thorough piece of research on Brave the Shave with our Cancer Voice groups to ensure the messaging and tone of voice is appropriate and reflecting real people\u2019s experiences and feelings.   We also, of course, are continually trying to improve and check our communication with this particular ask, across all our fundraising which is why your feedback is so important.   We hope this response has eased some of your concerns, and please do let us know if you have any further comments or queries.   I wish you all the best with your treatment,",

      "Content": "Thank you Jess for replying so we'll. Unfortunately iam definitely against this method of fundraising and have voiced my concerns in many forums. One point which was mentioned by another lady in another forum. You don't see the RNIB asking people to walk around wearing a blindfold to experience how a blind person feels as it's not an appropriate method of fundraising. What an excellent analogy. Sue",
