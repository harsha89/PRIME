      "Content": "Good morning everybody . Concepta here  . In approx 5 hours I will be starting my first of 6 chemo sessions .    Its been a long time coming and  Im  more than ready for it . . .I think .     But I have 1 concern  . Its my Husband .      He seems to have some sort of mental block about this whole cancer thing .      Hes a very private person , doesnt have any friends and seems to be going more and more into himself especially since my diagnoses . His mobility is very poor due to a terrible accident  19 years ago but he could do a lot more for himself than he does but that is largely my fault  . Perhaps I have looked after him too well since his accident  .              He doesnt seem to be able to engage in conversation at all regarding  my illness    .  When I try to discuss it with him I just get replys of yes or  no   .  I have told him umpteen times all about chemo and what it entails  , the side effects dangers etc but he doesnt seem to be taking it in at all  . I have shown him my Sepsis Red card and have told him that he must get me to the hospital ASAP if I become ill .   The final straw came yesterday when he told me that perhaps we could wash our motorhome at the weekend as the weather is due to be good .  I could not beleive what I was hearing and when i explained that it wasnt going to happen he couldnt understand why  .   .  He is good and kind and generous in every way and we will be married 50 years in December   but im finding his attitude at the moment hard to cope with ..   I have  2 wonderful daughters who have given me such support that I will never be able to thank them enough . And a son who rings me to ask if Im ok .    Im just wondering if anybody else has had this happen to them .          Concepta .",

Done the Fecs  ,now got to do the T trucks .... Last Chemo is on the 20 July and i cant wait to ring the Bell .   The only problem is that there is no bell at the Chemo suite that i go to . I have sent a polite email to the Chief Executive at the hospital but as yet have not received even an aknowledgement over 2 weeks later .    I have even offered to pay for the bell myself and i have a very nice handyman who has offered to hang it on the wall for us .. But still nothing ..   But Im not one for giving up and I will pursue this until i get the Bell .   Of course I want it for myself   but I also want it for all the people that will come after me and will want to ring it .    Ive always beleived that a positive attitude is very important in dealing with this horrible illness  and there is nothing more negative than a No reply .  So well done Mr CEO ..  Thats it rant over for tonight but i will keep you all updated on my  quest .   nighty night   Imelda  (AKA  Concepta )",

I wouldnt say no to anything that is going to do me good . . .in the long run .          I had my first Fec on thurs and so far so good   .thank God ..  Feel a little bit queasy first thing in the morning .. . bit like morning sickness actually !          But after about  1 hour it just goes  .         My daughter keeps telling me to stop saying      \" nothing yet \"  when people ask me how I am  . She says it sounds like Im expecting it to happen  ( which I am ) .  So thats how I am now on day 3 .     Anybody out there a late starter or is this the way it is ?         Concepta x x x",

      "Content": "liziX Where you are now is where I was last week . . .waiting to start and fear of the unknown .    Everybody is different and of course youre scared .   The best advice I can offer you is to take it as it comes . Nobody knows in advance how its going to effect them and its very much a case of wait and see .. As somebody has said  be kind to yourself and organise somebody to lend a hand .. This is when the cream rises to the surface where friends are concerned and Im sure you have lots of good ones .    Rest when you need toand sleep is lovely !     As far as the school run is concerned I cant advise . . . Im 71 and never did a school run in my life as walking to school was the norm then .  Look after yoursely and love and hugs and good luck x x x",

I work in a hospital on an acute medical ward and my best  advice to you is Complain complain complain .   I know all about staff shortages etc etc  but none of this is your fault .  You should not be in a ward where people have got diahorrea for heaven's sake . At the very least you should be in a side too  . Threaten to go home unless you are moved even if they have to put you in a broom cupboard . . .make sure they take the groom's out first though     Good luck and loads of hugs X X X .       Imelda K  ",
