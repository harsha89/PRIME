      "Content": "Hi. Interested to read your experience of zoledronic acid effects i have just been googling rheumatoid arthritis due to the joint pain and stiffness, numbness and tingling in hands, swollen painful feet etc I have been suffering for a good couple months since having radiotherapy and then the Z infusion  i have been blaming the anastrozole and given up on the third brand I have tried. But I think it's actually still the ZA causing the pain, flu like symptoms and ridiculous tiredness.  I saw my onc last week who said to give the pills a 3 week break before trying a different type of hormone therapy.  Honestly. I had some pretty awful chemo and some hospital stays, but it was not as bad as this. I felt well between the awful 10 days. I look well now, according to everyone I meet.  But feel shocking.  Any suggestions very welcome please ",

      "Content": "The best bit of advice I was given by my nurse at the first chemo session was to moisturise with oil based products as most of the products are full of water and just don\u2019t combat the damage Chemo does to the skin.  Luckily I already used a fantastic brand of natural and 100% organic oil based face and body products so I was one step ahead. But it seems not all nurses give this valuable advice. And many other products have believed cancer causing ingredients as well as being tested on animals etc.  So I thought I would share this as when I was hospitalised last week several nurses and other patients asked how my skin was still looking so healthy and what the gorgeous fragrance was.  (probably why everyone keeps calling me the \u2018Wellest Ill person around\u2019 too)  The lady next to me was getting through a large tub of E45 a week which is mostly water. Her son was visiting and set about ordering some for her while we spoke.   Other ladies at the \u2018Look Good Feel Better\u2019 session also commented as they too had very sensitive skin that was drying out dreadfully and asked what I used.  There are several available but for information I use INLIGHT which is made locally here in Cornwall by a wonderful Dr Mariano Spiezia.  I use the Firm and Tone body oil or Body Oil with Arnica ( great for all the aches and pains) and Daily face oil every day and top up my face with Deep Moisture balm at night while my face is so flushed and hot from this weeks Tax.  On my mastectomy scar I used the line softener intensive and have in the past too on a collar bone surgery scar which is almost invisible.  I hope this is helpful to anyone struggling with dried out skin.  All the best  Nicki xx",

      "Content": "Hi Lin and other lovely ladies on St David\u2019s Day  I think I may have been kidding myself (nothing new there) that in May I will back out there and cracking on with things I have arranged with friends My T should have completed by end of March, then 3 weeks of radio starts 4 weeks later.  I have arranged to go with a friend to Badminton Horse trials early May, a trade show mid May thinking I would be over all this.  BUt everything keeps getting delayed as my T has been cancelled for three weeks now due to low bloods and then I spent 3 days last week in hospital with an infection and had to have my line out.  So on current plan with no other holdups I will be having Radiotherapy all through May. I\u2019m guessing I won\u2019t be going away for fun weekends during it?! I don\u2019t want to tell my friends that I have to cancel as I feel like I\u2019m giving in to it and also they think I\u2019m Superwoman and have coped incredibly well so far after mastectomy and the first three lots of awful FEC. I go back to work as soon as I can as I have to work to pay the bills.  They don\u2019t understand the cumulative effect of all the treatment and so far I had had delays all the way through so only had two consecutively actually which was rough and I hardly worked that time.  I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to manage actually financially as I\u2019m self employed and on my own with two teenagers.  I\u2019m so tempted to just stop now and try to get on with life again.  I know i have to do what they tell me but my body is doing every thing possible this time to avoid the T and it seems to be for a reason. Crikey we are even snowed in now too so I can\u2019t get to the hospital to make the plan for T next week if I have recovered enough from the infection.  I do believe things happen for a reason and finding it very hard to accept that Docetaxil is the right option. Not sure if I am just being impatient because I should have been nearly through it all by now.  Aaargh.  Nicki xx",

      "Content": "Thank you Lin for your reply  It does help having people to chat to who understand.  I have applied to have my council tax reduced for a few months and seeing if anything else I can get help with.  It doesn\u2019t feel right asking for help as I\u2019m used to earning decent money and having extra to enjoy. I\u2019m living off my tax for last year that I saved so HMRC can wait for the moment even though the cheeky sods are charging me interest!!  It is only temporary though and once they get on again with me I\u2019m sure I will be earning properly again. I have never been short of work before thankfully. Just great timing that my husband and I split a few months before I was diagnosed.  However I\u2019m a tough old bugger so will laugh about it all again soon.  Nicki xx",

      "Content": "Such a beautiful song isn\u2019t it.  I was opposite a lady having a boob job when I had the mastectomy and she was telling me all the other cosmetic procedures she was having but that she shaved her head after having a cancer scare like she was some great hero!!  I was very supportive and smiled and laughed but really wanted to shout at her. Having a cancer scare is NOT the same as being told YOU HAVE CANCER! Having your hair fall out all over the bed isn\u2019t like shaving it off for charity and everyone telling you how brave you are.  But I didn\u2019t - I just smiled and made a joke about it all as I always do.  My cousin and best friend were in the week before me with what turned out to be cysts and I was so relieved that they weren\u2019t anything nasty.  GP and docs all said my concern was nothing to worry about -  just did the biopsy as a precaution and it surprised them all.  So when people say oh I had the same Scare it is quite offensive isn\u2019t it  But of course they do mean well and want to make you feel better   Xx",

      "Content": "Hi Nutmeg I haven\u2019t been on here for a while.  We seem to have the same back story and I also finished 15 lots of Radio last week.  Given Anastrozole to take for the the next 10 years but just can\u2019t bring myself to take them. Feel like my poor body can\u2019t take any more crap being shoved into it.  I have been taking Turmeric for a while pre cancer and it helps with Fibromyalgia pain which hasn\u2019t bothered me too much for a few years now.  However the radio treatment seems to have flared it right up.  Not sure if that but I ended up in A&E all night this week with such severe chest pains they thought I was having a heart attack.  I\u2019m now just staying home and resting to recover from the exhaustion on the Radiotherapy whereas I was trying to fight it and keep going to work /riding the horse etc.  Really frightened me actually.  So when I read the side effects of anastrozole being more joint and bone pain I just can\u2019t induce even more.  Also I\u2019m just growing my hair back and it says expect hair thinning And nausea/sickness Etc etc etc  I know we all want to keep cancer away but I want to do that so I can enjoy life not just exist.  You think after going through the last 10 months of surgery, chemo and radiotherapy you would feel great and I have coped with all of that really well.  But now it feels like it gets worse ??  How have you found taking it so far please? ",

      "Content": "Hi Karebear I have my last T today then scan and prep for the Radio next Friday Not slept much last two nights. Just want to get this last one out of the way. They reduced my dose last time as the first was so awful and it was then more doable.  Awake at stupid o\u2019clock - due to the steroids probably.  They rang the bell and all cheered for someone on their last session last time. Think I may cry if they do that for me today. I haven\u2019t cried at all up to now but it\u2019s an odd feeling knowing it will be finished and moving on the the next bit isn\u2019t it. Quite emotional now. ",
