      "Content": "You may remember I posted a message here about having an event affecting my right eye last Friday which is ok now and this was confirmed by the eye hospital who told me no damage.had showed up in their tests. This afternoon my McMillan nurse rang me to say that since I have had the eye event only last week and have in the past had TIA's [that was some 20 years ago] - they the medical team have now cancelled my Lumpectomy for this Friday and suggested  'I should sort out my health problems first'. Well I have already done that, starting 18 years ago, I'm on medication of daily asprin and blood pressure so what am I supposed to do for something that I cannot control, there is nothing more to be done but to take my prescribed medication which I have done. It was only after my insistence in explaining to my MM nurse that I've already had three general anesthetics under my belt, the first was a five a hour general anesthesia for Discectomy 18 years back,  the second was for a uterine fibroid  removal and the third for my first lumpectomy in 2000 all were under general anesthesia and  now they were refusing to go ahead with the Lumpectomy for DCIS, so do I have to wait until my DCIS becomes invasive and if it did eventually, they would have to operate then at more risk to myself. Having said that my MM nurse went to get advice and came back to tell me I could see another surgeon tomorrow to discuss this with him. I feel I've been brushed off, it has got me real down so I rang the MM support line and was told the they have to treat me even it is means seeing an anesthetist or a surgeon again, it is not surprising the stress is getting to me as at the outset in February I was told I had to have a mastectomy without  even waiting for the second biopsy result which later showed I only needed a lumpectomy. Well I feel a little better for writing out this experience if you wish to read it.                ",

      "Content": "hi guys, hope your lives are running smoothly and healing to wellness has arrived. Today, my lumpectomy surgeon said my latest biopsy result had revealed there was still pre-cancerous cells in situ in the nipple itself and surrounding area that needed an excision of the nipple duct, an area of 25mm and I would need radiotherapy after the surgery. Makes me wish they had taken off the nipple and surrounding area during my lumpectomy three weeks ago as my left breast is still sensitive from recent healing being a little sore in the center. Can I ask what can be expected from a 'nipple duct excision' - will the lympth nodes be biopsied too or will they remove them?  My surgeon said my pre-cancer has not invaded my breast tissue, as far as they can tell from the mammograms. Like a few of you here, I feel I've had my fill of hospitals lately and had hoped today for clearance but it was not to be. A big thank you to all who have responded over the last few months, I do value your support. Diana",

I wonder if you experienced any Lymphoedema or did your execises help to prevent that? Can you tell me also what is the difference between 'remaking' the breast and 'reconstruction'?  It was mentioned to me that I could go for an implant but I need to research this more.

From what I have learned so far the exercises are important to recovery.  You had a 'prosthesis' fitted - would that be an implant?   What kind of painkillers do they give you, I can't take paracetamol, is it codeine? It must have been a relief for you to feel good within a week, that quickly and the future has a positive tone to it again.  With best wishes! diana",

      "Content": "hi - if you feel like 20 questions, here goes minus the Beer!  : 1]  It would be reassuring to know how the hospital procedure works just before and after surgery, how long does a single mastectomy take in a straight DCIS [non-invasive] operation, would it be 2, 3 or more hours? 2]  With a simple DCIS mastectomy is the underlying muscle cut, I'm still not certain about that? Having had a discectomy years ago, a five hour operation for a fractured lumbar disc, that time after anaesthesia I felt extremely weak, it took a day to just get a little strength back. 3]  Would I be able to move my left arm at all  [left breast mastectomy]  -  and would there be  need for a bed pan if needed in the first few hours after operation? 4] Is there a difference with the initial recovery period depending on age, say in 40's, 50's and 60+ years? A 'thank you' -  again to those who kindly answered my earlier post over the weekend.    ",

      "Content": "hi there, although I've now gotten used to the fact that a mastectomy may be necessary for DCIS if my 2nd biopsy, from another area in the same breast, - also shows pre-cancerous cells,  the problem is that I'm not entirely at peace with the surgeon I have been allocated and would much prefer to change to another surgeon who I have known has had longer breast surgical experience and there is a communication with. The surgeon allocated to me is around 30 years old of eastern origin and previously his surgery involved thyroid cancers.  Apart from that, I did not like his condescending manner and officious way of not recognizing my surprise that mastectomy would be my only option and really not caring to listen to what I was asking him, he was more interested in technicalities so it was not possible to communicate with him, he was on a different level altogether making me feel rather insignificant. I am going to find out on Monday with the Macmillan Nurse about this situation, of how I can change surgeons as I don't want this allocated surgeon working on me so, my question is, has anyone else here been in a similar situation and were you able to change your surgeon?  I live in Brighton so anyone in this location might be able to provide info on their mastectomy experience and know of the breast surgeons in Brighton.  I am well  aware that Mr. Yelland has had  long-term breast cancer and cosmetic surgery experience as I have seen him previously on a number of occasions, one for rhinoplasty and found him to be very nice and really easy to talk too and that makes me strongly feel I would like to change over to him for my mastectomy.   I know for certain if I feel ill at ease with a surgeon, ignoring my gut feeling then it will be less than successful for me, but of course not for the surgeon.  ",

So I would like to bring you up to date, I  had my Ductal Lumpectomy surgery at the Princess Royal Hospital in Haywards Heath on the 26th July.  This hospital was fine. nice nurses and the day ward was very clean, also my general anesthetic recovery was quick with no side effects. But today after a bath I changed my dressing the third time since surgery and when I gently reapplied a dressing I suddenly felt a sharp jabbing, like pulsating pain deep within the center of the breast.  It was quite a strong sharp jabbing pain that made me feel sensitive all over that lasted around10 seconds. My Question :   I just read there can be pain from nerve damage after a mastectomy and in my case  Ductal Lumpectomy so I wanted know has anyone else here had breast nerve pain after their Ductal Lumpectomy.surgery and if you did, how long did this nerve pain go on for? Can breast nerve damage last for months or for ever?",
