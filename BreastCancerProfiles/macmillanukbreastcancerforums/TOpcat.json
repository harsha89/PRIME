      "Content": "Hi Kiera, I hope you are feeling somewhat better after reading all the comments. I had a double masectomy in June with expandable implants put in straight away. i remember having people ask me if I knew how I would feel after and all i could think about was how on earth could I????I did however have one awful nightmare soon before but wont go into it here. Needless to say itshook me that much I had abit of a wobble 20 mins before going into the theatre!The only thing I can say is, that it wasnt half as bad as I thought. Neither the pain or what I felt like when I looked down. The pain is not excrutiating, take the pain relief offerred (to me it felt like someone had backed a mini into me and just knocked me slightly). I know everyone is different.When I looked down it was obviously still bandaged but I could see I had a little shape there. I think its personal whether we have expaqnders in or not, but for me it was a releif to have something there. Whatever you feel honey, just let it happen and if you want to be quiet or cry with others then do it. REMEMBER that you are doing this to get rid of that cancer. to keep you here will be worth it! Please try not to panic. It will be ok. We will all be thinking of you and please let us know how you are doing afterwards. big hug x",

      "Content": "I have just read this and my heart goes out to you. i had a double masectomy 5 months ago but had recon straight away.This is only temp and needs to be done again but still, I cant imagine what you are feeling like. I too was a double D and have had back problems also so didnt really want the flap and also didnt have enough fat to do two breasts. They took alot of my skin too and i chose the implant only option using  expanders to stretch the skin and then due to have just the implants alone. they will be smaller but i dont mind. I wonder wether  you could come back to the uk to see what they thought? many surgeons will do some kind of recon straight away. maybe its worth it honey so you can feel better in yourself (there must be little escape)? x",

      "Content": "Our thoughts are with you....... I have had a double mx but no chemo. I cant offer you any advice apart from letting you know that it was not the worst thing ever to go through (evben pain wise). If your cancer is that spread isnt it worth getting through this and getting rid of the cancer. As for feelings of fear and the unknown prior to your surgery, I think we all cope with this differrently. i recall being asked what i thought it would be like and thought what a stupid question! I have never woken up before having had a double mx so how would I know?   The only thing that I can advise is have a little wobble, talk to someone if you can and just allow yourself to come to terms with what you need to do for you and your family to fight this thing.   Be strong.

      "Content": "dear Annie, i am so sorry to hear things are so hard for you at the moment. I agree with the others, the Onc should certtyainly listen to what you are saying and there are NICE guidlines that are in place. My lump was only 4cm but straight away the Onc suggested masectomy (in the end i needed a double). Dont let them fob you off , if its that big and you want it gone then bloodywell make sure they know! Take someone with you if you need but make sure they listen......worse case scenario (depending on where you live0 you could get another onc to do surgery in another hosp. We are all here fighting the same thing honey and please never think any of what you or anyone else writes bothers!   Godluck for tom. Will be thinking of you.......x",

      "Content": "Hi there, i was in quite a similar position as had 4 cm of cancer as as it was on the cusp my Onc did actually offer either but suggested mx. i ended up having a double masectomy and its not that bad. The issues to take into consideration are those ones prevalent to your mums life (Mine was for reasons of it coming back and worry about my small child experiencing it -rad and chemo). What helped is speraking to other women that had had a mx (although I know we all manage this in our individual ways). Maybe if she knew more about what options for mx she was being offerred and whether they would do re construction straight away? Since i had both mine done, I do have what is more likely to be regarded as a matching pair so its wasnt that hard psychologically waking up (as I had expanders in which are due to be replaced soon).     Goodluck to your mum and your family. Support her to do what she feels most happy with but all of it is the unknown at those times and hard. x",
