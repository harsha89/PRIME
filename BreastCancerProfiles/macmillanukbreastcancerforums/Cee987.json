      "Content": "I was looking for a bit of advice, I first discovered a lump in my breast about 18months ago it was a hard painless lump, I was referred to the breast clinic, I was seen initially by a junior Dr who was very good and asked lots of questions he felt the lump, the consultant came in and junior dr showed him where the lump was the consultant felt it and said it was probably a blocked duct or the end of a duct. I accept this, over the last few months I have noticed that the lump has got bigger and I can feel lumps / swelling and pain under my right armpit. I also have been getting a lot of pain in my breast and itchy nipples that are different to usual time of the month pain. So I went to see my GP and they looked up the letter the breast clinic consultant sent to them 18 months ago in the letter he says he couldn't feel anything abnormal, which wasn't the case he clearly said he felt the lump. The gp could feel the lump in right breast and felt lumps/ swelling in right armpit they also felt some lumps in left breast. The gp was fairly sure that it was nothing to worry about but was going to write to breast clinic to see what they recommend. I am now concerned that the Breast clinic will dismiss this again and I would feel unsure as don't feel that the lumps I have, have been looked into. I am not one to complain and don't want to cause the already stretched NHS unnecessary cost for tests etc if it's not needed so guess my question is would it be reasonable for me to ask for a scan, or further tests or should I be confident that it is nothing to worry about. Sorry for the long post and thank you in advance for any advice.",

      "Content": "Thank you for your reply goeash, no I didn't get an ultrasound before, I was rushed out by the consultant. I don't go to the doctors often and don't like to feel like I'm wasting people's time. The gp was great and said I did the right thing coming back in. But I just wasn't sure what to do if the breast clinic don't see me or scan. Think I would be best to push for a scan cause think I will just worry until it's been looked into. ",

Your incredible battles with bc are inspiring and I certainly will let you know how everything goes. I think I was just worried I was being over cautious my Nan and Auntie both had bc that wasn't detected until it was too late so thought I was maybe being paranoid and I know being in my mid 30's means that it is likely to be nothing serious. I will push for test for reassurance and let you know how it goes thank you so much again. ",
