      "Content": "Hi all just wanted to have a moan really,  had surgery last September that all went well, followed by chemo and rads ,that all finished end of May and I'm now on the tamoxifen ,so I was feeling pleased with myself although had lots of pins and needles in my hand and numbness I just put it down to the chemo, but things just got worse and worse so oncologist sent me for an MRI scan ,luckily it showed no further cancer .she then refered me to a orthopaedic doctor who after further tests has revealed its carpel tunnel and also a trigger thumb, he has recomended surgery as now my thumb has stopped working at all, he says as I need two procedures it needs to be done under general anaesthetic , I asked if it had been caused by the chemo but they think it's just coincidense .I cannot believe it after all I've been through ,now facing surgery and then more time off from work and not being able to drive for 2 or 3weeks, also hubby has been stopped driving due to ongoing medical problems ,so looks like taxi and buses for us for a while, have decided to go private for this as I just want it out of the way asap, then hopefully get life back to normal, sorry to whinge but needed to get it off my chest, op now booked for August 15th, love to all Amanda xx",

Love and lots of luck Amanda x",

Came home and both cried our eyes out together. Just really wanted to say maybe think twice before you go to see this film, maybe you will , might be just me who was silly enough to go, love to all Amanda x",

The hot sweats have now been part of my life since I started my chemo, I bought a lady care magnet from boots, cost £30 but it seems to work, I do still get the sweats but they are not as frequent or as bad as they were ,maybe that's something to think about , only got to take the tamoxifen for another 4years and 10 months, chin up girl , we are all in this together , love Amanda xx",

With me it's the same side as my wle ,snb, it started after chemo number 4 , then just when I finished chemo it started to really kick in , it wakes me up and it's so bad my whole hand from my fingers up to my wrist is so numb ,I shake it and it can take over half an hour to get it back then I go back to bed and here we go again, I've been crying with it some nights. I did get to see the oncologist two weeks ago , she said she is not sure what is causing it, so she arranged for me to have a MRI scan of my spine ,neck etc, she said it could be nerve damage caused by the snb,or it could be a trapped nerve in my neck , or it could be the chemo ,so I had the MRI last Sunday and should get the results in two weeks, I know exactly how you feel ,I get hardly any sleep some nights , think we had our diagnosis, op ,and treatment at the same time if I remember rightly, will let you know if I get any positive results , I'm away this weekend to Lanzarote so should get results on my return, hope I get on ok while I'm  away as it's driving me mad, will let you know, hope you get some sleep tonight , love Amanda ",

So when I came home I contacted the chemo unit and explained it all , they said yes that will be ok ,they said as long as the antibiotics are in your blood at least 72 before you have chemo then it's ok. Or did they mean 72hours before the blood test ,I'm not sure now. But keeping fingers and toes crossed really want to get the last one out of the way, has anyone else had antibiotics before chemo ? ,love to all Amanda x",
