I went through my whole cancer journey and my sister didn't even acknowledge the diagnosis. But I'm still here, five years on and grateful for the people around me who did care and enjoying life a stronger person because of it. Good luck, be strong, plenty of hugs and you'll get there.",

There\u2019s nothing more satisfying than crossing the days off and feeling a step close to the end. And also hav8ng something nice t9 look forward to and aim towards.  Good luck x ",

I don't think that would have been anywhere near as good. I was also told the surgeons were the same. Having all the treatment at the same place worked wonders.  Good luck in your decision and your journey! ",

I take Anastrozole and plan to take it for a further 5 years. I feel as happy as I can be knowing I have listened to advice, done all I can. I am still here for my family and we are due to go on holiday, my first one abroad since my diagnosis in 2012.  Good luck in making your choices. ",

I still get hot flushes and I suffer with the joint pain, but it was all worth it to give myself the best chance of the cancer not returning. Good luck with your journey.",

The most important thing to come from it was the other people in the group. We decided as we had gelled so much that we would carry on meeting up once a month for coffee and a chat. We still support one another over 4 years later.  If you get the chance to do one, I thoroughly recommend it.",

Later followed chemo and radiotherapy and a further mastectomy and oophorectomy. In between both mastectomies, I had Zoladex injections to keep ovaries at bay before ooph. Still on Anastrozole but possibly due to change to a different ai as I've now been on Anas for 5 years and I struggle with the side effects. I'm expecting to be on the new ai for another 5 years.  Good luck.",

      "Content": "Hi, Really sorry to hear about your mum but by the sounds of it she's got a daughter who is switched on and ready to help get her through it. Arm yourself with as much knowledge as possible, I found it really helped me, especially in my appointments.  I was 48 when I was diagnosed with lobular cancer , grade 2 ER +ve, HER2 -ve, 8cm, had right sided mastectomy, 6 rounds of chemo, 15 sessions of radio, elective left sided mastectomy and oophorectomy. I now take Anastrozole, can't have tamoxifen. Did have Zoladex injections before ooph, will be on further medication for a further 5 years. It's been 5years since my original diagnosis and although I still suffer side effects, aches and pains mainly, I'm just glad I'm still here with my family.  You asked about the MRI, I also had this early on, to check if the cancer had spread anywhere else. My biopsies, 8 altogether, although painful at the time were useful in to deciding what to do next. Although my original diagnosis was hugely delayed by the hospital, once they realised their mistake, they left no stone unturned. I was kept fully informed every step of the way and I still have their support when I need it. The role of the breast care nurse is very important when you are on this journey.  My surgery certainly wasn't delayed once we knew what we were dealing with. It would have been straight away following test results in late Dec but we decided to have Christmas first with the boys.  I was in hospital a week after my first surgery, then in and out during chemo which brought its own problems. Radiotherapy wasn't a picnic either! My later two operations were done on the same day, and took a while to recover from. I would say, all in all my treatment lasted a year before just going onto medication. Be prepared for the unplanned. Take advantage of hospital-free days when you can.  Good luck , but remember everyone's journey is different. X",
