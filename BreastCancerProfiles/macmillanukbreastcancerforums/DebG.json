      "Content": "Hi Cazza, Awwww I am sending you the biggest hug. This has just happened to my BF. She was diagnosed May 2012 (I was diagnosed Feb 13). She found a text on her partners phone in Feb this year. Whilst this is no consolation to you, the reason I posted is to let you know you are not alone. What is right for her may not be right for you. What you have now are choices about what you do next, my buddy felt powerless, rejected with self esteem plummeting by the second. At 42 she is a stunning, funny gorgeous lass but the bugger took all that away. She confided in her friends and found that whilst they can't mend a broken heart (only time and maybe Morgan's Spiced can do that), we can be there, keep her busy, slate him with bells on, and if she decides to have him back and accept that it's her life and she can live it how she wants, who are we to judge. Right now she doesn't want him back and he is has moved out. She has found that piling pillows down the bed stops it feeling empty and she is slowly embracing having full control of the TV and the fridge. I hope this helps a little, those who love you will listen and offer you the support you need right now. In the mean time eat all the kids Easter eggs and live in your pj's - you are in charge. Huge hugs D xxx",

      "Content": "Hi All I am now nearly 5 weeks post op and today the pain is at it's worst. I thought I would be out and about by now after reading thngs on the net of people who are back at work within a few weeks  (I know I know!). Trips to the GP or hospital leave me exhausted and whilst there is mobility progress the pain is becomong a pain. I saw GP for the 1st time on Monday and had a chat he prescibed Amatriptyline (1 at night) to try and get the nerve damage pain under control. He swapped the straight codiene and paracetamol combo to co-codamol. Started Tamoxifen a week ago. For a lass not used to pills this is a pill jugglng task! Trying not to moan but I haven't even been over the door for anything other than docs & truth is today it is agony! Called my BC nurse last Fri and today hoping she will buzz me back. Sorry for being a wimp   Debs    ",
