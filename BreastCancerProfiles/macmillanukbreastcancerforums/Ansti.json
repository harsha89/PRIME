      "Content": "Hi Flopsyuk, Thanks so much for your reply. I think perhaps I gave the wrong impression that I was going into a mastectomy uninformed about the options or consequences whereas I actually feel that I've been well consulted and given every opportunity to discuss and ask questions. Chemo to shrink the tumour prior to surgery wasn't an good option. It's the uncertainty I'm not coping well with and what's floored me is that I've finally realised that I just won't know what the future holds until the mastectomy's been done and the tumour / lymph nodes analysed. At that point, as you say, there may be more hard decisions to take ... but I guess that's just the nature of the beast. For now though, I'm trying to concentrate on the op next week. Thanks again for your support.",

      "Content": "I was diagnosed 6 weeks ago and so I've spent the last two months having tests and waiting for results - I feel like I've been living in suspended animation. I finally thought I had a clearer idea of that might happen over the next few months after seeing my consultant 10 days ago for the results of yet more biopsies. I came away with the understanding chemo was not really an option to shrink the tumour (38mm) and that after mastectomy the likely treatment would be a course of radiotherapy. I saw a breast care nurse on Wed who took me through what would happen during / after surgery and then we talked about the radiotherapy - likely length of treatment etc - so I finally felt I could start to prepare myself. I've now been completely thrown as during the final pre-surgery appointment with my consultant on Thurs she announced that the decision about further treatment would be taken after the mastectomy and it could be chemo, radiotherapy or both depending on the analysis of the tumour and whether my lymph nodes are involved. Typing this now, it seems obvious and maybe I've only been hearing what I want to hear but from feeling relatively happy two days ago I now feel completely at sea. I'm trying to stay strong for my husband and family but I'm actually dreading the mastectomy and then I'll have another 10 day wait to find out what was found and what the future may bring. This isn't a question - just a chance to offload. And I actually feel a bit better having written it down.",

Yesterday it was the fitting for the post-surgery bra which I didn't anticipate as being a problem but I burst into tears in the fitting room - my first public (sort of) meltdown. But I got through it ... next up it's just the op! Thanks again.",

I'm at the other end of the process having just had a mastectomy and yesterday found out that I have 6 cycles of chemo, then radiotherapy, then ongoing hormone therapy ahead. It all seems a bit daunting so it's great to hear your positive story so soon after you've finished treatment. Walks and naps - it's definitely the way to go! I do hope you and your husband a fantastic evening.",

I'm doing the exercises but find it hard to lift my arm up at the side - I can't get it above shoulder height and it's bloody painful to get it even there! I'm hopeful that things will improve though - in my exercise leaflet it gives six weeks as a benchmark for a return to full mobility so I'm keeping everything crossed. Good luck with your recovery - I hope you start feeling more comfortable soon.",
