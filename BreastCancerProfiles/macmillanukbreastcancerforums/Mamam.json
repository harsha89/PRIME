      "Content": "As you will read from the many posts here, the original size of the tumour often ends up as bigger than what is measured from scans. I was told that this is because mammogram and ultrasound scans are not that good at accurately identifying the size. MRI is more so but not everyone gets an MRI. In fact, it isn't just size that can change, the grade of the tumour can also be revised. It isn't until the path lab has the thing I front of them that they know for sure what they are dealing with.",

Don't know if this is the case, or my logic is just the product of a deranged mind. If anyone has any thoughts? I was the only person on the chemo unit that day who did the cc, so I felt a bit self conscious with the contraption on. My charming sis told me it was a bit odd looking.

I didn't allow myself to feel guilty and saw the events as isolated incidents. I was confident that I wouldn't return to chugging away. I also used electronic ciggies in the first few weeks. I'm a few months down the line and hardly ever think about smoking, even after a really nice restaurant meal and or with a glass of red wine. Something I never thought possible. I truly think the physical withdrawal is only a few days and after that is is just the habit that keeps us hooked.

It sound like you weren't given much info when you got dx (diagnosis) Ring the help line here, they can give you professional support. but more to the point WHERE IS YOUR BREAST CARE NURSE...you should have one and this person should have been at you appointment and offer to see you outside of the consultation so that your questions can be answered and be at the end of a phone... In short, as my BCN kept saying its very much an unfolding story. When you have the op they will take the tissue and from arm pit and study it microscopically. This will give them info on the size, grade and type of cancer ie whether it is receptive to certain hormones or not. So you might hear people saying things like they have er +, which means oestrogen positive ( er cos Americans can't spell oestrogen ) in basic terms this means the cancer is receptive to oestrogen, so if you have this type you are given a drug Tamoxifen, which inhibits oestrogen production.... But as the others have said you don't need to worry about all that now, just get your head round your dx. these types of oral medications come right at the end of treatment. You may well be facing other stages of treatment such as chemotherapy or radiotherapy, but not always, before these tablets need to be discussed....",

I think surgeons have to take into consideration your wishes for asking for mx instead of breast preserving surgery. Many women end up having to have more than one op when having a WLE because of not getting clear margins, and often end up having a mx anyway and this is very traumatic and hard on the old body.. Being fearful of recurrence and wanting to reduce this risk is a valid argument. You may end up in the situation I am and have to wait for healthy one to be sorted at later date. Good luck.",
