    "Content": "Hi there, I was diagnosed in August 2010 and my tumour was larger than 10cm in diameter. The consultant told me they stop measuring after 10cm. The lymph nodes were also affected. Chemo had an immediate effect, and by the end of the six months of chemo, there was no tumour remaining. I opted for a double mastectomy, donating both breasts to cancer research, and the histology showed no cancerous cells at all. It's been five years since my diagnosis, and so far no recurrance. I don't think size of tumour is an issue. It's more about how the tumour responds to treatment, and whether the surgery is successful at removing all affected cells, and radiotherapy zapping the rest.",
