      "Content": "Hi Hawkster I very rarely come on this site now, but was a regular visitor 3 and a half years ago. The ladies on here helped me more than they will ever know and they will do the same for you. I was diagnosed at the age of 37 and like you, for the first couple of weeks I was in shock and thought it meant i was definitley going to die. However, once I went back, found out more and got a treatment plan i started to calm down and decided to kick ass. I was very positive throughout my treatment, but it was more a coping mechanism than anything else. Thats just how i dealt with it, you will find your own way of dealing with it. You dont have to be positive and smiley, some people are, some arent. its whatever suits you. but i must agree, i didnt want to sit around for 9 months and mope, i didnt want to feel like an 'ill' person. and i think it helped me. i had surgery, chemo and radiotherapy and am now on tamoxifen. Depending on your cancer type you may get some, or all or none of these. All of this will become clear in time. Trust in your hospital staff, the treatments are scary, but they work.  i guess i wanted to reach out to you because I, like others on here, recognise your fear, we have all faced it. none of us know what the next few months bring for you, but please believe me - just because you have a cancer does not mean you are going to die. Far from it. The vast majority of people with breast cancer go on to live full and active lives. I work for Macmillan now supporting people and come across women all the time who have had a diagnosis 10+ years ago. i am working full time, excersicing, getting by. keep reaching out to us - the road is long, but we are all here to hold you hand. xx    ",

      "Content": "oh carol - im sorry your so upset. i know its always hard when your diagnosis changes, i know a few of us on here have been through this and it is upsetting but you will get your head round it once it sinks in. but dont be sorry - everyones journey is a personal one and no-ones diagnosis is more or less importnat than anyones elses - we are all in it together, whatever our stages, so dont be sorry . but its really not that bad news! i know its different to what you intially thought, but when you are able to look at it objectively, a stage 1 diagnosis is still a good diagnosis - its very early, has an excellent survival prognosis - i think about 98% survival rate for stage 1. so its really not as bad news as you think, but i know its hard to appreciate that now, but you will. with regards to your treatment now, i know it sounds strange but i think its a good thing you get everything thrown at it - ive just finished my chemo, am then going to have a double mastectomy (my choice - i had a lumpectomy but they didnt get clear margins so i asked for a double mx) and then im going on a trial for radiotherapy (where i may get rads or not, depends if im one of the chose few..) and then 5 years of tamoxifen (just got my prescription for tamox yesterday!) but i see all of these things as a good thing - im only 37, i have a small child and i know in my heart i will be here in 20 years time to see my daughter graduate, or get married. and thats becuase i am having all the treatments and doing everything i can to never have to bother with this again. so if you can, try and see the fact you get everything thrown at you as a good thing - its the same as any illness, if you had another type of illness would you not want the best antibiotics available? with regarsd to your nodes, i cant answer that, but its certainly a question for your consultant. i had a sentinel node biopsy before my lumpectomy which confirmed invasion, and so when i had my lumpectomy they did a full auxillary clearance and took them all out. it turned out i just had the sentinel node affected, but they took them all out as a precaution.but different hospitals vary, some just take a few. with regards to asking for a mastecomy, again, only you can answer that. like i said, i didnt get clear margins so rather than going back in for another lumpectomy, i asked for a double masectomy. they were happy to do it for me and they are happy i am emotionally stable enough to handle it ( obviously that remains to be seen..). in survival terms, there is no diffeence between having a mx and a lumpectomy and rads, its just a personal choice for me, as i cannot cope with having yearly mammograms etc and be checking my breasts for lumps every month, im too anxious for all that, so i would rather not have breasts at all than have to go through that, but that is just me. why dont you have a pad and pencil handy, just leave it out on a table at all times and then any questions that pop into your head you can write them down, and then take them with you to your next appointment. youll be ok chicken, take a deep breath and make yourself a cup of tea x",

      "Content": "hi kelly - i cant comment on docetaxel but i had 6x FEC and had a reduced dose for the last two, due to the fact my blood counts were taking such a pummelling they werent coming up enough and they were threatening to stop the chemo altogether. So i started at FEC 80 and then went down to FEC75 for the last two. i too had concerns about this reduction, but it was explained to me that with chemo they alwasy treat you within certain parameters and margins, and even if you have a reduction it will still be within these 'safe' parameters. they also always start at the top of the dose - the maximum they can give you - and this also allows them to reduce it, but still keep it within the margins of effective treatment. also remember it is the first three or four chemo's that do the most damage to cancer cells, so you have had 4 chemo doses at full dose, which is really good. the good thing was was i did find it a little easier to get over the last two, i felt less fatigued then normal and was able to 'bounce back' quicker. like you i had a little one to look after and this made the weekends after chemo much, much easier. but my bloods still took a pounding and i just about scraped through to get number 6, so im still happy it did its job! hope it makes it easier for you x",

      "Content": "hi tracy - just wanted to say i have suffered from sore hand/arm/veins since fec 1 (im on fec 80 x 6).  it started to hurt the second the chemo went in the very first time and hasnt really stopped hurting! the first time my hand swelled up and looked bruised for a couple of weeks and was very sore, then it was sore from the wrist to the elbow and i can barely straighten my arm. (i can only have my chemo in my right arm due to lymph nodes out in left so its always the same arm and same veins getting used). i tell my chemo nurse about it every time but she doesnt seem too concerned but theres not alot they can do about it. the first time it hurt becuase my veins were cold and therefore contsricted, so it hurt more going in ( it took them about 2 hours to administer the dose the first time). the only recommendation i can give is make sure your hand and arm is really really warm before having your next session - i wear a glove on my right hand all the ay up to when they put the needle in, and carry a hot water bottle on my arm the whole time, and then leave the hot water bottle on my arm the whole time im having the chemo, right up to the very end. this has helped immensley - the drugs now only take about 30 mins to go in and doesnt hurt at all. however, i still have a sore hand and arm, with very dark bulgy veins and some of it feels very hard. i still cannot straighten my arm out either. however it does wear off and i also rub in some voltarol cream when its really sore (it doesnt do much but helps a little) the other thing the nurse offered last time is a cold compress bandage. its a really smelly brown wet plaster that smells of old mans balls. she wraps it round your affected arm after the chemo and then puts a white sleeve over it. its lovely and soothing and helped a great deal with the pain. just make sure you tell your chemo nurse everything about it , they should be able to give you something, but unfortunately i think im just going to have to grin and bear it for the next 3 sessions. x ",

      "Content": "Hiya \u2013 just wanted to say I feel for you. my daughter is much younger (3) and we have struggled to try and make things as normal as possible for her, to minimise any impact, but its so hard. She has, so far, seemed to have taken much of it in her stride but it has manifested itself in strange ways, she has developed a little bit of a stutter and sometimes gets very clingy, and she talks about \u2018wanting to be at home with me all day\u2019. We tried to be as upfront as possible at every stage \u2013 when I had my lumpectomy I showed her my scars, she came with me to get my wig and she sees me at home all the time with no hair. We haven\u2019t spoken about death, although my consultant advised me to reassure her I wasnt going to die. Im not sure shes old enough to really know what it means, so we just focus on the fact that I am fine, and that I will be fine. Luckily chemo so far hasn\u2019t been too bad (touch wood ) I  am about to have FEC number 3, so I have been able to do everything pretty much as normal , play with her, put her to bed, take her out etc. but obviously this could change along the way.   But I will never know in the future how this might affect her \u2013 we were trying for baby number 2 when this all happened, but as I am strongly hormone positive (8/8)and will be on tamoxifen for 5 years, I have been advised not to have any more (im 37) as the oestrogen surge my body would have is not a good idea. So she will never have a brother or sister. She is too young to ask for a brother or sister at the moment, but I know that conversation is coming one day. I think it is so common and understandable for your son to be angry, and to lash out. Children will always lash out at those they are closest to, as they feel secure enough to do this \u2013 they know you will love them regardless, so they feel safe enough to be honest in their feelings. What does your sons school say? Are they supporting you through this? My nephew has anger problems (hes 7) and gets great support and counselling through the school. Also what about your local CAHMS service through the NHS? I know you said you were waiting for counselling through childrens services but CAHMS would also be of help \u2013 again you would have to wait for this, but they can be very good. It will pass, all you can do is give him all the reassurance and cuddles you can (which im sure youre already doing). The upside is he will grow into a very kind and considerate young man, who is aware of the value of his family and how to care for others, which many other young boys do not have. xx           ",

I did take some supplements but was told by the penny brohn centre in bristol to avoid them thene few days before and the few days after chemo, to allow the chemo to work. so i avoided all supplemts until about a week after my dose. this is especially in relation to vitamin c, and especially such a high dose of vitamin c. Vitamin c is one of the vitamins known to reduce the effectiveness of some chemo's, and the emergen c sachets contain 1000 mg of vitamin c, which my chemo nurse told me was too high. not wanting to worry you or anything like that, i just wanted to point it out to you in case. maybe worth checking if you hadnt done already. glad chemo is going well for you so far, long may it continue. x",

They couldnt tell me anything further, just that they needed more images. when i went back they told me there was an area in the nipple they were concerned about and that my mammogram had showed changes from last year. i had about four more images taken and then called me in to have an ultrasound of the area, just to be extra sure. after a very scary 20 minutes it turned out that it was fat necrosis, stemming from my rads and the subsequent breast reduction I had. i have a lot of scar tissue in the area, especially around the nipple, and some of it has started to develop fat necrosis. so that was the change from last year. i also had a clinical exam afterwards, and they have put me back on 6 monthly check ups for the time being, so what i am trying to say is that your team are being SO careful, they do not leave the slighteset thing to chance. this obviously means recalling you when there is the sloghtest thing that looks odd. my case was discussed at MDT twice by three different oncologists, and although at the time it only served to heighten my anxiety, with hindsight i can see that actually it is comforting to know they are paying me that much attention, so nothing will get missed. your team are doing the same, just being really careful. there are so many reasons for a recall, lots and lots of women have them. it could be scar tissue, it could necrosis, it might be that the images didnt come out right - any number of things. i know it is hard not to worry, but the all the chances are that it will be nothing. i always remember my surgeon telling me when i finished my treatment that 'she will see me back at clinic at some point with some weird lump or breast thing, its unaviodable' . well, it took 4 years but she was right - i have had all sorts of weird breast things happen this year, the recall, bruising, red rash - all down to the fat necrosis. i suppose if you think about it it is to be expected - after everything our breasts have been through - surgery, rads, more surgery, it is not unthinkable that we would have ongoing problems. wishing you all the best and lots of hugs, i know its a horrible time, but im sure you will be ok xxx",

I tried to combat this with going to the gym and starting my zumba classess agian, but it was quite hard as im SO unfit, but i will persevere in hoping that it eventually gives me more energy! i have also had lots of aches and pains, really random ones - i had a bit of a sore and achy back a couple of months ago, but then realised it was from pilates! thats now dissappeared but then the other day i had a really painful calf for a few days, like a muscle strain. i thought it was a blood clot for a minute and got the bcn to check me out (it wasnt and it went away the next day).. its hard becuase people dont understand that we still get tired - its like, well chemos over now, so you must be back to normal eh? even my hubby, who has been very good all through chemo, struggles to understand when im just so tired. i think it is pretty normal to feel this way, some say it can be a good year or so before you start to feel anyway 'normal', so be kind to yourself. remember that FEC is pretty strong chemo - it shakes you up, spins you round and drops you back on your feet again - it takes the body a long time to recover. find a balance between taking it easy, and gentle excersice - and i mean gentle, like walking or yoga, (but only when youve finished TAX.). any pain that is severe or lasts longer than a month, or gets progressively worse, get it checked out. lots of love and i hope tax isnt too bad for you - its such a lot to cope with but i know you've got your eyes on the prize - so keep your head up so you can keep seeing it ;)",

I read your other post, and I can symptahise! i am starting to feel aches and pains everywhere and it makes me mega paranoid. i am no expert, but i would be pretty sure its the stress that is making you feel ill. stress does weird things to you, believe me, and will more than likely be the cause of your illness, plus the fact you are not eating or drinking properly. Think what 8 hrs of crying would do to your stress levels! can your breast nurse suggest any counselling, like a maggies centre? we have one in glasgow that does individual support sessions, and i will be taking advantage of  them as the time comes. what is the next stage for you? any idea how long you will have to wait to get your treatment started? i am hopefully pencilled in for my lumpectomy and node clearance next week, i meet with the consultant tomorrow and see if she agrees. i hate going back to the hospital for all these tests and follow up appointments, plus i have to go by myself tomorrow as hubby is on baby duty. however i am going to talk to her about preventative mastectomy, which is soemthing i have been thinking more about. in the meantime, i have been on the internet researching diet and nutrition advice - started eating me walnuts and prunes, drinking pomegranite juice and liver detox tea - what a complete load of nonsense, but it makes me feel better, and my breast pain has disappered since increasing my vitamin c levels. still not coping well with being around babies - when i was at the hospital last week there were so mnay newborn babies i thought my heart would break. it was daughters 3rd birthday party on stayurday and there was a new born baby there - i couldnt even look at her, i had to keep it togther. chin up  - youre a week on from your diagnsosis, a week nearer to being fre of this crap. we'll get through this togther.",

      "Content": "hi there my love - im in exactly the same position as you, i was diagnosed on thursday after waiting a week for my results of my biopsy. i kind of knew it deep down, but had some hope it might be benign. but when the consultant came in clutching breast cancer leaflet i knew hope went out the window! i am 38 (just turned 38 last week) and i have a husband and 3 yr old daughter, so in many ways i have been very blessed in life until now. they are not sure yet what stage mine is at - i have to go back for anotherbiopsy next week to check on the lymph nodes, and then probably lumpectomy, chem and radio. they said the lump is quite small (in fact they struggled to find it on the ultrasound), but think lymph nodes may be affected, so some may have to come out as well. everyone i have spoken to has said if you are young you will probbaly have all the treatments thrown at you. it scared me at first cos i thought it meant it was a really bad cancer, but apprently it doesnt make any difference. this really is the worst bit - i found the lump 3 days before christmas, went straight to docs and she referred my straight away. ever since then i have been incredibly scared and anxious, and i still am. i just want to get on with treatment now, but am probbaly looking at another month before i have my operation. i have read some interesting information that if you have your operation in the second half of your cycle (say day 14-30), after ovulation, it makes a huge difference (something to do with hormones) so i will try to have it scheduled for around the end of feb, but i dont want to waste any time, so we will see. at the moment every ache and pain is 'oh my god, its spreading', but its so bizarre that i feel so well, just with a gammy tit. i am nervous about the treatment and how it will affect me, im trying to keep things as nomal for my daughter.i really really feel for you and we can support each other - it has been great these last couple of days to speak on here, its a source of great comfort. i refuse to even think about dying - i wanted all my life to be a mum so theres no way im going anywhere. my mantra - cancer can fuck off. it is an illness, you will have your treatment, then you put it behind you. thats it. thats the only outcome i will accept. xx",

      "Content": "that is exactly the same as i was told - survival rate for 5 years is 85% .you are in shock now, its completely understandable, but you will feel better as the shock wears off. im feeling better today, better than i have felt in days. i havent been eating or sleeping, but i slept for the first time in days last night, and actually managed to eat a meal! where in the country are you? im in glasgow. are there perhaps any support groups you could look into? i understand when you say about your son, i felt the same, i couldnt even look at my daughetr i felt so sad and sorry for her that this had happened. but i am trying to turn those fears into determination that there is no way i am being taken away from her and she makes me feel better because life still goes on - i have no time to sit around and wallow, my determination to keep things as normal as possible. i think we are lucky that our children are the aged they are, i dont have to sit her down and explain about 'cancer' andshe doesnt need to worry. i'll take each day as it comes and if when treatment starts im a bit poorly, then i'll just tell her that mum is poorly, and the medicine makes her feel abit tired, somehting like that. i completely understand - its horrible being in this limbo, im still waiting to know all the facts and im still scared of what they will find - its almost like i dont want to know anymore, just give me the treatment, id rather not know the stage, or grade etc. but my mind is running riot like you, its normal. but everyone ive spoken to say this is actually the worst time. i have been looking at a good book thats really interesting ' the breast cancer - prevention and recovery guide' by suzannah oliver. she is a breast cancer survivor of 13 years and its all about nutrition and how to best prepare your body for treatment. its really interesting and gives you loads of really good advice about how to change your diet, foods and supplements to use to combat and how to chnage your diet to prevent recurrence. it gives me something to focus on at this time, and im feeling im doing something positive to help myself. just think, this time next year all this will be over and you will be well on your way to recovery - next xmas you will be there with your son, enjoying it just as before. just change that picture in your head into a positive one. it will give you something positive to keep you going. and i just think everyday i wake up - one day closer to being rid of this nonsense. repeat after me - cancer will will not have my tears. cancer can fuck off xx",

      "Content": "I completely understand what you\u2019re saying. I just cant think about it too much. If I think about it I will go under and I cant allow that to happen. I think its more difficult that I don\u2019t know anything about my cancer yet \u2013 I don\u2019t know that stage, grade (although its somewhere between a 1 and 2 they think \u2013 really feckin helpful)so my mind works overtime For me, being with my daughter calms me down and gives me a sense of normality. She takes my mind off everything, especially at weekends when I am so busy I don\u2019t have a minute to think about cancer, and long may that continue. Yes, I sit and look at her sleeping at night but it doesn\u2019t make me sad, it makes me determined. I know I am going to be there for her 13th birthday, and 23rd birthday and onwards. I have a very calm feeling that everything will be ok, I really do. The party was difficult, but only because my friends that were there were being weird with me ( no-one else at the party knew). They were being really nice, but there was this elephant in the room, like they were afraid I would collapse if they spoke to me, when all I want if for them to treat me as normal. It was the same with work, before they realised I was the same person, still wanted to have a laugh, they started to relax.    You have to start taking care of yourself. I started looking into nutrition etc because it gives me a sense of control, and physically makes me feel better. You need to start looking after yourself physically and mentally, to prepare yourself for operations, treatments etc. I have read so much and been given lots of advice on this site by people going through chemo about supplements and things to help with the side effects, it makes me feel less scared. Bit by bit, step by step you will start to regain control, I found it difficult to eat or make a meal, but then I thought well, I need to eat my broccoli and my spinach tonight, so I need to eat, even if that\u2019s all I eat. With regards to recurrence, I always wondered to how you would cope in the years to come, but I have read so many stories and spoke to so many people about the fact over time, the worry becomes less and less, that I know it can be done. It makes me so sad when you say that all the laughter and dancing and singing has stopped \u2013 I do understand it but no-ones died! You\u2019ve got something wrong with you but youll have your treatment and then youll put it behind you! Youre wasting time and memories on feeding this cancer with your tears \u2013 you need to start giving it the finger a bit more! As ive said, my main aim is to keep things as normal for a s long as possible, so that means birthday parties, soft play, swimming etc. yes its hard sometime, but in the long run it really does help. It helps me not to feel so much like my life has been turned upside down. My gp said to me that whenever a have a negative thought, replace it immediately with a positive one. And you know that really works. If I feel for a minute, I wont see my daughter grow up, I immediately replace it with, oh yes I bloody well will. And then I think if a lovely holiday to have next year when its all over, or how excellent xmas will be this year cos this will all be over and we can really celebrate. I know its hard, but the more you do it the more it becomes habit. I know what youre saying about maggies \u2013 what you want is for someone to tell you this was all a mistake. But they cant. But I had counselling a few years ago for health anxiety (oh, the irony) and it really helped. It gives you that place to turn. I would urge you to have a think about it. We will get through this together. Im shitting myself about tomorrow , as I know some nodes are affected and then they will probably want to do a scan or xrays or something to check for further spread. I just want this part over with and get on with the treatment. I got some diazepam from the gp but it didn\u2019t really do anything \u2013 maybe I need to take somemore\u2026! I know youre still in shock and its only natural, but you have to start taking care of yourself \u2013 you have to keep physically strong for the months ahead. And have a sing and dance with your boy \u2013 its hard at first, but it will make you feel so much better and more determined. THAT\u2019S AN ORDER, SOLDIER!!!",

      "Content": "dont worry too much annie - a cold/infection wont neccesarily bother your bloods or delay your chemo unless it was really bad and you were very poorly. i have been on antibiotics constantly throughout chemo and thats not been a problem, its been my wbc and neuts that have been low - it usually takes 1-2 more weeks more than usual for them to come back up, which just means it takes twice as long! i should be finised my chemo by now but i have only just had number 5. dont know if ill manage number 6, have to wait and see. dont worry too much about delaying or cancelling chemo - my chemo is adjuvant (ive already had my surgery) and classed as 'preventative' so they werent too bothered about me only having 4 sessions. but the dr told me if it was essential for me to have it (such as to shrink a lump) they would find a way to give it to me. one other thing i was going to mention with regards to all supplements you decide to take - before i started i spoke to the penny brohn centre - you can find their very good website and helpline number online. they have fantastic info about nurition and supplements and i spoke to a very helpful women on teir helpline who told me you should stop taking all vitamins and supplements a couple of days before and for a couple of days after your chemo. so for example, i get my chemo on a wednesday, so i stop taking all my supplements on the sunday night and start taking them again on the following sunday (after ive had my chemo). its just to give your body a quick break from the supplements to give the chemo 'unalderated access' to your body and let it do its magic, then you can start building your body back up again. hope that makes sense - give the penny brohn centre a call for further advice. xx",

This worked fantastically and really helped with the pain. im not sure how it works, but its like a wet bandage that sticks to your skin, and then they give you a cover to put over it. you leave it on for 24 hours and i i had no pain when i was wearing it. then they gave me some to take home so i could whack it on whenever it felt sore. the only downside is it really stinks - like wet cement! ive just looked in my cupboard and the one i had was called 'zinc paste and ichthanmol bandage'. make sure you mention your sore veins when you go for your next chemo and perhaps ask if you can get something to help.  ",

It really is good news. Im glad youre feeling positive and so you should \u2013 its important to try and keep positive as much as you can, it helps a great deal. The main thing to remember is it\u2019s a treatable disease and youre being treated \u2013 it all comes down to that at the end of day. Chemo should give you really good results and get you well on the way to recovery. Chemo will be over before you know it and I know everyone says it but it is do-able \u2013 I have a young daughter (3.5 years old) plus a very supportive husband but that\u2019s about it \u2013 the family and friends we have up here in Scotland have all just about deserted us and we get no help, but its still been ok and copable, even in the days after chemo.   Like the others said \u2013 we are all here with you, right along side you to see you through this.",

      "Content": "Just wanted to pose a conundrum to you lovely ladies to ask your opinion, especially those that perhaps manage people or recruit people.. Very quickly, I have 2 more chemos left, so hopefully will be finished at the end of june. I will then be having a double mx, hopefully sometime around sept. then once I have recovered from that I will be having 3 weeks of rads. So I probably wont be finished active treatment until about November. I am currently employed and although they are all lovely and have been very supportive, it s a very boring job that doesn\u2019t stimulate me. I often go for days without having anything meaningful to do and its been a big step down for me. I was job hunting for something else when all this cancer nonsense kicked off, so obviously its all taken a back seat. However, I have seen an ideal job being advertised in a school not far from me. Its more money and a managerial job, which would be much more interesting, stimulating and busy. It would be due to start at the beginning of next term (september) The question is  - do I apply for it or forget about it? Obviously I would have to disclose the cancer and the fact I would still be having treatment. At first I thought, theres no way I can apply for it, id still be knackered from all the treatment and they wouldn\u2019t want me anyway once they know about the old c. But its such a good job, ideal for me and I know I could do a good job \u2013 these manager jobs in a school don\u2019t come along very often, and I am loathed to just let it go.    What do you think? Should I bother or just forget about it? Do you think that the further surgery and rads would have such an impact on me id be unable to start a new job and all that that entails? I have been able to work during chemo, albeit half days, because it has been quite tiring. If you were a manager and you were recruiting and someone came in with my story, would you even think about it? Am I crazy to even consider it?",

At the moment i dont know anything abouyt my cancer type - hormone receptive, whatever, no-one has told me anything yet. i am now starting to think of just having both breasts removed, either now or further down the line. i think in myself i would feel happier knowing they were both gone, and reduing my risk or recurrence even further. hubby is in support, if thats what i want to do. i will speak to the consultant about it tomorrow more, but would love opinions from those more experienced than myself. my bcn said i would need to go for counselling first.  ",

They run workshops, support groups, yoga, massage etc and provide fanatastic support. They will also do you a nutritional plan, help with healthy eating and excercise, tailor made for you. I have been in touch with them over the phone ( too far for me to travel unfortuantely) and they were so helpful, giving me leaflets, advice and sending me info. If i lived near bristol i would be down there like a shot - i think several famous people have used their services, i know hayley mills credits them with helping her through her breast cancer treatment. here is the website link - http://www.pennybrohncancercare.org/ Anna x  ",

      "Content": "Hi flower \u2013 have been thinking about you as I knew you were due to start chemo. Im also on fec x 6, and hopefully am due to have number 3 this week (possibility it might be delayed as I have had a horrid cold and am on antibiotics). I had exactly the same experience as you with my first as they didn\u2019t give me strong enough anti sickness meds \u2013 I was sick as a dog for the first 24 hours but finally managed to find something that worked. But felt awful for the few days after it, but then picked up quite quickly. My second was much better \u2013 hospital gave me stronger meds and I had no sickness at all, not even much nausea.  Felt tired again but that is mainly due to the meds, they make me really tired. But after a week had passed I felt like my old self again. I got a nasty cold this time round though (had been in contact with a friends baby who had a cold and thought I would be ok..silly me). But emotionally I really struggled the second time round. Like you said, its like it really hit me, that coupled with my hair loss was hard. It also seemed like such a big hill to climb \u2013 it was only number two, 4 more to go through, and I felt very much alone. But I have been to the doctor and got some anti-depressants \u2013 I haven\u2019t started taking them yet but have them at home in case things get worse. I feel like im constantly picking myself up over and over again. BUT \u2013 here I am at number 3, half way there, not quite light at the end of tunnel yet, but not far off it. I know you go on the breast cancer care site as well sometimes, and I have found that if you read the \u2018milestones and anniversaries\u2019 thread, it is such a pick me up \u2013 it is all posts of women who are 5 \u2013 10 years past diagnosis with no recurrence, and it gives me such hope that I will also be in the same position in 5 years time. I would also recommend something else to help you during chemo \u2013 it\u2019s a honey called \u2018lifemel\u2019. You have a teaspoon of it every morning and evening and it is supposed to help to raise your white blood cells back up and boost your immune system, as well as help you feel generally better during chemo. Has had lots of positive reports from people who have used it. Its not cheap - £37 a jar and a jar lasts about a month, but ive used it twice now and my blood counts have been really good. It might be a load of old hokum and a placebo, but it works for me. You will get through it mate. I have had to dig deep this month to find strength, but time goes really quickly and the only way I can be positive is that chemo is a good thing \u2013 I want it, its going to protect me for years, so I try and look forward to every session, rather than be scared. Im always here if you want a chat xx   ",

The one thing I would say is that if you are having neck pain it may be this that is cuasing the headaches. All your neck muscles are connected like a big elastic band to your head, and so often if we feel a headache it is often caused by tight muscles in the neck, having a knock on effect on the head.  I have suffered fibromyalgia for years and often have a very bad neck which results in wicked headaches. I see a chiropractor regularly who sorts me out and puts me back in alignment. Obviously I'm no doctor, but its just akways a red flag to me when people say they have a bad neck and a bad head, as they are often connected. I do hope your gp can put your mind at rest xx",
