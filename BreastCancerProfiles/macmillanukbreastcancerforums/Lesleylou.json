    "Content": "Hi I was also diagnosed breast cancer after my second mammogram at 54 years. The cancer was grade 1 IDCS. 3/11 nodes affected. I had left mx and ANC. I have been told that rads would be of no benefit but chemo is in the balance . I too have been told that a special test will be used to check if chemo will be needed. I will find this out tomorrow which is two weeks down the line. Maybe this is the same test you mention. I was surprised that chemo was mentioned as I was initially told grade 1 cancer was very slow growing but I think because it has moved quicker than expected they want to be sure. I will probably go with their decision as I feel they know far more about this disease than me but I hope you make the right decision for you. Good luck and all the best for the future. Lesleylou",
