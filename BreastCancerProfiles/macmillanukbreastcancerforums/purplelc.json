      "Content": "Hi Lizzy, Mine is not a wig malfunction story, but when I was between Chemo and Radiotherapy, i had to go to USA with my sister.  I couldn't stand the wig on for long and only wore it when i went out.  I managed to keep it on during the internal flight from Manchester to Heathrow, but when we got on the flight to America I couldn't stand it any longer.  There was a spare seat next to my sister so I whipped off the wig and thew it to her saying can you put that on the spare seat.  Well she shrieked because she wasn't expecting it to land in her lap !!  Then the stewardess came past and how she kept a straight face i don't know.  It took her about 10 passes before she could look me in the face and not at some point over my head ! A woman with hair had got on the plane to be replaced by a completely bald person in the blink of an eye!  We still laugh about it.  I am so glad my hair is growing now as you know and the 13th July is getting closer all the time Love and Hugs  Kim xx",

I think that the chemo kills any little cells - well i hope so.  Sorry this is not a full answer, but just wanted you to know that you are not alone Hopefully you will have chemo like me just to be on the safe side Kim x",

It made me laugh.  I have ditched my rat mostly now that i have a bit of regrowth and have been told i look like Annie Lennox and i should keep it like this.  Well I won't as I don't like it. I only go out in the rat when i go to see my grandchildren as they like to see me with hair. i don't know what they will think when i get the pink hair !!   It's so much quicker to get ready now as you say, but like you can't wait until it takes longer.

So in the middle of July 2016, I had my hair dyed. I did go to the hairdressers though and he did a test on a few strands of my hair before the dye. It has been fine ever since. No problems at all. Oh just to let you know I actually had it dyed bright pink - just because I could ! Didn't go down well with the grandchildren but never mind. When that wore out I returned to my pre cancer blond dyed hair ! Go for it, it made me feel better.  Kim xx",

Talking about mascara, i have been using DreamWeave & Co  - Lash construct and i am sure it's helped them. Also I'm having my hair dyed pink in 5 weeks time, It's very short and until i can get a proper style and get it back to how it was before I am going with the bright pink look.  My oncologist said it would be ok and my hairdresser is doing a test before he tries it on my hair. I know it's a bit bizarre for a 65 year old, but it's my way of getting back at the cancer.  Yes all treatments (apart from the tablets which are not affecting me at all) finished and as everyone else says, it's not pleasant but it is do - able. I hope your radiotherapy goes well Lizzy, mine went well and was so much easier to deal with than the chemo Hugs Kim xx",

I only take anastrazole now nothing like the herceptin, but you are so brave in accepting the side effects, and although as you say its a long haul you will get there.  This site is brilliant and has given me loads of encouragement and help.  Yes we are all comrades fighting a war and the good news is we will win.

I'm sure you won't be winging a lot really, your treatment is lasting longer than mine as i didn't need the herceptin and only had 15 radiotherapy sessions after 4 x TC. Even though i only had 4 chemo i still lost nearly all my hair (had my head shaved when it started to drop out) I did get an itchy rash towards the end of my radiotherapy which was treated with hydrocortisone - you know before all this i never knew the names of any medicines and can reel them off now with the best.  Am having hair done on 13th July, so will post a photo when it's done Lots of love Kim xxxx",

I found I had to build up to playing the full 18 holes of golf, but can manage it great now.

      "Content": "Hi Banjoman, I had  an indentation in my right breast level with my nipple.  To be honest it was there for at least a month and due to my age (65 at the time) I just thought i was getting saggy !!  One morning i thought it had gone and pressed it to see, that;s when i felt the lump.  It felt a bit like a grape.  Got an emergency appointment with my doctor who immediately referred me to our local Cancer dept .  2 weeks later there I was having a mammogram, then an ultra sound followed by a biopsy all in a matter of 2 hours.  I can't lie, the biopsy was a bit painful but only for a second, the nurses were very good also and helped me .  When the needle was going in it made a sound a bit like a staple gun, so they made sure i did not jump when it did. It was over in a matter of minutes and was sore for some days, but very manageable. The consultant came in to see me to ask if I had any questions and said he would have the result in 2 weeks, that was a terrible wait as I knew deep down something was wrong.  My breast had been aching for several months but i didn't think it was health related, i put it down to the power steering on the car being old.   Unfortunately it turned out to be cancer, but the good news is, he removed 2 cancerous lumps and 3 lymph nodes which had traces in.  This  was followed by chemotherapy and radiotherapy and now tablets for 5 years. I just had my 12 months free of disease, my hair has grown again and I am getting on with my life. I do hope your wife finds that all is clear, the waiting is the worse. If it is cancer , then please remember that it is very treatable and so many of us have got through . Try to keep busy, I know that's easier said than done, but it helps Take care Kim x",

I have not had any bad reaction or side effects from the Anastrazole - so this is probably why he does not need to see me.  Good news for me - I hope its the same for you Like you I am still seeing the surgeon and having yearly mammograms.
