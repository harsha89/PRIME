You'll be amazed at how strong you are and all the sh#%t they throw at you will become a surreal routine. Stay close to this group as you go along and the ladies and gents here will help you get through to that finish line. I have found this a great comfort as whatever emotion, symptom or situation you have you will find you are never alone. Good luck with your treatment x",

I was so nervous waiting in the waiting room for the result I thought I was going to faint. When the nurse called me in and said it was fine the relief was indescribable! It's been a hard year with 2 WLE operations, chemo and radiotherapy and many a time it seemed it would never end. To all of you still doing battle please take encouragement from this. You are going through hell but you will have the strength to get to the other side of it and you will be celebrating like I am today. Best wishes xxxx",

I was like you at the start and went pale at the thought of giving myself an injection. I was so proud of myself when I did it for the first time. Then after my 2nd FEC I developed a pulmonary embolism and now I have to have an injection everyday for the next 6 months! The day after each chemo I do the neulastin injection so it's two that day. It's just part of the routine now. Only trouble is I'm loosing weight as my appetite's not so great and the fat reserves necessary for the injection are diminishing fast! Good luck with your injections xxx",

I urge you to see your oncologist before you have any more docetaxel as it could be dangerous to have any more! I had a severe burning skin reaction to my face, neck and hands and my mouth and lips were also badly affected. I was treated with antibiotics, antihistamines, hydrocortisone cream and moisturising lotion. It took a few weeks to improve and my chemo had to be delayed. Because of this reaction they couldn't give me any more docetaxel and changed to paclitaxol which is a milder weeklyversion. I had a problem with neutropenia on this so I was eventually put back on FEC. I got very down about all the problems and delays but fortunately it is behind me now. I hope this helps you but please see your onc as soon as possible! X ",

When I told her what I was currently going through she put together a program of poses especially for people going through cancer treatment. They are focused on relaxation rather than the usual strenuous poses. I can do these at home rather than going to class where I'm at risk of picking up colds etc. When I've finished chemo I will go back to my teacher and she will start rehabilitation poses. Yoga is perfect as it can be tailored to your individual needs. I wouldn't recommend doing it without a qualified teacher though as you could injure yourself. Hope this helps. Xxx",

My problem is that ever since I had the sore mouth, the roof of my mouth has been completely numb. I can't feel it and this affects how food tastes. Has anyone experienced anything similar?

      "Content": "Hi Scribblinglady. Unfortunately it is quite common to have a second operation so don't worry if this is the case. I had a 2nd op to clear margins and I also had one node infected of the 5 they took in the SNB. Finding out about the node came as a great shock as I just wasn't expecting this. I thought I'd have radiotherapy and that would be me cured! I've since realised it doesn't work like that. I was in bits at the thought of having chemo because of the infected node, but the panic eventually turns to acceptance as you concentrate on getting through each step. I had to have an axillary clearance in the 2nd op but all other nodes were clear. My advice is to take each step/news as calmly as you can, ask as many questions of your BCN and medical team as you can and keep away from Google! Remember, whatever your diagnosis or situation is, you will find plenty of lovely people on here with the same experiences to help you through. Good luck with biopsy results! Xx",
