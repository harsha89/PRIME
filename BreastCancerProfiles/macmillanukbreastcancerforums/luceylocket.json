I went to my doctors in August last year and eventually started chemo in February, so a very long journey for me. But cannot fault the treatment I received as I had mammograms core biopsies, CT scans, bone scans etc at least I had a full M.O.T. But   found the waiting between appointments agonising and my imagination was working overtime.At least now I know were I am going. Good luck on your journey you are not alone. wendyx",

My daughters have scaulded me and told me not to diet again until I have come through this period in my life. But like you I have been comfort eating and slowly the pounds are piling on again.I do try to keep control of things and then I go awol, and think what's  the hell life is too short, but I like being slim again and fit and healthyand this will help us in our recovery. I don't think an odd treat will hurt us so enjoy what ever you fancy we have lost weight before so we can do it again when we get over the other side of the hilllots of love and good wishes Wendyxx ALL I CAN SAY IS THANK GOD I FOUND THIS SITE AS IT IS AMAZING Wendyx",

It isn't our fault that we have this disease it is just the luck of the draw.I found out yesterday that an old school friend had it 30 years ago and she never told anyone only close family. I think being open about it and accepting it is part and parcel of the treatment. You cannot pretend it is going to go away by magic or brush it under the carpet.We mus be positive and look forward to our future.KEEP SMILING you are not alone",

Everyone seems to be going away for Easter but I am staying put, there will be plenty of ti.me to go raoming when this phase in my life is over, I will definately make up for lost time then.

So I have been catching up on all the news. It's sad how we lose contact, we don't fall out but just go our separate ways and drift apart. I like to think that we go through life helping each other and what we sow is what we reap, I know mine has come back threefold but sadly I had to have cancer to realise how precious these friendships are. So hang on to your friends you never know when you may need them. They could well be your lifeline. Wendyx",
