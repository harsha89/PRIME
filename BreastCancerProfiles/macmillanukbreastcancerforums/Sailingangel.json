I told them I\u2019m hoping to work throughout so could they perhaps not change my times. They said they\u2019d \u2018fix\u2019 them for me.

The machine didn\u2019t behave as usual, it continued making the zapping noise as it travelled across my body from one side to the other. On the other 11 sessions it\u2019s always delivered 2 zaps then stopped, then went quiet as it travelled across my body to deliver 2 more zaps - thats job done.  Has anyone else experienced a difference in the way their zaps are delivered? The radiographer told me she had set the machine to \u2018auto\u2019 as my elbows allowed that to happen today.  Weird as my arms are always in the same position in the arm stirrups.  I didn\u2019t know there were different ways to deliver the treatment. It was pretty scary when I thought they were still delivering the zaps as the machine crossed over me. The 2 radiographers were training up a trainee today (they let her position me), maybe this didn\u2019t help me when the machine acted differerently!!  Could have done without this today!  Hope everyone else\u2019s session went better.  D x",

I\u2019m using R1 (a gel) straight after my zap in the hospital, then slap R2 (a cream) on when I get home and before bed.  I\u2019m having all my zaps around 5pm as I\u2019m trying to work.  It was some of amazingly lovely women on this site who recommended this gel/cream and so far so good. I also have my boob out quite a lot in the evening when I\u2019m watching TV to keep it cool (husband likes this new development!) and haven\u2019t worn a bra since my op (I haven\u2019t got big boobs and have even less now!!).  Maybe all these little things are helping, along with drinking 2 litres of fluid a day or maybe I\u2019ve just been lucky so far. I\u2019ll see what the next 7 zaps do to me.  Keep brave and strong. Enjoy another day of no hospital appointments! Big hugs Debbie ",
