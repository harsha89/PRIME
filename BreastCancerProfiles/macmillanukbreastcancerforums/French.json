      "Content": "Hi Gem Welcome to the club. This is a great place to be at time like this, I don't know what I'd have done without  the support of the lovely people on here since I was diagnosed with IDC in February. I was grade 1, stage 1/2 with lymph node involvement so I had a lumpectomy and now I'm mid way through chemotherapy with radiotherapy and hormones to follow. It's bewildering at the beginning, and as Skye says, it's a terrible shock but it gets easier, once you get a treatment plan in place and you know your team.  I wish you all the best for the next few weeks, take one day at a time and come here whenever you need to.  Love Sarah",

It's true it does take some getting off after a week, I suppose because there are 7 (in your case 14) coats of the stuff. I put a blob of remover on each nail, massage it in and then leave it for a few minutes, this seems to do the trick although I sometimes have to repeat this process. I had painful index finger nails just after my first tax and was a bit worried but it's gone away and they seem ok, so fingers crossed. Love Sarahxxx",

      "Content": "HI Hannah Glad you're feeling better about it, I still have the odd moment of rage, especially as the holiday date approaches, but now I'm well and truly stuck into treatment, it's no longer at the forefront.  My treatment has been a mixed bag so far, the first chemo session was fine and the side effects were nasty for about 24 hours and then manageable. My problem now is a low white cell count and we've just had to revise our \"reserve\" holiday plans (10 days back in the uk) because my 2nd chemo has been delayed. But I'm certainly not frightened of the chemo any more. I'm on sick leave from work, I'm an English teacher and I'm paid for the hours I'm actually in class so I'm getting state sick pay which in France is half normal pay -  or at least I will be when they sort it out -  I'm complicated because my hours are variable and I actually have 3 different employers. I worked before and after surgery, in fact I went straight from class to the clinic for my op and then back to work 2 days after coming out - but it was hard and I probably overdid it. Our insurance is with Staysure and they are being very slow. I never thought of Saga because I always thought of it for over 50s and I'm not actually 50 yet although my husband is, so when, hopefully we get paid for the cancellation and can rebook for next year (fingers crossed) I'll look at Saga. The start of treatment for me was an enormous relief, so hope you feel the same, just look after yourself and listen to your body. Sarahxxxx",

I saw my GP on Friday who said that the body would reabsorb it with time but I think it's got bigger since then. I see my consultant on Friday morning so I was going to wait until then to ask about it but it's getting me down a bit.

      "Content": "My cousin sent me this article last night and it made me feel angry, given the importance of positive thinking it's incredibly negative but I read on for the advice and then the advice given is not something that most people would be able to follow which then adds guilt to the normal emotional ups and downs we are experiencing (i.e. am I doing everything to make this easier for myself). I feel anything but dead, I feel fantastically alive and grateful that this treatment is going to give me the best chance of getting better. The article actually made me feel (momentarily) negative which I've generally not been at all.  Losing your hair is hard, but it feels harder before you actually lose it than after, once it's gone, for me at least, it was a big relief,  as for the real Russian lady hair stick on wig, the cost is beyond most people and frankly I can't imagine not being able to rip my wig off my head in relief (in front of the mirror and my family - who cares - I like my bald head and my family love me) when I get back from the shops - it gets hot here in the summer.  I also find that sleeping with a bald head has resolved some of the hot flushes I was getting. And then fasting for 4 days before chemo - I for one couldn't do this - I'm already losing too much weight  - I know not everyone is actually sick (I was, very), but  dry heaving isn't a pleasant experience - my onco nurse urged me to eat the lunch they gave me during chemo for this very reason. Anyway, this is just my tuppence worth. Good luck with the start of your chemo Liz, I was terrified before mine but it was a lot better than I had imagined. See you in June chemo club. Sarahxxx",

I was diagnosed in February and at first everyone was saying I'd just need radiotherapy so the holiday would be ok. Anyway despite being low grade and caught early the cancer had progressed to my nodes and so finally it was decided that I would need chemo. It's heartbreaking isn't it??, unravelling the little piece of happiness that you have planned so blissfully and thought about for months. I had a work promotion in September with lots of extra responsibilities, so the holiday was also a reward after what I knew would be a tough year (didn't know how tough at that point). Anyway, like you - a lot of crying, spitting and shouting - was actually hoping the tear stains on my insurance forms would encourage the insurers to deal with it more quickly. You will feel better about it when your treatment starts. Sarahxxx",

I was diagnosed in February and I've now nearly finished chemo, my cancer is a known quantity so I know exactly what needs to be done to fight it, I can get on with it and look forward to the end,which is in sight. This forum helped enormously in those early days and continues to do so now. It's bound to be hard for your family but I think it's important that you open up to them and let them help you all they can, they will get some comfort from being able to support and help you along the way and you will need them too emotionally and practically. It's great to have someone to celebrate the good days and get through the bad days with.  The twinge thing is very normal, even after having every inch of my body scanned, I still worry irrationally about every little twinge, but these days it tends to be a fleeting worry rather than a keep me up all night worry fest.

It's also complicated with sunglasses - yesterday I put my sunglasses under the wig so that they could go behind my ears but then when I went to pull them off it almost dislodged the wig.Also find it difficult not to fiddle with it all the time. The French system is about as generous as the one in the UK it seems - I got 120 euros towards mine and the total cost was around 330 euros (and that was a cheapie).

There was a door with TEP on it and another with scintigraphy and I was taken through the scintigraphy one. They told me it's routine and just for bones as the CAT scan I had i hospital doesn't give enough info about bones.

I have an appointment with the Oncologist on 28th April and an appointment for the pic line on 9th May. I asked the surgeon why I'm getting chemo when it's grade one and he said that it's because of the way the cancer was spreading and that fact that although there were only a few cells in one node, they were very much on the move and not particularly contained within the ganglion. I asked him about a prescription for a wig and he said not yet because the chemo I get may not make me lose my hair - I'm confused now as I thought everyone lost there hair.  Anyway I will ask the Oncologist the same question on 28th April .

It's easy to get into panic mode when facing the unknown and assume the worst, especially when others are having a terrible time. I have to say I panicked a bit about the tax; I had a horrible time on fec but so far (one week after first treatment) on tax I'm more than fine, in fact I'm considering starting to run again, I still have a yucky mouth but that's all, the aches were nothing, just slightly sore knees for a couple of days and my index finger nails are a bit sore, I have plenty of energy.  Karen, I am so happy that you're cancer free, hopefully the taste for cognac will back in time for Christmas.

I've just been told I have to have chemo (was hoping for just radiotherapy) and so I'm having to cancel my 50th birthday celebration holiday. I'm gutted and even wondered about refusing the chemo (it was borderline) because like you I've been looking forward to the holiday since September when it was booked. It's 3 weeks in Sri Lanka and India, so very hard to fit around any treatment.  But talking to the phsychologist I'm now reconciled to putting the holiday off for a year and having a belated 50th plus a celebration for my son finishing his baccalaureate, so maybe that's a possibility for you too if you can't put off the radiotherapy.

It's 6 cycles of chemo, 3 cycles of FEC and 3 of Taxotere, so fairly standard stuff, followed by 30 sessions of radiotherapy and then hormone therapy for 5 years. It all starts on 12th May.Not sure about the Oncologist, I'm used to my surgeon who knows me and is very up front about everything, I felt like he was talking down to me a little bit and I think he thought I was overly preoccupied with the wig- I had to ask him 3 times for the prescription and apparently, normally they don't give this until the first chemo appointment. But I don't want to wait, I want to have time to get used to it and be prepared. Anyway he gave it to me in the end. But he gave me loads of time and said that I should listen to my body and do whatever I want as long as I have the energy and not to worry if I don't, but not to have any expectations because everyone is different,  I have prescriptions for anti-nausea meds, an anaesthetic patch for my port-a -cath, transport to and from the clinic and a blood test which I have to have 48 hours before each session, oh and of course the wig. Going off tomorrow to have my hair chopped off - one of the perks of my job is free hair cuts/colour at the Chambre de Metiers hairdressing school in return for speaking English, so I'm going to give them a challenge (may even have it purple - it's only for a couple of weeks). Despite all the positive stuff, I've had a wobble today, I suppose it finally feels real and I've been inside the dreaded Oncology centre - I've driven past it every day for years and thanked my lucky stars I didn't have to go there - now I do. But hopefully by Christmas I'll be out the other side and looking forward to my postponed birthday holiday. Sarahxxx",

He's probably right about the wig too, but I was just terrified about being bald and not having a wig ready. I get the wig 100% paid for and have been given a list of places to go, so I suppose I can shop around a bit, I have a bit of time.  Unfortunately I absolutely love my new haircut - I'd wanted to hate it so it falling out wouldn't have been such a problem, but hey ho - at least I have an idea for a shorter style when it's growing back and maybe I can get a wig in this style. I also felt a bit sad to be signed off by my surgeon who I've know for 13 years and feel safe with, so I suppose I was unfairly comparing the Oncologist to him. Actually I am sounding a bit wig obsessed.

      "Content": "Hi Carolyn Thanks for that, I am calmer and I do realise I've been very lucky to be diagnosed so early. Just about to leave hospital (without promised results) and I have an appointment with the consultant in 10 days to decide what happens next. I fell into the Google trap after the Mammogram as the doctor said nothing except for \"I'll make an appointment for a biopsy\" before dashing off. They wouldn't give me my dossier or any information before I left. I started reading about Bi-rads (acr in France), so I rang the clinic to ask for my Bi-rads and they told me it was 5. That's when the panic really set in  as I didn't know anything about the size of the tumour, so knowing that Bi-rads 5 means almost certainly cancer all sorts of terrible things began to go through my head. Luckily the biopsy was the next day and I found out that it was very small and didn't seem to have spread but I had 2 days of panic before a complete high and then normal life for a couple of weeks before the op. Anyway, back to as normal as possible for 10 days until the appointment.  Sarah",

      "Content": "Went to see GP this morning and she'd received the pathology report for the lump. Nothing has changed so still grade 1 (hoorah) but it was found in 1 ganglion (6 removed) but very contained in the ganglion, so apparently there's going to be a meeting next week to decide what to do next. I don't appear to be invited to this which is a bit rubbish but then this is the downside of being in France - the upside being that everything happens really quickly and treatment is about need and not cost. GP says expect radio. So I suppose it's good news. Sarah",

I've got an appointment with my GP this Friday (as can't see the consultant until Friday 25th) but I can't wait. Can anyone help me a little bit with the results. It says: Invasive Ductal Carcinoma, Elston and Ellis grade 1. The following is a translation so hope it's right: oestrogen receptors: marking  2 to 90% of cells progesterone receptors - marking 2 to 80 % of cells Ki67: 5% HERCEPTEST 0+ Does this mean anything to anybody or is it lost in translation??

I've been running on and off through chemo and no heart issues at all not even a palpitation. As a worrier myself, I would be inclined to discuss your worries with your oncologist or nurse I'm sure they'll be able to give you a more technical explanation as to why you shouldn't worry than I can.
