      "Content": "Hi - I had reconstruction with LD flap and developed a big hematoma/seroma in my back above the scar. The Consultant had four or five attempts to drain it but when it got to the point (about three weeks after surgery) where I began to feel ill with it, I was whisked in for emergency surgery. Even after that, the second incision drained for about three weeks - I guess I just have a problem with fluid!  I don't know how you have stuck it out for so long - surgery was my solution and really helped, so don't be scared of it!",

      "Content": "You know, I wondered about that too... I was diagnosed in March, had surgery in April, lymph nodes were clear and so no need for radiotherapy or chemotherapy, but have started on Tamoxifen.  So what is the correct way to describe myself - I have breast cancer, I have had treatment for breast cancer, I had breast cancer?  I will be off work for a while yet as I had a mastectomy and LD flap reconstruction and yet outwardly I look fine, so I think people look at me and think everything is rosy and I'm fit and well...",

There are no courses on in July or August but there should be in Sept and October, dates and venues to be confirmed. You need to complete an expression of interest  form - email nilearning@macmillan.org.uk. Hope to see you at one of them!  I'm in Carrickfergus, by the way.",

Weirdly, the one that has caused me the most trouble is Teva and I will be actively trying to avoid it when I order my next prescription. With it, I have bad joint pain, particularly in my feet. Funny, isn't it?",
