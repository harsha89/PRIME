This isn't personal,  the team would seem to work collectively and have a standard form of response what would be super would be to have a name and a method of communication with that person who will actually listen and take what we are saying.seriously.",

      "Content": "Please don't do itI I believe all those braving the shave are doing so for the right reasons, to raise awareness and funds but there are many other ways of doing this, jump out of plane, climb a mountain, whatever floats your boat, by electing to shave your head your actually trying to say I did for them not me, but we are saying we do not want anyone who doesn't have to  lose their hair,  The points we cancer sufferers who have lost their hair are trying to make is 1.not all with cancer do, exactly what are you highlighting for them, 2.losing your hair, that's all you body hair everywhere, arms, legs, face, head, everywhere, is horrendous, I'm not alone in wishing to put the experience behind me, certainly I don't want reminding of the worst thing to happened to me. I'm sorry but I don't thank you for doing this all I can feel is pity, it's awful re-growing your hair, for cancer victims it returns different, course, curly, and our scalps hurt, even the colour alters so the final bit of the old pre cancer us disappears with our hair. Yours will be similar to always but growing it back will be tough. I'm sorry to say it but such an obvious statement is less about cancer and more about the individual, your 15 minutes of fame that I think you'll regret a few months down the line,so please reconsider and find a different route to raise awareness and funds, this one truly is the wrong one.",

      "Content": "I absolutely 100% agree. Ma cMillan need to decide whether raising funds regardless of cost is truly worth it. The campaign is hurtful and insensitive. The fund raising team need a course in emotional and psychological damage - or perhaps aa dose of chemo (God help them) to realise the true effect of this disease. No cancer patient wants anyone to lose their hair, particularly not for such a misguided and frankly humiliating reason as false solidarity and cash. All of my future fundraising efforts will go to research, not MacMillan. How sad an organisation dedicated to caring for people at their most vunerable have done such harm.",

      "Content": "Dear Jess, I am glad to hear you' have notice us and those before us and you  are aware of this discussion but rather horrified that after a couple of years following and hearing the effect Brave the Shave is having on Cancer victims and the genuine anxiety this campaign causes that the  Macmillan response is to not to take action but to continue to \"monitor\" whatever that means and pass our concerns on to Brave the Shave Hasn't two years taught you anything? Rather than monitor perhaps you could act, one positive thing might be to alert those considering the shave that a proportion of cancer victims find their intended action demeaning, humiliating, deeply upsetting and that thanks to emotional aspect of hair loss really quite disturbing,  that for some seeing the result of \"brave the shave\" \"for cancer\" there is the possibility of a deepening psychological effect, especially if they have felt unable to prevent friends or loved ones fron shaving and are expected to be forever grateful while faced  with a mockery of one aspect of  treatment. Those who wish to shave ought as a minimum be informed, even if understanding remains lacking,  enlighten them as to why some of us find their action so distasteful. Should they wish to continue once aware so be it, at least they'll understand the lack of gratitude from those of us who actually have the disease. Macmillan must take full responsibility for the effects of this campaign, including the division between fund raisers and victims. Full disclosure, full understanding, balanced decision making prior to shaving would seem fair, don't you think?  So please stop monitoring, start listening and take action.",
