    "Content": "Hi Saxxy I am so very sorry to hear that you had such an awful experience with Taxotere. I had my first Tax treatment two weeks ago and I'm due to go in again this Friday for my second round. I'm havin Tax first on my regimen and then Fec. My experience was nothing like yours - thank the Lord! - and apart from a couple os side effects (see below) I have been absolutely fine. What did I experience.? Well, I did get a sore mouth rather quickly following treatiment. If you get this, I cannot recommend a product called Caphosol strongly enough. It is licensed for mucositis ( sore mouth) in chemotherapy though it seems a lot of GPs, pharmacists etc. are unaware of its existence. What a shame! Even my Oncologist who is brilliant and absolutely lovely ( unlike some of the sociopathic w*nkers out there) hadn't heard of it. Anyway it's made by a company called EUUSA Pharma and is two small plastic test tubes of clear liquid which you mix together and you end up with a saline-like solution. Also I found myself constipated,d I think from the Ondansatron anti-emetic drug so I needed laxatives (laxido is brilliant and very mild - beware of anything too purging like Senna based products. Once I got these sorted out I was fine. Oh yes, my taste buds are off and I do still have metallic salty taste all the time (a bummer as I like my grub!) but a small price to pay. My only pain was following the GCSF I injections , given to build up your white blood cells. If you are offered this, my advice is to take it, as you have more chance of your neutrophil counts being back up to speed ready for your next cycle of treatment and I took just one codeine at night following injection and I was able to sleep through any pain. Not all oncologists will offer GCSF so ask about it at your consultation!!! I wanted to post this to any ladies out there waiting for treatment involving Taxotere as I wouldn't want people being unnecessarily scared. Poor Saxxy, you really were unfortunate ! It must have been ghastly, but I do think you are in a minority with such severe side effects! I really hope you are feeling heaps better now :-)) Last note: I have been eating really healthily (but by no means cutting out all fat!) and taking loads of vitamin and mineral supplements and I think this has helped me deal enormously with first round of treatment. Good luck all you lovely, brave ladies out there. Stay positive, laugh often, take all the love and hugs you are offered!!! Much love",
