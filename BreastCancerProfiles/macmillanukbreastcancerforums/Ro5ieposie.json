      "Content": "Hi Kimlinda, I felt tired all the way through my radiotherapy. I think its because the body (even a small area) is being bombarded with things that are alien to it. Hope you are getting to sleep okay as that doesn't help either. I found that I was only getting 2-3 hours sleep at night so eventually saw my GP who prescribed sleeping tablets. Really helped me but still felt completely washed out when radiotherapy finished. Rest when you can, get somebody in to do 'heavy housework' and drink plenty. You need to let your body rest and heal. Take care and remember there is a light at the end of the tunnel. Ro5ieposie",

      "Content": "Hi, I too have been taking Letrozole for approx 12months now (previously on Tamoxifen) and experienced the same side effects. I was advised by several people to take SAGE LEAF to combat the hot flushes and night sweats. It has been fantastic. Although I still get have flushes they are not so frequent and the night sweats are virtually non existent. This means that I am sleeping better which, in turn, means that I feel less tired during the day. Give sage leaf a try and I hope it works as well for you.

      "Content": "Hi, I have similar side effects to you. I started out on Tamoxifen and had trouble with hot flushes (very few night sweats). These settled after about 9 months and was feeling really good. Oncologist switched me to Letrozole just before my radiotherapy. I felt really ill during my radiotherapy which I put down to the treatment, change od medication and a fill up of my expander implant just before the start. After the radiotherapy the fatigue, aching joints and flushes did not resolve. I suffered from mild arthritis in my hands but it was even worse. Didn't make any difference what brand I took. One of the radiotherapy girls suggested I give sage leaf a try. As a nurse I didn't really believe that it would work. By October last year I was desperate as the night sweats were really bad and I think they contributed to the fatigue I felt, so I gave it a go. It has been really good. The flushes are still there but not so frequent and not so severe, the night sweats are almost non-existent so I now sleep better and don't feel so tired. Can't give any advice about joint aches and pains except to take Ibuprofen regularly. It doesn't stop the pain but it does make it bearable. Exercise helps but I had to wait until I was not so tired. Back at work now and a lot of the pain has gone. Mind you, tiredness is back but I am putting that down to working! Keep smiling and you will through this. Try sage leaf and see if that helps you.

      "Content": "aroma mum, I have recently returned to work and I am in a similar position as you. I am doing a phased return to work (which I think is going to fast as my job as a nurse is quite physical and I think I need to slow it down). Since I have been away there are so many new faces, outside and inside my department. (I work in a very small hospital of 34 beds so new faces are noticed) Inside my department I feel like a newbie even though most things haven't changed but a few people have. We also have a new Matron appointed and I still haven't met her as she has never been up to the ward to see me. Occupational help has been really good and extended my phased return, all I have to do now is to let people know that I need to have a smaller work load. If I don't I think I will be off sick again. I felt very ill after work on Monday. I do feel positive that things will settle down as long as I am able to go at my own pace but I will be dropping my hours in the near future (I am 60 in 4 months). One question, on your phased return, were you paid your full salary or just for the hours that you worked? I am combining annual leave with the hours that I work so that I get full pay (my line manager carried forward a/l from the previous year to enable me to do this). Best wishes to everybody and I hope everything goes well for you all. Ro5ieposie",

      "Content": "Hi, I had a lot of pain during and after my radiotherapy very similar to yours (had 'phantom' nipple pain as had no nipple). This started at the end of the second week (8sessions) and at the beginning of 3rd week I couldn't take the deep breath needed for me. I saw my oncologist as the breast was very red and looked inflamed. sent me back to the surgeon as they thought it was infected. Wasn't, only had a small seroma. They rested me for a few sessions (3) and I came back the following week and was able to finish course with missed sessions added to the end. Pain continued and I was put on strong painkillers and amitriptyline at night. Worked brilliantly. Have had last op now and back to wok next week. Things do get better but please see somebody to get your pain under control. Don't suffer. Take care. Ro5ieposie",

      "Content": "Hi Tracey, I too had my treatment privately. There is a bcn at that hospital so was able to see her if I had any problems. Can you contact hospital and see if they have one? If not, is there a Macmillan nurse in your area? Also, you should be able to speak to any of the ward nurses who may be able to give some help. Hope you get some help and advice and be able to enjoy your holiday. Florida is awesome but just take things slowly. We spent alternate days lounging about with the other days visiting Disney World and others. And that was when I was fit. Heat shouldn't be too bad at this time of year. Good luck. Ro5ieposie",

      "Content": "I have been undergoing breast cancer treatment, sentinel node biopsies, shrinking lump with Tamoxifen, lumpectomy followed by mastectomy as cancer widespread in breast with reconstruction and expander implant, radiotherapy and, lastly, exchange of implant and reduction on the other side. Tissue from the reduced breast was found to have LCIS (lobular carcinoma in situ). This does not show up on x-rays and so was not spotted when I had a mammogram last October. The risk of this developing into cancer is minimal, especially as I am now on Letrozole. My consultants view is watch, monitor and wait. I am unsure of whether to follow this advice or not. I have felt really good since my last op in January and have now got a start date for going back to work, two weeks time. Any advice please. Thanks",
