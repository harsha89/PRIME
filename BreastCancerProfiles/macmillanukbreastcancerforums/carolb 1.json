Must admit I have found pineapple and cranberry quite good during my Epi, when my mouth has felt crap. As you say its important to keep your nutirtion up, but food is such a pleasure its horrid when everthing you eat tastes like cardboard or worse. Take care Carol x",

      "Content": "Hi Ann I had 4 cycles of Epi every 21 days and will have 4 cycles/2 doses of CMF every 28 days - so 8 but psychologically I tell myself its 4 cycles. Due to have the first CMF next Wed. Feel I'm on the downhill run now. I felt really well with the first two Epi's and then got more tired, I have felt more nauseaous on the last cycle and have now been signed off work :o(( I feel OK, not great but not ill. The hardest things is not having the energy to do the things I could before - but hey it will come back. How many treatments have you got left? PM me if you want. Take care and hope it all goes well.

      "Content": "I was beginning to think it was just me. You have all just described what I am experiencing, well not the pain in my chest but then I haven't had my radio yet, had surgery, just finished chemo and due to have my lymph nodes removed next week. I didn't expect to feel better immediately, everyone warned me it took a while for the chemo to work its way out of your body. But I didn't expect to feel this tired or this stiff. Like Tracey and Susan I can't sit for too long without my joints seizing up, when I get up in the morning I hobble to the loo and feel like a little old lady.... I\u2019m only 51. I recognise the \u201cyou look so well, look at those rosy cheeks\u201d I want to say its not rosy cheeks its a hot flush!! Actually I don\u2019t feel unwell but I don\u2019t feel like me either - my knees, hips and back ache. When I mentioned it to the nurse she said I\u2019d feel tired for a minimum of 6 weeks \u2013 is a bit optimistic or unrealistic. She seemed surprised or non committal about the joint pain \u2013 doh it seems quite common to me. I was quite active before regularly walking, some days I can walk 1.5 miles others I struggle to do Â½ a mile. I try to pace myself, but find it so frustrating when I want to do things and I start it only to find I can\u2019t finish it. Even sitting reading a book is a pain in the ***, because my hips and knees seize. I try to have a mind over matter mentality, but I\u2019m failing because my body isn\u2019t listening.... its either that or I'm being a lazy bugger. But I don't want my life to be defined by undergoing treatment for cancer, I want to make the most of every day and at the moment I can't. Take care all Carol xx",

I forgot all the advice on this site about conditioner, but remembered to make sure it was plugged in again after I went to the look. It is a bit like dipping your head in a bucket of cold water or washing your air in cold water, but it was OK. Good luck Carol x",

      "Content": "Hi Janet They are a pain aren't they, because as you say they leave you so tired. I have to admit for me they were worse when I started chemo, am approaching my 4th cycle and I have the occasional night where its a bit like doing the okey cokey with the duvet, one leg in, one leg out. whole body in, whole body out :o)). I have sash windows, so they are a bit draughty anyway - I leave the latch off so a little bit of air gets through, I let the heating go off before I go to bed so the room cools down, I take a cold drink up with me, I sleep on top of the bed with the duvet folded at the bottom so just my feet/legs are under the covers and most of the time that works for me. I find that if I pull the covers up to my neck its worse so if I have the covers on I try to have them no higher than my chest, mind you I don't have to share my bed - I don't count the dog. Have you tried a summer weight quilt tog 4.5? I also found wearing coton jersey pj's with long sleeves helped me, as I could leave the covers off my top half and still be warm. I have read about a pillow that's supposed to help keep you cool - called a chillow I think, but haven't tried one so no idea if they work. I think the article was in Amoena LIfe Mag, which you can view online. You could talk to your oncologist, but I suspect there is not much they can recommend but its worth asking. Hope you have a cool night Take Care Carol x",

As Cella said it was done as a day surgery, took about 20 mins then I had an xray to make sure it was where it was supposed to be, so all in it took about 90 mins. I've had not problem with mine at all, the nurse flushes it after treatment and thats it. Good luck Carol",

      "Content": "Sorry your chemo was cancelled but probabaly the right decision, you don't want any infection if your immunity is going to go down. What chemo are you having? I have just had my last one and when I look back it wasn't that bad, I consider myself very lucky. It does seem daunting at the beginning you are given all this info and told about taking your temperature and what you can and can't eat, and to add to it you know you have about 8 monthly cycles to get through and it seems forever!. But once you start it does fly by, now I'm at the end it seems like yesterday that the consultant was telling me about my treatment plan. It is hard when you have more ahead of you than behind you, and the half way point can be a bit hard but then you are racing to the finish line. I plotted all of my treatments and my end date on my calender and my outlook calender so everytime a reminder came up I could zap it. At a point when I found it hard round about half way - I just wanted to get of the train and a friend suggested thinking of it as a journey with a start point and an end desitation so you could plot it and tickof the destinations. I decided that at half way I was only in York and wanted to get to Scotland.... and now I am there. After my first treatment, my sister picked me up and as her children were late home we all had McD's and I loved it, I had a little nausea but wasn't sick and the tablets dealt with that. I remember thinking - well whats all the fuss about, this is easy - I was whizing round the supermarket at 7.30am the next day - but in the afternoon I was tired. Everyone will tell you the side effects are cumulative, some cycles they are worse that others, so you may need to pace yourself. My Mac nurse suggested keeping a diary of sorts to help you pick up any pattern in side effects, eg upset tummy, nausea although they do give you meds for this; tiredness, changes in your taste buds etc. It does help and to be honest chemo hasn't stopped me doing things, I was at the Christmas Markets in Germany and Bruges during my 2 cycle. I have gone off certain foods and my taste buds are sometimes affected - but it temporary - and worth it to get rid of those little mutant cells. Take care Carol xx",
