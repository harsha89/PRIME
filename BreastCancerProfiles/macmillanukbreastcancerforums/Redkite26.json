They have fab bras for us post surgery ladies. Hope this helps, regards Alison x",

I too feel lop sided being a large busted lady, although I think even if I was a smaller bust I'd still feel how I do, my scar is horrid and I cry whenever I look at it or catch sight of it in the shower, I know reconstruction isn't going to be perfect but at least it will be made from me and not some foreign implant! Good luck with your reconstruction when you have it. Best wishes, Alison ",

I'm wondering if anyone else has tried this?  I loved my hair when it was just growing back it had a lovely soft wave to it however these curls are like an 80's perm lol!",

I'm happy with my colour which is a lovely grey which is totally different to my pre cancer diagnosis as I used to be plum!  I was told by oncologist to wait 6 months before colouring hair I mentioned this to hairdresser and she agreed with that, I then asked how it was possible to use a perm solution under six months from finishing chemotherapy, she said it would be OK as perm solution doesn't effect hair the same as a colour! I am a tad confused about it & this is why I posted on here. Finished chemotherapy in November 16 now having Herceptin and I'm a third of the way through that treatment. Regards, Alison x",

      "Content": "Hi Kiwicardi thanks for this I saw this on the September chemo group. Are you trying the cold cap? They advised me not to try it due to me suffering migraines!  My hair is shedding quite a bit today, just running my fingers through and I get a good handful of hair! I've got a wig fitting tomorrow so I might take the clippers to it however I'll see if they will do it as they're a hairdressers too? Good luck with your 2nd cycle. Regards, Alison",

I was similar to you & many others who have had a diagnosis for cancer, feeling numb and not taking in what has happened, it all happens so fast that it'll take awhile for your head to catch up with what is going on. I'm sure others will comment on your post, this group are great at offering support to each other. Take it easy & let your husband do a lot of the chores!! Sending warm wishes for Christmas & 2018 Alison x",

I've had 4 treatments and can see the difference,  it costs me £10 per treatment, I also use almond oil a couple of times per day, massaging into critical and nail bed. Hope this helps, Regards Alison ",

My oncologist suggested taking anti-inflammatories the day before treatment & to continue for 3-4 days, this didn't help me however it may help you, I also read somewhere on this site someone recommended a magnetic bracelet, as it helped with there aches, I bought a lovely one from Amazon which also looks good, I've worn it for three weeks now with no improvement, I think we'll try anything within reason to help with side effects! regards, Alison",

I'm wondering if anyone else has come across this whilst have treatment?  I don't understand as I moisturise my hands 2/3 times a day. Thank you for reading, regards, Alison ",
