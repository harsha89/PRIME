      "Content": "Hi Ruby Rose. I'm sure it wasn't meant the way it came across. Please keep on posting, even 5 years down the line I still have low days. I feel guilty as my lifestyle wasn't that healthy and for a long time I felt like I brought BC on myself. In reality I know I was probably just unlucky but that doesn't stop the occasional dark thought. Roundhouse1, I always think it's worse for loved ones, the feeling of helplessness. I agree that may be a bit of straight talking might be helpful as long as Mum knows you'll always love her no matter what and you're available to talk if/when she's ready - don't let her push you away which is what it sounds like she's doing to me. Keep the faith Paula",

      "Content": "Hi Dreamthief, I think the wig entitlement is different around the country. My hospital, Clatterbridge, give you a voucher for Â£150 every 6 months. Top it up if needed though generally able to get a decent one with the voucher. I suggest getting it before the hair goes as it tends to fall out all of a sudden. Speak to BCN. I only wear one if I'm getting dressed up, otherwise caps and hats. Definitely invest in a night time beanie etc as head will get cold as the nights draw in. Hugs Paula",

      "Content": "Hi Lou Have you tried speaking to the work support advisors on the helpline? They will be able to tell you your rights and give you lots of support. You don't need work worries - you have enough to deal with. One thing - you need to plan for all eventualities as you don't know how the chemo will affect you. You might be absolutely fine and just need a couple of days every 3 weeks or you might be completely floored and not able to work at all. Probably you'll be somewhere I between. I do know that the equality act means they have to make reasonable adjustments and you can't be discriminated against because of your cancer. Please get advice, know your options and your rights and good luck. Paula",
