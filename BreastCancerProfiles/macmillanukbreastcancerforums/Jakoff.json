    "Content": "My mum has recently been diagnosed with breast cancer it is HER2 Positive with a 3+ result. She has already had all the lymph nodes from under her arm removed and she is due to start chemo on monday, She doesnt have a tumor, however the doctors have said they cant be certain there are no other cells in the body hence the splatter approach of chemo, herceptin and radiotherapy. Has anyone else not had a tumor or lump in their breast. She hasnt started chemo yet, as previously mentioned she starts this on monday, but im getting worried as for a week now she has been getting very strong headaches had some vomiting and a lot of the time feels drained or very dizzy like shes going to pass out. I've googled online (i know not the best idea) but it suggests it could have already travelled to her brain and there could be cells forming in the brain. Can anyone shed any light on this? If anyone had any more information that would be great, I just feel a bit lie we're being kept in the dark Thank you and good luck to all of you   x    ",
