    "Content": "Well cancer arrives most often without notice. It is hard to decide who in your circles to tell and how to tell them. I have always been somewhat reserved but decided I needed all the support I could get and was very open with people. You soon find out your true and supportive family, friends and work colleagues. Most were face to face & many due to distance / different countries were phone or email, the method of communication made no difference to the support offered. TheÂ  worst people for support or contact were my work colleagues & HR, unbelievable but true. Then I realised in spite of asking my line Manager to advise other colleagues, he did not. Why I do not know, but when I returned to work it was obvious that quite a few colleagues were asking after me & the messages were never passed through, I found this more upsetting than the lack of contact. Sorry cannot help on FB or Twitter etc as I am not signed up to them.",
