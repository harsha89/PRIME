      "Content": "Here are some things that have worked for me while I've been on the breast cancer journey: a. After my operation I came home in my dressing gown - couldn't face getting dressed b. Bought bra extenders from Amazon when my chest seemed to have expanded and my bras wouldn't do up c. I went to a nutritionist and she suggested supplements to help me through the chemotherapy and recovery from breast cancer. She is a member of BANT so look for that if want a nutritionist . d.I went to an excellent wig shop in Southend with my NHS wig prescription - they had an amazing selection esp helpful for someone like me who has a large head. The wig was styled and I ended up with the bob that I had always wanted. Lots of people didn't realise that it was a wig. e. This is something that I have not seen on this group. I went to a hypnotherapist, we discussed what I wanted from hypnosis, she then wrote the script - I read it and made any changes. I went back and she used that script while I was hypnotised. She made a CD which then downloaded to my phone so I could listen to it when I wished. It focused on coping with chemo and that the treatments would workÂ  and I would recover.",

      "Content": "I am about to start chemo on Monday and very worried about what reaction I might have as I suffer from multiple food intolerances, some chemical and some unidentified substances. Also concerned that it might make my reaction to the foods worse or increase them. The medical staff have been unable to offer me any information and have not dealt with this before. Has anyone got any ideas? Thanks",

      "Content": "Dear Carolyn I got on fine and have had limited side effects. I had a headache and nausea on Tuesday and today feel much better apart from bags under the eyes. I was given Piriton before the chemo which hopefully has helped. I went and had a session with a hypnotherapist which was to help with my body accepting the chemo and the supplements and getting the cancer out of my body. It seems to have made me much calmer - my consultant noticed I looked much more relaxed. Thanks for asking after me. Rox",
