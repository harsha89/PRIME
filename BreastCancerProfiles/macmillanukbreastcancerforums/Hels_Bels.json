      "Content": "Hi Kate, I've had two rounds of AC which is slightly different but I experienced the same as you - I used the cold cap but my hair started thinning on day 15 and after a week of it I was sick of having it on my pillow , in my food and  clogging the drain in the shower. I also had a noticeable bald patch by this time so decided to shave it off. A week on I'm so glad I did it. I've embraced the bald look and have had lots of compliments on it . I've also got a collection of hats, scarves and a couple of wigs I got very cheaply from wigbank.co.uk to choose from. I'd definitely recommend making an appointment at a wig shop so you can try some and decide if you want to go down that route.  Also very happy not to have to shave my legs and bikini line!!! I've not lost eyebrows or lashes (yet) but there's great make up available should that happen. Wondering if anyone has tried the 'magnetic ' false lashes I've seen advertised on Facebook?  Best of luck with it. And this also means no more cold cap - yipeeee!! Hels xxx",

      "Content": "Hi there! Thanks for replying. I was due to start AC chemo yesterday but they found I had a slightly raised level of bilirubin from my bloods. The Doctor thinks I probably have a condition called Gilbert's syndrome which is harmless but they have to go ahead with more tests to make sure my liver is OK before starting chemo. Yesterday I had an ultrasound and they said it all looked normal but I've now got an appointment on Monday with a hepatologist to make sure all's well.  I have had my hair cut the shortest it's been since I was 14 in preparation and I've also had a manicure and pedicure with dark nail varnish as that's supposed to help with nail damage.  I was feeling a bit down yesterday as i was keen to get on with it but feels good brighter today. How are you doing? Any progress?  Hels_Bels xxx",

      "Content": "Hi there. I'm new to this forum too. It sounds like  an oncotype test that you are waiting for the results from. I believe it looks at the genetics and gives you a score of likelihood of reoccurrence of cancer so the doctors can pinpoint with more accuracy who would benefit from chemotherapy.  If you score 18 or below you don't need chemo, if you score 30 or above you definitely do. I got my result this morning and I was 22 but the oncologist has recommended that I do have 4 rounds of AC chemo. It's all a bit overwhelming to be honest.  Good luck with your appointment next week, it must be doubly difficult doing it in ano there language! Xx ",
