      "Content": "Evening everybody, this is my first time writing on here and im not sure if i have come to the right place..i hope so..My name is heidi and im 36 years old..i was diagnosed with breast and secondary liver cancer and was told i am terminally ill and was given 12months to 3 years to live...i'm still here though and plodding along...I had a bi-lateral masectomy earlier this year and have now been told that i can have reconstructive surgery..i went to see my surgeon the other day and to be honest i was quite upset with the outcome of going to see him.  I have had a bad experience with him before as on the morning of my surgery he came upto me and told me that he had decided to take my lymphnodes out as well but i did understand that it wasnt going to cure me didnt i!!!...to him then walking off and leaving me stumped..this time around he told me that he would prefer that i had the back flap surgery as im a little on the cubby side and have enough fat in that area to have that type of surgery plus it will make the breasts more realistic...well if im honest i would prefer the implant surgery as i have been through enough trauma this past year and i think that a nice perky pair would suit me more...lol...thinking victoria beckham...hehe...basically is what im looking for is anybody who has had reconstructive surgery either implants or the back flap surgery to help or advise me on hoe they felt how they coame to the decision of what was best for them and if i should seek a second oppinion from another surgeon, its distressing enough to have cancer but when you dont have full security with your surgeon im now second guessing on what to do for the best...any help advice would be appreciated..thankyou...xx  ",
