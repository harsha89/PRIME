      "Content": "Hi Hides I am on Tamoxifen since last August, I was taking my tablet in the morning and by lunchtime I was feeling the pain I wasn't sure if it was the Tamoxifen or my rheumatoid arthritis so I started taking the tablet at 2pm and it helped improve the aches and delayed it til the evening at least I was at home by then. I was given naproxen but had a allergic reaction with itching all over like nettle rash, now I am pain killer free. I always get the same brand Relonchem Tamoxifen as I read that different brands effect everyone differently it's to do with the various bulking agents they use in the tablets so it might be worth asking your chemist for a different brand as it might be better suited to you. Relonchem was the first brand I had and now I'm settled with its side effects so I won't change from them I must admit every day I have to take those horrible tablets I have tell myself its preventing the beast and refrain myself from throwing them in the bin. Only 4.5 years to go lets hope I have the staying power  make sure you keep drinking enough water on the Rads it does make a difference and of course moisturize bucket loads Good luck to you on your journey  Debs xx",

Have a lovely day xx",

I made my way back via the shop for my reward somef hot cross buns",

Meno or Post or was it whether I'm spring chicken, old bird or a boiler :) but they only did one blood test for it which points to post meno but not conclusive so in 2 months a blood test for 3 weeks on the trot then they can find out, but what they did tested for which they didn't say was tumour biomarkers and it was negative so I was very chuffed but a bit surprised as I thought it wasn't tested for and it would just be the mammogram, the decision was to stay on Tamoxifen as I'm arthritic its best to leave me alone whilst I'm pain free and not to rock my boat with change of pills I've done plenty of sitting in armchair and sadly no walking, but I ventured out to take picture of daffodil a little ray of sunshine I do love the spring xxx  ",

I normally come back  with more than I go with thanks to Mum, but this time I came back and Monday came down with a stinky cold, sore throat, sickness, chills and aches and Tuesday and Wednesday spent the days sitting in the armchair my fatigue hit me pretty bad, My partner really doesn't understand the fatigue I think until you have it you don't understand it. It took my 1 hour to get the ump up to get to the toilet yes I was busting by then. not managing to eat much so its just consomme soup and a slice of bread which brings back memories of chemo days,  so no walking for me this week :(  just me, the armchair and my blanky, thank god for the winter Olympics.

I even go there when its raining, I always walk with the wind behind me (not that type!!) ha ha  I started walking before Christmas as after BC treatment I had the pleasure of being left with Degenerative disc disease so walking is the best treatment then now its given me inflamed metatarsals in my left foot so I take my time just putting one foot in front of the other and I will get there, I get over taken by older people but thats Ok I've got the time to enjoy my walk, I have a app on my phone that tells me how far I have walked but now I fell guilty if I miss a day I understand the bit about being safe, I won't walk through an area of gorse and shrubs just in case,  I always think better safe than sorry Keep up with your walking, if we can do it in the winter then by the summer we will be fitter and ready to enjoy the sun, I was told to get out to see, to feel, to experience and to enjoy life This picture is for especially for you, I took it yesterday ",

I had totally forgotten the BC. but having this stinky cold is I realise I'm not invincible and where as before I could strruggle on now the fatigue rears its ugly head to remind me to be kind to my body and it still needs time to recover, I am now on Citalopram and having success with no hot flushes so in all everything is happy in my life:) Debs xx",

      "Content": "Hi everyone, I have been away from numerous months and was thoroughly enjoying my newfound freedom of walking and doing this with my partner of 18 years with my breast cancer year of 2017 under my belt and just carrying on with the Tamoxifen I thought my life was perfect, during that horrendous year my partner lost his father due to lung cancer. But in 2018 we started to see happiness again and thought we were living the dream, I passed my first year mammogram with flying colours and celebrated in an alcohol free way :-) and then the bombshell was dropped on our world, this is worse than having the breast cancer myself my partner was diagnosed with stage II liver cancer and unbelievably a week later this was upgraded to a grade 4 liver cancer and three lymph nodes and lesions on his pancreas so now I find myself in a truly horrendous position of supporting my partner go through palliative chemo, I find it excruciatingly painful from being the patient to now being his carer and helping him through this, I would have gladly have gone through it again for him not to have to deal with this, my walking these days are confined to work and walking the hospital corridors again I cannot work out why I survived breast cancer to watch him suffer with liver cancer or did I survive to help him I'm still undecided on this, my tears are now free-flowing again, I have also decided to stop my Tamoxifen as why would I want to extend my life whilst he's has been shortened, we have been together so long we never felt the need to be married, this has changed our views drastically and we decided we need to get married ASAP, so my life is in total turmoil again due to this horrible horrible cell, I am trying so hard to be strong on the outside but only succeeding in being a mess on the inside, so i am back here and being a not so happy bird :(  Love, success and happiness for everybody on here xxxx",

Any advice from you knowledgeable ladies would be appreciated  Tomorrow I'm definately going for a walk but no way will I be doing 8 miles I'm not that brave yet :) Debs",
