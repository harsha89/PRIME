      "Content": "Hi Val Thanks for your reply.  Had it done yesterday.  Went straight into theatre and had injection whilst I was under GA.  No idea if I had the radioactive injection.  Definately had the blue dye one - got the blue boob and matching urine to prove it! Was your snb and lumpectomy recent? Helen    ",

      "Content": "Hi Val I have been told I need a mx which will now be done in the New Year.  Was diagnosed on 28th Oct and have had lots of biopsies, MRIs etc.  Was offered mx on 28th Dec but said no as I wanted to enjoy the Christmas hols with the kids.  Then they decided I should have a SNB first which I had on that date. Seeing consultant on 11th Jan. Was yours a very big lump?  Mine is 13mm (well it was when it was first diagnosed!). Take care Helen    ",

      "Content": "I have a SNB on 28th December.  Because the day before is a Bank Holiday I won't be having the injection the day before to help locate the node.  Nurse spoke to my husband (I was at work) and said there is a different procedure they can do.  Does anyone know what this is?  If everyone does have injection day before, why are they saying they can do it differently?  Breast Care Nurse wasn't available this morning as it is Saturday.  Can't speak to anyone now until the day of the op. Would be grateful for any advice as to what this other procedure is.  I just hope it is just as accurate! Thanks.",

      "Content": "Hi Flowers Just a brief message as I really should be going to bed!  Please, don't let it \"Surround and suffocate\" you.  Cancer is a monster but it can, and will be killed.  Think positive thoughts - thousands and thousands of women have been through what you have and have come out smiling on the other side. Yes, the treatment is unpleasant but plan treats for yourself to look forward to.  Have a girly night in with a bottle of wine, enjoy a bracing walk with your partner - whatever you enjoy doing.   If it has spread to your nodes it is not a huge deal.  They just whip 'em out!  As someone else says, it simply helps the medics plan the most effective treatment for you. Blow away that fog! xx",

Take care. xx",
