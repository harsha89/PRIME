    "Content": "it is reassuring to see( although not for you) that I am not the only one finding sleep difficult I've tried all sorts from warm milky drink, alcohol to sleeping tablets with not much joy, quickly running out of options but hopefully when I get pathology results next week i'll feel bit more relaxed,obviously depending on the results, but the advice and support that is available on here is a great help especially when you don't have a good family support network..my hubby looks at me in horror when he gets up to go the loo in middle of night because i'm on here but if he's not willing to talk about it then what am I supposed to do?.. cathryn x",
