      "Content": "So, its been a year since my lumpectomy and I had my first Mammo on Friday which was quite an event. Had to have extra pictures taken and also an ultrasound as my boob has changed so much. Now I'm not sure if its because of the mammo, but all of a sudden I feel worried the cancer has come back. I have a shoulder pain (from moving furniture) and I'm convincing myself its cancer. I try to rationalise my thoughts, but this is doing my nut in!! Does anyone else feel like this?",

      "Content": "Thank you all for your replies. After posting I decided to read back through other peoples experiences & felt a million times better knowing I'm not the only one that is anxious! Shoulder still aches but has eased compared to this morning & just said to my mum I think some of it could be stress! The Dr prescribed me anti inflamortories so hoping they kick in soon too.Â  Thank you lovely people! Xxx",
