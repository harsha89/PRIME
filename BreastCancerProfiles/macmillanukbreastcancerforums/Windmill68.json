      "Content": "Waiting is just rubbish isn't It?!! Kept myself busy all week but odd pockets of feeling anxious. Been pretty good at ignoring Dr Google and I liked the suggestion of only allowing set times during the day to think about it, that has certainly worked. While not regretting keeping it all to myself for now it does feel a bit lonely to have a worry and not be able to chat or joke about it with anyone. Combined with the upsetting news all week and having a rotten cold - I think it's time to cracking open the wine! Roll on Wednesday so I can closer to a yes or no xxx",

      "Content": "Thank so much for all your replies, seems a bit daft to be worrying when I know absolutely nothing yet but good to hear that is sort of normal :)  Also starting to feel odd keeping quiet about something that feels such a worry, I was out with friends last night and almost said something. If my boys weren't in the middle of their exams I probably would be talking about it to my best friend but I am paranoid the boys would soon get wind something was up. I had letter from the hospital, appointment for the breast unit is for Wednesday week on the 31st. So now it's just about trying to put it to the back of my mind and restrain myself from googling :) easier said then done eh?!! I am self employed and work from home so WAY too much time to think...keep giving myself pep talks though about no use stressing untill you know those test results. Thanks again for your messages, I'll pop back and let you know how it goes on the 31st xxx",

      "Content": "Hi, I saw my GP yesterday after finding a lump in my breast and she has referred me on to be seen in the 2 week fast track system so just got to wait for them to get in touch. I was expecting that and was feeling quite calm going in to see her as my lump is both smooth and moveable and I am aware the vast majority of lumps turn out not to be cancer.  However she has got me nervous! She had a good feel around my breast and armpit, took down family history (maternal grandmother has mastectomy) and then put a super serious face on to say she was really very concerned about the lump and as I left she said 'good luck'. I was expecting the 'don't stress, just a precaution, 9 out of 10 lumps are fine' kind of talk so not sure if she could tell something from the exam.  Not much to do apart from wait and see now, hard to stop over thinking though isn't it? I am not telling anyone around me as I am single mum to 18 and 15 year old boys who are slap bang in middle of A levels and GCSE exams...decided there is no need at this stage to freak them out and if I tell anyone else I can't be sure word wouldn't get back to them. So for now you are the only people who know, nice to have somewhere to go to get things off my chest while I wait xx",

      "Content": "Hi Gumpo, this week bound to be a bit tense for us both...I'm not usually one to wish days away but just want to be on the other side of not knowing now, whatever the outcome. I know our appointments this week are unlikely to give us a concrete answer and chances are there then may be more waiting for test results  - this waiting is way harder than I expected! Let's both do our upmost to avoid the googling and I'll have my fingers crossed for you on Friday. xxx",
