    "Content": "Hello Maureen Jean, Treeze and Jules, first of all thank you for all your open, honest comments. I am really glad to find this site, because I was looking for people with the same problem of bi-lateral mastectomy and in Germany it is rarely to find- only 2% of the women do a preventive mastectomy after once having contracted breast cancer on one site. So thank you. I had had breast cancer on the right site in December 2003. The tumor had a size of 1,3 cm - not too huge. But because of my family-breast-cancer-situation they did a sub-mastectomy with reconstruction within the back muscle latissimus dorsi. It wasn't painful at all. I got a PCA, with which I could regulate the painkillers on the first day and on the second day I only got Paracetamol. I felt very well, no reasons to be afraid. At the moment I am awaiting the results of a cyst-punction (left side), whether there are cancer cells or not. But anyway my doctor adviced me to let him do a second sub-mastectomy on the left site with reconstruction within the back muscle. I feel encouraged so much due to your comments. I had no problems to get back the full repertoire of movements after the OP in 2003 (10 lymph nodes were removed on the right site in 2003). And the scar recovered perfectly well. Here in Germany they have breast-centers with specialists but I guess in UK and USA your doctors are very well trained because in the reports I read all people mentioned that it is usual to do preventive bi-lateral sub-mastectomy with reconstruction in UK and USA. What I would recommend is a subcutaneous mastectomy with a parallel reconstruction (silicone or back muscle). But anyway, every/any decision, made by you Maureen Jean, is right. I'll keep my fingers crossed for Monday, 11th, Maureen Jean. You will go through this operation very well. I send you so much thoughts, love Regina",
