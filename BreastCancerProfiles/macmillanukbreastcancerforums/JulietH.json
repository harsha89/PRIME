      "Content": "Hi. I am wondering whether my mother's experience is a common one.She had breast cancer in 2005 at age 71 and had a mastectomy. Even though it had spread to the lymph nodes she was not offered chemo.Instead she had radio went on to tamoxifen. At the time she was so relieved at not having to have chemo, and so trusting of the consultant who had said it was not the best course of action, that I could not bring myself to start pushing her towards asking for it. My sister, who lives in USA, was very upset and said that Mum should definitely have chemo. Now, 4 years later, our mother is very unwell with painful secondaries in the spine. Radio is no longer helping. I now hear that chemo is quite often no offered to the over 70s on the NHS, though it might well have been helpful. Does anyone have any experience of this?",

      "Content": "Thank you for your replies. I did manage to speak to my mother's (new) consultant yesterday. He looked back at her notes from 4 years ago (different consultant) and commented that her age of 71 would have been a factor (admittedly one of many) at that time (2004).Apparently it is becoming less of a factor now as chemo treatment is continually improving and mortality rates in the over 70's have dropped. So, with the same cancer and same other conditions, mum might have been offered chemo if she had had the mastectomy now - 2009. I have posted this in case it is of use to anyone else - age can be a factor but, for obvious reasons, it is almost impossible to get doctors to admit it. So - if you or anyone you know at age 70+ is not offered chemo make sure you find out exactly why. Best wishes to everyone dealing with this devastating illness. You are all so brave. Juliet x",
