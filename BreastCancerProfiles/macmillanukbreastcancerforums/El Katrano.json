    "Content": "Hi there - I got advised to paint my nails a dark colour as it's the nail reaction to UV light that triggers potential problems. Also use Acetone Free Polish remover too. I've painted mine navy blue as it's \"in\" this season and seems to go with most things. Of course you can try Purple too. And make sure if you get any chips that you coat over it. Apparently you can get UV Protecting Clear coating too but haven't tried that as dont know anyone who has and had results from it. I've had every reaction going so far but I've done a round of Taxotere and not had nail problems yet, they've felt very sore but not discoloured or fallen out.. My BCN says that falling out is very rare BTW. And BTW< you're not vain, god we have so much to cope with and it's hard feeling feminine when you're bald, scarred, knackred etc, take it where you can!",
