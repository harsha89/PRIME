I am 48 and have spent most of my life laughing, it's just the way I am, yet my breast nurse does not seem to have any kind of sense of humour. I know it is a serious matter having breast cancer, yet I feel that with my nurse I cannot be myself and I am holding back.  She will be with me for the next five years and I dont want to change who I am, or what I do yet I feel she is suppressing the real me.  Dont get me wrong, she is lovely and sweet, just not what I need.  Has anyone changed their breast nurse or do you know of how I can go about it? Thank you all.  Amanda xx",

      "Content": "I had my lumpectomy and some nodes removed 25th March.  Went back in 7th April to have node clearance as evidence of a spread.  Since then I have had problems with my scar healing and my boob going red, hot and swollen.  After numerous visits to the hospital, my own doctors, my nurse etc, the breast nurse discovered that the desolvable stitches had not desolved so she removed them. She seemed to think that this was the reason my scar was not healing. I was then put  on antibiotics (long term) for the redness in my lower boob.Neither my surgeon or my breast nurse seem particularly bothered about this, which I do find rather strange.  My surgeon also took me back into hospital 2 weeks ago to scrape out the wound and re-stitch the section of the scar that was not healing.   After my dressing came off I noticed that the surgeon had appeared to stitch 'above' the hole in one place instead of over the wound.  I mentioned this to him last week and he just shrugged and said, 'oh well, it's not looking any worse than before I stitched it!'.  He made me an appointment to see a radiotherapy consultant for this week.  Where he had 'scraped' the wound, it had begun to scab over so I was not too worried. Today my boob was sore when I woke up and I noticed that it had begun to swell again and the redness had started creeping up my boob.  I went to have a bath and looked in the mirror and I am gutted that the wound has opened up again :(   I cannot start my radiotherapy until the scar has healed and I feel really let down by my hospital and my surgeon.  Ive made an appointment with my GP for tomorrow to ask if I can be seen by a different hospital as I have lost all faith in the one I am under. Sorry to rant, I know others are much worse off than me but I just needed to get it off my chest Amanda",

All of us who had breast surgery the day before were sent home (sign of the times I think in the NHS these days). Happy to be home, but did not feel that I was given enough information by the hospital on discharge.  I dont know if I am to keep the dressings on, if I can bath, if I have to continue to wear a bra 24hrs a day etc so will be ringing my BC nurse later.  On the plus side, my bed felt like the best place ever when I crawled into it last night.  Hope everyone has a happy day Amanda xx",

      "Content": "Thanks Lorna xx Carla, I am  also a little concerned that it may have spread to the lymph nodes too, but my theory on this is I wont know till next Wednesday and I am not going to waste a week worrying about it.  I have far more important things to do like loving my children and appreciating all the support I am getting from friends and family.  This group is amazing.  I am so glad I stumbled across it.  I managed 7 hours sleep last night with the help of tramadol so I feel much better today.  Not so shaky or wobbly and just feel better in myself.  Its hard not being sucked into a false sense of security though about my fitness levels!  Anyway, if there is anything else I or anyone else can help you with, just ask.  The support here is great and there is normally someone around who will reply to you pretty quickly.  But as someone else has said, use your breast care nurse or your GP.  Please dont sit at home/work worrying about things.  Take care of yourself.

On Monday I go and have that radioactive (I think) injection into my boob and Surgery is scheduled for Tuesday morning and I am dreading it, along with not being able to wait as I know then that this horrid little lump will be out of me by Tuesday afternoon.  Fingers crossed it will then be a case of healing at home for a while then 3 and a half weeks of radiotherapy. Laughter has helped me though all the tough times in my life, and I have no intentions of changing that.  My sense of humour may be slightly warped at the moment but it lightens the dark times.  I am having more up days than down ones, so I am thankful for that.
