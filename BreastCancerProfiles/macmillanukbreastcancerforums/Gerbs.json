      "Content": "I have had less nausea but still need to take meds for that, I've got some peripheral neuropathy (temporary nerve damage causing a pins and needles numbness in the fingers and toes and both feel very cold a lot of the time), the runs (easily controlled by tablets), a recurring rash on my hands (Dr has prescribed Emulsiderm to wash them with which makes a huge difference), continued tiredness and yes, bone pain (paracetomol and voltarol help there). My body hair fell put again but my head hair hasn't been affected oddly. Oh and the bloody nose which is pretty miserable. My advice is to list all side effects and tell your Oncology team, most they can help you with.",

      "Content": "I was just diagnosed Thursday and it is an awful lot of info all at once. Thankfully I'm not facing surgery straight away, I will be starting chemo this week with surgery to come later but like you I found it a lot of information all at once. I wish I'd written down what was said or been provided with a written summary. And yes I'm being told 'you'll be fine, your strong' etc. Wouldn't it be nice if people gave you permission to not be strong just once in a while?",
