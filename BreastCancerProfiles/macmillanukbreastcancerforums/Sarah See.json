      "Content": "Hi Bosco, I had three small grade 2 tumours in one breast. A mastectomy was done 4 weeks ago with a LD flap. There was micro metastasis in the two senitel nodes sampled. I was told that for me, the value of radiotherapy was questionable. If I'd only had one tumour, the oncologist said radiotherapy wouldn't have been offered, three tumours, the decision was up to me. I decided not to have radiotherapy. It's not like there's no other follow up. As a friend said \"they'll keep a close eye on you\". I've started tamoxifen, which I'll be on for 10 years. The oncologist described the different research which guided the decisions made, I knew in advance from the breast cancer surgeon that there was a difference of opinion between the oncologists about whether or not I should have radiotherapy. The differences of opinion were because i didn't exactly fit into the study characteristics. I felt I was able to make an informed choice. Maybe you could ask your oncologist to let you look at the research that guides their decisions. The plastic surgeon had told me that if I had radiotherapy which damaged the reconstruction, there were things that could be done to repair it. Although as I still was in a lot of pain (now in less pain, but there's still some) I hated to think I'd do anything to damage the work that'd just been done. Don't know if this helps. Think there're so many different variations, it just dends on the characteristics of the breast cancer we have. Hope you're recovering well. It's a fairly shitty time! But I'm seeing a light at the end of the tunnel. Love Sarah",

      "Content": "Hi Daphne, I can imagine it must be hard to cope with the second blow so soon after the first.  For the little that it's worth: I had a right LD reconstruction with an implant as well at the same time as the mastectomy.  The left side was reduced to match.  That was all 5 months ago.  I wouldn't say I have no sensation in the reconstructed side.  It does feel different, maybe denser.  If I run (which happens briefly and infrequently!) I'm aware of it.  Otherwise, I'm now able to have times when I don't think about it.  It's not great, I know, but for me, it hasn't been awful.  Well, the surgery was and a few weeks after, but I was back at work after 7 weeks (part time, not heavy, phased return).  What happened in my head was harder almost than dealing with my body.  It's a dark time in our lives when we have to deal with breast cancer, but with the (horrible) treatment I think about 90% of us are cured. Numbness and anger, yeah, I understand that!  Be kind to yourself. love Sarah",
