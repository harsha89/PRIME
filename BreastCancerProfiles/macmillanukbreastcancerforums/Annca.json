      "Content": "Actually I was quite relieved to hear that research shows that neither aluminium or parabens are linked to breast cancer. I did some research and found several deodorants that contain neither and bought a couple of them, but they don't seem to work well - especially during the inevitable hot flushes! I think it must be the aluminium that turns them into anti-persperants. I found one by Weleda that smells nice, for about an hour! Incidentally, I thought aluminium was linked to Alzheimers, not breast cancer - who knows - the thinking seems to change every 5 minutes. If anyone saw tonight's news you'll know that we now have to give up even one unit of alcohol per day - it's hard to know what to take notice of, and what to ignore!",

      "Content": "Am interested in this, as I presume you and your consultant were reasonably happy that you were post menopausal before he prescribed this. Do they just take your word for it and not do a test? I was on HRT for 8 years from the age of 49 and was not through the menopause when I started it. When I was diagnosed with my oestrogen receptive cancer I had to give it up very quickly, but would have assumed that somewhere along the line my menopause would have finished, especially as I'm now 57! I have to discuss hormone treatment next week and was thinking of asking for Arimidex as Tamoxifen is associated with deep vein thrombosis and I work as cabin crew (although not sure I'll be going back) - maybe I should ask for a hormone test to confirm the menopause is actually complete?",

      "Content": "Just out of interest Rabbit, when I was in hospital a couple of weeks back having a DIEP flap reconstruction, there was a lady in my ward who had the same condition as you and was having a double mastectomy and reconstruction for preventative reasons - although she had waited till she was 44. She had decided to have immediate reconstructive surgery as then they can use the 'skin sparing' method which means you end up with far fewer scars, and she also thought that it would be less traumatic to wake up with 'new' breasts. True the recovery period is much longer, but at least there's only one, and when you're finally recovered you never have to think about it again. Very best of luck, Ann",

      "Content": "This is a coincidence, after a disturbed night I was just looking into buying a chillow after reading many positive comments on here. The cheapest website I found was www.embracethechange.com/Chillow, they have a sale so they're £20.99 instead of £24.99. I might even buy one as everyone says how wonderful they are! Janet, I shouldn't imagine your oncologist would have a problem with you trying one. Incidentally, my own hot flushes are from suddenly giving up HRT when my bc was discovered in October, and in the next couple of days I have to start Tamoxifen, so I guess then they'll get even worse........yes, think I will definitely send for one!!

      "Content": "Hello everyone, It was nice to find this site. My main problem is coming to terms with all this. As I cried all the way through my appointment I didn't take too much in (and I'm usually such a 'together' person!!). It went a bit like this: 24.8 Routine Mammogram 1.9 Letter asking me to go back for biopsy 9.9 Results of biopsy - DCIS 2.10 Lumpectomy, not too bad, healing well 15.10 Told it's worse than they thought, mastectomy and reconstruction next Friday No mention of meeting a plastic surgeon, no discussion on whether I'll need radiotherapy which I gather wrecks the reconstruction. I have to go back and see photos of reconstructions (flap from back type with inflatable implant). I'm told the results aren't great and not to expect it to look like a real breast, yet I've read things on here that say people have been thrilled with the results. Feel I need more time and more info, which I guess I can get but would love to know if anyone else has insisted on waiting a bit, or had a reconstruction by anyone who isn't a plastic surgeon, or who has any views on whether a reconstruction can look reasonable........ I am divorced and feel my chances of ever meeting anyone nice have just disappeared out of the window! I feel a bit as if the rest of my life has disappeared and I know I will lose my job as cabin crew for an airline has it's just too hard and physical for someone who will only slowly regain their mobility. Anyway, I know it doesn't sound like it but I am trying to be positive, come to terms etc. but I need some more understanding. Any help or advice would be really welcome as not sure where to turn. I wrote another version of this on another thread, but was kindly advised to start my own as I may have more replies. Best wishes to everyone and I do honestly realise there are lots of you worse off than me - Ann xx",

      "Content": "Thanks so much to all of you who replied to me. Thankfully I'm starting to calm down a bit now, and have stopped crying for long enough to get my head together a bit! I went to see the breastcare nurse yesterday who showed me some photos of reconstructions, and who told me I had misunderstood the conversation regarding the date of my surgery - apparently it's not booked yet and the appointment later this week is for measurements etc. if I decide to go ahead. Needless to say I have lots of questions for my surgeon, and thanks for the advice about writing them down, and I am also taking a friend who might be able to stay a bit calmer than me - not difficult lol....... I will have to ask my surgeon about the possibility of radiotherapy, but my understanding is that it's for a very specific area, and my cancer is apparently throughout the ducts - if anything is subsequently discovered in my lymph glands it's more likely to be chemo - just think, no breast and no hair, mmmm (can't believe I am smiling as I write this, but reading some of the letters here have made me realise I don't need to lose my sense of humour as well!) And there are some positive sides, my grown up kids seem to have turned overnight into caring and lovely people, and the rest of my friends and family are being great. If anyone's interested I'll try to let you know how I'm doing - but it's not all about me - it would be great to hear how you all are too. Love, Ann",

      "Content": "Hello everyone, Janet I was interested in your story, and I must admit I find it worrying. I have just had a mastectomy with no spread of the cancer to the lymph nodes. Not only did my consultant say no chemo, but also no radiotherapy or Tamoxifen either. I was under the impression that if there was no lymph node involvement it couldn't spread so I didn't question that - in fact I was happy with the decision. I was also fine with not having radiotherapy - they explained that as everything was gone there would be nothing left to irradiate and it can cause long term damage in some cases to nearby organs, so I was happy with that too. I was slightly surprised about the Tamoxifen as I thought it would protect the other breast. But they said that as I only had micro-invasive DCIS, there was no proof that Tamoxifen or similar would stop me getting it again. It seems in your case that you took the Tamoxifen for 5 years and got it back anyway? Someone I know who took it for 5 years was asked to consider having a hysterectomy at the end of it as a preventative measure as it's linked to uterine cancer. I can understand their argument that you have to weigh up the benefits against the side effects but it's so difficult. May I ask you how you became aware of your secondaries - were you just feeling generally unwell? Also, did your consultant have an explanation as to how this happens if your lymph nodes were fine - did they think there must have been something left behind after your mastectomy? I really hope your treatment helps now, I can understand how you have lost faith in your consultant - I never even saw my oncologist and was told I didn't need any further treatment by his registrar - not very encouraging really. Very best wishes, Ann",
