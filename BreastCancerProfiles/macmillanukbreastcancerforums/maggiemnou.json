I had my surgery January23 this year and was ok until after the radiotherapy, 15 sessions ending April,    Since then I have experienced pain in the operation area which now seems to be getting worse.  I am taking seven cocodomol tablets a day and have a morphine patch and am still very uncomfortable and cant keep a bra on all day.  I suffered from depression too which I got myself through without anti depressants although I take half a lorazapan at night and sometimes a quarter at lunch time if it is bad, I hate taking tablets.  I really thought I would be feeling more normal by now and realise I must get in touch with the breast nurse, I keep hoping it will get better.  I had an appointment with the physio but it really hurt me and I cancelled. Everyone seems to think I am over it so I try to keep a lot of it to myself.  Hugs Maggie",

THEN BOOM!!  we are on our on with our thoughts and it is like delayed action, you cant quite let go.  When I told the oncologist I still had pain in my arm etc., he said  \"it is early days!\" I finished my radiotherapy April 11th and still had the three month check up to go,, but after that (I have been told nine months for next one - which I am querying today)  I think we can only take one day at a time and see how gradually we can come back to something, not as we weere, but good in a different way.  Wheres theres life - theres hope.  Thank you, all you wonderful women out there, you are the only ones who can fully understand, big hugs,, Maggie        ",

      "Content": "When I went back for my first check up after chemo, mx and rads I was told they were very pleased with me and then I mentioned my rib pains.  The oncologist arranged for a scan Just before I was due to go I was phoned and told that as that machine was undergoing modifications - I was to have a PET.  I went back for the results ten days ago and the doctor could not find any results of the scan and we told her it was changed to PET.  She came back and said sorry all was good no cancer, bones, lungs, kidneys etc.  Meanwhile an appointment had been made for me to go to the osteoporosis dept for consultation.  She also couldnt find the scan and then we told her the story and she said she had got it and now I would now need a bone scan.  If on the PET all was well with bones - why do I now need another one?  I want to phone the breast nurse but feel I am being a bit over anxious or stupid.  Have I missed something?  And why did I have a PET if that was not going to show up the condition of my bones.  Also the oncologist told us that my bones were just showing the nomal ageing process. She was a stranger to us as it was so busy we did not have our usual consultant.  Its a case of all the things you mean to say and dont and i  didnt question the osteoporosis nurse.   My next follow up appointment is next May.(for c) I did phone and query that and they said that was how they worked in Addenbrookes once yearly after only one three month one.  I dont know who to speak to, do your bc nurses have all  your details in front of them when you phone - I dont want to be a nuiscance but it is worrying, there seems to be a lack of communication somewhere.  Any ideas or experiences - lovely ladies out there?  All the best and corners up!!  Maggie",

The first time I tried it my arm was more swollen an hour or two after removing it. I phoned the nurse and she said it was not given to me by accident and that I had been measured and to leave it off over the weekend. I have done this and had it in for five hours today and again my arm is more swollen and uncomfortable. I am loath to phone her again and don't know what to do. Her attitude was \"you can't expect it to go down straight away\". I wasn't expecting that anyway and was under the impression that the sleeve was to keep the swelling under control. I would be so grateful t o hear from anyone who has any experience or knowledge about this. Thank you, Maggie",

      "Content": "Thank you SaxxyD and G n J for your posts, it is such a comfort just for someone to be listening to what I am experiencing with this.  I don't know about everyone else but after going for my first check up after treatment had finished last April, I seem to be just adrift and having to cope and manage without any expert advice. I have read the MacMillan pamphlet and have just brought it up again and am going to print it out. Thank you.  Also I have discovered there is a clinic in Snettisham which is quite a distance but worth it, of course, if I can just speak to someone who knows. I have worn the sleeve from 8.30 this morning and have gone about my usual household chores and a bit of pruning ( with gloves) and a going to take it off at meal time this evening as the nurse told me to and see if my arm is more swollen. I have realised that it is not too tight as my fingers are normal so I will see how it is later and if more swollen, I will see the Doctor tomorrow and she if she can refer me to Snettisham, I assume that is the thing to do.   Or, if not, as you say , see if I can find a local practitioner somewhere near. The nurse said the nearest one was fifty miles away and was £50 an hour.  My husband is all for this but I would like to see if I can have it on the NHS if possible.  I am English born here and have never had benefit of any kind in all our working lives.  Sorry, sore point. That is a good idea with the first aid kit, you never know, better safe than sorry.  Thank you SO much for your time and trouble.  All the very best to everyone, Maggie",

      "Content": "Thank you so much for your post SaxxyD it is good to talk to someone who actually knows about this.  As I said my arm swells when I wear the sleeve, I asked the nurse when she fitted the sleeve about the simple massage technique and she says they are not trained for it. This is the University hospital Addenbrookes in Cambridge. When she told me to take it off for the weekend and put in on again on Monday, I couldn't understand what difference that would make, but I did it with the same outcome - my arm was more swollen at the top after an hour or so of removing it.  She said I would have to pay to be taught the simple drainage massage and when I read about it, they say to wear the compression sleeve while the massage is being carried out.  I suppose the best thing I can do is go to my doctor and see what she has to say.  It is not a huge swelling and I wonder does every case justify the sleeve? I would just love to talk to somebody who knows what they are talking about and get on with whatever I have to do.  I have been on the verge of phoning the nurse at the hospital again but I have no confidence in her I am afraid,  My fingers aren't swollen or my wrist just my upper arm, it looks like well developed muscle!!   My common sense tells me my arm should swell more when after I have been wearing it.  I have read so much stuff about it my head is spinning. Once again thank you for answering, I suppose its a case of every patient is different do you think? Maggie ",

I have sent for the dvd on self massage for lymphatic drainage from the Lymphatic Support Group in London and also a stress ball. I have looked at so many sites to find out how to do it, they are mostly the same, so I do what I can and do the excercises as well.  I do not go to the clinic for another four weeks and then I have some more questions that I am going to ask .  I am hoping that there will be more information on the dvd.  My arm does not ache, or hurt and my fingers so not swell, again this info is for anyone who is in the same position as me.  I would love to talk to someone who is. Thanks everyone who answered my original questions, all the very best, Maggie",

I phoned breast nurse at Addenbrookes and have an appointment in two weeks time.  I cant bear a bra on all day and am on morphine patches and 6 or 7 cocodomol tabets a day.  I thought I was never going to hear of anyone else who is having this problem.

I went back for the three month check up and all was ok but I don't go back till May 2014 and I have no medication, is it because I am post menopausal?  I do take pain killers for rib pain which the doctor cant fathom out, I was having this for years before the cancer and had exrays and everything for it.  But why no medication like everybody else, I realise I can ask the nurse but just wondered if anyone else is the same as me?  Take care lovely ladies, this site is such a comfort and support all the very best to you all.

      "Content": "Starting last October I have had chemotherapy, right breast masectomy and then 15 sessions radiotherapy. Went back for the three month appointment and  was told they were very pleased with the treatment but as I had rib pains I was to have a bone scan for osteoporosis. As that machine was under alteration on that day I had a whole body scan with a  different  scanner.  Went back yesterday for the results and was told the good news that my bones were only showing the signs of ageing and that there was no cancer in all vital organs.  I am to go back in May 2014. I am only taking cocodomol now for rib and back pain and half lorazopan at night for sleep. Where does that leave me?  The trouble is that we did not see our usual consultant,, we had a foreign lady that we could hardly understand, there was a lot of confusion abvout the scan and she had to go away and check, before that she had examined me and said there was a problem in my stomach.  When she came back, she said sorry and that I had no signs of cancer.  I still have to go on Tuesday to the osteoporosis dept for consultation. We dont know where we are.  Just wonder if anyone else has experienced this - you have all been so good and there always seems to be someone who can offer advice or suggestions.  Family and friends are all saying \"wonderful, get on with your life now\" but I dont feel like that, I feel sort of bewildered, is this normal?  Is it all in my head?
