    "Content": "Hiya - I had a mastectomy and immediate reconstruction using the LDFlap - the result is fantastic - I'm glad I had it all done at once and my surgeon recommended it rather thank keep putting my body through more surgery. I can understand you wanting a break from it all as you feel your bodys not your own for such a long time with all the treatment . I'm now 4 weeks with my new breast and happy with it just need nipple recon and tattoo and hopefully that will be it. Good luck whatever choice you make.x",
