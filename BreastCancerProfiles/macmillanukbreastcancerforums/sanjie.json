    "Content": "Hi, I read with interest the posts on this forum. I am a nurse & have been for 2 years...prior to this I was a paramedic. Seeing life as a patient has been an eye opening experience! I have been cared for by nurses who have not even passed me the time of day...made worse when they discovered I was a nurse! I kept \"stum\" about being a nurse to prevent this from re happenng & found that when they finally discovered I was a nurse were even worse! One hospital was exceptional & cared for me excellently..I am not saying every nurse was the same but a good few..I initially thought I was being sensitive but my family & colleagues also commented. It was very hard for me to come to terms with this & to try not to get involved & interfere with other patient care..it was exhausting looking out for some of the elderly whilst I was a patient. I had to bite my tongue! It is a very lonely experience being in hospital & at such vulnerable times in our lives. We are taught about holistic care etc but I think it has to come from within..you either have these skills or you don't. Communication is a very important skill..both verbal & non verbal..as is empathy not sympathy..I for one value them all..good luck to you all. Julie",
