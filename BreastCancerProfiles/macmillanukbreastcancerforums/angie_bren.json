    "Content": "I also had awful indigestion, I was really lucky and have a fantastic GP who I could ring if I was having any problems after My chemo sessions. he would write a prescription for me and I would send someone to get them ... My GP gave me Lansoprazole which I was told to take before the indigestion kicked in and they were amazing, I had no more problems with indigestion and lost the urge to eat and drink all the time to ease the pain and so felt a little less restless. You can ask for medication when you see your oncologist if you let them know how awful you felt I hope this is of some help to you XXX",
