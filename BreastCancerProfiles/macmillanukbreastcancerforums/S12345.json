      "Content": "Daydream47 Hi do you mind saying more about your cancer. I have had mastectomy no radio and I don't think I'm going to do chemo. I have been told they may shut down my ovaries but I would just prefer to remove them than have injections. How come you have not had treatments.?  hi there, i am currently on tamoxifen. i chose not to do chemo or radiation for my quality of life. i am a naturalist and believe my immune system is strong. i eat good foods. i had much resistance from my spouse and family but felt it was my choice and life. i was diagnosed with stage 3 breast cancer because i had to have 13 lymphnodes taken out during my unilateral masectomy. i also chose to take out my ovaries because it was hormone receptive. now i just maintain my health with tamoxifen which i have been using for 8 years. not sure if i answered all your questions. thanks",

      "Content": "Hi Day, I decided that i did not want to do chemo or radiation a long time ago because i believed in my natural immunity. I did a unilateral surgery because i was biopsied and only had malignant tumors oneone side so i am lopsided lol. I did not do reconstructive surgery either. It is not for everyone, it was a choice and decision i made on my own without my spouse or family except one family member. I had a very small percentage of living and would be dead in 10 years with the stats. . I am not sure what the orno dx test is?? I took the Brac 1/2 heredity test and made sure it wasnt hereditary. I followed my gut and i had a wonderful doctor who allowed me to choose my own way. My doctor is retiring which i am disappointed about right now but she has recommended another. Sorry, i cant help you much but i know plenty of people that went the traditional route and are survivors. There is no cure for cancer: Marijuana, tumeric, quercetin, asparagus, mangoes, is not a cure.",

      "Content": "Hi there, I wanted to find anyone in this community that has done no chemo and no radiation for breast cancer treatment and wanted to know how it is going and what you are doing?? I think that i am alone and wanted to find anyone else trying to maintain their health like me..... I decided to go my own way. I have a supportive oncologist who has supported my decisions in this.  In 2009 i was diagnosed with breast cancer because i found a pea size lump growing in my right breast that i got biopsied and found that it was malignant. I  have no family history of breast cancer with my mom and three sisters who are all alive with no breast cancer.  A year before that i had a mammogram done because i turned 40 and i feel that it kick started my breast cancer with low immune system and low iron levels but this is all speculation.  I did a unilateral surgery to remove the lump and breast. I have taken my ovaries out because it was hormone receptive.  I am currently on tamoxifen and doing xgeva shots for treatment and see an oncologist every 3 months now.  I would love for anyone here on this sight that knows someone who did no chemo or radiation with breast cancer to please contact me. I would love to have a discussion with you. Thanks!! ",

      "Content": "Hi there, I decided in the beginning that i wanted a good quality of life even if it was going to be a shorter quality of life. I had watched friends who went through chemo and radiation and look like they had their life sucked out of them and i did not want that for myself. I chose to go my own way from the start without the support of my spouse and family members who wanted me to take the traditional route...., i went on my own path, not knowing anything about me or cancer.  I was considered healthy one minute, and then unhealthy the next after i got diagnosed. I chose to have unilateral masectomy surgery on my right breast and to take tamoxifen as my way of maintaining my health.  I looked into all sorts of natural ways but found no solution and none that seemed to have great results. My doctor wanted me to take tamoxifen if i was not going to do anything else at all so i did do that from reoccurring. The statistics say i will be dead in 10 years and i am determined to live a long life. It is a hard decision and everyone needs to choose what is right for themself. I call it maintaining my health and that is what i do everyday.",
