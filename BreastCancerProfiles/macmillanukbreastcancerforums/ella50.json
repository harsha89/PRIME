Booked a holiday flying out to Egypt on 3rd November for a week in the sun - need to try & lose a bit of this weight before I go. It certainly helps with the SE's to share & hear other peoples experiences.  In October I am doing a course called Breast Cancer Moving Forward run by Breast Cancer Care which my consultant thinks will help with understanding the fatigue as this is the thing I struggle with most - eyes closing as I type.

When it gets me down and it does, as I feel half the person I was before - I remember that my oncologist offered sympathy re the side effects but said \"Elaine you are on a wonderful drug\" and this is what pulls mw through.  E x",

Maybe you should say to your sister that she should try walking in your shoes and see how it feels - this journey is difficult enough without dealing with people who can't or won't believe that fatigue is an ongoing issue.

I already have arthrtis in both knees but worse on left & it became quite unstable & much sorer just before Christmas - it was while getting results of X ray I plucked up the courage to ask for Femara.  I could cope with knee pain that has been ongoing for a couple of years (thanks to my hillwalking I fear) if my SE's were less.  I will post back results in a month or so.
