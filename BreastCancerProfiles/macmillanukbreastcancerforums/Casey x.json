    "Content": "Hello Everyone, I wonder if someone can help me. Ive had trouble flushing my mums PICC line this evening, blood wouldnt draw back either, and i didnt wanna apply too much pressure. Im such a worrier as now, we have had to leave it, I feel that she will get an infection and it will be my fault!! Has this ever happened to you if youve had a PICC and is there anything to worry about? Or anything I can do?",
