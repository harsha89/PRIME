      "Content": "Thanks Dorothee , unfortunately my BC nurse not available until after new year , haven't found her terribly helpful so far anyway , my skin reacted fiercely to the opt site dressing and she was flippant about the blisters and broken areas then  !!! as a retired Community Nurse myself I've found her attitude poor , I do hope I've never made light of any patients problems in the past !!!. I just wondered if anybody else has ever experienced this . Your journey has been tougher than mine , maybe I'm just a whimp ?H Having a VERY simple Xmas and it's been stress free so far .   I hope you're having a good xmas good , many thanks for you reply , it's my first time for posting and I appreciate you taking the time to answer me. June xo",
