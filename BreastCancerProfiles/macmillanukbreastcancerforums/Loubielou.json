      "Content": "Hi I too developed a fear/phobia to having my chemo last time and also could taste it as well as the nausea as soon as I started having it The cold cap I chose not to have it anymore after my 2nd chemo as I felt it just prolonged the amount of time I was at hospital for and made me feel worse  I ended up going for hypnotherapy at the hospital to help and it did as it taught me how to cope with having chemo and being able to sort of hypnotise myself whilst having the chemo plus also eating mints whilst having the chemo helped with the taste I got in my mouth Which now I am back 11years on having chemo again has been very helpful and I've had no problems but I have got a picc line this time which I insisted on as I think the cannula was a big issue last time which I did not realise until after I had finished all my treatment last time  Hope this is of some help to you  Lisa xx",

      "Content": "Hi, I also got cording following my mastectomy, it is very much like everybody else says stretching and massaging I found that if I stretched my arm up as high and straight as I could then felt in my arm pit I could feel the cording then I gently massaged that area till it eased a bit, then repeated this throughout the day and eventually over time it went, but it's one of those things that you have to be consistent in doing or you keep going back to square one  Hope that helps a little Lisa x",

      "Content": "I opted for bilateral mastectomy, I knew their was always a small risk of recurrence , what I didn't realise is that with the scar tissue from the reconstruction it would be very difficult to feel until it had spread to other areas I don't regret my decision for bilateral and reconstruction but once you've had that done you no longer go for mammograms and have to rely on your manual examination every month to detect any changes  Lisa",
