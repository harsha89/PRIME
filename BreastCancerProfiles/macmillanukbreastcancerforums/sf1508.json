      "Content": "Some interesting reading here :-)   I have just had a mastectomy & at the same time I was fitted with a temporary implant, think it is going to be temporary for a long time. My surgeon's plan is to do the reconstruction taking it from my tummy which I am in favour of over taking it from my back.  Has anybody here had a reconstruction made from their tummy ?",

      "Content": "Hi Jane, I found what you said here very interesting.  From when I got diagnosed in August I have tried to be good & eat well but failed miserably!  After today's news that they cant tell me if my radiotherapy has been affective I am re thinking about what I should & should not be eating. Sammy99, I totally understand what you say here too, I've a little devil on my shoulder telling me just the same thing, life being too short etc etc :-) xx ",

      "Content": "Hi Gina,   I am also new here.  I was diagnose with breast cancer on the 8th August & things moved fast.  I had a mastectomy on the 20th Aug & am still very sore, stiff & in pain.  I was fitted with a temp implant but it is still hard & tends to be quite swollen out at the side under my arm.  I get stinging sensations & nipple soreness which is frustrating since its no longer there, phantom pains.  To those that have gone through similar, is this normal ? Radio therapy starts shortly which is am uncertain about but know its hopefully a means to an end. Good luck Gina & to everyone here, its good to know that this place is here xx ",
