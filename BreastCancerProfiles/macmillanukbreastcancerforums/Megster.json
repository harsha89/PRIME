      "Content": "Yes - I had my first mammogram post surgery, chemo and radiotherapy today - I was very scared but in fact didn't find it painful, much to my surprise!!  Can't believe a year has gone by and what a difference in how I feel in just a few months after treatment ended.  My hair is growing back and I feel stronger every day.  Not to say I won't worry about results and seeing surgeon for review but for everyone at the beginning or in the middle of this - the time does pass, honestly  You will feel better and you will get through it somehow.   Good luck with results Maggie - lets both try not to worry too much xx Incidentally- is anyone else on UNIRAD trial?  I would like to hear about other's experiences please.  ",

      "Content": "Hi Skye01 I was really upset by your post, especially your Uncle suggesting foster care for your young one.  I do think you should think about showing your family this thread perhaps.  I have been and am very lucky with my family and their support and have still found things difficult at times because this is a difficult road we are travelling. I am full of admiration for you managing to cope while you are caring for a baby and having the strength to recognise when you do need help.  Please phone Macmillan and ask what support might be available for you, and like many others have said here, remember good friends can step in and help.  Some of them are probably desperate to help and just waiting to be asked.  Use your energy up for you and your baby, you are the two that are important right now.  I really hope things get better for you, lots of love to you. x",

      "Content": "Hi All, There does seem to be a mismatch between recommendation from NICE and reality.  I went on Letrozole in February and was put on a waiting list for a \"baseline\" Dexa scan.  I got a letter saying the waiting list was up to a year, I now have an appointment for early November so in fact was 9 months. For me personally I put it on the backburner because I am having chemotherapy so I came off Letrozole and will restart once I have finished chemo.  However, we didn't know this at the time so I would have had nine months on a drug that could cause bone thinning. So I could not understand how any results would be baseline, as surely any potential damage could already have started?  It would be interesting to find out other people's experience of waiting times for this are.  ",

      "Content": "Well done Judy58 that sounds like a really positive way forward. I wanted to add my thoughts to this discussion.  When I was first diagnosed two very good friends took me out to dinner and offered to shave their heads in solidarity.  This made me feel very uncomfortable and I wasn't sure why.  I thought about it and read this post later and realised what it was that I couldn't articulate at the time.  I told both of them that I would prefer that they didn't take this drastic step and explained why and they were both very relieved because they didn't want to do it but felt that it was almost obligatory these days, ie. 'if you don't shave your hair you don't care' and I think sometimes these campaigns do that; there is an element almost of cooercian.   Now I'm not blaming Macmillan for that, I can see that they simply don't want to lose much needed funding and if people are doing it anyway then they want a share of that.  They are a fantastic organisation and the further down the road of this treatment I travel the more I appeciate the terrific job they do.  However, this has lacked a bit of sensitivity. When I shaved my head it definitely was not fun, I just went and did it myself because I wanted to keep it low key for my childrens' sake. It was very hard to show them the result but they were amazing and my youngest daughter still likes to stroke the bit of fuzz I have left. I'm getting used to me now but it was hard to go from having long brown hair to short white stubble.  But I have some nice scarves and i'm picking up a new wig next week, though I'll probably not wear it very much this summer. Anyway, the long and short of it, keep up your good work Macmillan but please listen to us about this.  Let's concentrate on getting to people to fundraise by doing fun things which hopefully will be good for their health too.",

      "Content": "I was really really nervous  and anxious about going for a bra fitting too. I had surgery in April then delayed healing (a mammoplasty and reduction on other side) and none of my old bras fitted.  I eventually plucked up the courage and went to John Lewis for a fitting and the assistant was lovely, they are trained for post surgery fitting and she was very kind and empathetic. I got two non underwired bras and a wired one and in fact I find the wired one the most comfortable, it's one of those t-shirt slightly padded/moulded ones.  Admittedly I only wear it when I am out and as soon as I am home I'm back into my cheapo Sainsbury's TU stretchy pull on bras.  If you are not too far away I would recommend making an appointment at JL's, it's not as bad as you will be imagining and you will hopefully find something comfortable for you. ",

I think that I started wearing the Sainburys bra tops as soon as I was healed, ie. when I didn't need dressing changes.  In my case this took about 10 weeks but this was an unusually long time I believe.  It might be different for you with implants though, do you have to wear front fastening for a while to keep the shape?  I'm sure someone else on this site will know.

      "Content": "Hi Tetleysscooby, Your circumstances sound so similar to mine, I'd noticed dimpling, which I thought were stretch marks and ignored for months, then finally found a lump in January, which actually was quite large.  Don't know how i missed it!  I was referred to breast clinic, seen within 2 weeks and diagnosed on the day, with three lumps too.  I too had gone on my own because I was told the results would be given the following week.  To say I was in shock is an understatement.  It's hard to remember those early days now, but rest assured things do get better and you will come to accept what is ahead of you.  It isn't easy but the time passes and milestones are ticked off and it will change us, I believe ultimately for the better when all this is over, though it's hard to see that now I know. In the meantime, focus on you and your family.  Do what you feel is right for you.  Eat well, get exercise, do exactly what you feel like doing.  I wish you all the best and hope that all your treatment, whatever it may be, goes well.  I'm due to finish all treatment by early December and boy I cannot wait.  And before you know it you too will have an end date in mind and something to work towards, because it is hard at times  But we get through it, I promise you.  ",
