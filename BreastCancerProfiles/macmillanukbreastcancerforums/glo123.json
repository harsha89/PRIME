My tadte buds are gone and the only thing I was eating was really strong cheese as this seemed to coat my mouth. Someone told me pinnapple would help kick back the taste buds but I got a mouth ulcers for I could give that a go maybe you could  . Enjoy your tea. Gloria  ",

      "Content": "I didnt make it home before I started and ended back in hospital twice so ring them sooner rather than later as you will need fluids down you. I didnt have morning sickness so wasnt expecting it as I had heard same as you I just we are all different and thats it. If you can eat do it little and often and I find soup is great or you just end up eating biscuits and rubbish. Hope this helps I am waiting for my 2nd lot next week and crossing my fingers not the same as before. Gloria    ",
