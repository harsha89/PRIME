    "Content": "Jen, I have just read your post and having gone through breast cancer myself your husband/partner should be giving you the support you need, that's very insensitive of him.  If you can't get any support from him go to a friend because you need somebody.  If the shoe was on the other foot it would be a very different case because YOU would support him!. Chin up because you WILL get through this x All the best.",
