      "Content": "Hi Mary, Thank you for your advice, I hope this reply comes to you, I am having problems working out how to use this site!!! I am having a flap taken from my tummy, but without using any muscle.  I was diagnosed in February with dcis.  Unfortunately my surgeon has not been able to remove all the unfriendly cells,  My only option now is a mastectomy, but I am having to wait till 26 July for the op.  I have been reading the messages on here and have only recently plucked up the courage to ask a question.  Comfort will be fine with me, I will have a look at the bra you have recommended. Hope your recovery is going well. Carol    ",
