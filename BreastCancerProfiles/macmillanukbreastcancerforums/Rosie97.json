    "Content": "The script fan, firstly thank you for your kindness in answering my posts as a newbie on this site. Other people eh? I've already been told by well meaning friends that I should have a double mastectomy and also that breast cancer is nothing these days. I wish you well for next week and hope the radiotherapy isn't too gruelling.
