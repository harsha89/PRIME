    "Content": "Hi Lucy, When I was diagnosed last May, I was terrified. I did not have a lump but had discharge from my nipple which turned blood coloured. It turned out that I had Ductal carcinoma and Ductal carcinoma in situ. I had to have a mastectomy, then 8 weeks later 6 cycles of FEC-T chemo and 15 sessions of radiotherapy. All this treatment finished just under 2 months ago. Throughout this time I too have felt panic and despair as to what the future holds. However, from my surgery to the end of my treatment, I have wonderfully been looked after by the medical team in charge of my care. I've also had great support from my husband and daughter, whom without I would have given up. Everyone involved in your illness will take good care of you. I was always kept informed as to what was going to happen and why. Any worries would be addressed and solved where possible, there and then. You've just got to try and go with it, be gentle on yourself and be a bit selfish if you need to. Be as brave as you can and take all the help and support that is offered to you. Also, Lucy, it's okay to feel like you do, it's a scary time, try not to beat yourself up about it. I hope you get the answers you seek tomorrow, if you're not sure of something just ask them. Let's hope your treatment starts soon, so that at least something is being done. I'll be thinking of you, if you feel up to it, it would be good to know how thing's went. Take care my lovely Janine x",
