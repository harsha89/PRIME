      "Content": "Hi NiceCuppa, So sorry you've had to endure such a thoughtless comment - no you're not super-sensitive, the nurse is insensitive and, like you said, has zero people skills. Also wanted to pick up on your 'constant hindrance' feeling - no, you're not the hindrance, that label belongs to cancer and all the crap that it entails, painful procedures, treatments which, though life-saving, wreak havok with your body and mind - none of this was your choice. Re nursey, in her clumsy way I guess she was making conversation, unaware of the implications of what she had said. No excuse at all, just that she probably didn't mean to harm - doesn't make it any better, and it highlights the inadequacy of proper training at that hospital. A nurse should simply know better than that.  In terms of going back to that hospital, I have seen suggestions on other threads re changing hospitals - don't know if that is an option for you, isn't a possibility for everyone re distances, accessibility etc, but might be worth considering. It's horrible to feel terrified of the place that is supposed to be restoring you to health.  I wonder if it's worth speaking to a nurse on this site? I have only spoken to a work advisor re my phased return to work (bear this in mind for later), and she was very kind and helpful.  Hope someone is supporting you today, sounds like you need a nice cuppa with a good friend.....Hugs, HFxx",

I get the odd twinge in my left wrist, difficult to know if it's anything to do with them, but really I seem to be doing fine. I haven't heard of Kisqali, is it another tablet?  Re arm, I have some numbness and sort of inner carpet burn type sensation on the inside of my upper arm and to the side of my armpit, but that's since the sentinel node sampling - nerve damage I think from other posts.  Am sure others who've been on nasties for longer will also pop in before long.

      "Content": "Hi Tray46, sorry you're going through this turmoil and glad that at least tomorrow you will have a better idea of what lies ahead. Lovely messages already, I just wanted to pick up on the work issue. I had my lumpectomy and node sampling last week of October, did the usual random googling re 'time off for a lumpectomy' and came up with 2 weeks. Duly expected that would be me. After the op, realised the wound was far bigger than a previous lumpectomy for what turned out to be a benign lump, started thinking 2 weeks maybe unrealistic. I wasn't under any pressure except from....ME. Like you, always thinking of others, never off sick, worrying about work. Thankfully I had the sense to post here and lovely ladies swooped in with their stories, so I plucked up the courage to ask for longer. GP signed me off for a further month. Fast forward to eventual oncology appointment, the staff there signed me off for another 2 months to cover radiotherapy. I finished rads last week, am a bit red and sore as well as tired so now do not expect to go back till after half term. Unbelievable, given what I thought at the beginning. BUT I am not skiving, my 'work' is to do my utmost to heal both my body and my mind. I eat well (mostly), go for long walks (mostly) and rest if I need to. I am learning to say no to things I don't want to do or feel won't help me.  Please please give yourself permission to take the time YOU need. We're all different, some folk here have worked through much of their treatment, some because they had to ( I know I'm fortunate in having a supportive employer) and some because they feel that's best for them. Myself, I know I simply have not been ready to go back, physically or emotionally.  Wishing you good luck for tomorrow and sending lots of gentle hugs. HFxx",

      "Content": "Hi Mazzie5, just caught up with this thread, had a week away and can't believe how much activitiy there was here, managed to keep up with a couple of threads on my phone, but mostly had to wait till bck on a laptop! Just thought I'd wish you well for your rads starting soon, and also add my experience re lifts. As others have said, people cope differently and some work throughout. In my case, I was lucky to be able to be signed off during and after rads, I teach in a special school and it's a very physical job. And the distnces involved would have meant I'd have barely been there anyway. But I know I'm lucky to have that sort of sickness cover. Regarding lifts, I wanted to drive myself for the first week or so, a sort of maintaining independence kind of feeling, but was very happy to accept offers of lifts for the last week, even though I could have driven. The lifts made the later visits more of a social thing, I took the 'driver' for coffee at the hospital cafe and had a couple of stop offs at garden centres on the return journeys. And it was something that friends, who'd offered 'help' at my initial diagnosis time, could actually do. It felt like the nearest thing for any of them to 'share' in my treatment. 3 different friends helped so it spread the load. So my advice would be, take any offers of lifts towards the end, I definitely appreciated the support.  lesleyhelen's aadvice re drinking lots I'd also echo, it's something I'm having to try to watch now I'm back at work (on phased return) as it's tricky to keep up but definitely makes a massive difference. Good whilst on hormone therapy too, with its effects on urinary areas!! Wishing you well for next week! Sooner you start, sooner you'll be ringing the bell! Gentle hugs, HFxx",

I'm keeping an eye on both meet up threads (Birmingham and Scotland) but not stating any preferred dates because I don't feel I can say definitely till nearer the time. I very much hope to make it to one of them. I live just north of London so Birmingham is doable in a day, while Scotland is a reasonably frequent destination as I'm an exiled Scot! So if possible I'd combine a meet up there with a family/ friends visit.  There are probably a few others like me, lurking in the sidelines just monitoring the situation!

Yes it\u2019s such a shock, a cancer diagnosis, I know I was half expecting it when I found my lump but was still secretly hopeful that it would just be another cyst. Good that you have great support, but hard too as it is so painful seeing your family suffer alongside you. I think that\u2019s where this site comes in, we can share as much or as little as we want, and people here \u2018get it\u2019 in a way that is hard for our families and friends to. And sometimes we find we can share more here as we\u2019re not trying to \u2018shield \u2018 people close to us.  My cancer was also invasive ductal, different receptors so different treatment plan, but similar  old poop in the end! There\u2019s a \u2018Triple Negative \u2018 group which you may already have found and lots of other triple negative folk in this group. Also threads here for chemo and radiotherapy.  Glad you have found your way here, keep posting and let us know how you get on once it all starts .

I agree about the shock of the scar, I'd had a previous lumpectomy for what turned out to be a benign fibroadenama, and the scar is tiny, about the length of my thumbnail. Whereas my lumpectomy/ sentinel node sampling scar is the length of my index finger plus the knuckle (I like a real life comparison!) - quite a shocker when I saw it at the first dressing change. Glad all is well, and great they've encouraged you to go back if any concerns, I found the BC nurses very helpful and accessible which was particularly welcome in the early post op days when you just don't know what is 'ok' and 'normal' Happy healing!

I think I googled (dangerous) 'recovery after lumpectomy' and something popped up saying 2 weeks. Also, I had a lumpectomy 13 years ago to remove what turned out to be a fibroadenoma and I did recover very quickly, particularly after I got the results and knew it was benign! But this time around is of course completely different and I think I naively just didn't stop to think about how very different - lumpectomy and wide local excision and sentinel node biopsy, all far more invasive than a straightforward lumpectomy. Add the worry about effects of further treatment and the coming to terms with having cancer - totally different ball game.  Anyway I'm so grateful for the replies and encouragement, I've also had 2 lovely emails from managers at work (I am a special needs teacher, hence the moving and handling aspects of my job) completely supporting further time at home.

Like many folk here, I found the waiting the worst, things felt better once treatment began - like you I started with lumpectomy and sentinel node sampling. It's a horrible sort of limbo time, between diagnosis and the operation. I tried to focus on practical things like getting stuff sorted at work for while I'd be off (though in my case I underestimated ridiculously how long I would be off!) Mainly stay away from Dr Google, lots of alarming and often out of date stuff out there.

I think I am fine for sick leave luckily, and I am coming round to the notion of taking plenty of time rather than the bare minimum. I am the 'carry on regardless' type who never takes time off so it's a new experience, actually recognising that I should put myself first. And my team at work have coped fine over the last 2 weeks so there's no reason to hurry back.  You're so right about the treatment plan, I'm really impatient to get the details and dates. At the follow up appointment with the surgeon last week the original diagnosis from the initial biopsy was confirmed, and sentinel lymph nodes were thankfully negative, so it seems I'll have radiotherapy and hormone treatment. But that was all that was said, it's now a wait to hear when I'll see the oncologist, and from then, dates and which hormone treatment I'll be offered. It kind of feels as if it's all lost its momentum, I want that plan! I haven't been able to see my GP yet re extending my sick note, the surgery was a doctor down on friday so only seeing emergencies, but I'll follow it up tomorrow. I found an old thread on this site re going back to work but haven't been able to find it again so thought I'd start this one and get some advice. Thanks and hugs! xxx",

      "Content": "Hi AnnJac, glad you have a date, good to get on with it! All of it's scary but always seems better to have definite dates and plans. Like GRANNY59 I had lumpectomy and node sampling and definitly found front opening everything was easier. I lived in rediscovered loose shirt tops for a couple of weeks post op as I found pulling stuff over my head hurt. And I bought shirt type night wear (cheap from TKMaxx) as again much easier with front opening. Most of my warmer tops are zip up or button up anyway as easier to cool off during menopause so these have come back in use again too! Hugs and good wishes, hope you can have lots of cafe visits while doing your pre-op shopping. NNxx",

Like AnnJac I knew that first day of tests that they considered it to be cancer, but had previous experiences of cysts and other benign lumlps, some of which needed to be removed before we could know for sure that they were nothing to worry about. One thing is for sure, you will know more about the beast tomorrow, even if not the whole nature of it. Will be thinking of you and wishing you a speedy journey to some answers. HFxxx",

I had a similarly tortuous set of investigations 14 years ago - visit to GP, referral, examination at hospital ('a suspicious lump'), mammogram at another hospital, back for results (inconclusive), ultrasound and needle aspiration, further wait for results (atypical cells), core biopsy, another wait (inconclusive), eventually a lumpectomy, wait for results - benign.....Just ridiculous.  Can only echo others' suggestions - keep busy, no googling, try to keep in mind that the majority of lumps and bumps are not cancer.

      "Content": "Hi Feb59, and welcome to this lovely online club, lots of support and shared experiences here as well as a great place to rant and rave if necessary! I've been on 'nasty' tabs/ Anastrozole for 2 months, so not that long, but no problems so far. Many ladies here have been on it for much longer, I'm sure some will pop in. I take it after or with my breakfast along with a glass of water and also drink lots throughout the day, a habit I developed in preparation for rads. The only thing I think I've suffered so far is a bit of a twinge now and then in my wrist.  I'm also trying to follow a healthier lifestyle, doing lots of walking as I also worry re the bone thinning effects. Definitely ask for a DEXA scan - I had one mid-January but won't get results till my next oncologist appointment in April unless it shows anything untoward - I'm assuming now that no news is good news as nothing heard.  I don't know the pros and cons of different aromotase inhibitors, I was given Anastrozole following lumpectomy/ sentinel node sampling and alongside 3 weeks of rads in January. But the oncologist did say that if I didn't get on with it I should come back to discuss other options, As I've been fine I've just kept popping the pills! Good luck with your discussions and decisions - I know just what you mean by damned if you do and damned if you don't - all we can do is try to make informed choices as best we can. HFxx",

      "Content": "Hi Beautiful4 Welcome to the crazy but comforting cancer club, nobody joins willingly but I know I'm very glad it's here.  Am assuming that you've had biopsies done already? In which case hopefully you have more information about your cancer which would help your research. My cancer is also Oestrogen positive and HER2 negative, so ours are similar, but from my very limited experience it's difficult to make generalisations without more details. So mine is Invasive Ductal Carcinoma or IDC but there are lots of other types, some invasive and some non-invasive. Do you know which yours is? Once you do, searching on this site can be very helpful. I've been careful to resist the temptation to google too widely. In my case, I've had the cancer itself removed, good riddance, and will have radiotherapy soon. I've just started on hormone therapy because of the oestrogen positive/ER+  nature of the beast. But this is all to do with my particular case, you really need to know what type, size, grade and stage you have or might have before trying to guess what you might be facing in terms of treatment. Have you been given any idea of a possible treatment plan yet? I'm sure you'll get lots of information and support here, and don't forget to ask, ask, ask questions, I've found the breast cancer nurses very approachable and helpful.  Welcoming hugs, NNxx",

I haven't gone far today compared to the rest of the week, weather is squally and grim. I did manage a major accomplishment though - walked the dog myself for the first time in ages. She's generally good on the lead but may lunge in response to sighting small furries (cats, squirrels, rabbits) so I worry about her pulling the 'bad' arm. Braved it today just for short walk in between the showers, and she was good as gold. Just round little local park, but it's a start! hope tomorrow is brighter....",

Lovely walk in the end but what a contrast to Monday - no blue sky in sight, though thankfully no rain. A heron flew by very close, so beautiful, I love their long legs trailing behind; then on the heath Fantastic Mr Fox turned up!

I liked their use of the tickling feather! And I also like that you found it in your knicker drawer! ronstar I am very impressed with your swimming lessons, I am a hopeless swimmer and never put my head in the water. And like you I love going in the sea (though not far out) but hate all aspects of swimming pools. Well done! I didn't know it's good for lymphodema, I actually thought it wasn't good to do too much breaststroke? (the only stroke I can do) Took myself for a walk at last, feel like I've been cooped up since Monday (worked Tuesday and also Wednesday from midday). Set off after meeting friend for cafe lunch (should really have walked first but was too busy being lazy this morning). Such a lovely afternoon. Hope all have enjoyed this weather in some way or other. HFxx",

It's becoming a happy habit, can't bear the thought of full time work! Having said that, was so exhausted yesterday after my first Monday at work for several months, I know I am nowhere near ready for full time work anyway. I will do some work from home this afternoon but that is nothing like actually being in school. We managed to get to the town in the cold but no rain, but the homeward walk was wet to say the least! Nice weather for ducks as they say! Not great photos but the blossom looked lovely in the flesh.... hope others have managed a stroll today without getting drenched! HFxx",

AnnJac you must be heartily sick of this whole dressings/ healing/ not healing business, I feel like shouting 'enough already!!!' on your behalf, but who to? The glimmer of hope, I take it, is the comment 'well granulated'? But 12 weeks is just too long, you must be so longing to get started (and finished) with your radiotherapy but all held up by lack of healing. I really hope the latest regime proves to be the winner for you.  The sun has started shining here too about an hour after a walk to local garden centre. Misty walk, weather a bit drizzly, but the highlight was seeing what we thought at first was a lonely swan without a mate, then got closer.... Great site for a nest, I hope, as nothing can get near. Very nice tea and therapeutic scone (thought of you, AnnJac) at the cafe. HFxx",

Not helped by being put on 4x daily antibiotics for possible infection (red, swollen apparently hot boob so given penicillin at oncology follow up last week, but at breast clinic today they think it's after effects of radiotherapy - that makes sense to me) - had to be taken on empty stomach so got in the way of tea and scones and generally complicated arrangements. AnnJac, so glad there's finally a plan which sounds like it should sort out your ongoing healing issues - keeping everything crossed for you. And so exciting about the Palace garden party, must be very therapeutic getting ready for such a fab event.  moomy, Henry the puppy is sooooo cute! I bet he's hard work but what a sweet pup! Love the bluebells , Amalie, spotted a few today on a lovely afternoon walk. Also a field full of mums and calves, and a coot on its nest, don't know whether it can be seen as the light wasn't great... Great weather for next few days I think, hope everyone gets to enjoy it in some way. HFxx",

That wisteria is so pretty Violetsniff, and so well in flower. Where I walked with a friend today, there was a wisteria tunnel which will be fantastic when it is properly in flower but at the moment nothing like as far ahead as yours. And Amalie that soup looks just delicious. AnnJac so sorry you are confined to quarters, it's just been too long, I so hope the graft works and you can get on with your life. You are always so helpful to us all here, it's time things started going right for you. It's so frustrating when you just want to get on with the radiotherapy and get it done, yet are 'stuck' for now until some proper healing begins. Keeping my fingers firmly crossed that next week brings good news. The walk today was lovely, walked out of town to the grounds of a 'stately home', very nice understated and unfussy gardens as well as a rather posh cafe - we sat outside on a bench in the courtyard as we had the dog with us, it was so peaceful and quiet. I guess a Tuesday morning isn't peak time! A couple of slightly 'hairy' moments, firstly when the resident cat appeared, luckily in the distance (dog not keen on small furries) and then when post people arrived (she's also not fond of a high-vis vest or anyone in uniform) but managed to divert her attention each time! The photos are of a dither of ducklings (no idea what the proper collective term is, quite like the sound of a dither) on a little 'lake'and the view from our bench.  Good luck to all getting out for walks or in the garden in this fine weather.

Fingers crossed for tomorrow.  Managed my favourite walk to next town today with lovely friend who I haven't seen since February. Had so much to catch up on, only took one photo! Lunch in cafe, thicnk we were there for 3 hours! The sun was shining on return journey, sadly meant the midges were in full swarm so dodged off the canal path when we could to more open ground.

Then a short break before my second fast track lesson and I'm good to go! Hoping to manage a couple of classes each week after that, and have also been given the all clear to go swimming (not so keen but was another recommendation for breast lymphoedema).  Couldn't take photos during the walk but had to go on to another town for travel vaccination advice and found a duck family to photograph.... off to bonny Scotland tomorrow for a few days so will hopefully have some photos to share along the way!

      "Content": "Wonderful photos, love snowdrops and their namesake! puzzler it absolutely does not ruin the walk, that you had a pub lunch! Much better to walk and eat than just sit around. Now me in last couple of days, minimal walking and 2 lunches out - not at all virtuous - but good company which is food for the soul so I think that counts for a lot.  AnnJac wish we could all descend on the hospital and spring you out, it could be the charge of the wonky boob brigade! But sadly I think you need to be there till all is healed enough to be homeward bound - may that day come very soon. We all love your news and photos, keep them coming and keep circuiting. Love and many many gentle hugs, NNxx",

I've had a lazy day so didn't get out till dusk, but the bonus of walking then was that a little muntjac deer crossed my path, we usually only see them first thing in the morning or early evening. No chance to take a photo, and the light was no good anyway. Decent walk round and up country lane then extra for luck just round houses, back via shop. Garden centre date tomorrow morning so will have to do lots of window shopping to clock up some steps, maybe a proper walk in the afternoon....HFxxx",

Haven't managed any decent walks this week yet, just into town and back (with lunch in between) yesterday, then round garden centre today (with inevitable cafe visit) BUT finally got to an afternoon yoga class. Really enjoyed it (hope I'm still that positive tomorrow, don't think I did anything too strenuous) so will hopefully become a habit. Haven't done yoga since I was pregnant with my son and he's now 25!!! Return to work is going to be a serious obstacle but if I can hopefully get some sort of phased return then I can fit in yoga on a non-work day, at least for a while.  Walk planned with friend and dog tomorrow so will try to take some photos!",

How will I do this again soonish??) so I just do a circuit of steep long set of steps through a wooded area and off round the streets.  That was meant to show view from the steps of the crescent moon behind a tree, instead it's mainly a wall and a street light. Oh well I'll keep trying! And hopefully walk in daylight before the week is out. Happy walking all! NNxx",

Firstly, great walking everybody, especially impressed with AnnJac, increasing steps by the thousand, despite all your horrible setbcks - you truly are an inspiration! Also WhatHappened, I remember your posts when you could barely face stepping out and now you're striding out, just shows what determination can achieve. Before I forget, I had a similar experience with getting repeat prescription of Anastrozole, AnnJac - first time, nothing through from hospital so oncology nurse arranged second month supply and I collected it from the hospital pharmacy, could this be possible for you for now? For 3rd month's supply I took the hospital letter to the surgery and they then issued the prescription. I finally saw one of the GPs 2 weeks ago to discuss ongoing issues and phased return to work, this was my first consultation since original referral in September. It seems impossible to make an appointment even weeks in advance, in the end I just went to the daily 'drop-in' clinic where you go on the day and wait (I thought that was meant for emergencies but couldn't see any other way!) My latest repeat prescription I just ordered online, we have that system once it's established. Don't let your tablets run out before you speak to your GP, I'm sure either the hospital or surgery have to arrange your next month's supply one way or another. Leolady56, so sorry you're feeling cast adrift, Sunnyone your comments in response were so apt. I haven't 'got there' yet, it still feels quite early days for me, I think I more feel a bit shell shocked by it all so kind of plod along, not thinking about it too much, haven't really got any idea yet what my new normal is. Hey ho this post is already rather long, sorry if I've rambled on, hope most people have enjoyed today's sunshine one way or another! Hugs to all, HFxx",

      "Content": "Fab photo Violetsniff, I too adore trees, I think they could tell us such amazing stories if only they could talk (of course maybe they do but we don't understand them....) On the way back yesterday we passed a fabulous old oak tree which is apparently 800 plus years old! A bit decrepit and split in sections but still standing and still growing in its own unique and rather haphazard fashion. Thanks for the back to work good wishes! No proper walking today apart from a few streets to and from the car to school. Journey there was horrendous (nearly 2 hours), colleagues were lovely and of course the students are a delight, but I feel totally wiped out, thank goodness I am off tomorrow. I am so glad the GP said to try 2 days to start as I'd never have asked for it. Dinner then bed I think....hopefully a decent walk tomorrow. HFxx",

Lovely trees and lots of birds singing, there were 2 for joy in this tree but probably can't make them out....  AnnJac I am glad the consultant had a look but sorry you're having these troubles, may you have many mini walks involving pubs and cafes, and enjoy being cosy at home.

Sitting now with a cup of tea and am quite happy not to get up again today! Not the loveliest of walks, nice destination (garden centre out in the country) but variable routes, some in countryside and by rivers but others along a busy road.

When I became n.nala instead of the full fat version it didn't really mean anything (it was a reference to my dog before, my son sent me a get well card with her on the front in what I thought was a nurses' hat but on closer inspection turned out to be a doctors'!). So in honour of the first anniversary of Walking Back to Happiness, I've been renamed HappyFeet1 (the number was necessary as someone got there before me, rats).  I'll add a bit in my signature to explain I guess.  Not got out for walk yet, too busy sorting naughty washing machine (snap Leolady56, I taught the repairer's kids so had nice catch up!) and eating toast.

Much of the way back is a towpath, we had a near miss with a cyclist but to be fair he was very apologetic and he wasn't actually going that fast.

Hope a gallop, or even a gentle canter, through the village will blow some of the week's cobwebs away.  Beautiful weather here too, hopefully photos later. Hugs, HFxxx",

I loved your lone poppy too Violetsniff, and can picture you walking along that country road in your Easter bonnet like one of the Flower Fairies \u200d♀️ do you remember them?! You definitely got your steps in that day, glad it was all lovely once you got there. moomy, I agree all exercise is good, all that load bearing stuff with the washing, and plenty of movement with gardening, bet you felt the effects afterwards!  Have been inexplicably exhausted since coming back from my mini break in Scotland, maybe a week on antibiotics has done it? Haven\u2019t had any since I had a quinsy 18 years ago! Maybe I\u2019m super sensitive now, who knows, and after all that the breast clinic think I\u2019ve got lympheodema in the beast from radiotherapy, not an infection at all... which makes more sense to me. Anyhoo have appointment with lympho nurse next week so hopefully some exercises to help reduce it!  Lovely walk yesterday, and met my nephew in Kings Cross the day before so a country scene and a city one: Hope everyone can enjoy this glorious weather while it lasts HFxx",

Can feel it now, the instructor did say that it really gets your upper body working (which is why it's been recommended to me for breast lymphoedema). Anyhoo I've signed up for a fast track course starting next thursday, eek!! I think it's going to be the perfect exercise for me, I love walking anyway and it's all in a beautiful park. Just no opportunity for taking photos, that'll have to be for my more leisurely non-Nordic walks. And there's even a session with Tai Chi thrown in which I'll be able to join after my first lesson.  AnnJac I was wondering when your very special day is? May will soon be drawing to a close and I'm sure it's this month?! Very exciting!! And great to see you in the rads club.  Hope to have pictures from Sunday dog walk tomorrow....   HFxx",

Violetsniff your photos are always so stylish, I think they\u2019d make lovely cards. Here are my photos from a walk on Thursday, took myself along a new canal path, the first photo is for you, Violetsniff, a cobwebbed door to a secret garden?       Hope to see the chicks another day....Wishing all a lovely weekend xxx",

She was feeding them as I watched. It's not the loveliest of settings, rubbish around including a traffic cone.... but there is nature making the best of it. Can't really make out the chicks at all, but they're there, honest!!   Then next stop, swan family on the path (and on the warpath when anyone went near, I kept a very respectful distance)  Friday tomorrow, hooray, sadly work but still it;s Friday!

I'm hoping you'll be sprinting soon! (not really, I'm no runner myself, walking is all I do!) Nothing big planned today, my walk will be to the other side of town to a friend's house - new venture, I'm going to learn to knit flowers, so you might see me on the Crafts thread if I'm not too hopeless!!

Another on the other side of the river had fallen on his houseboat some years ago, but didn't damamge the boat because of the water cushioning effect - fascinating who you meet by a fallen tree! Anyway we just crossed the river on an earlier bridge and still managed into town for lunch. Different walk back, abouot 7 miles in all so a good walk to blow the cobwebs away.  No more decent walks till Wednesday now as work tomorrow.... HFxx",

Any tips welcome!) Sky was beautiful but a really icy wind! Well done to anyone who has braved the weather today - definitely bracing! HFxx",

Of course you\u2019re feeling alarmed and in a panic, it\u2019s frightening to think you might have something sinister lurking in your breast BUT try to remember, most breast lumps and bumps turn out NOT to be cancer. In my own case I\u2019ve been referred many times: \u2018nodular\u2019 breasts, duct ectasia, fibroadenoma, cysts.... finally drew the dreaded cancer card last year. Horrible, scary, grim etc but doable. Breast cancer is generally very treatable. And I\u2019ve been back and forth from tests with them saying it\u2019s ok, not ok, atypical cells, suspicious lump - mostly to end up with a harmless diagnosis even after a lumpectomy. Just not this recent time! I\u2019m hoping your  stay here is brief and that your lump joins the majority in being benign - and also remember they must be thorough and do all the tests necessary to establish for sure what the blighter is - but if it turns out otherwise then there\u2019s lots of support here from all sorts of lovely people, you will not be alone.  Keep posting, no questions are silly, and let us know how your story unfolds.

In the past I've had investigations for nodular breasts, tearing pains, a fibroadenoma and a cyst (just need the cuddly toy to have a full house - sorry, silly joke referring to an old and rather corny gameshow!) so had dodged the cancer bullet till last October. Your lump could be any of so many possible breast conditions, try not to second guess, keep busy till that appointment comes along and if possible take someone with you for support.  Lovable, sorry you have also had to join this club, sounds like you already know that your lump is malignant so are waiting to confirm diagnosis and discuss treatment plan? Hope the week passes qhickly for you, so horrible waiting.

Have the clinic given you any idea what they think at this stage? On the day I had the biopsies, the doctor told me she thought it was cancer; this was confirmed on a follow up appointment to discuss the results. Have you a date for thiss? Sorry for all the questions!  I hope you get the results very soon, the waiting is so hard. You also say it's not the first biopsy you've had so I wonder was the other/s ok? Again apologies for all the questions but the more info you provide, the more likely you'll find someone here with a similar experience. But we all support each other regardless!

      "Content": "Hi Grandmasgirls, I saw you hadn't had a reply so thought I'd bump it back up - I'm sure someone with a similar diagnosis will soon pop in. Welcome to this online club. None of us would have chosen to join it but hopefully you will find it a great source of support and shared experiences. My type and stage of breast cancer is different to yours so I can't shed much light on your situation, other than to say that you seem to have been waiting a while to have your operation and it doesn't sound like you've had any other treatment in the meantime. It's difficult to speculate as to what else lies in store for you as each person's treatment is tailored to them and their particular type of cancer. I think you should find out more once you've had your lumpectomy (and do ask any questions here about the op - lots of us had them!) and then have your follow up appointment to discuss the post op diagnosis. In the meantime, I don't know if you've already done this, but ther's a group specefically called 'Triple Negative Breast Cancer' (sorry I don't know how to send you a link) - you could post your question there too. And you can also phone the helpline to speak to a Macmillan nurse, sounds like you haven't had much joy at hospital. Wishing you well, do keep posting questions, and keep in touch after your op, gentle hugs, HFxx",

      "Content": "Hi Emmaj91, Glad you have a date now, hope you can try to forget about it as much as is possible, the waiting is tortuous but sadly nothing can speed it up! I thought I'd pop in re not being able to feel the lump - I think breast lumps come in so many variations and permutations, so there's no 'normal' unfortunately. My own breast clinic referrals started at age 21 when a zealous GP referred me because she thought my breasts were 'nodular' (routine breast exam because I was on the pill) - I couldn't feel anything at all - at that referral the consultant just examined them and said no investigations were necessary. Then whilst breastfeeding over 10 years later I was referred because of tearing pains in one breast - again just an exam, diagnosed with duct ectasia. Years after, I found a lump which turned out to be a benign fibroadenoma after lumpectomy. Then had 'lumpiness' investigated - mammogram followed by ultrasound showed them to be cysts. Finally last October, a lump I found myself was diagnosed as cancer and I've finished active treatment, just popping daily pills for 5-10 years. So I guess I'm trying to say, can't really speculate re your lump because there are just so many different breast conditions (and remember the vast majority are NOT cancer) that you just can't generalise.  We will all be hoping that your visit here will be temporary and that you come back on here after your appointment to say all is well. And whatever happens, there is a wealth of support here for all. Keep posting with any questions or just to have a rant and rave, but also hopefully carry on your life in the meantime and try to put it all to the back of your mind until your clinic date. Love and hugs, HFxx  ",

      "Content": "Hi AnnJac, sadly I think your question is of the type, how long is a piece of string..... in that there's no universal length of time for any of these things to heal, and some people get more pain/ discomfort than others. I am now 4 months post op (lumpectomy and node sampling so a lesser assault) and still have some issues. My arm mobility is good, but I have noticed at yoga (only started a week ago) that it is no way equal to good arm, either in overall mobility or in ability to ssustain a position. Pain - upper arm next to armpitand just below to the side - a mixture of numbness and like an inner carpet burn, quite weird. And then there's the nipple (my friends now say oh no not the nipple, it makes them cringe!) - it's been super-sensitive since the op and I think worse since rads. I 'blame' most if not all of this on the node sampling - firstly the injecting of the dye which I watched (a bit) on youtube - ugh!!, and secondly the sampling itself, I believe nerves get stretched/ damaged when they're rootling around to locate and extract them. Again, not everybody seems to be affected, and all to varying degrees. And yes agree re timing - generally better in the morning - I think gravity and general dangling doesn't help. A horizontal rest midday ish with arm elevated or at least supported helped in the early days. BUT, big but, I can also feel that it is all getting better as time goes on. Slow progress for some issues but definitely in the right direction. Good enough now that I can walk briskly swinging bad arm more or less normally, which also seems to help, and good enough that I'm off back to work next week (inner shriek). I have discussed all my issues with GP recently, and all seem to be 'normal' and should resolve in time. I have even managed to wear a bra for most of the day today instead of a crop top, for the first time in 5 weeks! I will feel better supported at work in a decent bra, feels too vulnerable in the crop top. So, very long-winded - sorry! - way of saying, I think these things all do lessen, albeit at times painfully slowly. I hope your issues begin to resolve soon AnnJac,you're having a horrible time re wound healing which I'm sure makes all the other pains and discomforts seem even more unbearable. And I'd say keep asking at the clinic re anything that you think is outside the range of 'normal' effects, don't suffer in silence. Gentle hugs, HFxx",

I haven't had exactly your experieince but have had mammograms which were 'inconclusive' and needed further investigations with ultrasound scans - and which turned out to be cysts. So please try not to jump to the obvious worst case scenario conclusions, easy as it is.  I'm sure someone else will pop in with similar stories. Hopefully you will have the scan and the changes will turn out to be benign, it's hard to tell yourself but remember that most breast lumps, bumps, changes etc turn out to be harmless. Hope your scan appointment is soon, best wishes, fingers crossed, gentle hugs, HFxx",

      "Content": "Hi Emaline, it\u2019s a difficult time (understatement) waiting for surgery, not sure what to expect. As LondonLass has said, it\u2019s hard to predict how you\u2019ll be after the anaesthetic and everyone is different re recovery time. I have had many anaesthetics and am lucky to react well, even feel vaguely euphoric afterwards (I know it\u2019s the drugs!). After some I\u2019ve been back to work 2 days after. My 2 lumpectomies were very different in terms of recovery. The first, for what turned out to be a benign fibroadenoma, was pretty straightforward, and I could have been back at work within a week but it cooincided with half term so I was off for 10 days. The scar was less than an inch. Recent lumpectomy also involved wide local incision (they knew it was cancer) and sentinel node sampling, and the scar is the length of my index finger plus knuckle. A very different beast!! I had expected to be back to work after 2 weeks but was no way ready (my job is very physical) and my GP signed me off for a further month. Then came radiotherapy but that\u2019s another story. So I would say don\u2019t assume anything, be prepared to listen to your body and allow yourself the time you need. Some people are \u2018ready\u2019 and better getting back quickly and of course it also depends on your job. Wishing you well for Monday, good to get the op over and done with and you\u2019ll know the nature of your particular beast! Keep posting and let us know how you get on. Hugs, HFxx",

      "Content": "Hi Scaredgirl34 Sorry you're having a worrying time. Re atypical cells - 13 years ago I had investigations into a pea-type breast lump. As part of the testing process I had a needle aspiration and a core biopsy - one of the results came back as 'atypical cells', I can't remember which. The consultant at that time said the results were 'inconclusive' so I had a lumpectomy; when that was analysed it turned out to be a fibroadenoma. Looking back now, I think they must have known or at least suspected that it wasn't cancerous because there was no suggestion of wide local excision or sentinel node sampling (which I've had recently for a new lump which was identified as IDC from biopsies).  Don't know if that helps. I think I'd phone the hospital for a fuller explanation unless you have an appointment coming up? best wishes and hugs, NNxx",

      "Content": "jiw1953, more pieces of the unique jigsaw that is each cancer case. So yours is similar to mine as mine was also Er+ (means receptive to oestrogen hormone) and HER2 negative (means not receptive to HER2 protein or something like that). I don't remember ever being told the Pr status (I think that's to do with being receptive to progestorone?)  In terms of good or bad, I can only say what the doctor said to me which was that Er+ breast cancers respond to oestrogen blocking drugs - in my case I'm on Anastrozole which is one of the drugs used for post-menopausal women. And I'm doing fine on it - so far so good. She said that the HER2 negativeness meant I wouldn't need Herceptin which I think has to be given with chemotherapy? But someone might correct me. The question of chemotherapy, in my case, depended on whether my lymph nodes were affected - they removed the sentinel nodes when I had my lumpectomy and as these nodes were negative, I didn't need chemotherapy or further nodes tested. But because I only had a lumpectomy (for mine, they regarded a mastectomy as 'over-treatment', maybe because it was relatively small and Grade 2?) I was then offered radiotherapy as 'belt and braces' - to increase my chances of not having a recurrence. I finished 3 weeks radiotherapy last Tuesday - not bad at all, I've luckily not had to work during it all and, although I'm tired and a bit sore, it's really been ok. Sorry to be so long-winded, I'm very wary of saying any type is good or bad so have stuck to my own situation which is all I know for sure! Hope you soon have a date for your surgery, I felt so much better once I had a definite start to my treatment. Keep asking questions - there's also an Ask an Expert section here where you can ask questions to nurses and other professionals. Best wishes and hugs, NNxx",

      "Content": "Hi jiw1953, welcome to the lovely breast cancer group club, what a horrible business to have one cancer dealt with last year and now face a possible different one this year. Nothing fair about cancer. And so very frightening.  But hopefully you can for now keep in mind that it's only a possibility - probably more likely something benign - so try to focus on that. And IF it's a nasty lump, as Lacomtekp says it's nice and small - mine was 3 times that size, whisked out and dispatched in October, nearly halfway through radiotherapy now then will pop some pills for 5 years.  Please keep posting, dump worries and ask questions - and particularly once you have your biopsy there will be lots of people here with similar situations. Love and hugs, NNxx",

      "Content": "jiw1953, more pieces of the unique jigsaw that is each cancer case. So yours is similar to mine as mine was also Er+ (means receptive to oestrogen hormone) and HER2 negative (means not receptive to HER2 protein or something like that). I don't remember ever being told the Pr status (I think that's to do with being receptive to progestorone?)  In terms of good or bad, I can only say what the doctor said to me which was that Er+ breast cancers respond to oestrogen blocking drugs - in my case I'm on Anastrozole which is one of the drugs used for post-menopausal women. And I'm doing fine on it - so far so good. She said that the HER2 negativeness meant I wouldn't need Herceptin which I think has to be given with chemotherapy? But someone might correct me. The question of chemotherapy, in my case, depended on whether my lymph nodes were affected - they removed the sentinel nodes when I had my lumpectomy and as these nodes were negative, I didn't need chemotherapy or further nodes tested. But because I only had a lumpectomy (for mine, they regarded a mastectomy as 'over-treatment', maybe because it was relatively small and Grade 2?) I was then offered radiotherapy as 'belt and braces' - to increase my chances of not having a recurrence. I finished 3 weeks radiotherapy last Tuesday - not bad at all, I've luckily not had to work during it all and, although I'm tired and a bit sore, it's really been ok. Sorry to be so long-winded, I'm very wary of saying any type is good or bad so have stuck to my own situation which is all I know for sure! Hope you soon have a date for your surgery, I felt so much better once I had a definite start to my treatment. Keep asking questions - there's also an Ask an Expert section here where you can ask questions to nurses and other professionals. Best wishes and hugs, NNxx",

      "Content": "Hi maggie50, I saw your post hadn't had a lot of response so thought I'd bump it up as someone out there might have had a similar experience and know more about false negatives. Also, welcome to this online club, none of us would have chosen to come here but get lots of support and encouragement as well as a few laughs along the way! Hope your membership is short and you get reassurance from your results but if not you will hopefully find this site a source of friendship and support. In my own limited expereience I had needle biopsy which showed atypical cells followed by a core  biopsy which was inconclusive. So then a lumpectomy which showed thankfully that the lump was harmless (fibroadenoma). That was 13 years ago; more recently I had 'thickening' investigated with core biopsies and this b***** turned out to be cancer so I have had lumpectomy, sentinel node sampling and currently radiotherapy as well as hormone therapy. It's not lovely but it's absolutely manageable and many here cope with all sorts of poopy treatments but come out smiling the other end. Wouldn't want to speculate re your case but just wanted to check that you still have an appointment to get proper feedback from the biopsy? If not then I would definitely get back on the phone for a fuller explanation. Wishing you well, keep posting here it's a great place to rant and rave if necessary, or just to share and compare with others going through similar expereinces. NNxx",
