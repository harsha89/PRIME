      "Content": "Hi, I was sat on the plane reading your post last night. I was diagnosed on 29/05 with Invasive duct bc and dcis due to this holiday being booked the surgeon said I could go on my hols and they would operate afterwards.  I started on Tamoxifen the 01/06/13. I wore compression stockings on the outward flight 9 hours, these were made to measure by the nurse at my doctors, she told me that they measure the blood pressure in your legs to make sure that you are suitable to wear them and then gave me a prescription which I just collected at the local chemist.  The stockings did help the first week I had no swelling however the 2nd week I got odema in my ankles which I usually do in hot countries and unfortunately I couldn't get the socks on last night so travelled without them and did the usual ankle exercises sat in my seat. I am due to go in for surgery on Mon 19/08 for a wire guided lumpectomy and therapeutic mammoplasty (breast reduction) with Sentinel Node removal.   Hope the above helps and have a lovely holiday.   Bernie x",

      "Content": "Hi,   I have just seen your post re travel insurance.  I was diagnosed on 29/05 with BC, we had already booked and paid for the holiday with travel insurance prior to this.  We paid £90 for insurance for  a family of 3 to travel to the Caribbean. At 49yrs I have been having early mammogram due to a family history of cancer and my BC showed up on this.  My surgeon said that if I started to take Tamoxifen then I could wait till I returned for surgery.  The travel insurance co refused to cover me and would only return £60 as it was pro rata.  I then searched all the sites and rang as many companies as possible to try and get cover.  I had a doctors letter to say I was fit to travel.  Even some of sites advertising that they cover for cancer refused me and some of the quotes were around £1500.  in the end we used moneysupermarket.com and managed to get it for £480.  Not an ideal quote but really didn't have much choice as it comes under America and they refuse to except you without insurance.  It would have cost us £400 to cancel the holiday. I think if we had been travelling to Europe then I would have travelled without insurance and taken the chance but would have taken a credit card so could get a flight back if needed - I don't like to see people being ripped off and that's exactly what's happening. We returned yesterday - didn't use the insurance and surgery is Mon - not looking forward to that bit.  ",
