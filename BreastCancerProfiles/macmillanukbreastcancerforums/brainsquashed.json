      "Content": "Hi Grey Bird, I was diagnosed only last month and like you it was a complete shock. I hadn't felt any lumps and it was only found after a routine mammogram (Thank goodness for them). I waited for the all clear letter to arrive so was shocked when I received a call to say there were abnormalities, I had a couple of biopsies and went along for the results, expecting to go out that evening to celebrate the all clear, that didn't happen. I am having surgery next week to remove the lumps, hopefully that will be the end of it, I also  couldn't bear the thought of a mastectomy, but on Sunday I spent the day with my daughters and realised that I would do anything to stay with them, and see my Grandchildren grow up. Side effects from medication wear off, pain goes away, you are here and by the sounds of it still fighting.  I really hope it all goes well for you, stay strong and stay positive. Take good care",

      "Content": "Hi, I had rad therapy 12 months ago and still get pain in my breast, I have even had acupuncture, which offered some relief.  If I lie on my back then turn on my side, it really hurts, but I have been assured this isn't anything to worry about. That is so much easier said than done, but I have to put my faith in them.  I hope your pain eases soon and that have nothing but positives for the future.  Xx",

      "Content": "I was diagnosed with high grade DCIS last year and had surgery, I then had three weeks of radiotherapy, this finished at the end of October. I was really lucky and didn't experience too much discomfort after. Before Christmas I started to get a permanently erect nipple and the most dreadful irritation under my arm, I have scratched it to the point of making it sore. Has anyone else experienced this. I have used E45 cream.",
