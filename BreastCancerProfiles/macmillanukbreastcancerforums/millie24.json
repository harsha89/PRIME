    "Content": "hi, im so glad to find your post about this subject as i am in a bit of a panic about stuff. i was just about 4 years past diagnosis of breast cancer, er positive. had a lumpectomy, radiotherapy and tamoxifen. i also had Zolodex injections for a year because my periods wouldnt stop. 2 years without periods and i had some heavy bleeding which appears to have just been a period and jothing worse. i had a hysteroscopy which found 2 benign polyps and my endometrium is thickened.  thankfully nothing to worry about at this stage. i saw my oncologist on Thursday who has put me on Arimidex but said i have to have Zoladex injections monthly too. he said this would be a bit of a pain as he wouldhave  to stop my injections for 2 months if he needed to take blood tests. this was the treatment he was to give me. no other choices. i told him i had been thinking about having my ovaries removed because i have just had 3 years of severe flushes and night sweats. these have currwntly stopped and i will have to go through all that again. i felt that if i am to go through all those symptoms again at least it would eventually be over and i could get on with my life without feeling hot, sweaty and dirty all the time. his words were, ' lets do that then'. the trouble is i am now feeling very panicky about my decision. my oncologist agreed to it without any arguement but i dont feel i have enough info to know if i have made the right decision. i am considered low risk of the cancer returning and have not been tested for the brca 2 thing. i know there is an increased risk of heart disease and weak bones ( the bonw risk is the same with the medication) and now i dont know what to do.  it seems rather a drastic procedure when i feel i have made this decision on my own. im not sure if my oncologist is agreeing to it to shut me up. he has not given an opinion at all  i am going to speak to my macmillan nurse on monday but wondered if anyone hahad similar issues. i did not worry about the cancer, just got on with what needed doing but now i feel worried, tearful and very anxious. i look forward to seeing anyone elses thoughts on this",
