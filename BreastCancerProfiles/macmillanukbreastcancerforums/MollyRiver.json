I'm ER and PR positive 8/8 and HER2 negative (this was previously borderline). Waiting for one more test on the HER2 but surgeon believes it will be negative. I had 7 grade 2 invasive tumours (NST, lobular and mucusious - I can't spell it!) and the biggest invasive one was 1.3cm. In between all the invasive tumours we're lots of DCIS. The total area of the tumours was 12.5 cm.  I had a SNB and all 4 taken were clear, and the report says no lymphatic/vascular invasion. It's believed to have been contained in the breast.  I had a mastectomy and when I asked about margins the surgeon said mastectomy margins are always clear. I asked if the tumour was near my chest wall because I had  (still have) pain in the centre of my chest (bone). I was told there was nothing to worry about.  As for my treatment the surgeon said I won't need chemotherapy or radiotherapy - he passed this on from the oncologist. Whom I will not meet because I don't need treatment. I asked would I get chemotherapy to mop up any strays that might have broken off and floated elsewhere. The answer was no. My treatment will be hormone therapy medication. I asked if it came back would it be incurable, he said yes it would be incurable.  As for the oncotype test, my case doesn't meet the criteria for sending it off. I've not been referred for any body scans. I literally feel like I was plopped on a conveyor belt - you have cancer, your boob needs to come off (which is really uncomfortable by the way!), right here's your pills (haven't got them yet though) off you pop and pray it doesn't come back. ",

One lady said having the bilateral was the best thing she ever did.  I think one of them said that they are more likely to accept request for bilateral if it is because you want symmetry not because of fear rushing you to make a rash decision. ",

      "Content": "I'm seriously considering having my right breast off as well as my poorly left breast. No abnormal tissue was detected on the ultrasound and mammogram for the right but in the last few weeks my whole chest is hurting, including my right breast, and both armpits feel heated. I'm wondering if I'm holding myself differently and affecting my chest muscles, hence the soreness.  Has anyone else experienced this?  This isn't the only reason I want the other one off too. I'm fairly ample and my surgeon said that the reconstruction wouldn't match the right breast. By having both symmetrical I'll feel better. Plus I've been looking at some awesome flowery tattoos to cover the scars.  Anyone else requested bilateral mastectomy and glad they did it? Xx ",

      "Content": "Hi Julie, I'm not as far along as you but I can understand your fear. I think many of us do. I've decided (haven't acted on it yet) to write to sheets of questions ready for when I get my results after mastectomy, one will be a list of questions if the results come back as no node involvement or spread and the second is if there is node involvement.  The aim of the questions is to go away from that appointment with every aspect of my fears and concerns answered - whats the plan for keeping me cancer free and hormones at bay. I saw a breast nurse this morning for my pre opt and she said that if there is no node involvement then that is very good, and if there is node involvement it's still okay as they adjust the treatment. She said in both cases people have survived and lived to old age.  A gentleman friend of mine has had cancer 3 times and in each case he has battled and won. My father also had cancer 3 times, first one 21 years ago and now he's 75. Take care and hopefully over time your fears will settle. You have a good result xx ",

Someone said to me, we can't  change what is but we can change how we perceive it.  Maybe looking into the oncotype test and the endopredict test. They might help you to decide which treatments would benefit you?  Hopefully by the end of Monday you'll be more relaxed when you know what the plan is to prevent reoccurrence. Good luck with your appointment.  Xx ",

      "Content": "Hi, You're welcome. I haven't actually got round to writing up my questions yet! I'm starting to feel afraid of my mastectomy (despite great reviews on my surgeon), and like you I'm worrying what if they're wrong about my node involvement.  If you're ER positive you might get hormone treatment that would help prevent it coming back. I saw an article on cancer research uk about a clinical trial on aspirin to prevent cancer returning, its in phase 3 and the trials end 2021. They're studying 3 groups of patients - one group on normal aspirin dose, another on double aspirin dose and the latter on a placebo. Be interesting to know if it works. It's tiring all this worry :)  All the best for your results",

Plus I feel strong and full of energy. I slipped up recently and felt terrible and tired!  Have you heard of the oco protocol? I\u2019ve been looking into that and cbd oil for my dad who is considered incurable. This might help you a little, a male friend was diagnosed with breast cancer last year, when they finally cottoned on that it was BC it had spread into bones and distant organs. He decided to stop chemotherapy etc and was given until Xmas 2017. He\u2019s still here... I\u2019m not sure what he is doing but the tumours are shrinking. They shrank enough that the surgeons agreed to operate to remove the main tumours.  I contacted a lady called Ruth Hiedrich, she had secondary BC over 30 years ago. I found her really supportive and responded quickly to my emails. I wish you the very best  xx ",
