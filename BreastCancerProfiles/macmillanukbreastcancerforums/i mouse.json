      "Content": "Hi Dreamthief Thanks for the reply, have had a look through the forum, nothing recent unfortunately (although I guess fortunately too!) I know they're rare, expexially in someone my age - initially thought to be a Fibroadenoma, but biopsy after surgery was unclear. Another year on, and another surgery - this time confirmed as Phlloydes after biopsy. Then, because things always come in 3s, another surgery (2 weeks ago today)! They have always been borderline, but was told yesterday that, whilst still borderline, they had become more active than ever. So looking at a mastectomy,  at 23 years old, which is terrifying and intriguing at the same time (the only way I can think to explain it!) I won't know more until I get transferred to a hospital nearer me (I was studying at uni when I first found them), and guess until then it won't feel real :S Sorry for the long post, trying to get my head around it all still xx",

      "Content": "Hi all, Been dealing with Phyllodes tumour for the past couple of years, benign but very borderline. 3 surgeries down, with further surgeries to come :S If anyone has any experience of these, and could enlighten me a bit more (internet research is very confusing, and at times contradictory!) it would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance xx",
