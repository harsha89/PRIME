    "Content": "I was diagnosed with Breast Cancer grade 3 last Tuesday. I am at Broomfield hospital and i am not finding the cancer nurses are being very compassionate. I have been told i need my lump removed, chemo and radiotherapy. Has anyone been in a situation where they had thier lump removed and when it was tested they did not need the chemo after all? I have lovely long blonde hair and have aranged to have it cut off before surgery to get used to shorter hair, but wondering if i should wait until the results come back after the lump is removed just in case i don't need chemo or will that never be an option?
