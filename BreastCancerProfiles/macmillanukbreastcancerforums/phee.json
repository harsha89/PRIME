      "Content": "Thanks Tess, it does give me hope to hear that some women are still fertile after chemo. I have told my oncologist that I want the zoladex injection anyway, if that doesn't help at least I know I've done all I can to preserve my ovaries. I'll also speak to her about delaying my chemo if I haven't got any eggs to harvest on Wednesday. I'm just praying that age is on my side and my periods return after chemo xx",

      "Content": "Hi, I'm 32 and was diagnosed with grade 3  invasive ductal carcinoma on 27th August. It's been a tough few weeks but I'm starting to get my head around it all and feel really positive that I will beat this!!! I am now struggling to come to terms with the fact that the chemo might make me infertile. I'm trying to get some eggs frozen but I'm half way through my cycle so may not produce any eggs, I will find out on Wednesday. My oncologist has advised me to start chemo ASAP so I don't have time to wait for my next cycle. I've also asked if I can have a Zoladex injection before chemo to switch off my ovaries, I found out about it from this site but my oncologist said that the evidence that this protects fertility is thin on the ground.   I understand that my health and treatment comes first but I'm feeling very emotional and anxious about the prospect of not having children. It would be great to hear from anyone who has had chemo and if it has affected their fertility. I'm finding it really hard at the mo and everywhere I turn there are pregnant women and babies. It makes me so sad. Thanks Phee xx  ",
