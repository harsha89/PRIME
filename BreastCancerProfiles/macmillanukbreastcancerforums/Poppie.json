      "Content": "Hi Louby123 I've been on Tamoxifen since Nov 16 and fortunately I seem to be escaping well with minimum side effects - I've had hot flushes but mostly at night and completely manageable.  I take mine first thing in the morning.  I was on Genesis and now Wockhart (I did have a slight panic on when the pharmacist gave me a different brand but he assured me that if I had side effects I could switch back). So far so good!  Good luck with it when you do start taking it - for me it hasn't been as daunting as I was expecting and hopefully it will be the same for you.  Very best wishes X",

As has been mentioned, I too find that not all bras fit nicely now so I always try them on and now have a mix of comfy,underwired,mounded and soft bras. All of which I usually ditch late evening :-) There are some lovely bras available which will look and feel fab! Big hugs xx",

      "Content": "Hello :-) I was diagnosed with high grade DCIS in October 2016 it was quite a large area so I was advised to have a mastectomy. Like you I just wanted to make sure I was clear of cancer so I asked for the left side to be removed too - although the surgeon said there was no need and to have only the right side done, which I did.  I am worried about the remaining side although I now feel that I am closely monitored and if anything is a miss I will go straight to the doctors. I try not to let worry consume my days although some times it\u2019s harder than others. I am sure that you will feel more positive after your operation when you know you are clear. I think it\u2019s fair to say most of us worry about aches and pains being the dreaded c however that does improve over time. Good luck with your treatment and merry Christmas xx",

All nodes were clear but they did find 0.6 mm of invasive cancer within the DCIS.  As the tissue was gone (as you thought) my consultant was happy that chemo or radiotherapy was not necessary. I do have Tamoxifen for 5 years as a preventative measure though. We all seem to be treated completely individually but it nice to hear everyone's experiences isn't it - so I hope this helps :- ) Good luck with your results! Love and hugs xx",

I was terrified too and have pretty much blubbed my way through but I got through it and you will too. If I was giving myself advice I would say don't eat too much after the anesthetic (I was sick - hope thats not too much info lol) and don't be afraid to ask for help and support if you need it.
