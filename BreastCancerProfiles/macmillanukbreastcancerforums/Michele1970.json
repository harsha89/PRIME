      "Content": "Hi Yvonne, I had my 3rd FEC yesterday and today I am feeling pretty damn good!  First FEC wasn't great, 2nd FEC was hideous and I was very sick and felt completely crap but so far this one has been much better.  That's the strange thing I have found with FEC it never seems to affect you the same each time, which is a bit unsettling as you never quite know what to expect. Not sure what to advise you really, as one of the other ladies has said you could try and postpone it if you really want to do the interview (which sounds great by the way!).  I dread them postponing any of mine as my last one is due on 14th December and I so want mine to be finished by Christmas - not least because I have a 4 and 9 year old!  Good luck with whatever you decide, if only we could predict what the dreaded FEC would do to us it would be much easier wouldn't it? All the best to you, it sounds a fab opportunity.   Michele xx",

      "Content": "Hi Sammy, Just wanted to send you a big hug.  I am an identical twin and currently fighting grade 3 breast cancer which my beautiful sister is supporting me with.  A while ago she suffered a brain hemorrhage and the thought of losing her was just too awful to contemplate, thankfully she survived and I was very pleased to be by her side with her recovery, she in turn is now here for me too. I know how tough it is to watch your sister suffer so much and for me seeing her suffer was far worse than going through what I am right now, as other people have said I think it is far worse for the families than it is for the cancer suffers.  As also mentioned, the treatments for cancer are improving all the time and she is being treated in a really great place. My advice to you is to be there for her as much as possible, do all the things you want to do together as much as her health allows and tell her how much you love her.  Make every day count.  My heart and warm wishes go out to you both, stay strong for each other and the very best of luck to your sister on her journey. Take care Sammy.   Michele xx",

      "Content": "Hello Sheila, Welcome to the club nobody wants to join! I am sorry you have found yourself here but there are lots of lovely ladies to help you on your journey. I was diagnosed with the same as you in July (Grade 3 Invasive Ductal Cancer) and had a wide local excision on 13th July.  I have so far had 3 x FEC and will be having my 4th on Friday.  My symptoms have varied on each one but non of them have been unbearable or made me take to my bed!  I have 2 children aged 4 and 9 years and I have still been able to take them and fetch them from school each day and go about my general business.  The first few days after chemo I feel a bit dizzy but nothing too bad. I am absolutely terrified of needles so opted to have a PICC line fitted which was done 2 days before my chemo started and I am so glad I did.  All my chemo goes through it and they take my blood out of it.  There isn't anybody trained to flush a PICC line at my surgery and initially I was doing a 66 mile round trip every Friday to get it flushed but the hospital have now trained my sister to do it and she does it for me every week - much easier!  I would definitely recommend the PICC line as I haven't had any problems with it and I don't really know its there any more. Everybody's journey is individual but we are all here to help and support each other.  I have had tremendous support off the lovely ladies on here and I am sure you will too.  Good luck with your journey, I hope it becomes less frightening as you go along. Take care.   Michele xx",

A couple of questions about the PICC line - did you have a waterproof cover for it and if so where did you get it from and also did it hurt when they took it out?  I had mine flushed today but have to do a 60 mile round trip for them to do it which is a complete waste of time and money!  They have agreed to train my sister to do it next week, can't wait.

I will ask my oncologist this when I see him on 25th October but just wondered if anybody here knew the answer in the meantime.  i had a pain in my back yesterday and was convinced it had spread to my lungs!

I think once its gone I will feel better about it.  At least it will grow back, could be worse my teeth could fall out then I really would be scuppered!!!

The way I am dealing with it is by telling myself (and my daughters) that it's only a temporary thing and that it will grow back.  At least its not my teeth that have fallen out because they wouldn't grow back!! Good luck with whatever you decide.  I have found that I am addicted to buying scarves now!!! Take care   Michele xx",
