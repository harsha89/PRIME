      "Content": "  Hi Sally I had a lumpectomy in Dec (week before Christmas) and then a further lump removed in Feb and then as there were no clear margins, I am now recovering from a mastectomy and immediate reconstruction. I was told originally I wouldn't need Chemo, just radiotherapy but now I have had a mastectomy I am hopeful I won't need either; get my results next week. Depending on the grade of cancer and margins, you may not need Chemo so don't worry unnecessarily. I was in hospital with 3 other ladies from the same town and screening session and although we all had the same op, we all had different results so no-one can tell you exactly what will happen.. I find the best way to deal with this is to speak about it openly and your friends will help you through it. Don't bottle things up. It is easier for your friends to help you if you are open and then they don't feel awkward. Remember a trouble shared is a trouble halved.    Pauline x    ",

      "Content": "Hi After being diagnosed with Breast cancer last Nov and having 2 lumpectomies following by a mastectomy and immediate reconstruction, my son and his wife gave me a voucher for a pamper day at a health club. Tried to book it today but they said I would not be allowed any massages because of the cancer, something to do with dormant cells. They said I could have a manicure and pedicure instead LOL but I can't bare anyone touching my feet and I was really looking forward to it; especially the head massage. I have now sent an e-mail to my breast care nurse to clarify this but wondered if anyone else had come across this as I have never seen anything mentioned before. And does this include facials which is my only treat? Regards Pauline",

I started this thread and I am still waiting for Bannatynes to come back to me. I appreciate they may be just too cautious but I rather they are like that than just let anyone use their facilites with no questions asked.  Perhaps they just need educating on this matter and hopefully we are the ones that can do this. Keep watching as I will post when I get an answer back from them; they are supposed to be phoning be back this afternoon as I have been chasing them Take care Pauline xx",

      "Content": "For an update on this thread, I have received the following e-mail from my Breast Care Nurse:....................... We would advise avoiding the operated area but would not advise against having massage elsewhere. I\u2019m not sure what they are talking about in terms of \u201cdormant cells\u201d. The Cancer Research UK website has information on massage and they say there is no evidence for this theory. It might be worth printing this off for them. If you wish, tell them that your cancer was lymph node negative and we would not counsel against massage. Certainly facial/ head massage would not be any issue at all. I think they are being extremely over cautious. My colleague in the Maggie\u2019s Centre is doing some more research on your behalf and I will pass on anything she finds. I\u2019m not sure of their rationale as massage is frequently available at Cancer Help Centres and in hospices as part of regular complementary therapies. If you let them know that the hospital does not advise against massage for someone in your situation, with the proviso of avoiding recently operated areas, then I don\u2019t see why they shouldn\u2019t provide the service.   .... I am now going to e-mail Bannatynes with the above e-mail to see what they now say rather than just speak to the receptionist. Watch this space!!   Pauline",

I did say I think that perhaps they should ask more relevent questions and then do a referral to someone in the Spa.

Thankfully the neighbours helped dig us out on Sunday and got the car out but couldn't get it back so had a bit of a trek Monday morning in the snow to find the car. However, all done and dusted and back home. Was as blue as a smurf with the dye but probably because I am so small. Not needed any painkillers since the 2 I had afterwards and I had a shower and washed my hair today so feeling close to normal. Feel a bit anxious about taking off the dressing as my breast looks really small so I might not like what I see. Thank you for your support. Mr Greenall came and saw me twice afterwards and Oliver (the anth******)All the nurses were lovely and like you said, had a good chat with others ladies there. I will have my results on Jan 5th. Now my computer has broken down so borrowing my son's and the gas heating has pasked up so waiting for engineer. It never rains unless it pours. Merry Christmas and thanks again for your support.

I have very fine hair that's gets lank and greasy very quickly; it has to be washed every morning otherwise I look a right sight. Sarah advised me to have pj's that open up down the front; any other advice on what to take in would be welcomed.

I been been allocated a nurse called Sarah and she seemed very nice but I guess until I have had my op, I don't know whats ahead for me.

I try to think of it as an interuption rather than an illness.  I had a lumpectomy the Monday before Christmas which really annoyed me as I had to miss the works Christmas Party. Arranged to go back to work 3 weeks later and advised there was no clear margins so had to have another lumpectomy. Went back to work finally and then told still no clear margins so would have to have mastectomy. I knew straight away I wanted a reconstruction although my surgeon said some changed their mind because of all what they go through. Any way had the mastectomy and reconstruction but waiting now for an appointment with the oncologist as I may need Chemo as tumour was 40mm and I only have small breasts. I am surprised you say your lump was only 4.5 cm and not 5cm as there is not much difference. Positive thinking and good friends around is the way to go. I talk openly at work about it so no-one feels awkward mentioning it and even joke about it.   I feel that I am one of the lucky ones as it was found before it got too bad; some aren't as lucky.   Love Pauline xx",
