    "Content": "I started taking Femara pre surgery and was given 2 months supply, on a hospital follow up post surgery I was given a further 2 months. I didn't really experience any SE of note during that time.  When I visited the GP for a repeat prescription I was given a generic letrazole manufactured by Teva. After some time I started to feel horrendous. I felt tired and emotionally wobbly but worst of all was the joint pain. On a bad day I could hardly walk and stairs were extremely difficult. A few months down the line and following some research I spoke with the GP regarding going back on Famara. I was told Famara couldn't be prescribed due to cost issues. I asked about a private prescription but was told that wasn't possible.  I've now tried several different brands and found Sun Pharma causes the least problems but I'm suffering with my knees. I've been told I have osteoarthritis of both knees but I do wonder if part of the issue is letrazole!  I have a hospital visit coming up and I'm contemplating asking about taking a break from medication to see what happens.",
