      "Content": "Hi Everyone, I have just started my 2nd course of chemo, almost 11 months on from a Taxol therapy schedule where I received the chemo on a weekly basis from Sept 15 to Jan 16. I have TNBC, grade 3, stage 4. I have primary tumour in breast and mets in lungs, liver, ribs and spine. The list and lungs are playing up at the moment and have just started capecitabine 2000mg twice a day. As yet no particular side effects noticed, but this may change as therapy progresses.  When I had my Hickman Line in for the Taxol Therapy, I found that my allergy to plasters extended to virtually every dressing on the market and ended up with significant skin problems that required the input of the tissue viability team. In the end we had to revert to good old fashioned sterile gauze and a tape called hypafix which seemed to have the least impact on my skin.  However the dressings that were the best were the border dressings and in particular the Mepilex border dressing and Mepilet border dressings. They are significantly more expensive, but much less abrasive than Mepore and Tegaderm etc.  When I became nauseous, and this was quite often, I found munching on a ginger biscuit or nibbling a bit of stem ginger really settled my stomach, so did not end up taking any of the domperidone that was prescribed for me. (My friends still think I was prescribed prn champagne!).  I ended up with a radiation burn on my back five or six weeks after a five day course of radiotherapy for the tumour at L2 spine to shrink it and stop some of the symptoms of metastatic spinal cord compression, and now the wound has healed am prescribed a cream called Medihoney Cream, this was suggested by the tissue viability team and seems to be relatively new on the market. It doesn't smell as good as it sounds it might, but has prevented the scar from drying out, cracking and peeling.  I would really appreciate any tips or advice from anybody who has taken capecitabine, any things to avoid, and any things that might help as the treatment progresses.  I am quite proactive in my treatment plan, and not one to mope and feel sorry for myself, I am just 50 years old, and been retired on the grounds of ill health after 30 years in the NHS. The most difficulty I currently face is what if any benefits I can claim, I am already in receipt of PIP since last September, but never having claimed before don't even know if I am entitled to anything because I get an occupational pension and had a lump sum. Again any advice would be appreciated as I try to negotiate the quagmire of the benefits system.  This is my first post and I wish everyone well in their treatment and beyond.  Many Thanks Sue",

      "Content": "Hi Lynnwadd, I had chemotherapy on a weekly basis from beginning September 2015, until 26th January 2016. I found that when I was nauseous eating a piece of stem ginger or a ginger nut biscuit settled my stomach, I can't remember who had suggested it and I thought at the time anything is worth a try.  For the dry mouth my hospice at home nurse had suggested I ask my GP to prescribe something called Biotene. It is a gel that acts like replacement saliva and is really useful when feeling water logged from the regime of making sure you take enough fluids. I also found an app for my phone called My Water. It calculates how much fluid you need to aim for during the day and sets an alarm for your drinks.  I used it for the five months that I was on chemo.  My last ultrasound and CT were very positive the primary breast tumour has shrunk from 15cm to 3.4 cm and the metasteses in my lungs are now barely visible. The mets in my spine and ribs have not grown any larger, they are still a little concerned about a tumour in my liver, but are monitoring that via monthly blood tests. I feel very well in myself despite the fact that the cancer I have is incurable- it is manageable. Take all the support that is offered and above all be kind to yourself, the juicing is fantastic and I froze some of mine to make healthy lollipops and slushies.  I wish you all the best for your treatment and future. ",
