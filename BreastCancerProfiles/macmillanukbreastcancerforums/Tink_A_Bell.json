    "Content": "HI, Just to say a big hello! I've just joined... I've finished my treatment after being diagnosed last Aug :D and am here to find ways of living a happy life after cancer without constant worry, ways to deal with stress, ways to not let my mind wander and sleep well.... Be great to get to know you all and perhaps find a little ease in talking to people who are or have been in a similar boat...can be a lonely time can't it.  Hope you are all enjoying a nice bank holiday today Much love, Tink  ",
