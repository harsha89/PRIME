      "Content": "Hello! After a mastectomy in January I had my first chemo session last Wednesday. My haemoglobin was only 10.5 before the session, and I went in for another blood count today, recognising those icy fingers of anaemia! It had dropped to 9.7 - not too bad, but enough to prompt a 2 unit transfusion, which is happening on Monday. I'm really looking forward to feeling perkier thanks to someone else's good health, but I have never had a blood transfusion before that I've been conscious for. How long will it take? Will it feel odd? All questions I should have asked before I left the chemo unit, I know.  The thing that makes me shiver, and this is really, really irrational, is that epirubicin chemical is bright red, and I associate it with burning, hair loss, black veins...when I think of any red liquid going into me, my brain defaults to the epirubicin and I actually shiver. Absolutely insane. x",

      "Content": "Hi - has anyone had a delayed reconstruction? How do they look? Are you happy with the result? I've seen and been impressed by breasts immediately reconstructed with expanders, and would love these in a couple of years' time. But I couldn't face recon right now. I've had one mastectomy (left) which was left flat because they thought I might need radiotherapy - which I now don't. I am going to have a right prophylactic mastectomy also, but might have to wait until after chemo. Both surgeons I've met are encouraging me to have the right recon at the same time as the mastectomy because of \"better cosmetic results\". In the same surgery, they would do a \"delayed\" recon on the left breast.  But this one left mastectomy alone has been troublesome, with an infection and necrosis - the thought of that happening over an expander makes me shiver. So I'm tempted to \"go flat\" for a couple of years, and then either stay flat (I've had massive breasts all my life, and this quite appeals) or have delayed recon. But what if delayed reconstructions really aren't as cosmetically successful as immediate ones, which is what my surgeons are telling me? Are they just trying to save money by doing it all in one surgery?! What do reconstructed ladies think?",

      "Content": "Hello! I was diagnosed on 7th December last year and it took a magnificent 51 days until surgery - the worst time of my life, and, for me, much, much more emotionally draining than the mastectomy and chemotherapy (I'm half way through the chemo as of today - hooray!) that followed. So in my experience you're in the worst place right now. I ended up on diazepam (valium) to cope with the delays, the waiting for scans, the waiting for results...and it was brilliant. A 7mg dose (upped from 6mg) made it impossible to latch onto the negative thoughts (or any thoughts at all, for that matter!) but an 8mg dose would make me fall asleep - we needed to play around a bit until I found the right dosage, and my GP was brilliant.  As soon as I neared the date for the mastectomy, I didn't feel like I needed the diazepam any more. Although I had to then wait 2 weeks for the pathology results on the \"specimen\" and the lymph nodes, so I think I took a couple (handful?!) of pills in that fortnight. Don't suffer the emotional turmoil without seeking help. For me, this was diazepam, but I know ladies on the site who have found antidepressants brilliant. My fears were not about losing my breast, but about not living, so I might have found the post-mastectomy weeks much easier than you will, but this site is brilliant and you will find much help and support here. Good luck, and I am thinking of you. x",

The nurses all tell us not to read blogs because people tend to write about things that worry us, and so the worry spreads, but I have just returned from my first FEC (75) session, and it could not have gone better. I'm sure time will mock me and the fatigue will kick in, but the process itself was smooth and not nearly as painful as I was expecting. The anti sickness medication worked a treat - I did not feel a moment of nausea, and I have a sackload of anti sickness medication to prevent it from starting - even a suppository, should it come to that! (And a glove with which to administer said suppository!) For me, the Epirubicin was the worse - this is the red chemical which makes our hair fall out (boo) and it burnt a little bit going in. Ask for a \"warm pack\" for your arm - it soothed my discomfort almost immediately. It's apparently caused by your veins trying desperately to constrict and stop the chemical. The one that was supposed to hurt a bit - the cyclophosphomide (sp?) didn't hurt at all - I just got a not unpleasant pre-sneeze tingling in my nose. I also got a ham sandwich, fresh coffee, yoghurt and biscuits delivered to me.  So here we go - a positive FEC experience!

      "Content": "Hi -  I was diagnosed at 40 with lobular cancer and for me it was the need to survive that was so strong I would have taken both boobs off with a spoon if I'd had the courage to do it. My right breast was clear, and I had to get a second opinion because my hospital's policy is not to operate on healthy tissue. I'm \"in between\" at the moment; I've had the left mastectomy, but not the right, although that will come. I want them both off. I want symmetry, and I never want to go through this worry again (although every headache, abdominal pain, back pain in the future will also bring the fear of its return.)  It's interesting, though - I found out today that my tumour specimen (post-surgery) was only 25mm. They had told me that the MRI scan suggested 53mm - quite a difference, and one of the reasons I was so desperate for a mastectomy so quickly. But even if I'd known pre-surgery that it was \"only\" 25mm, I think I'd still have opted for the mastectomy. I was absolutely convinced that it was what I wanted - as long as I could get the right one off, too. I feel for you and your dilemma - it must be hard to be caught in an undecided state. As everyone has said, you do what feels right. I've seen double mastectomy breasts reconstructed with expanders and they looked amazing - symmetrical and youthful and brilliant. Lumpectomy patients can also be reconstructed. I have two young children (3 and 7), and the need to be around for them helped me make up my mind - if I could have my liver, bones and brain removed too (the places breast cancer likes to travel too), then I'd do it! But having said that, I am now having to hide away from my kids, not letting them see the mastectomy result because it will frighten them. Positives and negatives... Perhaps tomorrow morning, you will wake up with the answer. I wish you luck in finding your conviction. At the moment I'm sitting on the fence about whether to reconstruct or \"go flat\", and on the fence is a horrid place to be! Perhaps a few glasses of wine might help you make up your mind? Good luck - xx",

      "Content": "Hi Pat - this was me about a month ago. It is utterly, utterly dreadful. Mine ended up being an invasive lobular cancer (which has a branching habit) and, although it is rarer than ductal, the survival rates are still about the same, and pretty darned good (I think i read around 85% for 5 yrs on Cancer Research). But you wan to know what you've got and what they are going to do about it, and it was the biopsy result which was the worst wait for me. And when it came through, the surgeon had missed the 53mm tumour (how?! HOW?!) and so I had another wait for another biopsy, and then another wait for the results... Anyway, the reason I'm rambling is that during this time I went to my GP and said that I definitely wasn't depressed but needed \"something to stop me thinking\", and she have me a (short) supply od diazepam (Valium). When I feel a wave of panic coming on (like when I found out I'd have to wait 2 weeks for an MRI scan) I take it and in 10 minutes suddenly it's hard to latch onto those dreadful thoughts and (this is the best bit) time starts to pass more quickly. You do build up tolerance to it, though, so you need to be careful - your GP probably won't prescribe more than a month's supply, and almost certainly not if you have a history of substance abuse. The crying does eventually stop - but I know that's no help to you now. I still haven't had even so much as a tablet, let alone surgery or chemo, and I was diagnosed on 7th Dec. My view is becoming more nihilistic each day. Go and see your GP. Much love, and I'll think of you tonight before I go to sleep (I don't pray, but I think!) xx",

First, the \"It's 53 mm and so you'll have a mastectomy\" has turned into \"It was 25mm\" (but no mention of how I could, therefore, have had breast-conserving surgery - not that I would have wanted it.) Half the size! To be fair, they did always caution me about the unreliability of scans with lobular cancer. And I would have wanted a mastectomy regardless. On both sides, for symmetry's sake. Which I will be getting - but only after fighting for it (at the moment I have one 34FF breast dangling and lonely). The tumour was a fairly fast-growing one, but they got it all out (hooray!), there is no sign of vascular spread, (hooray!) and the two lymph nodes they took are also clear (hooray!). I have read academic articles that suggest that between 5% and 8.8% of negative lymph node results are false negatives, so I, of course, mentioned this, and yes, the surgeon said that this was why they would check me regularly. Unless \"regularly\" is every half hour, that will never be good enough, but I accept that \"regularly\" will mean every 6 months. The tumour was HER2 negative, so no battle needed to get Herceptin as it wouldn't work. But it is oestrogen positive, so I'll probably be on hormone drugs for 5 years - I can only imagine how impossible I am going to be to live and work with once they take hold. The one fight I am going to have is to get the tumour BRCA1 and BRCA2 tested - these are the gene mutations that make a breast cancer inheritable. My tumour hasn't automatically been tested because the NHS are cheap money-pinching scoundrels. Their official excuse is that I have no family history - hence they don't bother testing. My argument is that I have 2 daughters who now do have family history - and who I want to be able to make informed decisions in later life if I did have the inheritable strain. If anyone knows how I could play the system - or pay the system - to get this done, I'd be interested.  I am having a mysterious sternum lump ultrasounded on Friday. In a startling display of rudeness, my surgeon suggested that the lump could be fatty tissue. So I shall hope for that. In a way. In Scotland (thank you to Flower, for this info) a lady diagnosed with breast cancer automatically gets a bone, abdomen and liver scan, and a chest X-ray, regardless of whether the lymph nodes are affected or not. We are looking into how much those scans cost privately. I might have to sell a kidney. Why, oh why, don't we get the same treatment in England.  Before giving me key results, 140ml of seroma was syringed out of the wound, which didn't hurt one bit, and the necrosis I have will be debrided next week. We will know by them if it will heal itself or need excising. Either side of the necrosis, the scar is unbelievably tidy - I would never have imagined that it would be possible to be almost invisible at this stage already (today is day 13 post-op). The cancer surgeon and the cosmetic surgeon are wanting me to have \"this\" reconstruction, and \"that\" reconstruction, but I don't know. I don't trust the cosmetic surgeon. He wants to turn me into a 20 year old. I'd look ridiculous. I'm not letting him anywhere near me. (I'm 40) Anyway, the reconstruction will all have to wait anyway if the oncologist decides tomorrow that I will have chemotherapy. It is \"unlikely\" because the nodes were unaffected, but \"likely\" because of my age. It's always good to have clear answers from the NHS. Anyway, there is a possibility that I won't have it! Apparently, the oncologist feeds all my details into a computer, and it then estimates how better my prognosis would be if I had chemotherapy, based on all the people who have gone before me - sort of like a medical indicator grade. If chemotherapy will offer me around 5% of a better prognosis, then I'll have it, I am told. I don't really know what to think. On the one hand I really, really want it, because of that 8.8% \"false negative\" lymph node result thing, and the fact I don't live in Scotland. And I've already bought hats. And shaved my hair on one side. On the other hand, If I don't have it, the other mastectomy could happen sooner and life could be back to normal in a couple of months.  A long piece; sorry. But I was terrified this morning that I would go in and be told \"stage 4\", and the reality is sometimes so much kinder to us than the fear we allow in. I thought that those of you waiting for your Mx might like to read about one lady's experience when it came to \"specimen\" results. Hope you don't think I'm self-absorbed thinking this. xx  ",

You lie on your front with your breasts dangling in 2 holes. They had to widen the aperture to accommodate mine... embarrassing... And remember that scans are sometimes crazily inaccurate. My MRI said 53mm - when the tumour was out it measured a much happier 25mm. Try and think of the scan as a spa treatment! xx",

      "Content": "I went to my routine oncology appointment yesterday (the one before my third FEC, which is next Wednesday). I nearly ended up being admitted, but my oncologist has decided to treat me for a DVT as the bank holiday was nearly upon us and he didn't want me languishing in hospital for 4 days waiting for the diagnostic tests and the treatment that he could send me away with anyway. He was fairly certain that this is what I have. So I have 14 days' worth of anticoagulant injections, and there is no time (thanks to the bank holiday) to put a Hickman line in before my next FEC so they are just going to try my arm veins again. Shiver. I am a bit nervous. My fears have shifted from dying before 5 years are up to dying tonight! I'm really annoyed with myself for not taking my symptoms seriously. My arm has been slightly swollen for days, very tender (I've had to change my watch wrist), and I had a bizarre bout of breathlessness over breakfast one morning that I put down to anaemia. I didn't even notice when I miraculously recuperated from this breathlessness and went shopping!  Anyway, my oncologist said that chemotherapy can produce clots in 15% of patients (my memory is not to be trusted right now, though), so please all look after yourselves! I think mine is just a little one floating merrily around - I feel a bit sorry for it. It's so difficult to know what is just sore veins and what is something more serious. I was told that after 2 FEC sessions my arm should not have been hurting like it was, the swelling was not right, and my platelet count was strangely healthy - all of which suggested a blood clot. The side effects just keep on coming, don't they?! x",

      "Content": "This was similar to my experience - noone actually said the words, \"you have cancer\" at the first clinic appointment. I had the fine needle biopsy that was \"strongly suggestive\", then a core biopsy that failed and had to be redone - long story short, I have 53mm spread of lobular invasive carcinoma. You are in what I found to be the worst place - waiting to know what exactly you have and what your treatment will be. I found the nurses frustrating - they played everything down and held my hand, when what I wanted was information. If your cancer isn't lobular you might not need an MRI and could get surgery really quickly. I had to wait 2 weeks for an MRI - I went to Brighton and took diazepam to make the time go faster. I was diagnosed on 7th dec - still waiting for treatment but yours might come much quicker. I know how you're feeling and the diazepam really helped me - just don't abuse it because you can build up tolerance. Hopefully your surgeon will give you a date before August (joke - I've just lost my faith in the NHS pace!) thinking of you xxx I know that between diagnosis and treatment is probably one of the worst times x",

It's the invasive but that makes things more complicated - but even then our survival is much, much more likely than not. You need to do some research - it will comfort you. Or get a friend to do it for you - look at the cancer research website. I have a 3 and 7 year old and, like you, the tears come when I think of them, but try not to react emotionally until you know facts. For my type of cancer, for example, I know that the 5 yr survival rate is 85% - not bad odds at all! I'm only 40, am Pre-menopausal and have a cancer that makes up only 10% of breast cancers so I've been unlucky so far - I fully plan to be one of the 85% survivors! Arm yourself with facts - loads of women die from breast cancer but ONLY because loads of women get it! Read statistics carefully and if they confuse you see your GP so she can explain them. In fact, make an appointment first thing Monday! X",

I am reading about how ladies are having chemo prior to surgery, tamoxifen, quick surgery...but I was diagnosed on 7th Dec, and still no surgery planned until 26th Jan! I wouldn't mind so much, but over 5cm in a breast seems massive to me.  It's a lobular type and a nurse took 7 days to put in a request for the MRI scan than revealed the size, even though the surgeon marked the card \"urgent\". 7 days! \"We were very busy,\" she said when my husband complained. You have to have the MRI done in the first 2 weeks of your menstrual cycle, and because of that nurse's pootling I missed that window and had to wait another 2 weeks for the MRI - then a week for results, etc. I am so angry with the nurse concerned. Such a big tumour, yet 51 days to wait from diagnosis to treatment! The guidelines are very clever - if they put off devising a treatment they then have 31 days to start performing it. So I have no grounds for complaint. So, so angry and upset. :( :( :(      ",

      "Content": "Hi. I was diagnosed on 7th December and still have no treatment and no surgery date. The latest is that I am waiting for an MRI appointment - only \"one radiologist for the whole hospital\". I have been told that it will be 2 weeks before I'm scanned despite my surgeon marking me \"urgent\" and emailing the radiologist directly. So I was diagnosed with cancer on 7th Dec, and told it was invasive lobular grade 2 on 23rd Dec. It's now 29th Dec, and an MRI scan should be around Jan 10th. So treatment won't start until days after that - I'll have waited at least  5 weeks from the cancer diagnosis - but I think the guidelines are 3 weeks from knowing it's invasive? My hospital is either going to miss that guideline or push it right up to the day if I get lucky with MRI scan dates. But they are saying that it might even be a 3 week wait until my MRI - because they like doing in in the second week of the menstrual cycle. If only they had asked for the MRI scan last week (when they had the results) then I would be done and dusted. I am an NHS patient - is this the experience of other NHS patients? ",
