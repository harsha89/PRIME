    "Content": "Hi I've had a lump for a while but tho it was just where the bone in my bra was rubbing as it was underneath my breast. I felt it the other day and it's bigger and hard, I went to doctors who referred me to a breast clinic but it's two weeks away and I just have a gut feeling that it is cancer, I made the mistake of googling it as I also have back ache and pains in my hip , am I being silly or is my gut feeling correctÂ ",
