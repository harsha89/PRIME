      "Content": "Hi Joan hope your doing well!! I had my op to remove 2 lumps from my right breast on the 5th July .... I had no problems till around 3 weeks after when i went to see the specialist for my histology results when it felt likei  had another lump unlike you i kept quiet scared of what  they might say .. but its it normal as i was told on the ward and also by the specialist who checked me out the same day as my results it was just a collection of fluid due to the lymph nodes not being there to distribute it around my body .. they told me they may be a need to go to the breast care ward and have this drained but i have been lucky and it has resolved itself and hasnt needed to be drained. Cant you go back to the ward where you had your surgery and ask for their opinion?? someone i met on the ward i had my surgery went back last week for her scar checking out as it looked infected so i am sure they would be more than happy to see you. Did you have a full sweep of your nodes?? If i was you and was worried i would go definately go back to the ward where i had surgery they will put ur mind at ease. Gill",
