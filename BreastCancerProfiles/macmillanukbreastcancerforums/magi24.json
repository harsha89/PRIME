    "Content": "Hello, I have been diagnosed 2 weeks ago with sarcoma breast cancer. At the beginning the cancer was 4,5 cm and now is 7cm and Im still waiting for the operation. Before I didn't feel any pain at all. But from yesterday I feel such a big pain in my chest and back like someone is stabbing me. I went to hospital on emergency but the doctors said everything is fine. Can someone tell me how long is the waiting time fr the operation as the doctors told me I have to wait but its been 2 whole weeks already. And is that normal Im starting to feel really unwell plus a huge headache everyday.  Did anyone had the same problems?  Magda",
