      "Content": "Hi Rosielee Chemotherapy was what I dreaded the most, and although in shock when told got BC and felt rubbish after lumpectomy and lymph node removal - when I was told I had cancer in two of the lymph nodes and needed chemo, I melted down. Four weeks waiting for chemo didn't help, but i did sort of get my head around it. managed to speak to a couple of people who have recently been through  -found that really helped. Had my 2nd chemo last Friday, so Day 3 today. Not a walk in the park and we all react differently, but if you accept you won't be doing alot for the first week, recovering for the second week and then have a week feeling yourself again - I was told that by a colleague and mine pretty much followed that pattern. Honestly it's better when you're on the road - at least you're knocking them down  -I am now a third of the way through 3xFEC and 3x Tax. Next one will be halfway! We all have down times - have a good cry, let it out, and then do whatever you need to get through. Good luck and hugs Clare xx",

I was not sleeping, trying to finish things off at work as well as dealing with the enormity of diagnosis. I felt like i was barely able to function, it was awful. It is definitely the worst time of my 3 month experience so far. Being on the chemo road is not nice, but mentally it is a smooth ride in my opinion! Hope today goes well Clare x  ",

      "Content": "Well I went for my 3rd and final FEC on Friday afternoon. Had felt a bit extra tired the previous evening and Friday morning, and had to wait for ages to go in and felt fairly rough but still up for it. Cold cap went on, and felt a bit sick and dizzy as I do when it first goes on but usually passes after a minute or two. This feeling did not pass, and when the nurse came back 20 mins later I was nearly passing out. BP and all other obs were ok, but felt awful. So didn't have chemo, said they would re-book for Monday, but can't do it til Friday 20th. Really hacked off. Disappointed in myself and frustrated at not getting it done. Stupid as no obvious illness. Still feel extra tired and headache-y. Dr said it may be due to an accumulation of the drug and a late reaction - after only 2 chemo sessions - great! Just to make me feel even more inadequate, there was a lovely 75yr old lady next to me on her last session, who had barely felt the effects! And there's me at 49 throwing a wobbler and failing to even have my 3rd FEC! Worried now that if I don't feel better on Friday, the cold cap might be too much to bear and I have to go without it. Although my hair is now so-oooo thin, I don't know if it worth bothering.... Miserable weekend, its changed all my summer plans by a week, won't even be able to take my to son to his orthodontist appt next week. Sorry to rant, first time I've started a thread. Roll on Friday and get FEC done and dusted. Clare  ",

Not looking forward to this as I have worked closely with quite a few of the therapeutic radiographers, male and female!! Planning to ask about covering up, what arrangements are made and make sure some are in place for all patients, not just special treatment for me!! To all - DO NOT PUT UP WITH THIS. You have an absolute right for privacy and dignity. If there is no arrangement for minimal exposure of the breast - ask why not. My breast care clinic has small capes with velcro front fastening, similar to trisha, sounds like all should have this and things won't change unless we KICK UP A FUSS - for ourselves and future patients. Also am having photos done for a trial, and know the medical photographer very well - think he may be more embarrasssed than me!! Don't mind the tattoo, although hate them. Not as bad as a scar!

The pains started Sunday evening and I had 3 rough days (including an overnight in hosp Tues due to temp up, but only 24hrs) but started feeling better Wed pm and managed to be off the painkillers from yesterday. Pat is so-oooooooo right about the emotional side - I got upset and frustrated a few times on FEC, but have been an emotional wreck at times with this. Be prepared - warn other halves!! I sucked ice cubes during my Tax chemos and have had no mouth ulcers/sores/thrush. It is horribly cotton woolly and everything tastes foul, although this did ease in the last week of the cycle. Haven't found anything that tastes nice. No hot flushes for me on Tax - loads on FEC. Very very fatigued. Thought FEC had me tired. Had to lie down after my (short) shower this morning - even my heart was going like the clappers like I'd done 100m! Funny effect with steroids - didn't get me first tax, but was bounding around like Tigger this time! I hated the lower dose on FEC - made me feel shaky and funny, but taking a higher dose was very interesting! Let us know how you get on won't you Clare xx  ",

I have three teenage kids too and I am fully aware how much my diagnosis and treatment - particularly the chemo - has affected them all. I am a bit worried about how i will cope woth Tamoxifen next, but radiotherapy after should be a doddle, and I can think about going back to work (I think having me at home to nag more has got on the kids nerves too!).

My last chemo was 21st Sept, and I realised that my hair was starting to grow a couple of weeks ago. I used cold cap but have been wearing my wig since before last chemo as my hair was so thin you could see my scalp. Last Thursday I took the plunge and had all my wispy longer bits cut off and a no. 5 all over to even it up and trim off the baby hair. I am thrilled to bits with it, but haven't yet got the nerve to go commando!! Have set myself a target of wig-free by Christmas - should have a good amount by then at the rate it is growing. I was lucky and haven't lost all my eyebrows (got just enough to follow when using the eyebrow powder) or eyelashes (most of lower ones gone but upper not bad). Have just ordered the Eyelure falsies for the festive period after seeing recommendation on here - wouldn't normally use anything like that but as the advert says - we deserve it!!  Might just treat myself to the Benefit mascara too!!! Thanks!! And as for lady garden - haven't lost all that either - the bits that stayed were the bikini line bits - so had to shave them when went on holiday recently!! Bizarre!!  Am sure hair everywhere will start growing rampantly soon with the menopause effects of Tamoxifen - Movember will be easy next year!! It's great to be finally nearing end of treatment isn't it? I am on week 2 of rads. Having support and info from here has made a huge difference. Love to all Clare xx      ",

      "Content": "Hi All A late response to this, but haven't been on for a while and am excited about my hair! I used the cold cap throughout (had my long hair cut to a bob) and my hair gradually got thinner and thinner, even still falling out week before last. I found a heavier loss with Tax too (had FEC_T), and I finally had to give up, and started wearing my wig just before my final Tax 7 weeks ago. Anyway, had noticed a little bit of new growth 2 weeks ago which acelerated quickly. So last Thursday, I had my wispy longer bits cut off completely and a number 5 all over, to take off the soft baby hair. It looks amazing and I am thrilled to bits! I keep rubbing my hands over it - it feels lovely!! Quite a bit of grey, as expected, although I am lucky at 49 and am not too grey. Seems to be straight as before and not curly, thank goodness, and growing as strongly as ever. So-oooo exciting!!!! I haven't quite got the nerve yet to go out without my wig or a hat. I keep thinking I should be brave and go for the new look, but the whole point to me of using the cold cap and wearing a wig was that I do NOT want to look like a cancer patient, so I will let it grow a little longer yet, and keep my head warm with my wig! So the day WILL come and boy will it be exciting, I was bouncing on Thursday, ever and since!!!!! Clare xx  ",

      "Content": "Hi Lady Muck I have used cold cap through 3x FEC and 3x T, my last Tax was last Friday. Had long thick hair, cut into shoulder length bob pre chemo, which fell out lots but still looked like hair throughout the FEC. Tax hammered it further and it is now very noticeably thin. As the whole point to me was to try to keep hair and not look like a cancer patient, I have now started wearing my wig to go out. I am very happy that I used the cold cap as I have saved myself three months of wearing a wig, and hopefully will be able to stop wearing it earlier when my hair starts to grow and covers the thin patches. If you use cold cap, you will not be able to style your hair, or wash it frequently as others have said. The discomfort is a personal thing, but I agree that first few minutes are the worst. There are different types too. You could contact your chemo unit and find out which type. The nurses in my chemo unit weren't very keen on using it, and I had to ask and push for every aspect of it - they said I didn't need to wet my hair (although it is very obviously important) and didn't have a written protocol except for the instructions from the manufacturer - which took 20 minutes to find and print off on the first morning when I asked for it. I think I am a rarity on my unit to persist with it until the end and keep some hair! Good luck with your decision. As long as you're doing the right thing for you that's all that matters. Clare xx",

Kittycat - I had my hair trimmed last week too, just a tidy up - who would have thought it.

      "Content": "Hi ladies Have just started a thread about hating tax - have just come out from a week in hospital with neutropenia - so don't moan about the injections - definitely the better option!! I got them routinely for FEC (days 5-9), but not for Tax unless required, so I shall have them for next one. For those that don't know, they are a synthetic form of G-CSF - granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, known as filgrastim, and they stimulate the production of white blood cells, particularly neutrophils. Kittycat - glad your second one wasn't as bad as the first. Karen - hope you're doing ok on your second tax too. Luvvie - no sickness at all for me on tax, so hopefully much better for you Pat - love your wig story!!! No mouth sores, but did suck ice cubes - was shivering during treatment as cold cap as well but figured it was only an hour or so to save days of discomfort - and it was warm outside and I soon warmed up! My hair has started falling out more too, on the verge of needing to wear my wig now - tried it last night in the house and had to take it off afetr a couple of hours as it drove me mad - how do you stand to wear it all day??!! No hot flushes with Tax, had loads with FEC particularly in first week, easing to week 3 each time. The fatigue on Tax was different for me too. Wiped out on FEC but bounced back quick after Day 7; much more pyhsically affected with Tax and still much weaker 2 weeks on. Hopefully better next time!! Clare xx    ",

Last week was the usual horribleness, although the pain was quite a lot less and I managed without painkillers. This week I have managed to get out with the dog for quite decent distances. Had visitors yesterday and went suddenly shattered at tea-time and zombied all evening. Am fully prepared to be up and down for the next few weeks - have been warned by the chemo nurses and a friend who has been through it not to expect too much for 6 weeks. Will be on Tamoxifen by then, so will have those s/e's, and starting rads -  no rest for the wicked!! Hope all goes well for your surgery tomorrow - presumably they will double check bloods as you're feeling grotty, but at least you will be clearing the Tax out of your system as you recover from the the surgery. You'll be a new woman when you come out the other side!! Sue - I can sympathise with your abandoned feeling, but rest assured that they are so happy with your treatment and progress that they don't need to see you for ages! Could you speak to your your BCN about it? Maybe make an appt with her inbetween if it helps? Love to all Clare xx  ",

I started being rough Sun night, day 3, and had an awful day yesterday - stabbing pain in lower back and legs, head and neck, and surgery scars, as well as feeling weak and uncomfortable and about 110 yrs old - but not as washed out as on FEC. Also threw a crying wobbly at tea-time, which is not like me at all. Went on the Tramadol last night and have had the day in bed today, as each time I went downstairs I felt awful after just a few minutes. Also wanted to be fitter this evening as son's girlfriend's birthday and her family are away - we had takeaway pizza and birthday cake, in the balmy garden, and it was lovely. Two very different evenings! Had been trying to keep moving around and off the pills on Monday - but am much better for being on the pills and resting - sometimes it is right to just give in! Will be sensible the rest of the week. Mouth just cotton-woolly so far, sucked ice cubes during infusion after tips on here (was shivering by the time I'd done, with cold cap as well - thankfully it was sunny and I soon warmed up outside!) Good luck to kittycat and Sue for your next dose this week - think I've read the Tax reaction gets a bit better each time? Fingers crossed! Clare xx",

I have persevered with the cold cap, and it has now stopped shedding nearly 3 weeks after last tax. I can get away with a hat with hair sticking out underneath but have started wearing my wig without a hat as it is so very  thin. Don't regret using cold cap though as have got away without a wig for 3 months and have some hair, hopefully a good starting point for re-growth, although it will look very weird if it grows back curly with wispy straight bits!! Interestingly, my eyebrows and eyelashes didn't start to go until Tax, and still have some left, althouygh having to in-fill the eyebrows. Best of luck with your decision Clare xx  ",

If you write it from the point of view of what a horrible frightening effect it has had on you they should take it very seriously, and please do not think it will count against you because it should have them jumping through hoops to treat you better.

A friend who went through this told me she recovered from her 2nd tax after 2 weeks, but her 3rd one took 6 weeks! I too am not too bad with this one either - shattered and no energy as before (funny how it's a different shatteredness to FEC) but not much pain, only stabs and aches I can cope with, so managing to keep off painkillers. Can't wait to get my guts back to normal. Sassy, glad FEC not too bad, I can identify with 'obeying the chemo god' - then enjoying sticking two fingers up at it when you get back out and about for the rest of the cycle. Can't wait to erase the shadow of the chemo god (well perhaps devil more apt??!!) from my life completely!!! Hope last FEC goes ok and that Tax treats you reasonably Clare xx  ",

My hair is very thin now - you may have seen on other posts have started wearing my wig to go out - it makes me look so much healthier! Am hoping not to need wig for too long, as hoping hair will fill in when starts to grow - my only worry is if it starts to grow back curly as they say it can - that would look good - curly short growth with straight wispy shoulder length bob! I could start a new trend!!! So yours is growing back and still coming out?  Hope it soon gets on an even keel. Having it cut shorter sounds like a good idea.  Hope you're feeling great!

Can't do big meals, but tending to eat small and (very) often. Craving carbs - has to be a sandwich or cereals. Eating salad is torture - can't do it on its own, so tending to have a sandwich and salad as compromise. Not put weight on though, so just listening to my body and letting it eat what it needs. Not interested in wine until the third week, so letting myself have the odd glass then - sounds like we'll go right off it when we have T anyway! Think we are entitled to eat what we need to get through as well as what we feel is healthy  - a reasonable compromise! Clare xx",

This site is brilliant for info and support, ask any questions you like and there will be someone pointing the way! I didn't find it when very first diagnosed, wish i had. Good luck with the surgery. Give yourself time to recover. Do the stretches that they will give you, they really help. Great that you have a wonderful holiday to enjoy. Clare  ",

I have often thought how lucky I am to be going through this in spring/summer - well and autumn actually! To cope with it in the long dark winter would surely be harder. Yes, I was upset to no longer give blood. I had to cancel an appt when first diagnosed and he said he thought I may not be able to give blood again, then I got a 'final' certificate in the post a few days later! (Followed by a further appt the next day amusingly - one dept not speaking to another, I guess - typical NHS!!) Good idea to throw your efforts into fundraising - a friend of mine is organising a fashion show locally,  for breastcancercare - alot of hard work. Been looking at the Macmillan coffee morning on 28th Sept, but am due last chemo 1 week before, so don't know if i dare as if get delayed, it could be on that day. Would be good as 4 days prior is 21 yrs since my dad died of cancer and macmillan nurses were amazing. Clare xx    ",

Had a warm wheat bag on my arm for the 3rd FEC and it was much easier. 2 weeks after 3rd FEC, veins are tightening up again and I keep stretching. I can see and feel the veins all the way up my arm, and can't quite fully straighten it yet - but I will! I understand Tax isn't as bad on the veins, so sympathy to all having/had 6xFEC. Just another side effect we weren't warned about!!  Clare xx    ",

She is not giving up on you, she is just badly organised and not very good at communicating!! You know as we all do that this is not a straight and predictable path. If you really want to know all your options, write to her (or even better, her boss - that'll make them sit up) and say that you want a consultation to discuss your prognosis and options. However, she may not be able to give you a clear outcome at this stage, things will probably be clearer when you have finished your chemo. You are so fortunate to be responding well to the chemo, focus on that for now and accept that more answers may take time in coming Lots of love Clare xx",

      "Content": "Hi Annie Hope your queasiness is dissipating. Managed to get my last FEC done yesterday, after my week delay. Taking it very steady this morning and ok so far - feels great to reach reach the halfway point and be done with FEC, but a little trepidadtion about Tax! You can insist that you see your consultant Onc, make sure you never see that useless registrar again. Are you being seen again before your next dose? If so, ring and make sure the Cons onc is there- he may not have been present at the clinic, and they may have thought it ok to be seen by a reg for a review - which you clearly aren't! When you get to the clinic make it clear that you will only see the Consultant - they will probably tell you that you might wait longer, but it sounds worth it. Or if i were you, and you can face another consultation, contact your onc secretary and tell her the trauma you have had and ask for an urgent appt - they should help. Working in the NHS, I do know that if you kick up a fuss (nicely helps, but be stroppy if you have to) it definitely helps when the wheels are not tuning as they should. Your onc may well be annoyed himself. If still not happy, definitely get a second opinion. Clare xx  ",

      "Content": "Hi All I am also having trouble with my veins on my good arm after only 2x FEC. Started with a dull ache in my inner elbow  2 weeks after first chemo, very painful going in second round and ached badly since, and started to tighten up like cording. Onc told me last week to stretch the veins, just like I had to with bad cording. Have been stretching and they are a little better, but very painful to stretch and not looking forward to next chemo. Onc said nothing i can apply topically to help, but am wondering about arnica or suchlike. No warning about this - am p'ed off as i thought i would keep one good side, and it's my dominant hand! More and more things to add to the fun! Clare",

I am now  weeks past chemo and discussed getting away at half term before rads with my oncologist - he told me to go abroad if i want !!! Said if i can't get travel insurance, just go in EU and take EHIC card. So, I have today booked us a week in Portugal in 6 days time!!!!! can't wait!!!! Hubby and teenagers need a break as much as i do!! Incidentally, American Express have covered me for my BC and my asthma for £96 for the year (rest of family total is £70) - thought that wasn't bad, as thought no-one would touch me as mid-treatment. Also wondering where to go for 50th birthday next year - it will be a couple of weeks after my 1 year diagnosis anniversary, so got to plan something special! Get that holiday booked and get on with normal life!!! Clare  ",

I got them for my 3xFEC, but was told not unless required for T. Well after a week in hopsital with neutropenia afetr 1st T, I now have them after my second T which was yesterday. Have been told to start them on Day 2 as well, it was Day 5-9 previously. I had some bone/joint pain with them last time but not too bad. Although given a toss up beteween the pain and the neutropenia - pain ain't as likely to kill ya!!  I am not mega Keen on doing mine - actually my hubby is gentler than me, but just remember to pinch the skin and stick it in there - I forgot to pinch on my last lot and it really hurt, then remembered and it was a doddle!
