      "Content": "hi everyone, I have posted a few times on here. My mum had breast cancer 11 years ago aged 51, and has lost 2 sisters to breast cancer who were in their 40's. Mum was diagnosed with colon (stage 2) & ovarian (stage 3) cancer last July, and is now palliative after the chemo to shrink the ovarian tumour was unsuccessful. Mum has had numerous tests for BRCA, HNPCC plus the known genetic abnormalities, which have all come back negative. Now Genetics are undertaking an exome sequencing study of her dna to see if they can find a genetic abnormality. Does anyone know anything about this particular study? many thanks Justine",

      "Content": "hi everyone, I'm not sure if this is the right area to post in, but would love to hear from anyone with similar family history, and advice. My mum had breast cancer 10 years ago, we are already under Genetics clinic as mum was the third sister to have breast cancer (2 sisters passed away in their 40's). Mum has just been diagnosed with Ovarian & Bowel cancer (both primaries, dual pathology) aged 61 (10 years after her breast cancer diagnosis). So far the BRCA tests have been NEGATIVE although they are pretty sure it is genetic. Mum's Ovarian cancer was discovered after she had a bowel obstruction, which is how they found the bowel cancer, and the ovarian cancer was diagnosed at the same time. The bowel cancer was completely removed, but the ovarian cancer has spread, and is in the lymph nodes. The genetics clinic are very interested as it is not common to have 2 cancers at the same time, and apparently there is a link between ovarian & bowel possibly too. I am very worried at this point, as not only am I now classed as high risk for breast, but could be for ovarian and bowel. I am due to start having annual breast screening in 3 years time when I'm 40. Without the gene being identified neither myself, my daughter, or the other female cousins in the family can be tested. Anyone else out there with this kind of cancer cluster, but no gene identified as yet? thanks",
