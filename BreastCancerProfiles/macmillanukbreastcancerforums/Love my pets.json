    "Content": "Hi Sue, hope you are doing well, I am 6months in on tomoxifen and my hair has rapidly turned grey, well it would if i let it. I had a few grey hairs and colored it myself but now I have a full head of grey roots and now my hair dresser colors my roots every 4 weeks. I have very thick natural curly hair so it\u2019s hard to keep up to. Thinking of going for a funky short style next year for my 50th and let it go grey. Think tomoxifen has definitely aged me.   Diane xx ",
