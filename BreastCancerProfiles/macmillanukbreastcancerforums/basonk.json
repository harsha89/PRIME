      "Content": "Hi Helen,  Thank you for replying to my post . When I am rational I know that you are right and we cannot assume that everything is set in stone re treatment . I think that I was shocked as my consultant had previously told me everything was totally fine and I had the best possible outcome as I didn't need chemo . I think that I had then internally rejoiced and began to get on with everything . Yesterday being thrown a curveball was not even an option in my head as I thought I knew what was happening . If they had said previously that they \"thought\" that RT was the way forward but that they would test the cells further then I would have been emotionally ready . What interests me is where on earth has my tumour been for 4 weeks !!!!! In a jar on a shelf or in a freezer - .  Onwards and upwards xx",

      "Content": "Hi Amanda, Thank you for your reply. Firstly I hope that you are ok and are ready for your RT soon you will be better .  I think that we are all scared of ever hearing that we have the dreaded C , even though it is sadly so common. So we try hard to prepare ourselves and everyone around us .  I am still holding out hope that I will come back with a low score as I understand how brutal chemo is . I also am realistic and appreciate that if I need chemo then I will get myself through it . Good luck with your treatment I hope it all goes well.  xx",

      "Content": "Hi everyone, I'm lying awake feeling a little shell shocked. I was diagnosed with breast cancer 6 weeks ago and 4 weeks ago had surgery to remove the lump and lymph ducts . When I went back to get my results the surgeon said it was all good news - grade 2 ,hormone thingy! , lymph ducts negative and clear margins - she said I would require hormone treatment and radiotherapy........ great news under the circumstances. Today was my appointment with oncology , I thought this would (as I had been advised) be to discuss the type of hormone treatment and whether I was ready to start radiotherapy. However, the oncologist dropped the bombshell that my tumour would be sent to the US (with my permission) and tested further as she felt I may require chemo- she said they were unable to get full depth clear margin on part of the tumour, I was left shaking as I was totally unprepared for this as I thought the plan was already decided . Am I just over reacting ? ",

However, last night I very much focussed on my own self pity and anger ; a place where I don't need to be - thank you and I hope that your treatment is going well ....one step at a time xx",

      "Content": "Hi Jo, You are so right , they are just treating us like they treat hundreds of people every day , it's \"normal\" but to us it is a shock initially . I just need to remain positive and realise everything is being done to help me .  I just am one of those people who wants to know what is happening and when it will happen then I'm ready and can get on with it . Last year I had half my thyroid removed as that had a tumour so I'm getting used to it. I just think I must have reached the end of my warranty at age 40 lol .  Good luck with your ongoing treatment . One step at a time xx",

I'm sure that they are only making sure that they are doing everything that they can.  The results will take two weeks, I guess that is partly why I got stressed about it , in two weeks time I had imagined that I would be halfway through RT.  Kerry x",
