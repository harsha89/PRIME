    "Content": "I am 59. My cancer was diagnosed after a routine mamogram so it cam as a total shock as ther ewas not lump to feel it was right at the back. When asked what my biggest fear was I said a mastectomy, never even occurred to me friends were worried I might die. An way after 2 lumpectomies I had still had pre-cancerous cells so I finally admitted to myself  that I had to have a mastectomy although it took me 5 months to decide.  I was lucky to be able to have immediate re-construction as the cancer hadn't spread to my lymph nodes. I had a tram flap where fat is taken from your tummy but 12 hours after the operation I developed a haematoma, and ended up being rushed back to theatre and lost the flap so at the moment I am now waiting to have an expander implant. Have you checked if you will be able to have this done later? I am 34E. The literature all say they are not suitable for large breasts and older women but my consultant says that is rubbish. The other breast can be reduced to match. There are marvellous prosthesis available on the NHS and don't be afraid  to ask to change. I now have a stick on which matches my real one perfectly so I can wear a normal bra,  and one to wear in a pocketed bra. I hate them both of course and they have been thrown across the bedroom more than once but they do look good. I bought a special beanie boob for swimming and went on the beach in Spain only weeks after my operation feeling confident Don't try to be brave I have bad days where I hate everyone for being OK and have been unbearable to work with people understand.Take any help offered my friends and people at work have been fantastic. I even resorted to anti-depressants never thought I would go down that road but they help. At least you are realistic about getting rid of the cancer I wasn't.  This is my first time on the web site but if can help  I will look out for your messages",
