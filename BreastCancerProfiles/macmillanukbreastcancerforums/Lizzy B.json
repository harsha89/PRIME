My surgery is 12th Jan, I have been offered lumpectomy or removal by breast reduction, I am a small frame with H to HH cup, I have to have radiotherapy but have no idea about chemo as the consultant wont know if its gone to my lymph nodes until the op, they look ok under ultrasound, but who knows? I have been put on Leterzole, my cancer is lobular, anyone else out there had same dilemma ?. My other breast will be reduced after all radiotherapy etc to allow it to settle down and get best match. I m going insane with the worry and decisions, would be grateful to hear if others had same, how do you decide?",

      "Content": "Hi Forestsidelady, thank you for your reply. I have the choice of three options, lumpectomy, removal by reduction of mastectomy, as I've witnessed my ex sister in law go through lumpectomy and have really side effects, I no were are all different, and as the cancer I have is Lobual, so more likely to return or go into the other breast, if it returns to the effected breast as I have to have 3 weeks radiotherapy, they would have to them perform a mastectomy anyway, so im thinking why would I risk putting myself through this twice?. but then as consultant said, it may not come back. I'm 58, do I want to be doing this in 2, 5 or 10 years time? I thought if I just have the mastectomy but I would want reconstruction at same time, I'm a small frame but a 36HH cup!!! How did the operation go for you ? And what was the healing process like? I'm more scared of what I'm going to look like than having the cancer, how stupid is that. My family although supportive, because my cancer is small, I don't think realise the enormity of it and the long term impact that it will have on me.I think they think its an op a bit of radiotherapy and then all's well, its the constant worry I have to live with of is it back. My thoughts are a mastectomy would reduce the chance of it returning, my surgery is scheduled for the 12th Jan my diagnosis was on the 25th November, so I've had a lot of time to get myself confused.com!!! I have been put on Leterzole. I hope you had a great Christmas, many thanks for sharing your story",

      "Content": "Thanks for reply, mines small but its invasive, due to where it is they would have to lift nipple anyway, I was offered breast reduction years ago, but its pretty brutal and I worked on the theory it wasn't broken so don't fix it!!!! Now its broken. The removal by reconstruction is obviously a bigger op, and due to my being big busted the thought of one big, one small, which seems petty on the scale of saving it from spreading and my life. But as the possibility of chemo is not known, I could be looking at 12 months if I have to have chemo before I'm made even again, and that's if it hasn't gone anywhere else, if I took the lumpectomy thev'e still gotta lift my nipple, the radiotherapy is worse on big breasts than small, so if I had the reduction the side effects may be less, I just dont know which way to go. Because I dont know if its reached my lymph nodes, its like getting on a ride without knowing what it is.",
