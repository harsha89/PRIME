    "Content": "Hi Myshitit!  Fab name & well done for raising all that money with your headshave!!  I just had my 4th FEC yesterday, I haven't been too bad with side effects. Tiredness the first week & never know what I fancy eating (usually fish finger buddies go down a treat on the first Saturday after). I have had mouth ulcers, but the hospital give me a prescription for mouth wash, which has really helped.  Did get really bad heartburn on my 3rd one but was away for a few days and think all the bad living didn't help, was telling the oncologist yesterday and she give me the tablets we have to take for 5 days for our stomach for the whole of the 21 days to see if will help!  I really did have such a worry about starting the chemo, but I have to be honest it has not been as bad as what I thought, by the end of the 2 week I'm having a few drinks and by the 3rd, eating & drinking like a fish!  Good luck for the rest of your chemo and for all the ladies out there in our journey that we all wished we never had to take!! Ps...not annoyed at all that I should have been in Berlin tonight watching U2! Big hugs Maggie x",
