      "Content": "Wonderful suggestions, Leolady. I may have to use some of them.  I also had the \"what a lovely shaped head you have\" comment. I was speechless. But my real favourites were \"You're so lucky you have an excuse not to do the ironing\" (which of course makes it all worthwhile) and \"Phttt, what do they know?\" when I told a friend of my incurable diagnosis. She had been pressing for details, said she wanted to know how I really was so she could support me fully. I suspect the problem is that most people don't how to respond, but want to give some kind of positive reassurance. They feel pressured to say something upbeat, and sometimes what comes out is just ridiculous. What does make me laugh, though, is the reaction to my new chemo crop hairstyle. It is actually better than what I had before. People twist themselves in knots by starting to say how well it suits me, then backing off, afraid they'll be implying that my old style looked bad. But this really is miles better.",

      "Content": "Hi, Vicki, I've been on Capecitabine since September. 6 cycles done, 2 to go. It's really not too bad, at least for me. It's really giving my blood a pounding, though - I've had to have 2 transfusions (one followed by a 2 week delay in treatment) due to low blood counts, and just scraped over the limits on another couple of occasions. Both times, it was extreme fatigue and breathlessness that let me know I was in trouble. My neutrophils were low, but I didn't catch anything worse than a cold! Most other side effects, for me, have been mild, and easily treated. I've had nausea, diarrhoea and a sore mouth/bad taste. They were all much less severe than when I had EC/T chemo last year. I have some neuropathy in my hands and feet, left over from then, and it hasn't been aggravated by the Cape. My skin became very dry, so I moisturise all over every day. Time consuming, but hardly the end of the world. I use Doublebase gel, which is non-greasy and absorbs quickly. I've kept my newly regrown hair. The one new side effect, hand-and-foot syndrome, is the worst, but is also manageable. My skin blistered and peeled slightly during the second cycle, which was also when my blood counts hit rock bottom. My oncologist reduced the dosage from 4000mg daily to 3600, and I bought lots of Udderly Smooth cream from Amazon. (Yup, it was initially made for cows, to treat chafing caused by milking machines, but is now sold for humans.) It's brilliant stuff. I use lots - I think it's been a full tub per cycle - but it keeps the skin from cracking, and creating a risk of infection. I slather it on and put cotton socks/gloves on top. My hands and feet can be very sore, which limits what I can do, but as I said, it's manageable. As for what to do, the most important thing seems to be keeping as close as you can to the schedule. Take the pills 12 hours apart, within half an hour of eating. I went back and checked this with the pharmacist because it seemed unusually rigid, and she confirmed that it's important. So I set my alarm and get up for a very early breakfast so that dinner doesn't have to be too late in the day. You already know about avoiding grapefruit.  I try to exercise every day, although that has been harder towards the end of these last 2 cycles. Apart from the general health benefits, current research says that exercising makes chemo more effective. If it helps delay the return of the beast, I'm all for it. I used to walk a lot, but the sore feet preclude that, so now I use a gym and I just started swimming again. I think that covers everything. Sorry about the essay! Good luck. Let me know how you get on.",

      "Content": "You're absolutely right, Shaz, that is an abnormally long wait. Every patient is unique, and we all have different treatment plans, so there may well be a reason for the delay in your case. Unfortunately, it's also possible that someone has made a mistake and you've been overlooked. So  don't worry too much, but do chase it up, and don't stop pushing until you get a satisfactory answer. Good luck.",
