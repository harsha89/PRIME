      "Content": "I had a mastectomy in December with immediate reconstruction by diep flap.   I have to say for me it was a good decision, I was up the next day, only used morphine pump as a tester and when being moved from recovery to the ward as a precaution, really never found the pain that bad.  I would also add generally I am always cold, so was not distressed at being kept warm after surgery.  I got a seroma which had to be drained, but bought a tighter fitting sports bra which seemed to stop it recurring. I went back to work three weeks after surgery, I did a lot of walking and felt really quite well by four weeks and was swimming at six weeks.   However I have found chemo a lot more difficult, I start vomiting whilst actually receiving chemo despite Emend and various other anti sickness drugs, and vomit multiple times most days I have struggled with white blood cells being to low and having to delay treatment.  The veins in my arm are in a state  and I ache all over, so I guess we're all different - I have two sessions left and can't wait to hopefully get back to being me. Good luck with your treatment, and I really hope if you have immediate reconstruction its goes well for you too.",

      "Content": "I tried cold cap, but never got started as my head is apparently too big for largest cap they had, which would have left me with a Mohican look, so decided baldness here we come! (I do have a large crown, but do not believe I have an abnormally sized head.) Although I have had immediate reconstruction there is more to go, but can't be completed until I've finished chemo.   The shape is good, does mean can wear neckline I choose, not keen on scaring, and obviously you get scarring from where tissue taken as well. For me mentally waking up to find something rather than nothing helped my recovery, but I think there is no escaping the mental torment of life/me not being the same again, but I fully intend to try to get as close as I can once chemo finished, joys of tamoxifen to come.  I don't think I would have gone back for reconstruction, but I have been told even with immediate reconstruction there are on average two to three surgeries.  Physically I'm not where I was, but I think now that's more due to chemo than surgery, At 6 weeks when I started swimming could feel internal pulling in stomach but I think could have worked through that, but I've  had to stop swimming until immune system recovers. I planning my freedom at the end of June!",
