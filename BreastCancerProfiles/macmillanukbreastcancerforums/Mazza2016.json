      "Content": "Hi, I was diagnosed with Grade 1 Invasive Ductal Cancer that was picked up on routine mammogram. It is small but because my fear is not small I have requested a bilateral mastectomy. Am I the only woman to ever make this request? I have been told I must see a Psychologist but the Breast Team do not know where to send me. The process is therefore being delayed by several weeks while they find someone and then book me an appointment. I have been left in limbo and am beginning to lose faith in the Breast Team that I have seen. Does anyone have any suggestions please?",

      "Content": "Thanks. My reaction is not knee jerk as I have always said that I would have a mastectomy if I ever got breast cancer.  I haven't changed my mind and when told they did not know who to refer me to  I found an appropriate professional and the CNS refused to use the details. I am used to organising but they are not including me. As an operating theatre nurse I know exactly what the different types of surgery are, never expected it to be me on the table but we never do.",

      "Content": "Hi Julia,  thanks for your answer.  My surgeon is reluctant to do the mastectomy for me. I accepted that he needed to be sure that I really want to go for it but feel they are trying to manipulate me and do not listen. A bad start to a horrible journey.  Glad you got there in the end.  Take care.  X",
