Yes I blame docs for everything, almost in my 6 th week and still can only walk 40 metres without a big rest yes, the train landed on top of me and no one yet knows how to get it off me REST! Last of the chemo gone, now for radiation and they say it can cause fatigue!!! Omg! And yes I lost finger nails and toe nails, but I lost a little weight, that is good. I wish you well and no side effects!",

      "Content": "Hello to all, Hope this message finds everyone fighting their battle easier than yesterday. My concern is that I finished my last chemo (docetaxel) 6 weeks ago, I am to start radiation next Tuesday. I am terrified that I am going to be in worse condition than I am now, I haven't worked since last dose, using my long service leave now, so I worry about that also. Docs has angrily affected my leg muscles where walking and standing for long is impossible, I have been told that it takes time...but I can't afford the time off work, very depressed. I feel I have coped well with mastectomy, the loss of hair, finger and toe nails, neoropathy in feet and hands, but exhaustion is so debilitating physically and plays havoc emotionally! I understand there is no answers here, but I do feel a little better having put it out there on paper. Thank you and I truely wish everyone on this forum well.",
