      "Content": "Hi I have only been taking Anastrazole for 3 days and this afternoon I have had a great deal of pain in my knee, hip and back. I know that this is one of the side effects but didn't know if it worked that quickly or if the pain is from something else. Anybody else had pain this quickly?",

      "Content": "Hi I have been on Anastrozole since the 27th May. For the past three days my feet and ankles have been swollen by the end of the day. They do sometimes swell when the weather is warm, but go down again overnight. This time they are going down but no clearing completely. Could this be a side effect from the tablets? Does anyone else have this? Should I go to my Doctor or call my BCN? All replies appreciated. xx",

Have you undergone any treatment yet? Have they given you any options for treatment or is it too far advanced for that. I am so sorry for you, but hope that the girls ( and men) on here can reassure you by sharing their experiences. Thinking of you xxx",

      "Content": "Morning Margym I have got my planning appointment on Monday 8th. I have got to have rads every day for three and a half weeks, but hey we get weekends off for good behaviour as my oncologist said! Yay!! I too am hoping to keep working through and am going to ask for an early morning start or a late afternoon one. Our hospital give appointments as late as 7pm! don't think I would like it that late. I find working helps keep me going, I even went back a week early after my op (only after I had asked the surgeon) and it really cheered me up as I work with a great team and we have a laugh and a giggle every day. Good luck to you both xx",

Can anyone tell me why I am getting pain in my left underarm, is this just a coincidence do you think?? Apart from this I am feeling fine and positive, due to start rads the week after next.",
