      "Content": "Hi julie...... I read your posting with interest because I faced a similar decision last year. I was diagnosed in April 2008 with invasive lobular cancer, deep against my chest wall. I had a full right mastectomy and lymph node sampling..... Fortunatly, there was no sign of spread. I then discussed my options at length with my Onc. He was very insistent that I should have rads followed by chemo. I could see the sense in rads, in case there were any stray cells not removed by surgery, but not the chemo for a number of reasons........ When I asked for statistics he told me that chemo would only improve my chances of no reocccurance over 10 years by around 5 to 10%....... Not a lot of incentive to go ahead with such a gruelling, punishing treatment....... A close family friend had chemo ..... Her immune system became so weak that she was unable to fight off illness and died of pneumonia. To me, it's madness to pump my body full of poisonous chemicals, but that's just my personal opinion and everyone is different . Some people are reassured by taking every possible treatment, others may need it because they have spread. Anotherfactor for me was that I could not afford to take any more time off work, or I would have ended up on benefits and lost my home more than likely ... I am a single mum with no partner or savings to fall back on and didn't want my kids to lose their home. I think this is a very individual decision for everyone. You have to decide what's best for YOU. I was bullied constantly by my onc over a number of weeks, he was determined I should have chemo and got rather stroppy when I stuck to my guns!!!! Take your time and good luck, whatever you decide. If you want to pm me, please do! Radish x",
