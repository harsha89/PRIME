The last one - last week, well, I dont know if it is the euphoroa of it being the last one but my se have not been nearly so bad. I was not only awake on Sunday but also did a Sainsburys shop, (I didnt dare drive tho, Chemo brain!). Last time I couldnt put one foot in front of the other until a full week after! My aching bones and joints have been minimal too. I had injections for 5 days rather than the one big injection after all my tax, it may be worth asking if this makes a difference to your se. Now this could all be that I was expecting the absolute worst after number 5 which was awful, however this is me. You need to make the right choice for you, however once you have made that choice, whatever it is, dont beat yourself up over it and think \"what if\", it will drive you crazy if you do that. I am sure you will make the right decision. All good wishes, positive thoughts and cyber hugs at this horrid time.",

Is it normal to have what I can only describe as a mini breast after surgery? That's what it looks like when I look down, which means that I have a tiny bit of cleavage which I am delighted about. I can't help thinking though that this will make my prosthesis a bit uncomfortable when the time comes. I'm wearing a \"comfy\" at the mo which is okay. Have any of you ladies experienced similar?

We were advised by one of his colleagues that this cover pays us for using the NHS for oncology day patient appointments rather than using private facilities. It would be the same for any condition if we elected NHS over private. It is frustrating dealing with them never speaking or being able to speak to the same person twice, and they don't come to us to advise they need additional paperwork, we call or email them to chase and they say \"oh you need to send us this\" but hopefully we are nearly there.

It sounds horrid doesn't it! I have to take steroids twice a day for 3 days starting tomorrow then I have to inject myself after, can't remember for how long. I've resisted googling and stuck to the discussions on this site, not sure though they are any less scary but they are more trustworthy. I think all we can do is exactly the same as on FEC. Go in with an open mind and just deal with whatever it throws at us and hope to goodness we get away just as lightly! I'm not sure what effect this has on our hair. I've got some eyebrows left from FEC and eyelashes but that's it. It's weird, I'm more worried about losing those than I was about losing my hair. I've not had mx yet, I've still got that left to look forward to. Lets hope we get some positive feedback and if we do feel poorly its just for the first week like FEC.

The chemo nurse gave me nerve pain killers to take if the joint pain kicks in but said I could take paracetamol or ibuprofen first if I didn't think it was too bad but not to hesitate to take her painkillers if I needed to. The Pre loaded syringes have to be kept in the fridge and taken out half an hour before use, recommended to inject at 4 pm as it is a little less disruptive to your sleep pattern .

As others have said, your immunity will be very low after your chemo starts so I would suggest you take this time off so as to be as fit as you can be to prepare for battle! You have not got time to be poorly and fully recover by the 4th, and after mentally preparing yourself for treatment the last thing you want is for it to be delayed! Keep doing your arm exercises which will help with muscle strength and the healing should be well on the way before your chemo starts.

Unfortunately there is nothing you can do to make it go away. I used to hold my mx site when I got up from sitting or lying down, as the gush of fluid was sooo weird it made me feel quite sick sometimes. My breast unit were reluctant to drain it because of the risk of infection, when it was time for my rads planning I went into panic mode thinking I would die if rads were delayed but in the end, they just drained it every other day for rads treatment. The upside is that it gave me a cleavage, the fluid now seems to have been replaced by scar tissue and I am left with a moob, which is no problem at all and I still have a cleavage. I am just waiting for a breast reduction on my healthy breast and all will be well. Stick with it my lovely, it's just another step you will soon be over on this mountain we have to climb Tokes x",

I then had a full body bone scan and a CT scan to see if any cells had gone AWOL, all clear thankfully. From then on in all discussions I am having a full node clearance. How do they know already that I need this, or is it that different oncologists just have different views and some examine at the time of surgery and some just get rid if there has been any trace of cancer cells? I'm an \"if it ain't broke don't fix it\" kinda girl, however if there would even be an outside chance of dormant cells.nestling in my nodes then I'm all for taking them all!

I do understand your devastation tho because since the beginning you have been advised one thing, made a plan in your head, organised your life around that plan and then bang, suddenly there is no plan any more. From the beginning I was told I could have an immediate recon with my MX, then Mr Plastic said I had to wait a year for it. Like you I am a big girl up top and I was devastated that for a year I am going to be lopsided at best, no cleavage and stuck with a prosthesis. I was not happy. My partner understood my frustration but not the extent of it. He doesn't care what I look like, he's just glad I'm here to tell the tale. I'm sure that's what your husband means, he just can't express it properly. Men don't get it, but sometimes we forget they have been thru hell too and to them, uneven boobs is a small price to pay to still have us alive. I have to say tho, the \"it's a small price to pay\" comments don't wash with me too well. I know that, don't need to hear it when all I want is to have a cleavage and 2 boobs! When you get over the shock you will feel a little better about it. Still as mad as hell but a little better. You might not need a full size prosthesis, just enough to give you a lift. Whatever you have, you will learn to live with it because that's what we do. As if having BC is not enough to emotionally deal with we then have physical stuff to deal with too, and because we are larger busted ladies, it seems insurmountable at times. But you know what, we can do it,. We have been through the nasty stuff, we just have to learn to think differently to get through this bit. Cyber hugs to you {{{{{{{hugs}}}}}}}",
