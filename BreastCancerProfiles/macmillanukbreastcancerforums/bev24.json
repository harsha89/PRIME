      "Content": "Hi Carol.  Thank you for replying.   I have gained a few Kilos. I think it's the sugar cravings. Because when I feel sick I found shortbread and flapjacks helped before I took my steroids as I was feeling sick I could not take the pills. Then on.my third week I had a cooking spree cooking cakes and cheesecake. I don't know how to stop that craving. I hope after this second infusion I don't crave sugar.  Looking back on it I see I was mental to do that. Lesson learned I think.  Hope you are doing ok. Thanks again Bev x",

But have to do what ever is in my power be looking like me as much as possible. Please has anyone gained so much weight on chemo  I am dreaded in this most of all I think because I feel it is nothing I can do about it. Or is there.? I have suffered with weight since I was 20 and I hate putting the weight on as I can battle and battle to get it off as I feel I am not in control with anything anymore.   I have been told the steroid are the culprit for this. Has anyone dieted whilst on chemo? Unfortunately the only diet that's worked for me in the past is shake meals with evening cooked meal.dont know if it is allowed. Do any of you go exercise too?  Has anyone battled with weight and managed to prevent it while on chemo. I would be absolutely appreciate your support and advice. Will love Bev thank you all and speedy recovery to all xx",

I must admit since being diagnosed cancer in December I have not done any expertise.  Partly because I had two ops sinc January and then the chemo started. Had my second FEC yesterday and swore to myself that as soon as I feel up to it I will walk on my treadmill that is collecting dust. Even if for only 10 mins I know I will feel the benefit. It's just making that move. As for the shakes I. Think you are probably right and try to to it the right way as and when I can eat.

I am stopping the tramadol because of the effects it gives me. I will try other drugs especially for next time. This is now day 8 and the pains are still there. To top it all I am coming out with spots or cuts which ever they are and one is getting infected and pussy. So a new side effect that no one has mentioned yet.  I will have to see GP for this and hope they have something that works. Again thank.you and Wanderer good luck with a mammogram.  I also had news today which upset me is my sisters mother in law is diagnosed with brain cancer. She is 84. The sad thing is she has mastectomy and chemo and rads last year and was getting better. But sadly a new cancer has got her this year. So.she opted out of treatment as it is far too aggressive and she can't take any more treatment. So what I am saying to all is good luck and find good health because you just don't know what is round the corner... Love to all Bev x",

But by the time I get zapped again I'm back to square one. So if any of you are doing these diets while on chemo I would appreciate some help to decide whether to join or not.

Don't know if this is normal or whether it was the tablet. I have not taken any this morning as I have also had a bad head and making me feel sick. Again don't know if this is normal or the tablet  Is anyone taking this painkiller and are you having simular effects. Otherwise will have to go back to GP I guess. I also am breaking out in spots on my shoulder and one is pussing  ( sorry not nice) ;-( because I don't heal now it hurts white alot.
