      "Content": "Hi Pat One of my biggest and best things throughout this whole process has been my husband, hes the only one to actually still make me see that I am still me as you have said, he still takes the mick out of me for some of my classic 'miss says' and I do have a few slips.  He also doesn't let me get too down with the whole 'Hair' loss experience, he makes sure that I can still laugh about the whole thing.  I go to pick up my wig tomorrow so will let you know just how that went.   Jac xxx",

      "Content": "Hi Everyone, I hope your wedding goes really well and even if you do have to wear your wig I bet you still look stunning. Its seems like I might have been an unlucky person, I started to lose my hair two weeks after having my first FEC treatment.  Got my lovely Sister In Law to chop it short as it was getting me down with the constant falling out.  But that wasn't the end, looks like it wasn't going to be happy till I had that lovely number 1 look.  Wish I could say it was a completely happy out come but I was pretty gutted when I had to look at myself with no hair.  Its seems I was pretty much attached to my lovely blonde long hair, get my wig soon but not sure how I feel about that.  I have several pretty scarfs which are ok, but cant wait till this is all finished and my poor hair starts to grow again. ",
