      "Content": "Although I am fortunate enough not to have had chemo after my mastectomy for bc, I had to come off HRT and the hot flushes came back. I had previously stopped HRT and then couldn't stand them and went back on and was feeling good again when I got my diagnosis. I bought a LadyCare magnet and only get about three a day now, without the panic attack. Don't know how it works, but worth trying. Only costs Â£20 and can be bought online through LadyCare. Good luck with your treatment. Linda",
