      "Content": "Hi, i'm hoping someone can help...I have very extensive nerve damage from chemo (likely v bad reaction to Taxotere). I am usually quite good with pain but I am finding the pain to be increasingly unbearable. I'm currently being treated for a recurrence and I am managing the other symptoms very well (even managing to exercise a few times a week and work odd days a week and from home) but finding the pain almost unbearable. I have been given painkillers which are hardly touching the sides lately. Is this just something people put up with? I just want to be knocked out now. Has anybody been in this position before? How did you control it? I'm completely losing the plot, not sleeping and feeling so detached from my once amazing life and can't see how i'm ever going to feel normal again (i'm 27)  any advice or help would be really appreciated ",

I was Grade 3 so began treatment immediately - mastectomy, chemo and radiotherapy. I had a TRAM Flap reconstruction after I had completed my treatment as the option of reconstruction before/during treatment wasn't an option.  It's such a personal choice (and one which only you can make) but I just wanted rid of them. Funnily enough (and I hope this will prove to be the same for you) losing my boobs wasn't actually that traumatic and I can't relate to people who say they lost a part of their identity etc (although I understand totally how they can, i'm not in any way belittling other peoples' emotions).  If there is anything specific i can help with, please just ask. xxx",

Have you asked about having both removed if you are concerned? After diagnosis, i underwent about the mastectomy, 6 months of chemo (mainly taxotere) and radiotherapy (can't remember how long exactly, sorry). Your treatment may be shorter, bear in mind that my tumour was extremely aggressive. I had the reconstruction (a Tram Flap) about a year after treatment ended and with this process they do one breast at a time because it's quite a tricky process (there are a few options with far shorter recovery times so dont worry about this). The Tram recon just seemed like the best option to me as I felt oddly squeamish about implants and I have to say that people are often very shocked when i tell them they aren't strictly 'real'. A diagnosis is an enormous shock and if i could give you one bit of advice it would be this: don't Google! There is a wealth of useless, scary and unhelpful information on the internet about breast cancer in us 20-somethings. Write a list of questions for your oncologist and take a pen and paper with you to jot down the answers. I wish i'd have done this - I didn't tell my parents because I wanted to know exactly what the situation was before i told them to minimise their worry but in the end all that happened what that i didn't take any of the info' in! I won't lie and tell you this will be a picnic; it absolutely isn't. But the gut-wrenching shock and terror does subside and you will be surprised at how strong you are. Much love xxxx    ",

A big misconception is that a cancer patient has no control over their treatment.  One thing though and I don't mean to panic you but it might be worth enquiring about fertility issues: sometimes they can harvest eggs or put ovaries to sleep. I have heard horror stories of this being accidentily skipped, so do ask what your options are. I had eggs harvested and fertilised and my boyfriend and I (we've been together over 5 years) are very conforted by our 7 ebryo's camping out in some freezer somewhere! Hope you dont think i'm adding to your worry here, just offering advice that i would have appreciated.

      "Content": "Hi eveyone, I am 27 and have just had a recurrence of BC (first diagnosed at 24, had mastectomy then too). I found out about the recurrence a few months ago and since the Dr. is very positive I am keeping quite calm.  My question is daft but simple...how do you answer the \"how are you?\" question? Thus far (unless to close friends and family of course) i just say \"fine thanks, how are you?\". I am not being treated with chemo (yet) and look actually ok physically so I think a lot of people assume that i feel ok. Not always the case but i'm not after sympathy so this doesn't bother me.  I am just finding it increasingly difficult to maintain this answer with some people (mainly at work, gym instructor (had to tell her because i have to 'sit out' a couple of sets due to nerve pain etc etc). Just curious as to what you guys say in response to these questions? I just feel like i am burdening people with annoying/unwanted/depressing info if i tell them the truth or even mention in passing anything to do with my cancer when they ask the \"how are you?\" question as I appreciate that it often means the same as 'hello'!. But i am very conscious that some people are very curious and even a bit intrigued because I never reveal too much and I know the \"how has your week been\" question is meant with kindness... I'd be really interested in how people deal with this. Maybe i'm alone in finding this difficult or to even be thinking about something so relatively trivial by comparison but it is such a HUGE part of my life and I always think that surely they aren't expecting me to respond with \"yeah great, went out Fri and Sat, did this, did that\"??? Thank you",
