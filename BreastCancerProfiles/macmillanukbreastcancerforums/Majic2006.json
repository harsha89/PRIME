I am glad I joined this online community, it helps knowing someone understands.  I have got a softie, and I have bought a mastectomy bra, which is good and the softie doesn't come out of it, but it is hell wearing it.  I suppose  I am still too sore yet.  ",

      "Content": "hi all, I am new to the group and I am feeling a bit lost. I had a lumpectomy which was unsuccessful and a mastectomy nearly 3weeks ago with full node clearance. The cancer was found in the first node only. I am goimg to have chemo, radiotherapy and hormone treatment. I am finding it really hard to cope with wearing a bra, it is so painful. I may be pushing myself but I am trying to look as normal as possible when I go out (which is not often as I am so tired). I have my specialist bra measurement  and prosthesis fitting on 25 august but it seems so far away. Any tips on coping would be much appreciated. I am left with one heavy droopy boob, too much information......sorry!  Look forward to getting some tips, thanks.",

      "Content": "Shaz, I am still in the flurry of it all, but I think I understand what you are saying. You are probably worn out emotionally and physically and just need to rest and recuperate, but now you are expected to \"get back to normal\". It will be a new normal, and it will take time to adjust. I am certainly no expert, but I hope it all works out for you. Maybe a sticker with \"still exhausted but doing my best\" would be a fine idea. Any enquiries....just stick it on them! Good luck. ",
