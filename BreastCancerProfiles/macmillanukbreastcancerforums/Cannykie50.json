      "Content": "I am due to have my lumpectomy in July and my surgeon has told me I will get the special bra to wear as well. It is supposed to reduce swelling and should be worn night and day for 3 weeks.  Does everyone get these and do they work? I have to pay for it but will be worth it if it helps. ",

      "Content": "I am now into my 3rd week after a WLE, I have had my stitches out this week and told all looks well. The last 2 weeks have be fine not much pain at all around the incision site but this week I am finding my breast very tender to the touch. I wonder if it\u2019s the bruise coming out now that is making it sore. Is it usual to have a tender painful breast. I go to see my surgeon next week and my results. ",

      "Content": "Thank you Gail, its not hot or red just very tender to touch. I am really suffering with a very itchy rash at the moment and to be honest it is worse then the operation site. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s down to the heat we are suffering at the moment or a reaction from the op. The antihistamines aren\u2019t doing a lot to get rid of it. Having to wear a post op bra day and night doesn\u2019t help either.  Thanks for the good wishes and hugs  carrie xxxxx",
