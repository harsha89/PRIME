      "Content": "Hello Don\u2019t be down, the treatment plan is sound and a holiday is just what you need! Change the things you can! I\u2019ve been to a lovely beach front hotel in Tenerife after op too and we sat on a beach bar deck and listened to jazz at sunset. Soak up the fresh air and relax! You will need me time and support and replenish energy after they operate so stash body lotions and nice magazines, films, choc and a bit of cold white wine as well. Talk only to friends who energize you and avoid anyone who drains you! I\u2019m still here 21 years on. Lots of luck to you xx",

      "Content": "Great you saw the lymphoedema nurse. You should get measured for an arm sleeve - the best ones are made in Germany. I have flesh coloured, cranberry red and a new black one which is cool under black shirts or tops  Once you have lymphoedema it will always be there but you can control it with MLD & compression garments. Keeps smilng for a brave new year!! X",

      "Content": "Go to a specialist Lymph drainage Physio  every week if you can. I have had this for 22 years. It\u2019s infuriating but a chronic problem, you will have to maybe live with it. If so, get compression sleeves fitted and wear them every day if you can. Otherwise the whole arm swells. My surgeon said one in three ladies has this but I have to say I\u2019ve hardly ever met any one else!!  In Germany I went every week twice a week for massage. In the UK you\u2019re lucky if you can find a genuine Physio, so be persistent!! NHS really needs us to pay more... good luck .",
