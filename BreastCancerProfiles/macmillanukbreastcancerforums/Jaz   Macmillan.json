      "Content": "Hi Crystal kitty, I'm glad to hear you're feeling better after the weekend. If you ever need a place to go to within the community to vent, you may want to consider joining the Emotional issues group, as well as The Room. Both are filled with users going through similar experiences to yourself, and are brilliant if you're looking for support. I'd also recommend giving the Macmillan support line a call if you ever feel you need to talk to someone directly. It's available on freephone 0808 808 0000, Mon-Fri, 9am-8pm. Please do give them a ring if you need a listening ear. Take care, Jazmine",

      "Content": "Hello all, On Wednesday the author behind the book of Miss You Already - Morwenna Banks - is coming into the office to record a Q&A session. We're looking to source questions from community members and we want to hear from you! After losing three friends \u2013 Deborah,  Victoria and Bethany \u2013 to breast cancer over a short period of time, Morwenna Banks wrote the story behind the critically-acclaimed film Miss You Already, and dedicated it to these three women. The film tells the emotional story of a female friendship that is tested by illness, and is based on Banks\u2019s highly-praised 2013 radio play, Goodbye. Have you got a question you want to ask? Perhaps you want to know how she supported her friends through their diagnoses? Did writing help her grief process? If you have got something you want to ask just comment in our blog post (where you can also watch the trailer for the film). Best wishes, Jazmine",

I don't think anyone has mentioned it yet, but Macmillan actually runs it's own book reviewing service, and we feature weekly Book Club posts here on the Community. You can find our previous posts here; we featured books exclusively on breast cancer during October (Breast Cancer Awareness Month), so one of those titles might be of interest. Macmillan's entire back catalogue can be found here (a downloadable PDF file, so fingers crossed it works for you!). Best wishes to you and Sara, Jazmine",
