      "Content": "I too had this course of treatment.Commenced letrazole in March 2013 and had lumpectomy in May 2014.I had two tumours and although not big were a distance apart.The treatment both shrunk them and reduced space between them enabling me to have lumpectomy.I had regular appointments during this time.I'm from Fife too so probably same consultant.Good luck.",

      "Content": "Was diagnosed during first mammogram and prescribed Letrazole from March 13 to may 14.Had WLE in May followed by further op two weeks later to ensure clear margins.Went on to have 25 sessions of radiotherapy.During this time I was determined to get on with my life.I was seen on a regular basis and informed of my treatment plan.Was told that reduction of other boob would be discussed.Had to phone for both Dexa scan and review( which was 4 months late).Never seen either of the consultants who had treated me or nurse.The one I did see did a quick examination and said I would be seen next year,as he was ushering me out the door.He didn't even ask how I felt.I mentioned that I had a lot of pain recently and he told me to use ibprofen gel.I feel my positivity decreasing and I'm actually quiet worried now.Has anyone else felt like this?",

      "Content": "Hi Callib,sorry for taking so long to reply,I've been on holiday and only just seen your post.I had two lumps,not too large but there was space between them.Initially told that I would need a mastectomy because of this.It was then explained to me by consultant that I could take Letrazole in the hope of shrinking both lumps and reducing space.Thankfully this worked and as a result I had lumpectomy.The downside was that I was on letrazole for 14 months before operation and it was a waiting game.I was seen on a regular basis during this time.I hope this helps,good luck",
