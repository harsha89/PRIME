I got my double mastectomy 12 days ago and the op went ok till the next day when I had a heamatoma and had to go back in to surgery. I had lost a total of 750 mild blood in that bleed. My drains had to stay in for 9 days and they were still relatively heavy when they came out but I trust my surgeon. Still quite sore and \"weird\" feeling on the side where I had node clearance. Then yesterday I got my test results from my brca test back in December and i do have a fault on the brca 2 gene so the next step is to discuss getting my ovaries out. The doctor has says they won't do it till I'm at least in my early 40's or have finished my family. I really don't want to wait though and anyway, chemo may well have left me infertile as I've had no period in 5 months and then when I start tamoxifen next month it could put me in to menopause anyway x x",
