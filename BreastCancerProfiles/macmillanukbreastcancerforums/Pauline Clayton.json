I will have six weeks of radiation after the first six months...monday to friday. My tumour was 2.3 cms...but hadn't attached to the two lymph nodes which were removed. But it had shed cells being a Stage 3.  Hence the chemo. Enter your message...",

      "Content": "I am also advised Queensland is the best state in Australia for breast cancer treatment. But for people outback and in regional areas travel is difficult. I am on Sunshine Coast and have a brand new hospital just down the road with all the facilities, including pathology, radiology and oncology. Before that it was much travelling to major city Brisbane 1.15 away or regional hospital in hinterland region. I would presume if you are in UK there are oncology centres close. My sisterinlaw in Texas is going through same thing but she has MD Anderson in Houston the best cancer treatment in the world. cheers",

      "Content": "I am also an HER-2 positive breast cancer.. Have just had second chemo session. I found last time that chest pains were bad and have been advised to take pain killers for same. But what gets me over the worst I Dexamethasone which I can only take just prior, during and three days after chemo.  That keeps me on my feet and firing. It is a steroid and cannot be taken after lunch otherwise up all night.  I am pretty new to this, and so far my error has been not taking enough support drugs..i.e. painkillers and anti-nausea potions. I am working but now only when I can. Early days yet.  I am told by others, it does get better and you do get into a routine and can predict the good, bad and ugly days... But I am in bed often at 7pm... cheers from Australia..Sunny Queensland.",
