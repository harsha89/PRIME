      "Content": "Hi, I have just finishedmy last FEC, I lost my hair on day 15 after first chemo it started on the fri and by sunday there wasn't much left.  my friend's husband gave me a number 1 with hair clippers and then my sister biced the rest (she's a midwife, so expert with razor lol), they were all upset. The hair on my legs is just starting to grow back, wouldn't have minded if that never grew back lol. The biggest problem for me has been the cold,I have lived in beanie hats, even sleeping in them. I have a wig  but find it very itchy and my head swells as the day goes on. The only hair that I have left is my eyebrows. My eyelashes went last week. I have used false eyelashes for special occasions. You are not moaning, I thought  I would be ok with the hair loss. I had my head shaved for cancer research in 2006. I  have hated it, I think its the control etc and I loved my hair, which is very vain I know. I have tried to make the most of make up, chunky jewelry, scarves etc I know that I am very lucky and this chemo is helping to save my life. Keep strong xxx ",

      "Content": "Hi, I finished my FEC on the 20th April my eyelashes and eyebrows came back quite soon, my hair has been growing for the past 4 weeks. I am feeling almost back to my old self at last. I can recommend the Look Good Feel Better workshops they are a real boost to your self esteem. I am back at work, just waiting for my DIEP reconstruction, so there is light at the end of the tunnel. Keep strong and positive.  Love and luck to everyone going on this journey   xx",

      "Content": "Hi donnaree, You have every right tobe upset. I was very cross and upset when my hair started to fall out on the 3rd week of my first cycle, even though i had been bald in 2006 ( I had my head shaved for cancer research). I know it's very vain but I loved my hair and had just got it in the style that I liked. All my family and friends said well you will be ok because you have been bald before!!! I had mine cut short before it started to fall out and then had it shaved when it started to fall out. I have a wig ,but find it itches. I have hats and scarves. I would walk around bald but find it so cold on the top of my head. I too have frightened the window cleaner and postman lol. I have lost my eyelashes and most of my eyebrows but heyho this stuff is helping to save my life. My head and lady garden hair are just starting to make a reappearance I am just on my 15th day of my 6 th chemo cycle. Good luck with your head shave honey  Marie xxxx",

      "Content": "Hi I had my last chemo April 2011, (FEC) my nails have lefted on some of my fingers with lots of ridges, I try to keep them pretty short , file the flappy bits off, use cuticle oil, handcream for moisture and nail varnish (just to stop my nails catching on everything). I try to eat healthy food and drink lots of water. My big toe nails are lifting and I will lose them eventually. I have spoken and been to a chiropodist, and my local beauty therapist. They both said it was the chemo. My hair is growing back really well and looking very healthy. I hope this helps everyone going through this journey, keep strong, keep fighting xx  ",
