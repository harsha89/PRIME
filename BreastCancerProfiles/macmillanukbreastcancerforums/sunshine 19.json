Alot of the time i eat i feel as though i'm going to be physically sick and my stomach churns. I'm lucking as have been caught early, yes i have to have a mastectomy and am having an immediate reconstruction and sentel lymph nodes biopsy. All being well no radiotheraphy needed.   I'm also lucky as have alot of people praying for me. My husband is a fabulous support and is taking time of work from i go in until needed It's all just very overwhelming and scary as you know.  Sorry for the long rant. Gentle Hugs and a Happy Easter to you and your family  sunshine-19",

      "Content": "Hi Henty I know what you mean as even though my operations not until the 9th May at times i feel as though i can't breathe and have to keep taking deep breaths. Your are probably having panic attacks which can happen its a big thing that is happening your body and you are fearing the unknown. Your surgeon i'm sure has lost count quite some time ago how many times they have preformed these operations . They are highly skilled and will take the horrible disease away then whatever else your getting done. The next thing you will know you will wake up in the recovery ward more than likely thirsty and hungry Just to put you at ease if i can God rest my mum she had a mastectomy a few months before her 85th birthday and she sailed through it. My mum was afraid before but when she came round from Surgery she thought it hadn't  been done yet. My mum never looked back and couldn't believe how easy she got over as she didn't do well with pain.  My mum died last June but, it was due to dementia.  I hope i can be as brave as she was as she was a real Inspiration to others and me. Good night Henty Gentle Hugs being sent to you. Love A x",

A massive thing has happened to you and it will take time for your energy alone to build back up.  Can understand when you say it feels like you were down a big rabbit hole.  Just take things slowly and give yourself to heal all the different ways. The appointments i have had so far the nurses, consultants and two surgeon have all been fantastic. Infact they are trying to close our breast cancer unit and i went to a meeting in my town and she was at it . She was very discreet and when i spoke with her afterwards in private she was great.  I have to go and see her before my op so im hoping she will ring on Monday.  I may have to wait longer to drive as i already have a problem with my right arm i hoping not though. You look after yourself and i will keep in touch. Love and gentle hugs Angela x",

Self care is very important as if you give to everybody else there's nothing left for you, then you can fall ill.  At this time those that you gave to should be helping you. Sorry to hear about you losing your purse etc, I will pray all turns up  You are very strong to have travelled so far on your own. You say your not brave I believe you are and this has made you even stronger..  You had a blip yesterday but that could have happened you any time in life your being hard on yourself. Be proud of yourself  and what you have managed to come through. I'm glad your operation and reconstruction have been such a success and that you are happy with the outcome I was told originally I would only need a lumpectomy and a few lymph nodes removed for biopsy but since core needle was done said from results that it's larger spread than first thought. For this reason I now need a mastectomy and sentnel lymph nodes biopsy.  So that was a massive shock as wasn't really prepared for that outcome. Have come to terms with it now my date for operation and reconstruction on 9th May and how to go and see my surgeon week or so for final measurements etc. Roll on 9th  May hopefully no other treatment she doesn't expect there to be any. As you say just nibble at stuff whatever takes my fancy and drink tea or fluids. My husband and I were away the Monday after diagnosed as it was a Christmas present from him. We went away for 4 days to Santa Pins will had a lovely relaxing time. It just came at the right time :) . Thank you for your lovely message it has been of great help to me.  You have a lovely Easter and I hope you are either spoiled or you spoil yourself.

I'm sure you'll be glad to get all your treatment over you.  Then start to recover and get to back to some type of normality. Your friend said she would have them both whipped off but, no disrespect to her you don't know until you have it.  Its a big thing either getting a lumpectomy or a mastectomy  thats why it's such abig shock when you hear it. I will be fine just wish it was over :) .   Thank you for everything. Let me know how your results go and i  will keep in touch and let you know how i get on. Gentle Hugs and best wishes.

On the 20th March I went for a mammogram in our mobile unit, needless to say I have had these before and they have came back normal. So I was shocked on Monday 25th  I was asked  to go to our nearest Macmillan unit for further investigations.  The doctor told me I had calification in my right breast so wanted me to have more test to see if benign or not. I had another mammogram, ct scan and 2 core  biopsies.   I would like to know after people have had these biopsies is it natural to still feel unwell and fatigued by end of 3rd day ?  Also what experiences people have had and the outcome?    I get my results on Thursday which feels like ages away but is only 4 days now. I'm very anxious and would just like to talk to others in a similar situation. Thank you in advance",

I love both my mum and dad but, mum  and me shared great memories . Was very close to my family. She was just my wee diamond with a wicked sense of humour :) . When i got my ct scan the woman said there was no lumps in my breast.  What worried me was she also did under arm and said nothing about the lymph nodes.  Probably worrying unnecessarily . I will just pray alls ok. That was lovely that your boys spoiled you. I  got lovely flowers, nicnaks and clothes. Love Angela x",
