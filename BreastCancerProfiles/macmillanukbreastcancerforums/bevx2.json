    "Content": "I too have gained weight...in fact managed to put on a whole stone during my chemo. (How you can put weight on when you can't eat one week in three is amazing!) The oncologist said it was the steroids and it would \"even out\" in the next 6 months but I've taken the bull by the horns and just emptied my wardrobe and bought lots of great new clothes. Every cloud has a silver lining...although I must admit I cried my eyes out as I threw out my lovely size 8s and started hanging up size 12s! I too have always been slight,like you, and have found the weight gain harder than the loss of my right breast and all my lovely hair....I think it's 'cus your size defines you as a person and I can't put a wig or a \"falsee\" on my new \"Buddah belly\". Don't be too hard on yourself you're allowed to get upset sometimes and it's often the small things that get you down. Concentrate on getting better and then perhaps we can go on a diet together when the worst is over! Bev",
