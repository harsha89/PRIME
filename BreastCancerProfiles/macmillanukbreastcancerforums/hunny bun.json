    "Content": "Hi I had a DVT prior to finding out I had cancer and was put on warfarin for 6 month, I found out about the cancer in january and came of the warfarin in febuary. Last saturday I started to get a tightening in my left leg so went to the docs on wednesday because it wasnt getting any better, they sent me straight to A&E, I had an ultra sound scan but they said they couldnt find anything, and told me that having chemo can hide other thing such as DVTS, so I have to go back next thursday for another scan to see if anything has changed. I know its scary having a DVT on top of everuthing else thats going on in your life but they do keep a close eye on youand if you have any concerns dont hesitate to get intouch with someone, I even phoned the warfarin clinic when I got stung by a wasp because there are lotions and potions you carnt use. Hope it all goes well for you xx Â ",
