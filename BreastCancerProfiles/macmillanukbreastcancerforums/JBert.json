      "Content": "cookie65 Hope you are doing okay..............  I had 6 fec chemos and lost my hair the day after fec chemo 2.  It had been coming out in the shower and when I brushed it but it was more or less gone the day after my 2nd chemo. Please don't think you are moaning as I found loosing my hair very upsetting as I felt like a freak but knew that I could not help it.  I had a wonderful wig - hated calling it that so named her Winnie....... and had lovely chiffon scarves with tails that you could hang down the side which made you feel more femine.  I finished my chemo last September and had a full head of hair by February........... had my first trim yesterday and it felt great.  My hair had come back in thick just as it was before except for the feckin curls....... I look like Shirley Temple!!!!! You hang in there don't think there could have been anyone more obsessed with their hair than me but it shows that the chemo is working............ Keep in touch to let me know how you are getting on Warmest wishes   JBert",

      "Content": "Hi Sally I can totally understand where you are coming from with the painful head and scalp.  This happened to me last year after my first fec treatment.  By the time my hair fell out day after my 2nd chemo the pain was much better.  I have no tips to be honest but did take co-codomil tablets which seemed to help.  It was only a short while after the first fec that I started to experience the pain in the scalp.   I now have my full head of hair back as I finished my chemo in September of last year and still going through Herceptin which I will continue with until Christmas.  On a break with it at the moment as the Herceptin seems to be affecting my heart - according to the last heart scan.  Once you loose your hair - although it will be traumatic there will be a sense of relief as I felt that there was nothing worse that brushing your hair and it coming out in clumps.  Never thought that would happen to me but it did.  I found loosing my hair quite difficult to be honest but now I have lovely soft baby hair - even though it is feckin curly but oh so thick which is great. You take care and let me know how you get on after your next treatment Take care and warmest wishes JBert",

      "Content": "Hello Carold   Many thanks for replying but so sorry to hear that you have secondary cancer and you are continuing with the treatment.  I honestly don't know how I would cope with Secondary Cancer.  Having cancer in the first place was a blow to me and when I was told that it had not spread to lymph nodes etc that was a good news.    If you dont mind me asking how many chemos did you have...... You take care of yourself and keep in touch Warmest Wishes Judith",

      "Content": "Hi folks I am due my 2nd FEC chemo on Wednesday of this week given that my bloods are okay.  I am to receive 6 cycles of chemo every 3 weeks which takes me to the 15th September as being the last one if everything goes according to plan.  However, after that I have to still attend the Macmillan Suite every 3 weeks for a year to receive the Herceptin Drug.  Anybody at present going through the Herceptin.  If you are was just wondering how long it took the drug to be administered and how they felt they were coping with any side effects if any.........   I know that I am trying to focus on my chemo just now but would be interested to hear from anybody who is currently or has been given Herceptin.  1 year on this seems like ages for me........ Look forward to hearing from someone.   Many thanks   JBert",
