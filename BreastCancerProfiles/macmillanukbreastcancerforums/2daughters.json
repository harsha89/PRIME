      "Content": "Hi all. Thankyou all for your kind words and  support from my sister :0) right now I am feeling to be the BIGGEST wuss ever :0/  I had to have another op due to my lumpectomy not having enough margin removed as the lump was 31mm rather than 8mm that showed on the mammogram scans. The biopsy told us that this nasty thing is a stage 3 :0( I was originally told to expect radio and hormone tablets before my 1st op and told before my 2nd op it will be chemo radio and the tablets?? I suffer with anxiety really badly so you can imagine the waiting game of results and op dates and more results has been a nightmare :0( I lost my appetite and just under 2stone in 7weeks :0/  ive given up smoking too 8weeks so feel my nerves are shot to bits :0/ I am eating better now. all I want to do is sleep is this normal?? I been told fatigue??i feel so weak and heavy and what sleep I manage ends in nightmares:0( ive tried listening to relaxing music when I fall asleep and breathing exercises. I visit my surgeon again tomorrow for last weeks 2nd op results which I really am truely dreading as it seems my news just gets worse :0(   I think it's all the fear of not knowing and all the research ive done through Google rather than this wonderful site that has scared me to hell :0(  stories of not being able to hold babies (my eldest daughter expecting in April) and not being able to  be close to adults and flushing the toilet twice with the seat lid down all during chemo :0/ please tell me I'm sooooooo wrong. I don't want to be ill im not an ill person. I run round after my husband normally who has been a rock for me during this hard part of my journey so far bless him and my 12year old daughter who we did visit/ride her pony on a daily routine but had to give up with for now(she's now on full livery) because I just don't have the energy :0/ sorry if I baffled on but feel so alone with my symptoms and worries :0/  I was staying positive but my positivity keeps being knocked :0/  sorry guys for the doom and gloom :0( please advise me on how to stay positive  in the mean time all stay strong and keep smiling :0)  your doing well :0)  xxx",

      "Content": "Thankyou ladies. I spoke to my oncologist and she said more than likely nerve endings and I also pointed out to her I have a small lump by where the original lump was and she said to keep an eye on it it and it feels she's pretty certain like a clip the surgeon has left in there?!!! Has anybody heard of this?? Soooo sorry. Thanks for your support ;0) x",
