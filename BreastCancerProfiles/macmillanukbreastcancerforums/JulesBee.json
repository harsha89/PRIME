      "Content": "My experience was very similar to Ann.  My tumour was 13mm with no spread to nodes but it turned out to be HER2 positive.  I was given the choice of radiotherapy and tamoxifen only or to add chemotherapy followed by herceptin for a year.  This would bring my chances of recurrence back to if it wasn't HER2 pos but this was a difference of approx 5%.  As I am 42 and with two young sons I took the decision to go for the chemo as I would hate for it to come back without my doing everything possible to stop it. Ann - I have just finished my chemo and like you had moments of wondering if I had done the right thing as I felt I was letting my kids down by lying in bed being completely useless.  I got very down at times but the boys adapted amazingly to my disappearances.  You will get through this.

      "Content": "Hi Jules I've been taking tamoxifen for about 6 weeks now and have only a few side effects. Like Chris I have to pee during the night and didn't before - didn't realise this might be a side effect till I read your post Chris! I am having hot flushes mainly at night (I take my tablet at night) but not too many. I have put on a bit of weight but not sure if its due to tamoxifen cos I lost a lot during chemo so would naturally be putting it back on now.  I do think I have a bit of water retention at times. I am tired but think this is more to do with the after effects of the RT and I started herceptin last week too. So on the whole not as bad as i feared. Jules xx",

I now have the start of very bushy eyebrows!  It looks really odd after having a few hairs on each brow for months.  Will have to start plucking soon!  Eyelashes are also on the way back but quite short still.  I have been using baby shampoo on my head and then massaging it with almond oil - am also quite addicted to this!!  I can definitely see new growth!

You will get through this.  Just give yourself time to readjust and to allow your body to heal in its own time.  Don't worry about sitting around in your pjs - I still do that now with very little excuse! Good luck for Tuesday - the waiting for results is often the worst part. Take care Jules xx",

The waiting seems to be the worst part. After you know what (if any) treatments you will need after surgery then it gives you something to focus on.   Try not to fear the treatments too much.  I am a complete wimp and I have amazed myself at the strength I have found to get through chemotherapy.   You do have good days as well as challenging ones. Good luck with the surgery. Jules x",
