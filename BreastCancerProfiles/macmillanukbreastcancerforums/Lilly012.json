      "Content": "Thank you for reply, group seems very supportive already.  Ive had several biopsies in the past which have all been the fibroademonas. I had a huge one removed, simply due to size. He never said which was why I\u2019m worried. In the past, luckily seen same doc lots, he always seemed positive and would say to try not to worry, was sure was fibroademona etc. This time he said nothing. Before ultrasound he said, if biopsy required I\u2019d have to go back for it as very very busy, then when found he changed his mind very quickly. First tried to drain fluid with needle but was nothing to drain. He just had no positivity in him at all this time.  How are you doing after your radiotherapy? ",

      "Content": "Thanks for replying. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re having to go through all of this. I think your choice of how you told your kids was a good one. I think I would maybe have done the same. It\u2019s my daughters birthday on Friday coming. I kind of don\u2019t want to know until after her birthday as if it\u2019s bad news I\u2019m worried I\u2019ll wallow in self pity. As selfish as that sounds.  Stay strong and thanks again x",

      "Content": "So I had my biopsy done on Tuesday past. It\u2019s not the first one I\u2019ve had, but this is different and my symptoms are different. I\u2019d like to hear about what took you to the breast clinic? My current visit was due to pain in my breast, crusty sort of nipple, shoulder and upper back pain, then on ultrasound a lump was found that I hadn\u2019t felt. I\u2019m terrified, but I guess I just have to wait. ",

I\u2019m terrified every time my phone rings.  I see your point about weird luck. I\u2019m glad you found the first one. How long have you been diagnosed and how do you and family cope. I\u2019m 37, husband, son who\u2019s 17 and daughter almost 7.  Lilly",
