      "Content": "Hi Hides I also am suffering from joint pain and have been taking Tamoxifen since August. My oncologist said this is a side effect of Tamoxifen. It\u2019s my hands, fingers and lower back that are affected the worst so saw my GP and he gave me Naproxen which definitely helps. Still aware of pain and stiffness but not as bad as it was!  Recently had discomfort/pain in armpit, shoulder and side of affected boob....BCN says this is almost certainly side effects from radiotherapy which I finished end of Sept.  I guess our bodies can\u2019t go through all this treatment without some side effects. Do hope you get something for your joints soon and good luck with your radiotherapy!  Lx",

      "Content": "Hi! I\u2019ve been taking tamoxifen since beginning of August and also get hot flashes/night sweats. I also take Venlafaxine so I guess hot flushes not as bad as they would be if I didn\u2019t! My joints and muscles were getting really sore and stiff especially my hands, fingers and lower back. Saw my GP last week and he prescribed Naproxen which has worked wonders. My hands are so much better now.  Hope you get something to help soon. Lx",
