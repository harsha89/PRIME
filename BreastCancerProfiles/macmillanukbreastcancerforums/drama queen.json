      "Content": "thank you for taking the time out to reply its great to know there are people who have had similar experiences!! I looked at the link you sent and it may have given me some possible reasons as to dizziness that i wasn't aware of before. When i was operated on I had a particularly nasty reaction to morphine and any pain relieving opinum based drugs. So had to manage pain on ibuprfen and paracetamol 48 hrs after bi-lateral, lympnodes taken and reconstruction using tummy. I had some weird pains and was clenching hands, and doing punching actions, body was almost having spasms. The junior doctor that i felt i had little faith in told me this was neurological pain and that not much is known about it. It was extremely scary as noone had seen anything like it!! I am now wondering if my dizziness is connected as it has been there since surgery but has gone worse lately or that the tamoxifen is contributing! Will let you know what happens seeing oncologist in 2 weeks. I have also had blood in stools so now am having worry of that to!! Crumbs what next ladies, back to doctors hopefully nothing serious! I don't like going to the doctors and now I feel like a regular customer!! Take care ladies thanks for comments Love Drama Queen xxxxxx",

      "Content": "I haven't been on this site much but thought someone may be similar to me? I was diagonised with invasive lobular cancer and had bi-lateral masectomy with reconstruction using tummy. Had some radiotherapy and now on the tamoxifen for the 5 years!! I had op end of march and seem to physically recover very well initially well didn't have choice got a 2 young kids so wanted to be able to do everything would normally do! I tried to go back to work a few wks ago but found it too exhausting and that i keep getting vertigo sensation. This whirling feeling has been there since op just thought it was my body telling me to sit down when i'm trying too hard now i'm not sure!! I have been docs had blood tests only one up was my kidney one. I have done exercises incase its middle ear but don't feel the prob is ear related but could be wrong!! I seem to be very tired not the same energy as had before the cancer, is it the tamoifen or purely the aftermath of alot of surgery? Has anyone else had this drained feeling and spinning sensation? My body still aches and have weird pains at sites of surgery how long does the aching last anyone am cheesed off with feeling like 99 year old!! Anyone similar??? Oh well have a drink later its wkend!!!! Love drama queen xxx",
