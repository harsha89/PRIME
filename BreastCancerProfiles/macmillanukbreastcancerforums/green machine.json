I had t/m 15 today and have 10 more to go and the skin has just started to cook :-(. The nurse has sent me home with a bag full of cooling gel and dressings that I have to apply now and wear all day and night - they have cooled the area today thank goodness. Yes I've been told the 'cooking' can continue for a while after treatment stops - it can''t go on forever - we WILL get our life back soon! Hope it goes well when you go into work - I have been doing a few hours over the last few weeks but I am so tired now I am reducing them again where I can I am aiming for next week at home at least. Hope the rest of the treatment goes wel, take care of yourself Barbara x",

      "Content": "Hi Joan I am sorry you have had a few problems - I hope you are felling better now and your skin has recovered. I had the 'vaseline' dressing for the last two weeks of my treatment and for a wekk after as my skin was so sore - but luckily it has not blistered I think they treated it just in time. I know what you mean about all the dressings - you feel so self concious and tender especially as the dressings pull the skin off - it was painful. I did not go to work either as I felt the same plus I could not get anything decent on to wear! It is 9 days since my last treatment and I am now just applying the gel and dressings at night - they run out at the weekend which will be fine as it is much better now - just a bit tender . My skin is peeling alot - at least that means it does not stay so dark and pigmented.. Today I applied deodrant for the first time because nobody has told me any different! I have an appointment next week so maybe they will tell me more then. I am still a bit tender and take parcetemol everyday for the stabbing pains but at last my tirdeness seems to be lifting - 5 weeks of treatment was a long haul! I've not heard about not using desodrant ever again though .......... Keep smiling we are nearly there? Best wishes Barbara x",

I was like you-  first 3 weeks were fine - then it hit me almost overnight - totally washed out, my hair and skin were totally out of sorts. Nurses told me to make sure I drank loads of water (which I was doing) and make sure I had protein at every meal - I seemed to eat constantly.This lasted about a week after treatment stopped then since then I just feel I bit better every day. Energy levels are not back completly yet but ist getting better. Do you have many more treatments to go Barbara x It is obvious everyone reacts differently - if you feel that bad you must talk to the staff and see the nurse. I had a really bad cold one week yet they told me to go for the treatment regardless of how I felt.",

Glad to hear you are not too sore - yes I discarded the bra about 2 weeks ago too- it definately helps not to wear one. I now have to see the nurse after every treatment as my skin is red. sore and peeling - so lots of gel and dressings - I am wrapped up very well every day. I also have been given gel dressings which go in the fridge - I put these on as my skin gets hot and sore later in the day - its does help. It would seem that the gel and dressings are only produced when the skin starts misbehaving as they dont want the skin to break .  I just used the aqueous cream at home before my skin reacted.  I suppose eveyone's skin is different - I get prickly heat so I did wonder how my skin would cope..... now I know.

      "Content": "Gosh I feel for you both as I remember the weeks of making the decisions prior to the operation. There are so many different experiences its is difficult - remember what I tell you now is just mine. To cut a long story short after diagnosis I was recommended a DEIP flap - its like a TRAM but instead of taking the muscle it  takes the fat from the abdomen for the reconstruction - the hospital I am at do not offer the TRAM very often and prefer the DEIP as they say there is less chance of Hernia in the future. I was amazed as I did not realise that this could be done. I was not recommended the second option (from the back) as I have full size breasts and was told this is only really for smaller ladies plus I would require an implant. I did not like the idea of an implant if I am honest - that is just me as - I have read comments on here from ladies who have had an implant and are doing well with it. I was told I would not require Chemo or Radio unless it was found in my lymph nodes and they doubted this would be the case. After the op I was told the cells were in the ducts but more widespread and near the surface of the skin but not in the lymph nodes. Because the cells were near the surface and high grade I was strongly recommended to have radiotherapy - I am about to complete 5 weeks of this. I questioned the effect R/T would have on my reconstruction and was told that it may affect the texture and size a little but not too much - this I will not know for a while until all the redness and swelling has gone from the R/T treatment. My cancer was not found as a lump - there were no symptons - it was found on Xray. It is called DCIS which is found in the milk ducts - so it is not classed as invasive type when caught early. I had extensive biopsies which indicated there was no spread out of the ducts so they said it was very doubful I would need chemo.You're situtation sounds different as chemo is being dicussed as a possible - I was told I would not have been able to have the reconctruction at the same time if I would have required chemo. Again I have spoken to some ladies and read comments on here that confirm that some had to wait for the reconstruction as they required cheme and R/T. Its not an easy time as there is so much to take in - have you looked at the information on this site regarding the procedures - plus I am sure you will soon find you have more mssages with more advice which will help you. Maybe you need to go back to your consultant now and discuss this again - it does take a while to sink in and I found the 2nd and 3rd time I was more informed and we had a better discussion. I think hospitals differ as well in what they offer - thats the impression I get anyway Thinking of you Barbara x",

Aren't we lucky to have all these great people helping us on this website. I had a Mastectomy in July this year after calcification found that was 8cm spread and high grade cells. I was told the chance of it spreading was high and a lumpectomy was out of the question. I was as scared as you and it took me 3 weeks to agree to the op. I also agreed to a reconstruction at the same time so my recovery has been longer due to the op on my tummy. I have spoken to a few ladies who faced the same as me - some having reconstruction a year later and no one was anything but scared. But the treatment we have in this country for this is amazing (this has already been said to you) and although everyone of us is individual and have different experiences- there are so many of us who have survived the op and recovery period. I was shaking the morning before my op - buut the staff are used to it and cope brillantly. I met someone who had the lump removed and then had to go back for another op soon after as they found the margin for the calcification was not clear so she ended up with the Mastecomy after all. I am half way through radio therapy (which |i did not think I would need) but luckily don't need chemo as my lymph nodes were clear. Good luck and think positive Barbara x",

I was so pleased to be out I soon got over being very self conscious, I think dressing so you feel comfortable and nice helps but also accept you need a little time to get used to everything. My biggest test was going to see my son play cricket at our local club (where my hubby is a coach too), I live their in the summer so lots of people knew about me - I was nervous. However I was so overwhelmed with their kindness and reaction when I got there - they cheered! They were just so pleased to see me - even some of the senior team members came and hugged me - what had I got to worry about? I soon learnt how many other ladies there had suffered in a similar way too. No one ever said it would be a walk over but I've had such fantastic care in hospital, from my breast nurses, from people around me and this site its helped me through. Radio Therapy is tiring now I am into my 4th week but I am over half way through now. Look at all the help you have on this forum - you are going to be alright! Best wishes Barbara x          ",

We all deal with this in our own way - and I know I was terrified leading up my operation and I can't put into words how I felt the morning of my operation. I look back now and my op in July has faded into the background as recovery and radio therapy has been my focus. I had my time when I told my husband I could not do it - but then I looked at my kids and knew I had to - if only for them. People tell me I am brave - and my answer is always that I don't quite know where the strength comes from, it suddenly it kicks in and  takes over helping you deal with each stage or hurdle so I guess it kicks in at different times for all of us.

I was in hospital for 10 days (this is more than normal as I had a mild skin infection in a few sutures but nothing serious). I was out of bed in 48 hours - only to go to the loo and sit in a chair (not for very long) but I managed it. Thank goodness for painkillers - they do get you through the first few weeks. My tummy was tender  to say the least and my reconstructed breast swollen for longer than they said it would be - but it was not a concern to them. Its a big op so I was warned I would be exhausted after and I was - eating was such a major effort! The first week is very tiring especially as you are checked so often - but all the nursing staff were fantastic and helped me through. the great thing is you look down and still have a breast - its amazing really. The drains were a bit strange but I just accepted they had a job to do for while and I had no choice. I was really scared when I went in for the op - but I got through! Having this method does mean a longer recovery time and your tummy will restrict you for a while. I had to take things slowly and soon learnt this really is an investment of time. August was spent at home sleeping  - night and day - propped up most of the time too! September was better I could stand up straighter and the tenderness was reducing really well. The tummy takes longer than the breast - even now I still have to be careful I dont over do it. I have healed well and have just about got used to my abdominal scar - its almost part of me now and I also have a lovely flat tummy! I have had to have Radio Therapy in the end (it was not orginally planned) this I am just coming to the end - without this I would have been back at work sooner. I don't want to paint too rosy a picture - its been a hard few months - but I came through and I have spoken to others who have too. I also dont have to go back for another major op - it seemed to make sense to me. My reconstruction has remained a little larger than my breast was originally so when I go for nipple reconstruction next year the plastic surgeon is going to reduce it with Lipo suction so I will be balanced, this will just be day surgery. I suppose the hardest part is that you just dont realise how long it will take for everything to settle ( well I certainly didnt't). I could only wear jeans/waistbands this week because I could not stand them pressing into my tummy - even my loose ones. So I have lived in leggins, jogging bottoms, long t shirts and jumpers - thank goodness they are in the shops! You can't wear a bra for a while after and then it has to be without underwires but there are quite a few sites on the net you can purchase from. If you have any questions I will try my best to answer them for you and I am sure there will lots more ladies sending you messages on here soon. Take care Barbara x",
