      "Content": "Hello again Lee, I can\u2019t count on the healing time of my first mastectomy, as I had the misfortune of an internal stitch causing an infection.  I had my second mastectomy on Wed 14 March.  Was home on Fri 16th.  I have three drains, which, knowing the way, opt to empty, measure the fluid and logging down myself. Thus, freeing up a home visitor and allowing them to attend the more needy.  My waste count is rapidly decreasing each day - so I\u2019m hoping that at tomorrow\u2019s clinic my drains may be removed.   As I opted for Becker Implants, when the area has settled, saline fill via a port is my way.  To have your mastectomy, you may still be required to have radiotherapy.  To solely have radiotherapy, is not (FOR ME) belt \u2018n\u2019 braces.  It\u2019s a choice only you can make with your consultant BUT it is YOUR choice.  I thank you for your good wishes. This time around, it\u2019s a breeze. I am getting grief via the coiled pipes. I am avidly looking for any sign of red - as an alert for wrong going.  So far, so good.  Back to you...",

Statistics can be a wonderful thing - on paper. I wanted to have done my utmost, for sound mind   Judgment, will tell at a later date. Know your body. Know your choices. Good luck. ",
