This will be followed by 6 sessions of chemo, 3 weeks of radio and medication for 5years. I too was scared and wary about the spread but it does seem to be quite common. It's a scary journey and we are only at the begining.",

I feel my identity is being taken away and I have no control, my hair is me and Iam not going to be me any more it's a horrible feeling. The thing is we do have to deal with this and I have a wig fitting tomorrow so Iam going to make sure I get a wig which Iam really comfortable with because its going to be my safety net for a while until I get some confidence back.

The unknown is the scary thing I think, I've read all the useful info on this site so far and drawn from people's experiences. The thing is to go into it with an open mind because everybody is different. My problem is I haven't felt ill so really couldn't take it in that I had cancer but once the chemo starts its ok this is it. Try and keep positive we'll get through with the help of all the lovely ladies on here xx",
