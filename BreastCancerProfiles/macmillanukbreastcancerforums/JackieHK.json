      "Content": "I started losing some hair at day 14. By day 16 I couldn't put a comb through my very thick, but now in a pixie cut, hair. So I shaved it to 3mm. The tenderness stopped me from sleeping properly, but it was much less after I shaved. I read that the pain is caused by the hair follicles dying. Anyway, 3mm was so spikey that kept sticking into my scalp, so yesterday it all went, and it's much easier now. I wanted to shave it before I had lots on my pillow or in the shower, but I'm glad it's all gone now. Good luck. xxx",

My legs feel like lead, and the shortness of breath feels like when I used to suffer from asthma. Has anyone else had this SE from Docetaxol and Cyclofosfomide? Many thanks.",

      "Content": "Thank you all for your help. As I live in Spain, I don't have a BCN, nor BC clinic, so I took myself to A n E, and was admitted yesterday morning. I've had extensive tests including a CT scan and Ecocardiogram, and am pleased to say that all major organs are fine, as are the red blood cells. The consensus is that I have had a build up of fluid in the lungs cased by the Docetaxel, and over dosage of GCSF meds. Also, my steroids are only given intravenously before the chemo meds. Next cycle will be tailored better on all counts. I am so grateful that you took the time to answer. I may not have gone to A and E otherwise. Greetings from Spain. xxxx",

      "Content": "banjoman Hi there, (sorry, I don't know your name!) Thank you so much for contacting us, we really appreciate it. I'm led to believe a core biopsy is the taking of samples of flesh from deeper in the breast tissue for examination as opposed to liquid as in a needle aspiration and we've heard it can be very uncomfortable if extreme care isn't taken.  Although we've read that cancer is statistically unlikely in the greater picture of breast cancer as a whole, given my wife's age and the way her GP reacted and responded to the indentation and her comment \" let's hope you've caught it early\" we're not counting any chickens! We've also yet to hear of anyone that presents with an indentation having a benign tumour but we remain hopeful and after Monday's appointment things will be a little clearer.  How are you getting on with your cancer ? We hope that it's getting it's just deserts and you're bearing up as well as possible. We wish you all the very best and hope for a positive outcome for you. All the best for now. Banjoman  Hi Banjoman, Firstly let me say that anyone who has gone through this process will tell you that the waiting is always the worst. Once you have a diagnosis, if it turns out to be breast cancer, at least you know what you are dealing with, and most people have a totally different mindset. As far as the core biopsy is concerned, please don't worry. I had one and felt no pain whatsoever. I was given a local anaesthetic and the whole area was numbed. I wish yo the best for the upcoming tests.",
