    "Content": "Hi Everyone, thought I'd like to join in, I'm having chemo 2 tomorrow morning and have been wondering whether to continue with the cap as have just started experiencing thinning today. I thought this might mean the lot would be coming out soon but after reading your comments I think I will carry on. Its not so bad after the first 5 minutes, i t just means two hours instead of  one. The nurses are pretty confident  about its success. Kind regards    ",
