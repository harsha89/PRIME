    "Content": "8 weeks after my mastectomy, 28mm tumour removed, 3 postive lypmh nodes, HER 2 negative, estrogen receptor positive, had the oncotype dx test ( they gave me a cut off of 11) as low and to have chemo if above, unsure as yet to why mine has been put lower than the usual low score of 18. Has anyone else been in same situation had chemo even though the score is low, mine came back at just 13? Got consultation on Wednesday with the oncologist.Â ",
