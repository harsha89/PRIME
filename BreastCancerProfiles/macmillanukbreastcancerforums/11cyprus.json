      "Content": "puzzler pleased to hear you eventually got help ....sometimes we need to be very proactive on our own account ......it took me 7 weeks to get 4 blood clots diagnosed !!!  I hope you can find a professional to trust ....best wishes Vioplex-T is an antibiotic spray powder. You can buy it over the counter in Cyprus but not sure in uk. I ask on holiday in Cyprus at the minute if anyone needs some. Unless your doctor will prescribe, it is excellent and I use it on any wounds, especially good when my nails dropped off. Yvonne",

      "Content": "Hi I do not post very often, but read your discussions on a daily basis. Such a brilliant siteand always very positive.  My question is I am having Herceptin after chemo and rads and am on my 7th Herceptin. The past 6 weeks I have had a buzzing in my head, have had my ears checked no problems there.  It is starting to worry me now as I am thinking the worst that maybe the cancer has spread to my head. Could this be a side effect from Herceptin, or anxiety or stress. I have been so positive since my prognosis but this is really getting me down. Any help would be very useful. Yvonne",

      "Content": "Hi nic, I live in Southampton and have recently joined this site. I was supposed to start herceptin but after having a heart scan found my heart only performing 45% instead of 65% . Considering I am 60 next week, never been ill in my life until April when I developed Bells Palsy, followed by double vision where I ended up going to casualty and being admitted to a ward. After two weeks of scans and blood tests they found a lump in my breast of 19mm. It was stage 3 cancer, so had my left breast removed. I have had 3 doses of Fec and am now just had my lst dose of docetaxel. Two more to follow. I have been referred to cardiologist and put on ramipril for my heart. As herceptin has an effect on the heart this is why I cannot have it at present. Thought this new drug of yours could be an answer. Thank you for reply. Yvonne",
