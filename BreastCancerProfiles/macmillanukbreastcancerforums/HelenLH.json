    "Content": "We are still in shock & reeling from the news, as my mum was diagnosed with breast cancer last Thurs(15th Nov) & was admitted into hospital today(21st Nov), for an op to hopefully remove all of the lump/cancer? Apparently the op went as planned, so I'm really hoping that they've managed to remove all of the lump/cancer, but we wont know for sure, so I guess time will tell? I can not imagine what my mum is going through, as I'm still finding it hard to accept/deal with myself. She's my mum, my rock & she absolutely means the world to me & I would do anything for her. I wish I had a magic wand so that I could make or take the cancer away. I would even swap places with her if I could, as she has a heart of gold & will do anything & everything she can to help anyone she knows, if she can. So finger's crossed that she will be ok & even though she will be on radiotherapy or even chemotherapy for the rest of her life, I hope that she can make a good recovery, the best that she can.",
