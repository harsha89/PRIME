    "Content": "Hi everyone, I've just joined in the hope of finding out more about my newly diagnosed breast lymphoedema. I had a WLE and sentinel node removal on December 10th. At my first check up on Dec 23rd, I was virtually healed and in no pain. The next day, tenderness in the breast which by the day after was pain. Over the Christmas period, whilst everyone was on hols, my breast became swollen and incredibly painful (to the point I couldn't walk without pain). I eventually went to emergency who diagnosed infection and given antibiotics. This diagnosis then went to a seroma, infected seroma, an abscess then when I saw my own surgeon consultant, he decided (eventually) that it was lymphoedema in the breast. I was told to wear a bra and manage the pain. That was it. Is that all the advice and treatment we get for this or should I be asking an expert what to do? My back, behind my shoulder is swollen and feels tender and I'm very worried that it is spreading. How do I avoid this? Most importantly, is there anything I can do to stop it spreading to my hand/arm/torso or is it just luck of the draw.Â  Where lymphoedema of the breast is concerned, there doesn't seem to be a whole lot of information out there. Can anyone else who's in the same boat, help and advise? Many thanks xxxx",
