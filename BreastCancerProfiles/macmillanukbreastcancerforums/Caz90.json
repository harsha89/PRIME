What definitely has come to light is the number 20 is a grey area but it's almost 8 weeks since my op(lumpectomy, my lymph nodes were clear) and 4months since the mammogram that detected the lump.  I'm feeling great, eating healthy, (breast cancer has made me open my eyes to the good and bad foods)regular exercise and a new job in the pipeline. Chemo in my opinion would be a step.backwards. I am prepared to live with my decision. ",

I did read that someone paid for an Endotype test? because they were in the grey area, it cost £1500 but only comes back with high or low.  I heavily side against chemo, my mum died from breast cancer she had chemo and I would say after it she didn't have good quality of life. My sister had breast cancer 3 yrs ago and said chemo was dreadful and made her really ill. I know many others too(frightening how many i do know who've had breast cancer) Of course if it was a case of 90%+ you won't get it back then chemo would be an easier decision.  I have done nothing but read up on the test for the last 2 weeks and have yet to find something that will convince me to have chemo. I asked the nurse if the Oncologist will pressurise me, she assured me he wouldn't.  I now play the waiting game again. ",

      "Content": "Sounds like me Ruby, My mum died of breast cancer and she lost her hair through chemo and she told me she'd felt embarrassed at times because people had commented on how nice her hair looked, it was a wig so she had to start to explain. Messaging lets you tell lots of people and I suppose I had lists A, B & C without even thinking about it. Luckily for me I don't need chemo just radiotherapy.  Even so I don't really remember the last few months it's all kind of been a haze and however bad it is we all come out the other side. Caz.xx",

      "Content": "Also now I know some may not agree but I put a post on Facebook. I told close family and friends though.  I posted when I'd been diagosed and again when anything changed. I got lots of messages of support. It also created an awareness of breast cancer especially the fact that sometimes there are no symptoms and you don't always know there's a lump there until you have the mammogram.",
