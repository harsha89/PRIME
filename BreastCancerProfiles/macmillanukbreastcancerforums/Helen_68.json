    "Content": "Hi, I'm new to the group, I had a bilateral mastectomy on 8th May with tissue expanders and now have areas of necrosis on both sides. One side is worse than the other and my consultant is waiting to see how deep the necrosis is. The possibility is that the expanders are removed and this reconstruction is lost. Does anyone have any experience of this, the wait is very difficult for me right now.Â ",
