      "Content": "Hi Lynn Thank you for your message. Not seen a solicitor yet I'll wait & see what my doctor has to say tomorrow. My right breast (good one) is even worse today. More small water blisters on it. When I got the port fitted more than one person said its down too low but I think also the port was defective as I keep getting told it's rare for it to happen. My husband even called USA a company in Cleavland Chemo Care to see if they've heard or had issues with a port leakage she said no & again she said it's rare, she also explained when they couldn't get the blood out for blood tests they should not have continued with the Taxol she was quite shocked to hear how my breast is.  Again thank you for replying to me  Kind regards  Love & Hugs  Linda X X ",

      "Content": "Hi All I only found out on the 31st Oct I have breast cancer on my left side & a week later was informed that it had spread to my lymph nodes. Long story short on my 5th weekly treatment which was last Thursday 22nd Dec I have had a leakage from my port with Taxol. My right breast is so red & hot with water blisters I had to see my consultant today, they gave me an xray & it was confirmed that my tube from my port has came off. This is why the taxol has gone straight into my breast tissue. I am checking to see if this has happened to anyone else as I was told this is a very rare thing to happen with the port. I was also informed that I will probably lose that breast now. Thanking you in advance for any of your comments & replys.  Linda",

      "Content": "Hi Carolyn Thank you for replying. Like most of us you don't take in all the information. When I seen my doctor yesterday as the pain & redness was getting worse plus more water blisters appeared I told him the nurses couldn't get blood from my port but still went ahead with the Taxol he said they should've called him first & told him about the problem. I will speak to the patient liaison because I've tried to get information about this problem but keep hitting a brick wall as they say it's very rare for it to leak inside the breast.  Big hugs  Linda X X ",
