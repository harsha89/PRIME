      "Content": "Hi Ladies. Just wondering... I have had lumpectomy and start my rads on 24th June for four weeks. I have been signed off sick from work since 1st May. I dont want to return to work before my treatment ends which will be end of July. The works nurse however, thinks I should return while Im having my rads. What she doesnt realise is that I have to travel a fair few miles every day for four weeks for the rads and will no doubt be knackered. How long did any ladies in similar situation take off work?  IE: Lumpectomy, no chemo, rads and tablets...xxxx",

      "Content": "Hi. New to this posting lark so bear wirth me! I have just been diagnosed with invasive ductal cancer but luckily only Grade 1. Have been told I probs wont need Chemo, just Radiotherapy. On readiing some of the discussions on here I am very lucky and my cancer is a mere walk in the park!! Still bit worried though. The invasisve bit worries me slightly as Im worried it could spread but presume cos its grade 1 they have caught it early enough. Im having a lumpectomy and sentinal node thingy in two weeks. How do you all cope financially? Im a single parent with two young kids and am VERYworried about the money situation. I have critical illness cover but assume I wont becovered as Im only Grade 1????",
