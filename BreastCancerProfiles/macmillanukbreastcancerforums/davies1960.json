I have previously said if it ever happened to me I would have them both taken away but now it has I am scared stiff of loosing them!!! It is good to know I am not alone though Love to you all xx",

      "Content": "Thanks very much. My MRI scan is booked for 30th August with the MDT meeting the following Tuesday. Hopefully then I will get an appointment to tell me what the plans are.  I have started to tell the people I work with now which has been surprisingly difficult but they have all been amazing.  With them on my side this cancer can look out.......... Still I think I am going to need this little group of people who know exactly what it is like more than I care to admit so thanks for being here xxx",

      "Content": "hi everyone Hope you are all feeling a bit better today I have had my MRI scan and have my appointment on Weds to find out what they plan to do next. I have to agree that it does seem very unreal at the moment.... although I know on the one hand its true on the other I can quite believe it.  I have just started to tell people in a hope that I may start to accept this news. My family, friends and even work colleagues have been amazing and I have a right little army behind me ready to kick some ass !!!  It doesn't stand a chance really. It is quite hard telling people I feel embarrassed. I know I shouldn't but its hard not to some times especially if it is a male colleague who I have worked with for over twenty years.  There has been a lot of hugs and kisses and offers of support.
