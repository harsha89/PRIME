Just eating what i fancy, prior to diagnosis, lost 3.5 stone with s w, thats how i found lump , boobs less dense. On antibiotics as had sore throat, but as a precaution, just be vigilant re getting infections and check your temperature, i am an ex nurse so may be a bit more paranoid and make a poor patient x",
