      "Content": "Hi All  I'm new to Tamoxifen too so very interested in this post, I have had a couple of weeks on RelonChem which seemed (I am putting it down to this anyway) to give me an urgency in the bladder department ..... not a route I want to go down!  Now off the tabs whilst having Radiotherapy (last one tomorrow! woo hoo!!) and things seem to have settled a little - has anyone else had this effect? I've just picked up a new prescription of Mylan (Tamoxifen) so will have to see how it goes with these.  Anyone tried them? I've not long finished chemo (April - EC-T x 8) so it's difficult to know if the achy bones are still chemo related or from the Tamoxifen. Best wishes ",
