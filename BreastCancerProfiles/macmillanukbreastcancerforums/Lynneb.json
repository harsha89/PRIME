    "Content": "Hi. I had a lumpectomy and sentinel node biopsy on 10 May for Grade 2 invasive cancer.  However, I ended up with an infection so had antibiotics and then found out my margins were not clear and would  need a re incision when  infection sorted.  Had second op on 21st June.  Four days after the op I started to feel really under the weather, sick and tired.  My boob swelled twice its size and was painful. I had it drained 4 times. It's currently draining  through my lumpectomy scar.  On my second lot of antibiotics.  Have to wait till infection clears before i can start radio and hormone therapy.  The good news surrounding all this doom and gloom is the results from my second op is my margins are CLEAR, so was all worth it in the end ",
