    "Content": "Hi.  I was diagnosed with a grade 3 cancer in my right breast at the end of May and when I saw the surgeon was told an op on the NHS could be up to 31 days away.  Like you my  head was all over the place and so we elected to get the mastectomy privately and it was done in 7 days. The cost was £6500.  I see you are to have a lumpectomy which would not be so expensive.   From memory I think I was quoted about £3000 for a lumpectomy but decided to  go for a full mastectomy and it turned out I made the right decision as things were more complicated than at first thought. ",
