    "Content": "Hi. I'm just looking for some of your knowledge and experiences please.  My mum found a lump (under her armpit - lymph node) went to the docs 2 days later. She went to the hospital today to get it checked and the scans show calcification in some of the breast tissue near the lymph node. She has got to go back on in Thursday and has the detailed hour long scan and then get the results of the biopsy taken today next week.  Does anyone have any experience of this, my mum has never had a health scare like this, she is 58.",
