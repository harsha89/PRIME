    "Content": "Hi, I am new to the group and it is great to find you. I am currently undergoing radiotherapy following a right mastectomy and chemo. I am on number 9 of 15 radiotherapy and I have developed rib pain on the radiotherapy side. Has any one else experienced this? Quite anxious in case it's not a side effect and is something more serious.",
