    "Content": "Hi Nikki, I am the same as you lumpectomy and radiotherapy and the not so lovely Anastrazole.  I was diagnosed on 8th December last year and have my first mammogram on Monday, not looking forward to that and the waiting for the results. Hopefully it won\u2019t take too long.   I too count myself lucky as it was found early via my routine mammogram, I had no lump or any other sympthoms....but have been absolutely fine.",
