    "Content": "HI.  I hope you don't mind me popping into your group to join the discussion.  I thought you might like to hear about some of the comments made about Brave the Shave at the support group that I go to.  I knew that there was growing opposition to this campaign but I had not realised how widespread it had become. Most of the ladies there have been through treatment for breast cancer.  They were all upset and angry about the campaign and it became the main topic of conversation.  A nurse said she is beginning to hear negative talk in the waiting room.  She recently spoke to a couple of patients who were so distressed by it that she is considering making a complaint to Macmillan. Another lady said she is cancelling her monthly direct debit for her donation to Macmillan and others indicated that they might do the same.  A coffee morning to raise funds for Macmillan has been called off.  We usually pass round a Macmillan collection tin at the end of the meeting but nobody wanted to donate anything.   One chap clearly summed up the mood when he angrily said that he no longer wants to support a charity that is not listening to the people it is supposed to be helping.  He got a standing ovation.  ",
