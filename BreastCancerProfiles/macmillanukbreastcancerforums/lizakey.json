      "Content": "hi Valeie-Anne, I too had the same experience as you. My first treatment was in a private hospital and the B.C. Nurse told everyone about her own experience. That did nothing to re-assure me, I neede to discuss my fears.  Like you, I suffered from depression, and feel she used this to dismiss my feelings. unfortunately, I was diagnosed again, but in the other breast. The B.C. Nurse I had, never returned my texts that I sent her. She didn't visit me after my mastectomy until the day before I left hospital. I had no after-care from her and this was a large teaching London hospital. i was recommended The Haven - for me it's in London. They do amazing work for women with breast cancer. If you can assess them, do try. You can also access them online. didn't have chemo, but could chat bout other things, certainly depression, which is under control for me. liz x",
