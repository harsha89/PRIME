      "Content": "Hi all, I had a mammo on Monday 13th, which revealed micro calcification clusters in my right breast! I was totally shocked as i had been referred to the clinic for a swelling under my armpit, but the armpit looked normal on the US. But my magnified mammogram revealed micro calcification clusters in my right breast and I was scheduled for 2 core biopsies. Had them done on Thursday results on the 28th as consultant is on holiday. I am going out of my mind with worry, and feel like I am having mini panic attacks every 30 mins or so. Any tips on how to cope with the wait and roller coaster of emotions? And has anyone had similar mammo readings to mine which turn out to be cancer? Sorry for the long post, just so scared. ",

      "Content": "Hi, its the first doctor I saw on my initial appointment who is away on holiday, I had a different lovely doctor for my biopsy and just don't understand why she can't give me the results. As I say I am not normally shy of asking what's going on, but I think I am in shock at the moment. Plus I don't actually live on the mainland, so I am thinking maybe that is a factor too. I know if it is cancer then its is early and for that I am thankful for I just don't feel prepared for this roller coaster journey but then who ever is? But I am glad to have found this site and I am finding it a great source of comfort reading all the support everyone gives each other. thanks for your reply x",

      "Content": "Thank you to all who have replied. I have since given myself a good metaphorical kick up the back side! I am focusing on being positive now. The odds on a benign outcome are in my favour, and I probably should not have joined this site before a positive diagnosis, but I was researching the internet and thought by focusing on forums rather than overload myself by googling the medical info and terrifying myself in the process.  But after a horrible weekend I am now much more positive and just trying to wait my time out for the results.  Thank you all, you have already calmed down my fears and that is why I suppose I joined. Wishing everyone well on their journey's xx",

      "Content": "Hi Pat, thank you for replying to my post. I know I shouldn't panic, I think it is just the diving into the unknown. I am trying to be positive (most of the time) just wish I didn't have to wait so long to find out. I also felt like i was being a tad over dramatic and wasting everyone's time but deep down I was quite confident it wouldn't be anything sinister as i couldn't feel any breast lumps. But this has completely shell- shocked me. And when I was sent back down my paper in hand to give to the x-ray department for my magnified mammo i read the bit where it says Cancer suspected and it said yes. I know that doesn't necessarily mean I have cancer but it did really scare me and I never asked the doctor at my core biopsy a thing which is totally out of character for me. As I normally want to know every thing that's going on. She did ask if I had an appointment for the results, I said yes on my son's birthday and she said  'oh bugger' which again has sent me in to panic mode thinking 'she knows its Cancer'.  I will take you're advice and maybe write down the things that I would like to ask, and I am trying to find ways to cope with my anxiety. thanks again for replying x",

I feel much like yourself, I have also spoken to people and so many people have been through it or know someone who has, so we CAN do this! :D I just wanted to wish you well for your op on Thursday and please keep us posted of your progress as my op steadily approaches too it would be great to hear from you.  Ruby x",

      "Content": "first of all I am so sorry for your diagnosis, i am still waiting on my results. But I can understand how anxious you must feel about telling your parents and children. Maybe telling the children after you get your treatment plan will help you understand what lies ahead and maybe prepare you for all the questions they may have. There is no doubt this will be an emotional time for you and your family but with the support of our loved ones it can make the journey seam a little less scary. Big hugs Carrie, I will be thinking of you xx",
