I know I took a small chance. But if the Cancer comes back I will have no way of knowing whether or not it would have done so even if I had had the chemo. So if it does, I will just have to deal with it!",

In 2013 my husband was diagnosed with lung cancer.  I had the lump excised, radiotherapy, and tamoxifen and at my last check up I was clear. I cared for my husband through chemo, radiotherapy, tumour spread, and finally until he died in December 2014. People on here have been a great support for me, I could not have come this far without their help.",

Lots of people in a confined space, and lots of bugs so quite a risk. The same might also be true of a cruise ship. You would need to take advice from your oncologist on this. Also if you think of travelling without insurance especially on a cruise be aware of the costs of medical evacuation. I have seen figures of £10,000 quoted if you need to fly back with a medical escort, and I have no idea how much emergency evacuation from a ship would cost. Maybe you could plan a holiday away in the uk somewhere? ",

Nothing major. i find it harder to lose weight, but I haven't put any on. I think that people who have finished other treatments and have no problems on tamoxifen are often just out there getting on with life.

Your employer has to make reasonable adjustments to support you in returning to work as you are now classed as having a disability.
