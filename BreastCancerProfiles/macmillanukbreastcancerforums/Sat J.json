    "Content": "HI I loved coffee I must have had 6 cups of black coffee a day, since Chemo in March I have not touched it.  I have really struggled infection after infection, metalic mouth, lots of ulcers, fatigue, blurred vision, spasms in my back, but what I focus on is each day is a day closer to the end.  I have one chemo left I just can not believe how time has flown.   What I found was that each Chemo brought different symptoms some were better others were worse I think it is very individual just take each day as it comes and stay positive as it is mind set that really helps recover. All the best. X",
