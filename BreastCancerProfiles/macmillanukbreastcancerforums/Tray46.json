      "Content": "Thank you Leolady56 . I chatted to my hubby tonight, and he felt sad, and knew that I had pushed him away, he did not know what to say or do, around me , as he thought I was angry at him. I told him, you work all day, your tired, stressed,   I did not want to moan about my cancer, the lack of sleep, the numbness , being uncomfortable , he said I want to know about everything, everyday I love you and want to be there for you  Thank you for your support",

      "Content": "Hello everyone  New member here. My moto - never in a million years I would get cancer and here I am writing this hoping for some reassurance,  comfort I'm 46, found a lump got referred, they found , lump was fine, but after the mamogram,  and ultrasound they found microcalifisions,  had biopsy , got told 5th Dec 2018 i had high grade DCIS 77mm tumor.  What a blur, I did not have a option, had to have full left breast nipple sparing Masectomy & sentinel node biopsy,  and reconstruction, gel implant ,  I got so confused, - i know a few friends that have had breast cancer, lump found , and they have lumpectomy!, but even though I was early diagnosed I loose my boob!! January 2nd 2019, had operation, and now I'm 3 weeks further on. Went to get my results last Thursday, I was nervous,  scared, anxious- to be told sorry we have them here but they have not been discussed with the \"Team\" yet ,... Roll on this Thursday 31st, but my mind is going like the clappers, does that mean it's bad news, my husband pushed, the consultant, he said, \"In MY opinion no more surgery needed\", so I'm thinking it's not in the nipple, or the lymph nodes!!! But I'm at a lost, emotionally, it's hard, I found a peasize lump above my chestwall a couple of days ago, so that is worrying me, could be from my gel implant or something else, paranoier sets in My husband is great, but i feel like he is saying......you have had the operation, im sure everything is fine, you can go back to work soon!, sort of saying get on with it! I feel so emotional,  I can talk to family,  but if I mention it to friends I get all upset, and struggle, I was having a hard time with my teenage daughters and if I mention cancer I get upset! When..., how... do you move on, suppose I'm struck in limbo at the moment waiting for my results Xxx",

      "Content": "Hello Thank you for getting I touch, lovely words of advise , you are  right about teenages Tbh they don't understand the full name cancer, not like us that worry indully.  They knew I had a biopsy and cancer was found, and my eldest who is 13 said it was \"scooped\" out when I had surgery, they don't know what a Masectomy is and at this age (2 girls other one is 11) I am not telling them. How do u find your gel implant? it feels so weird as there is no feeling, and weird like stinging nettles on my arm and under the boob,  my armpit has healed now, but  when I go out and it's cold, god my boob really hurts!! I'm still hoping my DCIS stayed in the milk duct but can't help but read websites then regret it, this why I thought of joining this site. I am sensitive and always think of other people, and I am never ever poorly, this why I am struggling and feel guilty for having my 4th week off recuperating! Cancer is so invisible,  no-one would know unless you tell them. I have a breast care nurse,  but find it hard to talk to her, as I don't know her, I feel like I am shutting away as people are probably bored of hearing!! I know it's not true, but I can feel myself doing it,, I'm not a person who throws my toys out the pram (So to speak), and just get on with it Roll on Thurs,  hugs back at u Xx",
