I cannot stop thinking about what happened to mum and I know that my family are too and this makes the uncertainty even scarier having seen the effects of BC first hand. I have been told that they don't do mammograms on younger women is this true? X",

My GP also found nodulation, what does this mean? I have received an appointment for the breast clinic, but was wondering what will happen there? I'am understandably scared, any advice will be greatly appreciated. X",
