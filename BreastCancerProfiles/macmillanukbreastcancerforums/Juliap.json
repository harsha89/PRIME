      "Content": "Hi Nicky Good luck to you for Thursday, i'm sure everything will go well for you. I haven't had the Tamoxifen so unsure of the side effects, but i'm sure other will be able to give you some info on that. Stay strong, take time to relax and put yourself first and rest when you need to. Julia xx",

      "Content": "Hi Lin I had my lumpectomy in August last year and even now find it uncomfortable to wear an underwired bar. My scar is underneath my breast so the wires rub on it constantly if I wear one.  If your scar is elsewhere on your breast you may be able to wear one sooner. I do think though that it is a little soon for you to be wearing one, but i'm not an expert. I'm sure your Breast care nurse will be able to give you some advice. Good luck Julia xx",
