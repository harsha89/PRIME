    "Content": "Hi suzyjane I had the exact same operation as you last december don't be afraid. First of all its great that you are having the cancer removed and second of all you are going to have amazing new boobs! Have you spoken to your doctors about your worries and concerns? Make a list of questions I always find that it helps. And if you think of anything else we are all here. I stayed in the hospital for a week with mine and then had a month off work. Make sure you ask your doctors about how long they recommend for you. You will feel tired too so plan to have a rest and a sleep every day. If your family are not being supportive then call up some friends and make them aware of what is happening to you. I am not married myself so can't give advice regarding your husband and boys but maybe they feel that they are scared themselves and don't really understand because it's womens stuff? Do you have any female family members who you can speak to? work colleagues?Â  Please ask me anything you need about the operation. xx",
