      "Content": "Hi Squirrel I have gone down the reverse route - had the TAX first and now on the FEC.  The TAX will affect people in different ways, unfortunately for me the first one hit me hard - but I got through the otherside and within a week of having it I started to feel a little better.  The 2nd/3rd dose wasn't as bad as I think I got used to it!  I got the doctor to prescribe me some Cordysol mouthwash which helped a lot with mouth problems.  I also got told to moisturise your hands, feet and nails with cream to help with the skin/nail problems (which was too late for me as they look like a manicurist worst nightmare!) Make sure you listen to your body and rest as much as you can  Take care ",
