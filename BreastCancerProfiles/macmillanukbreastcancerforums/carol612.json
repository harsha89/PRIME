      "Content": "Hi Bev, I am going for 4th cycle of FEC on Tuesday. I have actually lost weight while on Chemo...I don't think weight gain is inevitable. I would say I eat healthily, avoid sugar etc, and exercise. Yes, steroids do increase your appetite, but I find while on the steroids I don't really want to eat anything, probably the nausea the first few days after infusion.(they do keep me awake all night though) thing is we are all different and side effects are too. I must say that I have found it much harder to bounce back mentally and phsically after this cycle, the cumulative effect, and I am not looking forward to going in for next one...but on we go. Sorry this wasn't really much help Carol xx",

      "Content": "Hi Fiona, We went through DX and treatment on a similar time scale. I too feel very underwhelmed by the lack of follow up care. We have all read about possible long term effects of chemo on the heart, liver, thyroid etc. And was warned about these before I started chemo. My last appointment with the oncologist was very disappointing, he waved his hand and dismissed theses worries and said chemo side effects are short term, no scans, no blood tests, nothing.....its up to you to tell if something is not right!!! Very awe inspiring!  Well, I thought at least I'll go to my doctor and get a full blood screen after the end of chemo, as raised caclium, CEA levels and other things can be detected in the blood. She was very sweet, but to be honest I knew more about breast cancer than she did. However, she agreed that we would do a full blood screen every six months. I feel we all have to be our own advocates. Sadly, we only seem to get somethings if we push for them. I know, after treatment we are to get on with our lives, and I agree with that and I have thought about   stopping visits to this site, as amazing as it has been, and I truly mean that, it also causes anxiousness.  This is new territory, and I guess we have to get used to it and I think it is pretty standard all over the world, I don't think scans are given routinely, after treatment is finished.  Love Carol",

If it is a concern and doesn't feel right, I know it's hard to tell when nothing feels right!, you should call the triage number especially if it's due to high blood pressure. If it's more like a headache it could be dehydration, to do, do, persevere with the water and get it down you anyway you can, I swear it helps with the side effects.

Keep using the mouth wash and maybe salt water, if it is real bad, with ulcers, get a prescription. The only thing that tastes really bad for me is water and it is important to drink as much as you can, tea doesn't count I'm afraid, so I boil it and add lemon juice and it tastes better, you should drink about 2L a day.  Love, Carol",

You are already on the roller coaster, emotions and thoughts all over the place. All I can do is give you my opinion, but in the end you have to do what's best for you, because you are the one who must take control. Be kind to yourself. That does not mean you are being selfish. Tell people what YOU want them to know. Those YOU choose to tell, let them know how much YOU want to talk about it. Set your own boundaries. For example, most people diagnosed with cancer don't want to hear about the neighbour who has cancer, because it is not your story and every story is different. I told my best friend right away, because that's the relationship we have. I didn't tell all family members right away, or work colleagues. It's all up to you....be kind to yourself.

You can't alter the past so forget about it. The future is unknown not just to you but to everyone, yes we might have to deal with the uncertainty that a cancer diagnosis brings but you will learn to live with it. It's the here and now you must focus on. Day to day. Keep you mind in the light. Your mind is powerful, it will try to pull you into the dark, but think about all the wonderful things that are in your life right now, try to feel some joy everyday. You are going through the worst part, the waiting....with time it will all get better. You are stronger than you think. When you are faced with cancer, you just get on with it, because there is no other choice. Get ready for the rollercoaster ride ahead, don't overwhelm yourself, be kind to yourself you can do this.

You have to remember who you are, you are a friend, a daughter, maybe a mother a sister, a wife, you are more than a breast.

      "Content": "Hi, I agree, yes it can be a nightmare. You say you don't feel brave or strong, and that is fine, it is okay to felel scared and overwhelmed. Try to take it as it comes. You will have the surgery because you have no choice and that knowledge will give you strength, you may not feel it right now but you are stronger than you know.   I have had a few shaky moments this week too. I have not really totally recovered from the last infusion and am due for cycle 4 on Tuesady. This may sound weird, but watching Eddie Izzard, run 27 marathons in 27 days was an inspiration, when people asked him how he did it he said, \" it's all in the head, I just kept saying to myself,\" keep going.\" Don't let your mind go to the dark side. You control your mind. You can do this, one step, one day at a time. Feel the love that is all around you and bathe in the light. YOU CAN DO THIS❤️ Love, Carol xxx",

      "Content": "Hi there, I had a mastectomy in December. I'd already had a lumpectomy so was prepared, it is the unknown that is scary. They will take you to a pre surgery room, and pump some medication into your vein. You are talking with them,chatting about this and that and the next thing is you wake up and it's all over! I had no  nausea from the anaesthetic, and had no physical pain from the incision, the drains caused me more discomfort, because they are something foreign in your body, but they came out painlessly after a day. You are having reconstruction so it will be different for you, but they will control any pain with medication and each day you will feel stronger and better. Good luck. Carol xxxx",

      "Content": "Hi there, This time last year, I was in a similar position to you. I had found a lump, went to the GP, who referred me to the breast clinic. Ultrasound, biopsy, consultant no too worried, the lump was smooth on the edges, he said cancerous lumps were usually jagged, but I would get the results in 10 days. Cancer. So the journey began and now it is over. You are at the scary stage, so many unknowns, so many thoughts racing through your head, the fear of dying, the disbelief, it is all normal and its how the cancer roller coaster begins. But you will survive and time will pass and you will be like me, getting on with your life again!...and after rereading your post you do t even have a diagnosis yet, so you might be lucky and it is not cancer.
