      "Content": "Hi everyone, Mum got diagnosed with breast cancer 6 weeks ago, on mammogram it was 1cm in size. Biopsy showed stage 2. She had removal of tumour with bilateral reconstruction as she was big busted. Got results back today and tumour is approx 4 times the size as first thought and in fact was 2 areas in her breast that didn\u2019t show on the mammogram. Her sentinel node Biopsy showed minuscule cancer. Plan now is for left mastectomy. They have given her the choice of 2 trials. 1st to have auxiliary node clearance during surgery or not. The 2nd is chemo and hormone therapy after surgery or just hormone treatment. I feel numb. Mum is obviously devasted, she has been so upbeat about it all, she cares for my dad who has MS. im Needing to hear some thoughts about chemo v\u2019s hormone only treatment and success stories. It\u2019s hard to stay positive all the time. Life can be so cruel!!! Much love and prayers to everyone out there. Dawn x.  Results are as follows 38mm tumour, Grade 2 Ductal, oestrogen positive / progesterone negative, Her 2 negative.  ",

      "Content": "Sorry to hear you are on this journey, I\u2019ve just begun the journey with my Mum who has grade 2 ER positive HerS negative, she had lumpectomy and bilateral reconstruction (due to being big busted) for what they said was a 1cm tumour, on getting results it turns out the tumour was 38mm with a second area of suspicion and minuscule amount of disease in the sentinel node. Her margins are 0.5mm and is now going back for left mastectomy, reconstruction and auxiliary node clearance. The surgeon said they want a clear margin of 1mm like you mentioned. You should discuss this with your consultant on her return as well as your oncologist if you have one. Ask if they have any stats etc and no harm in asking what they would want done if it was them which will hopefully make things clearer as to your next step. Good luck, love and hugs your way Dawn x",
