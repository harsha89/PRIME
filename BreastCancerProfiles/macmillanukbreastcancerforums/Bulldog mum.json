      "Content": "Hi Anne, thank you for your reply. So glad you got yours sorted and are no longer in pain. I am due to see the surgeon again next week and if I am still getting pain I will ask them to remove the port as soon as they have finished topping up the implant. Did you have your implant put under your muscle or on top? How long does it take for the swelling to go down? At the minute I can\u2019t see they will ever need to top up the implant because it feels like its about to burst through my skin its that taught. Also was there much bruising? Sorry to keep asking questions but I much prefer to speak to someone who has been through it rather than reading available info cos it doesn\u2019t always give you a try picture. Glad you are doing ok now . Sending a hug back. Lesley xx",

      "Content": "Hi thank you for your reply. i had the drain out yesterday and it did provide quite a bit of relief, so that\u2019s good. I just hope that this port on my ribs stops hurting soon. It doesn\u2019t hurt to touch it, just when I move, breathe and talk. I have phoned the hospital for advice and they just said give it a couple more days and if still hurting to phone them and they will try to get me in and let the surgeon take a look. So fingers crossed it will get better soon. Many thanks",

      "Content": "Hi AnneCC thank you so much for your reply it\u2019s been very helpful. The pain seems to be subsiding a bit each day so fingers crossed i\u2019m on the mend. Did you eventually have your expander implant removed or just the port? My surgeon uses permanent expander implants and leaves the port in unless the patient insists the port is removed after appropriate expansion. How kind does it take for the swelling to subside? I know its early days (I am only day 5 post op) but at the minute there is no room to expand the implant. Everything still feels very tight and full.  Many thanks",

      "Content": "Hi everyone, I am new to this club having been diagnosed with DCIS 5 weeks ago. I had a single mastectomy and immediate reconstruction on Thursday.  I came home from hospital the following morning. I have had to have an implant put in but my surgeon uses a permanent expander implant but I am in so much pain, where the expander port sits near my ribs, that it takes my breath away. No pain meds seem to be helping. Has anyone else experienced this and can you offer any advice? The district nurse is coming again today and maybe taking my drain out which I am a bit worried about cos it that too soon? Could this help stop some of the rib pain near the port if the drain is taken out. No pain anywhere else to be honest, just muscular tightness from the implant. Thank you in advance, for any advice you can give. xxx",
