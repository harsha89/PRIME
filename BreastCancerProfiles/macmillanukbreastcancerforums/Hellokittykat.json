    "Content": "I had a mastectomy yesterday due to 10cm area of microcalcification, and a 7mm tumour of grade 2 DCIS. They tested 3 sentinel lymph nodes, and 2 of them came back positive. I'm confused about it all now and am waiting for staging CT scan. Has anyone got any experience of this? Does it mean I have an invasive cancer? I will speak to my breast care nurses later, but this all seems so important at 4amÂ ",
