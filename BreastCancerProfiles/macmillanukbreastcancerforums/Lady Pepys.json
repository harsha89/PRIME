      "Content": "Dear Fairyelephant, How I feel for you having to worry about this. Julia has given you excellent practical advice already so I just want to wish you the best. Yes, people do have instinctive feelings that something is wrong but they can be mistaken about the severity of it.  I had a nasty discharging cyst for months on my left breast and did nothing about it...that is, I didn't go to the doctor. It cleared up. But another thickened area on the same breast was not benign. They were not connected as far as I know. I had mammo and ultrasound at my first appointment and actually yes, it was quite obvious to the sonographer it was suspicious so they did a biopsy.  Great you have your mum with you to take notes and give you support. I'm keeping my fingers crossed your instinct was exaggerated concern. Keep us posted and chin up... Pepys xx",

I\u2019ve never had anything fancy done to mine, have lost them twice and am due to lose them again with new chemo next week.  I have a selection of eyebrow pencils etc in light brown which are great. Also a crayon-type thing from Rvlon (Colorstay) which has a brush at one end. Gives a lovely natural look. But I bet you know all about these in3Years plus of eyebrow research. To be honest I actually prefer the neater look my eyebrows had after chemo. I pluck them a bit more now to recapture the glamour! I feel that thinner brows give the face more definition. I can\u2019t say the same for eyelashes. What a drag it is to lose them. I bought lots of false eyelashes but have never worn them! Pepys xx",

I am also struggling, if I may say, womanfully. It's been decided that for the rest of my chemo I'll have filgrastim injections, the first of which was given to me..day 3..yesterday. I'll hopefully do them myself though in truth I'm being quite dopey and struggling to take my medication correctly! The GP has decided I have a cellulitis infection of my breast..I mean, of course, the mangled surgical site where my lovely left breast used to be. So I am now on my third lot of antibiotics. Oh joy! To be honest, it's not that bad. No changes in taste, no mouth ulcers, no loss of appetite, sense of humour. Just lack of energy. Yes, we shall not flag. Not much anyway.

Of course I would like to keep mine, not exactly a crowning glory but a shiny little mop of fine auburn hair, cut in a bob. I was SO happy that, at 56, I hadn't gone grey. Now, I didn't expect things to turn out quite like this...I'm glancing over at my eerie lookalike wig on its polystyrene stand and wondering when I'll wear it. I'm the sort of woman who doesn't leave the house without lip stick so you can imagine this whole cancer business is a worry!  I haven't been married for 20 years but have had relationships since then. I don't really dwell on whether anyone will want me. I always suppose they will because I see myself as more than the sum of my (missing) parts! Hopelessly optimistic! The last few days have felt quite difficult for me emotionally. I know what you mean about the smell of the chemo room. There's a memory that will stay with me forever. Feeling quite zonked out still on day 5. I know my side effects are nothing like as bad as I feared but god do I wish I had the customary spring in my step! The sea is 5 minutes from where I'm staying with friends. My aim is to get there, walk to town (and back) along the seafront, buy flowers and simply shift myself out of this torpor. Will I manage? I'll feed back later on my adventures. Love to you Katherine and to you all who've posted on here.  Xxx",

At least you did something about your lump as soon as you discovered it. In my case I did not, not because I was afraid but because it wasn't a lump but a thickening and I honestly thought it would be a cyst, a fibroadenoma, changes I had had before. Of course I eventually consulted my doctor who made an immediate referral.i didn't torment myself with worry and had an Easter trip to Copenhagen booked to see my brother. I did mention to my brother and his wife though not  to any of my three sons. I don't have a husband.  As far as I was concerned, there was still a good chance it may be benign. Mine turned out not to be but yours still might!  I was glad I didn't discuss with my sons until actual diagnosis because it would have been needless worry for the. They are in their twenties and thirties. My middle son is inDubai and would have fretted a great deal.  I actually got a diagnosis in the ultrasound room so no real delay there. It must have been quite obvious! At that point I started to let the family know. My sons were obviously upset but have dealt with it really well and so, in fact, have I!  I do so hope your lump turns out to be benign, as so many are.. 80% I believe. If it is not then it is still likely, as mine is, to be early and very treatable. Keep these things in mind, try to stay calm and lean on your lovely husband. I will be thinking of you. Pepys xx",

Drug addict or what!  I hate codeine but there's no denying it works.  I have an appointment soon with an orthopaedic surgeon and will be interested to see what s/he recommends.  Is the rapid ipuprofen lysine an over-the-counter drug?

Was the cancer in your left breast and you fear the effects of radiation on the heart?  I was also very concerned about radiation, not particularly for that reason (though it was my left breast which was affected).  My surgeon said radiotherapy does have potential to damage the heart though the risk is very small indeed.  I was more concerned about the state of my breast pre-radiotherapy (purple, sore and inflamed) and whether rads would make it worse.  I had a tissue expander, which was not settling well.  Later I had this removed, the problem turned out to be not rads but chemo, which had caused bleeding under the skin.  Right now, it's quite comfortable. Hopefully someone who has experience of AF will get back to you..but what we all have in common is bloody worry and anxiety over tests.  I'm afraid I sometimes just pour a glass or two of wine and that helps..not that I'm advising you turn to the bottle ! It's hard to concentrate when you're anxious and you need to turn to your favoured distractions, whatever they are.  Sunday's not a great day for us worriers, is it?

Well, give us something we'll wear.  And in all sizes! It's true you don't have to wear post-surgery bras.  I've bought full-cupped types and just popped the prosthesis inside but it's less comfortable.  As for wires, forget it.

I have no idea if it will fool any of the people any of the time..though it does look good. Soon I will have a bald patch on top so I need to take decisive action. Like you, Emma, I have no desire to look at my bald bonce and don't want to put any of my friends through the trauma of shaving it for me. This is all very silly because I am a confident and flamboyant type..not tried pink hair though!! Not having hair makes me feel very vulnerable. Oh god, what to do?! Pepys xxx",

Unlike you I have fine, straight, hair..still quite 'trademark' cut in precise bob. I don't know if I'll continue with cold cap though it does sound as if it could work well for you..a bit of thinning wouldn't be disastrous. My second chemo was due today but can't go ahead yet due to low blood count.. So I'm guessing I'll be looking at more of my hair on the bedroom floor!   My scalp has definitely been feeling tender in the last few days, especially on top! It feels better if I wrap a scarf around it. Good luck with cold cap. Certainly seems the process works best for your hair type. Pepys xx",

      "Content": "Hello Valerie-Ann, I'll agree with the other ladies here and say that walking is the best bet for keeping the weight off.  I started Letrozole just after Christmas, having put on around half a stone after the end of FEC chemo.  Not too worried about it as I am still within normal weight range (11st and 5 foot 8).  I haven't actually noticed Letrozole making me eat more but it's possible it will...early days!  I returned to work at the beginning of January and although I immediately threw myself back into my 20-mile a week walking routine (also to save money avoiding zone 1 on my way to and from work!),  I have recently cut back a bit.  Last week I started radiotherapy (having 5 weeks) and noticed I felt very tired indeed.  So for the next few weeks, I'm cutting myself some slack! Walking is great exercise though.  I was delighted that my recent bone density scan shows no problems whatsoever.  The joints are a different matter altogether!  However, as others have testified, walking does help to ease the aches and pains.  I'd like to start swimming again but obviously not able to until radiotherapy is finally over. I am sure that your weight will come off slowly and gradually and really that's the best way because it will stay off.  One of my work colleagues has been on Letrozole for 5 years (and the previous 5 on Tamoxifen).  She is now fitter than she was before but admits that her diet is far healthier than before she was diagnosed.  Incidentally she had stage 3 cancer with a lot of lymph node involvement so this is very encouraging.  It's good to see that many women do very well on this drug as you usually only hear about the problems. Onwards and upwards. Pepys xxx    ",

One does get hassled here a lot but I'm developing tactics to spend my time peacefully!  There was a moment during my treatment - perhaps more than one - when I wondered if I'd ever regain full confidence but I believe I have. And without wanting to sound like an evangelist, I'd really recommend lone travel. It reminds you of who you were before and who you can be again. I've needed people a bit more during this trip...not quite up to scratch yet...and I've spent more than I normally would on transport and other luxuries but what the hell.  Mountain trekking was great fun.  I had a personal guide, made clear I'd been ill and he was great.  And men still look, which has really boosted my self-esteem, vain creature that I am! Also, and quite importantly for me, I'm starting to write a little here, an activity I always used to enjoy before the cancer treatment made me feel so alien. It really does feel like getting away can bring you nearer to yourself! Pepys xx",

My overall feeling is that I can cope with whatever is thrown at me and those things I can control, I do. It is certainly true that some of the cancer treatments can drain you of your will to have fun but it's worth a try during the moments of respite to arrange pleasurable things to do.  Going away alone has really restored my confidence in my own strength and I got to do some writing which has made me feel alive again.  And guess what...at some point, I was actually troubled by...ahem...lustful thoughts (mainly about delicious waiter). I was quite surprised by this...and in fact didn't even recognise the feelings at first but when you think about it, lust for life, whether for food, sex, new sensations, all spring from the same inbuilt urge for life and survival. But yes, thoughts of hanky-lanky caught me off-guard. This might be best explored in a new thread? Pepys xx",

I was unable to have a full reconstruction at tge time due to needing radiotherapy. I did have a tissue expander but that had to be removed last June due to problems. Although I now live in Hastings, I still have my treatment in London. I only managed to get my name on the waiting list in May due to a series of mistakes made by the hospital. Made a formal complaint and got a long-winded written apology. But I'm still waiting and getting more and more frustrated. My surgery will be at Broomfield Hospital in Chelmsford. I was called for pre-op assessment on 20 September but since then have not received an appointment. After several desperate phone calls I was told (in a voicemail from the surgeon's admissions officer) that my surgery would now be 'sometime next year'. I have been unable to get through to anyone to ask what this means! I know this reconstruction is classed as non-essential surgery but I feel like a second-class citizen! I live on my own, far from family and need to plan my care. I'm also applying for jobs and don't even know how to manage telling future employers that I may be off for a few weeks. I'm trying to be honest but can't even tell them when this might be.  So this situation is having an impact on my life in every conceivable way. Is anyone else having similar problems? Pepys xx",

Not like I can afford it. I sent an email via the hospital's Breast Reconstruction Awareness website and a nurse called and left a message (I'd said I was confused about the differing opinions on how long the pre-op was valid). It appears it's 6 months and only the MRSA swab has to be repeated. As for how the NHS is run under the Tories, I've sadly had the opportunity to experience it for myself. I do really appreciate my care and wouldn't dream of unfairly targeting any medical personnel in my criticisms but you do sometimes get the impression of a system buckling under the strain. I would really like to move my care to Hastings where I now live but feel it's a case of 'the devil you know'! Did you have DIEP? Pepys xx",

      "Content": "Dear Mighty Mouse, Thank you so much for your reply. It has really helped. When I made a formal complaint about my care at Whipps Cross Hospital, they pretty much jumped to attention because my concerns were about really serious failings. I was invited to meet with the hospital to discuss. I think they thought I might take legal action (and I did think about it but realised the experience might not help me). The hospital made several changes to systems, which they detailed in their letter of apology. However, one thing they haven't addressed is my reconstruction date. It's one thing to send a pre-op appointment but since then not a word! My BCN was as helpful as she could be and when I last spoke to her in the summer she assured me it wouldn't be much longer.  My consultant at Whipps Cross asked the plastic surgeon (in my presence) if he couldn't speed things up as I'd been considerably mucked about by the hospital. He just shrugged. I do know what all these people are up against but it doesn't make me feel valued. You are right, they forget that we have lives to organise. My family want to help but they also need to plan for it!  Re my BCN, the last time I texted her, she asked me to communicate by email (copying in various other people). I think she'd probably snapped with my moaning so I haven't contacted her since. The poor woman!  What kind of recon did you have? I wonder if it's because I want DIEP (which my consultant) doesn't do, that I'm having to wait so long. Do you happen to know what the 'sell-by' date on the pre-op is? I was told 3 months by the anaesthetist at pre-op but 6 months by the plastic surgeon's PA.  I suppose they just have to keep repeating the pre-op? Pepys x",

The worst part of it was cold cap and, frankly, as I chose that I can hardly complain! Every day since then I have expected o  feel awful and so far it's been fine. I try to get out every day for a longish walk and I do feel this has helped me to stay on top. I make an effort with my appearance which also helps. Yesterday i had a little blip when I really crashed but lo and behold alright again today. I am well aware that everything could change but for now I still feel human, have an appetite and some energy. I'm trying to live in the moment! Love, Pepys",

      "Content": "Hello little one  As someone who\u2019s about to lose her hair for the third time, this sounds interesting. I\u2019ll have a closer look at the site later. The first thing that comes to mind for me is the irritation of not being able easily to get the thing off. Wigs can be very hot! Also, if one\u2019s remaining hair is \u2018integrated\u2019 with the wig, what happens when remaining hair drops out, dhich it can do so rather quickly.which I guess necessitates a trip to the practitioner. They seem to have several branches.  I\u2019ll certainly look at this. Perhaps their methods keep the scalp cooler than a normal wig? I have a couple of wigs and have in fact bought a couple of reconditioned ones from a site called Wigbank. Very cheap!  I also have a number of great hats which really do help to divert attention from lack of hair and just feel glamorous. Actually, I hated the loss of my eyelashes more than everything else. But that\u2019s another chapter! Pepys xx",

      "Content": "Dear Fiona, I totally understand how draining it is to have pain.  I am really shocked how quickly the hip and joint pain has deteriorated in recent weeks.  Even though I am a very cheerful sort, it does get me down sometimes.  I have been refusing to walk with a stick...now need to revise that decision if I to get about at all.  I don't have a car.  Sometimes, especially when I can't walk after getting out of bed, I don't even recognise myself.  I was a 'power-walker', always the first to get up and dance (still do but god is it difficult).  Pain really changes how you feel about yourself.  As you are a nurse, I guess you know quite a lot about pain relief etc.  I wish I did - I struggle to find the best way of managing and sometimes find myself out and about and unable to walk (bywhich time the painkillers are a bit late!)  I take paracetamol and ibuprofen or naproxen (but have run out of that).  I also have prescription strength codeine and try to avoid it unless things are really bad. I'm assuming your husband knows that when you tell him you don't want to be with him, it's the pain talking?  I live on my own (my children live in London and Scotland) so I tend to keep a lot of how I feel inside me.  Today a friend called and I surprised myself by suddenly bursting into tears about how pissed off I am, hate my house, hate my infirmity and would be better off dead.  NOw that last isn't true but I just wanted someone to know it's not all roses here.  Everybody says how marvellous and 'well' I look and, in my nastier moments, I think they're saying it so they don't have to help me out in any way.  I don't think that's very rational, is it?! Do you also have good days, Fiona?  I hope so.  Have you ever used anti-depressants?  I've taken Sertraline until quite recently and found them helpful but not everybody does.  Fear of death is quite real, isn't it?  And nobody can tell us to snap out of it because we are in the unenviable position of having a potentially life-threatening illness.  If that fear overrides all other pleasures in life,  then it would be worth seeking help, if it's occasional then being more vocal about how you feel, both at home, with your friends and on here, may help.  I know I'm helped by writing things down.

      "Content": "Dear Murphy, I do sympathise. It's disappointing when this wasn't the result you expected. I am sure your oncologist will explain clearly why chemo might be of benefit to you..sometimes it's a combination of factors. In my case, lobular cancer, 3 tumours and a higher than average rate of recurrence. I had micro metastases in one SLN which counts as negative but chemo is often recommended. I was very disappointed as I'd actually been told I would only need radiotherapy! I was not especially happy to be presented with  the choice of whether to have chemo. I understand why it's presented like this but the responsibility frightened me. I took careful note of what was told me then asked for the oncologist's personal opinion. Understanding percentage benefits is tricky and not that accurate. I opted for chemo to give myself the best possible chance.  I'd researched my particular cancer, grade and stage (grade 2 stage 2) and felt chemo was the safest option. And I also had to trust that my oncologist knew more than me! Very best of luck in your discussions and lots of love, Pepys xx",

      "Content": "Dear Fiona, I am so sorry you're feeling like this...surely not mad but sad. I was also a fit woman when I was diagnosed, aged 56.  I'm 18 months down the line and also walk with a limp.  The pain stops me sleeping but then again I wasn't a good sleeper before.  I also worry that pain is an indicator of spread though recent x-rays and scans show arthritis.  The pain is pretty much everywhere now, thanks to a year of Letrozole.  I bloody hate limping and was known for my super-fast walking before! I also forget words and wonder if that's the Letrozole. Do you mind my asking why you are so sure this will be your last Christmas?  Of course I think about these things too...especially today, a grim Sunday on my own.   I moved to Hastings in September and am really struggling trying to get things done in my unfit state. I've had so many little domestic problems in the last few days, it's SO depressing and today I'm tearful and generally cheesed off. Fiona, do you have a partner/children/friends nearby?  You need to talk.  Nobody will think you're mad and certainly not on here.  Consider yourself hugged. Pepys xx ",

      "Content": "Dear Jessie, I think cancers which are confined to the breast and haven't spread can be cured by mastectomy. If a cancer spreads then it can be treated but not cured as such. The chemo is a precautionary measure in your case. I was also surprised to hear the word cure but surgery is still the mainstay of treatment where breast cancer is concerned. I had a stage 2 grade 2 cancer.  3 tumours. Tiny bit of cancer in one node so have to have chemo but there is no evidence of spread. Each case is individual. Pepys xxx",

Now 21 months on from original diagnosis, I'm glad I did as I'm feeling well again. Of course my treatment is far from over.  I respected that my medical team had spent many years of study to be in a position to judge my best course of action.  That doesn't mean I accepted everything in blind faith. Being a questioning sort, I certainly queried some decisions, often at length. I have also complained when I needed to. Isn't this mutual respect the sort of thing that keeps the wheels of the NHS oiled? Pepys x",

      "Content": "Dear Julia, I took Annie's comment to mean that the majority of invasive breast cancers, left UNTREATED, will kill you sooner or later...and this is less often the case for DCIS.  Surely this is just plain speaking rather than scaremongering? Both of my great grandmothers on my father's side died from breast cancer before the age of 30. This was in around 1910. They were poor, living in Ireland and there was no treatment. My paternal aunt and cousin have  had lobular cancer, as I have, and are alive many years after diagnosis, having gone down the route of surgery, chemo, radiation and drugs.  I certainly think there's room for discussion about alternative healthcare...why not a combination of both, where practical? Having said that, where invasive cancers are concerned I believe the scientifically proven route will  give us our best chance. The fact we are even able to discuss it in this way is a luxury my grandmother never had. Love to all. Pepys xx",
