      "Content": "Hi Kay Like you I had two surgeries and I am left with what some people may regard as an ugly scar and if I am honest at first that is what I also thought. I now look in the mirror and see a new me - someone who is not perfect but then I never was perfect before BC. I had a 3.2 cm lump and the nipple removed from my left breast and then of course the surgeon had to go back for more to achieve clear margins. I haven't been swimming yet due to the rest of my treatment so I can't honestly say how I will feel when I can return to the pool but like Robs I have worn strappy tops to try to keep cool during this lovely weather we have been having. I understand your reluctance to return to the pool but I am sure that you will when you feel ready, I found that most people are lucky to give you a passing glance but if they do stare- shame on them. With a little time I hope those feelings of shame/ embarrassment fade along with the scar. Dreamthief told me not to look in the mirror and see a victim but a cancer kicking warrior and that's what we all intend to do. Take care, enjoy spending time with your children. Love and hugs xx",

I know I should be happy that I am near the end of this part of my treatment but I think I am starting to feel anxious and I am finding it difficult to explain to family and friends. Yes I have been lucky with having minimal SE etc. and I am closer to the end but it feels almost like I am losing my security blanket. Does that seem irrational ? I am sat on the couch with my beautiful German Shepherd and although she is a good listener she doesn't have much to say in reply other than trying to give me kisses. I think I am concentrating in getting from one appointment to the next focussing on the task and not looking at the emotional side of treatment but I have had a mini melt-down this week, Monday should have been my mums 74th birthday and I just can't believe I lost her 6. Months ago and on Tuesday my friend had her diagnosis confirmed and has joined the BC club. I think I am worried that I am feeling down and if I do go down I may not get back up, maybe I feel this way because it's the middle of the night and our minds play tricks with us or maybe it's because I am fed-up being \" brave\" as so many friends and family tell me. I am grateful for all their love and support and I don't mean to sound like a moaning Minnie but sometimes I just want to howl at the moon...... Sorry rant over. thank you for reading.

I did have my chemo today but she said if the results were not improved next time she will reduce my Chemo. Just wondered if this is sometimes a normal SE as my Onc said it was nothing for me to worry abouti. This really is a rollercoaster ride as I woke up this morning after having over 7hrs sleep for the first time in weeks feeling fantastic and now well not too sure how I am feeling. Is there anything I could be doing ? Has anyone taken Milk Thistle ? I have been told this can help with Liver Function but obviously not going to try anything without running it past Onc.

I had the same op as you on the 19th of May , the area under my arm was also numb so I think that is quite normal. I think the waiting for the results for me was possibly the hardest as you just want the answers which allows you to move on to the next step . We all find different ways to cope with the wait , for me I went back to work to give me something else to focus on and also started reading books that I have promised myself I would read but never found the time before , when my mum was diagnosed she took up knitting which she said helped her immensely as she had to concentrate on the patterns so hopefully you can find something which helps you.

      "Content": "Hi Penny, sorry to hear you are feeling so low at the moment. Just wanted to share a couple of things that I have found to work for me. Firstly the painful scalp, Dorothee is right I had a Grade 1 and almost instantly the pain disappeared. Secondly the mouth ulcers I used a bicarbonate of soda mouthwash which helped until I asked Onc for Difflam and Gelcllair which someone else had recommended on this site and this session only had one tiny ulcer on the tip of my tongue . The last piece of advice was given to me by my Great Uncle Bill - the more you greet ( cry) the less you pee, based on that piece of logic the night time trips to the loo should be less frequent thus aiding a good nights sleep. I know you are usually always upbeat in all our conversations but please feel free to moan anytime, keep well xx",

      "Content": "Hi Everyone Sorry if this seems like a silly question. I was diagnosed with BC on April 24th and had a WLE on the 19th of May just waiting to find out the next stage of my treatment. I have been advised that Chemo may be next ,followed by Radiotherapy and then drug therapy,my cancer is aggressive as well as er+ I lost my Mum ( lung cancer)4 weeks prior to my diagnosis and as we all know Mum is your best friend who offers love support and advice. Mum handled all her treatment with great courage and strength and I only hope and pray I am half as brave as she was. But losing her means I don't have anyone to ask this question. I am not anxious or worried about the path I am about to take or the effects of the treatment , everyone else around me seems to have these worries and look at me as if I am mad for being calm and matter of fact on what may come next. That's why I am asking the question is this normal? Thank you for reading . Sending love and luck to everyone on this journey. Mandy x",

I think I have a good understanding of what may come and that is possibly why I don't have that many fears but I do have some. I have an appointment with my consultant on Thursday so will find out then re: her2 status , have found good advice on this site about Herceptin . I now follow the rules as at first I couldn't help googling my diagnosis but I scared the c!!p out of myself so made the decision to look on BCC site and this one. It truly is a real community of support, advice , positivity and love. Take care",

      "Content": "Hi Everyone Firstly I would like to apologise for not replying sooner. I have had family staying and I don't seem to have had a minute to myself. Secondly I would like to thank you for your kind words and support. Bongo 56 (Alison) l understand the reason for not tell your Mum as like you I didn't tell my Mum that I had found a lump and was worried as she was fighting her own battle and I didn't want to add to her worries but I believe she has been with me every step of the way so far. I will take your advice and look for a group in my area. Thank you Mb77 ( Marianne) I was sorry to hear about your Dad . You are right about experiencing cancer and the treatment making me more grounded as normally I am one of life's worriers but as you say it home life continues as normal, luckily I don't have to do the school run as my kids are all grown but the dog still needs feeding and the washing etc. thank you GillieB I have got my courage and strength from Mum as I think have you and as I continue on this path I know she will continue to do so. You are right about it being harder for everyone around us I think my sister is finding it more difficult and is stressing over everything no matter how hard I try to reassure her( I am the older sister by a year). Thank you Trudi E I was also very emotional reading your post. I am sorry to hear of your loss and the lack of support from your mum. I was encouraged by your decision to cut off your hair as this is what I think I will also do. I believe every woman is beautiful with or without hair or makeup. Thank you Lastly I apologise for the long post . Sending you all love and luck xx",

I was thinking of you yesterday and hoped that you would be in touch. It really wasn't too bad yesterday I was only on the unit for an hour and forty but I got to chat to the other girls , two of them were on their last treatment and both were kind and encouraging and very supportive. ( it was so quick as I was first on the unit 9 o' clock and am only having EC chemo) please let me know how you are getting on, when is your scan scheduled? Sending you love and luck xx",

The only other thing I experienced was after only 3 hours sleep I was in the wide awake club I am assuming that is an effect of steroids? Thank you so much to everyone who reassured me when I had a bit of a wobble, I was anxious about the effects of chemo so wanted to share my experience in the hope that it could help reassure anyone just about to start their Chemo.

I also thought about ordering a fringe from another site called Heathers Hair, they provide real hair weaves all that they ask is you cover the cost of postage and perhaps if you are able to make a donation. I haven't done this but I have heard of others who have and have been really pleased. At the moment according to the family I am rocking the Sinead O' Connor / Annie Lennox look but I may change my mind when I have no hair. I also have a fab wig but just find it too hot at the moment.have fun shopping. Sending you love and luck xx",
