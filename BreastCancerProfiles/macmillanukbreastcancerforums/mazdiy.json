      "Content": "Hi, does anyone know anything about the above only being available now via hospitals? I have been prescribed it since November but when I collected my last repeat prescription i was told it's no longer available on community prescriptions, only hospital ones. My prescription specifically states the brand so they were able to supply double quanity of 10mg ones instead. I checked with 2 other chemists and they all said the same. Has anyone else had this and found out why? Done something about it? I'm doing okay on it and really don't want to change brands but if I have to is there information available about what the 'fillers' are in other ones so i can try and get one that's the same content? Thanks in hope x",

      "Content": "I had 15 sessions last November at The Spire centre in Bristol and was advised to use Aveeno cream (oncologist also works for NHS hospital in Bath). I slapped it on at least 3 times a day and drank at least 2 litres of water a day and had no problems. I got a little pink and had a slight rash during the last week but Piriton took care of it. Within 2 weeks of finishing, skin was fine and 6 months on, no lasting effects. Good luck with your treatment",

All I know at the moment is I have a 5mm lump that will most likely mean lumpectomy and radiotherapy. I want to tell my daughter when I know more but still thinking through the what to say, where to discuss it and when (initial thought is Friday after school). Any thoughts and advice gratefully received. We have known people with different outcomes which may affect her reaction.",

      "Content": "I went private for my rads and wanted a copy of my pathology report in case it hadn't been sent. I asked one of the BCNs who said she'd post it, I chased and still didn't receive it so went to the hospital and waited until someone printed it out for me. I was frustrated it was a challenge but glad I got it as it confirmed size of lump and that it was estrogen positive enough to make persevering with Tamoxifen worthwhile. My advice would be to do the same, ask and keep asking in person if necessary. It's your report after all. Good luck and cyber hugs",
