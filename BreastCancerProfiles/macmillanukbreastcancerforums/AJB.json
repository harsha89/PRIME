      "Content": "That's a really tricky decision.  I said all along that if the benefit wasn't that great I wouldn't have chemo as I really didn't want to have it, but my chance of reoccurence without it was 50% so it was a no brainer for me.  However, if I had actually been in that position I might have had chemo anyway, as I really wanted to do everything possible to prevent a reocurrence - I don't want to have to go through this sh*t again. I guess you just have to weigh up the potential side effects of the chemo, versus how you would feel if you didn't have chemo and had a reoccurence further down the line.  Of course it's possible to have a reoccurence even with chemo, but if you opt not to have it will you always blame yourself if it happened? Did you have any lymph node involvement?  That would probably sway me towards chemo, but I'm guessing that with only a 5% rating you didn't have any positive nodes.  Are you having any other treatment like Tamoxifen/Herceptin?  Did you have a lumpectomy or mastectomy?  Those are all things that would impact my decision as well. Good luck whatever you decide. Alison",

      "Content": "Hi Libby, I had Myocet and Cyclophosphamide for 3 rounds (similar to FEC) and stopped taking  Dexamethasone after the chemo for the second two doses as I found they gave me blurred vision.  I wasn't suffering at all with sickness anyway, so didn't feel I needed them.  I didn't have any more vision problems after that and didn't feel any worse for not taking them. I then moved on to Taxotere and was advised that the Dexamethasone was more used to prevent allergic reactions to the Tax, and that I should definitely take it.  I did as I was told and haven't had any problems with my vision, so I can only assume it was the combination of steroids and chemo that caused the problems on the first dose. It's definitely worth talking to your Oncologist or chemo nurse to see what they suggest - they may agree to lower the dose rather than you stop taking them completely. Take care Alison",

      "Content": "Hi Rachel, I was diagnosed in March at the tender age of 33.  yes it is uncommon to be diagnosed in your 30s, but no as uncommon as you would like to think. Are you having a sentinel node biopsy as well as lumpectomy?  I had both and it really wasn't too bad.  I found the SNB harder to recover from as your arm movements are restricted for a while, but it wasn't too bad really.  I was pleasantly surprised with the results of my lumpectomy, my boobs were more symmetrical after than before!  And as it was in my larger boob, it was a bit more pert after the op - like you pregnancy had taken it's toll! Has your surgeon explained where your scar will be?  My lump was behind my nipple, so my surgeon managed to cut round the nipple so the scar doesn't really show, apart from a bit of puckering of the skin.  The SNB scar is a very neat line too and is already starting to go white. Sadly I didn't get clear margins from my surgery, and 3 ops later I'm headed for a mastectomy.  The 2nd 2 operations were a breeze compared to the 1st, so even if you don't get clearance (which is quite rare but again not unheard of) try not to worry too much. I hope it all goes well, pop back on and let us know how you are recovering. Take care Alison",

      "Content": "Hi Lorna, I found a lump on my 33rd birthday in February and it turned out to be a grade 3 triple negative tumour. I had a lumpectomy and sentinel node biopsy - thankfully my lymph node was clear but sadly one of my margins wasn't and I've had to have another 2 re-excisions.  I get the results of the latest op this Friday, fingers crossed it is 3rd time lucky. I've been told I will need FEC-T chemo and 15 doses of radiotherapy, can't say I am dealing well with the prospect of the chemotherapy to be honest. As for being young, yes we are young for breast cancer, but it seems to be on the rise in young people from what I can tell.  I personally know 6 other people who have or have had breast cancer in their 20s or 30s.  My surgeon also has quite a few 30 and 40 year olds in her care at the moment. Whereabouts are you based?  I'm also fairly near London, in Kent just inside the M25...... Alison",
