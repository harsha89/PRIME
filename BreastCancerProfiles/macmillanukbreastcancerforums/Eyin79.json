      "Content": "Hello ladies,  I've been reading you since three weeks ago. And now I've just decide to have the courage to share my case with you all. I have had several breast symptoms and a lot of pain during more than one month (stabbing, burning sharp pain). I been taken antibiotics during a week and the gp sent me to the SEU thinking that was a mastitis. After saw me there they discarded mastitis or absces but the pain was getting worst. Then they referred me to the breast clinic and in a week I had my one stop appointment. Ultrasound and biopsy (they said I'm too young for mammogram - 38 years old ).  The radiologist said there was a lot of cysts, and several fibroadenomas. And she said that two of the lumps looked quite abnormal, nothing to be worried but the biopsy was just to confirm 100% that is benign...  I get concern because if is benign, why they do a biopsy? This was last Wednesday (14th of march). How long is gonna take to have my results back and how they gonna contact me? By letter, call, sms? Which is the next step?. I cant think in anything more than the breast clinic calling me saying it's malignant. I need to know... i had a thyroid cancer 4 years ago. 3 years clear already. I'm prepared for anything to come, but the waiting is killing me. And I din't want to worry anybody again.(family and friends) so I don't have anyone to talk regarding my concern and scare. What you reckon? Should I be worried?  Thanks for the reading. I love to read everything you share and I feel less alone since I found this chat.   Many kisses and lots of hugs to all of you there!  Eyin79 Ps. Apologies for my english... I live here in UK (Oxfordshire) but I'm from Madrid. Just 3 years living here. ",

      "Content": "Thanks Leolady! Sorry for the time without answer... has been a hard week and really don't feel like to doing anything but crying . I had been even drinking wine last friday alone at home! Never did it before...   Still waiting for the results... I've just reached a point in which I don't really mind even the outcome. But I just want to know!!!  I'm really desperate. And I feel sincerely alone. Everybody asking me when the results are gonna be back (closest friends and my mum) and I can't handle this. All of them saying that is not cancer because is painfull and \"everybody knows that \" And if is taking so long to hear from the hospital is because is nothing serious. I would like to be that sure !   I feel as if they underestimate my pain or if I can even feel entitled to be worry. Am I overreacting? It's been 12 days since my biopsy and no one tell me anything... I have my life put on hold and I can barely breath... feeling drowning... All the best for all of you. ❤️ Sorry for bother you ",
