      "Content": "Thanks Ruby Rose  and by coincidenec today after waiting 7 months for counselling my name has finally appeared near the top of the list  and have an appointment locally next week as someone had cancelled so I wonder how that will go.     Thanks for the info on Breast Cancer Care helpline, not heard of them (sooo much happened and misty fog moments with the SE's) so that is another place to try.   The Macmillan centre and Maggies Centre are in my region but its too far away to get too and from on public transport and I have mobility problems as well as on Aspergers women over 55 spectrum which added to all the c stuff well kind of makes it more challenging putting it mildly but it was a kindly meant suggestion  I sometimes help my hubby (who is still getting his head around the diagnosis) with his mega jigsaws and now the days are getting longer its easier on the eyes.    He gets his from a hospice charity shop and I get books from them too. Meanwhile hope that mammo goes ok and the results are what you want to heart. Just phoned my son who lives and works in Scotland, he is ok so that gives me peace of mind, time for a cuppa now.",

I read somewhere that it might also be due to lack of zinc or iron in post menopause women but got confused with the volume of info so  would be grateful if anyone can give me tips how to ease them please if you have experienced similar.  Am on soft food and nothing spicy or too hot any more.  Thank you.    ",

I am, how they say, mega curvy.    Betty still itches and appears like jaffa orange peel from time to time plus the scar hurts but the bras had to come off after half an hour they dug in so much, so will look online especially the crop style ones as 'Brenda' needs her uplift too!!     Hope you all continue to do OK on your respective long healing bc journeys.  Gentle hugs.     ",

I felt and have not shared this with anyone , wracked with guilt at times that mine was 'only' small and I survived thanks to the surgical and RT team with that amazing spaceage technology machine which I gave a nickname to in order to get comfortable through that part.  Plus bleepy determination that this newly retired was not going to let it beat me so did some complementary therapies to keep stress and anxiety levels under control and I shed more tears for the ladies who were diagnosed with stages 3 and 4.  Like you say its hell like a rollercoaster ride and we have to strap in extra  tight!!    I hope you get to see your bc team this month and its going to go ok lots of luck from me.  ",
