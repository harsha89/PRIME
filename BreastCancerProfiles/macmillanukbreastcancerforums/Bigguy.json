      "Content": "Hi, it\u2019s really good that you\u2019ve found this site. Everyone is so helpful. I had a lumpectomy & breast reduction almost 3 weeks ago. It looks as though everyone\u2019s experience is different. I stayed in hospital for 2 nights as had an issue post-op. I left hospital with 2 drains that were pesky & uncomfortable. I went back to the hospital to get them removed 2 days after discharge home. I managed the pain with paracetamol & ibuprofen and very occassional oral morphine. The dressings were removed 10 days after op. I\u2019ve done physio as instructed and noticing it\u2019s getting easier all the time. I\u2019ve been out most days since op, not easy and sometimes I really have to dig deep!!   I\u2019m usually a very fit & active 48 year old and am looking forward to gymming etc again but not going to rush it. From what I\u2019ve read on here, some folks have gone back to work 3-4 weeks after surgery. I work for NHS and am very hands on!! My manager doesn\u2019t want  me back until after radiotherapy.  Try to do some really lovely things this week before before your op. XxX",

I managed to find ice lollies in Iceland!! Who knew??  Has anyone experienced dizziness on Fec?? I realise it\u2019s probably another side effect but wondered how long it might last?? The nausea subsided on day 5 to make way for sore throat and flu symptoms, now the tiredness has gone to be replaced with dizziness. I actuallty felt so fed up with it this afternoon I cried. It\u2019s worse on sitting or standing and a bit easier if I lie down on my side. xXx",

Try to make sure she\u2019s drinking plenty (2-3 litres a day), eating if she can and getting out for short walks daily if possible.

I think a lot of us were told pre-surgery that lymph nodes weren\u2019t involved and there would probably be no need for chemo only to be told that we do need it as cells found. Head melt or what ?? It is impossible to stay positive all the time, especially around appointments and results. You\u2019re worried, recovering from surgery and most probably shell shocked by it all. My children are 20 & 16 and can\u2019t imagine what it must be like to have much younger children when you\u2019re going through this.  As others will no doubt tell you, chemo is no picnic but it is completely doable. There is a monthly chemotherapy thread that\u2019s full of top tips, hints and support. Have a look at the other threads to when you feel up to it. Hope this helps. xXx",

I\u2019m glad I had the reduction as it means no reconstruction is necessary. The surgeon took 5 lymph nodes from the same incision as the limpectomy & reduction; I was expecting another incision for lymph nodes so I was relieved.  I wouldn\u2019t say I love the my new boobs because of the circumstances but I\u2019m reasonably happy with the shape. I think it\u2019s a bit unfair the surgeon asking you to choose which incision which should be made - they\u2019re the experts!!  xXx",

This is not a race, it\u2019s a journey that we will all complete in a different way taking a different route but getting to the same place in the end. The pain is still getting me down to as is lack of sleep BUT we\u2019re in it together and here for each other. I\u2019ve worked out if I just potter about in the house and rest much more I\u2019m virtually pain free but fed up & down. If I do a bit more & go out & about I\u2019m sore but more positive.  It\u2019s more frustrating because we\u2019re all different we all heal (physically and emotionally) and there is no set recovery time; unlike what drs tell us eh????? So, Fran, chin up and get yourself well in your time in your way.  Love xXx",

The medicine reduced our son\u2019s fracture rate from a broken leg/arm every 12 weeks to every 12 months. It also helps his bone pain a lot. So, our family, the drugs have been amazing. However, there are other parents that I know well are against them.  We have experience of i/v and oral bisphosphanates. He\u2019s been taking oral medicine on and off for 5 years. Sunday is \u201ctablet day\u201d; take tablet and drink 1 pint of water whilst on xbox/ipad then carry on day. He has had no problems or side effects apart from a broken neck of femur 4 years ago which was probably linked to the medicaton.  So, bit of a long one but it might help.",

We are a friendly bunch who wobble, rant, cry and laugh together.  Let me say first that what you are doing to help your sister and family is brilliant. It sounds like you\u2019re already being an amazing support to her. I see from your post that you\u2019ve been doing some research, please stick to this site, Cancer Research or NHS as a lot of websites are out of date and can be misleading. My initial diagnosis was \u201ccurable\u201d then \u201ctreatable\u201d to and it completely knocked me sideways. You go from, this can be cured and kind of forgotten to bleep, I\u2019ve got to live with this and it might come back into life again without an invite!! However, by being on this site, I\u2019ve realised that folk can get on with life after diagnosis, surgery, chemo, etc, it\u2019s just a case of getting used to a new normal. That is a long way down the line for you & your family. Right now, all you have to do is get through each day with and for your sister surronding her with love and support. Keep in touch with us all. xXx",

My son had iv Pam for 7 years and has had oral Risedronate for almost 5 years with no ill effects. He has the medicine for the treatment of Brittle Bone Disease. I have got 2 friends, however, who strongly regret letting thier child have the drugs as thier bones have gone over dense and, therefore, more brittle. We have always been told by dentists that jaw necrosis from bisphosphanates is extremely rare but if my son needs any dental work it would have to be done in Sheffield at the dental hospital. Hope this helps.",

My T s/e start on day 4 but everyone\u2019s different aren\u2019t they?? I think the first 2-3 days are usually ok because of the steroids giving you an artificial high. xXx",
