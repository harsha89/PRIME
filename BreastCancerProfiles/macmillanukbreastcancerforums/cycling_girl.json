Until your appointment, be nice to yourself and do things that make you happy with your family. Good luck and please come back and let us know how you get on.

      "Content": "Hiya.  Radiotherapy is mostly the treatment offered when you have a lumpectomy and/or cancer cells are in the lymph nodes.  You dont always need radiotherapy if you have a mastectomy as the whole breast has been removed and radiotherapy is a more localised treatement.   If you have a mastectomy and are likely to need radiotheraphy then an immediate reconstruction is not advised as this can interfere with the treatment.  I had a masecttomy with immediate reconstruction and no cancer present in my lymph nodes so my post surgery treatement is chemotherapy.  I might not have needed chemotherapy but as I an triple negative, I can't have hormonal treatement such as tamoxifen.  It is a lot to learn in a short space of time when you are still trying to come to terms with it all.  What I tend to do is a bit of reading before my appoinment and then write some questions down.  If you take someone with you, you can ask them to remind you if you forget to ask.  Good luck.",

The affects of chemo are cumaltive so you can naturally expect to feel a little worse as it goes on. That being said, its doable, just expect that your plans might go AWOL - the hardest bit for me. I had my last T on 12 August and still have side effects of muscle pain in my legs and arms and my toenail fell off yesterday. I have also had fluid retention and swelling on my face, wrists and ankles.

      "Content": "Hi Clare and Sam Clare, if the tumour(s) are large then chemotherapy is generally given before surgery to try and shrink them and minimise surgery. In some cases tumours have disappeared altogether. Sam,the thing about the node removal is that its an awkward place in your armpit. If you can, it will help your recovery quicker if you can rest with your arm away from your body as your arm will irritate your wound. Oh and do the exercises. I was diagnosed with Stage 1 Grade 3 triple negative breast cancer in February, i have had a mastectomy and reconstruction and sentinel node removal. I'm not having radiotherapy and had my last chemo on 12 August (I had 6). I can honestly say it wasn't as bad as i thought and it went really quickly. I remember how you felt Sam with it being in your head and it will stay like that. Its weird but its a bit like when you are pregnant and you can't stop thinking and talking about it. The good news is, you have been diagnosed and are being treated which means you are on the road to recovery. Keep well and don't be afraid to ask any questions. There are also a lot of publications on this site which are worth a read. The best advice I can give you is while you feel well, keep busy. And when you feel unwell accept that you need to rest, sometimes this won't be what you want or won't be convenient, but you just got to go with it. Best wishes. Nadjie",

Yes she knew I was TNBC, and it was a bit of passing comment.  I'm not stressed out about it, and will as Helen suggests talk my GP into period testing as appropriate.  I was a little concerned that they gave me wrong information about smear tests as apparently I do have a cervix !!!!!  But hopefully those lovely doses of Docetaxel killed off anything nasty around my body.   Thanks for the nudge about posting in the post treatment thread.  You are right I'm a bit overdue and need to wake everyone up.  I've been in touch with Amanda - Champamunid Chick, she's doing great and doing the Women V Cancer Ride the Night with me in May.

If you are considering an immediate reconstruction,  I had a mastectomy on 21 March with expander implant reconstruction and my experience has been a positive one.  The recovery was fine and if I had to have another one I would be ok about it.  After the initial hospital recovery, you will need to do exercises for several weeks and no heavy lifting.  This is critical to your full recovery.  Some of the other ladies on her can give you your their view on other reconstructions.

The soreness will go.  If you can rub in some coconut oil into your scalp (you can get from Holland and Barrett or Health Shops).  Its not expensive and last for ages, I bought a huge tub from Costco for a tenner. I bought a wig, but I have hardly worn it, as I find it a little hot.  I have bought a few cheap hats from Peacocks and Matalan for £6 each and they are great and look great too.  You might be able to wear them in combination with the remainder of your hair.  I've also got some sleep caps which I put bandanas around to dress them up (bought them cheap from Claire's accessories). Its weird as having short hair forever I've never worn these feminine things and I am now enjoying having a different style.  I'll try and post some pics that I hope will make you smile. I've also booked onto the Headstrong workshop on 6 July at Southend Hospital where they show you what to do with the headwear thing.  Here is the link and maybe you might like to book on at your nearest one. https://www.breastcancercare.org.uk/breast-cancer-services/talks-courses-local-support/hair-loss-advisory-service/headstrong-locations#london Hope you feel better today.

We're all going through (or supporting someone who is going through) chemo at the moment so you will get some comfort and answers to your questions.  It must have been a shock your diagnosis and then to have to move into fertility treatment, I hope that is going well. So, FEC-T is the most common chemo and is normally 6 treatments of 3 x FEC and then 3 X T at 3 week intervals.  I have just had no 3 FEC and you can find some useful info about chemo at the blogs we recently put together here. http://community.macmillan.org.uk/blogs/b/community_news/archive/2015/04/10/what-should-i-bring-to-my-chemo-part-one.aspx   http://community.macmillan.org.uk/blogs/b/community_news/archive/2015/04/13/what-should-i-bring-to-my-chemo-part-two.aspx You'll also find some factsheets on here for FEC and T and the side affects.  Everyone is different and you'll probably be able to learn from chemo no ! and apply it it no 2.  For me it was the nausea and metal taste so plenty of water and finding a food you can eat (normally spicey or strong flavour).  I would also advise you to start thinking about your hair, there are ladies on here who went for the cold cap which you have at the same time as chemo to help preserve your hair.  Either way you will need some headgear, scarves, bandanas, hats etc.  I've bought some cheap hats from Peacocks and Matalan for £6 and some bandanas from Claire's accessories.  I've found having a selection and feeling god about my appearance has helped me deal with the chemo.

      "Content": "Hi Everyone - loving the long posts. Happy Birthday Mags, I hope you had a chance to relax and enjoy your special day. Trish, great news on your bloods, good luck tomorrow. FEC No 3 today and I feel so so, I stayed a bit longer at the hospital and took my antisickness before today, but definitely got a bit of nausea and stomach ache going on, but no nasty taste or other problems a the moment. Re: all the other discussion.  Really admire those that have done the cold cap, i'm definitely a bit of a baby so didn't even try it.  now i have the problem of a short wig that is already hot  so have bought some hats and signed up for the headstrong workshop as i'm not very good at the scart thing.  Here's the link in case you thinkg it might be useful  for you. http://www.breastcancercare.org.uk/breast-cancer-services/talks-courses-local-support/hair-loss-advisory-service/headstrong-locations Advice I have had is no painkillers without consultation with BCN or hospital team. It seems like we're a bit split on experience of FEC vs T.   My view is FEC has definitely not been as bad as I thought so lets see what T brings.  I asked today how long my T ttreatment will take on 1 July and they said 1 hour but that might be down to the Port, more on that below.  I wonder also if whatever treatment you have the second half is worse because you have had more treatments and a cumulative build up of chemo drugs. Like Amanda I have a port, its called a Bard Power Port - will post a link when I find one - i'll try and post a picture too.  Like Amanda said its inserted beneath the chest skin and has a line down towards your heart.  I will give you my view on it, and it is only my view. The great advantage is that your drugs - and everything intraveneous can be given through it, are much much quicker, my FEC today took 10 minutes.  They can also take your bloods from it.  It is more expensive than other line methods so may not be offered by all hospitals but it is worth asking about. after you've done a little research and can convience your BC team that its better for you (and them :-)).  The cons, the first couple of weeks i kept feeling a dragging pain when i moved (but lets face it i don't sit still) this was my lack of understanding about recovery after insertion and that it was inserted on my good side (ie it couldn't go on my right side where i had had my mastectomy) and my left side had been getttng more movement.  Now I've got used to it and am more aware of movemens that give me a little twinge like big upward stretches of my left arm.  Oh and i couldnt forget the other hair discussion.  So hair all gone, eyebrows gone, eyelashes still in intact, didnt have much hair on arms and legs.  look away George - hair on foofoo partially gone. Keep well everyone. Nadjie",

So when you had that on it takes around an hour. The T is not administered in a syringe, it is in a drip bag so I reckon in total it will be about 2 hours. I have no idea what my doses are, but my Onco did say I was on the highest dose when I asked him as I had vascular invasion and of course am Triple Neg and not having radiotherapy. I have no idea what Paclitaxel is, sorry. Keep well. Nadjie",

      "Content": "Morning ! Karin, I can't remember what I asked either, but I do remember that you answered it :-) Hev, glad you've made a decision about your reconstruction and I hope it all goes well for you. Good advice too about taking your time about making the decision.  The only thing I will say on balance is that if you leave it too long you might not do it, and maybe that's the right thing too. Because I had surgery first I did have to make a fairly quick decision on my reconstruction.  Having an immediate one was easy for me, my Mum had a mastectomy in 2007 at the age of 65 and has never got round to a reconstruction. I have fat on my stomach and back and even though I'm brave on certain things, I was a bit of a scaredy cat on that reconstruction so chose the implant with expander.  I have to say I am really pleased with it.  The recovery and pain was doable and when I bought my new bras the new boob fitted perfectly into them.  I think when my chemo is over I might have to have the implant replaced. On the cycling, I have to say its really helped me stay positive.  When I'm riding through the countryside I forget all my worries, and because its mostly my legs doing the work, I've been able to get back into it.  I do get bad days and I do know I should probably be resting more, but I've always had ants in my pants and I recognise that if my body says stop I will (got hubby on standby to pick me up if I have to bail out of the bike ride on Saturday :-)). I echo what Hev has been saying about the time it takes to go through this journey.  When I was diagnosed in February it seemed like a life time and now Chemo No 4/6 is tomorrow.  I'll also be joined at my session by a man who will be on his last Herceptin so its the end of his treatment.  I don't know what his cancer is, but he's had surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy and Herceptin, am going to take a little cake down to celebrate.  One thing I will say is the best therapy for my cancer journey has been here.  As they used to say on the BT adverts - \"its good to talk\". Have a great day. Nadjie",

For your mouth and taste.  Spicy food when you can't taste anything or stronger tasting food might help you enjoy your food by it tasting better.  When I had my favourite fish and chips on friday it was like eating cardboard so I've ramped up the flavours.  You can rinse your mouth with salt walter or bicarbonate of soda mixed in a litttle water as these both help too.  Plus using non-alccohol mouthwashes.   The nails is a problem.  Mine are splitting and flaking terrible.  I just keep putting on vitamin e oil at night (very cheap to buy from superdrug) and making sure they are painted with nail hardener.  I know they are going to get worse when I have my first T on 1 July. Wish you a great day.  I just had a mammoth sleep and am going to attempt some light housework and take it easy today. Nadjie",

      "Content": "I agree Amanda There are definitely some \"friends\" that are no longer \"friends\" thats for sure and I have been astounded with some behaviour and lack of sensitivity and support. Regarding my new boob. Well my reconstruction happened real quick, I was diagnosed on 27 Feb and had it on 21 March so didn't have much time to think about it. What I can say, is that I never imagined today that I would say, it feels like a natural part of my body. It doesn't feel like it doesn't belong or any different to my other breast (except that its a big perkier !!!). Of course when you first get it, you are very aware and conscious of it, but now I don't even think about it. In a couple of months I'll have the option to have a nipple tattooed and I'm thinking about having a smiley face instead so it reminds me of what I been through and how lucky I am. Any other suggestions of alternatives to nipple tattoo very welcome !!!! I've said this before and sorry to lecture you Hev and everyone else yet to have reconstruction. It is really really important to do the exercises. Even when you don't want to and feel a bit stiff and sore. Because I was a bit crazy about doing the WomenVsCancer bike ride I was religous about them and the result speak for themselves. I am 100% back to normal re mobility, movement etc and I have no numbness in my arm whatsoever. Its a great feeling. Best wishes to you all. Nadjie",

      "Content": "Hi Chrissie I should have said, I've had hysterectomy and two C-sections so my stomach was no good and it would have all had to come from my back. When you look at my implant when I'm naked, its definitely perkier than my other boob, but I am 55 so to be expected.  I do know you get a more natural shape in keeping with your other boob with the LD back flap and the feel of the boob is more natural if they use all of your tissue for the breast reconstruction.  When I touch my implant in my bra, it feels the same.  When I touch it naked it is different because it's not tissue.  That wasn't important to me because that breast has no feeling so my hubby wasn't going to be touching it in intimate moments anyway and I'm fine with how it feels to touch. If  you send me a private message, I would be happy to send you some photos. It was pretty much Hobson's choice for me, but it seems like you may have two choices.  In which case, I would do a little table with a list of what you would like the outcome to be and then check this against the two different reconstructions with pros/cons based on what you know and you can use this as a review with your consultant.

      "Content": "Hi Bubbleblower.  welcome to the group.  I was diagnosed on 27 Feb so a relative newby.  I 've had a mastectomy and reconstruction and wiaiting to start chemo.  `It is a shock and most people view having cancer as a bad thing.  The good news is that you will now be treated to recovery.  Do you know the  the stage and grade of your cancer  ?  If not you must ask at your appointment.  Have a look on the macmillian site and get some information on what questions to ask.  You will also want to explore treatment options, so being  a little better informed will help you ask the right questions.  Tell your family that you are going to be fine and believe that to yourself.  Good luck.",

      "Content": "Chemo Survival Kit \u2013 Version 3 \u2013 8 April 2015 - please read and contribute   Hi Some suggestions below from members of things that work and help during chemo.  I thought it could be helpful to repost both as a separate discussion and in the current month\u2019s Chemo club.  Please can you continue to add your comments and suggestions also and I will update.  Recommendations on use of these items, brands/where to buy etc would be great too.  Thank you and good luck J  Digital thermometer (Lloyds pharmacy do a good one for £11) A good chlorhexidine mouthwash.  Mouthwash at least twice a day (eg Corsodyl non-alcoholic) Microwaveable Lavender wheat wrap for arm/vein aches. Manuka Honey (Aldi or H&B often do 2for1).  If you are on Doxcetaxel / Taxotere - get the Manuka 24+ from H&B if you can afford it as the higher the number the more pure it is. Soft toothbrush - Boots do a good baby electric toothbrush Ginger Nut Biscuits and/or Ginger Beer to help kick start taste buds. Pineapple cooled in the fridge to help with unpleasantness and stickiness inside mouth. Anti Nausea medication \u2013 really important to take this before you need it and consistently to keep on top of it.  Try to get medication prescribed before chemo starts. Avoid dairy products the day of treatment and a whilst you feel nauseous -including milk substitutes like almond, rice milk etc. But eat what you feel like, when you feel like it and don\u2019t feel guilty as there will be so many things you won\u2019t be able to eat either because they are on the list to avoid or you go off them Mouth Ulcers - make your diet as Alkaline as possible, avoid acid foods such as Oranges, blueberries, cranberries....instead eat melon, kiwi fruit, mango, apples....there are loads if good websites outlining acid/alkaline foods. Rinse out your mouth after meals with bicarbonate of soda.....change to a soft toothbrush, you can gently floss your teeth but don't use dental brushes. Get a gentle PH balanced soap and moisturiser for you skin - moisturise frequently....use rubber gloves for any \"wet\" work...don't have too many hot showers....drys your skin more.  Also plastic gloves for all cooking to protect hands, plus loads of hand cream. Clarins is good, although pricey lasts for ages and moisturises hands well Rest as you need to but exercise as frequently as possible - you might feel knackered but exercise will help battle the fatigue. Don't become a hermit - yes avoid circumstances/people you know to be ill.......but try to live as normal a life as possible.....it helps fight off any emotional side effects. Cold Sore Cream 100% organic almond oil for head when bald.  keeps hydrated and encourages hair growth when chemo finishes. Gingins from H&B. Ginger sweets, quite chewy but you can also suck them. Good for when saline or chemo going through you to take away initial weird taste. Ginger beer is very useful as an alcohol substitute... It didn't taste of metal and looked like a proper drink! Nail strengthener/varnish.  Nail oil to keep nails as health as possible - avocado oil quite cheap and lasts.  Dark nail polish is recommended to protect your nails during chemo. under eye concealer A place on a look good feel better course- apply ASAP as it can take a while to get on one Huggies-fragrance free baby wipes - very useful for all sorts of things!!! Keep a Diary.... Not only for appointments \u2013 With enough page space to write in how you feel on a daily basis and to record temperature readings. Keep important telephone nos. and notes handy that family, friends, helpers can access if  you\u2019re feeling poorly. Keep a clothes kit ready for emergency dash to hospital. Moist toilet wipes - Tesco sensitive or Andrex - really helpful if you are very dry. 'Emend' tablets off Doctor are brilliant for sickness 'Rasberry Mucilage' off Doctor to ease throat problems Caphasol or Difflam off Doctor for Mouth rinsing and both clean mouth of any germs. Lockets for throat. Plastic cutlery as meal can taste awful. Wigs on Amazon under \u201cMistresses\u201d so natural looking. Sleeping caps to keep your head warm at night. Phone \u201cHeadstrong\u201d for ideas on scarves",

The good news is that the all fade from the second week of treatment. Good luck, it will all be over soon enough :-) Nadjie",

These will help your recovery enormously.  Good luck. ",

Try if you can to have a nice couple of days enjoying the weather, Sunday and Tuesday will come soon enough. Here's the link to the July chemo club, maybe drop in before you start in August and do let us know how you get on Tuesday. Good luck.
