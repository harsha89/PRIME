    "Content": "Hi Julia I have ovarian cancer and am BRCA1 positive. My Mother died of breast cancer but was not tested for the mutation so we will never know her status.  I am on a maintenance drug to prevent cancer returning.    My cousins and my sister were tested for BRCA and all came out negative.  My brother is still undecided what to do and has not told his wife or children about the gene.   I have three children and after many months of discussion, all three decided to be tested. The results came in last week. All three have inherited the mutation.  The two girls agree that while it's not the result we all hoped for, at least they know, and can prepare for the future. At the moment, one says they will have full preventative surgery and the other says they won't. They have the luxury of time and to come to the right decision for them.  It is a life changing decision to be tested but it can also be a life saving decision.  I wish you all the best and look forward to reading your future posts and what you decide to do.  With love  Mhairi x",
