      "Content": "Hi so sorry to hear that it's back i'm 47 and had been 10 years clear when it decided to come back in March this year in a couple of my lymph nodes in my chest.  The shock is awful and it will take time to get your head round it.  There are lots of different treatments out there I have been put on Letrozole because my cancer feeds on the oestrogen in my body and I've been through the menopause, and i'm doing okay.   When i was diagnosed my consultant said it could'nt be cured but it could be managed and i'm going to fight this all the way.  Hope this helps a bit keep strong xx",
