      "Content": "Thanks for your replies, it's reassuring to know it sounds as though all is normal and as it should be for this stage post-op...Mary, they never said anything about not lifting my arms so I haven't been that careful...I am seeing my surgeon next week so it will be interesting to see what he thinks about them and the lumpy bit... Thanks again for the reassuring comments x",

      "Content": "A quick question for any of you ladies out there who have had reconstruction done using expander implants...I had mine done (bilateral) 4 weeks ago and I am still sore, it feels like my whole chest area is bruised and tight...is this normal? Also they used strattice for support in the reconstruction and I was wondering for anyone else that has had this whether you can feel it? My right side seems fine but my left breast I can feel a lump underneath and to the side as though something has moved (not the ports as I can feel them below the breast) and the implant moves a bit if I move quickly...has anyone else experienced this? Any advice would be appreciated. Many thanks x",
