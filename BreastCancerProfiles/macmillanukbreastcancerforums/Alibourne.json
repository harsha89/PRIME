      "Content": "Hi Scarlettem, When I started my injections I felt very tired and fluey, I checked and they said 'oh yes that's how we'd expect you to feel.  I then chatted to my oncologist and she said have injections before you go to bed, and have paracetamol one hour before - seems to have helped .. however, when I checked this time (I keep asking them questions!) they said it might be a reaction to my stopping my anti sickness steroids! who knows - but do what's best for you - injecting yourself saves lots fo time waiting in for district nurses .. Hope it all goes well for you, Alison",

      "Content": "Hi - so sorry to hear your trauma.  My hair started coming out 10 days after my first chemo..:( I'd been ultra prepared and had already had the trauma of buying a wig - I quite liked it. But once my hair started coming out I got my hairdresser top shave it off ... we had some fun - I ended up at one point with a Mohican! Never had one before and never likely to have one again so I have photographic evidence of me with a Mohican - tried to make it a fun experience. But once I'd worn my wig once or twice it just didn't feel right -  I didn't feel like myself and it felt like I had a cushion on my head! so I've done the natural look - using beanie's and woolly hats in the winter but I also go natural - been out to restaurants etc and family gatherings .. anywhere really with just my bald head and a bit of bristle which seems to have stayed (not sure how!) .. and it is OK. Try to go to one of the 'look good feel better' workshops - in hospitals, ask your onc nurse - helps with make up and how to pencil in eyebrows etc once they have gone. meeting other sin similar situation,  really uplifting. I'm now used to being bald and worry about it growing back and having a skinhead! all the best and I hope you can find some comfort in us all going through it together - so many different options to take -  take care,  Alison ",

It has come back grey & curly - never had naturally curly hair before - had perms in the 80's! - it is a whole new thing for me - has this happened to anyone else? Is it likely to stay curly for long? Any musings would be great - thanks Ali ",
