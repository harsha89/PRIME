    "Content": "Hi ladies , I have just joined the group As my my best friend has just been diagnosed with ovarian cancer stage 3b, not in the demographic what\u2019s so ever, such a shock for everyone... the reason I am here tonight is I have been experiencing sharp shooting pains in my right breast, it\u2019s been waking me up when I lie on my back, but goes when I\u2019m on my side , never experienced anything like it, sharp shooting pains and a burning feeling.. I had a mammogram last autumn which was clear but after my friend has been diagnosed totally unexpected I am rather concerned as I\u2019ve never experienced this , not the same pain as pms at all.. also the problem is I have very lumpy boobs , always have and a family history of benign cysts so no idea what I\u2019d be looking for - any ideas? Xx doesn\u2019t feel right to me though but not sure if it\u2019s paranoia because of my friend xxÂ ",
