    "Content": "My advice is Google info as much as you can. If you're intelligent enough you can see the bad from the good. If I and my daughter had done this my wife would still be alive. Some doctors haven't got a clue. Others don't care. Some constrained by budgets. Diagnose your symptoms yourself then if you're Â fobbed off start harrasing people until you get the treatment you deserve. Good luck.",
