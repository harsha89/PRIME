I had lumpectomy and 2 lymph nodes removed, my breast surgery was really painless and lymph nodes feel bruised and sore, its hard to lift your arm to start but with excersie things get easier over the first week, I only took paracetamol and that seemed to work, I had 6 rounds of chemo and  20 radiotherapy, every1s treatment is different . I nearly 9 months out of chemo now and back at work full time, I have the down days still when I feel abit tired but that's down to tamoxifen which I hate with a passion I hope everything goes well for you and your lymph nodes will be clear, the ladies on here are invaluable keep chatting to every1 theirs always somebody to help with any worry you have.

      "Content": "HEY 58petals welcome to the group, all your worries are perfectly normal and we all went through this process early on because its hard to take everything in, you don't mention chemo so I presume you've escaped this being being stage 1 and caught early, if they thought of spread then I would say they would give you chemo aswell to clear up. I was caught at an early stage 1 but I had aggressive grade 3 and had too have chemo and rads, I finished all my treatment in Jan and rads April,the ladies on here are truly inspirational and dreamthief off course any worries will be addressed by someone throughout your journey, I had the all clear last month and I truly can't beleive it but its good to be in the neddy club ( no evidence of disease) and you too will be joining sooner than you think, best wishes hun.
