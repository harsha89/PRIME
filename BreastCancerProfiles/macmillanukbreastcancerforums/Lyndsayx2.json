    "Content": "When I found a lump in my breast the GP thought it was a cyst. My Choose and Book appointment was 5 weeks from when I saw the GP. For the 1st week I phoned them every day to ask if there had been a cancellation. I too was really worried so my husband suggested we went private. I got the telephone number for a private hospital from my GP and they gave me a referral letter. I phoned the private hospital and got an appoinment within 2 days. It was the same consultant who ran the clinic at the NHS hospital. I was told that I would have to pay for the initial consulation (as I had no insurance) which was £180 but any further treatments could be done back at the NHS hospital with no charge. I had the consult and an ultrasound in the end and in total cost about £300. I needed a biopsy as well and was told this would be £1500, but they would see me the following day at the NHS where it would cost me nothing. I had the biopsy done on the NHS and I in effect jumped the queue. I'm glad I did as it turned out I did have breast cancer (quite a shock as I'm 32) and I had the lump removed the day when I should have had my original appointment. I was very lucky that I was able to pay for the private consult as this really did jump the queue so I would recommend this if you can afford it - otherwise keep ringing them everyday for a cancellation as you might be lucky ( I cancelled my original appointment so it does happen!) Good luck and I hope it all works out well for you",
