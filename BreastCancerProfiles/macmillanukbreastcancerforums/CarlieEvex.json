      "Content": "Hi Ann, had a bit of a meltdown yesterday but feeling better today. Hope you're feeling ok.  Before I opted for the mastectomy, the Dr said he was going to perform a lumpectomy & then radiotherapy, so I'm gathering this is why I'm not having immediate reconstruction. I have a tumour as well as the calcification. Holding onto the hope that the first time they looked at the lymphs they looked normal & second time they looked they said they were very slightly thickened, which they said may have been due to the biopsy the week before.  I am slightly worried how I'll look after as I'm like you a D-E cup, so an ample pair And same, hate the loss of control also, I am rarely ever poorly, so this has hit me for six!  Please let me know how you get on & good luck.  Carlie xx  ",

      "Content": "Hi Forestsidelady, I glad to hear of your positive experience & this makes me feel so much better. I am more scared of being put to sleep as I don't like the thought of having no control over it, silly I know.  Your positive attitude is refreshing & has lifted my spirits. Everyone is so lovely on here, as sometimes speaking to family isn't the same. Always easier to speak with people in the same boat. So thank you.  Carlie xx",

      "Content": "Hi Ann, I have been ok, how are you feeling?  The nurse is coming to my home tomorrow to discuss my feelings etc & talk about the op next week. I haven't really had much info, I found out only 2 weeks ago that I had bc & the week after was the info gathering. Had a brief meeting with the Dr last Thursday where he told me there was a large area of calcification - biopsy was inconclusive which is why I opted for the mastectomy. I have waited 4 months to be seen, my GP, put on the referral form 'not suspected cancer' which put me to the back of the queue. Can't believe any GP would not take a lump seriously which makes me angry.  I'm glad to hear the good news that your bone density is above average, these bits of positive news bring some hope in this rubbish situation we're in xx What is the before photo shoot? Is it something you would arrange yourself?  Oh yes the waiting makes me so anxious & on edge & I have to mentally prepare for the news!  I know, I want it over with now too although I am scared stiff. How are you feeling about it all?  Carlie xxx",

      "Content": "Hiya, thanks for your reply much appreciated.  Oh yes, the waiting is driving me crazy. I opted for the mastectomy because apart from the lump, there is a large area of calcification which the biopsy came back with an inconclusive result. I was offered the lumpectomy but I feel the mastectomy is the right thing to do for me.  It is nice to just be able to chat with people who are also going through a similar situation. Xx",

      "Content": "Hi Tilly, how did you find it, the discomfort after etc? I'm not afraid of losing my breast just afraid of the being put to sleep, silly I know but it makes me feel anxious. I have been told that if I want reconstruction it won't be done until 6-12 months after, not sure why that is. Waiting on lymph node results still also, it's all just such a tough & scary time isn't it. I am trying to stay as positive as I can for my children.  Thanks for the reply Tilly xx",

      "Content": "Hi Ann, oh I didn't get asked about the before & after photo shoot, feel left out lol jokes!  Ahhh I'll be doing mine on the weekend, looking for a mastectomy bra which are all horrendous but needs must! They've told me the same as you though that I will need my other breast made smaller to match the new one...when the time comes of course.  Had the bcn come to see me today & had a little positive news that my lymph node biopsy was negative but they'll still do the sn biopsy to be 100%. Also that I've got grade 2, ductal + DCIS, ER+ & HER2-. I feel slightly more at ease knowing more, whereas yesterday I knew nothing. So I'm in Monday for a few things, then all systems go Tuesday! Will be thinking of you Wednesday & sending you positive vibes xx Carlie xx     ",

Of course we'll be fine, positive thoughts all round, chatting on here helps me a lot. Haha, you just get your perky breasts before me, I'm on a wait...jealous lol!!  Take care, Carlie xx",

One minute I'm positive, the next I am angry. I am also still waiting on the results from my lymph node biopsy, which I will receive Thursday.  Fab that you've booked your holiday, something to look forward to for next year & to keep you positive xx",
