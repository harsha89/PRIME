    "Content": "Hi to everyone here - I was just surfing about looking for info to help me understand a little more what's happening to my mum who has just had her mastectomy and lymph node sampling done on Tuesday. She's 64 and had a lump that was difficult to detect in the milk duct behind the nipple so unfortunately that meant removing the breast. She hasn't opted for reconstruction but that is something she could get further down the line. She doesn't seem to want it though. I wish she was one to use the internet and she could have read your stories and worries - it's good to talk! I think that she found it a great help to talk to people/friends and she is a positive person - laughter can get you through tough times...she found it a great comfort to hear from others who knew someone who had experienced the same - hence the benefit of this site. She also kept herself really busy up until last week which keeps your mind off stuff - the waiting game is the real torture... She was fine even post op same day - saying she was very relieved to have the surgery done. She isn't in very much pain and has been brilliantly looked after by the Gynae unit. The worst part must be the run-up to the op and waiting on results - once my mum was in the hospital, she was just relieved. So, my advice would be keep busy, keep positive, be in company before and after, make sure you get plenty of visits while there and humour is the best tonic. You will be in good hands! All the very best to all in the forum - was good to read your thoughts...Gill x Will let you know how she fares post-op (as if she's transgender!) in the coming weeks.Â ",
