      "Content": "HI sally, to be honest your hair is coming out sooner rather than later, it's a relief once it's out because you move on, wigs i love them, i have 7 all different lengths colours styles, You will get your free one go to the stockists that they tell you, my advice is to go for a multi-tonel one that has a few highlights in it that means, the style is up to you but choppy miranda is one of my favourites and loads of my friends have tried it and it seems to suit all face shapes if you dont have a definate style to start from, when you lose all your hair the wig is too big for you so they take out a weft to make it fit you, now you can ask to keep the weft or wefts that they take out so you can use them, wait for it for a fringe, place under a hat or scarf and it softens the look and people aren't sure if you have hair or not great wee trick , and gives you more looks. I have bought loads of wigs on the internet, ebay have loads china takes a bit to arrive a lot cheaper than you think but worth waiting for ,ask away if you need anymore info, i finished fec in november and my hair in coming in fast and furious ok so its grey at the sides i dont care, i love the fact when you go in the bath it's not cold on the back of the head he he good luck on your journey, any question dont worry big or small someone will help........",
