    "Content": "Hi Janet, Cos I'm new to the site have you started chemo yet? Just started FEC chemo this week and opted for the new type cold cap (not gel, linked to refridge unit) it goes down to minus 5 and is painful but for me only for first 10 mins. I had to have it on for 2 and a half hours. I 'll give it a go, but my wig is chosen!! Good Luck Ann",
