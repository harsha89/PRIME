      "Content": "Hi I had the same problem during and after my radiotherapy. I kept washing my armpt in the sink about 10 times a day! I use a deodorant block from Lush which I find works very well for me called Aromaco. I love the smell of it which is patchouli which suits me as an aging rocker! Not everyone likes patchouli but they do others aswell! There are no nasties in them them! Veggie xxx",
