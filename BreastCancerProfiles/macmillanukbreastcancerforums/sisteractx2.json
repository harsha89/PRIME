    "Content": "yep,.. me too,.. my brother has just had 1st chemo,... second one this week,.. it breaks my heart to see him,.. he gets very low and tearful,.. and he is one to never ever complain. I have never seen him like this, ever. He is the nicest person, with a heart as big as a mountain. He keeps apologising,..makes me feel humble,.. but I know what you mean when you say it has changed something. I really don't know what to make of it all sometimes. I am supposed to be his support,... yet I feel kinda lost. Thank you for listening",
