      "Content": "Hi Moleend, Sorry to read that it has come back, you have the right to make the best decision for you. My lump was the same size 1.5cm and i had cancer in one node. My oncologist also put my details into the adjuvant site and it said that I had a 25% chance of it not returning if I had chemo. But if I didn't have it the cancer would almost certaily come back. I am 44 years old so whether age plays any part in the succes rate I don't know. Good luck with the traetment you are going to be having. Love and Hugs Amanda xx",

      "Content": "Hi Karen, thank you for the advice. Its been a month now and you were right the scars have started to improve. The lumps have started to disappear especially the ones under my arm . I have started to use bio oil to help them heal. Luckily I can still wear my usual bras as my scar is on the bottom part of my breast and the lace doesn't seem to bother it. I start chemo on the 27th November not looking forward to it to be honest.     Take Care Amanda xx",

I have taken to wearing padded bras to avoid the inevitable especially when its cold. I  have also noticed that around the scar on my breast it is hard does this improve over time? I have to have chemotherapy and radiotherapy and feel a bit daunted and scared by this. Can anyone give me any advice on how to prepare for this. Love to all x",

      "Content": "Hi Guys,  I had lumpectomy and 7 nodes removed 4 weeks ago, cancer found in one node. I had a drain inserted and removed 5 days later so had no swelling like you guys have had. This week I have tried to do more house work such as ironing, hoovering, and putting washing on the line. I thought I was doing rather well untill the aching started, I wish I could unscrew my arm and put it on the side lol. I too have stringy like things under my arms, reading your blog Nollie I'm now wondering if it is the same as you had. I saw my chemo nurse today and she told me off for doing too much so i suppose the moral is even though we may feel like we can do it we still need to take it easy and not overdo things. Glad you were finally taken seriously and hopefully now you can start to recover. Love and Hugs Amanda xx",

      "Content": "So sorry to hear that you both find yourselves on this road. But I have found that if I want to cry, laugh, shout, or just moan I come on this site and let it all out, because what you will recieve is support from everyone. Sometimes it is hard to explain to loved ones and friends about how you truly feel because you have to be strong for everyone else, when all you want to do is scream. The people on here are fantastic and understand how you feel because we are all going on the same journey. You can get advice about anything no matter how silly the question seems. You will go through so many emotions but they will get easier to bear as time goes on. Make the most of the good days and don't let this cancer lark beat you or stop you from doing what you want to do. Love and hugs Amanda xx ",

She also said to take inflamatories to help with the aching etc and to keep doing the exercises. I have done as she said and the cording is a lot better and not so sore, the aching as also improved. It is 5 weeks this thursday since having lumpectomy and SNB,  this week I have finally got the full use of my arm. I still have the numb feeling but that I can cope with. Feel sorry for my left arm that is going to be taking all the needles over the next how many months lol. Good luck to all love and hugs Amanda x",

      "Content": "Hi Judith, sorry you have had to join this site. It is a very daunting and scary journey, I got diagnosed on the 9th Oct and had lumpectomy on the 23rd. I start the first of 8 cycles of chemo on friday. The thing I found most frustrating about this whole thing is the waiting for reults, operation and treatment, I just wish they could get it all done in one go. This site and the people on it have helped me a lot with advice and their experiences. Try to keep positive, that can be sometimes hard and you may want to shout 'I don't want to be positive I want to be back to normal', because I know I did.  But if you do you know you can always do that here if you can't in the real world. Take care and good luck with your op  Love and hugs Amanda xx",

I was very worried about having this one as I had also read that it wasn't a nice one to have. I haven't had any joint pain so far and hope it won't be too bad as I already have problems with my joints. I have 3 more of these to go and hope that the side affects don't get worse with each one as they seemed to with the FEC. Good luck for your first one Love and Hugs Amanda xx",

      "Content": "Hi all, Sarah I know what you mean about your mouth being swollen and sore.My oncologist said that to try salt water and see if that helps instead of the mouth washes.  Mine still hasn't improved, now everything I eat tastes awful. I had to throw my sunday lunch away yesterday because to me it tasted awful but husband and sons ate theirs. Noj I think I must be like you the FEC i could tolerate just but this one is a different matter. I went to see my oncologist today and he said that the side affects I have had are all to do Tax. I do hope that the affects diminish with each one. My neutrofils are only 0.1 so on antibiotics to stop me getting an infection. For my next cycle of Tax I have got to have injections to help boost them up, as any one else had these injections? If so do they come in the form of a pen or proper needle, I asked who would do them and he said I could do them myself. Have finally been able to see light at the end and worked out that, as long as I have no more delays, there are only 7 weeks left till the end of chemo and all 8 are done. Then in June I start radio and think I have 3 weeks worth of this, just in time for it all to end and my holiday to start in July. I agree with you sarah thet it does feel like an uphill struggle at times but it does something to you when you can almost touch the end, it gives you a whole new load of determination to kick this thing in the teeth lol. Love and Hugs to you all Amanda xx",

      "Content": "Hi Sarah, Yes dreaded pain started on Monday which was day 3 gradually got worse through the day. On Tuesday the pain was so bad I could hardly walk had to hold on to things to get around. This week as been horrible, I also got a very sore mouth which turned out to be thrush. I went to my oncology unit to get checked out on Tuesday I felt so bad and was also told to take ibrufen and paracetomol which to be honest didn't really shift the pain, and anstatin for my mouth. The pain was maiily in my legs but is much easier now just a dull ache especially if I stand for to long. Thursday I did some ironing sitting down but at least I did it and didn't feel such a lazy bones lol. Hope you don't feel as bad as I do, felt this week like telling them to shove the next 3 treatments not sure I could go through with the pain and everything else again. What is strange for me it didn't make me feel as tired as the FEC suppose that is one good thing. But emotionally I have been a wreck and could cry at the drop of a hat. Take care Sarah and be good to yourself Love and hugs Amanda xxx    ",
