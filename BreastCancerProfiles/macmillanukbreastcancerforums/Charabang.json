    "Content": "Hi there Kargus I had burning sensations down there 4 years ago. It feels like someones set fire to me ( by the way , i know this sounds crazy but you know you can get those small cans of pop- well if you out them in the fridge/freezer then apply, it doesnt half help. So does a tin6 bit of olbas oil on a tissue quickly applied- it feels hot but its a different kind of pain that takes the original pain off) Anyway, i had mri\u2019s, xrays, cystoscopy and nothing came of them. What they now call my condition is vulvodynia ( which literally means vulval pain) Mine came on after an acute period of stress which lasted a long time. It seems that the stress, a lack of oestrogen (i was peri menopausal at the time) all contributed. I still get it now but stress exaccerbates it massively-its a real bugger Try and get some physical relief re cold packs etc until you get your results Baths made mine worse as do trousers/tight clothing Wishing you relief and all the very best outcomes XXXXXXXXX",
