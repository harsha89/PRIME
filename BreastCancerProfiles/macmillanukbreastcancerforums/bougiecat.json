      "Content": "Hi Jo, just picked up your post.  Well done for going for a positive attitude.  I'mreally lucky that I am a naturally positive person (nickname at work was Pollyanna!) and although it does drive other people mad from time to time it's really helped me get through this.  Despite being the way I am I do get bad days (who doesn't with this foul disease) I try to think of the funny things that have happened during the last 11 months - like the old lady who wandered into my room in the convalescent home by mistake.  Gave her quite a shock when I spoke to her.  She didn't answer, I just got a glare, but just as she was leaving she turned round and asked quite seriously \"have you got any cake?\".  It still makes laugh months later!  Why was I in a convalescent home?  My husband has COPD and mild Asperges syndrome so he couldn't look after me after surgery.  He didn't do much during chemo and radiotherapy either but that's another story!   I can promise you the more you try to be positive the better you'll feel in yourself and the bad days will hopefully get easier to cope with.  The very,very best of luck, have a wonderful Christmas with your family, try to laugh as much as you can and you ARE going to get through this.  Loads of love and huge virtual hugs, keep in touch",

I too had low potassium, so bad at one point the lab rang me for my pharmacy address & telephone number the same day as the blood test so that they could email the pharmacy with the prescription!  My symptoms though were breathlessness and a rapid heart rate every time I did anything more strenuous than sitting down!  Fine now though but will need another blood test to confirm.   As far as crying goes I wept for ages after an episode of \"Say Yes the Dress\" and cried for hours when my husband came home quarter of an hour late from having a glass of wine in our local bar with a couple of his friends!    I'm the kind of person who wells up during parades, listening to a children's choir and watching animal programmes but I haven't been really emotional during my treatment although I expected to be.

      "Content": "Hi Wombat, You are just 4 weeks after surgery and you'll get aches and pains everywhere but I'm glad you've got an appointment so you can get it checked out and reassure yourself.  Pain is so very debilitating and if you don't know what's causing it it'll make you depressed too.   My husband has COPD, diabetes and mild Asperges syndrome so he was pretty useless during my treatment.  In fact when I asked him how he felt he said he was glad it wasn't him!   Although he seemed less than sympathetic with me, he obviously took it all in as he spent ages telling his friends how much I was suffering.  He cannot empathise with others so although he knew I was suffering he couldn't understand how I felt or what my needs were. Try to be patient with your husband, he's probably completely bewildered by the whole thing and doesn't really know how to cope with how you're feeling.  He probably feels pretty helpless too.  Ask him to explain how he feels (without getting cross if you can!) and try to be sympathetic although you're hurting so much.  He might need a bit of reassurance so perhaps he could go to one of your appointments with you so that he can understand what's happening a bit better Remember we're here whenever you need to let off steam, and fingers crossed and loads of good luck for your appointment.  Love and hugs",

It sounds as though you're getting help with the way you feel, and your consultant understands PTSD - I don't think most people realise that cancer is a hugely life-changing experience.

      "Content": "Thanks so much for the link to Asda - I'll be going over to the UK in Feb for my great grandson's 4th birthday and I've seen a very pretty pale blue PS bra at £8.  For that price it's worth sending for one in advance and trying it isn't it!  My main problem is that my breasts (only one left now!) are very heavy and it took me years to find proper supporting bras that didn't give me back ache.  They're underwired from Bravissimo and they're lovely but of course I can't wear them now and Bravissimo don't do PS bras and only have a tiny range of non-wired bras (about 3!).  I've bought a couple of Triumph Doreen bras in my size (38G) but because of the weight I need to constantly adjust the real one.  Funnily enough the prosthesis, which is a silicone one to balance the heavy real one, doesn't need adjusting at all!  When can we wear underwired again - or is it never? :(( Love and hugs",

      "Content": "Hi Jo, With FEC my mouth tasted horrible but I was prescribed a bicarb/Eludril mouthwash and it did help.  I couldn't taste most things, water tasted foul, couldn't drink my usual myriad cups of tea, and wine and coffee were just like drinking acid!  I ate anyway but much smaller quantities as everything tasted like cardboard except Carte d'Or caramel ice cream (other brands tasted \"wrong\") which I ate loads of.  Also ordinary lemonade left to go flat helped with any nausea.  With T I continued the mouthwash but despite using it around 5 times a day I still got oral thrush at the beginning of week 2 of each cycle.  Only lasted a few days though as the mouthwash really does help.  I finished chemo at the end of August and rads at the end of October and my taste buds are much better.  Most things taste okay but some things are still a bit tasteless although I can drink coffee now and I am now having the odd glass of wine.  So you will get through this without too much hassle and it'll all be worth it in the end!  Just remember you have to eat to keep your strength up even if you aren't hungry, and drink lots to help flush the chemo through your system.  Good luck with your treatment, the time will go surprisingly quickly and we're all here for you when you need us Love and hugs",

Coffee after it's all over in Jonzac or Pons would be great Karen.  I'll make sure I keep in touch Love Wendy xxx",

Very best of luck with your treatment, we're all here for you when you don't feel so good, but it's all doable and you'll feel so proud of yourself self at the end!  Love and hugs Very best of luck with your treatment",

Very best of luck and Bon Courage as they say here! Love Wendy xx",

      "Content": "I agree, the cost of cancer care is horrendous, I had 6 neulasta injections at 1000\u20ac a time but I don't know what everything else costs although I do know the mastectomy would have been around 3000\u20ac or more.  In France we get a certain amount free from \"the Social\" which we top up with medical insurance but here you don't need a medical for insurance like you seem to need in other countries but if you are on benefits or over a certain age treatment is free.  The French system is also creaking at the seams but we don't go to the doctor for every ache or sniffle as you pay 25\u20ac each time you go.  You get most of it back but for most people it's too expensive to go for every little ailment so at least when you do have to go the queue are nowhere near as long as in the UK.  Of course I agree that savings have to be made but in the UK the layers of management, performance monitors  and target setters coupled with the amount of paperwork required these days could be cut drastically rather than cutting medical staff and hospital beds.  There's also self medication which would help and the drug companies should take some responsibility for rising costs.  I just didn't think you could do that with chemo but I understand now that with certain chemos you can. I'll get off my soapbox now!   Love and hugs",

Still got some SEs le from chemo but not too bad and I know they'll continue for a while but heyho I'm still standing (new favourite song!) and still cheerful and positive!  I bought 3 Christmas presents yesterday - one for my sister and one each for the cats - every day has its laughs!
