      "Content": "Hi Posy Thanks for your reply I am a 6th form teacher so will see how I feel nearer the time the timetable is 5  x 1 hour lessons so maybe able to do 3/5 a day. Have been separated for almost two years  but have lots of friends who have been helping with my appts at the moment, don't really like asking for help all the time. Can maybe ask my 17 year old son to help out if he is not working at the time. Best wishes Karen  ",

      "Content": "Hi have been reading through the many posts on Radiotherapy, found out yesterday that I will be having it starting in about 4 weeks time. Was wondering is it something you can cope with along side work and did you drive to/from the hospital, my drive will be about 16 miles each way. Have not been told much about this side of my treatment yet. thanks for any info.  Karen ",
