Like you I have had not good experiences with Letrozole and Tamoxifen at this point I am off all of them by choice and detoxifying my system using natural means.At no point do I advocate this route to others,but I do believe each to their own.So don't knock it until you've tried it eh? I commend you on looking and considering any means possible and wish you healing vibes for a full wholesome recovery on your journey.",

The bottom line is cost,and I love the NHS and understand all the problems they are going through,but I would just like to feel a  little bit of love given to us,who have to take this drug to help prevent re-occurrence by letting us all have Femera.  Rozzie",

Be good to yourself,let others do for you,watch all the tv you want to,stay in your onesies if you want to,don't apologise to others for feeling or looking like something the cat brought in!listen to good music dance in your chair ,laugh as much as you want to,and cry as much as you want to but at NO time feel sorry for yourself,when it's a lovely day go out or be taken out and embrace all the goodness that abounds,the universe will respond  to your wishes. Young Stephen Sutton was one of my inspirations last year when i was going thru hell,he said i have cancer but cancer doesn't have me!how great was that for an inspiring push? Healing hugs love and Light  to you.",
