      "Content": "Hi I had a mastectomy and immediate reconstruction using the diep everyone kept saying at letast you get a tummy tuck at the same time. I have to say the look size shape is brilliant other than not having a nipple yet they look pretty much the same although the reconstruction side is a bit firmer and pert. Make sure you ask about the scars how low down they will be.The scaring around the breast and under the arm arm minimal but im still getting use to have a scar which goes from hip to hip. Ask about the recovery time it's longer with the diep than with an implant. Ask questions about how it effects your stomach muscle. I hope this helps x",

      "Content": "Hi, I didn't bother with the cold cap it was upsetting when my hair started falling out exactly 2 weeks after my first chemo but I then shaved it off and felt so much better. I finished chemo January I already have a full head of hair and a style. I thought it would upset me more as I had really long hair but I personally i think you should let the chemo travell every where the cold cap stops it from getting to the top of your head. I've seen lots of other people having the cold cap it looks uncomfortable but bearable. There are no guarantees that it will save your hair but if you have it cut in a short bob first you stand a better chance. Good luck with what ever you go for x",
