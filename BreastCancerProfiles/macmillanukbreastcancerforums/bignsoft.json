      "Content": "Hi I just an appointment for two days time as a mammogram showed up an area for further investigation. It is so worrying not knowing what the outcome may be and how it could affect my life - and I amazed at how brave everyone on here is. My mum had a lumpectomy over 2 years ago now and my cousin has recently been diagnosed with terminal cancer at 40, 2 of my aunts died from cancer in their 40s and 50s, and my sister is in remission from another type of cancer. Any advice would be appreciated and I will let you know how I get on if I can... thanks",

I had so much going on my head when I had to go for the result I had visions of moving away to go nearer my family. My mum had her lumpectomy a few years ago and is still on the meds but all is clear so far since her op!! Take care x",
