      "Content": "Hello - I wonder if anyone else has suffered migraines whilst taking letrozole. I was diagnosed with BC last September and had lumpectomy and some lymph nodes removed. Radiotherapy for 15 sessions - last session last Monday  I have been taking letrozole for 2 months now and the side effects have just started to materialise. Hot flushes and muscle cramps and for the past week migraines with visual disturbance and eye/forehead/neck pressure and mild nausea. Has anyone else suffered anything similar please? ",

      "Content": "Hi Helen Thank you for your reply I shall ring my Breast care nurse tomorrow as I\u2019m not seeing my consultant until May. I too have a 1% chance and I am in serious consideration whether to continue with letrozole as on a10 year plan. I\u2019m 60 have other health issues (diabetes type 2 and ulcerative colitis being the main ones) I also have heard letrozole can have a permanent detrimental effect upon sight.  I do hope that your symptoms have eased and you\u2019re finding things better. ",
