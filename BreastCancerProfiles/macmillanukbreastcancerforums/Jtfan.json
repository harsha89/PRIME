    "Content": "Hi, Grandmap, I had RT in Jan. I used Aloe Vera gel from Holland and Barret as soon as I got home each day, to cool the skin, and the hospital gave me Zerobase to use morning and evening and I thought it was marvellous. I wore M and S soft bras, which I think were only £14 for 2. They are seamless and stretchy and I loved them! Apart from that I followed the advice to drink plenty of water, avoid alcohol and eat lots of protein to promote healing. From about half way through treatment I began to need a long afternoon nap, and went bed earlier than usual, getting about 14 hours of sleep each day. Although I had far fewer waking hours than usual, I was fine when awake! Luckily I didn't have skin problems, apart from a bit of tanning, and the tiredness eased gradually over the following month. I am back to normal, apart from some mild, slightly itchy sensations at times.  Good luck to you, hope it goes well,",
