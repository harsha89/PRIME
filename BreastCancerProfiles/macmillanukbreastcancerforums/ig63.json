      "Content": "Oh, please don't be nervous. My chemo obviously was not pleasant but it was not so awful. I stayed active, did a lot of daily basic yoga exercises, meditation etc. I have to admit that I could not be as physically active as normal and was tired but you can deal with that.  Normally I had several horrible hours approximately 5 hours after finishing the cycle and then I have not had too much to complain about. Apart from several weeks when my blood count went very low I have not cancel any of my social activities such as theatre, friends etc. I have not been doing yoga before I had cancer. But now I strongly believe that this is what helped me to pull through and especially helped me to restore movement in my arm that was damaged by the chemo injections. After the first cycle I practically could not do anything with that arm but then after I started doing yoga stretches etc it returned to nearly normal. Your hair. It is not so bad! Trust me! I bought a lot of colourful scarves from annabandana.co.uk. They are very light and bright and I love them. And they are not expensive at all. You can afford not to wash them but just through them away. You order your scarf in the morning and you might have a chance to get it the following day. Seriously, just have fun! I could not bring myself to wear a wig but it was just me. I saw women who have wigs and you would never guess that it was not their natural hair. All the best! Irina  ",

I imagine myself on the beach where we've been on holiday exactly a year ago. I close my eyes and imagine myself sunbathing, lying on a soft white sand and listening to the waves. It does help!",
