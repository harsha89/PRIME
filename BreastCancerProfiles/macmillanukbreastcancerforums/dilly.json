      "Content": "Thank you kate, always17, moonspeed, binnylarker and dorotheev for your support. I know I am very lucky to just have 8mm of dcis removed in right breast three weeks ago but I feel exhausted and what I can only describe as low grade unwell. My scar looks ok but is sore especially if I pick something up and my chest hurts and I feel sick with a dull ache in my boob. Is this normal? Â ",

      "Content": "I was diagnosed dcis 3 weeks ago and am booked to have lumpectomy on 2nd August. My first meeting with the breast care nurses is this Wednesday following my pre open assessment. What questions should I ask? I have not been told anything about grades or stages of the dcis but more that I am lucky as it is a precancer! Today I don't actually feel lucky and am quite anxious. Any advise please. Thank you.",
