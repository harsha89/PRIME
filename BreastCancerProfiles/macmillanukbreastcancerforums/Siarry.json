      "Content": "Good morning Heather,  I was just checking site and realised that I said my tumour was 14mm when in fact I should have typed 40mm. Thanks for all your advice. I think you are absolutely right that after a diagnosis of Cancer you become a different person and see life in a completely different light.  Can I possibly ask a personal questions? Did you find yourself crying at the most stupid things? I can't stop. Hugs Gill xxxx",

      "Content": "Hi Crystaljuju, Thanks for quick response. Had scan on Tuesday this week and no sign of any change in size or shape. Stand in Doctor did imply that it should be responding by now, but was advised to discuss at next appointment. I have been getting really bad side effects from medication and was just wondering when to consider alternative treatment or is it way to soon.   love Gill",

      "Content": "Hi, I have finally signed up after weeks of thinking I could cope alone. I was diagnosed in June and have been on Letrozole and monthly injections of Zoladex to reduce lump size before surgery. Does anyone know how long before any reductions in size of lump? At my last appointment on Tuesday,I was was asked to consider how I would feel about a mastectomy as lump showed no signs of reduction. My Consultant was on holiday this appointment so will discuss more next appointment, but would be very grateful if anyone could share their experiences on this matter. I have tried to google timing for reduction without success. Thanks Gill",

      "Content": "Hi Heather, Thanks so much for accepting and responding. I was diagnosed on 9th June 2016 with grade 2 ductal carcinoma ER positive 8/8, HER-2 negative Ki67 8%. Was started on Tamoxifen, but after 2 weeks was changed to Letrozole and monthly Zoladex. The tumour is 14mm but I have very small breasts so feels quite large. Was scanned on Tuesday but it has not changed at all. I am having really bad joint pains in hands,feet and back, and terrible hot flushes and night sweats. I have more side effects but so far these are the worst. Hope this info helps and you may be able to offer words of advice. Again thanks so much for responding, I am usually a \"get on with it\" sort of person but this is starting to get me down. Big Hugs Gill",
