      "Content": "Hi Sascha Rose, I got my BNF out (British National Formulare - an index of all medicines licensed in the UK), so here goes: It seems that Letrozole is preferred when the aim is breast conservation, so as small a lumpectomy as possible rather than a full mastectomy, The BNF (March 2011) also says that they should not be used for pre-menopausal women. The list of side effects for Letrozole is twice as long as for Anastrozole. Mainly nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, drowsiness, hot flushes, vaginal bleeding & dryness, and hair loss. Letrozole has the added bonus of high blood pressure, eye problems, abdo & tumour pain, arthritis, oedema and rarely embolisms. Letrozole and Anastrozole are both non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors, that means they bind certain hormone receptors and stop them from doing their work (in this case cancer cells multiplying). I hope this answers your question (I kind of wish I hadn't looked now, because I've got no idea what's coming at me yet....) Hugs! xxx",

I would hate to think that my friends have to walk on eggshells just in case they say the wrong thing! In fact, last night I was telling a friend about my hair slowly coming out and that I didn't need to pull hard for it to come off. She didn't believe me and put her hand in my hair and pulled - and had a whole handful, of course. Was it insensitive of her? Sure. Was I upset? Not really. It's going to come out anyway and at the time it was funny. She's a really good friend and will be there for practical and just listening help. I won't become oversensitive. People don't say things to deliberately upset me. They ask questions because they are working things out in their own heads what they can do, how I may feel etc. And I am always honest with my replies; I will say when I feel rubbish and I will say when I need help and I will say when I am fine.",

Nothing too taxing - I found it hard even having a normal conversation and concentrating on getting to the loo in time! Also my friends have deviced a rota: the first five days after chemo I get meals cooked for the family, I have a designated washer, one ironer and a couple of people for houswork once a week. If I need company for appointments I can take my pick. :-) This is good on so many levels: I get to chill and to concentrate on my studies. The children don't feel neglected.

I am very lucky indeed, I won't have to have the TAX, just FEC for six cycles (and a third of that will be done by tomorrow night, yay), then rads (if I agree to that, I don't really see the point) and then Herceptin. Ah, and then hormones. I was positive for everything I think! I will make a big thing of the Zombie-state I was in.

      "Content": "That depends very much on your nurse and on your trust policy. If your breast care nurse is sympathetic, she can go through your notes with you. But many 'medicals' are kind of aloof and protective of 'the notes' (I had an actual argument with my surgeon when I said I wanted to see ALL my notes!); I think they feel patients who ask to read them don't trust them. In 'my' trust you have to fill in an application to see your notes. The form asks for 'which episode' you want to see (stupid question, really. ALL episodes, but they seem to want dates). There is a fee of up to £ 50 and when that payment has gone through they have 40 days to send a copy of all the notes. Possibly in your hospital trust it doesn't cost anything, or it may cost more. Ask your breast care nurse or contact the PAL team, they will be able to tell you your exact procedure. So far I have not officially applied to see all mine, but I sneak a look at them when I am left alone with them. You are entitled to a copy of all your reports and all the letters passing between consultants and other health care professionals without charge anyway; just asking someone to copy you in should be enough.

From what I understand the rationale for having radiotherapy is exactly the same: 'just in case' there's a micro-bit in the chest wall. I am already a bit of the 'if it ain't broke, don't fix it' brigade, so don't like having chemo, but everyone was on at me, so I am going through this anyway. Do I really want another lot of just in case when chemo will supposedly get rid of all that already?

It is very well known that honey dressings will make a wound sterile, and there is good evidence that the bacteria within the honey promote wound healing. (I've seen honey work fantastically, but that was not on burns). They should be used for only a few weeks at a time, so after two or three weeks, something else should be used. However, honey dressings are very expensive, so they might not be on the first choice dressing list for your trust. Discuss it with your nurse or your GP (the nurse probably knows better). I think there are also alginate dressings - equally expensive, and the most recent research I found showed that honey works better. Hope you get this sorted! Petra x",

From my perspective the mastectomy was a real doddle (haven't had chemo yet, so no comparison). I went to theatre at 4, got to the ward about 6. I found texting really tiring for the next couple of hours (I'd send one text and feel exhausted!), but the MOBILE is definitely a must bring. I got up to use the toilet straight away - the first time a nurse walked me there, but I walked back on my own. The drains came out at ten the next morning and I was discharged (including letter) at 11. On my list to take would be: the mobile and charger, pyjamas, a sports bra (or a post surgery one, def. one without wire), wash stuff & tooth brush and if you want a soft towel (as opposed to the NHS ones) bring that. Oh, and I had a uni friend (we're studying nursing and were on placement) bring me decent coffee as she was placed at the hospital I was at. Of course, if you are scheduled for a longer stay than just overnight, you'll need more for entertainment, laptop/books etc. and some nice treats, like chocolate. Three weeks later I started my placement (because of the op I am behind everyone else now) on a heavy neuro rehab ward and I am absolutely fine. So what you need to leave behind is your worries.
