As to diet I have to control it as a type two diabetic (diet controlled) Been off meds for nine months now and this will be another hurdle not to jump though but crawl if must!  Stockpiled butternut and carrot soup also pumpkin and cinnamon ready for when return to work! Will have to see what happens to the taste buds! Please keep me informed about any cravings and see what we can come up with.  ",

Doing my exercises regularly as advised. Will take a look at the Chemo club thank you",

Thank you for the beautiful wording taken from the bottom of your soul and shared amongst us. I hope your last cycle will be kind to you. Look forward to the future with renewed positive energy.

      "Content": "Hello Soups and Crytraljuju, I'm in same boat! I rang my works HR to inform that being my six months sick leave comes to a close on 23/05/16. Just told will be going down to half pay from 25/05/16. I am entitled full pay for the time as worked continuous for sixteen years and yet when received my wage slip for last month they have only gone and put me on SSP without no notification at all! Cannot wait for the works wage dept to open on Tuesday they are going to get such a ear bashing. HR didn't even no that I had breast cancer, talk about lack of communication! Go to GP to get fit for work on phase return to work, but they only do that for four weeks regardless. Hoping to get appt with OH before then. Each month have sent in fit to return notes with a covering letter to service manager(no reply or acknowledgement by return post!) had one text from a ward manager to ask when coming back to work! My holidays from last year still comprise of ten days plus three bank holidays!  plus from 1st April entitled to 33days plus 8 bank holidays! I feel demoralised and slightly deflated by the way things have happened and been treated. Watch this space will let you know how get on.  Onwards and upwards. Mistia",

      "Content": "Hi, just thought I would let you know I think the \"brave the shave\" is horrendous advertising. We didn't ask for all us us to get Cancer, go though chemotherapy and get all the side effects one of which is hair lost. It makes me cringe every time it comes on, I wasn't laughing and joking when my hair was coming out in handfuls, my hairdresser was crying with me when she clippered my hair to a number one. I lost my femininity, my hair is who I was! Lost confidence always wore a hat or turban. It was when my head resembled a blotched patten that my fantastic sister come over and shaved my head, you could here a pin drop in the bathroom! Not a word was said! I now have hair of about two centimetres long and next week is final four boost radiotherapy. (Eyebrows and eyelashes also making an appearance!). I personally find the campaign patronising and offensive and not taking into consideration our feelings. Onwards and upwards. Mistia.",

It's not like me I'm usually the strong one who holds everyone else up and pretty resililant, but this has gone and knocked me sideways! It feels like I'm in suspended animation looking at me from outside in! Six days in still have slight headache, nausea, mouth feels like a sewer even though keep brushing teeth and using mouthwash! Blood sugars still a bit cranky! Sorry for rant but it's so soul destroying! I know there's still a way to go and light at the end of the tunnel but my mojo has deflated and cannot kickstart myself yet again. Going to try and go out for a walk on my own to see if can clear some of the fog that's cycling above me! Thank you for listening to me gabble on. Forever the optimist onwards and upwards!",

Still have some swelling from WLE and node excision but it's only been nine days since op. Don't forget to claim back the VAT at cash desk!  Brought a Vshaped pillow for supporting under arm.All the best for your op will be thinking of you. XXX",
