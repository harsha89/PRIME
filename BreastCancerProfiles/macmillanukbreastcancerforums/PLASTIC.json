      "Content": "Your thoughts were with me today---knowing people in the similar position helps, in the end I went alone. It was much easier than I thought, took ages to tell me how it works and what to expect. . Then an appointment with my specialist who told me I had Metaplastic Triple Negative B C  with no Lymph node involvement that's good as it is an aggressive form. I start Chemo on 15/ 09/17 via picc line--12 weeks  Paclitaxel then 4 cycles of A C just pray it works then have surgery, with Metaplastic T N and having Lupus I can't have any other medication. I am determined to get over this although I'm mid 70s I still have plenty to do. Thoughts and hugs to all in the similar position---   if Metaplastic. please get in touch.                Plastic   XXXXX",
