      "Content": "So sorry to hear of your second diagnosis. I'm having lots of mouth problems too - trouble swallowing, raw throat, hugely acidic, mouth ulcers and my personal favourite....oral thrush. The yellow liquid Nistacin (I'm in Spain, may be spelled differently in U.K.) gives me nausea and my oncologist has prescribed antibiotics. I have also been advised to add a pinch of bicarbonate of soda to my water bottle to reduce the effect of acid contributing to throat soreness. Finally, there is a product called GelClair - it is the first thing I have used which seems to make a difference. It's expensive but I believe is available on prescription in the UK. I would recommend you check anything with your doctor before starting to take it. Hope something gives relief.",

I'm having terrible panics as I also have heart problems so am not receiving herceptin which I also need. However, I have spoken to a few charities and oncologists and the practical issue is that we cannot start radiotherapy with damaged skin. Secondly, the radiotherapy timings are not the same for everyone and there is no agreed deadline on timing for effectiveness. I hope this helps, I'm in a terrible state at the moment with anxiety which just seems to have crept up on me. Talk to your oncologist about how you feel - mine did try to reassure me I'm not in imminent danger. I live in Spain, it's very hot right now, don't know which part you are visiting but try and enjoy it. Best wishes",

I'm guessing you are being referred for mammogram and/or ultrasound - I can't tell you not to worry but do remember that these are also tools used to rule cancer out, not just for ruling it in. You have done the right thing by acting on the lump so you should feel proud of that. Hopefully you will get the all clear and there will be another reason for your current discomfort. If anything suspicious shows up you will - I believe almost certainly - be referred for biopsy - but remember the referral would not mean you have cancer, only the pathology results could confirm it. For me the waiting and fear of results was terrifying and a lot of others would probably agree. In the meantime, try to stay positive, keep busy, think about confiding in someone and take everything one day at a time. With best wishes.",

I'm sure others will comment but I started treatment in January and after 6 months chemo had surgery, developed a burst seroma and found out I have heart damage. I was angry for most of August. I'm not really sure why, who it was aimed at....just the general crapness (probably not a word)of cancer, the misery of watching my mum and dad struggle with my diagnosis, feeling let down by my body which I've always looked after, some pretty insensitive nurses providing August cover - here in Spain everything just stops for a month, my treatment other than the Summer blip has been amazing.... Rant away, plan something nice, I let loose on a punch bag once in a while....it's hard to come to terms with a more uncertain future, and trying to secure a future I think we all feel overwhelmed sometimes by the decisions we have to make about treatment. good luck. ",

She didn't start the weekly T until the 21st day from the final FEC-T.  I almost had to fly for a family emergency, thankfully avoided at the last moment, but my oncologist said whilst it wasn't ideal it was possible. However she recommended loose clothing including socks to cover my skin, as well as cotton gloves (it's well documented that seat belts and food trays/tray tables are swimming in germs)and a face mask. She also said not to eat or drink anything served on board as the air hostesses' hands will have come into contact with all sorts of germs. Was kind of relieved it didn't happen!! Now that I want to travel for my sister's 50th the day after what should be my final chemo before surgery she has said no!",

I'm in absolute turmoil about it, it really bothers me to the extent that I simply don't know how women even get to the hospital knowing they're coming out with only one breast. I know it sounds pathetic and I understand it's lifesaving but I'm really struggling to cope with it. So, I think she's afraid I'm going to do a runner! No, tempting as it seems I won't. In reality it is because here in Spain most district hospitals more or close in August and certainly senior surgeons take holiday. She doesn't want me to risk an infection that could cause a delay and push me into August when certainly some of my care team will be absent. Hope you are doing ok. X",

I did have full node clearance and wide lumpectomy, and developed a seroma too! They can take quite a few weeks, there's not a lot can be done until the tissue heals and the cavity stops filling. The draining will take the pressure off and as you start to heal the liquid will reduce to an amount that your body can absorb. As I understand it they don't put drains in the lumpectomy site at this point because of the infection risk but also because we have to heal from the inside. Ultimately healing time depends on the seroma size but your nurse should be able to give you a decent estimate. Good luck.",

To put your mind at rest, i was diagnosed stage 3 Dec 2016, I had 8 sessions of chemo Jan-June 2017, wide lumpectomy and full node removal July 2017. I developed a seroma which burst and opened the scar. It took 14 weeks to heal ( they can't restitch, it has to heal from the inside out). I was terrified at the delay but my oncologist, the radiologist, a second opinion, plus confirmation by Macmillan staff helped a lot - medical opinion is you must start within 6 months. All were very clear on this. Anyone who did not present clear margins post surgery would ideally have a second surgery and may be elevated in the radiotherapy queue. However, the chemo, other systemic treatments/hormone and targeted therapies etc act as curative and preventative treatment. As others have posted, the radiotherapy is belts and braces for most of us. I started on tamoxifen and herceptin prior to starting radiotherapy which gave me added comfort. I had 31 radiotherapy sessions, had no burned skin, just the occasional feeling of tightness and the skin has stayed slightly darker. My only regret is that the marker tattoos were done in green so I appear to have 5 mould spots! I wish you all the best but try not to worry about the delay. ",

I actually live in Spain and due to the heat they are very careful of the wound site, I leak serous fluid daily with a bit of blood.  I don't have any infection but am into week 6 of daily cleaning so understand your frustration. Please don't put anything on it until it has been assessed, if the wound is at all open there is an infection risk.  Over here they use a product called ProntoSan, it's definitely used in the U.K. too because the instructions are in Spanish, English and a host of other languages. I'm sure it will all be fine but definitely follow it up with the surgeon if you have chance as some of these problems are very specific to lumpectomies and the cavities they create in breast tissue.

My problems started before the tamoxifen and I have only just started herceptin injections so don't know what they will do! I use Rosoltrof, sadly here in Spain not available on prescription but very effective. I had let things get pretty bad (I actually thought I was suffering from repeated bouts of thrush and cystitis) and used rosoltrof every night for 6 weeks. I then went to alternate nights and now twice a week. I wouldn't say everything was completely back to normal but it has helped! The gynaecologist explained that depending on the level of the problem some products act short term, others act to mimic oestrogen and stop the tissue atrophy. Maybe ask your oncologist for a gynaecologist referral if the problem persists, I was lucky, mine was very understanding. Good luck!",

      "Content": "I can only say hang in there. Throughout this experience the waiting is, for a lot of us, tougher than the treatment. I found a lump in my armpit 13 December 2016. Biopsies confirmed two breast tumours (4 1/2 and 2 1/2 cm) and lymph node involvement. I got that news 22/12 and thankfully only waited a few weeks to be told it hadn't spread. We are the lucky ones, even though it is a ridiculous thing to say. I started chemo 18/1/17 and was almost relieved. When you have a treatment plan you will feel more in control. It would be silly to say it's plain sailing, sometimes it's bloody miserable, but I worked part time throughout chemo although in retrospect I'm not sure it was a great idea at the end. I had surgery in July, unfortunately I developed complications from surgery and chemo so I'm still in radiotherapy and may have to have some more treatment. I don't say this to scare you, but simply to say treatment is amazing, advanced and supportive. You will find strength you didn't know you had. When I'm in a bad patch I allow myself 10 minutes of balling my eyes out and then pick myself up. Believe it or not, yesterday I was told my radiotherapy sessions were being upped to 33 ( not fun when it's nearly 2 hours drive each way) and tonight I've been crying with laughter with my amazing husband. I never thought it would go on for so long, nor be so tough or complicated. But, like the hundreds of amazing women on here who will help you, you will do it too. The support here is fantastic and don't forget support is available for your family too. Right now, fill minutes and hours, then days, then just keep muddling through. Fear and worry are normal throughout this process, worse at some points than others and certainly overwhelming the first few weeks. Be kind to yourself. Very best wishes. PS the advice I wish I'd listened to...stay off google at 3am and don't be afraid to ask about your diagnosis, pathology and prognosis to whatever level you are comfortable with. Finally remember that primary breast cancer is a disease that you are likely to beat.",

Tomorrow I have an ultrasound on my left breast as the nipple has inverted ( it started sinking inward and now is virtually a closed slit) during the last month. It's very sore but no discharge. Skin is a bit puckered around the areola. There is also a prominent vein. It's the same breast that I had a WLE on in July 2017 ( stage 3 oestrogen/her2+). I can't feel a lump but my breast is very hard after surgery and radiation so I find self examination quite difficult. I do feel there's a bit of swelling as my bras feel uncomfortable and I have more of that strange heaviness feeling that I know is normal after WLE. I'm trying to stay calm, and wondering if these changes can be down to past treatment? Is it really possible that after 6 months chemo, surgery, radiation, herceptin and 2 years into tamoxifen that I could have cancer? If I have to go through treatment again I will, but today the nerves have hit. I haven't told anyone close to me as I don't want them to worry. My mum has just had a mastectomy and still needs radiation, her diagnosis came within a few months of me finishing herceptin ( no genetic link). Has anyone else had these types of late post-treatment symptoms? Thankyou so much.",

      "Content": "Hi I'm also facing surgery in July having just finished 6 months of chemo to reduce two tumours in my left breast. Having originally been told I would need a mastectomy, the tumours are virtually undetectable and I may now have the possibility of lumpectomy. In any case, I am a 32ee and have worried since day 1 about symmetry,I'm thin so an implant is really my only option. Here in Spain they don't do immediate reconstruction if radiotherapy is part of treatment so mentally I'm struggling with the idea of being lopsided. Reconstruction can also be complex if skin isn't conserved and I fully expect to need a left side expander and reduction and uplift to the right breast. I considered asking for a double mastectomy but my gut feeling was that I didn't really want one, I would like to maintain some sensitivity to the breast and in my case, there would be no protection in a double operation. What I do know is that there are options both at the time of surgery and in the months and years following. For many women, more than one operation is required but I think speak to as many people as you can and go with your gut feeling. For some of us, reconstruction is hugely important, others cope well without it, some hospitals seem adequately prepared with plastic surgeons, others don't, some teams seem to view reconstruction as past of recovery, others as vanity. It's sometimes hard to push for what we really feel when we feel so vulnerable. I ended up writing it in a letter because I didn't feel my oncologist understood who I feel about losing a breast, for me it helped a lot. Good luck, I am very scared and uncertain but I am sure we will find the strength. X",

For anyone else affected by heart damage there are new Spanish/Norwegian studies using as much up to date info as they have on perjeta/herceptin given with the T cycle which is suggesting that 6 months of follow up herceptin may become the standard as the perjeta input is giving better results. Control groups are underway - as you say, too early to show anything conclusive, but positive for those of us unlucky enough to be heart-affected. Hope all your test results bring good news.",

      "Content": "Hi, I'm pretty new at this too but have already had some lovely messages from people on this site and there's no doubt that being forewarned helps. I'm 2 sessions in and have been told I need 6 months of chemo. It's not scary at hospital which was a big surprise to me. You very quickly meet others and I have the same oncology and nursing team each visit. It's very personal. My treatment takes about 2 1/2 hours, with blood test before I'm probably there 4 hours in total. I'm having treatment in Spain and they don't offer cold cap with certain combinations because hair loss is a certainty. Good luck with your treatment.",

Don't know if I need a hug or a kick up the....having gone through chemo and surgery I have stalled. Can't start RT until my burst seroma heals and have to have it checked at the health centre twice a week, and hospital once. The scar has just been stapled, not to close it completely but to try and   speed up the healing. Have been on tamoxifen 2 months and really struggling with nausea and menopausal symptoms. Have just started herceptin injections but have to take 3 heart medications as the chemo caused damage. I'm working and to be honest, feel totally overwhelmed. To top it all, I've got a recurrence of oral thrush which plagued me throughout chemo. Feeling very low, I just thought I had the worst bits behind me but I feel like treatment will never end and I'm rattling with all the pills and struggling with all the side effects and seroma. Sorry for the whinge, but finding it tough. Thanks",

      "Content": " Please don't be terrified by chemo if you have to have it. I was really scared, but next Wednesday is my final session and I've been having it 6 months to reduce my tumours prior to surgery. To my mind you have done the tough part with the double mx. I have a single mx to come in July and if I had the choice I'd do another 6 months chemo. Chemo does make you feel crap some of the time, but not all the time. I've worked throughout although confess in the latter stages I would have preferred not to. You'll have plenty of ok days, and some good ones. Ask questions and use the forum, speak to a nurse about anything you are afraid of and don't hold back in asking for medication to manage side effects. My initial nausea was terrible and the tablets didn't really touch it so I asked if there was anything else, and there was. The best thing about chemo is that it passes and any damage is recoverable. Hair and nails will grow back, for example. I wish you all the best but you have done so much already, if you have to you will do the chemo too.",

      "Content": "Londonlass and Ronstar thankyou for kind words (you were right, definitely needed today) and advice. I've also always considered myself capable, a \"do-er\" and tough but I've definitely been running out of steam. I actually live in Spain, a beautiful rural part of Andalucía and I'm self employed. Unfortunately there are no welfare benefits available so stopping work hasnt been an option. I worked through chemo too, like a zombie towards the end. I think I do need to put some thought into this - work started as a welcome relief from cancer, but it's exhausting me now. I just renewed my tamoxifen prescription and asked the pharmacist if other brands are available - he said I get the generic brand unless specified by my oncologist so I will mention it at my next appointment. I guess over 5 years we can work our way through quite a few! I need to go back to a day at a time, I know I will get there in the end and for so many of us the complications seem endless. Thankyou again, best wishes to everyone.",

      "Content": "Hi I am pretty much through treatment now and don't come on the site so often now but am having a sleepless wobbly night and always find great advice and support here, of which you will receive plenty.  Of course you are terrified, I remember the 3 weeks of tests after getting positive biopsy results as possibly the most terrifying. As you say, the biggest fear is secondaries. It is easy to say with retrospect but you need to try and just get through chunks of time. If you can, confide in a few close friends/family. I didn't really want to tell anyone at the biopsy stage until I knew what I was dealing with. I was ultimately diagnosed with 3 tumours, all joined together. Like you, the largest was 4.5 cm and I had 3 infected nodes. The chemo is given first to shrink/eradicate the tumours. It's not an easy process but certainly in the early rounds you won't probably feel ill every day. The experience is different for everyone but remember there are lots of drugs to counter the side effects. Hair loss is almost a given so try to think how you feel about that, I had a crop before I started to prepare myself but in the event when my hair did start to shed I actually  thought \"good\" because the chemo was getting to work. Surgery decisions regarding mastectomy/lumpectomy are not necessarily taken at the beginning because no one knows how your cancer is going to react to chemo. For many, me included, the waiting periods are probably the most stressful. It's ok to be terrified, I never thought I could get past the fear but the time does pass. You will surprise yourself with your strength, you will come through it as an invincible and inspirational mum. My best friend also had bc as a single mum with a 4 year old - Macmillan has great resources to help explain to children. My friend is cancer free, her son remembers the time of \"mum's poorly boob\" but not the length or severity of treatment. The school and other mums were great, helping with pick up and drop off etc.  Right now you are overwhelmed. The pieces start to slot together and you will feel more in control. Make sure you have help and support. You will always find a friend on here, masses of support and advice and expert help from Macmillan. Wishing you the very best of luck, x",

      "Content": "Hi I can't medically advise you but I was diagnosed with stage 3 her2+ (100%) ER+ (40%) in Dec 16. I did 4 rounds of EC and 4 rounds of T which included perjeta and herceptin. Chemo finished 14/6/17. I had surgery 13/7 when it was discovered in my quarterly ecocardio that I had suffered heart damage along the way. After surgery I developed a seroma which burst, opening the scar and delaying radiotherapy but have persevered with a ton of additional medication and next Wednesday will finally finish herceptin. My point in sharing this is that although my last 3 of 8 chemo were bloody awful, I simply was not prepared for serious complications in the later parts of treatment. You can turn chemo down ( and I respect anyone's decision, and of course everyone's profile is different, mine was vital to reduce the tumours) but there is always the small risk that the treatments you agree to could be problematic so you may wish you had not closed down other options.  Tamoxifen is not a walk in the park, I am struggling massively with hot flushes, headaches and insomnia. I will persevere, but the drop out rate is quite high. I think the point is that her2 cancer is aggressive and my oncologist believes everything should be thrown at it because risk of recurrence is highest within the first 2 years. With herceptin and perjeta ( routinely given here in Spain since 2015) it needn't be so threatening. Could you get an OncDX test to help in your decision? A few people have commented on the predict tool rightly stating it is outdated relative to drug regimes today. Initial research in Spain for patients receiving herceptin and perjeta in combination show a significant increase in complete pathological response to chemo. I appreciate the NICE guidelines are different regarding perjeta. I hope whatever treatment you decide is successful and most importantly that the decision is right for you.",
