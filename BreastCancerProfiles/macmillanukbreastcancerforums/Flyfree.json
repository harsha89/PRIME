      "Content": "Hi there, I had 4 rounds of EC and have had 8 of 12 weekly rounds weekly of Paclitaxel, pertuzumab and trastuzumab. Paclitaxel and Docetaxel are very similar as they are both Taxols. My oncologist said the main difference between them regarding side effects is that Docetaxel tends to have less peripheral neuropathy but worse neutropenia. The first week I was given Paclitaxel only so that the side effects of the chemo alone could be assessed separately. I received all three the second week. Everyone is different and I think my experience is not the norm but nevertheless honest. Here goes; I was told that the new regime was usually much easier regarding nausea than EC. I had diarrhea, and intense nausea for 9 days following each EC and none of the anti-emetics helped, but I didn't actually vomit. However with the first Taxol I didn't feel too bad, perhaps a little tired, but on the second and third week I was vomiting as well as having diarrhea and stomach pain, so they started giving me long acting intravenous antiemetic premeds, Fosaprepitant and Palanosetron. I haven't vomited since but have been very nauseous. Other symptoms have been night sweats and general flu like aches up to 48hrs after and slight sore fingers which comes and goes.I've only had two weeks without nausea so far (not sure why) and the weeks I have trastuzumab and pertuzumab I am extremely tired, nauseous, and struggle to eat but could probably manage a one off wedding if I paced myself and took it easy the rest of the week. I think in general the symptoms seem to be getting slightly worse week by week, but that may be an illusion because with weekly treatment its harder to recover before the next and I've gradually become more tired. The Oncologist told me he does see the odd person with side effects like mine, but I'm unusual, however the Chemo nurse said it wasn't that uncommon. Definitely tell them about the wedding, but you may want to plan it so that you can take a break during the day if needed. Best of luck and I hope you get to enjoy the wedding.",

      "Content": "Hi Jenny, I'm sorry you are having such a hard time and your partner is not dealing with it very well. It can be very lonely having chemo even when you do have people helping, as no one really understands how it feels unless they have been through it.  I think this is the one time in your life when you should not feel guilty asking for help. People don't know how to help. sometimes you have to tell them what you need. I've always been useless at it, but have started directing everyone on how they can help and I find most people are relieved to have specific instructions as they don't have to worry about how they can help. I've allocated jobs according to what suits each person. I read somewhere someone said 'Food not Flowers' so that has become my mantra. My mother-in-law likes cooking so I bought her some disposable cartons to put food aside and freeze for me to have when I can't face cooking. I've had to direct my daughter and husband to do various chores, which was a struggle at first but now they are in the habit of it, I hardly need say anything. Big hugs to you xx",

      "Content": "Hi SammyStaff, I'm so glad you made the wedding and felt well. The mouth thing is so horrible. I've had it every day, but not always all day. Mornings are usually better and the symptoms tend to fade as the week wears on. However I've had it throughout and am now on week 9. Of course everyone is different. I take it you are using an extra soft toothbrush? I tried mouthwash at the beginning but found it made my mouth more sore. I've found sucking various sweets helps with the tastes but eating too many makes the stomach cramps and bloating worse. I've swapped from sherbert lemons, to werthers originals, to now on mint imperials. I've heard some people chew gum, but that makes me even more bloated. Have you tried something spicy like chili con carni with rice or putting tomato sauce on things, I found that helped with the taste thing and eggs seem quite good. I do hope you find a way to manage the symptoms soon. Its not easy Big hugs",

It does help.  I've just had another difficult night with sharp pain from where the expander is digging in and have had to sleep sitting up, but now I know that it's to be expected, I won't worry. Hopefully I will gradually improve as you have and the permanent implants will be much more comfortable for both of us. How many weeks post op are you now? Best wishes for your recovery x",

      "Content": "Hi Tilly, Thank you for your reply. It\u2019s good to hear from someone whose had a similar op and I'm glad that you are doing well 4 months post op.  From what I've read I think expanders tend to be more uncomfortable than permanent implants so I'm hoping it'll feel much better once I have that. You're right it is early days and I guess like many I'm keen to get back to normal as soon as possible, but I've been very careful as I wouldn't want to risk it going wrong. However, I probably need to be more patient. I wish you well with your continued recovery and thank once again. xxx",

      "Content": "It seems that you've had a similar experience with expanders as I am having and I've been doing the same, walking around holding the expanding to stop it pressing through the skin. It feels as I'm being stabbed or similar to having a sharp stone in your shoe! I've tried to stay on my back at night, but I think I've been rolling on to my side and front and then wake up in pain and am sore all day. Last night I managed to stay on my back, so I'm all good today! It makes such a difference. I'm sorry to hear that you had to go through the additional worry and pain of more surgery. As you say it's a long enough process anyway. I know I can't wait until all my treatment is behind me and I can stop having to think about it. It sounds as if your  doctors are on top of it though and i'm glad to hear you are back on track and,healing well. Good luck with the implants. As you are ahead of me, I'd be grateful if you could let me know how you get on. ",

      "Content": "Following 6 months chemotherapy, 4 weeks ago I had a skin sparing mastectomy with a reconstruction using an ADM pocket to attach an  expander implant to the outside of my pec. I will have a further operation to replace the expander with a silicon implant once the expander has been filled to the appropriate volume. It seems that this type of reconstruction is less common therefore I am hoping to hear from anyone who has had a similar reconstruction? 4 weeks on and I'm still in quite a bit of pain at times and limited in what i can do. I was wondering what i might expect going forward?   ",
