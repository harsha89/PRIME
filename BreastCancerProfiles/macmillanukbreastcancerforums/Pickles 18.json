      "Content": "Thanks everyone not meeting my oncologist to next wk and I've basically changes my mind every day this last wk. I'm just not sure initial gut was to do chemo but i think that's because before breast cancer comes knocking on your door you automatically associate it with chemo however when your in the middle of it you realise  its so much more complex and you learn things you never knew about or has to think of and realise that in many cases there are tailored options. I am being positive but every so often a little doubt creeps in and I find myself shutting out the outside world and avoidance is becoming a new thing!! I actually feel this is worse than waiting for diagnosis or getting the masectomy !!",

I have spoken to number of people many reluctant to give an opinion in case they are the reason I pick one way or another. I did decide reluctantly to get it. And called my oncologist yesterday and left a message. They called today for a brief chat and asked to see me again next wk. Now I'm sensing they may be trying to talk me out of my decision or perhaps I'm reading too much into it they did say they'd spoken to other oncologists who had also said given my results it would be a reasonable decision not to get chemo! More confused than ever lol. Also I just want to get on next step of this as I feel I'm wasting time if that makes sense?. And I'm stressing so much I'm eating like a horse!!!",

But it doesn't make this any easier, had masectomy in July and recovering from infection .. Just don't cope well not being in control and this is testing me lol",

Have been getting it Drained and also wounds changed dailyBut no where as traumatic as your experience by the sound of it . But I do understand a little of how you are feeling as I'm sick of nurses and doctors and temperatures and generally feeling sick ifthat makes sense.  Hope things start to improve for you thinking of you ",
