    "Content": "Hi Chrissi I was diagnosed with Inflammatory Breast Cancer in April and was told from the start ( by two different consultants) that I must have chemo first, then mastectomy/axillary clearance and radio. As it happens I am also having another lot of chemo. I was told that reconstruction at time of mastectomy was likely to break down with radio and they would not consider it. To give the consultant is due, he did actually discuss this at MDM with collagues and they were all in agreeement. So I have been promised one, hopefully June/July next year. I am on Herceptin now but no one has mentioned that would come into the equation when deciding on date for recon. To get breast cancer was always my biggest dread and to have to go through a mastectomy was my worst nightmare. I feel horribly disfigured and worry about people noticing the 'difference'. I only told 5 people the full extent of my surgery as I could hardly bear to say the words. I have accepted how I look and avoid mirrors as far as poss! The only thing that does keep me going is having a reconstruction, the sooner, the better. I was always proud of my boobs and just hate the way I am now. I feel a bit of a failure when so many ladies seem to sail through this op, being so brave and accept the way it changes the body for ever. I so wish I could be like that! I have this awful fear that I won't get a recon so I am trying to think how I can cope if I don't....... I don't think doctors encourage reconstruction, you really have to ask and keep asking. I don't know whether it is the expense or the fact that it is a major operation. It should be our right to be offered this and as long as options are fully discussed with pros/cons that we can make an informed decision on what is right for 'me'. I do wish you good luck and remember, however hard it is (and it really is) we are more than just a pair of boobs! We are so special and made stronger by what we are going through. Take care and hoping you get your dearest wish with love Millee xx          ",
