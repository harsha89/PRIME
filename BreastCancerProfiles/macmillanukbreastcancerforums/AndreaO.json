      "Content": "Hi Gill, please may I welcome you to this site even though noneof us want to be here we are and we are dealing with it. This site has been a sanity site for me since 9th September when I was too diagnosed with 2 tumours in my right breast. I had a mastectomy on 18th sept and I had my first chemo week last Thurs. Everything has gone so fast like being on a roller coaster. I have also had my ups and downs but having just got through my first week of chemo am beginning to feel much better at the moment. I am 47 years old have a wonderful hubby and 2 sons 16 & 13 yrs which we have kept fully informed right from the beginning. Yes I have asked on many occasions 'why me?' And still do on bad days, not having any history in my family, I can truly still say I can't believe I have C !! The people on here have been absolutely fantastic and it is a wealth of valuable information even though each and every one of us are different and react differently to treatment. When I need information this is the place to come. The waiting days you are going through now will pass and you will very soon know your course of treatment. I wish you well on your journey and I am sure your life has turned upside down just like mine has for me and my family. If you need to chat you know where I am Andrea xxx",

I had my first chemo FEC last Thursday and today I am just starting to feel a little bit normal again so I'm hoping that the first week was the worst. I have suffered massively with tiredness beyond anything I could imagine and heartburn was excruciating but the dr prescribed me tablets for that and is now not as bad. My first evening home I felt very very sick but this was short lived with all the anti sickness so make sure you take everything. I'm thinking of you this evening Love Andrea x",

      "Content": "I have just read your blog about yourself and my diagnosis is very similar to yours. 2 tumours in right breast grade 2 Her2+ (protein & oestrogen fed tumours) I had a right mx and 4 nodes removed on 18-9-13 Had results last week that 1 of 4 nodes showing positive so got to have a full node clearance after my chemo which starts soon. Also had a call today to go for a CT scan on Weds. I am thinking about using the CC so everything you have put here is a huge help and I'm going to discuss it with my onco when I get appointment through. But I'm not sure whether to just face up to hairloss and go with it. Did you lose your eye brows & lashes ? I'm very apprehensive & scared but think I am coping reasonably well. It's strange how you have had chemo first then mx but I was other way around. I too had two tumours around 30mm each. Thank you for reading Andrea x",

At the beginning when I was diagnosed I asked my BCN what I could do to help myself as everything seemed out of my hands her reply was do everything they tell you, take all the drugs they give you - they will help, and do not refuse any treatment! I am 48. She said think about the long term outcome not just the next few months and all the treatments individually might only look as if they improve prognosis by a small % but add them all together and they greatly improve your outcome. I had 3 x FEC where I was off work for week 1 but then worked throughout week 2 & 3 then I had 3 x Taxotere where I was ok week 1 but had week 2 off then back at work for week 3. The side effects of the 2 treatments are so so different but they are so do'able. Take each one as it comes and each day thereafter you will soon be at the end of your treatment and it will be worth it !!! Good luck to you and use this site when you need a chat on those not so good days x",

I was diagnosed on 9-9-13 had right mastectomy and 4 nodes taken on 18-9-13. I too have got over the operation very well but know exactly what you mean about sleeping on that side - very frustrating but unfortunately no resolution but it does get better I can lay on my side for a short while, one step at a time. I start my chemo on Thurs (I certainly won't forget this Halloween) and am very apprehensive but I know this is the best and correct path for me. I asked my BC nurse how I could ensure I was in the 85% success and not the 15% unsuccessful and her answer was a very quick 'make sure you do everything they give to you and do as you are told - never refuse anything!'. No one could put it more simpler. After chemo I am due a full node clearance followed by herceptin, rads & tamoxifen, yes a very long journey one I would much rather not be taking but I am here and one step at a time - I seem to be saying this a lot at the moment. Much better than looking at the whole long journey. I wish you well on your long journey it will be nice to chat as we are so near (time wise) and similar. Andrea x",

      "Content": "Hi kargus. My situation is slightly different from yours - I was diagnosed last September had a right mastectomy within 2 weeks followed by 6 lots of chemo the last being on 13th march then on this Wednesday I go back in to have full node clearance. Not looking forward to it but I am looking at it as just another step along the ladder. Hopefully it goes ok. But in answer to your question I tried the cold cap in my first chemo it was very long winded and VERY cold I very nearly pulled it off within the first hour but I was determined to stick it out but then just before my no.2 chemo the hair started falling out in massive clumps so I chose not to have it again and face the inevitable but I know people that it has worked for. I know it has to be a real tight fit to touch the whole of the head it is uncomfortable but if it works maybe worth it. I too don't know why I've been chosen to go through this but we are here and with each other's help we can get through it. Just take one step at a time. Good luck with your treatment I won't lie it's not easy but it is doable I actually went into work on my good days as I found that was better for me rather than sitting around the house. I generally was in bed for the first week after FEC BT then the next 2 weeks weren't so bad but the TAX was different it took a few days for that to kick in. I'm here if you need me. Andrea x",
