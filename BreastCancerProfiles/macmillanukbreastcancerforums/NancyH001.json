    "Content": "Hi, used the cool cap too. My first treatment was Nov. 29 and my last one was Jan. 31. I kept 60% of my hair until after my last treatment. But yes, the brush did show a lot of hair throughout the treatment. I did think I was going to be in good shape but I am 6 weeks from my last treatment and still losing hair. So not sure what is going on. I have read that continuing to use the cool cap will help your hair grow back faster but it may be too early to tell if this is true. So sorry that you have added stress with this shedding. If anyone else has some more insight to add please send it along.",
