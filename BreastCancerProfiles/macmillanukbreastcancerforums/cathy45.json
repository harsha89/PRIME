      "Content": "Just thought it might be worth sharing my experience of using the cold cap in case anyone's wondering about trying it. I've just had my third lot of chemo and have used the cold cap each time. I looked up some comments on people's blogs before I started to get a few tips but have since learnt a bit more from experience. One thing that seems to have helped is taking a couple of paracetamol beforehand - this has helped it not to be too painful. Also make sure you take a hot drink in with you. Take sips and hold them in your mouth for as long as you can as this seems to calm the pain too. (After the first 10 minutes or so the pain goes so it's just a case of getting through that part) Very important - make sure the cap fits really snug. The nurse who fitted mine the first time put on an extra large and I could fit my hand up the back of it. Three weeks later I lost loads of my hair - mainly from the top of my head. Luckily I started with very thick hair so although it's thinned a lot I can get away with it. The next time they used a medium one and I've hardly lost any since. If you have long hair have it cut shorter before you start. I didn't do this straight away and this caused me lots of problems - the main one being that once some hair started falling out it would get tangled up with the bottom of the rest of my hair while I was asleep. I would then wake up with matted hair like dreadlocks at the back of my neck and trying to comb out the knots - no matter how gently I tried with a wide toothed comb - just dragged more hair out. In the end I had it cut to a jaw length bob and its been much easier to manage with hardly any combing required - wish I'd done it earlier! Treat your hair gently - wash it as little as you can and use shampoo and conditioner that uses only natural products. Aveda do some or Body Shop have some nice ones which are less pricey and smell lovely. Only use a wide toothed comb or gently use a tangle teaser. Don't use a hairdryer/ straighteners etc as this can weaken the hair/ pull at it. I'm now half way through my treatment and have enough hair to get away with it, so I'd definitely recommend to people to give it a go if they want to. Hope this is useful :-)",

      "Content": "Hi Judith As far as I know the cold cap's been around a while but used to only be available for private patients. The ones in the hospital I go to, (The  Christie in Manchester), are currently only offered to the breast cancer patients as they are funded by a breast cancer charity called \"Walk the Walk\". Biggest downside is the timing - unfortunately you have to wear it for ages!!! First they spray your hair with water and then they slap conditioner on your hair.  You need to have it on for half an hour before they start administering your chemo, all the way through your chemo, and for a couple of hours after your chemo has finished being fed through so it adds a lot of time to your appointment which is frustrating. When they turn the machine that cools the cap off you then have to wait about ten minutes for it to defrost a bit before you can take it off your head as well. Other thing I should have mentioned on my initial info is that the cap covers your ears a bit. This can make the tops of your ears freeze and go sore. I tried putting some cotton wool over them but it got soggy and then icy which defeated the object! I'm wondering about trying to put a bit of vaseline on them next time to protect them a bit. Will let you know if it works!! I saw a rep from a company who are developing a better system when I was last having my treatment and apparently they are looking at one which will shrink fit to your head, won't be as cold and won't be on as long but it's not available yet :-( I know it all sounds a nightmare and it's not surprising that most people give up after the first try - particularly as they've probably lost some hair by the time they go for their second chemo - but I reckon if it helps you to keep enough to feel ok then it's worth the effort. No pain no gain eh! Hope you don't end up needing the chemo. Good luck with everything xx",

      "Content": "Hi Andrea I've had all six chemo sessions now. I lost a heck of a lot of hair in the end - mostly from the top of my head - but have kept enough, including the hair along my hairline, to put my cropped bob into a tiny ponytail that almost could be classed as a comb over!! I reckon my disastrous experience with the first session messed it up for me. My friend has been having chemo sessions the same days as me. She started with much finer hair than me which was shorter than mine - hers just touched her shoulders mine started off a lot longer. She reckons it's thinned a bit but you can't tell at all. Her hair looks exactly the same as before the treatment.  One of the breast care nurses said to me of the patients she's worked with who tried it about a third lost most of their hair, a third had some patches of significant thinning which they covered over and the other third just thinned a bit and you couldn't really notice. I would say maybe try it our for a couple of sessions and see how it goes/ how you feel. When my hair first started falling out I was very upset but now I couldn't care less about it. You get used to what's happening I suppose. I did buy a wig right at the start. I found a lovely one which was dearer than getting the prescription ones - about £90 - but was so close to my original style that I felt ok with it and I've recently worn it out a few times and felt quite normal. I felt much better knowing I had the wig as a back up. Having said all this, another pal of mine just decided to whack her locks off and wear scarves. She finished treatment a few weeks ago and her hair's starting to grow back now. It's each to their own in the end. I hung on to my lashes and brows until session 5. Since then they've thinned, but I got a great eyebrow pencil in my goodie bag at the \"Look good feel better\" session at the hospital which I've been using and my pals have all been fooled by it. It's possibly worked better as I've kept some of my own too. If they offer the make up sessions near you - it's funded by big beauty brands and they cover most hospitals where cancer treatment is offered - then I would definitely recommend them. I've always been a fan of wearing make up anyway, but I must say these days I look a million times better with a bit of slap on. You get a free goodie bag to take home with around £100 of products in it. The brands include ones like Clinique and Estee Lauder so it's decent stuff and definitely worth the effort of going along. Good luck with everything - let me know how you get on! Cathy x",

      "Content": "Hi Ive copied and pasted some info below from a post  I put on here in September which you may find useful. Since then I've finished my chemo, (last one was in October), and had a mastectomy and lymph gland removed in November. I started this journey with two rather big tumors in my right breast and the cancer was present in 3 lymph glands. By the time they did the mastectomy I had no - yes no!!!! - traces of any cancerous cells in the biopsy and so avoided the need for radiotherapy. I am having Herceptin injections every 3 weeks for the next few months. I now have a ridiculous hairstyle and lopsided breasts, (getting a lift on the other side in a few months), but am back in work and doing ok. Cathy x I signed up for a research trial that is looking at changes of diet and the impact of this re chemo side effects. The diet they put me on was high protein low carbs all the time with no carbs at all for the two days before your chemo. I found doing it all the time very hard as I dont eat meat so was having to eat fish and eggs every day as part of my diet to get enough protein. In the end I had to adapt it as it was stressing me out. The one thing I chose to stick to religiously was the no carbs for two days prior to chemo each time. What I will can tell you is this - I know four other people all at a similar stage in their treatment as me. One is on the same trial as me and has stuck with it, the others are not on the trial and eating whatever they fancy. Both myself and my friend who is on the trial haven't suffered half as much as the others with side effects. With the FEC the only side effects I had were constipation and manageable headaches from 2 days after chemo which lasted about 3 days. After that lifted I was like \"normal\" again. My mouth was fine and taste didn't really change. The Docetaxel has hit me harder - got pain in my back from 3rd day after chemo and it's lasted about 3 or 4 days. First time the pain was quite bad. Second time I took stronger co codamol and that sorted it. My mouth has gone a bit numb with it and my taste is funny on and off. The other girl on the trial has faired better than me on the Docetaxel. She has just had a bit of a headache for a few days with it. Other people I know not on the trial seem to have been knocked out for several days on both the FEC and the Docetaxel. Their taste went off from their first FEC and they have felt more tired than me throughout. I am no doctor and can only speak from the experience of those I know, but the people doing the research have said that there have been previous studies that have looked at the no carbs thing. Supposedly if you have no carbs for 48 hours you use up your natural carbs store in your body. They think that carbs in your body hang on to toxins including the toxins from the chemo. Going into chemo with no carbs in your body should therefor mean that the toxins don't hang around as much. I don't know if me and my pal have done better than others because of this or not - maybe our bodies went into it stronger?? - but I've stuck to it all the same just in case. It takes a lot of planning to avoid the carbs - your veg and fruit is very restricted because they contain carbs. You can have most green veg as they are low carb and fruits wise you can only have low carb ones like strawberries (7 strawberries is your fruit portion for the day). You also have to drink lots of water and have extra salt as you can get dehydrated. I do things like salmon cooked in soy sauce with celery, green pepper, ginger and chillies which is quite yummy. I also prep some soup using allowed veg and things like chick peas. Hope this is helpful. Good luck with everything everyone!! Cathy :-).",

      "Content": "Hi folks - yes it was the B AHEAD 2 study. We were split into two groups - one where they were on a low calorie diet all the time and the other, (which I was on), on the low carb high protein 5 days a week and then two days a week with pretty much no carbs. The idea is that the two days you cut out carbs fall directly before your chemo days. I didn't stick to this as rigidly as my pal and I didn't always do the two days every week, but I did keep to it religiously on the two days before my chemo every time. Being on the study has also made me rethink my diet as a whole. I've definitely got a better balance of the different food groups now - although I still enjoy the odd cake!!!  I had a look at the leaflet mentioned in another post. The principle is the same, but on the restricted days the amounts of things like milk were more limited. I've pasted some more info below from a previous post which outlines some of the food plan........ I will try my best to give as much info as poss - the whole thing is in a booklet so forgive me for not listing everything. You're supposed to try to have about 6 or 7 portions of protein a day on the restricted days. Do you eat eggs? If so they are on the 2 restricted days list. Quorn is ok too - I'm not keen so that limited my options! You can have skimmed or semi skimmed milk - limit to 1/3 pint each day. You can have a low fat yoghurt or fromage frais each day too. Hard cheese is a no no but you can have low fat soft cheese or cottage cheese in small amounts. You can also have a small amount of tofu. Fruits are very restricted as I've mentioned - most aren't allowed. You are only allowed one fruit \"portion\" each day. The fruits you can have are blackberries/ blueberries/ strawberries or you can have a thin slice of pineapple or melon. No apples/ pears/ bananas etc as they are higher in carbs. Veg that is okay includes: tomatoes, mushrooms, celery, spinach, french beans, asparagus, watercress, baby sweetcorn, green pepper (not other colours), cucumber, brocolli, lettuce, cauliflower, spring onions, courgettes, cabbage, mange tout, bean sprouts, aubergine and leeks. Flavouring-wise you can have things like herbs, chilli, balsamic vinegar, worcester sauce, garlic, ginger, soy sauce, lemon and lime juice, veg stock, You can have a little bit of low fat mayonnaise too. You can also use olive oil for cooking. Snacks can be hummus with crudites such as the baby sweetcorn or celery. You can munch on nuts such as cashews, pistachios, walnuts or hazelnuts too - one portion a day. You can have olives too. I sometimes do baked courgettes - I scrape the middle out and fill it with a mixture of creamy cheese, garlic and spring onion and bake it which is quite yummy. You have to use artificial sweeteners. You can have diet drinks - as much as you want - such as diet coke or flavoured sparkling water but not fruit juice. I tend to plan ahead and work out what I'm going to have for my three meals each day beforehand to make it easier to manage. For breakfast I usually have a mushroom and tomato omelette or my portion of fruit with yoghurt. I also use the stock and allowed veg to make some soup and keep it in the fridge. Little tip - if your taste goes funny with the chemo try things with mild flavours until it calms down again. I assumed that strong flavours would be better thinking I would be able to taste spicier stuff. Have tested this out several times but it always turns out to taste yucky! My friend and I have been sharing tips for this. Yoghurts and veg soups work for me during this time. I've been making a nice veggie soup with butternut squash, onion, carrot, drained chickpeas and drained red lentils with veg stock. It won't do for the restricted days but still fits to the diet list for the other ones. Or leek and potato also tends to taste ok.  Hope this is all of use to you everyone. Big hugs Cathy xxx",

      "Content": "Hi I know what you mean about the pain - I kept saying after my first lot that I felt like I'd been run over! I had pain across the back of my shoulders and all down my back. The soles of my feet felt very sore and ached as well. I had some co codamol which I took the first time but it hardly touched it. After that I spoke to the oncologist and they gave me a prescription for a much stronger dose of co codamol for the second lot which totally sorted out the pain issue - the oncologist had said if it didn't they would try tramadol but I didn't need it. Took the co codamol for four days. It made me sleep a lot but I didn't care. I was fine by the 6th day after my chemo. Just had my third lot. Only needed the co codamol for a day this time then the pain subsided. The main issue I have had this time is a dodgy tummy. My tummy has felt uncomfortable and full for over a week and I ended up only being able to eat yoghurt for four days cos I couldn't face anything else. Went to the doctors yesterday and they gave me something to settle it and I've managed to eat a few bits today and am starting to feel much better. Thankfully my chemo has now finished - YAY!! Just got my mastectomy to face in November.  Roll on next year eh folks. Hope you're feeling better soon Cathy x",

Weirdly my new hair has already started to come through and it has been growing quite fast, (2 cm long already!!!). I went into my local Holland and Barrett store today and had a long chat with one of the staff. She recommended I try some natural shampoo - Australian organics intensive care shampoo which has no synthetic fragrances/ colours/ parabens. One of the ingredients is rosemary which she said helps to maintain healthy follicles and promotes hair growth.  She also recommended that I try taking Biotin - which is a supplement for maintaining healthy skin and hair. I bought some but have come home and seen varying reports about it on the internet - some saying it can give you acne and even make your hair fall out!!! Also, I'm not sure if I'm ok taking supplements while still having Herceptin. Anyone tried it or anything else that actually helped???? Cathy :-)",

I used it all the way through and kept the bottom layer of my hair and some bits along my hair line at the front - just lost all the top!!! Finished my chemo in October - 3 lots of FEC followed by 3 lots of Docetaxol. I started to get a few wispy bits of hair back after my 5th lot of chemo but not much at all. My sister told me she'd read that rosemary oil is supposed to help with hair growth. When I told my pal she said a friend who lost her hair due to stress had found a shampoo that was helping after months of trying other things. She said it has rosemary oil in it. I went into Holland and Barratt and had a long chat with one of the assistants. I bought a shampoo and conditioner from a range called Australian Organics. It's supposed to be for dry/ coloured hair and doesn't mention anything about hair loss on the bottle but it does have rosemary oil in it. I've been using it for about 8 weeks now and, although defying gravity, I now have quite thick silky hair where my bald patch was. It varies in length from about an 1/2 an inch to 2 inches. Can't swear that this is down to the products I bought, but I reckon it may be worth a try. Cathy xx PS In case anyone's interested.....I've even risked dying it as I couldn't stand the idea of being grey as well as having no eyebrows!!

With the FEC the only side effects I had were constipation and manageable headaches from 2 days after chemo which lasted about 3 days. After that lifted I was like \"normal\" again. My mouth was fine and taste didn't really change. The Docetaxel has hit me harder - got pain in my back from 3rd day after chemo and it's lasted about 3 or 4 days. First time the pain was quite bad. Second time I took stronger co codamol and that sorted it. My mouth has gone a bit numb with it and my taste is funny on and off. The other girl on the trial has faired better than me on the Docetaxel. She has just had a bit of a headache for a few days with it. Other people I know not on the trial seem to have been knocked out for several days on both the FEC and the Docetaxel. Their taste went off from their first FEC and they have felt more tired than me throughout. I am no doctor and can only speak from the experience of those I know, but the people doing the research have said that there have been previous studies that have looked at the no carbs thing. Supposedly if you have no carbs for 48 hours you use up your natural carbs store in your body. They think that carbs in your body hang on to toxins including the toxins from the chemo. Going into chemo with no carbs in your body should therefor mean that the toxins don't hang around as much. I don't know if me and my pal have done better than others because of this or not - maybe our bodies went into it stronger?? - but I've stuck to it all the same just in case. It takes a lot of planning to avoid the carbs - your veg and fruit is very restricted because they contain carbs. You can have most green veg as they are low carb and fruits wise you can only have low carb ones like strawberries (7 strawberries is your fruit portion for the day). You also have to drink lots of water and have extra salt as you can get dehydrated. I do things like salmon cooked in soy sauce with celery, green pepper, ginger and chillies which is quite yummy. I also prep some soup using allowed veg and things like chick peas. Hope this is helpful. Good luck with everything everyone!! Cathy :-).",

Hopefully the diet thing will help you along the way. I'm a headteacher at an Infant school and was very put out when I got my diagnosis and they said that I couldn't go into school once my treatment started - a school is classed as a high risk environment as far as the risk of infection goes. I have, however, got an arrangement with work that I sign myself in on the weeks I feel up to it and work from home. I've only officially signed myself back in on the third week each time as that week I feel I can focus for a full working day, but I tend to manage to do quite a bit on the second week too. Good luck with everything  Cathy xx",

      "Content": "Hi Anna I will try my best to give as much info as poss - the whole thing is in a booklet so forgive me for not listing everything. You're supposed to try to have about 6 or 7 portions of protein a day on the restricted days. Do you eat eggs? If so they are on the 2 restricted days list. Quorn is ok too - I'm not keen so that limited my options! You can have skimmed or semi skimmed milk - limit to 1/3 pint each day. You can have a low fat yoghurt or fromage frais each day too. Hard cheese is a no no but you can have low fat soft cheese or cottage cheese in small amounts. You can also have a small amount of tofu. Fruits are very restricted as I've mentioned - most aren't allowed. You are only allowed one fruit \"portion\" each day. The fruits you can have are blackberries/ blueberries/ strawberries or you can have a thin slice of pineapple or melon. No apples/ pears/ bananas etc as they are higher in carbs. Veg that is okay includes: tomatoes, mushrooms, celery, spinach, french beans, asparagus, watercress, baby sweetcorn, green pepper (not other colours), cucumber, brocolli, lettuce, cauliflower, spring onions, courgettes, cabbage, mange tout, bean sprouts, aubergine and leeks. Flavouring-wise you can have things like herbs, chilli, balsamic vinegar, worcester sauce, garlic, ginger, soy sauce, lemon and lime juice, veg stock, You can have a little bit of low fat mayonnaise too. You can also use olive oil for cooking. Snacks can be hummus with crudites such as the baby sweetcorn or celery. You can munch on nuts such as cashews, pistachios, walnuts or hazelnuts too - one portion a day. You can have olives too. I sometimes do baked courgettes - I scrape the middle out and fill it with a mixture of creamy cheese, garlic and spring onion and bake it which is quite yummy. You have to use artificial sweeteners. You can have diet drinks - as much as you want - such as diet coke or flavoured sparkling water but not fruit juice. I tend to plan ahead and work out what I'm going to have for my three meals each day beforehand to make it easier to manage. For breakfast I usually have a mushroom and tomato omelette or my portion of fruit with yoghurt. I also use the stock and allowed veg to make some soup and keep it in the fridge. Little tip - if your taste goes funny with the chemo try things with mild flavours until it calms down again. I assumed that strong flavours would be better thinking I would be able to taste spicier stuff. Have tested this out several times but it always turns out to taste yucky! My friend and I have been sharing tips for this. Yoghurts and veg soups work for me during this time. I've been making a nice veggie soup with butternut squash, onion, carrot, drained chickpeas and drained red lentils with veg stock. It won't do for the restricted days but still fits to the diet list for the other ones. Or leek and potato also tends to taste ok.  Keep me posted how you get on - good luck! Cathy x",

      "Content": "Hi Andrea The idea is that you have limited carbs 5 days a week and then two days a week you try to go carb free - or as near as poss. The two days are supposed to be timed so that on the week you have chemo they fall directly before it. For example, my chemo was a Tuesday morning, so I did my two restricted days on a Sunday and Monday. To be honest I didn't stick to it quite the way I was supposed to, but I did do my two restricted days before every chemo session. Can't swear that this was what made a difference, maybe I was just lucky, but I guess anything's worth a try! Let me know how you get on. Cathy xx",

      "Content": "Hi Dawn I live in Manchester and am under the Genesis Centre at Wythenshawe hospital for my scans and surgery and The Christie for my Chemo. I was signed up for the trial through Wythenshawe - its called B-AHEAD. Not sure if they're doing it anywhere else. It's being run by a group of dieticians.  We were split into 2 groups for the trial and didn't get to choose what group we were in. The group I'm in is the no carb/ low carb one. If you do it strictly you do high protein low carb for 5 days and no carbs for two every week ensuring the two no carb fall directly before chemo. So if your chemo is on a Tuesday, you do no carbs every Sunday Monday. I've just done it on the two that fall before my chemo rather than every week. I must admit it has made me realise how low in protein my diet was before my diagnosis so I have shifted my diet to ensure I have more and have cut down on bread/ pasta and other carbs. The other group were on a calorie controlled diet throughout i think but I'm not sure how that one worked. As well as looking at whether it helps with the chemo side effects they are also looking at whether it helps you to stay at a healthy weight - they reckon slim people like me tend to put weight on during their treatment - and keep a good ratio of body fat to muscle. My weight has stayed around the same, occasionally dropping a couple of pounds if anything. Hope this helps and good luck with the op - same day as my last chemo, I'll be thinking of you!! Cathy x",

I am a single parent and won't be able to pay my mortgage if my income drops that much. I approached the bank to request having a 12 month freeze on my mortgage which I had thought was an option but got told that this is only available for certain mortgage deals - and unfortunately mine doesn't fit the bill. To take the pressure off I am considering selling up and buying a smaller, cheaper property instead. I have quite a bit of equity on my house so this could be a good option for me. Not convinced now I've read all this that I'll be able to sort out a new mortgage though! I've arranged to see an independent mortgage adviser for advice next Friday - will let you know how I get on.

      "Content": "Hi Re the Nail Varnish issue - I can answer it!! You need to put black or very dark nail varnish on your finger and toe nails if you are having Docetaxol. You don't need to do it for the FEC. You are also advised to keep your nails fairly short. They ask you to do this as there is something in the chemo can cause your nails to break or lift - they can fall off altogether apparently. They've found that putting dark nail varnish on seems to protect them. I've done it for my three doses of this chemo and my nails have been fine. With regards to the wig issue - I opted to try the cold cap (you can see my experience of this in a previous discussion on here). I got a wig in advance just in case I needed it. I ended up losing quite a bit of hair (see my comments on the discussion to find out why!) but a friend of mine who's done it and has just finished her 6th chemo session like me hasn't lost any. I have a bit of a comb over at the moment and at home or with friends I'm not bothered by it. I have pulled the wig out for my odd trip out tho and have found I feel a lot more comfortable wearing it than I expected. I got one that was similar to my original hair colour and style which I think has helped. I was offered a free one at the wig place in the hospital with the prescription they gave me but wasn't keen on any - although they did have lovely scarves and someone to show you how to tie them. I ended up getting one from a specialist shop but it was fairly reasonably priced and great quality - you get the VAT back too. I think knowing you've got one just in case as a back up helps, at least it did for me. I use Sanex zero deoderant which has no minerals in it and was recommended by the oncologist and natural body washes and creams from either Body Shop or the Rituals range in John Lewis. I found that as long as I drank pure pineapple juice occasionally and kept to a mild toothpaste my mouth was ok. I use Colgate pro sensitive toothpaste - and a soft toothbrush like the others have said. Good luck and follow what your body tells you. Big hugs  Cathy xx",

      "Content": "Hi Sharon I  had the two options you're considering offered to me too. I also ended up going on here and asking for advice. In the end I opted not to use the back tissue and just go for an expandable implant. The reasons I went against the back tissue option were as follows:- The surgery would be more extensive and I would have been in hospital for a week rather than just overnight by sticking to the implant on its own I was worried about the recovery. I wondered how I would manage to get comfy after surgery on my back and front. I was worried about possible long term problems with my back - although a lot of people on here said they'd been okay after it. I work with young children and the job can be quite physically demanding - I spend a lot of time bending down/ sitting on tiny chairs etc. Due to my job I've had some back problems in the past and didn't want to cause other complications. I know someone who had the op using her back tissue 4 years ago and, although she's been happy with the results, she said that she still feels a tightness in her back which restricts her movement when she goes to bend down to pick something up or do certain household chores. With regards to the option I chose ... I had my mastectomy in November and the implant was put in at the same time with a pig skin \"hammock\" to support it in place. The pain relief I was given proved to be very effective and I left the hospital the next day. I stopped taking the co codamol after a couple of days as it gave me tummy troubles and just managed on paracetamol from then on. I had a drain fitted to the centre of my chest with a bag attached to catch the fluid. This starts off quite bloody but goes clearer after a bit so don't panic when this happens!! I had a second drain fitted under my arm as I also had a lymph gland removed. This drain was removed after a couple of days but the one in the centre of my chest was left in for a fortnight to drain as much fluid as possible. This didn't bother me too much at first - possibly due to my chest being a bit swollen from the fluid. As it drained more it became quite uncomfortable but I now know it was worth persevering as getting rid of all the fluid helps your skin to sit back snuggly against your chest wall.  I had the dressing removed after two weeks and was pleasantly surprised with how the wound looked. I thought I'd be freaked out by the non existent nipple but I wasn't. The scar was one neat line in a diagonal direction across my bust. The stitches were dissolving ones and disappeared later leaving a flat line rather than a puckered one. Since then I have had some saline added three times - each time a few weeks apart to allow my skin to stretch slowly. This isn't painful at all - possibly as they've removed everything natural inside. They put a needle through the \"button\" on the side and feed it in with a syringe.  One thing I didn't expect was how thick the button was. It's about the size of a 5p coin and about three or four coins deep. It needs to sit just below the skin so they can find it to add the fluid but mine sticks out quite a bit so if I'm wearing a sleeveless top you can see it just in front of my armpit. I'm very conscious of this and it gets in the way a bit when I'm shaving there - yes the hair returns folks!!!! I've discussed this with my consultant and explained that surprisingly the protruding button is bothering me more than the lack of nipple. He has said that most people leave it as it is but explained that it is possible to remove it whilst leaving the implant intact.  I've decided to have a lift on the other side. Left this at first as I'm fairly small busted and wanted to see how things settled but the new one sits noticeably higher than the other and I'm struggling to find bras that fit right so I've decided that's what I want to do. I'm going to wait until about May to give my body a rest first. They've suggested that I wait to have the button removed. They will remove it when I have the lift as they will be able to use it to add/ take out fluid to get the best match when they operate on the other side and then take it off.  Sorry this is such a long response - I just know that it often helps to be told as much as poss about what to expect. Hope it proves to be useful and good luck. Cathy xx",

First one turned out to be a disaster as they put an extra large one on and third week after my hair starting falling out like mad. I had long hair at the time and the hair that was coming out was getting all matted in with my other hair at the back of my neck during the night so I was waking up with dreadlocks in the ends. I ended up going to the hairdresser and having it cut into a short bob which I thought would be traumatic but ended up being a relief. No more tangle!! Since then I've had a medium cold cap and although my hair has continued to thin a bit its not been that much really. If you opt not to shave everything off yet, I was told to only use luke warm water to wash my hair and strictly no hair dryer/ straighteners. I was also told to only use shampoo etc that was 100% natural products. You can get nice ones from body shop - they do a natural range that isn't too dear and they often do a three for two.  Hope this helps Good Luck Cathy",

I've done a couple of long weekends which I've really enjoyed but stuck to the UK and checked where the nearest hospital was before I went!! If you go abroad there's a couple of things to bear in mind - your travel insurance under the circumstances will probably be high and the journey/ different food/ different water etc could make you more prone to infection. My consultant told me that air conditioning systems can pump out germs so I've avoided putting it on in the car over the summer. If you have a bank account which gives you benefits such as travel insurance and car breakdown cover for a small charge each month then you need to know that if you have health issues such as cancer you need to let them know before you travel. They will still cover you but will increase the monthly charge - it will probably work out cheaper than doing travel insurance on its own though. Hope this helps Cathy :-)",

      "Content": "Hi Just saw your message. I work as a Headteacher, not in the NHS, so can only advise from what I know working for the local authority. I'm still undergoing treatment at the mo so not back at work yet - but I can comment about when I've had to deal with similar things as a manager. When someone has been off on several occasions or over a period of time I have to meet with them for a health review and we discuss a monitoring period of 3 months after which we will meet again. The purpose of a health review is to ensure that the person who has been off is getting the support they need to help them to be in good health and in work. If the person is off during the 3 months leading up to the next review - either for a related illness or something else - they don't get disciplined for it (unless they're skiving which is completely different!!). The idea is that the review allows the member of staff and employer the opportunity to review the support in place and see if anything else needs to be done - such as an extended phased return. What would happen then is that another health review is arranged to see how that's going. You can't be punished for not being able to guarantee that you won't be off in the next three months - no one can predict that. They may refer to it as a target but that's a target you and your employer are supposed to be aiming at together. Sometimes the wording throws you a bit but it's a two way thing. What you could do is ask to be seen by Occupational Health and you can go through with them about the ongoing effects of the drugs you're on. Sometimes it helps for an employee to have a medical person confirming the difficulties they are still dealing with. You could also ask them to refer you for some counselling as part of your support package to deal with the emotional side of things. Don't feel that you can't ask - I've always been happy to provide support like that or arrange physio through work for people. It makes sense to me as an employer as people are more likely to recover well if they are looked after in the right way - in the long term it makes sense. Hope this helps and good luck Cathy :-)",

At the end of the day I think it's up to the individual what they decide is right for them but it may offer a bit of encouragement. I've just had the last of six sessions of chemo - 3 FEC and 3 Docetaxol and Herceptin, every 3 weeks with Herceptin to follow every few weeks for a year. The side effects have varied from session to session. I always felt ok for the first couple of days while the steroids are in my system and then have felt off for anything from one or two days to a week. Side effects have included constipation/ dodgy tummy, pains in my shoulders, back or feet and headaches but all have been tolerable with prescribed medication. In the end I decided to look at it this way - I feel well more days than I feel poorly each time. Don't get me wrong, I have had days where I've felt fed up with the whole thing but seeing my scan results (see previous discussion) really helped to spur me on. Hope this helps in some way - difficult decision whatever you choose. Big hugs Cathy x",

      "Content": "Hi there everyone A friend of mine and I were diagnosed with breast cancer this May. We were both in our forties. I went to my GP and got referred for a mammogram after I discovered a lump when I was checking myself, my friend found a spot of blood in her bra and then got referred for a mammogram. By the time I spotted my lump it was a significant size - 3cm - and they also found a second lump on a scan and traces in my glands. Thank God I spotted it when I did! I know that some health authorities in the UK have brought the age for routine mammograms down, however in my local area the age is still set at 50. in America they offer free mammograms for women in their forties. I've also read a study done in the USA that says 50% of deaths from breast cancer were women in their forties who hadn't been sent for a routine mammogram. I am interested to know what other peoples thoughts are - might even set up a campaign!!! Let me know what you think. Cathy :-)",

      "Content": "Hi Don't know if this works for everyone but my pal and I have found that if we eat things with a mild taste and softer texture until the taste thing starts to settle back down. At first I assumed that I needed to make things with a lot of taste to them and made some spicy meals but this turned out to be a bad idea. Don't know about your mum but I also found that I went off a lot of drinks - particularly coffee and tea. Best things that worked for me were things like yoghurts - keep clear of live ones tho, mild flavoured soups like leek and potato or butternut squash etc., omelettes etc. I drink lots of water to try to flush the toxins out. The only warm drink I can manage is my warm milk at bedtime - my pals having Horlicks at night (may have to buy her a bed jacket!!!!!) Hope this helps your mum Cathy x",
