    "Content": "Hi, I had my first course of Taxotere last Wed (18/08/10). I was ok until the Friday evening which was when the bone pains started, the only thing I can compare it to is when you trap your finger in the door. The pains got progressively worse over the weekend and nothing seemed to ease it. Thankfully by Tuesday evening it had worn down to fluey type aches. I have now got some tramadol in for my next course as another patient advised me that this is about the only painkiller that eases the pain to bearable. I have spoken to a number of patients/nurses etc and apparently the side effects do vary greatly from 1 to another so hopefully you will be fine. At the end of the day, however bad we feel whilst on the treatment, it is the bigger picture we must focus on. Treatment will hopefully cure us and give us many more years with our loved ones... This is what keeps me going. Good Luck xxxx",
