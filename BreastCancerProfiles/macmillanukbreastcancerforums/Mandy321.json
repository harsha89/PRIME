      "Content": "Hi can anyone help me or at least tell me I'm not going completely mad. After being diagnosed I think I just went into mum mode making sure everyone else was ok, husband, kids and all my family. Started treatment yesterday and have just kept crying. The cold cap was awful experience but loosing my hair I think would be far worst for me. They keep telling me to cut it shorter I've already had 10 inches off the length. Any tips on how I can make it more bearable. So tired and overwhelmed today and feel really sick.",
