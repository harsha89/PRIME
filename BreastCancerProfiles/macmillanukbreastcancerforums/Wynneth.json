      "Content": " Hi everyone I had a mastectomy four weeks ago, have developed a Seroma which is very swollen and tender from back, underarm and above wound around front to breastbone.  It's been drained twice, first time the nurse struggled a little to get the fluid out to start with, then it just kept flowing and flowing, so much so that she attached a drain bag.  She drained around 750mls of horrid looking dark brown fluid.  Surgeon said to drain again in ten days when I saw him after my mastectomy.  He also gave me the bad news that two out of three lymph nodes removed were positive and I'm to have axillarly clearance on 31 October.   Second time it was drained last Thursday) the nurse had a lot of problems getting much fluid out despite being very swollen, she called a colleague to help and between them them pummeled and massaged me and removed around 250mls, plus a layer of 'yukky' grey stuff floating on the top. Before the first nurse started the draining, when I showed her that the skin over the area of my wound was very red, tender to touch and felt really hot.  She called a doctor in to see it, she drew a pen line around the edge of the red area and told me to seek urgent medical care if the red spread past the line.  She prescribed antibiotics and said they'd send a sample of the fluid to the lab and when results came back they'd know if it was the right antibiotic or if I needed another type.   Since Thursday the Seroma has swelled again, its all hard and tender to touch in some parts.  All the red area is still the same, no improvement despite taking the antibiotics fir four days.  Plus I feel pretty rough in myself, totally exhausted and still in so much pain I'm still taking paracetamol and codeine every four hours to try and control the pain. I called the BC nurses this morning, my lab results weren't yet back, she told me to just keep taking all the meds and come to thus Thursday's drop in clinic and they'll check it. Has anyone else experienced this ?  I've quite worried about the redness, the swelling of the Seroma is very uncomfortable.  Just wondered if others had experienced anything like this and whether I should try to get further help or not. Hugs to all Wynneth X",

      "Content": "Hi all.  Just had an appoint with yet another consolutant (third) - apparently they are short of staff !   I was diagnosed with invasive lobular carcinoma in June after biopsies (1st consultant).  MRI following the diagnosis showed it had spread more than ultrasound showed and was told (2nd consultant) that the lumpectomy planned couldn't go ahead as I now needed a mastectomy and there was something in my other breast.  I had a holiday booked starting a few days after seeing him, and he advised me to go ahead and have a nice family time to rest and prepare for surgery.    Today's appointment (3rd consultant and different breast care nurse) after he had read my notes, offered me the choice of having chemo first, which may shrink the main tumour, although the MRI showed another nodule nearby so even if it shrank, I'd still need a mastectomy. Question to everyone, what would you do ?  I've opted for surgery first then chemo.  Anyone think I've made the wrong decision.  I'd love some help and advice on this  Hugs Wynneth ",

Hope your reconstruction recovery goes really well. Hugs Wynneth X",

      "Content": "Hi Karen I've been researching reconstructions and have decided I don't want to go through that either.  I've done a lot of online research of procedures, looked at lots of post op photographs of reconstructions and those who have chosen to go flat and just heal from the surgery.  Very brave ladies who have shared their pictures and experiences have given me the opportunity to know more about how I may look afterwards.  I was very shocked when looking at the first few pix, but I have continued to look to desensitise and help me come to terms with how my post op body will look.  I know everyone is different and their outcome will be different, but at least I feel more prepared. I understand how difficult you must find it occasionally when reality hits you all over again, I've had to come to terms with a very disfiguring scar after having my gallbladder removed a few years ago, but know a mastectomy is a whole different 'ball game'.   I gave the surgeon my decision yesterday and so far don't feel I want to change my mind, It still feels the right choice for me to have surgery first.  All the responses on here have helped me and I'm so very grateful to everyone for their advice.

      "Content": "Hi Kacang Thank you so. Much for your response.  It certainly feels like a scary rollercoaster ride that I never even wanted to be on ! The consultants i saw previously never once mentioned the option of chemo first, both talked of surgery followed by chemo and/radiotherapy, so i was confused and unsure when he spoke of the option to have chemo first when I saw him yesterday.   I know every doctor has their own methods and preferences but during the conversation with him I felt he started off very much in favour of chemo first but then suggested in my case surgery first might be better !  Plus, from the outset he said the final outcome would be no different whichever way the treatment started.   When we are vulnerable and in need of help, we turn to the 'experts' to give us the best advice in light of their experience and not to be expected to make the decision on which treatment plan is best to have ourselves.   I don't have a date for surgery yet as the papilloma in my other breast has to be removed by a process similar to the needle biopsies guided by ultrasound which I've already had on both breasts, but using a larger needle and vacuum suction.  The lab results of the biopsies done on my other breast were clear of cancer, but they need to remove and test the papilloma so will do the removal procedure and tissue tests before the mastectomy is scheduled.  So I'm guessing I'll have at least five to six more weeks to wait for the surgery, sigh.

      "Content": "Hi lamg Thanks so much for responding to my question.  I really appreciate it. So fantastic to hear you are cancer free my dear, I do understand that this was the absolutely right decision for you to have the chemo first.  They don't consider my cancer is fast growing and the second consultant I saw told me it had likely been growing for about 18 months up to three years !   As I'd had a clear mammogram in January this year, my initial fear when noticing the lump was that it had grown very fast if I was clear in January then had a sizeable lump by end of April !   However this is not the case, invasive lobular cancer is very sneaky and 'hides' and doesn't show on mammograms, although it was clear on the ultrasound, but it's full size and extent of spread was only seen on the MRI.  It has been sneakily growing and spreading for some time until I noticed a soft swelling on the top of my breast and a very slight change to my nipple.  Ultrasound hasn't shown anything in lymph nodes, but of course they will remove at least sentinel nodes, if not more, during the mastectomy and test them for cancer cells. All this is what has formed my decision to go for surgery first and then blast everything with chemo just in case stray cells have spread, although it's my understanding that if there is no cancer in the lymph nodes, it's unlikely to have spread.   This forum is wonderful, I've only just joined but have already been helped tremendously by everyone, I really appreciate it.

I'm with you on not caring what anyone else thinks, they don't have to look if it offends or upsets them do they ?

My lymphnodes appeared clear on ultrasound, but of course they will biopsy sentinel nodes and possibly others during the surgery and I will know for sure if it has spread to them after the lab tests. I wish you all the best for your chemo my dear and subsequent treatment plan, hope It all works out well for you, thinking of you. Hugs Wynneth X",

Thank you for sharing your own story, I'm sorry things didn't work out so well for you and that you've still to go through further surgery, hoping it hasn't spread and your lymph node surgery goes well huni.   Your last paragraph says just what I'm thinking, I don't want this evil thing inside me for a moment longer than is necessary, I just can't take the worry of leaving it and trying chemo first which may or may not shrink it, knowing that the outcome will be a mastectomy regardless, but at a much later date.  Plus my body will be damaged by chemo before I undergo surgery rather than having it whilst I'm strong and healthy.
