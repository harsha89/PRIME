    "Content": "Hi, this is my first message.  My mum is 75 and lives in Spain.  She's recently been diagnosed with HER2, and she is having her first chemo session tomorrow (29 Apr). Her treatment plan is chemo, Herceptin and surgery.  Me and my sister are flying over as much as we can.  Does anyone have any experience of being treated in Spain?  Many thanks. Nicki",
