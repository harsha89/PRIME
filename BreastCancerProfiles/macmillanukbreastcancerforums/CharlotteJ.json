      "Content": "Hi Bev, I am definitely no expert in what you can and cant do but just in my opinion I don't see doing Slimming world to be a problem. I do this diet to lose weight myself & nothing on it would be inappropriate to eat whilst on chemo I don't believe. Just make sure with any fresh veg/fruit they are thoroughly washed and try to stay away from Eggs unless hard boiled. Other than that I cant see slimming world as a problem :) Im not sure about weight watchers as haven't ever looked at what people eat on that. Take care xx",

      "Content": "Hi All, Not sure if anyone will know or have any information on this but - Just wandered while having FEC how quickly/slowly your white cells reproduce and when you are at the least risk of catching infection? Do they build back up within the 21 days to their full potential? Or are they still low by the time the next chemotherapy comes round? If anyone could help with this would be really grateful :) Our oncologist has said between day 7 & day 17 the cells are rebuilding, but hasn't mentioned if they rebuild fully etc. Thank you! XxXxX",
