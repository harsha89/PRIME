      "Content": "After finding a lump in my breast the other day, I'm going to see my gp tomorrow. I know that he will put in a referral to the breast clinic. I had breast cancer 11 years ago and had a mastectomy, chemo and radiotherapy and then medication for a few years.  The rational part of my brain says this time it might not be anything but the paranoid side has already crossed all the bridges and I'm reliving in my head what happened the last time.  I was also diagnosed with heart problems just over a month ago.  I'm feeling really nervous tonight - any suggestions on how to cope would be really helpful.  I'm new to this site and I've never posted anything to a group before - hope I've done it right!",

Tried to get back to sleep and now I just feel I'm back to square one - think I've got myself a bit wound up.  It feels like groundhog day.  All these different emotions.  I've got a friend coming over later which I'm sure will help.  Sorry for this rant - just needed to do it xxx",

I've already been on to the helpline and spoken to a support person and a nurse.  Finding it really hard to focus on anything other than the dread of the appointment on Wednesday. Feel I need to give myself a good talking to because I'm getting fed up listening to myself.  Sorry for the moan xx",
