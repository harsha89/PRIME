      "Content": "... especially with their reply. Researchers identify seven types of breast cancer for more accurate prognosis\" target=\"_blank\">Article link - Researchers identify seven types of breast cancer for more accurate prognosis\" target=\"_blank\">Researchers identify seven types of breast cancer for more accurate prognosis The article was published on their facebook page. The last section talked about what the research meant for women - 5 times 'women' were mentioned, not once were men mentioned. Does the research not work for men??? When I questioned whether Breast Cancer was now gender-specific, they began their reply with \" We focus on women in some topline wording on our website and other media because of the many more women diagnosed each year...\" To me that does not give the right message to the media - that men suffer from it too. We're only 400 out of many thousands per year, but cant afford to be forgotten or dismissed, especially by a Cancer Charity.  ",

I've had bi-lateral mastectomy (May this year) and axial node removal on rightside (June). My right arm is being measured/monitored in case of lymphoedema occurring, but  a chance mention about cellulitis a year ago in one of my legs got the doc to check my legs - he says I have lymphoedema in both, wasnt expecting that !         ",

      "Content": "My experience is similar to that described by George &Jackie. - I had surgery first then chemo (last one was last Monday!) then Radio booked to start 10 Jan The 3 docetaxol sessions did affect me, but I feel it was more to do with the course of 7 daily injections I had to have post-docetaxol - bone pains esp feet knees sometimes jaw & teeth, tiredness, odd taste in mouth and only being able to taste hot or spicy food and cold drinks ( beer & curry, mmm :-) ) Dose up on painkillers for the bone pain, use the mouthwash and cold pineapple ( easy on the pineapple cos it may affect your tongue ) and it will be bearable - it's only a few days.... As for Radio, I'm told to treat as above - cream to safeguard the skin and it should be ok... really I'm dreading the daily journey to hospital more than the radio :) Cheers Russ",

The oil is helping with the surgery scars. Didn't know about bottled water, will avoid that for a while. Luckily, the only real effects I've been having is a few days of bloatedness and a bit of constipation. Had a bit of a 'furry' tongue but cleaned that with toothbrush to help. Can't help with advice on wigs/scarves as I don't bother with them - stil not quite used to seeing my reflection witha bald head but would probably look a bit funnier if I did have a wig or a scarf I think :-) Got my 3rd chemo tomorrow, so going on last 2 sessions, next week is my 'Sick Week' - should be ok by next weekend Cheers, Russ",
