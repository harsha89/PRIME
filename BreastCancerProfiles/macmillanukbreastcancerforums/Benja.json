      "Content": "Dear Rebecca. I have had the same procedure as you, save I have to have chemo next. I know it is hard but if you look back on this site there has been discussions regarding voluntary mx. There was a quote, can't remember who said that they had been told by a surgeon if you had one bad leg, you would not take the other just in case. I think that this is a good point. None of us know why're got this and how long we have had it but we cannot, in my view,go having invasive surgery unnecessarily. I understand there might well be a higher chance of us getting it in the other breast but I personally would not choose this course. I am coping ok with losing one breast not sure if I would cope with the loss of both and especially if there was no medical reason. We all have personal choices to make and this is one for you. I would not however, choose this course. I am not sure that this is helpful but it is a view. Good luck with any decision you make. Benja x",

Just to let you know I suffered with this on Doxatacel  back in 2013 and also red hand and foot syndrome , my dosage was reduced on the last chemo. I still have some numbness in my fingers and toes but much better now. Just be careful when washing up, I broke glasses and plates galore and invested in a padding for the sink as I couldn't feel anything! Good excuse to get out of the washing up and buy new crockery!  It does get better. Good luck with your journey. Benja xx",

      "Content": "Hi Jenny I was petrified just before my MX on November 2nd, I took a week holiday with the hubby and kids and came back to the controversy of whether there was 'over treatment ' of breast cancer. I was ready to do a runner! I have to say that once I was there and following the MX and a node clearance as it had spread, I have no regrets. I have not missed my breast like I thought I would, in my mind I have had the disease cut out and those who have seen it have all remarked that it is better than they expected. Of course it is an emotional time, we have all had a good cry and it takes time to come to terms with it. We all deal in our own way . Focus on the positives and practicalities as you seem to. You will get through it and on this site there are lots of ladies who will help you along the way.we all have bad days,it's normal. Pogue-Mahone I am 12 days it would seem ahead of you. I had my first FEC on 18th December and second is next week. It is doable, just make sure you have the sickness tablet at least an hour before treatment ( they had not given me the tablet) and that you take all the anti sickness course they give to you. I had a rough night and was physically sick but then the nausea continued for a few days after and some mouth ulcers. That was it, so with some bonjella, a mouth wash from the hospital and ice cream it has been fine. Good luck to you both Benja xx",

      "Content": "Hi I had a joint critical illness with my hubbie which I claimed on, paid out within three months of diagnosis and was relatively straightforward. Just found out that it cancelled the policy for hubbie so just hastily arranged cover for him knowing that it can happen to anyone. An important lesson that I now expound to everyone. Also I was told I cannot have critical illness for at least five years and that there will be companies that now won't cover me at all, I expected cancer but not everything. I also had a policy through work I paid for my earnings which could be claimed after thirteen weeks , this is proving a little less straightforward to claim on and despite starting a claim in January am still battling to push it forward which is frustrating. It does take the pressure off to have some monies behind you as I have heard several horror stories of women having to work through this horrible journey and others who couldn't losing their houses in the process. I am glad that more luck than judgement I had the policies in place as they have given me piece of mind and I can concentrate on kicking this disease and taking back my life. Good luck with your journey but do claim, it's worth the piece of mind. Love Benja xxx",

I have just been on holiday and there are pics with me and a cleavage ( the last for quite a while as I am not able to have a reconstruction immediately either). I am struggling with this concept and even have been commenting to my husband 'last Saturday with two breasts, last Sunday etc' Poor man doesn't know what to say. Come Friday I will be the same as you and am not sure how I will cope ( although I am sure I will somehow). I have even thought of backing out of surgery, stupid perhaps but following the report in the news I had convinced myself I had options to avoid the surgery. I really feel for you and can only hope that you will become more positive although this will not be easy.

      "Content": "Hi. I have finished three FEC and have one Dosetaxal under my belt. I am due my second on Wednesday . I did not have any real side effects until two days after although all food tasted of nothing. I had the booster injection thursday afternoon and by Friday evening the effects started. I had taken painkillers (tramadol) in readiness but I have to say even taking the maximum did not touch the pain in my bones. It varies from a dull ache to shooting pains and sleep was not easy for a week. I also had an allergic reaction to the booster and swelled up in my face,lips and tongue. I thought this was normal but it is not! I ended up on antihistamine as well as nystan for oral thrush. The consultant did say that tramadol does not touch the pain in bones so gave me amitriptyline which did help. I did also develop red hand and foot syndrome on the Wednesday which was painful and my skin is now peeling off. I am on pyridoxine three times a day now until the end of my chemo. I also was recommended udder cream ( yes the stuff used for cows and I have had many jokes about it as you can imagine! ) luckily living in Somerset I was able to get it easily enough but it does seem to be helping. it sounds horrendous and for me has been worse than FEC but as has been said it is doable. Don't be put off by my posting, this is my experience only and doesn't happen to everyone. I posted so that you know the worst and what to look for, don't suffer the hospital can prescribe for all side effects and in my case reactions. Good luck to you all and hope you all have the least side effects. I will post at the weekend and let you know if it was different this time. Love Benja xx",

      "Content": "Hi Lucy-loo Had a rough day yesterday but not through the chemo! Saw the oncologist and I was told that I am border line for rads, which from diagnosis I have always been told was on the cards so was a shock. When I started questioning why turns out that it is a postcode lottery, there are no stats to look at for percentages for for and against for one to three nodes involved. I had my sentinel node only. They want me to be a fatalist and for a computer to decide whether I go on with rads or not. If I went to other NHS districts then they will give rads. Basically I received no guidance and was told they recommend no rads but there is no hard and fast rule why, it's just their way! It has been left as it is a gray area and I ghetto decide with no guidance. I was completely floored by the responses and felt very unsupported. There is no information to read as there are no stats available and I am to gamble. I have two fairly young children and my decisions effect them and my family. If it comes back will I not wonder what if? I was told I was discussed at the MDT meeting but when I went to look at my records was declined until I wrote in. Despite mine and many other files being left lying around o the floor and sides for all to see. The chemo was delayed did not get out until 6.45 pm as they were so far behind from a three o'clock app. taste buds are just going now so by tomorrow evening, if the same will be in bad with the pain. Glad to hear yours was not too bad also. Good you have Regress I am in limbo now and would welcome any thoughts. The family feel I should insist on rads which I can. Very confused. Wish you well too.

I also took a buy to let mortgage in April following mx and chemo and again not asked about my health. The mortgage comp were just interested in ability to pay! I was lucky as had insured my income through a work policy so I still receive 75% of my income which has been a life saver. I have travelled abroad three times on short haul as well. I took insure pink insurance prior to surgery and treatment to go to Turkey. I now have a year insurance with Staysure for multi trip worldwide cover. I am not covered for 'metastatic disease' but figure that I will not get Breast cancer whilst I am away that needs to be dealt with, I had it over 12 months before I was diagnosed last year. Not sure if this helps. With over insurance cover, I had a critical illness policy which paid out some monies but have been told that I cannot be covered again for another 5 years post treatment. I do however have life insurance in place which remains unchanged. It is confusing and upsetting. I tell everyone now to make sure they have insurance in place as it's so difficult to (a) get financial help as lots of the ladies are finding and you just don't need that on top of everything and (b) to get cover following the event. Good luck in your quest and let us know if you find any good insurance companies! Benja x",

      "Content": "Hi Whiskers, like you I read the posts but seldom post now. I have had very similar treatment to you, except just turned 46, I had a MX with node removal November 2012, chemo 6FEC-T, had bad time with T, to extent that was left with neuropathy and burnt out my thyroid. Had 15 rads and am on Tamoxifen. Have had tamoxifen stopped for month as suffering with breathlessness and if it turns out to be tamoxifen they may have to force me into an early menopause, which will have a load more problems and side effects on new medication. I am presently awaiting a date for my reconstruction hopefully end of September beginning of October which in turn I hope will make me feel more 'normal', whatever that is! I don't like having a skin saver in, whilst I appreciate that it's done its job (stretched the skin) it goes hard, puckers and I have the portacath to fill it protruding from my ribs which hurts with bras and gets sore/bruised. My husband does not see me naked, I hide away, I have put on weight, have thin/bald patches on my head ( recently highlighted when watching a video of swimming with dolphins, when I was focused on how my bald patches showed up!) and feel generally unattractive. I identify with what you are feeling, I too get frustrated. I am going into hospital Thursday to have my heart artificially 'speeded up' to check my arteries and blood tests for B12 deficiencies . I never went near doctors before all this started. My whole life turned upside down, I was a professional person, have not returned to my old job as I do not feel able to do it, am in leaving talks which have got protracted and have had to involve solicitors! I am however here, on the forum discussing with you the downs of the treatment but I do recognise lots of positives. I am alive, I sadly attended a friends funeral after he lost his battle with this horrid disease, on Friday. We have come out battle scarred the other side but no one perceives us as we see ourselves. Everyone likes my shorter, curly hair and don't see the bald patches. In clothes people can't tell I have one breast so strangers don't know ( unless my kids tell them, 'my mum only has one boob!' Which has been known, it breaks the ice) . I am not my old self but in some ways I am better, I am less stressed, see my kids/family/friends more, appreciate the smaller things in life that I didn't before. It's not easy and I too have down days but we have a new life and people who have stuck with us, will continue to, they may not understand, because they haven't been through it but they will support you. Meanwhile you can rant and rave on here with people who identify with you and understand. Please have the pain looked at by the experts, it will be worth it in the end. Keep strong and sending lots of cyber hugs. If you need to chat please contact me. Sorry I have rambled on but I felt it important for you to know you're not alone in what you are feeling, sometimes that can help. Benja xx",

Good luck with the TAX but don't suffer with the pain they can prescribe pain killers to ease it. There is enough to content with without suffering in silence. I have now finished my last one so good luck to you all there is light at the end of the tunnel. Benja x",

      "Content": "Hi, I am in a slightly different position from you. I have been on long term sick for two years since October 2012 and decided that I could not return to my previous employment due to the stress factors and amount of hours I was working. Handed my notice in September and have 6 months notice period which I won't work as still signed off and  awaiting reconstruction surgery on 15th December. I decided I would do something completely different and brought a business, totally different to what I have worked in for 27 years. It will allow me flexibility after my recovery from surgery and i am planning on developing an online side and planned parties etc. my point is could you do something from home that would allow you to work when you are able Or set up a little business? Do you have some skills ? Coming up to christmas you could make and sell some things whilst looking around? Whatever you do  I am sure it will be a success, good luck with your journey and your career choice. Benja x",

      "Content": "Hi I feel slightly different, in the beginning (September 2012) I felt numb, bemused and over whelmed by the whole process and the replacement of my life with hospital appointments and treatments. It was not until February 2013 that I turned my work phone off and have never switched it back on. The whole process has made me re evaluate my life and I realised that I was not enjoying my career and that I had no work life balance and was running to catch up the whole time. As a result I resigned from my employment in September ( having not returned) and am on my notice period. 27 years of my career so it was scary but I am so much happier. I still don't like that I am not me physically with all of the drug side effects but I have to say I am less stressed and spend lots of time with my kids which they probably have grown tired of LOL !  This is a positive for me and I try to concentrate on this rather than the other very much more negative effects that we all go through. Love to all on this very difficult and life changing roller coaster. Benja xx",

      "Content": "Dear D.Loung I am sorry that you find yourself on this site but you will find lots of support here. I was told that I had probably had cancer for over.a year when I had my diagnosis and it was small. It really depends on the type of cancer. You will know more once you have the results. At the moment you are imagining the worst which is understandable, you will have to deal with things as they arise and one step at a time. It is a long journey and you will need to support each other. Your mum will let you know how she wants the support, we all react differently. Right now enjoy each others company, the one thing that my journey has taught me is that you must live for now. Your mum will cope with the treatments with help from the professionals and from you all, it is doable but daunting now, it is the unknown. There are many more on this forum who will provide more wisdom than I but we are all here to help you. Don't suffer in silence and keep posting to,let us know the results and how you all are. The unfortunate symptom of cancer is that it has a ripple effect, it does not just effect the person who is going through the treatment. Wish you and your mother all the best and my fingers are crossed for good news for you all. Cyber hugs Benja x",
