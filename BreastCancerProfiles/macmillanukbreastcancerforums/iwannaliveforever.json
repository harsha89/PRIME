I am someone who likes to do my research, and it's frustrating when someone just spouts a bit of opinionated claptrap. I would love it if people just asked me questions (and some of my friends do) or just asked how I was feeling and were prepared to listen to the answer. I am lucky that I found this site early, and I come on here when I feel that no one else really gets it. As yet I have not really 'contributed', just asked questions and had a bit of a whinge, and everyone's been lovely.  I hope the rest of your treatment goes well, and that you and the cats make some good, new friends, as life returns to a new normal. With love Lizz X ",

Anyway, my onco told me I could have the portacath removed and I was delighted and went ahead. I noticed that everyone (nurse at the hospital, physiotherapist, blood test guy) all told me this was good news, but I was so desperate to be rid of it and get the scar tidied up, that I didn't give it much thought. Went to see my GP straight after it was removed and he asked if I'd had a blood test for 'markers' (not sure that's the English term?). Implications of this question hit me like a brick. (Background - surgery in April, Chemo June - August, Radio September and October. Last blood test during chemo, except for one to check I was okay for the removal procedure)  I've just had the blood test and wil get the results tomorrow, but can anyone tell me what to expect? If there are numbers, how do I interpret them? Will it just be negative (fingers crossed) or positive? I can apparently speak to a biologist at the lab, but anyone on here able to explain to me? Thanks a lot, in advance Love Lizz xxx",

      "Content": "Hi all, Just been to get my results (which I am happy to say are fine, according to the biologist I spoke to) so I thought I'd share what I learnt: CA125 - marker for breast cancer. Level should be below 35 U/l (mine was 12.5) CA 15-3 - ovarian cancer. Level should be below 25 U/l (me - 13.5 compared to 15.6 before lumpectomy - not sure why I had this test back in April UNLESS she misspoke when she said this marker was for ovarian cancer, and it should be the other way round?) CA19-9 - intestinal cancer (no idea why the GP ordered this) Level should be below 39U/l (me - 10.4) There is also an ACE marker which she didn't refer to but for smokers the level should be below 5.5 and for non-smokers below 3.8. (me - 1.1) On reflection, and reading what others have written here, I think perhaps these markers are not a very accurate indicator, but I still feel better for knowing that I haven't missed having a vital test, and that this one has come back okay.  Do women in the UK routinely get MRIs or bone scans after treatment? I has a scan before chemo, but now I'm on my own until my next check-up in April. Does that sound normal? Thank you all very much,  Lots of love Lizz xxx",

I am apparently a strong case for chemo now (oncotype test score 47) but I don't want to undergo such a radical treatment if it means that any future cancer would need to be treated even more aggressively, or even that I have used up all my options. I may be inventing a whole new scenario, but I read that you can't have radiotherapy on the same area twice: are there any arguments for saving the chemo big gun for a later day when / if there is a recurrence? I know I am desperately looking for arguments not to have chemo, or reassurances that I'm not ruling out future help. I've never particularly liked taking drugs, so chemo seems overwhelmingly counterintuitive. Thanks x",

My absolutely favourite place to visit is the Pont du Gard - about 30km from Avignon. You can swim in the river, there are sunny, and a few shady, places on the riverbank / beach, as well as the magnificent aqueduct. Plenty of walking trails. It will be very hot, but I think the car park is open from quite early in the morning till midnight or perhaps later. (It closes so that people can't stay there in their camper vans). I don't feel like I'm selling it very well, but it really is absolutely wonderful.  I have my next chemo on Friday, but if you wanted to go there on Sunday, say,  I'd be happy to come an meet you (and I should be okay on day 3, fingers crossed). On Sunday morning the covered market in Avignon is fantastic - if you're self-catering you could buy some lovely treats: best to get there early. Further afield is Uzès which has a lovely Provençal market in Saturday and Wednesday. Also, you could check out les carrières de lumière www.lesbauxdeprovence.com/.../16-carrieres-de-lumieres which is near les Baux de Provence - they have an exhibition (this year it's Chagall) using video projections in an old, enormous, limestone quarry. They animate some of the paintings, and in previous years (Cézanne was my favourite) it has been brilliant. It's also lovely and cool on a hot summer's day. I realise this wasn't what you wanted, but hey, maybe it'll be of some interest. Either way, have a lovely, lovely time. Lots of love Lizz xxx",

I teach adults but for one particular client the classes are held in a lycée and students (adult and pre-BAC) are not allowed to wear a scarf on school premises. I have kept my cancer completely secret from my employers (maybe wrongly, but that was the choice I made) so I don't know what to do when September comes. I have lost almost all my hair (I can tease a few strands out around the edges of a scarf or hat) and seem to be getting on reasonably well with scarves. I ordered a wig but it didn't suit me at all. I'm waiting for a second one to arrive, but I realised that one of the main reasons I was even considering a wig was for this particular work situation. I know I can (probably should) confide in my principal contact person, but even with her 'permission' (and the idea I'd need permission is galling) I can't prevent a disgruntled student challenging me. I had a student last year who tried to get away with wearing a scarf and was taken aside and rebuked - she is the kind of person I can well imagine not taking kindly to the teacher getting special privileges. I realise I could probably avoid some of the hassle by just being open, but instinctively since my diagnosis I have not wanted people to know because I imagine they will treat me differently. Any ideas or experience? Thanks  Love Lizz xxx",

      "Content": "Hi ladies Thank you for your reassurance - I feel better now - I think it was a middle-of-the-night panic mainly.  I envy you in the UK who can get R1R2 on prescription - if I order it here it'll cost about 100\u20ac for a six week course, and I am reluctant to spend that much (although, I probably need to give myself a good talking to about priorities - what exactly am I saving my money for?) It seems complicated if you have to keep your breast uncovered for 20 minutes after you apply the gel because I am usually going straight back to work, so I'm probably not an ideal candidate for that, anyway. Karen, thank you. especially for replying from your holiday retreat. I have a friend (a nurse) whose husband is a doctor and I've asked him if he might be able to prescribe the 100% hyaluronic acid cream. He is heavily into homeopathy and has already given me a very detailed prescription of various granules (mostly reimbursed) and essential oils (not), but I hope he's not opposed to this cream - I just discovered that the one my oncologist gave me contains parabens which is extremely frustrating when I've tried to eliminate them from every other product since before chemo. You're right that things seem very different from one French region to another. I am disappointed that I didn't have a different onco for chemo - the brusque one has been the one I've been under throughout although he is a radio specialist. On a positive note, as the Cancer Centre only opened last autumn I imagine all the machines are brand spanking state-of-the-art new. And the technicians are certainly lovely. I'm just really scared of what I don't know or can't prepare for, I suppose. After the first chemo I felt a lot more confident going into the second, but I'm frightened that the radio side effects creep up on you. Thank goodness for this site and all you lovely women. I'll try to sleep tonight, and not wake up and post another panic. Lots of love and thanks Lizz xxx",

He was referring to my lumpectomy scar and how it will 'change' during radio. Having been told to keep it protected from the sun for the first six months to give it the best chance to fade, am I now going to have it darken and become more visible anyway? Can I do anything to prevent that happening? (obviously not in the five hours before treatment - everyone's made that REALLY clear!) I dreaded chemo but actually knowing the side effects were temporary made it a bit more bearable (although I am not coping well with having no hair) - suddenly being thrust into radio and hearing about irreversible side effects is really frightening me. Can I do anything to minimise them?  (Hardening and shrinking of the breast have also been mentioned, and it was only tiny before the WLE!) I have heard about a great cream (R2D2? I think not, but similar in name ) I didn't want to spend any more money but suddenly I can't sleep for worrying so if this is a wonder product perhaps I'll have to. I so didn't expect radio to frighten me, but I haven't slept more than 3 hours a night since Saturday and the real sessions only started yesterday along with back-to-school so I'm already a frazzled wreck and it's only Wednesday morning, Help, please.

I am sometimes slow to respond on here but I always read the replies and often look at new posts - I'm probably not alone in finding it difficult sometimes to talk about what I'm going through, and so I avoid answering, but I always appreciate the messages I read. This community is a fantastic resource and I really value being able to come on here to panic, or moan or occasionally to offer support to others.  I have calmed down a bit now, but I also took Karen's (lacomtekp's) advice and asked a doctor friend (my own doctors are hard to approach) to give me a prescription for hyaluronic acid. I only started with it on Friday after radio so too early to tell, but I'm really reassured to have it. Not sure how I misunderstood, or missed the vital note to wash cream off before the session - the onco said no cream for 5 hours before, so I thought putting it on at 7am when I had radio at 5pm was okay, but there was definitely still a residual layer (I could feel it in my bra, and slightly on my skin,. I think -  so I hope I haven't caused any problems, and I'l take some wet wipes for future evening appointments.  With lots of love and thanks Lizz xxx",

He is always rather blunt, so as someone who's experienced it, can you tell me what it looks like. He showed me the 'thing' which is about 1cm in diameter - I suppose that's a standard piece of kit?

      "Content": "Hi,  I'd just like to start a personal crusade about the term cold cap. I am in France, so apologies if there is no confusion in the U.K. , but I fought for the 'cold cap' and what I was given at my first session of chemo was a shower cap with the type of cooling pouches that physiotherapists use. It was obviously inadequate and I spent the rest of the day in floods of tears. However, my distress led me to contact Paxman who manufacture and supply a scalp-cooling system. It is now widespread in the U.K. (and I have got one into my chemo centre for a 3 month trial, and the nurses are all fully behind it) so I am trying to start a one-person campaign to refer to 'scalp-cooling' if it's a proper refrigerated system = effective, and to avoid 'cold-capping' = imprecise terminology - ask more questions. Lynnwad who posts here has had a great success with Paxman, as I think have other posters. It is brilliant. Oh, and I fought tooth and nail against chemo until my Oncotype DX result indicated that it would bring real benefits, and then I gave in, and apart from the hugely disappointing cold cap experience it has been okay. There are side effects, mostly manageable, and remarkably it does go quite quickly (I'm halfway through 4 cycles of TC and then will have 33 sessions of radiotherapy). Personally I was at my worst between surgery in mid-April and chemo starting mid-June - it was the fear and uncertainty, I think.  All the very best Love Lizz",

Yes, I've had side effects (hair loss being the one I have talked about most on here, but actually avoidable for many who have access to a proper scalp cooling system, and of course, for those who choose the extra inconvenience and discomfort). I have now completed two cycles (of four x TC) and first cycle I had mammoth mouth ulcers, but I felt them developing during dinner one night, so could perhaps have avoided them if I'd eaten softer or less spicy foods, and a nasty rash probably caused by the sun through the car window (I've always had sensitive skin, and it's the first thing to flare up when I'm stressed). In both cycles I was very tired for about a week, but this lifted (more slowly in cycle 2), and, honestly, apart from a very itchy/spotty scalp, and an outbreak of acne (hormone related, I suppose) as well as what I take to be hot flushes (but we've also had temperatures in the 30s and at night it didn't drop below 20 for a week, so it could just be that) I have been FINE In fact, my partner, who is, imo, a hypochondriac, has complained about her health much more than I have about mine, (ever since diagnosis, tbh!) and except when I have left handfuls of hair in the bathroom bin, or been falling-down tired, has completely ignored the fact that I'm going through chemo! (This is not ideal, for any partners reading this - I am never ill, so it would have been lovely to have been slightly pampered during this period, and excused my fair share of cooking, cleaning and washing-up.) Anyway, I hope I haven't spoken too soon, and thanks, Karen, for starting this thread - I hope lots of people who are worried before they start T will be reassured. Lots of love, Lizz  xxxx",

At my first chemo session the cold cap was offered very reluctantly and was inadequate (to say the least) so I'm on tenterhooks now (day 16) waiting to see how much hair will drop out. (So far not too much, although it seems to have accelerated a bit yesterday and today - perhaps because I'm being more active in week 3!) I was so upset after the first session that my girlfriend offered to shave her hair - talk about not getting it! It made me feel that on top of the fear and trauma of losing my hair, I had no one to talk to who could begin to understand. On a VERY POSITIVE note, I also got in touch with Paxman (I actually left a sobbing voicemail when I got home from the first session, before sending a calmer but still plaintive e-mail) who acted very promptly and have arranged a trial of one of their systems at the cancer centre (in France) where I'm being treated, and I'm going in to act as an interpreter for the training day tomorrow. So a really big thanks to them, and best wishes to you all. Love Lizz xxx",

I am posting my original comment, too, so you can see that they did not really address it. I'd be interested to know if anyone is approached to give a counterpoint.  \"I have just heard (so this is not a complaint but only a comment) that Stephen Merchant shaved his head as part of the Macmillan Brave the Shave campaign, and that everyone in the studio had a great laugh about it. Please could you consider doing a rebuttal piece from someone who has lost his/her hair through chemotherapy. I am one of those (currently I have around 1cm of regrowth after my hair fell out around the end of June) and losing my hair was one of the most traumatic things about having cancer. Seeing a shiny scalp in the mirror for weeks, losing eyebrows, eyelashes and pubic hair not for a couple of days until stubble reappeared but for months, has not been fun or remotely funny. I was often overwhelmed by sadness or frustration that I couldn't just walk out of the front door (or even look out of the window onto a busy street) without first putting on a hat or scarf. I was not comfortable without a scarf on even at home, and bought a wig to wear when I went back to work. Psychologically working has done wonders for me, but I hate the wig, which is itchy and restricts my movement (try looking up when something you are wearing around your head is only held on by elastic), and I daren't take a top off over my head in public in case the wig comes too, so as summer changed to autumn and cold mornings developed into warm days I had to suffer being too hot or cold until I could find a private place with a mirror to sort myself out. I am not alone in having hated losing my hair, so please do a piece about other ways of showing support or of the effect of hair loss on those who have had no choice. It is not vanity - I did not want people to know I had cancer - I wanted to be treated the same way as usual, and that included not losing clients because they think that illness = unreliability. People have in fact been very complimentary about my 'new hairstyle', i.e. the wig, but that does not make the horror of hair loss disappear. Alopecia is not the same as a shaved head. Please give this side of the story. Thank you.\" Thank you for contacting Channel 4 Viewer Enquiries regarding SUNDAY BRUNCH.

I mentioned the months of a shiny scalp, the lack of eyebrows and eyelashes, and pubic hair and the need I felt to hide my baldness because I wanted to hide my cancer - I did not want to advertise that I was sick, when frankly I didn't feel ill (except through the side effects of chemo). I also referred to the deep sadness that could well up at any time, but most often for me when I saw myself in the mirror. I suggested they invite someone to give the counter arguments. I hope they will take notice of us. Perhaps this will become the public forum that we have been searching for, for a discussion about the campaign. I now have about 1cm of soft, more-grey-than-I'd-like regrowth - last chemo was on 12th August. My wig, on the other hand is luxuriant. Looking forward to needing a haircut and being able to have a colour. Not sure when I'll go 'commando' - maybe after Christmas?  Love to all Lizz x",

I have asked Paxman for their input, but don't have an answer yet. My ignorance sprang from the generic term being imprecise. I know I'm being dogmatic, but we take a lot of trouble to distinguish between FEC and T or between triple negative, O+ Pr+ Her2+, etc, and slowly we learn about our disease and treatment.

Specifically what you understand by the term and whether you know now, or knew before you started chemo that scalp-cooling is not the same. (Actually, perhaps you can confirm that I've got that right - I'm in France and may have fallen down a linguistic rabbit hole, but I don't think I have). With apologies to all those who've heard this story too many times already, I fought for a cold cap, although the chemo nurse was opposed because it wouldn't work. When I saw what they provided, (a shower cap with the type of ice packs used by physiotherapists) I realised that it wasn't going to work. My distress propelled me to contact a company I'd come across when I was looking for info and they (Paxman - perhaps other scalp-cooling systems exist, but this is the only one I know) got a trial set up in my chemo unit within a fortnight. I have now used this system twice although my hair loss after cycle one was already pretty catastrophic, and it is brilliant. I'd like to bring some clarity to this issue, simply by asking if you were aware of the difference and whether you would support the idea of using different descriptions for these two very different approaches. We already specify what tumour we had, the chemo we are having, etc. because it make a big difference, and so I think it makes sense to convey the important difference between these two approaches to preventing or slowing hair loss.  So, a one-woman crusade (perhaps because I teach English, I am a bit obsessed about the accurate use of language  ) to help those who come after us lobby for something that could be really effective.  If the shower cap affair no longer exists in the UK I apologise for wasting your time.

We all take loads of time to read and respond to other posters questions about treatment protocols, so we are good at learning a new language - can we make a concerted effort to use a term which reflects the actual system used. If I had known that a cold cap could be so useless I might have acted sooner to get a scalp-cooling trial in my local unit - I 'suffered' through ignorance (yes, I know it's nothing in the scheme of cancer treatment) and that could have been avoided.  So a plea to join me in a search for clarity of expression.

I am waiting for the results of the ONCOTYPE DX test which are due in the next few days, and today I went to make an appointment to have a portacath fitted, in case I need it. I can, of course, cancel the appointment, but just talking to my surgeon has made me feel the same absolute dread of chemo that I felt when he first mentioned it after the op.  I know the standard advice is to make your own decision that you will be able to live with, but can anyone help me get my head around this. I feel like I want to refuse chemo even if the test says I'm at a high risk of recurrence. I don't know if that's because I'm scared, or naturally optimistic (I'll be lucky - just like I never got cancer in the first place - no, wait...) but should I even be considering that it's a decision that I can make, or should I just take huge quantities of poison with known, nasty side-effects because a doctor says I should?  I asked my surgeon what he'd advise a member of his family to do, and he said he didn't know. Can you help me get my head clear enough to know what to do. Thanks  Lizzx",

Your reference to my being slightly older was the first thing that has made me feel like me! The surgeon and oncologist keep going on about my young age and bizarrely I was upset (not very!) when you stated the bleedin' obvious - I'm NOT young anymore. (how young are you, btw?) The pre-cancer me is jealous, but considering how badly I'm handling it at 53 (firmly in denial) , I'd never have coped in my 30s or 40s. Love, and thanks for the reminder of the old me!

      "Content": "Carolyn28 hi Lizz I do seem to remember a conversation with French Sarah and Karen Lacompte ? ? I want to live in France and learn to speak French, I'm sure I could do it if I had to, even though I'm rubbish at languages,  I'll add it to my bucket list  : ) Carolyn xx Karen's taking break after having a really bad time with chemo, I think. (Huge apologies if I've got that wrong.) I'll have a look out for French Sarah, but neither of them is very near here. It's true though, that they can help with language / social problems. Why not learn French and come join us - it's beautiful here, and you can learn enough French to get by just be going out and meeting people. Just one caveat - don't come if you can't handle administration. French red tape and paperwork is a labyrinth you can never escape from. Even the medical system, which is excellent, has different percentage reimbursements for different treatments, and a small contribution you pay each time which can be rounded up and deducted all at once so you don't know what you're paying for ... And my cancer treatment is 100% reimbursed except for enhanced fees charged by my surgeon (negotiable). It's a minefield. On the subject - I'm glad the NHS junior doctors have concluded a deal - I'm hope they're reasonably happy. They have my full support x Lizz x",

      "Content": "Dreamthief Hi Lizz  -   iwannaliveforever  In a twisted weird sort of way that score of 47 is better than getting a lowish intermediate score where you still have to play mind games about whether to accept chemo or not. Now the question is - PICC or Central iv line, Portacath, or do you risk trying chemo with the cannula for the first one and see how it goes. Have you been offered any options about this ? Ditto regarding the dentist, depending on when they want to start your sessions - G n' J Hi Dreamthief I have an appointment to have a Portacath fitted on 1st June; (I'm terrified of that too! Really I'm a terrible person to have cancer, I seem to be afraid of it all!) then the chemo starts on 8th June. What's the significance of the dentist's visit? I actually have several untreated dental problems (mostly broken molars where I had big fillings as a child) which I have I left alone because of the cost. I had an abscess under one several years ago and I was referred to a specialist (French system) to have it removed, but I never went. Should I be concerned? The oncologist (who doesn't know all that) said delay any dental treatment until after the chemo.  Thanks Love Lizz x",

I have to be at the centre at 1pm (15 minutes earlier the first time for admin) and I live around 1 hour from the centre. Do I take it before I leave home, during the car journey, as soon as I arrive because it'll take a while before the chemo actually begins? I am having the cold cap so I think that adds to the preparation time, too. Thanks Lizz x",

She specifically mentioned eating carbohydrates (and fruit and veg, obviously) and that wine is okay in moderation but to avoid e.g. Red Bull! I wondered if anyone here has taken any special measures to prepare for chemo? I love pasta and rice, but I've lost my appetite and find it difficult to finish a meal at the moment. Should I try to bulk up a bit (she said not to worry about putting on weight now because I'll lose it during chemo, but I'm not sure that's true, is it?). I am a 'normal' weight at the moment. I would love to get into peak condition before the onslaught - any tips? Thanks Love Lizz x",

      "Content": "Hi I've been avoiding this site because sometimes it makes me worry more (although sometimes you say just the right thing ) Anyway, I hope everyone's doing okay, or finding a way to get through this horrible experience. I am now on Tamoxifen (after lumpectomy, chemo and radio) and being cut adrift by the medical professionals. As I try to get back to normal, I am reconsidering all the lifestyle choices I made before and trying to behave better, so I am taking more exercise, juicing when I have time, moisturising night and morning, etc.) To be honest I wasn't very unhealthy before so there aren't any obvious radical adjustments except... I have always loved beauty products (creams and cleansers, gels and scrubs, hair dye, more than actual make-up. I started looking for a natural hair dye to use when I take off my wig (currently I'm 16 weeks since last chemo, hair is about 2.5cm on average, but quite sparse) and what I read has freaked me out - parabens can promote oestrogen production, apparently and there are all sorts of other nasties such as SLS in everyday products.  So my question is, which brands (not just hair dye, but shower gel, facial cleanser, moisturiser and serum, etc) are considered safe? I'm coming to the UK (from France) at Xmas and am prepared to go a little crazy in Boots if I'm sure the products aren't harmful. If I look at my life before cancer the one thing I never considered was the list of ingredients on cosmetics, so (2 + 2 = 100 ) that's what I'm most frightened of. Any tips? As I say, it's Christmas so I'm ready to spoil myself. Thanks and love LIzz xxxxx",

I'll give the moisturisers a go - I've got No7 day and night creams and serum but everyone seems to think they're one of the worst offenders, so I've stopped using them and just put on a homemade mixture of argan, rosehip and wheatgerm oil, which a nurse friend recommended for my breast during radio. I'm also using up the Ialuset (hyaluronic acid) cream which the onco gave me for the same thing, but it has a rather tightening effect. I've mixed it with coconut oil from H&B which is fine at night but a bit too oily for daytime use (my pencilled-in eyebrows slither off if I'm not careful!) Thank you  Love Lizz xxx",

      "Content": "Thank you all for so many lovely, helpful replies.  Spiced Tea - I was dreading taking my first tamoxifen and put it off for the first weekend after I got the prescription (so I had 2 days with neither radiotherapy nor hormone therapy) and swallowed the first one with great trepidation. It's been 6 weeks now, and apart from hot flushes I've been fine. Probably a bit creakier of joint, but really nothing that has impacted on my life. As with every single step of this process  (except, in my case, for the portacath insertion which was 10 times worse than I'd been lead to believe) the thought was worse than the reality. I wish you all the best, and try not to worry (I couldn't sleep for the couple of nights either side of my first dose, but then I'm developing insomnia as a lifestyle choice!). Karen (lacomptek) All the very best for tomorrow's mammogram. I hope they're gentle and reassuring, and especially that the results are clear. I didn't usually get my routine mammogram results immediately, but is it different for those who've had cancer? My next one isn't until April - the anniversary of my diagnosis. Has it been a year for you? The reason I'm thinking of going mad in Boots rather than here is that I love the choice but also I have points on my Advantage card and some cash in the UK which with the exchange rate. I'm better off spending there. And I'm going by train, so not too difficult to bring liquids back. I'll certainly check out the Dove shower gel for everyday use, but I love to have something to pamper myself with once in a while. I'm also extremely fussy about hair care - I had very curly hair which tended to be dry so I always used products to minimise frizz (John Frieda Frizz Ease - anyone know if that's full of nasties?). Who knows what my hair will be like when it grows in properly and settles down, but it already seems wavy, so after a lifetime of hating it I'm now hoping it'll come back just like its was before! Quel caprice! I'll check out the Palmers Cocoa Butter that a few people have referred to - I think we can get that here.  And I'll add plastic bottles to me 'to worry about' list   - a small 'benefit' of cancer for me has been that I have only had one migraine since diagnosis and I've been attributing this to drinking a lot more water. I have a plastic (BPA free, whatever that means) bottle I refill and carry with me all day. I've just had a swig before writing this sentence - I think I'll take my chances with it. Anyway, thank you all Lots of love Lizz xxxx",
