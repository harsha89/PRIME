      "Content": "Everyone copes differently. Here is my experience. My partner works away all week but did come to most of my chemo sessions. More because he wanted to rather than he needed to every 3 weeks. I was more than capable of driving myself. I was able to work from home and only had 2 days off after the 4th round of chemo when changed to Dexotol cut to joint pains. Take pain killers in advance of that one.  I continued to train at the gym, worked full time and the housework got done when I felt like it.  Listen to your body, yes I was tired, take a snooze when you need it. I had offers of help but too independent to take it apart from partner and son. I was lucky and was told because I kept active, fairly good diet most of the time the side effects were less. I managed a walking holiday to Edinburgh. My life didn't change, stay positive, take it in your stride and listen to your body.  I've had my down days and a meltdown but I'd done too much housework, cut grass and worried I hadn't taken dog out. Those days will happen, have a good cry and try to pick yourself up. ",

      "Content": "Hi,  Due to have a Picc line next week.  I've read you shouldn't lift more than 10lbs!.  I thought I could carry on weight training during treatment if I felt up to it as advised by Dr's  but currently lift around 120lbs deadlifts and 20kg overhead press.    Is having this line really so restrictive? ",
