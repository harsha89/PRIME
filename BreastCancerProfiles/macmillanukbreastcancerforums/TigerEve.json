    "Content": "Hi JayRand, My experience with Letrozole is this:  I started on it 2 years ago - almost to the day.  My hair was so slow to grow that I thought I'd lost it for ever.  It took over a year to have anywhere close to enough hair to comb, and later on, trimmed and styled. My hairdresser assured me that cutting it would 'thicken it up'.  It didn't. I've had three trims since then with a long time between each. I only ever needed a tidy-up, never an actual REAL good CUT you understand.  Lately, well, about a week ago I noticed that I seem to be starting with a bald patch on top - I have a side parting on my right side and this seems to be emphasizing this 'new' thinning patch.  Its causing me great concern and I really don't know who to speak to about it.  I only see my surgeon or his team member every 6 months and I was signed off the oncology team a few weeks after the last Chemo in March 2012.  Before all of this kicked off beautiful long long hair - quite thickish too.  Its soul destroying to see how I look now, from how I did about three years ago.  I don't know about you but my weight is being badly affected by the Letrozole too and I really seem to be fighitng a losing battle.  Bar ceasing the Letrozole whats to be done about it?  No, its NOT trivial at all JayRand.  Your hair is part of your image to the world - the very thing that most people notice.  Of course its getting you down.  It gets me down too.  I just don't know of any advice I can offer I'm sorry because I'm in the same position. Take care, TigerEye  ",
