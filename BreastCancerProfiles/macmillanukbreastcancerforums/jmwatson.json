The steroids are so small dose from what I had with tax that I will cope better with them. Got a sore throat which came on a few hours after chemo so drinking loads and trying to eat softer foods. Got to have a central line put in next time as my veins are not good. How are you feeling now after your first tax?",

I finished chemo last Thursday and got surgery in a month, I can't wait to have a drink to toast my end of chemo but I know I have to lose weight as put about a stone and half on putting it up to 5 stone I need to lose. I feel that is going to be my biggest battle losing the pounds but I know it is going to be for my health, so I'm going to enjoy my time up to Christmas and then once this is over I'm getting stuck in to the new healthier me.

      "Content": "Hi, I know I may not be of help as still going through treatment but having read what you've put it sounds like the post side effects as my Macmillan nurse calls it. I was told that it will take about a year to fully regain your energy if anyone can agree with that. I think once you've had your hysterectomy you will feel better as your having that for a reason. You've certainly been through the mill and being stressed is going to take every bit of energy but you need to talk to someone. If you go to your gp they should be able to refer you or put your in touch with your nearest MacMillan nurses who will understand what you are going through and offer advice. We think because the cancer is gone and there is no more treatment that we move on quickly but it is the stress and shock of what our bodies have gone through so if we don't feel poo afterwards then its amazing. I was told to expect having a bit of a breakdown as I approach my first year as the memories come back so I will be prepared for that as you go from having constant checks and talking to nothing. Hope that has been some help but I would definitely go and see your gp even if they refer you to 'mind' for mental health as its someone to talk to and they are great x",

      "Content": "With docetaxel, I found that wasn't that bad, its the heavy amount of steroids you have to take. On my first session I had a reaction so they gave me pirition before each one which made me very sleepy. The steroids made me extremely bloated and it made my IBS bad so I was allowed to take buscopan which stopped the pain so was bearable. I drank loads the first few days which helped with the bloating as the tax tends to retain fluids. I never got oral thrush, but did get sore throat, horrible feeling in my mouth where my tongue and the roof of my mouth felt rough and lost my taste buds. About day 5 I would get achy joints or back pain but I knew when it would start so I would start taking paracetamol every 4 hours to nip it in the bud so it wasn't so bad. Sleepless nights because of the steroids were bad but once you stop the steroids I was sleeping again. After a week I started feeling good again. Even though my hair started to fall out, it has stopped and what I have got has grown so if yours has started to grow you shouldn't really lose much. My oncologist said that most people find tax the hardest so I'm hoping that is true and fec will be easier but when you have got use to one, it is scary to end up with another and not knowing how you will react to it. Good luck, hopefully you will get through it OK x",

I had to inject myself for 7 days but I had a reaction to those so they changed it to 1 slow release which I did they day after.

After my 1st chemo, I had rice for dinner one evening, within a couple of hours I was getting use to sitting on the throne as I was in and out of the loo and had bad stomach ache. Since then, I've tried twice now and each time I have a small portion of rice I get a bad stomach and can't be too far away from the bathroom. I have also found that if I eat late in the evening I get bad reflux and the other thing is alcohol. I didn't drink all the way through and now having finished chemo I fancy a drink now and again but each time I've had a drink I get reflux and insomnia, really thinking that its not worth it as I'm tired constantly and this really isn't helping. A friend of mine, her husband after chemo can't eat meat as he became very ill every time. Its strange just what chemo can do to our bodies and so far it looks like that I have to give up rice and become tea total but thankfully its not stopped me from eating cake lol x",

I got use to what worked and what didn't on tax and I knew that day 5 would be my worse but as long as I rested I would get through it. Basically for me I wouldn't sleep because of the high steroids you take and I suffer with IBS and the steroids and tax would upset that. I was given lansopazole and took buscopan which helped a lot. I did suffer with reflux and indigestion which a bottle of gaviscon went down well. My nails haven't fallen off but are very ridged so I keep them short and use hand cream. I never took any anti sickness drugs as never felt sick but I have put on weight as tax will make you retain fluid and steroids will make you eat. I had achy joints which would last a couple of days so I knew day 5/6 I need to take paracetamol/codine to stop it getting worse. Generally I felt like I had flu with sweating at night as well. I injected myself with the white cell injections but I had my changed to the 1 slow release as I had a reaction to the 1 a day and ended up in hospital for 3 days, they just don't know who will react. They will paint the absolute worse of things and hope you get it good, after my 1st cycle every one has been better but compared to fec tax is worse. All I can say is be prepared to feel s### for a week, the bloating, fluid retention, aches, tiredness, sickness whichever you get will go and resting will help alot. I expected to be really bad but I have an open mind to things and unfortunately I tend to look on the bright side and won't let things beat me so my experience won't help others as I paint a bright sunny picture when it seems pretty black lol Hope I've helped you in some way, I was the same about starting fec, its the unknown and I actually wanted to stay on tax as I got it under control but now I'm glad fec has worked out well for me.

The shortness of breath is the steroids, and I've found really trying to relax does ease it but with the school holidays and 2 children that's hard to do. Achy joints, just take paracetamol every 4 hours, if thats not helping get it with codine.

Having 2 young children who needed taking to school/pick up, birthday parties and entertaining I had to get on with it. I started my treatment at the start of the 6 weeks holidays so they got use to the 1st week after chemo of not doing much. I might take them to the park and sit while they played, then my 2nd week we started to do more. Once they went back to school, I would do things when I felt like it, housework waited but I still went out with friends for coffee or lunch. Shopping I would do once I dropped the kids off or in the evening, it was quiet so nicer to walk round without too many people looking at me in my hat. Depending on how you feel, do what you can handle, if you stop doing what you feel like then you will feel bad. A part from the chemo side effects, I felt great and didn't feel ill for long, you soon get use to the cycle.

Ask for your next chemo to be reduced as this can lead to more problems but the oncologist should know that this is a possible side effect. Good luck x",

      "Content": "My side effects are flu like, the day after chemo I had loads of energy but I would sit and rest as didn't want to over do it. No sickness or nausea so haven't taken the anti sickness drugs., I lost my taste so nothing tasted nice. The joint pain comes on about day 5 so I take paracetamol every 4 hours to prevent it getting worse, that seems to be my low days for about 2 days. The worse part is the steroids, I don't sleep for about a week and they interact with my ibs so my stomach gets bad and I spend some quality time with the loo! A part from that I know its only for a few days and once the steroids are finished I know I will sleep. I'm going to take buscopan this cycle as I suffered with my stomach and got the OK from my oncologist. Everyone is different so hopefully you won't be too bad, as I had the reaction from the injections first time, this last cycle was a breeze. My cycle of fec I'm sure will bring something new but just pleased not to have to have the steroids x",

I phoned the hospital and was told to come in, I was put in isolation for 3 days as was at risk of further infection. Since then after my 2nd, I had a couple of days where I felt like I had flu but nothing compared to the first. What you have described sounds like side effects but if your temperature goes up then you need to contact them. Which chemo are you on?",

Your sister needs to have her down days and support from friends and family is the best way for her cope. Personally for me, I'm probably the minority but I've not let this get me down. I'm stage 2 and have just completed 6 cycles of chemo, surgery is in as couple of weeks and then I'll have radiotherapy after Christmas. I know the outcome is good, I've shown good progress etc all the way through but I'm happy, I've not cried at all and not been sad/upset, I'm not saying that I'm Supergirl but once this is over the reality of this may come crashing down, this is how I'm dealing with it now with a positive mind and attitude and 2 young children. The one thing I like is friends coming round or going out for coffee and the biggest cake going! As long as you are there for your sister and hopefully she will log on here and see that everything she needs to know and the support she gets here will help her through. If there is anything you want to know then just ask x",

I was given loads of booklets when I was diagnosed on chemo, operations etc but to be perfectly honest, I've only looked through a couple as I felt keeping reading things will do my head in, maybe that's why I've handled this well as I've just listened to my doctors and read things on here by people who have gone through this. Sometimes having too much info can completely make you feel worse, get in touch with the Macmillan nurses and talk to them, mine has been a breath of fresh air, so helpful and understanding. They will support you in anyway and answer questions that you may have, you have had bad news, giving up smoking etc all at the same time so you are quite rightly going to suffer with anxiety. Any more questions, just post on here and we will all help to answer x",
