      "Content": "hello amelie, thanks for responding yeah its a pretty big decision, im really worried. do you mind i ask if you already had cancer present before your matectomy?  so happy you had a positive experience with a pleasing outcome. did they replace the nipple or are you still without? its amazing what they can do these days! yeah i have pretty small boobs too, but my surgeon suggested implants as they dont think i have enough tissue unfortunately. thankyou, i will take time and get more information.  im glad your happy with your results, good luck xx",
