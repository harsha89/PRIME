      "Content": "I am on 4th cycle of FEC-T at moment. My chemo started within a week of diagnosis so had no time to think about it and to be honest just wanted it to start. The actual chemo session is actually easy. Mine is administered by a cannula and once its in you dont feel a thing. Some of the drugs give you a funny taste in mouth but to be honest I sit drink tea and juice, read my kindle, play on my ipdad or work on my laptop I havent been sick once, but have been very tired, bad constipation and mouth ulcers but they give you drugs to alleviate that. In fact the minute you have a symptom there is a drug to reduce or take it away. You get to know which days you are more tired",
