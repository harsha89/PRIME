I am usually very fit (lots of running and swimming!) but after the treatment felt absolutely exhausted-really achy and tired just like having flu.  Went to bed for an hour and feel a bit better but really odd. I feel such a \"lightweight\" after only first session!! Is this normal?",

      "Content": "I am 48 and 4 years ago was diagnosed with breast cancer. I had a total mastectomy and reconstruction but last month was told the cancer had returned. I am shocked and in disbelief. Last week I had a lumpectomy and lymph nodes removed for testing and am awaiting results. How do I cope with the extreme emotion? What happens if it reoccurs a third/ fourth time?",
