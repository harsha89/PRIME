      "Content": "Hi Lucy Thanks you for you're response. Incidentally I'm from Scotland too and I don't know if you're aware that the Scottish government has recently agreed to fund the oncotype test. That aside I'm just hoping the result helps me decide. I'm just not sure if it's worth it with all the side effects of chemo when there are no guarantees it won't come back anyway. However if the percentage falls into the higher level then I probably will take it.  I hope you're doing well Love  Elaine  Xx",

However looking at the side effects of chemo has made me rethink my decision hence the reason for opting for the test.  I'm just worried that if it's in the mid range that I'll be no further forward with my decision.

I really think I'd prefer not to and hope that the oncologist can reassure me but so far I'm being told I'm borderline and told the statistics and that it's going to come down me choosing.  My husband would really prefer me to have it as he thinks we should throw everything at it. My daughter is thinking more about the side effects ( she's a student nurse) and is a bit less keen.  I know it has to be my choice but how would I cope with the guilt if I don't have it and it comes back. It's such a dilemma hence why I opted for the oncotype dx test.  Anyway roll on Wednesday. Keep well Elaine X",

No lymph node involvement thankfully I met with my oncologist last week who asked me to consider chemo as there's a risk of recurrence. I assumed that I'd just have radiotherapy and hormone therapy. I opted for the oncotype test to try to help me to decide and will get the result next week.  I've read a bit about this now but I'm very undecided as there are no guarantees even with chemo and I'm not sure I want to put myself through it.  I am someone who needs to feel in control of my life and at least I have a choice whether to take it or not. However I think if I was being told that I definitely need it then the decision would be easier.  Has anyone had to make this decision who would like to tell me what influenced their decision please",

      "Content": "Hi Ann-Marie  You're right this is a fantastic forum and has helped me immensely. I'm very well thank you. My test came back at 19 so my oncologist was happy for me to have radiotherapy and Letrozole and no chemo so that was a great relief as I wasn't sure what I'd have  done had it came back in the mid range so in a way the choice was easy for me.  I completed radiotherapy last week and I'm off to New York tomorrow so all is good. I'm a bit tired and a little sore but otherwise fine. Not sure if you're aware of the scoring system for the oncotype test. Someone on here sent me a diagram but can't remember who but I'm sure it'll be online somewhere. If you can find it I'm sure it'll help. I hope it all goes well for you. However as you may have seen on here from the people who have had chemo, it's all doable.  The waiting for the test is in some ways worse because when you get it at least you then know the way forward in you're treatment. I found the waiting for this test worse than anything else as my head took me to places I didn't want to go. So I empathise with you right now.  I assume, like me ,  you're borderline for chemo and hence the test?? One thing more,  I audiotaped my appts, which helped me to understand/remember all that was said. The oncologist will be fine with that as long as you ask them first,  I'm sure. Hope this helps. Let me know how you get on  Lots of luck  Elaine xx",

It was her- oestrogen + and progesterone- with clear nodes.  I opted for the test as I was told I was l borderline for chemo. Like moonstar I had 2 lumpectomies 15 rads and now on letrozole. My score was 19 So oncologist felt there would be no more benefit from chemo.  I remember agonising over what I'd do if it came back in the mid range. I had made up my mind that if it was high I'd take it but if in the mid range I just didn't know.  It was such a relief when it came back as it did. It was the longest 2 weeks in the whole process waiting for that result.  I am glad I took the test though because it did help my decision in the end. They initially offered me chemo and because I wasn't sure they offered the oncotype dx test.  So I would say go for it.  Chemo has a lot of side effects and I know everyone is different but for me I was glad I didn't need to face them I hope you manage to reach a decision.  Incidentally Dreamthief's graph helped me to understand the scoring system too Lots of luck Elaine",

Accord and now on Femara which is the most expensive. Initially I had horrendous back pain along with all the other aches and pains. It certainly got better and I was sure at the time it was down to changing the brand. However, I cant really say its been sustained which makes me unsure if there is any difference really. Some mornings I wake and can hardly move. The pain in my hips are awful. I feel so bloody old. I walk a lot which I hope helps but havent really thought abt supplements. Think I might try the anti histamine someone mentioned. I'll try anything because right now I feel  like stopping it altogether.I already personally know three ladies who did this as they couldnt tolerate it. However Im frightened of recurrence so probably wont.  Sorry to moan about all this and I know we are all different.  I suppose my point is that does it really matter what brand we take? I know people say its all about the coatings and fillers but Ive got the rolls royce of brand and it doesnt really make much difference to the aches and pains. Sorry Wendy. Not really helping you. I do hope things settle for you as it seems that many ladies have been ok on i Letrozole Take care Elaine xx",

I went to my GP about 18 months before my breast cancer diagnosis  She had me do a few exercises and took blood to check for tumour markers. However everything came back clear and she suggested self referral to physio as she thought it was muscular I didn't bother.!!! Fast forward to my diagnosis which was a 40mm grade 2 tumour, oestrogen + with no lymph spread. Now on Letrozole and I feel it's worse. My pain is in my Hips, lower back and sometimes radiates into my groin. It's also worse at night and when resting.  I'm still able to go to the gym and some days are worse than others. I manage it with ibuprofen and paracetamol. Anyway I decided to bite the bullet and get a consultation with my GP on Tuesday while having my smear test. She ordered an xray of my hips and pelvis and i had that today so waiting the result. I'm driving myself mad, convinced of the worse. However I can rationalise it at times telling myself that there would be other signs,  weight loss etc. The  doc did say it's more likely to be arthritis so the x-ray is to check for signs of that. On a positive note she said downstairs looked healthy lol nice to know I think .  I suppose what I'm saying is. Does this fear ever leave. I try to get on with life and usually can but it's the first thing on my mind as soon as I wake up and I'm sick of it.  Thank the Lord for this network of people who are always here for support. Anyway I've decided if this comes back clear, I'm going to try my damdest  to park the worry. I've so much to look forward to and know others who are worse off Hope all goes well for you  Elaine xx",

I've hardly slept for coughing and my body so sore, and I can now hardly speak as I'm so hoarse. For someone who generally bounces back from common colds, I'd had enough and phoned my GP surgery , who got the Duty GP to phone me. As soon as I told him my symptoms and recent history they asked me to come in. He said \"you've been through so much recently, let's examine you and we can make a decision together on whether I should prescribe Anti biotics \" He was lovely and I felt so cared for. The upshot is after examining me I was given Anti biotics as he thinks I have a strep  throat. He said that the rads will have compromised my immunity and this is why I'm struggling to fight it off. So hopefully I'll feel better soon.  He also said if my symptoms get worse I should go straight back.  All I can say is. You know yourself.

      "Content": "Hi Laura I read this and it sounds exactly where I was in July last year. I was 56 too. I too was initially told grade 1 14mm invasive lobular tumour following biopsy and ultrasound.  I had an MRI the following week as is standard. About 5 days later My lumpectomy and sentinel node biopsy were done on the same day. I was admitted early morning and taken to the mammography Dept where they insert a wire via ultrasound and local anaesthetic to assist the surgeon in targeting exactly where the tumour is situated. They then did a mammogram to ensure it was situated properly. Later that day I was taken to theatre and the tumour and 3 nodes were removed. I then had a week to see the surgeon again. Unfortunately ( and this is quite common) they didn't get clear margins and my tumour was larger than first thought. It was 40mm and therefore upgraded to a grade 2. I had a further op to remove this but fortunately my lymph nodes were clear. I suppose I'm telling you this to help prepare you're mum as at this point I was totally unprepared as everything up to that point indicated a small area so it was a bit of a shock. However it was all fine with the ops  very bearable. I remember the surgeon saying the MRI wasn't as helpful as it could have been and that it wasn't until the results of my first lumpectomy came back that they realised the extent of the spread.  However I have an oestrogen + progestogen- and herceptin - cancer which apparently is a good one to have as targeted hormone therapies have made a huge difference in recent years.  I was asked to consider chemo as it was progesterone- so was considered borderline. I opted for the oncotype dx test which is a test done in America. They send tissue samples from the tumour to test you're risk of recurrence and again fortunately I had a low score and therefore declined chemo. ( longest 2 weeks of my life ) I then had 15 radiotherapy sessions. Again all doable. Btw if mum has to have this come back on and ask about skin care. Very helpful. I am now on a drug called Letrozole for 5 years which is commonly used in us post menopausal ladies and then possibly tamoxifen for another 5. That will depend on the most up to date research when the time comes. Side effects are bearable mainly. Night sweats and achy joints are the main ones for me. But exercise and diet help. As to you're holiday. Go for it. I had 10 days in Spain between ops and radiotherapy and 5 days in new York a week after radiotherapy.  I hope this helps. Feel I've rambled but I know how much this forum helped me. Please ask anything at all on here. The knowledge is unbelievable as is the support.  Wish you're mum good luck. She'll be fine with a lovely daughter like you by her side. I was lucky to have mine by my side and it helped immensely especially when having my meltdowns Take care Elaine X   I ",

      "Content": "Hi helsbels  Like you my 40mm tumour didn't show on mammogram and they weren't even certain of size until first surgery as they thought even after MRI it was smaller than it actually was. I heard the surgeon say to a trainee that the MRI and ultrasound weren't as useful as they had hoped  So like you I really don't have faith in mammogram. I asked my oncologist about it at my second appt with her and she said and I quote \"don't worry, we have previous mammograms to compare \" which didn't reassure me but did confuse me as I've been having mammograms since I was 45 due to family history. I was 56 at diagnosis.  So surely they already had previous ones to compare with. However I'm not due these until July as only just finished rads 2 weeks ago. I'd be interested in how you get on  Regards Elaine ",

      "Content": "Hi Cooper L Did you stop taking these suddenly. They can have terrible side effects which do generally pass after a while but a month of it is quite long to get these. However it's one of the worse ones to stop suddenly and can make you quite Ill depending what you're dose was. Was it 37.5 Mgs  ?? Are you on it for depression or anxiety or both. ?? There are many others you can try as it's not a one size fits all I'm afraid. You're GP should be able to advise.  Hope you feel better soon  Elaine",

The GP told me my immune system would have been compromised by the rads. I also took an allergic reaction to the first antibiotic she gave me. As ive had this one before i couldnt undrrstand it but again she said sgain it was because of my treatment. Since then I seem to pick up everything going. They do say the effect of radiotherapy can last for many years so I assume this is it.  Hope you feel better soon  Elaine",
