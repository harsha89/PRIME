    "Content": "Hi I was diagnosed last September with a grade 3 tumour in the right breast, I had 6 lots of AC chemo to shrink the lump but it didn't work as expected and has subsequently affected my heart function.  I had a mastectomy and node clearance in March and radiotherapy in May.  With medication the heart has recovered enough to start herceptin but after 2 lots I am now feeling terrible.  I have a muga scan this week so will find out if it has affected heart. Has anybody had any similar experiences? I have been really positive throughout treatment but am struggling a bit just now, I expected life to be getting back to normal by now.  I am struggling with fatigue and pain in my arm and shoulder.  ",
