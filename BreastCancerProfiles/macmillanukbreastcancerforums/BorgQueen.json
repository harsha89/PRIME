      "Content": "Hi, I have been on Exemestane since the end of July, I was previously on Letrozole. So far the only thing I've noticed is my joint/bone aches have increased and my hot flushes have decreased...which is good!. I'm on a calcium tablet to help with the bone thinning part, as I'm 37 and have been 'forced' into a menopause by having zoladex injections, so I could be on the right hormone tablet. Hope this helps! Keep us posted on how you get on. Melanie xx",

      "Content": "HI, I applied for Pip last September & within 3 weeks had my first payment.  I arranged it all over the phone & they contacted my doctor to confirm details etc, then next thing I knew the money was in my bank followed by a letter confirming everything.  I think I must have been very lucky as a friend of a friend applied last October & is still waiting for payments & has been told she'll need a medical first!!! I wish you luck with it all, give them a call to see what stage your application is at. Mel xx",

      "Content": "I'm of the understanding that we get a review of our PIP after a set amount of time, mine will be in 3 years time, Nov 2016 then we keep receiving payments, as it is based on people with a disability or long-term ill-health condition. I've put a link to the website which will give you more information. https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/simplifying-the-welfare-system-and-making-sure-work-pays/supporting-pages/introducing-personal-independence-payment Hope this helps!.
