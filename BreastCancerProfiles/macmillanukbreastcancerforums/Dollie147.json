    "Content": "I recently came across an article which says alcohol can increase the risk of breast cancer. It says that breast cancer is also one of the main health effects of drinking too much of alcohol. Is it true? Is there any link between alcohol consumption and breast cancer? My sister who is 37 now has battled alcoholism for a few years. She finally became sober for a couple of months and got diagnosed with Breast Cancer a month back. After she got to know about her disease, she started drinking heavily again. She has started chemo, but, has been hospitalized twice for complications. She doesn\u2019t even take her medicines which she is supposed to take. Everyone in the family is concerned about this but she doesn't care at all. Â She is addicted to alcohol and I don't know if she could quit them without any help. So I\u2019m thinking of consulting one of the best psychologists and get her an addiction therapy in Calgary. But I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s safe for her to undergo an addiction treatment at this stage? Any ideas? Thank you!",
