      "Content": "Hi, Many thanks for the advice...I will do some research online. I wish you ll the very best with your treatment. I am not sure whether this will be useful to you, but I did a lot of research before my Mum started her chemo and bought loads of things (a lot of which my Mum chose not to use) However the one thing my Mum now swears by is Manuka honey. I bought her a tub for Â£20 with a '+6' on it and my Mum started taking a small spoonful 3 times a day a couple of weeks before her first chemo and she has had no problems with ulcers or a sore gullet or lots of the similar complaints I read about - My Mum absolutely swears by it now...it might be worth a try! I wish you all the very best Many thanks again Rich",

      "Content": "Hi, My Mum has breast cancer and has just had her 5th Chemotherapy treatment today, When I first found out my Mum had cancer I came on this forum and found lots of really helpful advice that I was able to pass on to my Mum. I was also able to buy lots of different things for her that made the whole process a little easier for her. My Mum has lost all her hair and we were able to get a wig that looks so realistic you can't tell, however my Mum is starting to lose her eyebrows and eyelashes and she is worried about how she looks now. She never wears make up normally but she would really appreciate some advice about eye make up. Please can anyone make any recommendations of brand etc. I would be very grateful for any advice regarding this. Please can anyone offer any suggestions? Many thanks and all my very best wishes. Rich",
