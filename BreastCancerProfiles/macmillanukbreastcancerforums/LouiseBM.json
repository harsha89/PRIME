    "Content": "On Monday I have to decide whether to have Chemo or just radiotherapy and Tamoxifan. I am borderline according to my Oncologist and the decision is mine. I had a 13mm lump removed plus tissue and nodes closest to the lump. They believe they have got all the cancer and now I have to start the prevention! I will be very receptive to the Tamoxifan and the radiotherapy will be 15 bouts. Together they take me down to a 8% chance of recurrence. If I take the Chemo I gain another 4%. What should I do, I just don't know...all too scary!",
