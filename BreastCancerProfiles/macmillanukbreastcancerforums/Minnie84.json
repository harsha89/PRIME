I just don't understand the time scales of it all. I am 33 and obviously not near menopause so I understand the need to suppress the ovaries but why 2 years when my tamoxifen is 10 years? It all seems a bit weird. I'm eager to stop the Zoladex due to the side effects, but it's hard trying to weigh up the pros and cons when the information I have been given seems a bit vague.  That said I know we are all lucky to have the health care system we have and access to medications like we do, I really don't want to come across as ungrateful, I just don't think there's enough explanation of our treatments. I see my oncologist next week, I've only met her once before and this is my signing off appointment, so I'm going armed with a lot of questions! Let us know how you get on in December, fingers crossed!  Xx",

Obviously for them they do it from a cost perspective so women can it a sense try the menopause before they buy it. But perhaps in your case this might help you decide where to go from here?

Mine was adamant that it is protocol to have both tamoxifen and Zoladex with a hormone receptive cancer. I'm not sure I'll ever fully understand what I'm taking or why, I'm just blindly following at the moment.  I'm due to see my oncologist next week so I think I'm going to write some questions to ask. I think it's my signing off appointment and to say I'm worried is an understatement. It seems that all the support you need is there during surgery and treatment, but things don't really hit you until after the storm and then you're on your own.  Sorry I sound really pessimistic, having a down day and need to give myself a shake I think xx",

I think that from the moment of diagnosis we are placed on a conveyer belt and passed through so many things that we don't have time to digest what is happening to us and the reality of what we are dealing with. It's not until things slow down that it hits us. I've been struggling with this too and have started seeing a counsellor.  I worked all the way through everything and only took a little time off for my surgery (lumpectomy and sentinel node removal), now I've finished radiotherapy and have had to take time off work as I no longer feel physically or mentally capable of doing much. I think this is probably normal, it is a lot to go through, but I think to outsiders it must seem very strange that it's only now that it sets in. Since going off sick I've been let go from my job and so that as well is worrying me. It was hard enough feeling the pressure to get better and return to a job that I knew without the stress of trying to find new employment! Try to be kind to yourself and allow yourself to grieve. It's definitely part of the process of coming to terms with everything you've been through. You are strong and you will feel better. Huge hugs xx",
