I may be wrong, but I feel good and I'm attending our school's basketball practices! Thank you for the hug! It was really sweet of you :)  God bless :)",

      "Content": "I'm turning 18 soon and recently something hurt under my right armpit and found a lump beneath the skin of my armpit (you can't really tell until you try to feel it) it hurts when I touch it. So, I search it on the net and found symptoms of breast cancer. That's when I noticed my right nipple is inverted. The nipple does not hurt and there is no lump on my breast. After some days, the lump is less tender but there is still a lump.  *sorry, english is not my first language. I hope it makes sense. I'm really anxious.",
