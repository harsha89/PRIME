      "Content": "I am already on the trial I finished my treatment end of October, what type of breast cancer do you have? Mine was invasive lobular and was in the 2 nodes that I had removed. If you ever need a chat just message me. It's worth going for it and if you have to have chemo it's tiring but I was fine on it and still worked, I just had the week off that I had the chemo as mine was 6 sessions having one every three weeks.

      "Content": "I was meant to have the clearance done but I had an infection after my op so I had the radiotherapy done on the area instead. I know exactly how you feel, when I first got diagnosed I didn't want to have to have chemo, then when it was found in my nodes they said to have chemo then they offer the trial so you might not need it It completely spun my head, I asked so many questions and like you I expect you have a lot of ' what if's' in your thoughts . If you didn't need chemo think of it as a good thing, they wouldn't send you down that road if it was going to be a risk to your health.  It's a big decision so just make sure you do it for you, I felt they put pressure on me a little to get there numbers up  I'm out the other side now so keep positive and it will all be over before you no it xx",

      "Content": "Hi, I was diagnosed last Feb and after my op they also found some cells in my lymph nodes this is when I was also offered the optima trial. It completely put my head in a spin with 'what ifs' but in the end I went for it and I was chose to have chemo but obviously I don't know which route took me to that. After being on it I'm glad I chose it, I'm now on tamoxifen 10 yrs and  goserelin once a month for 3 yrs but I was only put on that as I'm on the trial. All the best to you x",

      "Content": "Hi , I have just read your post about the Optima trial and wondered how you got on? I have been told I need chemo as I had a very small amount of cells in 2 lymph nodes but have been offered the trial. It's all quite scary and I'm still undecided so am interested in how others have got on Thanks ",

      "Content": "Most definitely, it took me a few weeks to decide. As don't think they would dice with peoples lives that's why it might not even except you and you have chemo anyway. Let me know how you get on and good luck with what you decide to do x",
