      "Content": "I'm currently in the same dilemma. Following  a lumpectomy at the beginning of Nov '09 (with clear marginal tissue and 1 of 4 nodes positive) and axiliary clearance at the start of Dec '09, I heard just before Christmas that all the 2nd set of lmyph nodes were clear, which was a releif. Last week I went to see my Oncologist for the 1st time, knowing chemo was likely to be recommended and fully expecting to agree to start ASAP. However in that meeting I was shocked by how little the chance of recurrence was likely to reduce if I have chemo. My understanding is that if I do nothing, there is just over a 50:50 chance of the cancer recurring within 5 years. If I have chemo,there is just under a 50:50 chance of the cancer recurring within 5 years. Is the 6 months of treatment and SEs, both short term and long term, worth me and my family going through for such a minimal gain? I have tnbc, so hormonal treatments are not an option. I will need radio therapy either way. My consent form is signed, so the paper work is all in place for chemo to begin, but I came out of that meeting so upset and confused. I don't know what to do for the best at the moment. I have a lot more questions I need answers to, and thanks to the weather / New Year... I've not been able to go back to ask them yet (although I have emailed them to my BCN, it helped just to write them down). A positive mental attitude is really important to me, but at the moment mine is blown out of the water and I can't make a rational decision. I know I need more info, but I can't start this treatment unless I am convinced it is worthwhile. Is there anyone out there who decided against chemo and is happy with their choice?",

      "Content": "Hi Helen, Thanks for your reply. I hope your radio therapy went well and you are feeling OK. Some people seem to think I'm looking a gift horse in the mouth by questioning whether I should have chemo, but I am concerned about the short term gain vs the potential long term effects. This BBC article on a recent MacMillan report sums up my worries. I hope others find it useful too. http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/8429995.stm Jude",

      "Content": "I've been back to see my Oncologist and BCN today and I am a lot happier now I have answers to my questions. Sadly my husband works away and was not able to get back, thanks to the snow, so although we've talked on the phone, we need some time for today's info to sink in and hopefully discuss things face to face soon. Even so, I feel much more in control of my own destiny today. Yes there are long term side effects. For some of the things I was concerned about, there are no adequate studies to provide robust answers yet, but for other things, e.g heart disease and osteoporosis, the long term risks are nowhere near as bad as I was envisgaing. Still some big decisions to make, but I can be much more rational about them now and get some of my positive mental attitude back. Thanks for your advice and help. It really helped to get my thoughts onto this forum and to hear what others are thinking.",

      "Content": "Hi Zena, I know how you feel. I was initially told I would not need chemo, just ops & RT, but after my ops, they \"changed their mind\". I had the same chemo regime that you are having. Towards the end of that I was told I'd need 3 weeks of RT followd by 1 extra week of targeted RT, so 4 weeks in total. I coped with this by thinking that the treatment of cancer is constantly improving and that the treatment I was told about when I started out is not necessarily the best available now. Being told you need something different is frustrating but it does not need to be a set back. My treatement all finished in the middle of August and as I had TNBC, there is no drug therapy available. I am due to have routine screening in November and I have no reason to think that anything else is needed. However, coming to the end of treatment is like leaving school or college. Up until then you have had a plan in your diary (even if it changes with time) and support from professionals, but at the end of treatment you are lauched back into the world and have to find your own way. Just like leaving school It's helped me to look at life after treatment this way, but I do still have the odd wobble. Hope this helps  ",

      "Content": "Hi Susann, Your reaction to Docetaxel sounds to have been horrendous, how are your hands now? I hope the medication for the burning was effective. I can't let you know my experiences of chemo, as I've not made up my mind whether to have it or, although the consent is signed so the paperwork is out of the way if I do decide it is appropriate for me. I'd also love to hear the experiences of other tnbc girls out there. Are you due to have radio therapy? Good luck with your last chemo and the rest  of your journey.",
