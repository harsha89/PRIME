    "Content": "Hi, my mother who had breast cancer in 2002 was told early in 2007 that it had spread to the liver where she had FEC which was very good in suppressing the lesions on the liiver, she then went on to hormone which also was helping but unfortunately a recent CT scan has said that the lesions are getting bigger again, she is about to start on Paclitaxel (Taxol) for eighteen weeks she will be having chemo every week and will have a scan in between to see how she is getting on. I really wish your sister and your family the very best when you see the consultant. I know it is very hard to deal with and I am new to this site so can imagine how you feel. Love Lin",
