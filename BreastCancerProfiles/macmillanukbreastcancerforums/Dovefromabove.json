      "Content": "Hi there, it is totally understandable how you're feeling, it's been 2 years since I had the (to everyone else's mind the \"all clear\"), removal of the tumour. Since then I have been thinking and feeling a lump in the other side. My surgeon has told me that sometimes with radiotherapy it can cause a shadow on the opposite side, this has not stopped me from feeling that he is wrong even though my mammogram last week was normal. I really think that once you've had a diagnosis. Basically your body has misbehaved so we find it hard to trust it again. What I'd say is trust your consultant, they're amazing and will tell you in a heart beat if there's anything they need to address. ",

      "Content": "I had the cold cap for all of my chemo sessions and whilst I actually cried in one (as my usual nurse was not there ,yes I actually cried and I am not a crier) I would have it again. I found it. Really uncomfortable and upsetting but I was very lucky that my hair thinned very much but I had thick hair, so those who didn't know me had no idea. Xx yes it is horrid and it still gives me a sick feeling even thinking about but still think I'd have it again ",
