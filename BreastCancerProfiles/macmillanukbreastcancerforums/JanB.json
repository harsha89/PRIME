    "Content": "I have just been diagnosed with Inflammatory Breast Cancer. If your symptoms mirror mine then please don't wait. Be polite but insist that you are seen as soon as possible. I found that many of the medical staff I talked to had never heard of IBC and did not know the symptoms. The radiologist told me I had mastitis even though my GP had already ruled it out. Like you I was originally given an appointment for May. After taking advice about IBC I rang the hospital and asked to speak to the secretary of the breast clinic. She arranged for me to speak to the consultant and my appointment was brought forward when I described my symptoms to him. I was seen within a few days and had my biopsy and ultrasound with the results the same day. My right breast is swollen, red and hot most of the time, although the heat comes and goes. I get shooting pains but the most obvious sign is that the nipple is turning in and I have an area around the nipple where the skin is discoloured and looks like orange peel. This site is very useful and has pictures for comparison. http://www.ibcresearch.org/pictures/ Good luck and I hope you won't be joining the club.",
