      "Content": "Hi Smoothie, sorry to hear your appointment didn't go well. I hope you have a better appointment on Tues and get the news you hope for.  I too am reluctant to have chemo (as I'm sure we all are) so really want to understand the pros and cons.  Now I know that only one lymph node was affected I'm sad that all were removed but even now I'm not clear if there was any other option once they knew it was in one.   its really helpful to hear others experiences. I'm realising how little I know and it's difficult to sometimes know the correct questions to ask. I wouldn't have known about Oncotype DX test so will look into this, so thanks for the tip. happy Sunday all xx",

      "Content": " Hi. I'm new to this. I had surgery twoweeks ago and had a lumpectomy and axillary node clearance. I get the results tomorrow and I'm very nervous and can't really tell anyone for fear that they will get anxious or tell me to \"be positive\" which for the most part I have tried to be. However reality is setting in and it might not be great. I've already been told that I'll have radiotherapy and am likely to have chemotherapy first which I'm dreading so am hoping the results will be good enough for it not to be required. I don't even feel unwell and was lucky enough for it to be picked up on my first ever mammogram. I don't think the shock has worn off- I never expected my mammogram to be anything but routine and that didn't turn out so well. Any coping tips would be appreciated.",

      "Content": "Thanks Crystal. Congrats on your recent results. I'm sure it will feel more manageable once I have a plan. It's all so uncertain at the moment. A salesman was trying to sell me and my husband a holiday club membership and when I said I couldn't commit (my husband then decided to say I was having cancer treatment and everything was a bit uncertain at the moment) he acted as if I was already dead , but at least it stopped the sales patter so there's an upside. thanks for the support. I shall try and get some sleep and face the day tomorrow xx ",

      "Content": "Thanks all for the tips and support.  Just back from getting results and the margins were clear from the lumpectomy and only one node out of 25 was affected so I'm feeling very relieved. The cancer was grade 2, when they had originally said grade 1 after the biopsy but the lump is gone. Still recommending chemo and I will be meeting the oncologist in two week's to discuss  I'm realising that this journey is full of ups and downs and interminable waiting. i would never have thought 6 weeks ago that hearing that there was only cancer in one node would make me happy. I hope I'm not being overly optimistic, but it feels better than what I was imagining  before the results. Funny old world. Xx",
