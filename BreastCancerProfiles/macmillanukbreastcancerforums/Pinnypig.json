      "Content": "I've been told the results of both are similar but is that in general? Both my mum and maternal grandfather died from breast cancer. I'm not eligible for genetic screening and now I have been diagnosed with cancer they say it's a moot point.  They say because I caught it early that a lumpectomy and radiotherapy is enough but am I at an increased risk of recurrence due to family history and should opt for a mastectomy.  Oh and if I have a mastectomy  would I still need radiotherapy?",

      "Content": "Thanks for your reply I really appreciate it. I will call the hospital tomorrow and ask some more questions. I just felt it was useful to gage someone else's opinion in the meantime. I'm booked in for pre ops next tuesday and I feel a little rushed to make a decision as I'm scheduled for surgery on the 5th. I'm still breastfeeding and struggling to decide whether I keep them as my daughter will be LIVID lol or if keeping them will mean i'll be paranoid about it coming back even though I am aware of the statistics. From one minute to the next I change my mind completely!!! I don't think I've had to make a decision like this before. I thought the tiles for the kitchen was bad :)",

They will be checking my lymph nodes. Its two lumps in the right side so I've been told if the did a mx it would just be the right side the 6 months later if I wanted the other one off, I could. I'm not sure if I like the sound of it being so drawn out. XXX",
