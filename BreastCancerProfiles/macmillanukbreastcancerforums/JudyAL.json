      "Content": "I have to make a decision on having radiotherapy or not. I had a left mastectomy and just completed chemo.  At my Oncology appt last week we discussed the side effects of radiotherapy and I was rather alarmed at the potential damage to my heart and lungs, albeit rare. Can anyone offer any advise? Has anyone suffered these side effects and if so how have they affected you?   Thanks in anticipation.",
