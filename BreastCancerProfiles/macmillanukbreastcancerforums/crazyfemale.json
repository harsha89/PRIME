      "Content": "Hi LOuise, Thats a tough one. I am in a similar situation. A week ago today i had a bi-lateral (both sides) mastectomy. I saw the surgeon in clinic yesterday who has referred me to the oncologist next week. I was told, the oncologist will want to chat with you and you will decide together if you should have chemo and that i would probably be given the choice. I am 45 and my nodes were also clear! What are we meant to do? they are the experts and they should tell us if we need it. When do you see him again? Let me know how you get on and i will keep you posted as to what i am told.......... lets hope we can help each other on this one. Carole xxx",

      "Content": "Hi Carole. How strange.... same name, scans and biopsy on same day, same results and surgery in same week! It is a lot for us to get our heads round, i am the same with the sleepless nights, also very tearful all the time. I have long hair too, an unusual gold and blonde kinda colour. Its taken me ages to grow it long and like you, am worried about losing it, although, one lady replied to me on here with a really positive comment. She said, she lost her hair and wore a wig. Now her hair has grown back she said she is not liking having to get up half hour earlier to style her hair before she goes out!  It may sound a bit flippent but when i read that comment it kinda made me chuckle and think.... Yeah, i spend ages in the morning doing my hair.. at least i will have more time! Our hair will grow back.   The thoughts in our head are the hardest thing because, dont know about you, but i always think the worst and the what ifs. Its also the fact of not knowing what will happen next. Once surgery is done we will get our heads around that, then we will have to face the next challenge. I hope we can stay in touch and it might help us both if we can share our experiences.   Good luck and take care Carole xxx",

They have said they will do mine same time as mastectomy........all sounds a bit much all at once to me, but i guess its better to get it over and done with in one go! How are you now? Have you been given the all clear or are you still having treatment? I have been given a provisional date for 6th April, so like you, it will only be a couple of weeks after the results. I just have to speak to the surgeon on Monday about the reconstruction then they will book me in. I cant seem to take it all in at the mo and keep thinking im going to wake up out of a nightmare..........keep feeling very tearful as well. I guess thats all part of the shock! PLease do keep in touch and let me know how you are getting on. I hope you dont mind, but i have sent you a friend request!!   Take care Carole xx",

I think it is the not knowing that is the hardest part really, once you start treatment you know you're on the road to recovery. Good luck to you and hope all goes well with your treatment.

The only thing i did feel was an occasional shiver down my spine from the cold so will just take a jumper along next time. As yet, but its only just over a week, i have not lost a single hair............. dont know how long it will last tho' Good luck for Wednesday and please, let me know about your experience.
