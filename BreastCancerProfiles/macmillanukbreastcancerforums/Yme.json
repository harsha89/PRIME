      "Content": "Hi Mandz1001, Sorry to hear you are still in a lot of pain. Like Leolady suggests contact your BN. They will be able to reassure you.  I am almost 5 weeks post op having had a Lumpectomy & Sentinel node biopsy. I found doing the exercises they gave us helped ease the swelling, mine was always worse in the evening , it's fluid build up, called Seroma. I did contact my BN about my swollen breast & she said if it wasn't too uncomfortable to continue as I was. They don't like to stick needles in to drain them if not needed. I tried loads of bras too but the only comfortable one was the one I was given after surgery, soft front fastening. Thankfully it didn't take too much drying.  Waiting for the results is very stressful, I had to wait 4 weeks for mine! Like you I have been tired & forgetful but since my results I am much better although still a little tired. Try not to think too much about the negatives. What will be will be and there's not a lot we can do about things. Just go with the flow, try & keep your mind occupied. Lots of lovely posts on here for you to read & lots of lovely people like Leolady giving sound advice to us all.  Sending hugs xx",

Been lucky so far only slightly sore and pinkish and hot, had some stabbing at times but told that is the nerves repairing themselves. Don't you see the oncologist or surgeon again too? Good luck anyway & thanks for the support you have given me. Take care Sending extra hugs xx",

So despite my love of swimming & Aquafit I will be keeping out for a few weeks after tomorrow's final Aquafit session. First zap on Thursday for me.  Hope everyone else is getting on ok Hugs to you all x",

I too have been lucky with side effects.Only slightly sore & hot.  I'm on Letrozole and am getting occasional hot flushes too, as though I'm not already hot enough lol. Haven't had the results from my Dexa scan yet, perhaps I ought to go see my GP. Joints are a bit stiff at times especially first thing but probably just my age. Let us know how it goes. Take care.

      "Content": "Leolady56 what you say about scars is so true. I am a regular swimmer. As you say there are so many choices in swimwear & I have several which cover my scars. But the changing rooms are my downfall. I have always undressed amongst my fellow swimmers but now I feel embarrassed & want to hide in the cubicles. Silly I know but I have managed to overcome the cubicles & just keep an extra towel wrapped around me. ( Is that really just as bad?) I wont be going for a while so no need to worry. But as you rightly say why should I worry?",

      "Content": "Hi Leolady56 & everyone,     I commence my 3 weeks of RT on 12 July. Not looking forward to the 70 mile round trip each day, but I keep telling myself I am one of the lucky ones! I had my planning appointment last week & when I asked about creams they told me it's best to moisturise with whatever you are used to and not to use anything new. Also that the best way to keep your skin moisturised is to drink lots of water, as mentioned already. I am dark skinned (well I was before turning white)I hope my skin doesn't burn too much.  I am currently trying to fit in a few Aquafit sessions before the pool ban of 6 weeks! I really love to get in the swimming pool especially when it's hot weather!  Anyway Good Luck everyone will be reading with interest all your comments & experiences.  My new saying \"Always look on the bright side of life!\" Sending hugs to you all xx",

Looks like those complaints have been taken on board Leolady56.  I only have the time for my first session next Thursday at 12.10. Apparently they give me the rest on that day.

Was told today at pre zap talk that I could go swimming for a few days if I wanted as it doesn't usually affect the skin until about 3rd zap. He also recommended cavilon moisturiser. Worst part of it today was having my arms up for so long at least tomorrow should be over quicker. Well night everyone take care. ",

I found it very informative, but think it is best to go before starting RT.  It covers all Radiotherapy patients & they go through what it is the machines do and what to expect as regards side effects. There is time to ask questions either in group or 1 to 1 over coffee. The group was presented by a McMillan nurse, Radiotherapist & Physiotherapist. Loads of McMillan booklets available on all aspects of treatment. I had a WLE so lucky compared to you. I too purchased M&S bras & agree about the pockets irritating. As soon as I'm home, it's off.  Good luck with the rest of your journey x",
