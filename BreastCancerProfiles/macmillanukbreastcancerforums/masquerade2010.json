      "Content": "hi, thanks for your reply and yes the waiting is the killer, you try to analyse every word they say, I did nurse my husband right up to his last breath with the wonderful help of macmillans, right up to his last breath, after which I washed and shaved him ( i was an auxiliary nurse). I attended all the visites and it was dire and inoperable from the start, i guess this leaves me with a jaded view of the process and illness. I hope for good news but try to prepare for the worst xx",

      "Content": "HI Crogg, thanks for your reply. I spoke today to a breast nurse and told her my partner could not come but did she think it was necessary for me to have someone with me. She said let me look at your notes,  then said they didnt have all the results but they would by tomorrow and it is a good idea to bring someone with me as i may not take it all in. Dont think that sounds quite so great :( still, fingers crossed its a good update tomorrow ",

      "Content": "Hi everyone, i have been perusing the website over the ast 2 weeks or so when I first began this awful journey.I am after some advice opinions really. I found quite a large indefinite  lump in my breast around 21 days ago. i was referred to the breast clinic 2 weeks ago and at first the doctor said, from the mammogram, he thought it was a cyst. However when he did the ultra sound it did not look as he thought it would so biopsies were taken and the cyst was ruled out. the consultant said it was not typical of a tumour as most of it was smooth but there was a ragged area to it.She said in truth they were unsure what it was.  today the breast nurse called and left a message . she said it was nothing to worry about but an appointment had been made for me to get my results  in 2 days time. now my question is, if it was a bad result would she say thet? is she just trying to stop panic? do  you go to the clinic for benign results.  I am at the point where i just want to know! my husband died of esophageal cancer at the age of 38 and all this waiting brings all the anxiety and uncertainty back. just would like to hear peoples thoughts, thanks",

      "Content": "returned to this post today. soory I replied to no one yesterday, i spiralled to a very dark place full of fear and self loathing but today I woke up calm and ready to face my new future. I will read through all the lovely shows of support on Monday. It is my daughters 21st this weekend and we plan to celebrate with a 7 mile country pub crawl followed by a meal  . I want a few days where I am just me unaffected by my bodies little mishap.I have pasted a post I put on my facebook page to show where I am at and I plan to start a blog which I think I will find therapeutic...have a lovely weekend evreyone xx CANCER, yes that horrible word that installs fear in us all, I have it in my breast. However I will refuse to let it define my life from today. I admit it sent me to a very dark place for a couple of days but today I have woken up calm and no I will not battle, my body is not a battle ground, it is something to nurture and love. I have decided i will not, in my mind use the word cancer or even more horrendous carcinoma, it has such a negative connotation. They are just a few breast cells that have gone off piste and decided to multiply to fast. They are still a part of me and my breast is not let me down, it is still the same one that nursed my children and attracted attention. Further more I am not a victim of it, it did not single me out and to be a victim implies helplessness. I am its companion for a short while. I will start treatment soon and I am glad I do not need chemo. I must thank all my family, especially the kids and my rock, pete for their support whilst I wobbled as i took on board the new chapter life has thrown at us. also the kind words and gestures of friends old and new, it has touched me.",
