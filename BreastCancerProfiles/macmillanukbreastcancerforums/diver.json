    "Content": "Hi , my sister used the cold cap 3 years ago whilst having 6 sessions of Fec T . It works and works well in my opinion . Her hair thinned a little but she certainly did not loose it . It is not very comfortable ( in fact she said it was quite painful to start with ) it also means and extra 2 hrs approx to each session but if keeping your hair is important to you then try it , you can always stop using it later if it's not for you . Take Care x",
