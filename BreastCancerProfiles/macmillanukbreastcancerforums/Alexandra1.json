      "Content": "I had a large piece of tissue removed due to a radial scar being dodgy and a duct excision on the other side two weeks ago nearly. I was doing well but the radial scar side has become infected and swollen my breast up to twice its normal size. My underarm is very painful and theres a very red area on the sewn up bit. I got antibiotics at the walk in centre and co codamol but feel very sore and a bit scared frankly. I see the surgeon for follow up and results on wednesday. Wondering how long its going to take before I am healed. Seems a long time to be out of action.",

      "Content": "Hi. Feeling afraid this evening as got a copy of the letter send to my GP by breast surgeon. It says that I will be put on the MDT which I think is bad after my vaccum biopsy which I had last week and am waiting for the results and that it is likely they will reccomment a total bilateral duct excision and also thatbi have a b3 radial scar. Anyone had any of this done and any advice at all would be great. Thank you.x",
