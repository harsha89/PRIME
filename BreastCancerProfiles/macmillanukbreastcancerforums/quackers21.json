    "Content": "Hi everyone, I have a friend in Norway who has just been diagnosed and had a lumpectomy.She is starting on Chemo, however she has only been in Norway just over a year so as you can imagine the language is something of a problem. I'm thinking that if someone who speaks the language could perhaps help out with a bit of translation. If could be that person please make contact. thanks and all the best to everyone.",
