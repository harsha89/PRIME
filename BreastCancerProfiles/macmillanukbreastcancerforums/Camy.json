    "Content": "Have been taking Letrozole for just over a year and have learnt to live with the side affects of aching and some fatigue.  Have been told be my BCN that this is normal and hopefully things will improve ...if not you just have to get used to it.  Unfortunately I cannot take any alternative medication. I wonder if anyone knows, or has experienced, whether the consumption of any alcohol has a negative reaction with the medication?  I have been told recently that alcohol increases oestrogen and thus would it conflict with the Letrozole ?  Also is there any evidence that turmeric capsules taken twice a day could also cause a negative reaction ?  or whether glucosamine and chondrotrine is safe to take with Letrozole ?  Any thoughts greatly appreciated.  Thanks",
