      "Content": "Hi Londonlass I am due for mastectomy at the end of Jan followed by some nodes removal. I am reading lots of useful stuff here and trying to benefit from other's experiences.Â  May I ask what is cording? and how does it occur? The thought of getting lymphoedema scares me. I was so glad to get through FEC-T chemo and now psyching myself up for surgery and RT. I was looking fwd to finishing all treatments and get back to my old life. But after reading about lymphoedema, I started to believe that cancer will change my life forever if I focus on it and other things that can happen. However, I will not let cancer do that. I will have to be more careful and observant of course but determined to stay living an active life and stay hopeful and positive. Good luck to us all and to those looking after cancer patients. Keep focusing on that light at the end of the tunnel.",
