    "Content": "Hi all, I know this is an old post but I\u2019m experiencing similar issues and I\u2019m getting very paranoid. I\u2019m 19, and over a month ago I had a red mark on my breast, I monitored it as it changed and it went away after a week or so. Then I noticed my nipples changing. The end of both nipples have about 15-20 white specks on, and the Montgomery glands are more prominent, and touching them causing a prickly sensation. This went away but I\u2019ve just noticed they\u2019ve come back. I\u2019m definitely not pregnant, nor have I ever been. I\u2019m just getting a little paranoid about them, and doctors aren\u2019t open at the weekend. Oh the joys.  Sorry for the long message, just needed to let out my worries and concerns!  Edit: I just squeezed to see if anything came out and white stuff came out, is it possible these are just whiteheads and I\u2019m making myself paranoid over nothing?",
