      "Content": "Hi Dee, Just finished 15 sessions of radiotherapy, don't know if I'm one of the lucky ones but I feel fine, make sure your have plenty of E45 which you can get on prescription and put it on twice a day. It was a little tired but I think that was the fact I had to go every day. Good luck",

      "Content": "They removed a 5mm and 1mm (at the top of the breast)  together difference between 13mm and have now found a 4mm and 1mm (under the breast) . Why did they not see all 4 on the Mammogram and MRI scan it's not like I've had another scan they are looking at the same scan taken 8weeks ago ? I am seeing my Oncology next week to discuss radiotherapy which may be delayed if I need further surgery.  Should I now be thinking of a mastectomy? Help and advise would be very helpful Pat",

      "Content": "Can anyone tell me if they have had similar problems.  I had my first mammogram on 6th March recall for biopsy on 26th March - results on 8th April with MRI scan had a phone call stating everything was okay one lump and nothing in my LN - day of surgery 3rd May wire  inserted and injection went back to the ward only to be told I needed to go back because they had found another lump, so another wire was inserted everything was taken away and margins were clear nothing in the LN.  5th June had a phone call they wanted me back at the hospital that day to discuss my MRI scan which was done on the 8th April, stated they had found another two lumps, so I'm back at the hospital on the 10th not sure was going to happen.  I just wanted to know should they have picked up all 4 lumps on the 1st Mammogram and the MRI scan. ?

I have now been given Letrozol which I have been on for a couple of months  and the pain down my leg first thing in the morning is horrendous, hot flushes and burning mouth, having been told you have cancer was bad enough but the medication is even worse. I have made an appointment with my consultant i'm going to discuss coming off the tablets can't cope with all the side effects im getting with them.",
