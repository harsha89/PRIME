If you google NHS Predict you can put your details in and get a rough idea of benefit the Chemo and Herceptin give your type, grade cancer. As results are improving so fast with these treatments with the full works our chances are probably better than on the predict. I always want to make decisions on the statistics but that is the way I cope and I know I have given myself the best chance. Good luck with your decision making. Lin x",

Right at the beginning of my treatment a good friend said \u201c you have to proactively handle your treatment\u201d and I have found that so useful, I am charming, polite but firm and this has been needed a few times without pushing anyone\u2019s back against a wall.

      "Content": "I totally agree with toxophilite, it doesn\u2019t matter how busy they are there is no excuse. I saw an inept registrar who don\u2019t read my notes twice and I phoned the consultant\u2019s secretary and politely asked if I could see the consultant as I had so many unanswered questions. I did see the consultant next time and she was charming and thorough  even though she always runs nearly an hour late. To overhear the consultant telling the registrar to hurry up is inexcusable and a polite but firm complaint to the consultant saying what happened might be very effective, especially saying what you overheard. If you complain to PALs it becomes official, try the consultant first as that allows them time to get it right and you can escalate it later if there is a poor response. I was surprised at my very young, inexperienced registrar and checked, they are not registrars as we know them, I.e doctors who have done 2 years as house officers and then are trainee consultants, they are doctors who may have even only done a year as a junior house officer since qualifying and really know less about breast cancer than some of us  on this site. The consultant\u2019s secretary as much as admitted to me that they were not happy with the registrar I saw but after 6 months he was moving on and the new one was much better, as I saw him for my inital avaluation and two follow up appointment, not very encouraging. The good thing is your treatment plan is decided by a multi disciplinary team and not by the registrar, if he read your notes he would know what the plan was. Sorry about the rant but after 43 years in medicine I know that not reading the notes is a cardinal sin. Lin ",

      "Content": "Hi Commonoer I though that I would give you another opinion, I had a mastectomy and axillary clearance March 2017 and have been told that I can't have a reconstruction until the end of this year as I have had radiotherapy (I also had chemotherapy). I am medium size and have coped really well with a prosthesis, definitely need mastectomy bras and a good one seems to be vital. Amoena and Nicola Jane do them, look at their catalogue on line and if you phone them they are incredibly helpful. I was given an Amoena prosthetic on the NHS so the best quality and it looks very natural when I am dressed, I am also going to try their contact prosthesis (stick on) a year after radiotherapy, Amoena's advice. I am really not sure if I am going to have a delayed reconstruction but I am  trying to get the best results without and that may help my decision, I haven't tried swimming yet with the special swim prosthetic but my mastectomy is my right side and I am back playing tennis, I hit the ball remarkably well considering what my chest and arm have been through and with a good mastectomy sports bra the prosthetic does not shift. I am going to have my reconstruction appointment and then decide I was like you, wanted all the facts first, I do hope all goes well best wishes LIn x",

I was diagnosed with grade 3 invasive ductal breast cancer last February, had  mastectomy with axillary node clearance in March, FEC-T and radiotherapy finishing at the end of October, I am still having Herceptin and zometa and have felt that I have coped remarkably well, I do get tired but I have resumed gentle tennis, my role as Sunday school teacher and generally trying to get on with life, I retired just before my diagnosis. I bumped into a tennis friend who has been very sweet during my treatment but due to bad weather I havent played tennis for the last few weeks, the ice, snow and cold are a bit daunting and so I haven\u2019t seen her. I got the usual, you look well (I wish I did feel as good as everyone keeps telling me I look!) and then she said \u201cyou must be nearly back to normal now\u201d. I can\u2019t believe how much that upset me, I think people assume cancer treatment is just like a bad dose of flu, I started to explain that at times I still struggle but it almost sounded like I was whining. I don\u2019t blame this particular friend, she doesn\u2019t aalways understand what is happening in other people\u2019s lives but it makes me worry that all of my friends who have been kind have the same idea that you finish treatment and the are instantly better. Am I being a whimp? Lin x",

      "Content": "Dear Ivy Thank you for your lovely reply, I have been moaning a lot the last few weeks and some of that is probably to do with having some energy to spare after treatment. I felt awful after the last T, it is cumulative and you are just so wiped out, nearly every aspect of my blood test was abnormal and I struggled. When you get to 3 weeks and you would have been due the next treatment it gradually dawns on you that you don\u2019t have to do that again. I struggled with fatigue for 2 months after the end of radiotherapy but then really started picking up after a Christmas so give yourself time. This is when the little pixies in your brain start stirring things up and I have got grumpy and cross over silly things, all normal I think but I have been silly to let one person\u2019s thoughtless remark upset me. Thanks for your empathy and kind words ladies Lin x",

I think I am well enough now to have all the up and down emotions whereas before I was just in survival mode of getting through each bit.

My last one was given by a lovely nurse who really did it slowly and surprisingly no red hot thigh and very little side effects, guidelines say it should be given over 2-5 minutes and maybe slow delivery helps, I am going to ask for that next week. I am doing so much more than a few months ago and as I am retired I try and stop, rest and even sleep for an hour after lunch most days and it really helps me to enjoy the rest of the day.

I had a mastectomy with lymph node clearance, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, Herceptin, ongoing zometa and letrozole. I finished my Herceptin at the end of July and now feel well. I am on the waiting list for a DIEP reconstruction next March but still a bit undecided. When I was first diagnosed I was scared, shocked and in total denial and I found this chat group wonderfully helpful and occasionally scary. I want to say to you ladies at the beginning or even half way through their treatment, you will get through it, take it a step at a time and the hard times will pass and you will reclaim your life, it and you may be different but it will be good.  I have just just come back from a month motorhoming in France, I trained and qualified (with wonderful support)  during treatment as a Canterbury Cathedral assistant guide, I swim once a week, play gentle doubles tennis twice a week and according to my Fitbit, I have walked many miles. i was fit to start with but have tried to walk every day, no matter how unwell I felt. I have met some wonderful ladies from the Moving Forward course and been blown away by the love and kindness of family and friends. A few people, including one of my brothers have been unsupportive but  I no longer make a great effort with them and just value the lovely supportive ones. Please  ladies, just hang on in there, you are so much stronger than you think and this will all pass and fade.

I ordered picc sleeves from live better with cancer website, the first ones were too large but now right size, I find them comfortable and discreet.

My first consultation was with a registrar, maximum 3 years qualified as a doctor and he was fairly useless, had to go and see consultant for answers to most of my questions. I then saw the consultant on the second appointment and she was fine, knowledgeable, kind but a bit gushy and patronising. I had my third appointment yesterday, the clinic is so packed there were not enough seats and nobody gives you any eye contact or warmth. Again I saw the registrar and again he seemed to know very little and had to google!! and go and ask  consultant for answers to my questions. I asked about follow up and he said next appointment would be 6 weeks after radiation and would be my last. I said I may ask for yearly private consultations and he then suddenly said oh you are HER 2-+ve and we check you through Herceptin for a year, so my whole consultation took place without him even knowing what my cancer was. I asked when I started arimidex and he said oh yes, 4 weeks after chemo and then gave me a prescription, would I have even started if I had not asked. My confidence in this doctor who knows less about my cancer than my GP has fallen to an all time low and feeling quite vulnerable now as not sure I trust the team if I only see him. I will ask the oncology secretary if my next consultation can be with the consultant but why do we have to fight these battles on top of everything else. Sorry needed a moan, Lin",

      "Content": "Hi Volvox I finished chemo at the end of August 2017 and lost all my hair about 2 weeks post 1st Chemo, it was fallling out in handfuls so I bit the bullet and had it shaved. I had a wig which I wore once and hated, I maybe should have tried another one but instead wore hats and beanies with scarves tied around them. I think I was in total denial until I lost my hair and only really only believed I had cancer when I saw my bald head. Ok enough of the negatives, kind people were nothing but comlimentary about my headwear, I became used to how I looked and although no one but my husband saw my bald head I settled down and coped well. At Christmas I bit the bullet and bared my fluffy hair and now I have a very stylish, if rather short head of fuzz, I would like to say curls but that is a little too positive.  Losing our hair is massive but like everything else you will get on with it and hopefully the wonderful kindness of people will far outweigh the odd thoughtless remark, waiters and shop assistants give you VIP service!!! Good luck with all your treatment and you will get through it all Lin x",

I think it was you that asked about the picc line. Mine has been no trouble, easily put in and no pain from infusions or blood tests. Disadvantages are you need a Limbo, a cover available on NHS from GP for showering and you have to go to hospital or GP, if they do it, every week. I don't mind this as extra opportunity to ask questions, seek reassurance. Good luck with the chemo, I was due to have cycle 5 of FEC-T yesterday but had urinary tract infection so delayed until Monday, instead of being upset it feels like the gift of an extra weekend of feeling relatively well. It is not easy but the word doable sums it up. Love Lin ",

The radiologist said it would have shown on my CT scan but my consultant was very protective of her patients and would want me to be happy. At no time did I feel a nuisance. A friend advised me at the beginning of my treatment to proactively handle my care, which I have politely but firmly done and unless they are gritting their teeth and hiding it well no one seems too irritated with me.

I believe under NICE  guidelines any woman should be able to have reconstructive surgery if she wishes, even if it is many years later, I do know some health authorities do not comply with this.  My point is, I believe in life there are often three options in decisions like this, \u201cYes\u201d, \u201cNo\u201d or \u201cMaybe later\u201d your decision need not be final and you will not be losing the option of future surgery if you change your mind. wishing you the very best in all your upcoming treatment Lin x",

I saw only a specialist registrar (old fashioned senior house officer, could be only 2 years qualified) on my first appointment with the consultant popping in at the end and not even sitting down. I saw the consultant the second time where she patronised and gushed a bit and until yesterday have never seen her again. I tried to ask the registrar questions and he didn\u2019t know any of the answers and was dismissive of symptoms. I knew I had a appointment yesterday so I phoned the oncologist\u2019s secretary and said my questions were not being answered and I wanted to see the consultant, which I then did, she was patient and pleasant. At the beginning a friend said that I must proactively handle my care and that helps a lot. I am very polite but persist and they don\u2019t seem to hate me but that is really not the issue, they probably don\u2019t give a thought once I have left the room. You could try phoning the surgeon\u2019s secretary and say that you were rather disappointed and would your fears be allayed and your questions answered at your post op check. I don\u2019t think they are uncaring, just swamped but a gentle reminder that you are a person seems to help, we British women can be too undemanding.

I am nearly a year post diagnosis having a mastectomy, Chemo and radiotherapy, still having Herceptin and hormone suppression with anastrozole and zometa (for bones) and I firstly want to reassure you that you will cope, last year passed in a haze, just take each step at a time and then you will come out the other end truly surprised and proud of how you coped. My eldest son, a doctor suggested 2 lists, A & B. A list are those close and they get all the facts, some more honestly than others, B get just basics and we also did C, no need to know. People handle it so differently, my eldest, the doctor rather offered platitudes until I asked him not to be my doctor but my son, I don\u2019t think he coped really well with the whole thing but after visiting from Australia,where he lives, at Christmas he is better andhas done his best. My non medical middle son has been wonderful, always wanting to know everything and never letting me get away with evasion and my youngest son is almost trying to ignore it all, pretend everything is ok, don\u2019t get me wrong they have all been so loving but they are coping with their shock and emotion as well. I don\u2019t have any parents and my husband of 44 years has been truly wonderful, loving, understand and supportive. This horrible disease comes with so much emotion as well that it makes it hard but you will cope as a family in your own unique way and remember telling them is probably the hardest thing you will have to do, you will cope with the rest.

I am really sick of being a patient (pun intended) and wondered if the course was patronising as I rather resent the personal details that they want on the form. I am feeling rather rebellious recently and finding my visits to the chemo unit for Herceptin are making me cross, from the grumpy receptionist to the constant calling me by my formal name Linda which no one has used since I was aged 8 no matter how many times I ask them to call me Lin, to the long waits, 55 minutes last time when half the chairs were empty and the nurses were standing around chatting. I know myself and I tend to get cross instead of upset and feeling so much better I have the energy to be cross now!! Anyway I will bite my tongue and behave as long as I am not going to be patronised for 4 weeks on a course I don\u2019t have to do and the course is worth going to do so I would love your opinions.
