      "Content": "Hi,  Just a phone call from my genetics team saying no mutated gene found. This is good news. I am now sat here sobbing because I am all confused, I was basically advised that due to me being 37 and having bi lateral breast cancer two different types so both primary and a family history of breast and ovarian cancers then it' almost certain to be genetic, now I am just unlucky. Over the last few weeks / months awaiting the results and under going chemo, I have come to terms with a double mastectomy but now don't even know if this is an option.  Will I be told that my only option is lumpectomy with regular checks???  Very confused and seriously don' think I could go through treatment again, my breast don' feel like mine anymore, they feel empty (of that makes sense)  Has anyone else experienced anything like this????  Many Thanks  Kirst x",

As you can imagine I am not best pleased and said I want a mastectomy as it' in both breats and different types of cancer.  I know have to wait till Tuesday and hope this appt is not cancelled and fight my corner. Only problem is I know next week is my bad week and often struggle to make the school run let alone a 9am hospital appt lol.  keep in touch  Kirst x",

My anxiety is through the roof, I just. we'd to know what operation they are going to do although I am still going to push for double mastecomy, think if it was only in one breast the a lumpectomy would be ok but as its bilateral I just want them gone.  Hope your doing ok  Kirsty x",

I have done 6 chemo cycles and and now preparing for double mastectomy.  Well, that was till last week, following pre op exam, I now have to have another ultrasound and ct scan as the think it' not started in lymph?  I have two young daughters and at the start of this journey I went out of my mind worrying for them and how are we going to through this, the bottom line is you find a way!!! Please trybtonstay positive. you are going to have good and bad days and that is totally fine but try and make memories and have family time when you feel up to it. Good luck on your journey and remember you are stronger than you think  xc",

      "Content": "Hello,  I also have a needle phobia aswell and must say you are doing better than me as you managed a pic line. I stress every 3 weeks and have anti anxiety tablets just for the cannua and once it' in I put a cloth over it and pretend it' not there. I have bilateral breast cancer and both sites have a marker, mine were done pre chemo.  Please don't stress, compared to having a biopsy it's minor. Mindfulness helps. I am on chemo 5 out of 6 and have made the decision for double mastectomy purely for fear of it coming back especially as its currently in both boobs, two different types. If a lumpectomy is what you want then please don't over think the markers, tell staff that you are anxious and they will put you at ease.  I took my friend with me for mine As usually pass out but this time I never, just kept my eyes closed and asked the specialist not to talk me through what he was doing and just get on with. You will be fine xx",

I am normally the glass is half full sort of person but since chemo it changed to half empty. It's a major rough ride but please try to stay positive and remember it's all for the greater good xx Keep talking to people and remember to Llow yourself little treats, even if it's just having your nails done xx  Always here  Kirst xx",
