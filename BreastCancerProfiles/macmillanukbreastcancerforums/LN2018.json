      "Content": "Hello all. I have an appointment with my breast clinic on a Thursday but I\u2019ve noticed a change with the dent in my right breast tonight that has me even more panicked. I\u2019ll start by saying I have breast implants too, which makes this even more confusing as I keep switching between wondering whether the implant is acting up, or if it\u2019s something sinister. I have a large dent under my nipple that is huge and clearly visible when I lean back. It\u2019s also more apparent when I move my arm, and palpable to touch at all times. I have been to my plastic surgeon who has said the implant is intact, well positioned, and with no capsular contraction. I now have puckering skin along the line of the dent. Has anyone\u2019s BC ever started like this? My mum had leukaemia 4 years ago, my brother testicular Cancer last year and I just don\u2019t think my family can deal with another blow! If anyone has any similar stories? Thanks, Luce x",
