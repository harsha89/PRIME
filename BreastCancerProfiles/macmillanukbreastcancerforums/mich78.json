      "Content": "Evening All, I'm so worried, I'm making myself feel ill. I found a large lump in my left breast on Friday. Managed to get an appointment with my gp that afternoon. I had a phone call Friday teatime telling me my appointment is a week Tuesday. The thing that's playing on my mind is, 8 years ago I had a cyst, the doctor told me that's what she thought it was and not to worry. This time she said 'yep I can feel what you can feel and that was it. This lump feels so diffent to the last one and is so much bigger. Am I just being daft, how can I stop worry. ",
