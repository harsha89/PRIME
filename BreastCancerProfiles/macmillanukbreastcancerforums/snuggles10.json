At the moment I am for the first time knitting socks on 5 needles. Learning from the internet. Made the first one and its fine working on the second. Saw a lady at the breast clinic who makes beautiful fair isle style socks for the local hospice she was knitting as she was waiting for her appointment. Trying to keep busy with crafting. I have until July to wait for another biopsy. I must have the longest wait in history between biopsy`s, My first was at the end of February which caused a hematoma and infection. 7 weeks on still got both. Will need to ring doctors next week as I am not getting much better from the infected wound however hematoma has reduced. Keep crafting x",

      "Content": "Hi, I had my first biopsy on 23 February 2018.  Suspicious mammogram but biopsy came back clear, result received on 6 March. However the hospital wanted another biopsy as mammogram suspicious. Went back on 7 March but because of a hematoma they couldn't do it. Was given another appointment for 9 April for biopsy But due to size of hematoma, infection and lots of bleeding went back to the hospital on 28 March As the hematoma is large, I have now been told the next biopsy will be delayed an will now be at the start of July At first thought if it is a cancer it will be very early, and this delay will be ok. 3 months waiting is a long time, but I understand they need another tissue sample and this cannot be done with the hematoma. Now I am getting anxious thinking if I have cancer will it grow quickly in these 3 months? Does anyone know how long a very early stage cancer takes to grow?",

You are all amazing people. I wish I could be strong. I feel alone and frightened, not knowing what my outcome will be, is causing me to go into a very dark place. I have nobody to give me a hug, be with me, talk to me, understand me. This morning I have decided, to stop talking about it as I think everyone is fed up about what I feel like. Thanks everyone on here for your kind words and helpful advise. You are all awesome xx So thanks everyone,",
