    "Content": "Hi. Me too I had to give up breastfeeding sooner because of breast cancer. I'm 31 years old and have a 5 years old girl and a 12 months old baby boy. I've been diagnosed 2 months ago I had already 3 sessions of chemo.  My operation is going to happen after the chemo and I got 3 more sessions to do once every 3 weeks. Please tell me about the surgery cause in my case also the lymph nodes are going to be removed also my whole breast. With the kids is fine for now but I'm very worried for the period after the operation. Kisses.  Manu",
