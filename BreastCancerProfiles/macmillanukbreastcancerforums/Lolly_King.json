      "Content": "Hello, like I said before just remember to take nice slow deep breathes and don't feel worried about telling the medical team how you are feeling. I was worried about the blue dye and I told the nurse and she really calmed my fears. No question or worry is silly to them. It's normal to feel scared before surgery so it's good to remember that too. I'm in a state at the moment as my chemo starts tomorrow. I'm at the point of totally backing out of it because I'm so frightened. I can't sleep and I feel sick and have pictured all sorts of scenarios in my head of what can go wrong and how ill I might feel, so I understand just how awful severe anxiety can be but I promise you the surgery you're having, you will wake up and after a few hours you will wonder why you got yourself so worked up. Once in theatre just tell them you feel very scared and they will help you and you will be asleep before you know it and I honestly had no pain afterwards just some strange shooting pains every so often but that lasts seconds. I will be thinking of you. It's awful isn't it feeling like this? Lots of love to you",

      "Content": "I am so pleased you made it and that it wasn't as bad as you thought it would be. Just look after yourself and don't get too frustrated if you are not as active for a while. My chemo was cancelled as I have a gum infection from a tooth extraction so I have been put on antibiotics and try again next week. I had made myself sick during the night with nerves so I can't believe that I have to go through all that again!! Take care xx",
