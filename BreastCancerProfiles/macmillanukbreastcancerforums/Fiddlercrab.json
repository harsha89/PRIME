The lump came back positive for cancer but the microcalcifications turned out to be nothing. But they weren't associated with any unusual lumpiness, just general normal (for me) lumpiness. The biopsy will go off to be examined by the pathologist and at your appointment they'll tell you what it is. It's good to be prepared for bad news, that will definitely make it easier to accept, and anything less is a bonus. If it is cancer, they'll discuss the treatment plan with you and arrange any further tests. Fingers crossed for Wednesday.",

My results weren't due until next week, when I have an appointment booked with my surgeon. But the first thing the new man said was \"I have your results\".

Perhaps they could have one or two who focus more on the younger women. And I really want to be able to contact her by email. A lot of stuff should be available online. It can't be hard to make easy to find local information, including who your BCNs are, surely?  I like the mentor idea. I think that would help.  I agree that Mummy's Lump is pretty poor. I got that and a superhero cartoon style one aimed at older children. Neither were appropriate for my 8 year old, so we muddled through without them. I know the BCNs are Macmillan, but it would be nice to know what's on offer locally from other charities, and I want them to link up better with the chemo nurses. I feel that although the medical care is joined up (ish), the support doesn't seem to be, and it is up to us to work out what is out there that might help us. HER Breast Friends, for e.g., is a local charity and I just found out from someone on here that they have a wig bank, yet they have no apparent presence in either the breast unit or the Oncology centre, at least not that I noticed. This is is the sort of information that could easily be collated together on a website.",

I have had no problems with draining or healing (my second drain came out after 2 weeks) and am still uncomfortable, although some days are better than others. I still have soreness under my arm, especially where the drains came out, and there is still some swelling/fluid but not enough for anyone to worry about. I saw my surgeon a couple of days ago and he said that all this was to be expected, especially the tightness where he stitched the mesh. He recommended starting to massage with bio oil (or something similar) to help relax the muscle and sort out the swelling. You might want to wait a bit if you are still healing, though. I don't have a dip at the top but I do have a weird square corner at the bottom, which he thinks should disappear with massage but if it doesn't he can go back in and sort it out. My arm movement is pretty good, but I recognise the elastic band feeling (I could even see it). Just keep doing the exercises, push a little bit but not too much against the discomfort (my physio said to feel it pulling but not go as far as pain), and the nurse recommended doing the exercises after taking painkillers as that allows you to stretch more.  I am a terribly impatient patient, and this ongoing discomfort is really annoying! I am not used to not doing much for so long!",

Fruit and veg tends to taste more normal for me, while things like chips and pizza taste like dust. I have heard pineapple is good too, I've got some dried for snacking. Carolyn always suggests ice lollies, I am sure she will be along in a minute! For the pain, I have been taking loratidine, because I am not sure if it is the tax or the white cell injections. All I know is that they day after I forgot it, the pain was so much worse. You could maybe give that a go.  Some people have been swapped from 3-weekly docetaxel to weekly paclitaxel (sp?) because the lower dose means lower side effects.

It could well be that it's only the odd ones who have this weirdness, the ones who have healed up without problems aren't going to be posting on this site!  I suspect anything surgery that interferes with the chest muscle may result in weird effects. If the muscle isn't cut/damaged then it should be OK. Some types of reconstruction go in front of the muscle I think - it wasn't something I asked about as I was pretty certain I didn't want a DIEP because of the extra wounds and longer healing time (ha!). So quiz them about the specifics in relation to your running. Ask to speak to a physio first if you can, as they might have a better idea in relation to sports rather than tea-making. Not everyone needs physio. Some have it to help regain full shoulder movement after node clearance, especially if they have rads afterwards and need to get their arm above their head quite quickly. I saw a physio the day after surgery, who gave me a leaflet and explained the exercises. I'm only thinking of talking to one because I want to know if this is normal and if there is anything I can do to hurry the muscle along to a state of forgetting. On the other hand, the occupational health person at work seemed to think recovery is a lot longer than the surgical types told me, so I suspect she actually has more experience of working with people over a longer term recovery, and getting back to normal. She told me I could justifiably stay off work for 4-5 months and no one would bat an eyelid. ",

I asked the Oncologist to refer me to the physio and he said he would, but it turns out he is particularly useless at remembering to actually do things (like prescribe my Herceptin... three times in a row I have had to wait while the poor nurses scrabble around to find someone to sign off on it, and I have an 8am appointment and the first doctor gets in a 9). I am going to chase it again when I see the surgeon and I will ask the Onc again when I see him on 31st. I was going to try and self-refer but had no idea how to go about it! Maybe I will ask when I see the nurses for Herceptin next week. Thanks!",

I had a mastectomy with implant reconstruction using strattice, so they lifted my chest muscle to cover the top half of the implant, while the strattice covers the bottom half. It's relaxing down now, so there is a bit of a droop, but my chest muscle still hasn't forgotten it is a muscle and starts cramping up (like a braxton hicks!) when I try and do a little gentle jog, and I get all sorts of weird sensations when I try and swim using that arm. I put on lots of weight during chemo (which was first) and am struggling to shift it without being able to do the exercise I actually enjoy doing. I am walking quite a lot, getting my 10,000 steps nearly every day, and sometimes go for a bike ride or on the exercise bike, but I just don't like doing it.  I am seeing my surgeon in a couple of weeks for the first time since 4 weeks after surgery, so I shall be quizzing him about it. But thinking back when I asked about recovery, they were all very focused on immediate recovery, not long term, getting back to doing all the usual things. So my question is: is it normal to take his long and am I just being a terribly impatient patient again?",

I chosen an implant because of the shorter recovery time, but nothing I read or was told really prepared me for how long it actually takes to be my 'normal'. I obviously don't know where I would be at if I had decided to go for the DIEP option, but I am fairly certain I am not going to do it now. I am probably going to have to go under again for a tidy up of a weird square corner, but apart from that and the running thing, I am reasonably happy.  I did try a little jog yesterday, but after 30 seconds it felt like my boob was moving upwards and to the side (it wasn't, at least not as far as I could see, but that's what it felt like). I'm definitely going to start pestering for that physio appointment! And perhaps also feed back to the BCNs about realistic, proper recovery, rather than getting out of bed and making a cup of tea recovery. ",

When I swim or try to use it it just feels like a weird pulling. I guess it might just take longer for the muscle to 'forget' its old job and just be a boob - if that ever happens!  I was talking to another lady who had an LD recon. She said no one ever mentioned that her boob will still react like a muscle. I just don't think it really concerns the surgeons at the time, you know? I bet physios come across it all the time but it doesn't filter back into the decision making process when the surgeons talk to us. At least at my hospital. I'd also imagine that many ladies are older and this is perhaps less important to them as a group, so doesn't get talked about as much. Pah. Sounds like I will have to quiz some medical types and be patient. And also pushy!",

The most common genes are the BRCA genes (these are the ones that Angelina Jolie had and had an elective double mastectomy - I think). There is some info about it here: www.macmillan.org.uk/.../inherited-cancers-breast.html I always assumed it was just a blood test, but don't actually know. Triple negative BC is the most likely type that is linked to these genes. Edited: when my mum had BC she was tested and it wasn't genetic, which means me and my sisters weren't at increased risk (ha!) - if you have sisters/daughters and you/they are positive for the genes, you can get into early screening programmes and the like. ",

He's nothing like I expect a surgeon to be - not nearly as serious as I expect (apparently this doesn't go down well with some patients, he can be quite jokey). Anyway, he said the MRI showed a 'good response' to chemo, but it can't pick up very small clusters of cells or individual cells, the resolution isn't that good - he was very clear to point that out. The lymph nodes have all shrunk too, no sign of anything obvious there. He is still recommending mastectomy because they still need to take out everything that was cancer, to check it over for cells, and better to remove them if they are there (makes sense). Because I had one biopsied positive node, he will take out the sentinel nodes and 4 around them to check, rather than doing a full clearance. If they're clear, then no more node removal. I found that a bit surprising, but good! Radiotherapy still a question mark. I find this a bit weird too, I'd assumed rads were a given. He talked through recon options, pretty much ruled out LD as I don't really have enough and it would probably involve multiple extra filling sessions using fat from elsewhere. DIEP and implant still on the cards, but I am leaning strongly towards implant because of the shorter recovery and shorter op. He's pencilling me in for 10 May for an implant recon, to give me time to chat to a plastic surgeon in case I decide on DIEP. So, some thinking to do over the next week or so!",

This was the main reason for me to go for a DIEP rather than an implant but he seemed quite happy with the idea that if I did need rads it'd be fine.

The nodes option does seem sensible, I'd just assumed that known positive node = clearance as a matter of course, but perhaps things have moved along. I am also slightly puzzled by not needing radiotherapy. Again, I thought everyone had it unless they caught the cancer very early. Everyone certainly seems to have it!

I had another meeting with the surgeon where he explained the node thing a bit more clearly.

As a result, they want to treat me as if I was node negative until any pathology says otherwise. I am still a little bit dubious but willing to wait until I get the path results back from the mastectomy and 4-node sample, and then talking about it some more. I decided to go for the implant reconstruction. Ultimately, the shorter recovery time and smaller operation was what swung it. I just want to get back to normal as soon as I can. Hopefully it will be the right decision although I am sad not to get my free NHS tummy tuck ;-) Surgery will be on Weds, but I am to go in tomorrow for the radioactive dye stuff because the surgeon wants me early on the list on Weds rather than having to wait for nuclear medicine to do their bit first.

I guess the likelihood is that however hard we try we will pick up things like colds, unless we decide to avoid all human contact for the duration, especially at this time of year! I'm just hoping to shake the worst of it before Tuesday!",

I'm really hoping that it doesn't delay things.",

He said that the strattice would support the bottom, and a flap of chest muscle would cover the top - is that what you have? I've been reading about another option where the implant is completely wrapped in the strattice too. It's good to read of others' experiences since I am leaning this way...",

      "Content": "Hi 1BB. I didn't bother with the cold cap, basically because I didn't fancy spending any more time in the chemo unit than was absolutely necessary, but also because I wasn't that bothered about my hair (it'll grow back, in fact it already is) and because the nurses said that if you are having E then they'd seen it not work more times than work. I REALLY didn't fancy it with those odds. Turns out I really like hats! My top tips for chemo (one of the nurses asked me because her cousin is starting soon): 1. Drink lots, especially the day of and two days after 2. Seek help for side effects ASAP. They will give you more/different antisickness meds. They do not want you vomiting. 3. Accept that you will feel awful and go with it. Don't overdo it trying to be normal. After the first cycle you will know more or less what to expect. Keep notes as to what side effects you get each day. Fingers crossed it's easy on you",

I'd say it's worth giving the insurance company a ring and talking it through with someone there? Just say that you are worried you misunderstood the question. ",
