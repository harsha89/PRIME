      "Content": "Hi, i hope someone can give me alittle advice. I had Breast cancer nearly 6 years ago, and that a pull right mastectomy, did the chemo, and then had back flap reconstruction, tried the nipple reconstruction, but sadly it died. its coming up to 4 years now, and finally they are going to give me a nipple.. Anyway, i completed the Tamoxifin in October and my Oncologist suggested i do a 2 year treatment of ZOLADEX. the 1st injection was in my tummy. the 2nd two were put in my lower back ( above my hip) as the nurse said Zoladex was to expensive £250 a shot! so they would give me the cheaper option of GOSERELIN, i didnt question it.. then my last 2 injections have been put into my bottom. i then did question the nurse as i thought it was alittle odd, she got abit snappy with me saying she'd been a nurse for 38 years and she knew what she was doing. she kept saying upper quadrant of the buttox. i have read up on both drugs and they all say the injection needs to be put into the stomach!!!!!!!   Help, i need advice as if anyone else is on this treatment, or what to do.  SHAz. x",

      "Content": "I totally agree Lynn, i dont think i should have been told the cost of the medication, and feel that i should of stayed on the prescribed drug that the oncologist gave me in the first place, but there is nothing i can do.   i need to find my answers before i speak to the nurse which i personally think is administing the drug in the wrong place. i feel very let down at the moment, as iv been through so much. and the added stress really isnt helping.   Thank you anyway. i hope your friend feels better soon. xx",
