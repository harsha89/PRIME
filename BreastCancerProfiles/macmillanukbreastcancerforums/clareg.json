      "Content": "Hi yes it does get better. I too was very big busted so fully understand your thoughts about feeling so lopsided. I too struggled like yourself. My mastectomy was 13 years ago and I too could not have immediate reconstruction. In fact it has taken me 13 years to have reconstruction and my Diep is now this Thursday. (hopefully) I can assure you with time it does get easier. Wishing you all the best. Clare",

      "Content": "Hi, I am new to this site. Hope I have posted this correctly. I now have a date for my DIEP reconstruction- 29th January 2016 at at Salisbury Hospital. I had a mastectomy over 13 years ago when I was 32 and I have worked really hard to lose weight(9 stone) to be considered for surgery. I am naturally anxious and excited about having this surgery and also looking forward to not having to wear my prosthesis. I was wondering from other ladies experiences approximately how long after surgery I would be able to go abroad(fly) as I am thinking about holidays next year. I would appreciate any help or advice.  Kind Regards Clare",

      "Content": "Hi Everyone, I had my DIEP 6 weeks ago now and I have to say I am feeling really quite well. I am 99% healed. My pain has been fine on the whole. I could get about almost straight away. Yes I did feel that I had been knocked down by a bus at the start and the time in recovery in hospital was probably the worst experience for me. I was in a week and everyone including the surgeon said how well I had done, I was so nervous before hand. I have met the surgeon again who has discussed and agreed my next surgery. It is so strange now not to have my prosthesis and great to go shopping and feel whole again and confident in my clothes.  My result is not 100% perfect but with the second surgery it will improve and I am still very very happy. Thanks for all the support!!!! Clare",

My DIEP is now 4-5 weeks away and I am starting to get really nervous again. I have been cancelled before. Has anyone had DIEP recently who would share some experiences with me especially anyone who has had their surgery done at Salisbury. My emotions are all over the place but I am trying really hard to hold in there. I am looking forward to having a new boob after a mastectomy many years ago but anxious of the procedure and recovery.
