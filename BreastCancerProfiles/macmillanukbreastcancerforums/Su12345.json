I had the same dilemma as you I didn't say anything to my family even kept it from my mum .that was until I had to have biopsy then I texted my mum which scared the hell out of her!!! .I have two daughters and a son I didn't want to tell them like u I thought I can protect them from this , but u can't they have a right to know especially my girls ( my mum beat BC twice!! ) so in all fairness they needed to know.  Im the type of person who hates ppl running around for me its me that should be running for them .  Good luck. And accept all the support you need xc",
