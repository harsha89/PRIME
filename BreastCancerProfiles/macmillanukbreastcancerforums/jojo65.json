      "Content": "Hi Sasha and Kay, My partner was diagnosed with tonsil cancer at the begining of the year, (like you Sasha we dont live together due to children but its best for all.) I had fleeting thoughts of withdrawal......and thinking back I think it was due to my life long fears of cancer, having lost my mum to breast cancer when she was in her 30's ( iwas 12) and not wanting my son too see the side effects of treatment, (as I had for my mum) which were nasty for him. AS it was he was soooo brave, wanted time together and time alone, we expalained anything to my son and he was great with it.......my love for him grew more.......and he is now back at work.......he was a true inspiration.... As he got all clear I was diagnosed with breast cancer.....he has been amazing, with me and my sons....there when ever do what ever dont know what id do without him. The ways i supported him were, just being there, ;istening.helping with house work, cooking, love,comfort, phoning chemo unit of his behalf ( he wouldnt trouble people) taking to appointments when he didnt insist on walking or going on bike! visiting in hosp, taking high cal things I thought he may tolerate and taste. He has no family here but good friends who were very good too/ If you dont mind me asking.....was yr partners tumor a lymph node.....thats how they founf my b/fs tonsil cancer xx Jo x  ",
