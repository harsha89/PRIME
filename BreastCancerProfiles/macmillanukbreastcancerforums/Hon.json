    "Content": "Hi Sarah I admire you for what you have written, please talk things through with the medical team and see what they say about your ovaries. it is a very brave thing you are doing but you have obviously thought a great deal about this.   It is like living in a nightmare and you do wonder what else can happen to you but stay positive Sarah because you sound a strong person, I wish you well I was interested to read what another person wrote about how they are going through chemo and how there family has been affected by breast cancer three times now and once with bowel cancer.It is so sad to read but hopefully if this person goes ahead and has the Genetic tests then they will know one way or another, because sometimes the unknown can be worse than the knowing. I would have the Genetic test done especailly if I had sisters, brothers, daughters, sons, because i would want to help them and if that was by having the test to see if I had the Genes then I would not hesitate.  I understand where this person is comingfrom though because it sounds like they are having a rough time with the chemo.  I hope this person is getting lots of support from family, I noticed the person said they had a twin, I was wondering if there is a special bond with a twin compared to another sibling?  thinking of you Sarah and co x Hon                                           Sarah32 I have just found out that I am positive for a mutation in the BRCA1 gene and this is what caused my cancer. I have decided to have a mastectomy of my remaining breast becasue of the 80% chance of having another primary BC in this breast. But I don't know what to do about my ovaries.... There is a 50% chance of me getting ovarian cancer and no screening to monitor this. The only option would be to remove them but I haven't started a family yet and am only 32 so going through surgical menopause has lots of complications. I wondered if anyone else is in the same situation and has any advise to offer becasue I really don't know what to do and am scared. Will this nightmare never end..... Sarah x",
