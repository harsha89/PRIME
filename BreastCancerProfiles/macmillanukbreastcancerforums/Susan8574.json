      "Content": "I have just had left mastectomy and node removal, had it at 5pm on mon, and came home yesterday morning, although do still have a drain , which comes out tonight. A lot of pain when I woke up, meds sorted that, had a comfortable night , as well as you can, but did not sleep all night. Pain now not bad at all, numb under arm and shoulder, I'm getting around the house fine. What was uncomfortable was the compression vest for swelling, I was able to take that off 24hrs after op. I then went back into my crop top. When I was released I was given a temp prosthesis that fits under top, and what a difference that makes to how you look, you can hardley tell, and certainly not with mynjim jams on. Results on tues, and again will be worried as every time we have gone to see dr, it's been worse news, so praying for good news x",
