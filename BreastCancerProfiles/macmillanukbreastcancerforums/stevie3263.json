      "Content": "Hi Chris, thanks for your communication. She had a line going into her chest but it was removed (early I think) due to an infection. This was probably 7 months ago. Again, the chemo treatment never ran the full course as it was taking too much of a toll on her health - ever since she has been suffering the shivers along with intense 'tingling' in her feet.

      "Content": "Hi, my name is Stevie and I've joined in an attempt to help my mother. Having undergone surgery, chemo and radiotherapy she has been left shivering and depressed. Every day maybe for an hour or maybe for 12 she is cold. Blankets and hot water bottles do not help. she is cold inside and its been suggested chemo poisoning is the reason. Can anyone advise on this?? I'm helpless and saddened at her demise and outlook on her life! ",
