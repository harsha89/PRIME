    "Content": "Hello   I have been taking Letrozole for one year I asked my pharmacist to provide me with Accord or Teva any other type gave me worse side effects.  I suffer from joint ache and most of the known side effects.  What I really want to share with you is that I have just returned from a month in India and while I was there I experienced no side effects. ! No joint ache no fatigue.  I felt great.  Not sure whether it was phycological or did the hot weather really help.",
