I am desperately struggling to decide what to do for the best ....... I cant go back to feeling like a zombie again ........... any advice ? anyone else stopped and had a good outcome ? I cant tell my family I have stopped because they will not understand. When I broached the subject initially with my 16 year old she completely flipped and said she would leave home if I stopped the meds.
