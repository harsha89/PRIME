      "Content": "Hi Although I didn't have any lymphoedema post surgery, I have breast lymphoedema post radiotherapy. I have seen breast nurse and consultant and I also feel they don't want to address lymphoedema, except to say year well fitting bra. Advice is to get lymphoedema treated asap for best results but don't know how to do that without referral to lymphoedema clinic. Without treatment it becomes a chronic problem and sadly it will need life long intervention due to damage to lymphatic system.",
