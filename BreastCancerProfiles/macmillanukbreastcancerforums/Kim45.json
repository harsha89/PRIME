      "Content": "Good afternoon I am due to start 6 rounds of chemo next week and had planned on fasting whilst doing chemo (1 day  before, the day of chemo and the day after)  I know a lady who did this and sailed through chemo with no side affects , when your body goes into starvation mode , it apparently protects your good cells Now I have seen information on this that does support this theory. (Only online but we all know how misleading the web can be!) However, when I mentioned this to my Oncologist, she was horrified and advised me not too (please note that I am 2 stone overweight so I have plenty of fat storage)  My thinking is you are not supposed to eat before surgery as mixed with anaesthetic makes you sick? Well the hard chemo and food surely don't mix either?  Anyone fast alongside there chemo ? Or do you think I should listen to my oncologists?? Many thanks xx",

      "Content": "Thanks Caroline  Some American Doctors on You Tube and online , I did have reservations myself but then a friend did it at the beginning of the year (she is stage 3 triple negative) and she really recommends doing it !  A few years back when I was a lot healthier and fitter , I used to fast a least one full day a week and it used to make me feel great but may just eat more healthily like you suggest She has also advised my to stop taking my turmeric and pepper supplements as they are toxic along side chemo , (the things you learn!!!!) The Oncologist says my. Cancers have come back the same DCIS eostrogen positive  and she seemed a little confused when I advised her they were doing further checks  Xx",

      "Content": "Hi ladies Can anyone advise me if being diagnosed with 2 types of breast cancer is normal? They don't want to tell me what types yet as they want to do further tests (I'm sure dcis is one) I've have had left mascetomy with 15 lymph node removal (3 were positive) grade 2 Just waiting to here from Oncology now. Any info is much appreciated as I felt like my doctor yesterday could not get rid of me quick enough (as he said they got it all  during surgery and not to dwell) Many thanks Kim x ",
