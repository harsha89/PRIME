      "Content": "Happy 2015 everybody, just wanted to say a huge thank you to everyone who takes the time to post on this forum, and to all of you with previous experience for sharing and offering much appreciated advice to others, and such a wonderful community, it feels like having an extra family, without the expense ! I have not needed to post much but have followed many of you since my diagnosis in October, and each day I learn more, share a smile or join the 4am club, but a heartfelt thank you to all as it has truly helped me be calm and be prepared for chemo tomorrow. Over the last month I have gone back over the first chemo discussions and assembled a chemo kit !   I have  the mouth treatment kit, manuka honey, ginger nuts, lip and body lotions etc etc etc all thanks to what you ladies have said helped you.   Now let's hope it all brings some comfort and relief.  You all might find me back on a bit more now, asking questions as the chemo kicks in, no cold cap at my hospital so maybe a tale of woe on hair coming up in the next week or two. Thanks everyone on the eve of my chemo I feel calm and relaxed, as the knowledge is beating the fear of the unknown.  Happy New Year, thanks for reading  and a big hug from me to you all  xxxxxx PS   While my tastebuds are working enjoying a New Year glass of wine and popcorn.",

My taste buds are now shot, hate any bread, toast, chocolates, wine and all those left over Christmas goodies taste horrid ! Oh the joys of Chemo, well tea fairy has just brought a cup of black currant and rhubarb tea which is delicious. good luck this weeks chemo girls and Ali Owl on your Picc line today",
