    "Content": "Hello Ladies, I too have rib pain, but on the opposite side to my mx. It came on about 6 months following my last rads. it has been excrutiating at  times, then it seems to improve and then worsens again. I mentioned it to my GP and she said it was nerve pain, possibly as a result of chemo. I am going back to see her again next week as it really does get me down at times. I too have had a clear bone scan and my bc surgeon has evaluated it and seems unconcerned. I would be grateful, if any one finds out what the best thing to do about it is.   Happy New Year ",
