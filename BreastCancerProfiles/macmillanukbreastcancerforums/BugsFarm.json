      "Content": "Smile - so so true! Thank you for reminding me. What I tell my children seems, sometimes, not to  lodge in my brain for me. Let the beauty on the inside come out and dazzle anyone that\u2019s looking then the outside doesn\u2019t matter. Right, off into town today with my clumps to buy scarves with a positive outlook - thanks for your support!",

      "Content": "So my hair has started falling out in little clumps. Does anyone know if this will continue until it\u2019s all gone, or if I\u2019ll wake up tomorrow and need to vacuum my bed? I\u2019m on FEC-T if that has any influence. The children are keen for it not to blow away in the wind while we walk the dog and I\u2019m not keen on doing the food shop if I\u2019m going to shed on the cheese counter. Sorry if I sound flippant, it\u2019s all rather surreal. Any advice will be gratefully received! ",

      "Content": "Ok, thank you - I'll buzz it off when the children go back to school next week (gulp). I actually feel more emotional about the eyebrows and eyelashes than the head hair as you can't disguise those and I can already see the effort of keeping my chin up when people look at me and judge - I refuse to feel like a victim of my circumstances but will have to hone my soft skills in order not to upset the more sensitive peeps in my life...  ",
