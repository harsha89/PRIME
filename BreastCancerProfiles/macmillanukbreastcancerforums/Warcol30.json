      "Content": "Thank you! As I don\u2019t have a lump or symptoms the bc was picked up on the routine mammogram which my consultant is surprised about as it\u2019s measuring 5cm! They have advised me it is also not common that 14 months ago I was tnbc and now the new tumour is ER+! I have had genetic testing and from 15 genes I am negative for all despite having cancer now 3 times! I have taken flax seed previously but know this needs to stop - what other foods should I avoid? I don\u2019t drink tea coffee or have cereal so milk not an issue but I do eat lots of yogurt and cheese!Â  I\u2019m awaiting MRI to confirm size and lymph node involvement and I suspect I will have a CT re my organs! I take MSM which I\u2019ll ask oncologist about and other supplements such as tumeric, fish oil and turkey tail - I\u2019m note sure I will have chemo this time but knowing my onc she will want me to have it I\u2019m more concerned about the side effects of tamoxifen and letrozole etc xxx",
