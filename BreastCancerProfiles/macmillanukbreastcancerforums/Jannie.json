    "Content": "Hi Kitkat, I think it's a great idea - we have been back and forth to hospital, and dread to think about how much we've spent just in the past year in hospital parking charges.  Just the other day we had to pay £12, due to what should have been a couple of hours stretching to 6!! Along with all the clothes in varying sizes due to chemo weight gain/loss, and all the other expenses, it can cost a small fortune, and at 64 I can't even apply for a pension until later this year.  Another cruel fact is that just when you could do with a good holiday, the charges for insurance are astronomical!! Good luck in your treatment xxx Jan",
