    "Content": "Hello.  New to this site, but I wanted to know what everyone was doing about exercise. Haven't been to gym for two months - since my diagnosis.  Have lost two kilos weight but absolutely no volume - muscle to fat! Now during first cycle of 5FEC, I have decided to take my life back again.  Went to gym today to talk to trainer about what I can and can't do.  She had a client with exactly the same cancer and treatment as me last year, so is full of ideas.  She is going to work out a programme for the gym and another that I can do at home for days when I don't feel up to going to gym, so I should be able to do something every day - on top of walking, which we do daily.  The hospital said that I should be able to use swimming pools during the third week of each 3 week cycle because my resistance to infection should have recovered sufficiently by then.   So far I have felt pretty healthy.  Yesterday I was superwoman - I felt fantastic - better than for months, went for long walk , shopped and cooked up a storm!  But today, day 12, I have been completely flattened by fatigue.  I am astonished - I imagined I was going to get through the whole thing with no side effects at all!   Hair - I had it cut at my husband's barbers - number something (1.5cm long).  Feels quite edgy!  Don't fancy a cold cap - I have a lovely wig - completely different from my own hair, also bought collection of turbans and scarves, which I intend to wear anyway, even though hair not started to fall out yet. I am having 3x5FEC followed by 3xTaxotere.  Can anyone tell me what to expect fom Taxotere?",
