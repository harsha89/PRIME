    "Content": "Hi Saxxy, I too had a terrible reaction to 1st dose Taxotere.....Hospital/neutropaenic/ and by the time I went for my next check up, felt that I hadn't recovered from the ordeal. My oncologist said that the itÂ  had a been a severe toxic reaction. I was very frightened to go to my next chemo. I am writing this to reassure you as I had my dose reduced by 20% and my post treatment steroids adjusted and was ok with that, although it did kick my legs from under me for a total of 5 weeks following the intial dose I had. Good luck today Pamx",
