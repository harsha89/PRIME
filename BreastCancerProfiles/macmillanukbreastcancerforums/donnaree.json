      "Content": "Hi everyone, I'm 17 days post my first FEC and my hair is falling out all over the place. I've had it cut short in a pixie type style which I really don't like.  My head is so sore and I'm trying to pluck up the courage to have my head shaved. But it's like the final straw and I'm scared to do it. It's daft really as I hate what I look like now and can't believe that It can make me look any worse. Does anyone know if it will continue to grow still?  Has anyone else shaved theirs off?  I've got my wig and lots of hats and scarves ready! I feel such a wimp, I really thought I was getting along ok until this all started. Sorry if I sound like a moaning minnie. Donna x",

      "Content": "Hi Guys, Had my wig 'thinned out' yesterday at one of the Trevor Sorbie salons. It feels so much better now. I felt my head was twice as big before and it feels more like 'me' now. Having said that still not sure how much I'll wear it , lol!!! I feel so comfortable in my hats.  Can't get on at all with scarves but I even feel happy going comando, something I really thought I'd never do! Worked well on the the chaps coming round trying to sell Sky tv, lol, it's so funny seeing peoples reactions!  The '5 o'clock' shadow I've still got on my head is a bit of a nuisance though. I really have to pull to get some of my hats off, more or less turns them inside out and I have to peel them off, lol! Still got my eyelashes and eyebrows, going to book in for Look good feel better session at the hospital so hopefully they'll have tricks how to deal with that. Next chemo on thursdays, bloods permitting! So hope to have a good few days til then. Take care everyone,  Donna xxx",

      "Content": "Hi Tracy You'll be absolutely fine!  I felt exactly the same as you, I think most of us do/did. But just take it one day at a time, and go with how you feel at the time. I loved my hair too.  My hair was quite long and thick and shiny and I loved it. But just before my chemo started I had it cut to just above shoulder length and I was quite glad I did as when you're having your grotty days after chemo it was much easier to cope with and when I did wash it, it was so much quicker to dry.  When it started to come out I had it cut really short all over, and I must admit if I had to go through it all again I wouldn't have bothered. My hair didn't come out in clumps just a general shredding all over and most people didn't even notice! It wasn't until it got really thin and was coming out quite a lot that I suddenly decided one day, right this is it and I had my friend who's also my hairdresser shave it off for me. I had a good cry while she was doing it (she did too, lol) But I felt so much better afterwards! I'b bought lots of hats (I'm not into scarves) and I've got my wig.  To be quite honest I'm quite happy at home not to wear  anything and i'm even tempted to go out without anything on as well! So, totally the opposite of what I'd thought I'd be like. So don't be scared, nothing that bad is going to happen, it's only a blip and will grow back, it's not for ever. My friend went through all this a couple of years ago. She had fab hair before and it's come back exactly the same. Allow yourself to have wobbles, we all do!  Take a deep breath and worry about it when it happens. I think you'll suprise yourself just how strong you are. Always here if you need a chat, take care.  Donna xxx",

They are 'Stretch Crochet Headbands' which can go around the brim of a hat. Pick 'UK only' , although there are chinese and hong kong options as well. Some come with flowers which are detachable. They're really cheap and come in lots of different colours. I was in danger of buying in hat in every colour to match all my clothes, this is much cheaper! I bought a white hat and just change the head band to match! Take care,  Donna xx",

Can't believe how good I feel now, I didn't realise how much it had been dragging me down. Everywhere I went I left a trail of hair!  I must admit it does feel a bit strange but I got up this morning put on some dangly earing and some lippy and eye shadow and voila! I feel better already. Thankyou so much everyone.  If it hadn't been for all your encouragement I don't think I would have taken the final step. I feel like me again!  For anyone in the same position, don't be afraid. It's a really scarry thing to have happen but you wil be ok. We're special people and can get through anything that's thrown at us! Love to everyone,  Donna",
