      "Content": "I have just finished 20 sessions, 15 for the whole right breast and 5 on the area where the lump was. I used a cream called My Trusty that was developed by Salisbury Hospital (skin specialist), it contains all natural ingredients and a bonus for me that it's not tested on animals. Yes I did get sore a little which only lasted a few days but touch wood my skin is in good condition, apply twice a day.",

      "Content": "I was diagnosed with breast cancer her2 positive on 24 July and started chemo on 6 August, I had kept myself busy up to then. It's been a week since first session, however feels longer. Ive been very lucky that I have never been really ill and always strong , but this chemo I feel is wrecking me and my personality.  How do you keep moving forward, I have another 5 sessions every 3 weeks. ",
