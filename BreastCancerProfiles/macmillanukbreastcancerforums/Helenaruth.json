      "Content": "Thank you for sharing. I'm having hopefully my first injection to expand tomorrow if my infection has cleared up enough. I will be asking questions as it seems that some people only have the implant whereas I seem to think I'm having this then it taken out and replaced. I didn't ask many question when I got my results as was in shock. So I'm making notes now. But atleast all your comments have made me feel more relaxed. Thank you xx",
