    "Content": "Hello new to this site and getting worried ! i was diagnosed with secondary internal mammary node last year and was in such a lot of pain with it my oncologist decided to radiate  I had 10 sessions over 2weeks which did take the pain away I have ct scan every 3months but for the past 3 months the pain has returned I have had another ct scan to see why but she says it hasn\u2019t grown and is stable and can\u2019t give me an answer as to why I\u2019m getting pain again  has anybody had a similar experience and what should I be asking when I next see her ?  I was told if it gets worse to get in touch with the team I\u2019m under I\u2019m controlling it myself with pain killers but it\u2019s on my mind all the time thinking it\u2019s growing  any feed back would be appreciated  Trish65",
