    "Content": "I'm at the stage were I have had enough. I can't continue with the upset, especially of my family. I'm pushing them away but don't know why. I want to protect them by not putting them through this.  I can't cope with the cancer and the package that comes with it. I can't lie as I was a proud man. And now I'm embarrassed and feel ridiculed. ",
