      "Content": "Hi everyoneÂ  After having a mammoplasty and reconstruction , then a re-excision to remove 3 x stage 2b tumors, I have been told on Friday \"it's all gone\" and just need radio and tamoxifen. After such relief initially, why oh why do I feel so very low and lost, and unable to understand my current low mood? Has anyone experienced anything similar, at a time that should be so joyful? Love to all of you going through your tough journey xx",
