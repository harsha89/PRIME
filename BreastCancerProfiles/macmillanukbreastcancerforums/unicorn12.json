      "Content": "Hi  I was at oncologist yesterday and i start chemo in 2 weeks. FECT 6 cycles 3 weeks apart. I think it is becoming real now and Iam so scared. Please tell me this isn't as bad as I am imagining and i will get through this.  I will have herceptin as well. Worried sick. Just when I seem to settle down I then start worrying again.  We go on holiday Saturday as managed to bring this forward. Don't want to ruin the holiday for everyone by worrying all the time.  Thanks.",

I need to try and out worries in a box and only allow them out once a day as weeblemum said. Worrying as you say won't change a thing it just makes the situation worse.  Thank you ",

I was going to get those travel bands and ginger biscuits. I heard eating pineapple is good for side effects as well but not sure if that's true.  I need to just try and forget about it till nearer the time.  Good luck I will keep in touch  X",
