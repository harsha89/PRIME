      "Content": "Sorry for butting in here, but Grogg, I have believed for some years that pharmaceutical companies  do just what you say they do When natural therapies are found to work...a drug company has been known to buy the rights to the substance, alter it a bit and market it under a patent so as to make money.  Sadly, the small change can make a big difference to the efficacy  of the substance. Please dont stop your current treatment tho, you need to go and ask your doctor, if anything appears relevant. J",

      "Content": "Corrianne, you are quite correct, I believe.  For instance, I learned recently that each cancer cell has around 29 sugar receptors. It is true thst cancer needs sugar to grow, sadly the body needs some..and will convert carb to sugar. But we should avoid eating high sugar foods....I love chinese food, but msg is also bad for us as it passes the blood/ brain barrier and is what is known as an 'excitotoxin' And not ideal for us. The body is healthier when in an alkalinic state. J",
