      "Content": "Thanks Karen, it is good to know that it isn't just me! Can I ask what problems you had with Tamoxifen please? I'm getting dreadful hot flushes but seem to be controlling them with daily sage tablets.They're unpleasant now rather than unbearable. I'm not sure if the depression was linked to it but at least that's under control with meds. I seem to be living on pills these days. I do hope you feel better soon. Its a tough road isn't it. Best wishes to you, love Kate",

      "Content": " Hi everyone. Its been a long while since I've been on here but I need some advice please. I had surgery  December 2013 . Lumpectomy, complete lymph clearance and a reduction to both breasts. My last FEC/T was May 2013 and radio, end of July 2013. I'm taking Tamoxifen for 5 years. I was given a mild antidepressant Sept 2014 which I am still on. I had a mammogram this Christmas which thankfully showed nothing abnormal. My problem is that I still have breast pain from the lumpectomy / lymph node removal. I find that I'm so tender that even wearing a soft bra is painful, an under wired bra is impossible. My hands are usually numb when I wake up and even after all this time I don't feel fit enough to return to work . I'm walking a few miles everyday to try and build up stamina but I get home exhausted and seem to have constant joint pain. Has anyone else had this experience? I know that being thrown head first into the menopause hasn't helped but its been 8 months since the end of treatment. Why don't I feel normal? I really want to find work and support myself again but I don't know what I can do when I'm feeling so \" not well , worn out, knackered \" ! I know I should be happy that my cancer has been treated and I am, but how can I move forward when every day still feels like a battle? I'm sorry to whine, I suppose I need to know if this is \"normal\". Should I just grin and bare it? Kate.",

      "Content": "Judith, thank you for replying. It seems like you've had a really bad time. I must admit that I'm not really vigilant about my at risk arm, after reading your message I will certainly take more care. I was on a waiting list for counselling but once the antidepressants kicked in and I didn't feel so disappointed at waking up in the mornings, I figured that someone else should have my spot. Oh do get some Siamese, I don't think I could manage with out my cat. They just know when you need a hug . Toby is a tabby who was delivered to me by a neighbour at 6 weeks old. I had been looking to re home a siamese before he arrived . He's going to be 10 this year and is my constant companion. If ever you want someone to chat with I'd be happy to Judith, it must be difficult living alone.  Take care, love Kate ",

      "Content": "Hi Emma, I've just read your reply to Julie . Its so good to hear that your side effects have mostly gone. I shall keep going and hope mine do too. Ive been taking them for 7 weeks so far. My gp prescribed Dixarit to help with the horrendous amount of  hot flushes, I've stuck with them for 3 weeks and they do work . Having said that , I've decided to put up with the flushes and night sweats for now. The side effects from the Dixarit were far worse, feeling constantly dizzy and like I would pass out at anytime.  Julie. It is worth speaking to your gp before you stop the Tamoxifen, there are other things that you can get to help. Sage is supposed to be very helpful.  Don't give up! ",
