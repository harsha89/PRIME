    "Content": "Hi all, I, like so many of you, was shocked to be diagnosed with DCIS just over a week ago. I had a really painful left breast and went to the GP, mammogram and biopsy at breast clinic a few weeks later and I'm told I have to have a mastectomy. On Monday I had a biopsy on my lymph nodes as they look abnormal so if it has spread I'll need chemotherapy too - before they operate apparently. I'm generally fairly positive in outlook and have remained so so far, although if I think about the whole taking my boob off thing I get quite emotional. I'll definitely need some advice from all those who have had reconstruction, really unsure and confused about it. First bridge to cross is this wednesday though when I get my lymph nodes results, keep your fingers crossed for a clear result, thanks.",
