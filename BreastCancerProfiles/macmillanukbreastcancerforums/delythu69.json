      "Content": "[quote user=\"Judyr58\"Good evening everyone I have seen two Macmillan TV adverts this evening, as well as lots of adverts on their Facebook site - and this website - for Brave the Shave, This is encouraging people to raise money for people affected by cancer by shaving their head - it has fostered a climate where people think it is showing support to people who have lost their hair by doing this too. Even my own daughters offered to shave their heads when they knew I was to have chemo and lose my hair - talk about brainwashing! I can't think of anything that would have made me more upset than to see them lose their hair too. I have pretty much powered my way through 8 cycles of DC and had every side effect it could throw at me, one stay of a week in hospital, and four times they called me in because of various things, two bad reactions in the chair - but the one thing that reduced me to tears wasn't being told I had cancer, it was being told I would lose all my hair in the second week of the first cycle. And I don't need to tell any of you how hateful I found having huge handfuls come out in the shower (and I had short hair so hadn't thought it would be so horrid). And then your eyebrows and eyelashes go - and your femininity feels like it's being stripped away bit by bit. Frankly I find people who say they will get their head shaved as support, and that say they do it to \"share\" our experience haven't a clue! They might choose this, we haven't chosen it - and wouldn't. It may sound over the top to some of you, but I find this whole campaign offensive, insensitive and patronising - particularly seeing people smile while having their head shaved, and people cheering. I didn't smile, and my daughter and husband didn't feel like cheering when they shaved my head. Ok I'm cool with my look now - the very shiny head (not a short razor clipped look) - but I would prefer not to have had to experience any of this. If you agree - please let me know. I have messaged Macmillan previously and never even had a response. I've commented on Facebook under their posts in the past urging people to find fun ways to raise money (and there are so many) and not to do this for me.........and there is always a huge response in terms of \"likes\" and comments from people in our reluctant community. If people are with me - maybe we can convince Macmillan to stop this barbaric approach to fund raising. Either like this post or put a comment of support please - if you don't agree, that's fine, no need to do anything! Well - that's my rant over - you might have noticed I feel a tad passionate about this! []] I totally agree with all you have said. I feel sick to the bottom of my stomach when people say they are having their head shaved to help raise funds for cancer charities! There must be nicer, better ways to raise money. I feel patronised that someone would think they are sharing my experience by shaving their heads - as though that experience was all there was to it & the day after my head was shaved it started growing back (not!!!!) thank you for posting your feelings - I felt guilty I was being mean when all people want to do is help. Just help in a different way - that's great! ",
