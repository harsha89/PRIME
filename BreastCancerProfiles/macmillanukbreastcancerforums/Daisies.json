      "Content": "I had breast cancer about 5 years ago. It was Her2+, ER+, PR+. I am currently taking Letrezole, Calcium + Vitamin D, and high blood pressure medication. I notice for nearly 2 years now, I have been having series of anxieties. I have had some series that lasted for a few months. It arises again in the past week and I don't like the feeling at all.   I notice the below syndroms when the anxieties visits : - I fear the worst of things. - I worry alot. - I overthink things to the very maximum (especially all the worst thoughts) * how I wish I could overthinking of the best of things that can go right - maybe I should try that tonight. - I feel the need to protect myself in all situations (especially in the decisions that I make). - I feel loss and empty.  - I lack of confidence in the decisions I would like to make. - I wake up very early, noticing that I have to control my breathing (to breathe deeply in, and then out). - I can be tearful sometimes.   As the anxieties comes and go, the first and last time I saw my GP about it, I was feeling very well in myself. I told my GP I would think about therapy. I have not done anything about it until last week where the anxiety comes back again when I received news about some things that worries me. I have made the decision to see my GP again and have made appointment to see her. I feel it isn't normal to feel so anxious when I receive whatever news I received, and it lasted for nearly a week now.   My questions are : 1) As the cancer I had was hormonal (Her2+, ER+, PR+), what type of anxiety medications would suit me ? I know this may not be the meds that my GP will suggest, but knowing the meds that will suit and be safe for me will be helpful. I would also prefer medications that are temporary, and not long term.   2) I bought Kalm and when I researched on it and comparing the ingredients with informations on the Memorial Sloan Kettering website, I find the ingredients used are not suitable for those with history of hormonal cancer. Please could you advice thoughts on this ?   Would appreciate hearing from anyone at all with regards to the aboves. Thank you.",

      "Content": "Hi, just checking through if you had tamoxifen before the oophorectomy, along with Zalodex ? if yes, did you change medication immediately after the oophorectomy or there is a transition gap before that ? Or is there a need to change medication as all ? Checking through on this as I will be going through with oophorectomy in a few days and this matter did not come to mind until yesterday !!",
