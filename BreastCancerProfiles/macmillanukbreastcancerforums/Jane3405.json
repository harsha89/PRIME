      "Content": "Hi. Recovering from stage 2 IDC breast cancer. All good. Op last May followed by 5 weeks of radiotherapy and on letrozole for 5 years.  Clear lymph nodes. However have been suffering from chronic diarhhea since the beginning of January. Have been to my GP and spoke to my oncologist and came off the letrozole for 3 weeks. No change to my embarrassing problem an have been referred today to go to the bowel cancer department of my local hospital in 2 weeks. Clutching at straws I suppose my question is has anyone else suffered from chronic diarhhea after being on letrozole for over 8 months? Xx",
