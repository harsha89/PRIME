      "Content": "HI just has worst 3 weeks ever, 2nd mammogram, biopsy and results!!   my elderly mum was told last Monday she has grade 2 breast cancer, my world fell apart and hers off course. they reassured us it was good find! due to early screening and treatable. got to see the surgeon tonight and very scared. she will have to have surgery and am so worried about the future now, she is 82. I'm nervous, scared, not hardly eaten for a week, and worried about the journey she needs to go through.  is this normal to feel like this,? trying to be positive but its the word cancer that so scary. has anyone recovered now and living a normal life??",

      "Content": "Hi thank you for your reply n No it's my mum but I'm feeling everything for her, went to see doctor last night. She needs a mactecmony but no chemo or radiation at the moment. She will have a reconstruction. Funny enough I feel relived that hopefully an operation will now resolve it.  Yes I agree it's the word cancer that freaked me out. Thank you so much for the support x",

      "Content": "Hello.  Thank you for your reply. I'm so sorry you both have cancer. Yes I'm guilty of seeing the situations through my eyes and not Mums.  She too needs a mastectomy and a reconstruction, but thankfully no chemo.  I agree taking on here helps, I felt very lonely been thrown into something that's changes the family's life in an instance.   I wish you well and hope both yours and your mums treatment goes well.  The hospital do a fantastic job.  Keep positive.
