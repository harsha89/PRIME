    "Content": "I had have had an implant for nine years for asymetrical development (i only grew 1 in the first place). Although the circumstances are different I know that sometimes the surrounding tissue can form a capsual around the implant, a natural defence mechanism, but this can cause hardness and distortion. Our breast care nurses here are always willing to have a quick look if im worried about anything so it might be worth having a little chat with the breast care team. Hope this helps x",
