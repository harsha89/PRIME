      "Content": "Hi I don't log on very regularly, so excuse the late reply.  I started taking tamoxifen 1 month ago and I was so worried about how it would effect me. But fingers crossed, it hasn't been too bad. I was worried about putting weight on but I joined Slimmers World in Jan and I've managed to lose 1 stone 4 lbs so far and it doesn't seem to have slowed it down. I do get the occasional hot flush and fine that my legs sweat at night which is a bit strange but I just throw the covers off til I cool down. I hope you don't find it too bad. Px    ",

      "Content": "Hi I've been on Tamoxifen for 6 months now.  I was so worried at the beginning when I first started taking it.  I was paranoid about weight gain, which in the grand scheme of things, seems pretty stupid! But I'm glad to say, that I joined Slimming World and have lost 2 stone while taking Tamoxifen. I noticed the odd hot flush at the beginning, but this seems to have eased off. I just had my first 6 month review of Tamoxifen and I'm staying on it for now.      ",
