      "Content": "You can come off anytime you like. The other thing I found really helpful is you have a research nurse allocated to you. Mine is a total legend and has really helped with me moving on from it all. They do phone consults after the first 6 months so you don\u2019t have to go to the hospital all the time. ",

      "Content": "I\u2019m on this trial and the drug is fine and it\u2019s not like chemotherapy and I\u2019m managing to work full-time. The follow up is very reassuring and I wouldn\u2019t let the side -effects put you off. Clinical trials are not everyone\u2019s cup of tea so nobody should feel guilty but don\u2019t let the side effect profile put you off here -it\u2019s been fine and lots have been signing up from my neck of the woods as it\u2019s one of the more tolerated CDK inhibitors. ",
