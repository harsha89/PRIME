    "Content": "Hi Claire My story is almost the same as yours.  I was given the all clear after a biopsy only to then find out it was bc. This was in september. Still feel numb with the shock. Mine is only grade one and hasnt spread to my lymph nodes although there is cellular change in the rest of my breast which i am terrified it will come back!! Have had a lumpectomy and am also on hormone treatment for five years and am due to start my radiotherapy jan 3. i havent been offered chemotherapy dont know whether thats because mine is grade one. Have been told i may want to consider a double mastectomy in the future!! Like you don't know which is the best route to take. Lots of love  ",
