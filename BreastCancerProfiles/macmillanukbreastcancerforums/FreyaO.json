      "Content": "Hello, Hope you all are doing well and coping well with your treatments or life after treatments :)  I was diagnosed with BC almost 2 years ago and had lumpectomy, chemo and radio and completed my treatments in July 17. This year I've been dealing with a pain on my left lower leg since February and after a long diagnosis process, thankfully it is confirmed that it is not secondaries but a stress fracture.  I've been referred to have PEMF (Pulse Electromagnetic Fields) therapy which seems to be the only healing option. However at the beginning of the therapy I was given a consent form asking if I have any cancer as the therapy may cause existing tumors to grow!!!  According to the physiotherapist and orthopedic surgeon that this risk wouldn't apply to me as I am in remission and technically don't have cancer anymore but of course this got me worried.  I contacted my BCN and MacMillan help line but no concrete answer yet. MacMillan suggested that I contact my BCN. My BCN will ask my oncologist about this but she has not come back to me yet.  When I looked up on the internet I found conflicting information as well; there were lots of articles suggesting that PEMF may cure cancer but this is not clinically proven yet and no articles about causing tumors to grow!???   Apologies for a long background on this but I will appreciate your thought if any of you had any experience or came across with this therapy. I've been through several anxious months because of this pain and I was very hopeful for a resolution/cure and didn't expect this curve ball :(  Any views/thoughts will be greatly appreciated.  Many thanks Freya",

      "Content": "Thanks for the reply Carolyn, You have summarised my thoughts! After having gone through chemo to minimise the risk, taking new risks doesn\u2019t feel right but I am desperate for a treatment at the same time. Unfortunately resting my lleg is not a realistic option with a full time job and a young kid even with a helpful husband. This has been going on for 8 months now   thank you for the hugs, much appreciated Freya",

      "Content": "Thank you both, I will try the links to experts, though this might be th same group of experts that my phone call was directed to. No harm in trying.  The form only asks for the patient to declare if they active cancer or not. To be honest it feels like a typical \u201cif there isn\u2019t enough evidence either way then let\u2019s cover ourselves\u201d sort of approach. There is no explanation of the risk and the information out there is conflicting  I am at the verge of saying it can\u2019t be worse then getting an X-ray but will try to be patient and see what the oncologist and the expert will say. Thanks again Freya xx",
