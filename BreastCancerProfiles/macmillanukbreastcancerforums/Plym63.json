      "Content": "Hi I am new here and finding my way about. I was diagnosed with stage 3 breast cancer in October. Have had lumpectomy and lymph node clearance. Unable to have FEC as I have a heart condition. Started first treatment of taxol on Monday will have a further 11 weekly treatments with herceptin.  First treatment went well but since yesterday I have had really bad pains in my legs, I am in agony and haven't slept, I have been taking co-codamol but it's not helping that much. Does anyone know if this continues throughout the treatment and will I get this constantly. It's really bad, I know I just have to put up with side effects but if it gets worse I am not sure I will cope. Sorry if I sound self absorbed but not sure what to do.  ",
