      "Content": "As I have stated before,I am taking Arimidex which is much more likely to produce osteoporosis in the long term.. My onc sent me for a bone density scan and compared it with one I had a few years earlier.There was no difference. So far so good. Calcium supplements are not recommended generally and are usually only required when diet  Calcium intake is insufficient. So lots of milk and yogurts!.There is of course the danger of taking too much and ending up with hypercalcaemia.The dose of Calcium required in osteoporosis is high and should be taken under the instructions of a doctor. Bisphosphonates which I think Tess was meaning are prescription only. Don't worry,you'll soon be told if you need to take anything extra. At the moment I find it hard to remember to take one Arimidex daily as have been quite lucky not no have to take anything since way back in my Pill days!!! All the best. be guided by the experts.xx",

      "Content": "Hi. This is just a personal opinion but in the past I have read the pros and cons for soya to name but one product where there is conflicting information. Phytoestogens are said to protect against or encourage cancer depending on which paper you read and I mean scientific paper not The Sun! I have reached the conclusion that everything in moderation is the answer, otherwise I think I'd go mad!! As far as dairy products are concerned I take milk on my cereal,in my coffee and usually have a yogurt daily. I use fromage frais quite a lot in cooking but as you can see I'don't go mad on the dairy. My philosophy is a little of what you fancy etc etc. I have read my post again and think I may have mislead you as I meant to say that the hypercalcaemia referred to taking calcium supplements without supervision. If you are worried ask if you can have a bone scan. It could set your mind at rest. All the best in this \"journey\" which none of us wishes to take.xxx    ",

      "Content": "I finished radiotherapy about a year ago and recently got the all-clear from the hospital so I should be happy but I'm not. The reason is I have to take Arimidex for the next four years and I am suffering from arthralgia(joint pain) because of this. It is a side effect of the drug which affects about 10% of people taking it so I guess I am just unlucky. It is not an unbearable pain but is an ache which does get me down, especially in the evening. When I sit down I just stiffen up! Now I realise this is a minor thing compared with what many of you have had to put up with and there is not a lot I can do apart from taking pain killers but I thought I would just have a moan!!! I don't want to change to another drug and I don't want to take stronger pain killers so I'm stuck with it. Anyone else in the same boat?",

      "Content": "Loxifan is available as Femara in Britain. Aching limbs (arthralgia) is an unfortunate side effect of all drugs which act in this way. Others are Arimidex and Aromasin.It occurs in about 10% of users. If pain too bad you could ask for an alternative but this may still give you the pains. If you can't cope then pain killers are very effective but then these may have to be taken for the duration of taking the original drug.It's your choice.",

      "Content": "Hello Fiona, Wishing you good luck for tomorrow.  Your glass is definitely half full.....you are here talking about it. Chemo, is not the best experience but it is a positive one, just remember that.    Much as you may  not wish to eat , do try as it is really important to keep the blood good.  (My chemo was in Spain and they always insisted we eat before a session and drink water to rid some of the toxins) Yeah! who cares about a wig?  Go natural.   Be proud.    You are surviving. Good to hear you have friends that are joining in the 'fun'.  They know what to expect, and be with you all the way.   Those that avoid you (my experience) are not really your friends and best avoided in return.   You will feel tired, so just nod when you want to.  Plenty of time later on to be polite and socialize, people just have to go with your treatment. Lots of good wishes and luck for the future. Mary",
