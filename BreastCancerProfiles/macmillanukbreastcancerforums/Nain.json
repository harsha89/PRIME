Its pointless telling you not to worry shawahank.... cos it only natural..... but do try sweetie....LOL! huge hugs always Nain xxx",

After speaking to the oncologist about my concerns we identified the main factor was the steriods I had to take the day before, day of, day after. I found  that ginger beer was helpful with the thick and sore tongue, before the treatment I hated the taste of ginger beer, now its a life line LOL!doc Wishing you well with your treatment.

I know its hard when there is a 2year to look after..... . Buts shes not just your resposibilty..... thats why we have friends and family.  We all look after each other in times of need. I have HER2 Positive, 27mm grade 3, hopefully I will start chemo next week, 3 FEC, 3 DOC and 15 sessions of rads. The last few days have been bad, so today my eyes see the mess of the house.... but to hell with it I come first at the moment. ( and I never thought i would ever say that LOL! ) I looked after my mum full time last year as she went through cancer, the chemo wiped her out and she felt low which was not her usually happy self. She rested alot, on the good days we went for short walks, she did a little round the house.other days she rested.  Just for today....  is my motto !! Everyone is different, please look after your self, I know is easier to say than do , be a little selfness sometimes. All the work will be there ! if other people are worried they can just do it :P Tomorrow is another day, lets hope its a better day for you. Take Care.... Huge Hugs Jean x",

I had a lumpectomy and one node removed a couple of months ago, and last week a second op to take some more tissue to make the margins bigger. I get the results tomorrow, either its Plan A or Plan B. Like the other ladies say mention it to your onc, to talk through your worries. If they were worried at all, they would have sent you for a bone scan, mine came back all clear, so I know the chest pains and the aching upper arm and back pain are just side effects. My BCN, did say the pains maybe a result of things settling down from the operations. There is always some worry with any aches or pains, as we are on high alert these days ! theres no harm in asking again Sue. Take Care and all the best for tomorrow. Huge Hugs Nain xx",
