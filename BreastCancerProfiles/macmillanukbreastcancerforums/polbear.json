      "Content": "Hello to you all, hope you're day has been ok.  I had my last Docetaxel session 2 weeks ago (yay) but still feel bloated, as if my stomach is pushing into my ribs.  It's really uncomfortable and I'd hoped it would have subsided by now.  Did anyone else feel bloated after Docetaxel - not sure if it's a common side effect - and how long do the side effects last after the last session.  My feet are really painful and I still feel tired (although I do have Fibromyalgia too)!  Thank you for any welcome advice.",

      "Content": "Hello bonbonlarue Thanks for the reply :-) Sounds like you've done well so far with the Docetaxel.  I think I've got away lightly compared to some I've seen on here, although I had 3 visits to hospital during my 3 rounds.  Yes, keep moisturising, as the skin on my hands peeled after 2 round, now on my feet after 3rd round.  It doesn't hurt though, just gets dry and flakes off :-( my finger & toe nails got tender too.  Luckily I didn't have diarrhoea as I was warned it's quite common, but I do take Co-codamol which has the opposite effect! Good luck with the rest of your Docetaxel.  Go with what your body tells you.  Drink lots of water and rest as much as you need to. Take care Polly x",

      "Content": "Hi Shaz Thanks for replying :-) Yes, it's a relief to get it done.  It definitely is 'The Evil One!' Sorry to hear you feel bloated...it's really horrible - glad to know I'm not the only one though...you never know what's 'normal'.  I have Tramadol, Gabapentin & Co-codamol, as I have fibromyalgia too, so sore muscles & peripheral nerve pain on a regular basis, without the side effects of Docetaxol too...grrr!  Can't wait for the bloating to disappear, though it hasn't put me off food, just makes it worse after I've eaten! Good luck with your next two sessions, hope your side effects are minimal.  Drink lots of water and go with what your body tells you :-) Take care Polly x",

      "Content": "Hello weemaw Thanks for the reply :-) Yes I had FEC before Docetaxel and it was a breeze by comparison!  I'm sure the amount of pills we have to take can't help with stomach problems, although I have Lanzoprazole and Domperidone along with lots of painkillers.  I did my own research about supplements to take, as the oncologist and doctors think they're all a load of hocus-pocus!  I take Echinacea, Vitamin E & Acetyl L Carnitate, and my iron & neutrophil count were always good (I didn't tell them I was taking supplements, as they didn't agree with it!) The tiredness is hard to bear, as I usually have lots of nervous energy and always on the go.  I have the burning/fizzing feet and hands, but take Gabapentin, which helps a bit.  Really hated losing my sense of taste, as I love my food.  Enjoying eating curry and gherkins though! Good luck with the rest of your treatment :-) Take care Polly x",

      "Content": "Hi jmwatson Thank you for your reply.  The bloating is horrible and was made worse by the steroids, but I finished them a fortnight ago and had hoped it would have subsided by now, but still there :-( Tiredness is really hard work, as my head wants to do so much but my body won't let me!  Yes, my legs feel very weak too - very frustrating...grrr! Sorry you had these awful side effects too, but good to know they're 'normal' for Docetaxel and will eventually go away.  The FEC was easy compared to Docetaxel - didn't know what had hit me after the first session! Hope your bloating will soon be a distant memory.  Good luck with any further treatment. Take care Polly x",
