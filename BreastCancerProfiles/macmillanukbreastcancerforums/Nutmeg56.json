On rare occasions patients might get a temperature when you will need a bit of looking after. I live on my own and only had a friend or family member with me a couple of times cos they were free. You can do this Restory. Use now and the good weeks in between doses to get organised with a haircut, shopping, freezing some food and doing the washing/ironing for your daughter. Do not worry about housework!!! It is a horrible time but it will be over  before you know it.",

Once you know what you are dealing with I think you will probably stop worrying and trying to keep everything \"normal\". The chemo is bearable but after 3 ECs I know I feel wretched for the first 5 days. I can do stuff but only if absolutely necessary!!  I would make the most of the next 3 days to get everything done for Christmas then you can rest for a few days before enjoying the big day. My friends set up a Whatsapp group for me so I can share news and ask for help. Take everything on offer - nobody minds. I have learned that everybody knows how rough it is and will think you are amazing for going through it. Thinking of you as you start your treatmen Ann :-)",

He is very knowledgeable but if I wasnt used to him I am sure that I would be very reluctant to proceed! I was concerned when he told me that if it was known before surgery that I would need RT ( all my lymph nodes were removed as most were cancerous) I wouldnt have had an immediate DIEP reconstruction. He said that there is a chance that my foob could fail as the blood supply will become too constricted. Interested in hearing from anyone who has had RT after reconstruction and the effects on the new boob. I am going to the Genesis Centre in Windsor and start in a couple of weeks so will be in the May group. Anyone been treated there?",

What I cannot go on are the rides that take you from a standing start to 80 mph a in a couple of seconds and that is what it has felt like. The weeks of testing then diagnosis then surgery take your breath away. I think when medical teams decide that an MX secures your survival it is enough for a patient to process and best case scenario is that you will just need tablets afterwards. During surgery your lymph nodes will be checked and removed if cancerous. That is the unknown. My surgeon had to deliver the bad news that he had had to remove all my nodes and most of them were cancerous. I do not have breast cancer anymore but to reduce the odds of getting secondaries I am having chemo and RT.  I am sure that this is why your team are saying that it is a possibility. But it is worse case scenario and although it was horrible news I have accepted my treatment is going to last a bit longer. There is nothing that you can do to change what they will find during your MX so enjoy your pre op days and deal with the next challenge when it comes. Good luck.",

Your symptoms certainly sound similar to mine and I thnk that you need to see a psychotherapist. I doubt you will get a referral on NHS quickly so if you have some pennies available I think it is a good imvestment. The important thing is to talk and then talk some more. My therapist got me to write everything down in detail and then highlight all the negative thoughts. We then talked about those and came up with \"scripts\" of rational thinking that I can use whenever I have those thoughts. She also taught me to accept that a terrible thing has happened to me and all the bad thoughts and feelings are perfectly normal. I am not going mad!!!! I would also make the most of the times when you do not feel too bad. Have a shower, dress, put some make up on and meet friends/do something you love. I have just been to the hairdressers for a wash and blow dry. Please know that this is a temporary thing and you will get better. Keep posting.",

The tummy wound was the most painful and it was a few days before I could stand up straight. I had a catheter in for 4 days which saved a lot of hassle.  Because of the amazing way that the surgeons work from inside my body, my abdomen felt very strange - like a hot water bottle! I had lots of nodes removed so under my arm was very sore as sensation returned - like really bad sunburn. I was in hospital for a week and the car journey home was tough, especially over bumps. Within 4 weeks my wounds were healed and I started applying bio oil. I was able to drive after 5 weeks and I am now home alone. My armpit is still numb and the sensation is slowly returning under my arm. My foob is swollen and sore. I will start chemo in a few weeks followed by radiotherapy. After that I will have surgery reduction of my other breast. I am off to get my hair cut short on Thursday. I am not going to bother with the cold cap or have a fake nipple. Good luck with your surgery and the follow up scans. I plan to post my chemo story and hope you will have good news for us after your surgery.",

I am still numb in my armpit (but I had all my lymph nodes removed) and there is a small scar from where my nipple was to under my arm. Knowing how it was I would still make the same choice.

      "Content": "This poem was on a Facebook group. I found it really helpful as I can never find the words to explain how I feel. It's a bit long so hope the system can cope! They said to go home. They said the scans look fine, your body will recover, you don\u2019t need to be here anymore. They said to go home. They said, \u201cwe don\u2019t know if it will come back, but it very well might. Until then there\u2019s not much we can do.\u201d They said, \u201cgo on and live your life.\u201d Take a breath, take a nap, maybe even take a vacation. Go back to your jobs, back to your hobbies, back to laundry, dishes, and paying the bills. Spend time with your family, meet a friend for lunch, catch a movie with your loved ones. Take a day to do absolutely nothing. It sounded nice when they said to go home. So we went home. But the home we went back to wasn\u2019t as familiar as we thought. The paint was the same color and the furniture was in place, but it didn\u2019t feel like the same home. Our thoughts, feelings, and interests had all changed. Our relationships, jobs, and bodies felt so much different. They said to go home, so we tried to go home, but it didn\u2019t feel like home. We felt lost. It was as if we had been on a path, kidnapped somewhere in the middle, turned around 20 times, and set off in a new direction. We didn\u2019t know which way was up or down, left or right. We were in a new place, stranded in the desert- abandoned, desolate and lonely. They said to go home. But home was out of reach. The home we knew didn\u2019t exist anymore. We wandered around for awhile before trying to build a new home. But the new home crumbled and cracked, forcing us to repair, rebuild, or start completely over. They said to go home. But they didn\u2019t understand. After seeing thousands of patients in this position, they still didn\u2019t understand. It looked so simple from their perspective. Go home, go back to your life, pretend that cancer never came. But we couldn\u2019t go home. Our souls were altered on the deepest level. Our hearts were shattered, our minds were chaos, and our bodies hurt. They couldn\u2019t see it. But then we saw others. \u201cDo you know where you are going?\u201d we asked. \u201cNo, I feel rather lost,\u201d they would say. \u201cBut you are welcome to join, and we can pave a new path together.\u201d In that moment, though we were all still lost, we felt a glimpse of home. Our hearts connected and friendships formed on the simplest notion of being aimless wanderers together. \u201cYour thoughts and feelings make sense given all that you\u2019ve been through. Others may not understand, but I can see, because I\u2019ve walked a similar path.\u201d \u201cYou belong here.\u201d Our hearts began to relax. We took a deep breath of fresh air. They said to come home.",

Their shape, their feel is still quite foreign, as if they don\u2019t belong. Because of course, they don\u2019t. I miss them. Sometimes it seems I should not say this, Or even dare to think it. I am alive. I should be grateful. And I am, but\u2026 I miss them. I didn\u2019t want to part with them and pretend it didn\u2019t matter. It did. It does. It always will. I know now that grief and gratitude can co-exist. And so I\u2019m done pretending. I miss them. It\u2019s okay to feel this way and say so right out loud. And so I\u2019m done pretending.
