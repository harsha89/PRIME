      "Content": "I have  been offered a choice of weekly Paclitaxel for 12 weeks plus Herceptin for 12 months OR Docetaxel with Carboplatin every three weeks for 18 weeks plus Herceptin for 12 months.  I had a left side mastectomy on 3 August. It was a 60 mm lesion but the invasive part was only 14mm, (it was surrounded by LCIS and DCIS).  The invasive cancer is mainly lobular, T1, HER2+, Grade 2, lymph node negative, clear margins. So it's small and my prognosis is good, so i am told, but I am aware that statistics don't always work out in a positive way and my cancer is, by its nature, more aggressive and more likely to spread and recur. The weekly Paclitaxel is a tempting option because it is 'gentler' and it is the Herceptin that i will really benefit from, again, so i am told. But should I be 'hitting this cancer with everything I can' instead of choosing the easy option? My oncologist said the weekly Paclitaxel is a perfectly reasonable choice in her opinion but she could not say hand on heart that is was as effective as the combined DOC/Carbo as the evidence is not there yet for women in my position. I can't find any research evidence looking at these options. What should I do? ",

      "Content": "Hello, I had a left side mastectomy last August and an immediate reconstruction with implant. It is much smaller than the other side, I was a FF cup and the new breast is probably only a C or D (difficult to size when there is only the one!) and I hate being uneven. I am booked in for the surgery to reduce and lift the natural breast and have a couple of questions.  How long does it take to recover? I have already had 7 months off work and will be going back for three months before I have this surgery and would like to warn my manager that I will need time off again.  Also, what are other people's experiences of the sensation in the nipple after the surgery? I have been told the nipple will be moved and they will try to make sure there is no nerve damage so that it should feel the same afterwards. Is this true? Will it really feel the same?  Finally, I am wondering whether to ask the surgeon to adjust the shape of the implant side. It is slightly 'squared off' on the inner side nearest the cleavage and when I look down it annoys me. I don't know whether to have more surgery on that side, even if it is only a small adjustment, because what if it looks even worse or I get an infection in that wound?  Am i being too picky? What have other women done? My surgeon did originally say it was 'a work in progress' and that he could adjust it but I didn't see him at the last appointment when my surgery got booked in. just one of his team who kind of played it down.  Thanks ladies. xx ",
