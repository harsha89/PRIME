We all have to face the enormity of this at some point and in our own way. Its wonderful to smile in recovery. I'm so glad you want to smile, I'm a smiler myselfvery often. I'm also someone who has been devastated my the ongoing shock of my cancer diagnosis but most people in my life dont know because I'm a doer, I don't like moaning, and I'm blooming hilarious ! However I need to be real sonewhere.  The finger wagging \"be positive\" \"be strong\" \"be grateful\" brigade, help many but can also upset a lot more who are still struggling and are more sensitive and may take longer to deal with their Cancer. I am honestly still in shock. One year on. My consultant said PTSD is quite usual for many of us for years, but you can be happy in parrallel too.  Blessings to all of you  Dulcie",

For instance all my friends got fat on HRT but I lost weight on oestrogen only patches.... which of course probably contributed to my highly hormonally reactive breast cancer... now on letrozole my body won't give up the fat easily....

He had also told me that I will not be co sidered for reconstructive surgery because of  my BMI is too high. I'm feeling pretty bad about myself at the moment. And wonder if this is just standard practice. Has anyone been faced with the same situation ? Can I challenge his decision?   Oh Blimey, poor you. As if you don't feel bad enough already.

Re creams I only used Aloe Vera or coconut oil and was never sore and did not burn. I was told to use Factor 50 if I ever go in the sun.

Good luck with your decision, when do you have your surgery ? i am booked in for 23 November, but if I go for the bilateral it will be delayed as I have to see a psychologist to make sure the decision is ok for me.

I'm just wanting to get this first part done now and get the cancer out, who knows what will happen next.  I'm trying to be positive as much as possible but have bad times too. Reading the book Biology of Belief and finding it fascinating. Also read Beat Cancer & Reclaim your health so eating loads ( not all ) vegan foods and consulting homeopath and tapping ( EFT ) as well as taking surgeon and BC Nurses advice. Keeping me busy anyhow ! I'm a \"doer\" and beed to at least feel I can \"do\" something to help myself.  ????????????!!!Soooo any advice please re what to take with me to hospital ? Guessing Pyjamas best ( had total knee replacement last year and nightie best for acess to that ! ) ?????????????? Any other bits of advice ?I'm calm  on the outside tummy started the occasional lurch when I think of what is ahead. Good Luck to all my wonderful supportive fellow travellers.

I'm scared. Scared of being skint, scared of becoming a sofa sloth ( not gonna happen ) just scared of this huge change. Instinctively it feels right tho.

My husband has said he will support me too but he is more optimistic than me financially altho he works for himself and wages can vary, I was always the big earner but now he says it's his turn.

I had a left mastectomy dure to large (9cm) ductile tumour plus extensive dcis and a couple of little tiddlers. I'm not blasé its just 6 months since my op and you do evetually calm down although I am still in diagnosis shock if that makes sense. So .... I had Mx Sentinal node biopsy, and immediate recon as i was not expected to need Radiotherapy. On discovering the hugeness of my tumour I was then advised to have RT to prevent recurrence in chest wall and skin ( yuk !)  My implant has suffered, shrunk, gone lumpy and is tight and mishapen ( lovely !.) I may leave it alone or I might have it replaced or removed I haven't decided yet. The skin needs to recover from the RT sunburn in anycase. My observations are as follows 1) mastectomy with recon - nowhere near as painful as I imagined ( nothing like the pain of my knee replacement ) 2) size match of silicone implant was much smaller than natural breast and even smaller after RT 3) they did not know I would need RT or would not have agreed to immediate implant 4) i had big tumour but no node involvement 5) i did not like the drains but they are fine, sore but not painful 6) i had seroma - fill up of fluid and had it drained once which was idd but fine 7) i did not need chemo as onco dx test had score of  zero then 10 8) for me the emotional shock of diagnosis  ( where you are now ) was and is the worst bit of this whole cancer scare 9) for me - and this is just for me as its so idividual, even tho my implant in odd and bumpy now I am glad I had it as I still have a slight cleavage and I am a person who cares  10) I really thought a mishapen implant would be horrific - it isn't - its healing well - just bumpy 11) however awful this all is its better than the alternative Hope this helps you... Good Luck and keep asking questions - in time you can help others Dulcie ",

I totally understand your anger - mine presents as shock ! Im still in shock Total Mx 23-11-15 finished RT last week. I seem to constantky chant WTF in my head. I have no mental filing system for this... I had never really imagined how a cancer diagnosis would affect me emotionally. I get myself positive and think about great things and how to recast my life ( we can always make pisitive choices ) then I get a letter for people with \"life limiting illnesses \" and I'm all over the place, my head can't file that one. I'm determined to make the next chapter matter, to have fun and not just sleepwalk through the life I have left. I am desperate to know how long I have so I can plan and prioritise, I so dont want to work myself to death always waiting gor the good stuff to happen, but no b*gger can tell me.  I have decided to \"just go for it !' and live like I will live forever and still to fit in as many great things as I can. I wish you all the very best, enjoy your walk and stamp out that anger and then maybe plan some wonderful things, there is no one to blame.  Hope im not preaching  Dulcie  ",

She will help me look at the pros and cons of the variables the surgeon left me to decide. The only definite is I need one total mastectomy on my left breast where there is a large area of DCIS, calcisfication and a small different area of invasive cancer which has been identified from biopsies. There could be more of course. Due to my very strong family history ( mother 2 maternal aunts and maternal cousin all having BC ) surgeon said it might be wise to have a bilateral mastectomy to prevant any future cancer in the other breast. I also have to decide if I want immediate or delayed reconstruction (s)  ( implants ) as I couldn't face the other type as such huge operations, or indeed no reconstruction at all. My my mind is just ceased up.  What at do reconstructed breasts look like ? My leaflet said they don't look like normal breasts.  How did other people decide ? I know it's personal but I would appreciate some of your advice and any things you wish you had known and would or wouldn't have done again? I'm 61 and still care what I look like but I'm not in my 30's as some of you lovely young women are... I am however still totally shocked and still trying to process all this.... btw you are all right, it is the waiting that's the hardest bit. This bit isn't great, but at least I k ow what's happening next and as much as they know for now. Bloody Nora, I had great tits as well ! ",
