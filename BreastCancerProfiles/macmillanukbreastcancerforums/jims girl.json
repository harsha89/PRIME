      "Content": "Hi Janet, Feels as though I'm writing to myself!  I'm Janet, post menpausal, had mastectomy and complete removal of lymph glands on that side.  The mastectomy was surprisingly painless I found.  The arm MUST be exercised and for me that was both the only chore but also the most rewarding aspect of the job.  I put on a CD of Sousa marches and worked out a routine of arm raising aligned with the cornice of the room.  To see yourself getting higher each week was great.  The other movements mimicked various swimming strokes and 'towelling down' the back afterwards.  Caused my grandchildren some merriment but it was good fun doing it altogether!  I was told to get a sports bra and got that on fairly soon afterwards once the drains were removed. I too had an implant inserted at the time which was gradually filled with saline over six months to stretch the skin (totally painless). (Great to look down post op and see yourself not really flat) Then on the anniversary of the first op I had the implant removed and the definitive one put in its place.  Bingo!  Now lined up to have a brand new nipple and then the finishing touch of a tattoo!  Everyone concerned, particularly my plastic surgeon, has been absolutely ace and the care taken over a 72 year old is really touching. Now been on Arimidex for sixteen months, which is the drug of choice for post menopausal women.  We moan but it's better than the alternative!  I just feel lacking in energy, not depressed but I guess we are all different.  The effects are due to your body coping with total lack of oestrogen - that which makes you feminine.  I do wish you well.  Don't be scared, it's not worth the energy.  Janet",

      "Content": "Hallo again Janet.  Just got back from Poland visiting my little grandson so I've been out of the conversation a bit. Regarding expanders v finished implant.  I wondered why this had to be done myself.  I think that it is due to the fact that after the removal of the breast tissue you inevitably have a raw surface within the breast and this will lead to contraction of the tissue. (Think how scar tissue forms)  I know that when they removed my expander to replace it with the finished article they found that there were a lot of adhesions that had formed over the six months.  They  were able to remove these at the second op. before inserting the lasting implant.  Wednesday today.  Do write down your questions for your surgeon on Friday.  They will otherwise go out of your head! Love Janet",

      "Content": "Hi Janet.  Well, my dear old mum used to say \"Today is the tomorrow you worried about yesterday, and all is well!)  How our minds do work overtime to prepare us for the worst.  I suppose it's all part of human survival.  I'm so glad that everything went so smoothly and that you were discharged so quickly.  Our thoughts are now with Celia who is into her third day now so we should have some news from her soon.  I know just what you mean about the boring exercises.  That's why I equipped myself with the Sousa marches and I can't recommentd them highly enough.  They have a very steady 2 beat which makes them very useful for a sequence of moves in eights I found, like - up up up up ,down down down down , out out out out , down down down down.  My personal favourite moves were as in swimming - one breast stroke lasting for four beats, repeat 8 times, one back stroke lasting for four beats, then the other arm, repeat eight times etc with crawl added on.  Then pretend you have a towel and towel your back - up on one side, down on the other, repeat on the other side.  You can then 'comb your hair' when you are 'dry'.  All good fun and much more interesting than a sheet of paper! Sorry, I sound like an old mother in law! I do wish you a full and quick recovery.  Fingers crossed for the 13th. Love Janet/ Jims giirl  ",

      "Content": "Good to make contact with you Jaloco/Janet.  I too was offered the bigger op for reconstuctive purposes.  My reaction to that was that I probably needed any muscle that I possess (which they would have removed from the shoulder blade area or the abdomen)  for the next few years of my life so went for the simpler operation.  Absolutely no regrets.  They match perfectly when I am clothed, but as the plastic surgeon warned beforehand they can't create a 'droop' so the implant is probably not so good on women with large breasts. - but don't quote me on that.  If you google breast reconstruction you can see photographs of the various stages which I found very encouraging.  I have never been very well endowed so am more than satisfied with the new one.  Probably rather perkier than the remaining one!  As far as the lymph nodes were concerned, they found one microcalcification on the initial examination which could possibly have indicated that something was about to change and that made them remove all the nodes just to be sure.  No more were found after the main op so I guess I was very fortunate not to have to have more treatment.  I found that the mental approach of \"Well this is all going to be very interesting and will give me great insight \" was the most helpful attitude to take and honestly you've little to fear, but fear.  Hang on in there, the waiting is the worst part, I know. All the best ,Jims Girl  (and Jim is really very impressed with the results so far!)",

      "Content": "Well, we've got Sheila and Janet neck and neck at the moment!  Well done both of you.  You have both had a positive visit to your respective hospitals.  Are you beginning to be a little impressed with the seamless organisation?  I must say I couldn't fault mine (Addenbrookes in Cambridge).  Somehow the sheer numbers that they deal with gives one more confidence. I think that the uncertainty about the number of days in hospital revolves around the fact that you have to wait until your drains are collecting less fluid, which happens gradually each day.  They therefore can't say for sure how long it will be and she was probably preparing you for the worse scenario.  I was in for 7 days- I suspect until they desperately needed the bed for someoone else!  By the end of that time I was raring to go.  Good book, radio or earphones, sudoku if that's your bag and crosswords, you'll find the time goes remarkably quickly and the rest will do you a lot of good.

      "Content": "Hi Janet.  Jims girl here.  I do hope you will keep posting and let us know when you are going for your op.  It helped me such a lot to know that six carefully selected people were thinking of me and saying a quiet prayer when I had my mastectomy.  No-one else knew and still do not know in our village.  Goes to show it wasn't such a ghastly experience. In fact I was so uplifted that week in hospital that I asked them if they had given me blood!  They hadn't and what is more I never had to ask for pain killers either.  I think the relief that it was all done and dusted was so good.  I was back into social life the next week too. Not energetically you understand but we went to the theatre and a lecture and I was even dug in the ribs by a friend who was not in the know (because she is a terrible gossip).  All quite amusing! Thinking of you, keep your chin up! Janet",
