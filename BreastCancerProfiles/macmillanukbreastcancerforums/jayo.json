    "Content": "Hi Tracey, You might find this helpful.... I had 25 RT sessions and I found that, as well using the aqueous cream they provide, 99.9% pure Aloe Vera gel seemed to quell my skin.  (It's well known for its treatment for sun-burn and fire burns).  As it was, my skin went red, a bit itchy and  towards the end,  a little raw ...... but nothing to really complain about. A month later it is nearly normal looking with no discomfort at all.  I am taking some herbal supplements to help heal too so I can't say it's all down to the Aloe Vera.  I'm now growing an  Aloe Vera pot plant and now use a leaf's worth of goo per day .... I think I may be addicted!!! Anyway, best wishes. Jayo",
