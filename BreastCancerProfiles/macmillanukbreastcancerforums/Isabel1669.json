    "Content": "Hi Mulheron ,  I've got the same symptoms , at first I thought just an inverted nipple but noticed today that the areola is also longer & wider than the other side & seems to have a sort of halo half way round it , can't find any lumps in the breast or in the armpit .   I saw my GP last Thursday & have an appointment at the Breast Clinic on Sat , just wondering what was your outcome ? As most of the experiences I've read are from those who found a lump . I'm not pretty convinced it's going to be Cancer as all the information I've found keeps coming back to the same outcome .",
