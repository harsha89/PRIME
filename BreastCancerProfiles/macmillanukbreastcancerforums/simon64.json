      "Content": "On 1st September 2010, I lost my partner sharon to secondary breast cancer. She was diagnosed with breast cancer in January 2008 and had a mastectomy and several courses of chemotherapy and radiotherapy and lost her hair but then about a year after being diagnosed she started to get back to normal. We went on holiday to Las Vegas in April 2009 and Lanzarote in December 2009. In April 2010 Sharon started to get a very tickly throat and was coughing a lot so I told her to go to the hospital who made her an appointment for a CT scan.  Sharon had the scan and then went back for the results a couple of weeks later and was told that the cancer had gone to her liver. She battled on very bravely and even did the race for life in June. I was so proud of her. I was at Sharon's side when she died. She was only 52. I miss her so much.",
