    "Content": "Hi Ladies, I'm new to this site and I have just been reading all the messages on here about losing your hair and it's giving me a huge reality check. I've just had 2 operations to remove my breast lump and lymph nodes and am due to start the FEC chemo in a couple of weeks. I think i'm prepared for the whole hair loss thing and have already been looking at wigs but it makes me feel so upset reading all this, i'm pretty scared to be honest as I've always had a good hair of glossy hair.  Shall I just go for the short crop now and be done with it to start getting used to it? What do most people do? Looking forward to some nice chats, Tracy x ",
