That was four years ago now, but I had a brochure to choose from, so maybe you could enquire at the Macmillan unit where you were treated. Best wishes for a lovely holiday and safe journeying.",

Make sure first that you are really up to it, and feel fit as children will be very interested in what you have to say and you may be asked questions. With very  best wishes to you for even thinking of doing this during your treatment, A big hug for you and your neice, so good of you to think of other children.",

      "Content": "I had similar trouble with my hair.  At first it began to grow back like baby hair, then as it grew longer it stuck out every which way and was hard to manage.  My friend trimmed it for me and then after some time when it was longer she gave me a light perm.  This was fine and lasted several months.  I have had several light perms since and gradually my hair grew longer and I began to roll it up like I used to do.  It did not happen overnight, so be patient and do not give up, it WILL get easier for you. You are most likely younger than me, [I'm 83 now and my chemo was in 2012], so there is every chance yours will behave in a shorter time than mine did. All the very best to you for your wedding,",

      "Content": "Re curly Chemo hair At first baby hair appeared.  I really thought it would be curly, but when it grew stronger it stuck out every which way and was hard to manage.  My friend trimmed it several times and then when it was long enough she gave me a light perm.  I used to have a natural \u2018kink\u2019, and now I no longer need to have it permed I am rolling it up like I used to and it keeps it\u2019s curl.  Thankfully the spiky hardness has gone. You must be a lot younger than me as I am 83yrs, so I expect you your hair will grow quicker than mine did. With best wishes for your wedding.   Jeanie D",

If you only read that far, it is a tonic. Best of luck with your search.",

Check it out with your GP if it does not clear up.  Three years after Chemo I had a really bad session, whether it was connected with Chemo or old age, I shall never know but my knee seized up and an Xray revealed severe Osteoporosis, so have been put on Calcium. Might not be connected, but better to be safe than let it get worse. Keep a check on your weight, particularly if it is going down.",

      "Content": "Hallo Silver cloud, There is a silver lining.  I wanted to be prepared for whatever was coming my way and knew very little, and put together a list of questions which if I had joined this group in the beginning would probably have made life a lot easier.  I searched the net: Chemotherapy regimens From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to: navigation, search However here is the list that I took with me to see the Oncologist: Chemotherapy Radiotherapy questions Hair Will my hair fall out, and should I cut my plait off before it does?  If a wig is needed, where are they available? How much notice is required before a wig can be provided?  Cost, do I pay, or is it provided through the N.H.S.?  Is there a choice regarding wigs?  After effects What are the after effects of Chemo?  Does it cause Nausea? Is there a tablet/pill to take if it causes nausea? If so what is it?  Does it affect breathing and what causes this?  Does it stop normal activities like housework, shopping etc.   If I have Chemo. is radiotherapy necessary?  Radiotherapy  If too much sun causes Cancer, isn\u2019t that the same as having radiotherapy which uses X-rays, so how can radiotherapy help ?  How much radiation will cause blisters on the skin? Because I have a sensitive skin and use aqueous cream [not soap] and if it blisters the skin, can treatment be stopped, and what would be the consequences? What medication is the antidote? ie. Cream, and can it be used before or after treatment? [Had I belonged to this group I would have got the answer!]  Is special clothing required for protection of other parts of the body? Where would this be obtained from?                   Will it affect my breathing   When I had finished asking questions the Oncologist said to me, \u201cStop thinking!\u201d  Then she said, \u201cEverybody is different I will make out a plan for you.\u201d   This ended the questioning session, while  she  made a quick sketch, of the treatments. Stop thinking, [and I can\u2019t] a strange thing to  say, but in hindsight, she was probably advising me to stop worrying and not to cross my bridges before I got to them.  She did comment on sunshine with some agreement.  It is useful to ask what you might need so that you can purchase the necessary goods in advance, like a digital thermometer, and if you have Chemo, scarves, and a special brush, shampoo for a wig. You will get advice all the way along as your treatment progresses.  So that is what the Oncologist was probably thinking.  The main thing is not to worry, and take things steady. Think positively. I did think that if my appointments were at the beginning of the week, and I was worried about anything, I would have a chance to ask before the week-end!! I hope all goes well for you, Love and hugs, Jeanied",
