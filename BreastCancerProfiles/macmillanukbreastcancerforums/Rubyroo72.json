    "Content": "Hi Mo Are you me?! I also had mastectomy (with tissue expander) and lymph nodes removed on 6th July and am starting FEC-T on 16th August!! Currently busy buying headbands for the scalp cooling I'm going to do, as I want to try to save my hair. Also bought a blender to make soups to put in the freezer in case I feel rubbish but need nourishment. For me the worst thing is not knowing how I'm going to react to the drugs. I hate feeling nauseous and am rarely sick, so even this is worrying. Have you been for a chemo assessment yet? I had one on Friday and visited my chemo day unit and found it all very useful and interesting. The nurse told me I'd probably need a PICC line after the first couple of cycles, but not immediately. Have booked a long weekend in Devon next weekend for something to distract me ahead of the first cycle. Hopefully keep in touch. Bex",
