      "Content": "I have been getting quite a bit of shoulder an chest pain since surgery a year ago, and have only been able to wear my old bras with worn out elastic? Anything tight round my chest or over shoulders brought on the pain! Last month I spent quite a bit of time measuring and trying on bras in marks&sparks and found I needed a bigger size and wider straps than before. I now have some new bras which I have to confess look more functional than those I wore before, but my shoulder and chest pain is so much better, and to be honest, the bra doesn't show once clothes are on. I'm just happy find that there was a simple answer to the problem . Sports bras are comfortable. Banana girl",
