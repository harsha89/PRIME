    "Content": "I was diagnosed with breast cancer. I had my mammogram and nothing was picked up. I felt a lump a few months later and was given an ultra sound that came back as a cyst. I asked for another ultra sound as I felt it got smaller, this then came back as breast cancer. I have surgery Monday. I feel very confused, as I have none in the family , I eat health and I\u2019m relatively fit. I question hair dye or my glass of wine a night, two on weekends. Apparently it\u2019s invasive? My surgeon said they can\u2019t stage until they operate. I feel very scared, I have dropped the anger and I\u2019m trying too be positive. I decided for a partial mastectomy. I was given a choice? Not sure if I made the right choice of a full or partial?",
