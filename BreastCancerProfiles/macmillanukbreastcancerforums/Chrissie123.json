      "Content": "Hi Sacred heart, I found a huge tumour in my breast on 6th May, it came out of nowhere and was 5.9cm. Three weeks later I had a mastectomy and total lymph node clearance. I hadn't appreciated how high risk I was until I started asking the right questions. I have had 6 rounds of FEC-T chemotherapy and radiotherapy and am now on Herceptin injections and Anastrazole. I am now completely well, with minimal side effects. I had no partner to care for me, but my children are grown up.  I would ask friends to rally around, most people are happy to help with children and write down all the questions that you want answered, that you can ask the professionals. I believe that knowledge is power and it helps when you can understand what is going on. I know it is a frightening time for you, but treatment is good these days. Good luck and try to enjoy  Christmas with your boys.",

      "Content": "Hello ladies,  Have you been offered a cold cap? My oncologist said I would only have a 20% chance of keeping my hair, but I persevered, had my hair cut into a Bob and although I lost about 80% of my hair, I had enough left not to look like a chemo patient. Now my hair is growing again, it is a little difficult to manage, but the new hair is adding to the thickness of it. Try not to worry about letting loved ones see you, they will only be thankful that you a 're having treatment and will be well again in a few weeks.  I had a massive stage 3 tumour in May and now that the chemo and rads are finished, I feel very well, so there is light at the end of the tunnel x",

      "Content": "Hi Tilly,  It is horrible looking at a face that you don't recognise, mine was all puffy and without eyebrows and lashes, I felt I had little piggy eyes.  I finished my chemo in October, and now have my brows and lashes back. My hair is also growing quickly. I found makeup to be my saving grace. There are lots of good little blogs on YouTube, by ladies, also on chemo, with great tips on how to apply cleverly. It may seem trivial, but it helped me to be able to look at myself in the mirror without wincing. None of us are the same after cancer, but there is a whole new you to explore for now and in the future! Good luck! X",

      "Content": "Hi YorkA, You are right, it is hard, but take each day at a time. I was diagnosed with Stage III Invasive Breast Cancer on the 20th May. The tumour came out of nowhere and was 5.9 cm, with 4 lymph nodes diseased. I was horrified that I hadn't found it before, and my routine mammogram was due three days after I found it. I had my mastectomy and total lymph node clearance ten days later and because of the aggressive nature of my tumour, I have had the maximum doses of all my treatments. So, seven months down the line, I am perfectly well. I have three weekly Herceptin injections with minimal side effects. All the advice you have been given will take a while to digest, and everyone is different, but listen to your body and go with it. If you need to rest, rest and don't worry about superficial things. My husband left the day of my diagnosis, a blessing in the end, as I didn't have to worry about him. My saving grace was my dog, and without my husband, I had to walk him every day. Exercise is the single most important thing, to promote recovery ( and I don't mean hammering the gym, 40 minutes gentle walk is fine, or even 20). Two days after finishing my radiotherapy, I flew to the States and I am now planning a trip to see the Northern Lights. There are positives that come from having cancer, and one of them is that it focusses your mind on the important stuff. Life is good, choose life and let the medics get on with your treatment. Good luck, the next few months will fly by and you can look forward to a healthy future with your family",

      "Content": "Hello Lujay, Good luck for tomorrow, I am sure that you will find it less scary once the treatment is underway, with less side effects without the F. Ask about your Breast care nurse while you are there, and jot down any other questions as they pop into your head. Everybody is in the same boat and chemo nurses are generally very kind. They know how frightening and confusing it can all be. Take care xx",
