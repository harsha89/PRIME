      "Content": "Hi,  I feel for you because I went through an awfull time trying to get my head around my score too. It was 21 and this threw me, my oncologist explained that the risks of chemo outweighed the less than 3% benefit.  On reading all I could in general I found up to 25 score chemo isn't normally offered by most. Someone stated this was the case with her oncologist in America too.  The predict tool was also used by my team and result written was 1% benefit.  I will have my first yearly breast clinic appointment this week with results from the mammogram. It is probably playing on my mind a bit hence I'm looking in on here and replying at this time. Don't often post but do look in.  I hope this may help you. ",

      "Content": "Hi,  My oncologist said her protocol follows guidelines not to give chemo for a score under 25 so at 21 I wasn't given the decision to make. Don't know if that was good or bad, had told her the score of 21 threw me because in my mind a score 20-24 would be in my grey area.  That is when she showed me the predict score of 1% they had done. Also she said benefit of chemo in this instance would not be enough considering the risks it brings.  It may also depend on any other medical conditions that could be affected by chemo too ie tailoring treatment to each individual as they do.  You don't know what the oncologist is going to say yet. You could list the main questions that pop up in your mind until your appointment ... Then they are off your mind and on paper ready to ask, is it morn or afternoon?   Ps. I went to a friends house for her big birthday do ...in case you are wondering why I answered at this hour sorry.  Just to let you know too we celebrated my first year post op/RT clear mammogram results (I got in the week) as well. I had been quite unsettled for the week before my appointment and understand we probably all do to different extents ... So do feel for you but not long now. X A ",

Just had 2nd post op mammo= NAD... Yay!

My GP will have been sent the letter from hosp re post parathyroid and cholesterol blood test results... I presume he will contact me to discuss statin if he thinks nec.  The thing that would sway me is if (as I have read research for and against) certain statins can help reduce breast cancer recurrence and mortality.  Perhaps someone in 'ask the experts' would be able to clarify the confusing conclusions I've read whether a good idea to take if could help with both.  It makes all the difference being able to talk to all on here, thanks again. ",

I would have had to let here know how upset and angry it made me fee, why we are now like this and that unless she had experience of it has no right to make cruel comment !   I completed RT 5 wks ago and chemo was not advised. I discovered a lump elsewhere that I have left for at least a couple of months and may well be nothing but I don't really know how long it has been there . To be on the safe side will be ct and u/s scanned this wk and next. The GP ref me to Dr in hosp ENT opd who ordered these after seeing nothing from the ent scope that would be causing it. Before I would probably have left the painful stiff neck (or at least for longer). Ps. My bc could not be felt and was only discovered on routine mammogram screening, grade 2, clear margins, no nodes. I have always been healthy then from 55 over the last couple of years have been diagnosed with quite a few medical conditions.  Hope this one is nothing to do with the bc or any thing sinister separately. Once this and another I am waiting surgery for are sorted I hope for no more or at least a long break to enjoy life again...to an extent. There is a need to be more vigilant  as we know but others without this experience will not understand. Hope you are over the upset now x    ",

Yes I agree go in to your app prepared with all questions you think might help a decision and if you need a bit longer to discuss with others ask for it . Cant remember if you asked the oncologist or breast nurse what they would do or would advise a member of there family...that may help if you haven't.

Up to 18 is low risk, next up to 31 is intermediate, after that is high. I read that in America a consultant said he would not recommend chemo for a score under 25. The guidance in my area is the same. I had in my mind before I went in for results that 20 - 25 would be the score that would really throw me. When my oncologist said \"I am pleased to say no chemo nec.\" I asked the sore and it was 21, she wondered why I was not all smiles too. Then explained that the small amount of benefit there could be would be negated by the risks there could be of chemo. I asked what would she advise a member of her family with this score and she said not to have chemo. I wasn't really given a decision to make. She also then gave me the predict tool score printout which came out at chemo benefit 1%.   I finished radiotherapy about 2 wks ago now and have follow up with her 4-6wks after. Did wonder if the RT makes any difference to the % because the oncotype DX score  printout does not mention RT as far as I can see.  Hope I may have been of some help x ",
