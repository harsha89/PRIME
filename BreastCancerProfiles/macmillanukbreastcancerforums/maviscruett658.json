      "Content": "Hi there I was diagnosed initially in 1999, had chemo radio and a following tram flap, like your wife, was re-diagnosed in 2006 with secondaries in my liver, I've had chemo again and been on herceptin ever since (which is almost 2 years now). Although some similarities between our stories I have found it helpful to focus on knowing what I'm dealing with, sometimes I have found the not knowing worse. I am about to turn 40 in a couple of months and feel it is a real milestone. I sincerely hope you find the answers you are looking for and the strength from knowing you are never alone, either of you. Kind regards Tina",

      "Content": "Hi Carol I am so sorry I do not have any medical answers to your vein issues, in terms of why, but I do share similar problems with the nurses getting a vein good enough to provide my treatment. I have also had gland and nodal clearance, have now had two lots of chemo and have most recently been on herceptin for two years (without a line). If I had to have more chemo I would certainly opt for a line, I had a picc line with my first lot of chemo 8 years ago and it was yery sucessful and much less stressful than trying to get working veins every time. Although I have avoided it for the last 2 years as I have a 2 year old, it hasn't been without its trials for me and the nurses who have to treat me. With regards to your hair, I have lost mine both times and have dealt with it differently both times, first time I didn't care, this time I have been much more sensitive about it as I felt it was a defining point in terms of my cancer and was acutely aware of people \"staring\", in truth many of the glances were from other Mum's in the playground, who have since admitted they were glances of admiration and a wish to help but not knowing how. Please be reasurred whatever you are feeling it is not stupid or silly its very real. If you are lucky enough to have a macmillan centre locally they run a fabulous course called \"looking good and feeling great\" it deals specifically with looks, hair loss and make up and the emotions that cancer patients feel, stuff like that, I know many people who would recommend it. I sincerely hope that this helps in any small way, please know you are never alone. Kind regards Tina",
