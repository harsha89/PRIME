      "Content": "Hi Carmen, 'One day at a time' is really good advice.  I am two years further down the line from you and it is amazing how quickly you and your family adjust to a new 'normality' once you step off the precipice and start treatment!  I have two young children and made it to the school Nativity play shortly after my initial surgery.  It was emotional and I blubbed my way through it (even more than normal ;-)) There is no denying that you have a tough time ahead but you will get through it - I can also confirm that there is light at the end of the tunnel! I hope everything goes well for you. J",

      "Content": "Hi there, I'm new to this forum and think I put my original post in the wrong place so apologies for cross posting!   Not sure if anyone can advise, but I have been through a lumpectomy and node removal, chemo, radiotherapy and herceptin to treat breast cancer.  My consultant advised that I needed to have a mastectomy but that I would have to wait for at least three months after I completed herceptin...all treatment was very good and joined up until now.   I have now been waiting for over six months for a mastectomy date and the possible dates keep getting put back.  I feel like my life has been put on hold until I get this last stage of treatment over but when is it reasonable to start to complain or become bolshy? Any help or experiences would be appreciated! J",
