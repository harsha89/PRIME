    "Content": "Hi bobbiedazzler I'm a year down the line now and remember those feelings well. I had invasive lobular in three places, very small and stage 2, mastectomy was the next step. My op was on April 29th last year and my daughters wedding was on May 17th! Can I just say I was the last to leave the party!!! As my friends would re-iterate that's my usual!! I know you are thinking you won't be able to do this that or the next thing but honestly you will get there.

Each step of your diagnosis and treatment will take a few days/weeks to get your head round but you sound like you've a good sense of humour and believe me, mine has been my saviour in the last year. Good luck with everything xxx",
