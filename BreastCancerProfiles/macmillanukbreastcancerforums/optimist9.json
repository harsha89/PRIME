    "Content": "Hi..I was also diagnosed with breast cancer two weeks ago and I had surgery last monday...Hopefully, tomorrow I will get the histology results on the Sentinal nodes they removed...and the margin round the tumour...I have still got the dye like you, but I was told by the breast care nurse that it will disperse over the next weeks to months!! Are you having any further treatment? Stay strong..it is another challenge that we have to deal with....",
