    "Content": "I am new too, had a mastectomy done 22 years ago, and again 4 days ago, the other breast. No reconstruction done. I feel now very mutilated and feel very depressed. Would like to lay in bed all day, with the blanket over my head. I am waiting for the results of the 2 lymph nodes, which were removed. Might take at least another 10 days. I don't know how to get through those days, but I cannot really show much emotions or depression to my husband and son. How are you dealing with it?",
