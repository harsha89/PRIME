      "Content": "Thanks Lesley your life sounds like mine as I do Husband\u2019s accounts too and care for elderly parents on top of everything else. When MRI and CT came back clear I had to remind hubby that I still had cancer and was facing surgery and radiotherapy! He has just thrown himself into getting even more work and spends evenings taking calls . I\u2019ve 2 grown up children at home and do a lot for them, lunches and washing as I\u2019m seen as not having a proper job since I retired from midwifery a few years ago ( stressed) . I know it\u2019s my fault but it\u2019s the carer in me.  I take the dog on long country walks at the moment as it\u2019s my time to think and the scenery gives me a boost as I love nature. It\u2019s nice to know people in a similar situation as I don\u2019t think you can truly empathise unless you have been there, no matter how much you love the person.  Ta x",

      "Content": "I\u2019ve been lurking around reading all your helpful posts since the end of February when I got my diagnosis and have gone through the usual testing MRI and CT .  I\u2019m sort of embarrassed to say I\u2019m stressed/struggling as you have all had difficult times. I\u2019m booked for lumpectomy (in armpit) and sentinel node biopsy on the 4 April and the waiting is so hard . Life is just plodding on but inside I\u2019m screaming \u201cI\u2019ve got f@@@ing cancer!\u201d And I feel so alone even when the house is full. Lots of other family things going on too, daughter just been dumped 4 weeks before having baby, other daughter having to sort childcare as I look after granddaughter. I feel like I\u2019ve still got to support them but being selfish expecting something back.  So I\u2019m posting on here before I explode or melt due to the extreme hot flushes I\u2019m now getting!  Thanks for being there over the last few weeks and hope you will hold my hand on the 4th April.

      "Content": "Hi, is it definitely a haematoma or isn\u2019t it a seroma ? Seroma are very common following SND and feel like a water balloon under the skin . Get it checked out with the breast care nurse as it may need draining if painful.  I had a seroma after the same surgery, it came up by day 5 and ended up being drained a couple of times before developing a leak of its own. I\u2019m now about 9 weeks post op and all has healed. It was very painful and I ended up in A and E one weekend being given Oramorph and having it drained.  I had cocodamol And ibuprofen for pain and also trammadol at night for a short time as it was so bad . ( Thanet can be addicting so be careful)  I found wrapping a large bandage around my chest, shoulder and armpit tightly helped a bit . I was quite miserable but it does get better eventually.  Get seen by your breast care nurse for advice .  Sending a virtual hug. Xx",

It\u2019s now resolving and feels like a sausage in my armpit!  For pain relief I had Co-codamol 30/500 (paracetamol and codiene)prescribed by gp . I also had neurofen which I took and when it was really tense I had some Trammadol at night .  I found that it was more comfy if I applied pressure to it so I got a big crepe bandage and bound around the armpit, chest and shoulder.  I was totally miserable as even with the drugs it was uncomfortable. I\u2019m feeling much better now so it does resolve. Go to Gp and got something stronger than paracetamol to take with the neurofen.  Xx",

Although I\u2019m 7 weeks post op my armpit is still uncomfortable at times but much improved from when the seroma was active. Honestly it does get better and less painful, try and remember that a good chunk of flesh has been removed and all the underlying tissues have to heal too . I\u2019ve just had a bit of my scar reopen with a bit of infection but within a week it\u2019s closing up .  It will heal and you will get your chemo/ radiotherapy. If you search \u201cseroma sisters\u201d there is an old thread where one lady had hers drained 33 times!  I know it\u2019s frustrating, I\u2019ve been there .  Sending you a virtual hug. Xx ",
