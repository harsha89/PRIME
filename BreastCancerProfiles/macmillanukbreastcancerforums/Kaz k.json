      "Content": "Hi  Has anyone found any difference in hair/eyelash loss between fec and docetaxel? I'm about to have my last fec and I've still got hair but with bald patches And still have eyelashes. Does docetaxel make your hair grow or make it thinner? Also has anyone found more side effects with the last 4 cycles or is it slightly easier? As I've had very few side effects with fec.  Kaz",

Op is in a few weeks but I'm going to see the doctor next Friday as I've got a sore armpit on the opposite side to my tumour with on one cancerous lymph node on the tumour side. Thanks Kaz",
