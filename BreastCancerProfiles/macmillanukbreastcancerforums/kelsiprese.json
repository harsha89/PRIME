      "Content": "Hi, Im not on Tamoxifen but I am a nurse and I would suggest going to your GP just to get yourself checked out. I had a mastectomy last week and get my lymph node histology next week; so I dont know about further treatment yet. However, my GP recently gave me some really good advice; dont try and self diagnose get yourself checked out and let them put your mind at rest. If there are other treatment options that will better suit you then you can find out about those too. Or get in touch with your breast care nurse. I hope this helps Kelly x",
