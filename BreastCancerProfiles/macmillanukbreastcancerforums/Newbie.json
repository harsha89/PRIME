I want to put a kit together to make the treatment days a little less daunting and uncomfortable - can you ladies suggest anything you found specially useful or helpful ? My own hubby (her brother) is also being treated right now so want to look out for them both.  Going shopping today so no pressure ☺ Thanks all x",
