You could also try John Hopkins ask an expert http://www.hopkinsbreastcenter.org/services/ask_expert/ though it may take 48 hours to get a response. Good luck with the results, Julesx      ",

      "Content": "Hi, I used Biafine as soon as my skin started to go red, just make sure you don't apply anything at least 4 hours prior to the treatment.  I also got a couple of yoga bras from Sweatty Betty made from bamboo they were really soft and not too tight. I am extremely fair and never go into the sun and I tolerated RT really well. I only had some reddening and slight peeling towards the end.   It's impossible to say who will have an easy time of the treatment and those that don't. As for fatigue I definitely felt it, the cumalative effects build up.  I had around 35 treatments and started to feel really tired towards the end.  If you are \"only\" having 15-20 treatments then you may not feel it at all. Good luck and wishing you very few side effects. Julesx    ",

A lot of people on another board were frightening me about the margins but I talked to my medical team and they told me that in 20% of cases it is not possible to get them due to the location of the tumour. My case is different to you as I had lumpectomy followed by radiation around 35 doses which included 6 boosts. I was told if I had a masectomy I would probably need radiation as well. I also went through chemo as a preventative measure as I was quite young at the time of diagnosis (38). Even though our cases are different I just wanted to let you know that not having clear margins is more common than you think. I am one year on from diagnosis and I am NED. Good luck, Jules x",

However, you have only been finished from chemo for 3 months and hair does grow at different rates.  Hopefully your follicles are just taking awhile to wake up compared to the areas that are growing. I finished chemo 7 months ago and the hair at the back of my head is around 3.5 to 4\" long and the front and sides range from 2.5\" to 3 inches.  The side of my head by the temples was very slow to grow and I was concerned I was going to look bald then but it soon appeared. I would say not to stress.  To make hair grow I tried horsetail supplements which were recommended to me but they smelt of tobacco and I wasn't comfortable taking them.  I now take Biotin which people rave about but  I've also read it is not effective.  I guess you can't go wrong with a good diet and plenty of Omega 3. Good luck and wishing you good hair days.  I currently look like Ronald McDonald's sister.  It's ok from the front with a head band but the sides and back are so curly and out of control it's unbelievable.  Someone asked me the other day where I got my perm from sigh...........

From what I've read Tamoxifen builds bone density in post menopausal women BUT decreases it in pre menopause.  My oncologist says there is no need for me to take it.  I have been reading conflicting opinions but the majority view seems that pre menopausal women SHOULD be taking calcium supplements. So if you are pre menopausal are you taking calcium and if so what kind calcium citrate (sp) is supposed to be the \"best\"? Julesx  ",

I've been on it for 3 months now and so far it has been fine.  I've lost weight, I get minor night sweats occasionally (had about 5 so far) some pain in my knee and that is it.  I had mood swings for the first 2 weeks but they have gone.

I've stopped reading about Tamoxifen for the time being and just concentrating on relaxing until the radiation treatment starts.  After that I can stat thinking it.  My onocologist is great so if I have any problems I shall sort myself out. My treatment seems to be going fine.  The only problem I had was my right arm was very numb and inflexible after the lymph node clearance.  My physiotherapy was not good.  But when I met my surgeon he stretched the muscle as a band was forming causing me to be immobile.  Once he did that my life has become so much easier. I am now looking at my head and slowly there are signs of hair coming back I have some stubble there trying not to look at it too much but happy something is happening.........    ",

My scalp was getting really dry and the oil has helped a lot.  I've found a good site it shows the stages of hair growth http://www.karinstack.com/images/hair/HS_grid.jpg at 6 weeks I am basically at the stage of this lady.  I was also told Head & Shoulders works as this contains zinc which helps the hair grow quickly but I didn't try it as it is quite harsh.  My shampoo is SLS free which is genter than the regular shampoo.

      "Content": "Hi Ash, Thanks for the info regarding the MRI.  I'm assuming I am clear as the hospital haven't got back to me and have sent me a reminder to attend tomorrow for my simulation. Good luck with your meeting with the RT contsultant, but yeah I agree it's difficult to wait.  I have the exact same feelings as you but I think everybody goes through it.  I read an excellent book from the library (in fact it was so good I think I've renewed it about 5 or 6 times),  called \"Just Get Me Through This\" by an American  lady called Deborah Cohen.  She was diagnosed with  BC and she gives some really great advice  in an upbeat and positve way and what to expect in all stages of the journey. That is exciting about your eyelashes and eyebrows, I lost about 70% of my eyebrows and now I have a 5 o'clock shadow appearing there so something is happening. Who would have thought a year ago we would get excited by such small things but now mean so much! LOL re your husband but I can understand, now that I have started massaging my head I'm getting a bit addicted to it myself!  The cat has taken to sitting next to me on the sofa sniffing my head it seems she likes olive oil and likes to have a tablespoon or so (I guess she'll be having the shiniest coat)! Good luck yourself for Tuesday. Julesx      ",

Thought I would bring this subject again to see if everyboy is still having little side effects from taking Tamoxifen?  I am starting 23rd March after my Radiotherapy treatment. My oncologist didn't want me to start until after RT finishes as the side effects would be worse if I didn't wait, I have no problem with that ;) If anyone has put weight on, how do you control it exercise, diet (cutting down carbs etc).... any tips appreciated. I've read taking the tablet at night helps side effects but but my oncologist recommends taking them in the day so I get a good night's sleep (assuming I get hot flushes).  ",

That's what I have stubble, probably about 0.5 cm long but I was totally bald.  I think around 5 to 6 weeks is the norm for most people to see any sign of growth.  I'm getting a bit impatient and have a good look every morning.  I'm trying to make myself look once a week and that way I will definitely notice a change. My wig was really uncomfortable for the first 2 weeks but I perservered and now its really comfortable but I do use my scarves at home to give my head a chance to \"breathe\". Good luck with the Tamoxifen, I guess try not to think about it too much and that the side effects will be minimal.  Could you let me know what dosage they give you.  I had a brief chat with my oncologist about it and he told me about the weight gain but we won't be discussing the issue in depth until after the radiation.   Jules x    ",

What exactly does a hot flush feel like (I've been told by my friends when I get one I'll know what it is), my periods haven't stopped but they are very irregular and my last one was hardly noticeable.  I've felt my bones kind of \"warming\" up and that last for a couple of minutes but I doubt that would be a hot flush?  My memory is still terrible I forget EVERYTHING. I'll have a look out for the multi vitamins you mentioned.  Exciting your fingernails are growing back you must be pleased.  I am happy I can now look in the mirror and smile, my eyebrows are back and I have some signs of life on my head.  It sounds as if you are coping with Tamoxifen really well.

Having read this site and others,  it seems that the side effects the people experience really are awful.  Is Tamoxifen really that bad?  I know everyone experiences the drug differently but does it really effect the quality of life, will I be able to carry on working normally? I am really scared of taking it.  At least with chemo I knew I was going to feel lousy for the first week but after that I would go back to feeling great.  I just feel depressed that the next 5 years are just going to be miserable. Sorry I am  rambling but I am really getting myself in a state about this.  Any words of wisdom and reassurance would gratefully be received.

      "Content": "Hi, Just writing to wish everyone well.  I had my last chemo on 1st December and my hair is probably around 2 cms long now.  It is definitely lighter in colour.  My hair is naturally frizzy and unmanagable so I am hoping it will come back smooth and silky ;)  I massage my head with olive oil and take horsetail supplements which are supposed to help with the hair growing back healthier as I've been told chemo hair is often dry and brittle. Good luck everyone, chemo is an ordeal but once that is over Radiotherapy is a breeze. Jules x  ",

      "Content": "Hi, I've been on Tamoxifen for around 14 months and my cycle is between 21 to 43 days.  I was told I wouldn't go into menopause because of my age. How old are you?  Menopause usually starts around 50 but on chemo it may push you to start earlier. Julesx",
