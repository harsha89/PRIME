    "Content": "Hi Shaz, I had the same treatment as you and completed my last Taxotere 4 weeks ago. The achy bones that others described were the same for me. I just took Paracetamol, had warm baths and rested when I felt like it.  The main bummer for me were my feet. They swelled up quite a bit and made walking painful. I also had some of my toe and finger nails lifting, but am combating that by painting them nice dark autumnal colours so I don't see it. I keep them short, wear washing up gloves all the time when doing the dishes and so have kept them looking neat. If you have a good nail technician, I would speak to them and have regular file and paints each week for the fingers and every 3-4 weeks for the toes. My beautician is using a special file just for me and only wooden sticks to very gently push back the cuticles.  My feet have also had a lot of skin peeling off, but that wasn't painful at all, just unattractive. Again with the baths a a gentle pumice buff I got rid of that within a few weeks. I found reiki really useful for the swollen feet. and yoga. I also wear compression stockings whenever I can and try and walk a lot to circulate the blood. It's getting much better. I think the key thing is to stay positive and focus on your chemo end date. Always look on the bright side of life if my motto: I now have perfectly manicured fingers all the time and am getting more gentle exercise as I walk more. There: positive thoughts. :-)  Wishing you lots of strength to get through your Taxotere treatment! Alex",
