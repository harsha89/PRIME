      "Content": "Hi Caroline I too have been recently diagnosed with breast cancer - last week and also cannot believe it.  It feels unreal. I don't feel ill at all and surgery is on 4 July.  But leading up to that is MRI scan and a nuclear medicine scan and pre-assessment - and like you am desperately worried that its already spread.  So scary.... Everyone is being very, very supportive (family and friends) but none of them know in the dark of the night the terror I go through worrying about the unknown. I just keeping counting the sleeps down until the next time I might be told the next bad news - like with the MRI scan results about how big the actual cancer is, and when the final biopsy results are in.  Then after the op and knowing if it has actually spread further................. How do you get through all this without going out of your mind.  ",

I'm relatively new to all this - diagnosed in Mid June - still don't believe it can be true and I've had op and all the diagnosis info but still can't  believe it is happening to me! The only way is to take a day at a time and keep as busy as you can.  You get the tears and the middle of the night is the worst but take every offer of help there is. The worst part as Jane says is before the treatment begins after that there is always something to focus on. Good luck with everything. S xx",

      "Content": "Hi Is it normal to have lumps appearing under a lumpectomy scar. I had my op in July and finished radiotherapy at the end of October this year. No chemo. I am not sure if this lump has always been there since I had the op or if it has appeared recently....... I didn't have a lump originally - I had invasive lobular cancer and was diagnosed following a mammogram. The lump is at one end of the scar. I will ring my BCN in the morning but wondered if lumps appeared as a result of the operation............... or not usually. Many thanks Sandi",

      "Content": "Hi I had to request my pathology report after reading that other people had theirs on this site. My BC nurse told me she would have to ask if I could have it.  It was then handed to me at my first meeting with the radiotherapy Consultant who just handed it to me as he left our meeting. It wasn't discussed with me and I spent a very busy (and quite worrying) evening googling every phrase in the Report. I still am unsure on some of the phrases in it but feel it would have been better to have been discussed fully in a meeting and explained clearly to me. Hope you get all the info you want and its fully explained to you. Take care...Sandi x",
