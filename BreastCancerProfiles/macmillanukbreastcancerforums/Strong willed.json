      "Content": "Hi, I too want my 'good' boob removed. I had surgery first and am now half way through chemo. I did askmy surgeon if she would remove my good side and she said yes ifi insisted however she would rather I waited for the to e of recon as it would give me more options. I now regret not pushing for a double mx. I would rather have none than one and even with my prosthesis, which is great, due to my remaining boob being a DD/E my upper chest area is flatter on my mx side than my remaining side, I hadn't really realised how far up my breast tissue went! Anyway, after my RT in February I am hopimg to see my surgeon again and ask her to remove my remaining boob, I'm happy to wait longer for recon but I NEED it gone ASAP! I hate it! Xxx",

I was diagnosed at 31 and had no strong family history, closest relative to have breast cancer was my great grandmother. I can't offer you any advice or experience on the IVF but wanted to say that it's great they are getting your eggs removed before you start treatment. They'll be ready and waiting for you when you are ready! Are you having any hormonal treatment afterwards which may delay IVF? Best wishes for your treatment, Hayley X P.s. there's a private Facebook page for under 40's with BC, there's about 300 of us on it, if you search for 'younger breast cancer network (uk) secret group' there is probably someone on there who can offer you advice and experience.

You didn't choose to have to wear a wig and for me the loss of control is a major issue in this battle with cancer.

Pathology has discovered that I had zero lymph node involvement and 6mm margins from the closest cancerous area, I had 4 very small areas. The MRI 'confirmed' that the 2nd lump which could be felt was in the lymph node but that was wrong! I am SO relieved! My cancer was grade 3 so I will still be having chemo, rads, herceptin and tamoxifen. I'm quite happy that I am having chemo, makes me feel like everything possible is being done to put all this behind me, putting the follow ups aside! Chemo should start in 2-3wks, I've to have a muga scan next week. Lots of love xxxx",

I'm even quite looking forward to starting chemo afterwards and hope I can fit in all 6 before Christmas... I'd have to start 4 weeks post op to finish in December. My children seem more excited about having sleepovers rather than worried about me going to hospital so that's one less worry. They're 5 and 3 so a bit young to process any more than \"I'm having a little operation\" my 5 year old didn't even ask why! It's been great reading all your positive stories about your surgery and how the pain afterwards seems fairly minimal. Speak to you all next week when I get back home. Lots of love X",

I have a family friend who used the cold cap and regretted it. My main reasons were the fact that even though i would have my own hair i wouldnt be able to style it as i usually do therefore I wouldn't ever be happy with it, it also prolongs your time in the chemo ward and can be extremely uncomfortably cold! I have my wig fitting on Tuesday. Good luck with your decision! X",

I dont want to add to your worry but I was diagnosed and the age of 31 in June of this year, small lump found myself at the front top of my breast and another small further lump was discovered after an ultrasound. I was initially sent away for a month to try anti inflammatory cream and evening primrose oil, I went back a month later with no change and was sent up to the hospital, albeit another month later! While on the ward after my surgery I met a 26 year old who had initially found a lump under her arm and was also sent away from her GP several times being told it was nothing to worry about. I think it has to be our age that makes them presume it's not cancer, but it can be. Good luck, I really hope it is nothing but if you go to a breast clinical least they could do a fine needle aspiration and check the cells, they did this on my lumps.",

I am so so grateful I have such a supportive husband and family and friends desperate to support and help in every way they can. Also feel very lucky to have had my 2 beautiful daughters and not have the stress of fertility decisions before chemo. Does anyone have the same cancer as me - was just curious as to the chemo cocktail than is usually used after surgery? Just curious, I know every case is different. I also have PCOS and although my consultant says its not connected I am struggling to understand how it can't be when it's oestrogen responsive...! I want my ovaries removed at some stage in the near future. Looking forward to getting to know you all in our journeys and seeing us all cross the finish line :) Xxx",

It's a week tomorrow until my operation, wish it was tomorrow! I'm strangely looking forward to the chemo, I know there's a good chance it'll be pretty awful but at least I'll be doing something! Lots of love to you all X",

I already used bare minerals make up which is paraben free however I have changed my face wash, creams, body wash and body cream to Origins. The lady at their counter in John lewis was so helpful and not on a big sell. Just curious if I'm in the majority of the anti parabens! I know there's no proven link however there are studies which have shown that most breast cancers contain parabens, I'm willing to do anything to help! I was amazed to discover that brands such as Simple, body shop, Liz Earl etc contained parabens!!!",

Any nail varnish brands that are good for us to use??? I've ordered Suncoat nail varnish remover however the actual nail varnishes all seem to have something in them that we 'shouldnt' use, argh! X",

I received the natural aqueous cream from Shea by nature, it's lovely and does feel so much nicer than what I got on prescription. Think I was about Â£12 for a tub but it will last months! I also ordered some ZOYA nail varnishes - Zoya nail polishes are FREE of formaldehyde, Toluene, Dibutyl Phthalate, Camphor and Vegan Friendy, AND they apparently last on natural nails up to seven/ten days! I've only had mine on for 3 days but I can honestly say there is not one chip yet and I would have always had some chips by now from no7 or rimmel! Xx",

      "Content": "Hi, I had a left mx and LNC on 2nd Aug, just over 5 weeks ago. My breast nurse advised me to get a front fastening bra and I'm so glad I did, my shoulder was quite stiff initially and with the drains also coming out right where a bra sits I had a bit more control over where it was placed! I found a post surgery bra made my Anita online - Anita does a lot of mastectomy bras. My drains were the painful part for me, the stitch which held them in seemed very tight and if I twisted the wrong way the pain was incredible albeit just for a few seconds. I had absolutely no bruising and my scar is incredibly neat. I had google imaged mastectomies so I knew what to expect. My first drain was removed on day 3 and my second was day 7. The hospital gave us a bag to carry the drains in however once I was home I used one of my own! I was first to theatre on the Thursday however I styed in hospital until the Saturday morning. I was pretty knackered until Friday lunchtime and as I have 2 small kids at home I thought a second night was of benefit to my recovery... I was desperate to et it by the saturday though! Best of luck, I'm sure you'll be fine. Lots of love xx",

I know it's easier said than done but please try to limit the worrying (and googling!) until you actually have actual facts from your results. I was initially told that one of my two small lumps was an auxiliary node, I was devastated and when results dy post surgery (mx and LNC) was approaching I was beside myself with dread about how many lymph nodes were involved.... Turns out NONE! Pathology came back with clear margins and no lymph involvement, I was so relieved but also very upset that for weeks I had believed it had spread outwith my breast tissue. Nothing is certain until after surgery. Some lumps are bigger and some are actually smaller. Good luck on Friday, the biopsys are unpleasant but bearable. Mine were done in mammography, you'll be well looked after I'm sure. Xxx",

I was kept fairly private with my stylist who was lovely and at no point did I feel rushed into decision making. I had long dark thick hair and now have a choppy bob until it comes out :( I can take my wig in and it will be personalised free of charge and my stylist also said he would buzz my head when I've decided the time has come for it all to go - I plan to get my husband to do this but thought e offer was nice and he said they have a private room for that.
