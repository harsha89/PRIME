      "Content": "Hope someone can help me!  Had DCIS in 2005 and radiotherapy, then a new cancer in same breast in 2009 Invasive Lobular - had mastectomy and chemo followed by Tamoxifen.  Then in 2011 had prophylactic mastectomy and the LD flap reconstruction on the cancer breast and simple implant on the right one.  However when I went for my nipple reconstruction follow up appointment I found a hard lump at the bottom ridge of my left breast.  I mentioned this to my consultant who said she wants me to have a guided biopsy and scan which is on Monday.  I'm worried sick and can't think straight.  I just can't bear the thoughts of it being cancer again.  Has anyone had or know of anyone with a similar situation?  Many thanks, Kristina",

      "Content": "I recently had both nipples reconstructed and for the first week I had to wear a dressing and padding over the nipples. Last week I had padding removed and now have dressings with the middle cut out to expose the nipples. I have to do this for six weeks and wear a bra with middles cut out. What I'm wondering is when will I be able to lie on the area, I'm not sleeping well on my back and I'm frightened I will roll on them and cause damage, Any advice would be appreciated. Many thanks",
