      "Content": "Hi GJP I had a mastectomy  & lymph nodes removed last July and started chemo in November, they discovered my cancer had turned to grade 3 during an oncotype dx test. I changed a lot of my products to non perfumed and did quite a bit of research.  Aveeno for moisturiser  but now I'm on Docetaxel I'm using udderly cream with extra urea, particularly on hands & feet, pitrok crystal roll on deodorant for women, made from pure natural  mineral salts, Jennifer Young Defiant Beauty Nail oil. Also, I changed to aloe dent toothpaste along with a soft brush. My oncologist has prescribed me various mouthwashes due to sore mouth on FEC.  Wishing you all the best on your recovery",
