The opinions as well as researches are equally deivided ....so what you have done? The confusions around so many things is so upsetting.... Gabes",

      "Content": "Thanks for your information. Nobody seems to hear about Teva's Latrozole. I'm having a go. The legs aches started before I started TEVA,,so I have no clue why and what's the reason for it...maybe a kind of cold symptoms (that's very optimistic view!) .. i have checked the price of Femara in Poland (the country of my roots) and there fully paid Femara Novartis costs only 52£! I'll see how am I coping on the Teva stuff and if not I will investigate how and what could be done to have Femara. This of course would be depended on Brexit results. If we out I'm afraid not much could be then done.  Keep in touch. I will let you know. best regards and pinky hugs  Gabes",

Hope it is only Letrozole side effects! This Accord issue is a news to me but it looks that something has changed. Yesterday my Boots gave me Letrozole by TEVA!? Never heard that they produce it, I thought they did tamoxifen only. I took my first tablet today. Hope won't be too bad. best regards and hugs to all Gabes",
