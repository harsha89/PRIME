I was using e45 but it was not helping so went to the doc she advised me to stop using simple soap as it causes your skin to go dry. I was prescribed hydrocortisone cream and a 3 in 1 very thick ointment that you showered moisturized etc within a few days the rash started to calm down get your self to the docs good luck",

I've been off work since the beginning of the year I've had my operation and have just started radiotherapy. I get regular sickness meetings with my employers but mentally I just could not return to work. I'm a strong positive person but after reading some of the lovely ladies posts I think I must be weak. Just remember ladies this is one of those times in your life when you must look after your selfs good luck to you all and take care",
