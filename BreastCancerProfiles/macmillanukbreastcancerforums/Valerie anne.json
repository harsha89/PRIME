      "Content": "Having finished my radiotherapy in Nov 2014, I had every side effect going from the 2nd week after it finished. I have been increasing my exercises gradually, then last week I started wheezing, while exercising. So phoned the G.P who gave me a ventolin inhaler. It worked for 2 days but then the wheezing returned. The G.P then gave me the brown inhaler which is a preventive. I just wondered if anyone else has had this experience.? Thanks Valerie-anne",

      "Content": "Hi G n J Yes you are right.  They are helping. Seem to be using the brown one more ( morning and evening), but I have the blue one to use should I need to.  I will be testing them properly tomorrow, when I do my weekly mile walk. If I am ok tomorrow I will be using the brown inhaler still but only 1 puff instead of 2. G.P has told me to only use these inhalers for another month, which is fine by me. But we shall wait and see. Got to get it sorted as I go back to work on 17th March. I already have a sore throat and was wondering if it was the inhalers, thank you for helping me put my mind at ease with that. Onward and upward, keep going is the motto. I,ve got everything crossed they work,  and I can get moving without them. Thanks again you lovely two. Love and hugs V-A xxxx ",

      "Content": "Hi Everyone Having had a water pipe burst under the floor in my kitchen, now have had no water or anything to cook on in the four walls which is all that is left of the kitchen. Trying to cope with microwave and barbecue, wrong time of year for the latter, Now 6 weeks on the drying machines are driving me mad, it's like having a tumble dryer and boiling kettle by 10 24/7, such fun. Hopefully the dryers have dried it all out and might be finished by Monday, Whopee. On September 5th, despite not liking heights I climbed the roof of the O2. It was fantastic. Had I not had cancer I would have never had this chance. Look out wing walking here I come. After a year away from work I am  back next week . A phased return, slow but sure as my fatigue will not take a holiday or the hint and go away. keep going is the motto. Having a day over my friends today to get away from the noise and celebrating going back to work. Big hugs to everyone Valerie-Annexxxxxxxxxxxx",

      "Content": "Hi I am on letrozole 2.5mg 1 a day. Started them in September 2014 and between then and a few weeks ago I have put on 6kg. At only 5ft and now 79KG I am a bit on the heavy side, but waddling well.lol Trying to get out to get some exercise, as my energy levels allow and depression too. Has anyone else had weight gain, on these tablets? I know I am not on my own. Just want to get some sort of exercise that I can keep going at. Never been a gym bunny, but love swimming, if I try to go for a swim at the moment as I get in the water will get out. Has anyone got any tips or sayings that have helped them through this time? Would love to hear them as I still have my sense of humour, just. Thank you in advance. love and hugs Valerie-anne xx  ",
