      "Content": "Hello ladies. Please to meet you. I was diagnosed with triple negative breast cancer  hello ladies. Please to meet you. I was diagnosed with triple negative breast cancer in November and had a lump ectomy and sentinel node biopsy  in December. I am due to start FEC-T on January 8. Feeling okay about it all at the moment just trying to decide what to do about my hair.   Up till now I've been saying that I want to shave it all off but the closer it gets the more worried I get but I'm even more worried about watching it fall out every day. I have very long thick curly brown hair and I wanted to donate it to a charity so that another little girl could benefit from it.   What would be really really good is any tips that anyone can give about how to cope with side-effects or help reduce side-effects. I heard something about wearing dark nail varnish?  Also are there any good Facebook groups that you know off please?  Keep going ladies  Xxxx",

      "Content": " Ladies thank you so much for your replies. Decision made. I am having my hair cut into a pixie type Bob next week and my hair will go to the little princess trust.   I feel much better now having made a decision so next job is wig shopping. I'm also thinking about holding a charity event to raise money for breast cancer so I can start that project now as well.  Did I see that there was a page where everybody had posted tips about chemo? Sorry if that was on one of the replies. I was trying to explain to my three-year-old this morning  about my hair being cut and he told me I would be just like Rapunzel in tangled and asked me if I would still have magic powers. Lol.  There is nothing like the joy of children to remind you  how lucky we are to just be here. Have a good day ladies. Looking forward to getting to know you. Xxx",
