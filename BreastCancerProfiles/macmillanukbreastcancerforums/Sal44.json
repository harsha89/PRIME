      "Content": "Hi Loufil. I'm sorry you find yourself in this worrying situation. It's not pleasant and like the rest, I sincerely hope your stay on this site is brief. I'm 25 and was diagnosed in July last year. Like you, through self-examination I noticed a lump in my breast. I say lump but it was actually more like a thickening that didn't feel right. I was referred to the breast clinic on the Saturday, had ultrasound and biopsies and an appointment was made there and then for the following Wednesday for results. I was told on the saturday that I have two lumps and one of them is showing unbenign features (the non cancerous one believe it or not!) I still never thought I would have cancer at the age of 25 with no history whatsoever in my family. Looking back, I think they knew there and then on the biopsy day that I had cancer.  My whole world fell apart. I was planning on buying a house and having children with my long term partner when actually my life came to a standstill.  The priority in my case was freezing eggs (this sadly did not work) Then I went on to have chemo and I'm currently recovering from a lumpectomy. Radiotherapy will start soon.  I hope me sharing my experience has not worried you but I want to give you an insight into my experience as a 25 year old.  Im praying that Wednesday brings you good news, I really am. However if on the other hand you are given the worst news, I can honestly say that it is doable with the right attitude. Obviously every BC case is different with varying grades and stages (I still don't understand these terminologies) but positivity is key.  Please keep us posted and I'm here if you have any questions. You can add me as a friend on here somehow.  The very best of luck to you for Wednesday.  S x",

      "Content": "Hi all, Has anyone had any experience with stopping tamoxifen to have children? I don't know if it's at all possible, haven't really spoke to my team about it as I thought it's more important to have me here first before I think about children.  I'm 25 and started tamoxifen in Feb. It's going well really, no major side effects. However, I'm on this drug for ten years. I wanted children before 35 preferably. I had fertility treatment before chemo but none of my embryos survived so I'm really eager to know if I can have children or not as I have nothing to fall back on.  On the other hand, part of me is thinking I am being selfish to have children in case it returns and I am not so lucky in survival? Can anyone shed some light/experience on this matter?  Thank you Sx ",

It's a tough decision but I am on agreement with not living by 'what ifs'. Will let you know how I get on. Hopefully will get an appointment soon! Best wishes xx",

      "Content": "Hi Emma, Sorry I haven't logged on for a while!  Once I got into the swing of tamoxifen, and got two more baby nephews, I decided that I'll plod on for the time being and not think about children haha! I am, of course, still eager to know, but I've only been on tamoxifen for a year and half, I think I'll wait a bit more. How is your process looking within the three months since you've posted?  Sal x",
