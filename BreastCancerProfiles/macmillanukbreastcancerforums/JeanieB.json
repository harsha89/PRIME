I was always a 'doer' but had to retrain myself to be a 'sitter'. It's not for ever so don't worry. I'm 3 months post chemo and 6 weeks post radiotherapy and am about 75% back to normal. I do find though that I don't feel the need to run round like a blue arsed fly like I did before. I'm much more laid back about life. Life now is precious and to be enjoyed! ",

Big mistake, I had a houseful on Christmas Day and again on Boxing Day and today I'm doing a Caribbean party for my friends birthday. I'm smiling through it all but inside I'm thinking 'whatever possessed me to think I could do all this???'  if you are still having radiotherapy then you can expect to feel tired for a while to come yet but it will get better. If you can stay off work for a few more weeks you should. You shouldn't feel guilty, it's necessary for your body to recover properly, I realise that now when I tried to be mother Christmas and struggled.",

However that aside I am much more concerned that I also seem to have now got some cording. Just one really thick one going from axillary down my inner arm. BN says to massage it and stretch and at some stage it will pop and be ok. Anyone else had cording and any recommendations to cure it or at least make it a bit less painful?",

I should definitely have delayed the celebrations as by day 4 following the last Taxotere I was in hospital yet again with a high temperature. 3 days later my neutrophils dropped to 0.1 and stubbornly stayed there for 4 days before slowly starting to rise. I was finally allowed home after 11 days in hospital when my neuts got to 1.2. Feel as weak as a kitten, lost 5lb in weight while in hospital (quite pleased about that bit) but hopefully out the other end now. I've got my seroma surgery next week so have to spend this week trying to build up my strength. Hopefully it won't be delayed as I really want to push on with everything and get to the radiotherapy stage.",

I bought loads of scarves and always matched them to my outfit, using sparkly hijab caps underneath to add a bit of glamour. I also used any glitzy elasticated bracelets I had to wrap round the dangly bit of scarf. I got far more complements on my headgear than I ever did for my hair! Don't get me wrong, I still scare the life out of myself when I look in the bathroom mirror in the morning. I'm a redhead so now that my hair is starting to grow I look like a well worn teddy bear, not ready for public viewing for a few more months yet. I have 3 wigs that I alternate and tend to wear them rather than the scarves now that my treatment has finished and also now the weather is colder (wigs were too hot in the summer) Have you got access to a Headstrong course near you? This was very helpful as they show you different ways to tie scarves and also advise on wigs. Don't be afraid to have a good cry but then get that headgear on and put on a fantastic show for your public!! You can do it!",

On day 1 of chemo you will have three drugs F- Fluorouacil E- Epiribicin C-Cyclophosphamide Three weeks later you have exactly the same, then again three weeks later then move to the Taxotere  for three cycles. They usually give me about 8 tablets to take before starting which are a mix of anti-sickness drugs. You also get a huge bagful of drugs to take home. It's a bit confusing at first but when I got them I wrote on each box exactly how many to take and when to take them. You will probably also get Filgrastim injections to do at home. Bit scary injecting yourself the first time but it be honest you can't even feel it! The E bit makes your wee pink so don't worry, it's normal. As for side effects everyone is different. I felt slightly queasy for the first week but it didn't stop me eating, just ate my meals but no snacks or alcohol which isn't a bad thing. I did have other issues but won't bore you with the details, just remember everyone us different and you may sail through with nothing. All of it is manageable! Tiredness is a given I think and does get worse each cycle. You can be vulnerable to infection so make sure you take your temp twice a day and call triage if it goes over 37.5. You do have to take this very seriously. I got a good telling off from my oncologist for suggesting I was wasting NHS resources by going to A&E so often. The one time you might ignore the temp is the one time you can end up with sepsis ( don't want to scare you but this is a legitimate scare point) You've got to be in it to win it so the sooner you start the sooner it will be over and you can get on with your life. Good luck.",

By the third dose I didn't get any 'good' days at all, just constant bad stuff - aches, debilitating fatigue, mouth like a dead ferret had taken residence, constipation. I spent 32 nights in hospital overall. So that's all the bad stuff. The good news is that it's all temporary! 4 months post chemo and 2 months post radiotherapy I'm feeling pretty much ok and the bad stuff is just a memory. I got through it all and am here to tell the tale. You'll get through it too and whatever you have to put up with its getting rid of the cancer so worth a few months of shit!",
