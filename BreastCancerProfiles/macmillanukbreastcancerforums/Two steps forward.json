      "Content": "I think it was so unrealistic as to be almost damaging. See a later post in this thread from someone who felt weak in comparison and had to aspire to be strong like this character..and not burden her family with her emotions.. the only part for me that rang true was the character in tears after her diagnosis ...but then of course some nice man she'd only just met came to sit with her in the car. Yeah right. The programme couldn't decide if it was comedy or drama. I know cancer will be difficult to portray on telly ... Coronation Street in my opinion is making a better job of it.",

      "Content": "Hi Emaline. You're right it was just a programme and quite unrealistic. The character sailed through the experience. Do you watch Coronation Street? The portrayal of Sinead's cancer is a lot nearer the mark and recently a nurse advises her to lean on her family and friends. They are there to support you. You don't need to aspire to be like anyone else and you don't need to be strong or always keep a lid on your emotions. You will already be feeling exhausted and bottling everything up won't help. As one friend said to me there's no gold star for how you get through this. This is a time when friends and family can really support you...be kind to yourself. You are not a burden! You are going through a terrifying and isolating experience but in my view finding support from other people is essential. The people who love you and care about you will want to be there for you xx",
