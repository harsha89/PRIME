    "Content": "I would also recomend a picc line,my veins are rubbish and it was a hassle trying to get cannulas in for blood and chemo. only drawback is i cant swim. i got a cover for it from a firm called limbo to keep it dry in the shower for about 13.00 pounds and the procedure to have the picc line put in was quick and painless. the district nurse comes once a week to flush it through and change the dressing.
