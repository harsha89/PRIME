      "Content": "Hiya, Pain and movement does seem to change from day to day, you never know, Some days are better than others. I have learnt to finally accept that and it might just be a bad day not even related to the cancer. I had an lumpectomy and auxiliary clearance in 2011 for which they had found already  had spread to the lymph nodes. I was given some arm exercises by the Physio to stop my arm seizing up. it was not until much later that I found out my neighbours had been watching ne do my exercises and they thought I was an odd ball, At least I gave them something to laugh about. Don't push yourself too much. You might feel like you can do it all and you going to hit all the targets you set that day and when  you miss one you feel like a failure, DONT It can also affect how you feel the next day. I had my first chemo weekly in 2912, I was good on the Friday when I had chemo not say by Saturday afternoon. All I wanted to do was sleep on Saturday and I slept for 24 hours straight, After that I was fine \"well within reason\"",

      "Content": "I am sorry to hear that you have been diagnosed with two separate breast cncers in each breast. I was first diagnosed in 2011 with breast csancer in my left breast. I had no one to really talk about this with but I quickly learnt that we are individuals and ad such we will react differently so any advice you receeivve, try and if it does not work DONT blame yourself. Anyway when I was diagnosed they found another type of the breat cancer in the same breast. I also found out the cancer had spred to my lymph nodes and bones. However, I refused to give up but just wish I had known about this site or had somethng to reaad like this I would have been grateful even for some of the funny comments I wish you all the best There is a struggle on which words to use and iI am sorry about your diagnosis xxx",

      "Content": "I got sick of trying to respond on my tablet and making a whole lot of mistakes and really about to explode so I have moved over to the main computer and will try again. Since I have been away thee have been a number of posts but I wanted to addy bits because these cures/remedies do relay make me mad. I was diagnosed with Breast Cancer in Oct 2011 and by the end it had moved to my bones. My local postie talked about some water based miracle cure, while another friend sent me a newspaper article telling me if I gave up all dairy products and I would be cancer fee. What a joke!!!!! Now I was wanting to make an informed decision based on fact not fiction and that is why I like this site, it provides so much information and where I need to go if I want more information. Now when I told my in-laws that the cancer had spread into my bones, they thought it meant I had another type of caner and stared to look up information about bone cancer rather than secondaries to the breast and I think that really scared them. I had to try and explain it to them bur I still don't think they understand it today. It did not help that I was taken to the hospital wtth very bad back pain \"Sciatica \" without  being examined( I was told quite clearly, without having any tests that the back pain had nothing to do with the breast cancer and was pulled off of the bed, given a prescription and to stop wasting time. If they could only see me now..",
