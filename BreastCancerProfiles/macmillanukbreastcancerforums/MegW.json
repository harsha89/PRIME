And is there really only one reply after more than 10 hours? I am very disappoined with that. Can somebody please let me know what I am doing wrong? It keeps asking me to log in. I just want to view any replies to my post, I am going gaga with it. I need some help. Margaret",

      "Content": "I think I'm getting the hang of it! I agree that it isn't sensible for others to put their life on hold as such, but I just thought that during these early days my daughter and her hubby should be around as much as they can be, rather than appearing to be behaving as if nothing was happening in the family.  The family is quite small, only one uncle, no cousins, and two very elderly grannies who need a lot of attention, as well as them coping with their daughter's cancer. I suppose we are looking for a balance between accepting the seriousness of the situation but remaining as hopeful as possible. Obviously, the sister-in-law is up and down with her feelings, which affects everyone else too, and my daughter feels she is the person who can \"hold them together\" - but perhaps she is expecting too much of herself. Just thinking aloud really, I know there are lots of you going through the same. Thanks everyone Meg    ",

      "Content": "Hi, I'm new here. 2009 should have been the happiest year ever for daughter's new in-laws. Both their daughter and son were getting married to wonderful partners. The daughter married first on a beautiful June day and just 2 months later was diagnosed with breast cancer. The family managed wonderfully to hide their stress and their son and our daughter also had a beautiful wedding day. But now reality is here, with chemo underway to reduce the tumour prior to surgery, hair loss, the possibility of infertility and even if fertile, a long wait before having children. I'm pretty sure there is no standard way for families to react to something like this. I have only met them a few times, but it is clear that they are very close and loving. My daughter is, of course, the least \"connected\" emotionally, and she is by nature a very pragmatic person, trying to be positive and supportive. Her new husband is increasingly upset by his sister's distress, as are his parents, and everyone is finding it hard to keep their tempers with one another. Prior to the diagnosis, my daughter and her then fiance had pre-planned a busy and exciting next few months - a holiday, house-hunting, visiting friends and family across the country, and she is now feeling guilty at trying to go ahead with these plans when the family is going through the mill. I'm sure there's no single answer, but do others feel they should put some of these plans on hold for a while? And how can my daughter appear to be being positive when everyone else is so worried and upset? Or should she perhaps not appear so positive and be more empathetic? Meg",
