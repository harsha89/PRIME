    "Content": "Hi Mandy, I was diagnosed early sept and a mastectomy was planned but as it was present in my sentinel nodes I am having chemo first . my third cycle is due this thursday. I didn't actually notice any lumps but like you i had pain, a stabbing pain , thankfully I did eventually get some relief as they thought that one of the lumps was pressing on a nerve. anyway I know what u mean about waiting , i think most people on here will agree thats its one of the hardest things.I did have a sense of relief when my chest/abdo scan came back ok and it was then that i strtd to think ok well lets just get on with it . like u i was very keen to have the surgery first just to feel it was gone but as things happen and it had spread to the nodes that option was taken out of my hands, so it will have to wait untill after the chemo. I did also feel better once the pain had gone as that was just a constant reminder every morning when i woke up. I have just turned 45 and have 2 kids .I too try to stay strong but we all have those days when its just not that easy. I have 2 kids so I need to stay as normal as possible for them . take care amanda x",
