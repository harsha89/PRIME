      "Content": "I joined this wonderful site about a month ago and subscribe to the BC forum, but have not come across my situation and wondered if someone has gone through this treatment. I was diagnosed with DCIS and have had a skin saving Mast + LD flap (back muscle) + saline implant (2 weeks post op) and now told I may need Radiotherapy but my research suggests that this is very very unusual and not to mention that Rads can also play havoc with the final look of the breast \u2013 I will not know until next week if I need Rads and am in two minds about it \u2013 but wondered if anyone else had this experience and what the outcome was? Thank you for reading.",
