      "Content": "I found the Tax much harder like everyone else no sickness but Day 3 onwards pains in joints - maybe made worse by the Zarzio though. Mouth is the worst for me. I did get an infection after the first cycle and had to be hospitalised. My legs feel heavy as well. Mouth very dry and furry. I use gel Clair which they prescribed which I do find helped a lot I also use a dilutes myrrh mouthwash once or twice a day which I buy from Neals Yard as a tincture and dilute with water. I had head and neck cancer 8 years ago and found the myrrh very good then. Just feel wiped out and tired most of the time and it seems to last a lot longer -at least a week or more whereas it only lasted about 5 days with the FEC. Also feet and toes quite numb with lots of dry skin. My face also turned red but I used Aveeno lotion on that which was soothing ",

Because I had cancer previously I had to have a body scan so I have spent a very worried two weeks waiting for the result of that however last night I received a call from the consultant to say that the scan was clear. This was great news and now I have got my mojo back and ready to fight this demon again.I am going to have chemo first for eighteen weeks then if all goes to plan a lumpectomy then RT then tablets for 5 years. Thats the plan anyway. I am so glad to meet you all and be part of this group and look forward to all the advice and help to get me through the chemo.",

I have been given dexamethasone to take twice daily for 3 days and Metoclopramide to take three times a day. This is different than the ones I had when I last had chemo then it was Domperinon or something that sounded like champagne but obviously wasn't . They seem to be working OK but wear off about 5 am. Any thoughts or advice welcome. Also having daily injection for immunity. Realised I have a bit of a foggy brain and can't remember everything ",

      "Content": "Thanks Vonnie and mizz 59 it was really good to get your posts in my box as I have been feeling a bit down. My first FEC was last Friday so I guess that means I am on day Day 7 or 6 depending on which day you count as Day 1. First three days were Ok, I also took three days of Dex which finished on Monday. Yesterday and today I have probably been feeling quite lightheaded and a bit like I have bricks on my head. if I move too quickly I can be a bit dizzy. yesterday I was very tired and was in and out of sleep most of the day. I am still having a bit of nausea which I am managing with Metroclompramide and drinking ginger ale. I have checked my temperature and its normal. My mouth is sore but following my Head and Neck cancer I do have to wear a denture in my mouth and it is clearly not helping. I had my hair cut very short on Monday there are few itches but nothing much as yet. I have been driving but not very far literally just down the road to the supermarket not sure if I should really risk it too much. I am finding it really helpful to hear whats going on with everyone else and to hear the feedback from those of you have already been here. so Thanks.",

I have successfully survived that however the scare of cancer and all I went through the first time has had the effect of stopping me from examining other parts of my body and now I have a breast lump. I dont know how long it has been there and I am petrified that it has been there a long time and could have spread so much it is untreatable. This week I went to the hospital and they did a cone biopsy and I get the results next Thursday. They couldnt say for certain what it was until they get the tests back but having been here once I am scared and cant believe I can get cancer twice. I would just be grateful for any words of support at the moment. I have had huge support from this community for my first cancer. I know I am thinking the worst but I watched it all on the ultrasound and it looked awful.",

It wasn't easy as I still have a dry mouth due to the RT with my previous cancer so I was convinced that my throat would get really dry and I would need water but I didn't. I have the CT scan next week I am scaring myself because I am imagining the worse. The consultant rang me on Thursday two days after the MRI and said they are going ahead with the original plan of chemo first. The one thing she did say which I could do with hearing about was that she would need to see me before starting chemo to put a clip into the lump so that she could mark where it is in case it disappeared during the chemo. I have got the oncology appointment yet but should getbthisvwithin a week. I also have a further appointment on 28 th with consultant. Trying to stay calm but it's all very difficult. Nina",
