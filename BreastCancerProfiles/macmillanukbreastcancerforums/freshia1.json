Carolyn - I am 57 and have an implant that's not a bad shape and matches the other side even better now that I have had an 'uplift' on the good side, I think it is the success of that has made me consider the nipple reconstruction (on the NHS - but not everywhere it seems) Hevbojangles it's encouraging to hear yours is going well - please let me know how it progresses.",

Time is going quickly and that's good. I get the feeling that the second 3 rounds of chemo with the change of drugs (T) will be a bit like starting all over again. Is that the experience of others? Good wishes to all Carol x",

      "Content": "Hi, I had my last FEC yesterday and although I feel pretty grotty today and for the next week or so, I have found it manageable and know that I will have a good 10-14days before very long. I do feel a bit apprehensive about the 3 Ts that will follow though so any tips welcomed..it seems you need to keep a much closer eye on your temperature, is that right? Also, yesterday they had a little trouble finding a vein (I only have right arm option as the left can't be used due to mastectomy and lymph node removal. PIC line was mentioned, but I hope I haven't got to go down that route, any thoughts? On a positive note - my son got his A Level results today - A* A* A - hooray!! ( I know it's acceptable to have a proud mum moment here, when we all have lots of less happy things to deal with!!) Take care all Carol x",

Went out for pizza to celebrate A levels yesterday - not bad on day 2 post=FEC! Hope that's an encouraging thought for you and you approach your FECs Carol x",

      "Content": "Hi All, Thanks for setting up August Chemo Club. I started chemo on 2nd July and have had 2 rounds. Was feeling low last week, but now I'm picking up on Day 10 post chemo 2 and feel like myself again. So I'm encouraged that this can happen. Getting used to hair loss a bit now to - was really fed up about it last week. Also find drinking loads difficult...water can taste horrid post chemo - so I tried lime cordial in sparkling mineral water which was a bit more drinkable. I'm now having a week by the sea with the whole family so feeling like this might all be manageable - planning a few treats for the good days is a good way to go. Good luck to all Carol x",
