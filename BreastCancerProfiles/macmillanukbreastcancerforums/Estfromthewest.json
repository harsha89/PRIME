    "Content": "Hello hillwalker I have struggled with the hair loss too. It was ok in the winter as I wore a Rene of Paris halo hair piece and a hat or bandana. I felt the turban and and scarves were a bit too chemo chic for me. My hair is starting to grow back as I\u2019ve changed chemo drugs so I probably look like you. A bit sinaed o Conner. I almost preferred it bald as its only 8 weeks growth and I feel very unfeminine. Just wanted to suggest a Etsy Company I foundcalled wrapd in love. They do stretchy bandanas which you can cover the whole head with or have a wide headband. I think they are called tribal head wrap. I love them and have had lots of compliments. A good alternative as I sort of roll it under at the back of the head and it\u2019s really flattering . Stops the neck looking so exposed. Much love Est. X",
