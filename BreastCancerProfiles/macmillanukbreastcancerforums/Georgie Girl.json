    "Content": "Hi Ladies. I have just taken my very first Letrozole, after looking at the packet for most of the evening. Have seen the discussions about joint pain and hot flushes and the measures you take to alleviate them (calcium, vit D, magnesium). It gas been an education for me, especially now that I am on the recieving end of treatment (I am an  Oncology nurse). I look forward to all your common sense advice. Take care of your selves.  Gina xx",
