    "Content": "Hi there, As a children's cancer nurse before I was diagnosed at Christmas I had a lot of experience with central IV lines as nearly all of the children had these inserted due their smaller veins and to make things easier and more comfortable for them to undergo therir treatments.The choice of line was often dictated by the length or complexity of their treatment protocols. PICC lines tend to be used for shorter treatments protocols and are not often usable to take blood tests as well. They require a weekly dressing to the site and a flush to keep them from blocking off. As has been said are usually in the arm and can get knocked. Portacaths and Hickman lines can both be used for sampling blood as well as for giving infusions of Chemo and blood products etc Hickman lines lie externally to the body but are usually on the upper chest so less likely to get knocked than PICCs. They need weekly attention to the dressing over it and also to flush it with Saline and Heparin solutions to keep the line patent. You will need either a district nurse or keen family member willing to be taught how to do this for you as they can be a little tricky to see what you are doing for yourself. Portacaths, as have been descibed, lie just under the skin on the chest and these require a needle to access them. They are unobtrusive. You will need someone competent in the access and care of ports as they require special techniques and needles to access and maintain them. The majority of the children I saw with Leukaemia had portacaths inserted as the treatment protocols for some of them lasted over 3 years. Once a needle is in a port with it can be secured with a dressing and left for up to a week at a time so if blood tests are taken and treatment is due a day or two later the IV line is already in place. Needle access into the port is less painful and often quicker than peripheral vein access but you can use a topical anaesthetic cream (EMLA or Ametop) on the skin over the port to numb the area if you wish. Some of the teenagers chose not to use this as they didn't feel they needed it and it took up more of their time! Ports only need monthly flushing with Saline and Heparin solutions to keep them from blocking off so if it is used 3 weekly for treatments it should not require any more intervention between treatments. I hope this has been of some help Good luck S x",
