      "Content": "Hi im 42. recently lost 20 lbs with sw dropped 2 bra sizes and found a lump in my left breast.I saw my gp 2 weeks ago who referred me to the breast unit in my area. I went yesterday had a mammogram then saw a cansultant who told me i had a small concerning lump and i needed a scan. This was done by a different dr. who told me i had a nasty lump 1.2 cm in size and it needed to be removed. she then gave me a local and did a biopcy and then said ill put a tracker bit like gps in the lump ready for surgery. my head was spinning id gone alone thinking id be told it was a cyst or something! I then saw the first consultant again who said its very small and has been caught very early and its 100% treatable he talked about removing it said hed checked under my arm and it was clear...at this point i asked is it cancer? he said the results arent back when i first saw you today i was 50-50 i do this day in day out yes. i was made an appointment to go back in 2 weeks to see him. when i got home i checked the appointment time and date for work reasons and saw it was at the results clinic. so i guess im asking could i still get an all clear and why is there a tracker in my breast?",

      "Content": "thankyou for the reply. I think im doing ok i had resigned myself to the worst the minute i found the lump. The consultant pretty much said the same about slimming world saving my life. i just wish id took someone with me or a pen and paper i keep playing it over in my head. did he say cancer or did i just hear cancer? i just want to get on with treayment like yesterday i have 3 kids at home and am a single mum. and i dont wanna talk myself into being given good new at the next appointment to be told we no actual it is cancer. i think it might be harder that way round!  ",

      "Content": "Hi i had my lumpectomy and sentinel biopcy done just over 3 weeks ago. I got the results back on tuesday just gone my biopcy was clear there was no signs of cancer in my nodes. my surgeon told me it was grade 3 and he has sent it to america to get the % of it coming back this will decide if i will need chemo before radiotherapy. he told me it would be a couple of weeks for the test results id get an appointment to see an oncologist and would be told then what the next treatment would be. I received the appointment to see the oncologist and it is for tuesday the 10th. i have a holiday booked with my 2 girls the last week in may and i have told my concultant about this nack at my first appointment he said he would do the surgery before it...which he has. but now im worried we wont get to go because if my appointment is the 10 i will have had to start treatment before the holiday. long winded post i know but would it be realistic to ask to have the holiday with my 2 daughters before i staet treatment they are so excited it has been booked since before i found the cancer. will it make that much difference to my healtb if so i will cancel the holiday. i just need to know so i know if i have to tell the girls we need to postpone for a while. thank you.",
