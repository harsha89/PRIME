      "Content": "I am sorry you have such fears and are finding it difficult to find an approachable professional to talk to about them.  It is hard to find someone who is willing to give you the time you need to talk and voice your concerns. I recently had a specialist put the fear of god into me about part of my treatment and I made one call to a supposed avenue of help and got fobbed off with bring it up at your next appointment so I gave up and spent four weeks in a state of panic and sleeplessness!  When I attended the set up appointment for the next phase of treatment I voiced my concerns and how frightened I was and the staff were fantastic.  They took time to listen and explained everything and allayed my fears about ongoing treatment. One of the things that has been made clear by all oncology front line staff from the off set is that every aspect of the treatment is tailored specifically to the individual and regular checks are made (heart, lungs, kidneys, liver, bones etc.) to monitor function and any effects treatment may have on you.  A number of the chemotherapy drugs, and herceptin and indeed radiotherapy to a small degree, can have a detrimental effect on the heart which is why we have regular echo-cardiograms.  If at any point those indicate that the heart is being adversely affected, treatment plans will be altered to ensure more imminent risks that could bring about a long term illness / disability are managed effectively.   I have had the opposite concern from you in that I have been more inclined to want to not have anymore treatment after suffering terribly after only 1 round of Docetaxel (after which chemo was stopped completely - I'd had 3 rounds of FEC and 1 Docetaxel) and that'd I'd rather run the risk of cancer returning in the future than continue to be in so much pain and so utterly miserable.  I am continuing with other aspects of the treatment (radiotherapy, herceptin and tamoxifen) even though I have absolutely no desire to keep going at the moment :( It is hard going most certainly, and I do hope that you can talk to someone soon who makes you feel better about the decisions around your treatment, and you find some peace.  Good luck! xxxxxxx",

      "Content": "I am back again with another of my squillion questions, this time pertaining to hair regrowth after chemo..... I lost most of the hair on my head and body after first round of FEC and during the subsequent 2 rounds, however did not lose eyebrows or eyelashes. (Bonus was losing the pesky chin whiskers that had started to appear with age!). However, after my one (and to be only- stopped due to unsavoury reaction to it) round of  Docetaxel, I lost eyelashes and brows. In the following 3 weeks or so after chemo stopped hair started to come back in random places on my body  (in particular, aforementioned pesky chin whiskers Pah), but my head hair has been slow to grow. I have amusing fluffy whiskery hair sprouting but my 'proper' hair is still the same stubble that was there after clippering my hair off on Easter Sunday. On reading stuff about hair regrowth I've gleaned that one should lose the fluff and have 1\" of normal hair 2 months after end of chemo. I am now 7 weeks on and all I have is fluff and no hair. Does anyone know if the info I am reading is piffle and what experience does anyone have of hair coming back? I am getting a tad anxious now.  I am having herceptin and wonder if that may be the issue for non growth? Thanking you in anticipation of enlightenment X ",

Keep drinking lots of water and moisturising and eating healing foods (greens, peppers, cauliflower, chicken, live yoghurt) and all will be well I am sure xxxx",

      "Content": "Oh my, I am crying too, for me, and for you all. I've not long finished RT (last week), had 6th herceptin infusion yesterday (have it at home so I can work from home), and also on tamoxifen. Feel like I'm losing my mind, got awful and painful sores from the RT, and have not had any time off work around treatment (worked from home first week after each chemo and back to work till next round) due to feeling too guilty, and have been doing stupid hours to make up for appointments, and am beyond exhausted.   I find herceptin makes me itch all over and makes my skin crawl for about a week after, can't sleep properly, get anxious and agitated and confused and insides go into meltdown. Am I alone in this? My herceptin nurse said none of these are normal side effects!  I feel your pain about the 'you're so brave' - as you said it's got flip all to do with brave when the choice was do or don't /live or die. I just stuck my head in the sand and motored on blindly following instructions to have treatment.  I hope that you all get to a place where you can manage and balance treatment / side effects / work and recovery from the nightmare! I'm foolishly pinning my hopes on a lottery win and running away to the south of France..... A spinster can dream Healing vibes and best wishes to all x",

I tried my best to stay strong and jolly to get through it all but after final RT I think relief and a certain amount of disbelief of what I'd been through brought about lots of tears, exacerbated fatigue and a sense of hopelessness.  Top that off with all the drugs we still having to take. Hope the worst passes for you soon and you come out the other side smiling and ready for fun and frolics xxx",
