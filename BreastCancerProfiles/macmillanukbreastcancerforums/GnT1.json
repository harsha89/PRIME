    "Content": "Hi, I\u2019m so sorry to be posting on here but I\u2019m really worried that I may also have breast cancer, I see  after reading through a lot of these pages that you are a lovely supportive group and help put peoples mind at ease while going through your own battles.  For 6/7 months I\u2019ve been having pain in my outer right breast that tied in with my monthly cycle but more recently it is a constant sharp pain that has now spread to my nipple. I always check for lumps and never came across any until last week. I recently lost weight and I think that\u2019s why I previously missed the lump. I went to the doctor who had referred me to the breast clinic, I go there on Thursday morning. I just wondered if anyone had similar symptoms to mine? If they tell me I have got Cancer then I will deal with it, it\u2019s this not knowing that is causing stress and sleepless nights. Thank you so much x",
