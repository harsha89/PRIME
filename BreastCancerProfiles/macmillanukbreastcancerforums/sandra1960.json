      "Content": "The people who have told you not to have your chemo in you other arm are correct. You are told when you have your lymph nodes remove that the arm has not got to be used for any injections no bloods to be taken and defeniatly (sp) no iv lines .. I would check yourself with your onc as you do not know if they have checked or not and it is so much better to be on the safe side, if it was me that was in your potition i would def double check if you cannot speak directly to your onc  phone the hospital and ask to speak to his/her secretary and as them to call you back.  Hope this helps ...I had a picc line as i have deep veins and it was almost impossible for them to get a vein, only thing is the picc line damaged my vein so when i do go for blood tests for my Diabetes they have to use one in my upper are and boy it hurts.

      "Content": "Hi I Had breast cancer last may with immediate reconstruction i finished my chemo after 5 sessions as i was going away in sept to turkey for a month. Whilst on holiday i had a turkish bath followed by a massage obviously i had no hair eyebrows or eyelashes and they had been informed i had just finished my chemo. I have never had a massage so good they went gently on my back and around the scar tissue i never thought to ask i just went ahead with it, Hope you get some good news from the Breast care nurse if not try speaking to your oncologist Sandra",

      "Content": "Hi NG Welcome to the forum, Firstly well done in speaking about your Mental Health State, i too suffer from a Mental Health issue i was diagnosed  with Breast  cancer  in april last year. The lymphnodes your mum has had removed are from under her arm , she should have been seen by a physiotherapist and given some advice on how to excersice her arm they are nothing too strenuous and she must do them if she can otherwise she can cause her arm to seize up. If you have any doubts speak to her Breast Care Nurse or call Macmillan they really helpful, continue to post on here as you will find that others will and can contribute more, oh 1 other thing do not hold back the tears if need be cry with your mother it does help relieve the stress .. Best Wishes Sandra",
