      "Content": "Good Afternoon, I was diagnosed in 2013 with DCIS in the right breast and had a lumpectomy and radio therapy. In 2016 it returned in the same breast so I had a mastectomy. Late 2017 I was then diagnosed with Invasive breast cancer in the left breast with 4 areas of cancer, therefore had a second mastectomy. Following Lymph node clearance,  cancer was found in 3 lymph nodes so I am currently undergoing chemotherapy with radio therapy to follow. I saw my oncologist last week and we got talking about the future and Tamoxifen. As I have no breast tissue left I asked if my yearly follow ups would consist of a bone scan and CT scan. To my shock I was advised that apparently the policy (not just at my hospital but all over) is not to carry yearly scans when a double mastectomy has been carried out as apparently they are of no benefit?! The policy is to wait for a patient to present with symptoms of a secondary cancer.  Can anyone confirm if they have had the same experience? Not sure if this scares me more than having scans? Thank  you. X",

      "Content": "Happy Easter Everyone........ I started my treatment of FEC-T on 8th January 2018. I believe compared to some I sailed through the FEC part. I had my first course of Docataxil on 12 March, this wasn't so easy and I suffered some horrendous pains in my head, neck, torso and lower back, 3 weeks on my legs still ache and my hands and feet still 'tingle'. I saw my Oncologist last week and he has now put me weekly Paclitaxel, I am too hoping that this will be a slap with a wet velvet glove rather than a sledge hammer. I will find out on Tuesday when I have the first cycle Catherine",
