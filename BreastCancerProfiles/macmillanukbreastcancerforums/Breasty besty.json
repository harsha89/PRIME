      "Content": "Hello, I\u2019m after some advice and reassurance. Finished treatment (surgery, chemo, radiotherapy) a month ago for HER2+, ER/PR- grade 2 IDC. Had one positive node and primary tumour was 45mm. Having ongoing herceptin until Jan 2020. I\u2019ve had almost constant headaches for the past 1.5 weeks. This is something I\u2019ve never experienced before. It isn\u2019t debilitating - I can still do things - but I feel a bit unwell/nauseous and the constant headaches are getting me down. It\u2019s not due to caffeine/lack of caffeine, dehydration, tiredness or any other cause I can pinpoint. Herceptin was delayed last week due to the headaches and I saw the on-call oncologist on Friday morning. He did a few tests (checked vision etc) and ordered a head CT to be on the safe side, but indicated that there were no worrying signs from his physical examination. (I\u2019m coming to the question now, promise!) The oncologist had no idea when the CT scan would take place (said he requested it happen ASAP). What sort of wait would be typical for the NHS in England? How long after that would I need to wait for results? Is there any benefit in trying to arrange a scan privately? My rational brain tells me it is almost certainly a strange virus or something else equally innocent causing my headaches. However, I can\u2019t seem to get past the anxiety that it is due to brain mets. I know it sounds silly - I feel foolish even writing it down - but I can\u2019t seem to stop worrying about it (which probably isn\u2019t helping the headache)! Any advice or experience with this? Thank you in advance for any and all suggestions!!!",

      "Content": "Thanks Sal! My blood pressure was checked and is a little on the low side but was deemed to be acceptable. I should have added that I\u2019m otherwise fit and well (aged 33). I\u2019m sure you\u2019re right and it\u2019s nothing to worry about. Good luck with your treatment and managing the bone mets!!! Xox",
