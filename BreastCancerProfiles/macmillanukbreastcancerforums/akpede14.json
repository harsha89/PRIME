      "Content": "Hi Terri and everyone else. I have not been on my latop for about 3days now. I went to derby to see a friend and got back yesterday. I am trying to do the things  planned  before now. Just like you Terri my life flashed before my eyes but I am trying to be positive. as a mum you just want to be there for your kids, the slightest tought that something could happen to you is very distressing. YES  its bad that we are in this club but its wonderful that we are here to support each other and the good thing is that you can actually speak to someone who can really understand what you are going through. thanks for your encouragement. If not that the world is a big place, it would have been nice if we could all come together for a drink and give each other a big hug. I do really wish you the best with all your treatment, I known its not something you are looking forward to but its something you want to get over with. thanks ever much and pls let me know how you are getting on. take care love Judith.",

I am one who love my family and work so much and thinking that I might not be ok again is just very distressing. I must tell you that you are a very brave and courageous person. I have gone thru your website and I love the practicality of it. Your story has actually helped me. at least I have gotten out of my bed and stopped crying. I was able to take my 1yr old son out today. thanks judith    ",
