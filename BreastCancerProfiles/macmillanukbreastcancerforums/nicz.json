    "Content": "Hi I too was diagnosed with breast cancer on the 19th of December. Invasive Ductal Grade 3 at that time it was 4cm.  I am also having chemo first, which starts tommorow morning.  I am first having an ultrasound as both myself and onc are aware that tumour has definately grown since dx. I am having FEC-T. Although am having the docetaxol first.   I am very nervous about starting tomorrow but glad to be getting on with it too.  My onc said he prefers to do chemo first to see how the tumour reacts to the chemo and hope mean a smaller op at the end of it. How do yous find the chemo? Any tips? Nicola xx ",
