      "Content": "Hi, reaching out to anyone who can help or give me some advise. Just went through a year getting my body better from breast cancer. Apart from my husband and two kids I never really got any support from my family , even though I'm the youngest of 8 children, I learned to live with that, sometimes people just can't cope with cancer but things have got a lot worse. My mum has now accused me of causing a rift in the family, because I tried to tell them how I was feeling. I've been told to stop acting like a victim and \" you are not the first person to have Cancer\" these are the words of my mother.  I never wanted sympathy during or after my treatment but I really needed their support . Beginning to think ther is maybe something wrong with me , why else don't they want to spend any time with me. Find myself crying all the time, my poor husband has to deal with all my emotion, he gets so angry and when this halogens I find myself defending their actions,especially my mums. I know what he is saying is right but it just hurts to hear it, so now I just try to keep it to myself. Any tips on how to cope with this would be great, I've tried to explain how I feel to my mum but she insists that it's all down to me , beginning to feel that maybe it would have been better if I'd lost the battle with cancer.",

      "Content": "Hi, thank you for your advise, it's made me take a long look at my life within the family and especially my relationship with my mum and if I'm honest she has always been this way with me. Because I never caused any upset or problems I was often overlooked, I've always joked that in a family as large and as loud as mine I was the one who didn't shout loud enough, I just got on being grateful for any bit of attention I could get. I know you're right and that now I need to focus on getting me better but it's hard when I've always put other peoples feelings first but with the love and help of my husband and kids I can do it. . Finding this helps a lot. Xx",

      "Content": "Hi, so glad I came back on the forum, talking to you all is really helping, it's a sad thing to have to say but knowing that other people have had similar experiences has helped me start to think a little clearer. Getting my life back is down to me, I'm beginning to realise that I'll never get any real answers as to why they feel the way they do towards me. Think now that my husband was right when he said that it's down to them to deal with any guilt they have in the way they're behaving,it's not my job to make them feel better about themselves, but it's a hard thing to hear when I've always been so supportive and concerned that I don't upset people. It's hard to change your nature but for my own wee being I'm going to have to try. Xx",

Ive given similar advise to friends in the past, think it's time I took my own advice.  It feels good getting my hurt and frustration out without people judging me.xx",

      "Content": "Thanks Tracey, just hate feeling like this, I've always been the quiet one , always hated confrontation and coming from a large italian family , being so quiet I was easily overlooked. Will maybe try writing letters, don't know if it will do any good but will maybe make me feel better if I get it all off my chest. Have tried talking to my mum but she turns it around and just totally denies that anyone except me has done or said anything wrong, so sad as it it think I have to accept what's happened and close the door and concentrate those people who have been with me from the very start. My Breast care nurse is also going to organise for me to talk to someone, just embarrassed to tell someone that my mum doesn't give a damn. ",

      "Content": "Hi Tracey, yeah I tried to explain that to her. She just didn't get it. She reminded me that 2 of her sisters and my father had cancer, so she knows how it feels. I tried telling her that she doesn't know how it feels, yeah she knows how my husband feels , but she's not willing to listen. You know what it's like, people always know someone else who has had cancer so that makes them an expert on what it feels like to have cancer.  Heading out for another hospital appointment but thanx for replying to my rant, will let you know if I send the letters and what response I get , xxx",

      "Content": "Thanks Helen, your words have hit home, I have an amazing husband and we have raised two fantastic kids. Two wonderful young adults with strong morals and deep love and respect so I know I did good ,with the help of counselling I hope things will get better, just feel sad that this may mean closing the door on my mum and family who just don't want to know. But I suppose deep down I've never felt the bond with my mum that I have with my own daughter. Just makes me sad, that even having cancer didn't seem to mean that much to her. Xx",
