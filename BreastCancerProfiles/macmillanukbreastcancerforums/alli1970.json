      "Content": "Hi Carolyn28,  My goodness you have been through a lot too, this is my fifth implant, other ones were too big and I had capsular contracture so had to be removed quickly. At the moment my nearest hospital doesn't have a breast cancer surgeon so it's pretty difficult to get things going along. I just don't want to have it removed and regret it but I feel at the moment the implant looks terrible Xx",

      "Content": "Hi everybody, I had breast cancer at age of 32, needed a mastectomy with immediate implant. Then 4 years ago it decided to come back in my other breast, this time it was stage 3 so needed lumpectomy, chemo and radiotherapy. Since this I've lost loads of weight and my natural breast has shrunk loads so my implant is a lot bigger. It's also too high and very rippled. I'm now 46 and thinking of having the implant removed and just using a prosthesis any feedback or advice would be fab  Xx",
