    "Content": "Hello I won\u2019t go into a long story but a year ago today I had a mastectomy after finding high grade dcis. I had immediate reconstruction using a permanent expandable implant. All the expansion treatments were so painful and my chest wall painful for weeks following every expansion. I still have terrible pain in my chest, shoulder and armpit which feel like they are still being overstretched. My surgeon has suggested having the implant removed and placed on top of my pectoral muscle to try and relieve some of the pain. Has anyone else experienced anything similar, or had the implant placed on top? My surgeon said if it\u2019s placed on top there is more chance of seeing the outline of the implant and rippling etc.  Thank you ",
