      "Content": "Hi All Just after some advice - had second lot of chemo last Monday.  I was violently sick on the Monday night and since then have been feeling as if I am on a boat most of the time.  I have domperidone but not convinced they are working.  Chemo nurse has suggested something else but can't remember what they were.  It helps if I lay down in a dark room but don't want to do that all the time.  Have also been taking Movicol/Laxidos as previously constipated.  It helps when I eat but only for a short time and I don't feel like eating much. Please tell me it gets easier.  I know loads of you have probably gone through something similar.  Any advice,suggestions welcome?   Thanks in advance",

      "Content": "Just joined as I recently found lump on armpit and neck.  GP referred me to one stop breast clinic.After clear mammogram in June, wasn't worried.  I am very healthy, fit 54 year old woman. Consultant thought lymphoma or breast cancer, core biopsy from underarm shows carcinoma and although no signs on mammogram, cons thinks it's leading towards breast cancer. MRI and CT scans are being arranged asap.  Meanwhile, an appt has been arranged with oncolgist on Monday 17th.  It's all happening so quickly.  Mixed feelings at the moment - supportive partner but really afraid at times. Anybody have anything similar happen to them? Just putting things down to try and get some perspective. Thanks for reading.",

      "Content": "Having gone from being a very fit active 54 year old to be told I had cancer. Lymph nodes affected, but unable to find primary so have been treated as if breast cancer - but the good news is that having had 3 FEC ( and all the various side -effects!) - I had CT scan and chemo is working dramatically.  The tumours have decreased dramatically.  I knew they had gone down but didn't expect the Oncologist to be so surprised by results. I now have another 3 chemo planned - such joy ! To all those suffering SE from chemo - do bear with it - there can be light at the end of it. I don't know what the final outcome will be but I am ecstatic at the moment - expect FEC on Monday may bring me back down to earth. Many thanks to all the advice and help from this site. :) x    ",
