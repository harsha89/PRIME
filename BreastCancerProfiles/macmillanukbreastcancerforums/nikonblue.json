      "Content": "hi there, I'm in the same corner as you my friend.....had the most awful weepy day yesterday not helped by having my Tamoxifen delivered to the door by my local chemist. Bit unexpected that the gp just sent it out to me. Seeing the meds sent me into a spiral of 'terror' as it hit me  (again) like a ton of bricks that I have breast cancer. I am really scared of the 2 most awful side effects of this drug which I will be on for the next 10 years! How DO we conquer these fears? My journey only started on the 8th September and since then i've had 2 surgeries and all the other horrid things that go with it. Just know that you are not alone. We are ALL there for you, for each other. Take care, Blue",

I always remember days after my diagnosis on telling my friend I had breast cancer, her immediate words to me were \"oh I suppose you might die then, but you know modern research will probably give you about 10 years\" Wasn't quite the support I had hoped for. Another 'friend' who popped in to see me at home after my 1st surgery said \"You have no idea the pain I'm in with this sore foot, been up half the night with it...You'll be over it all now then won't you?\" people just don't think before they speak do they!! Good luck with it all and I'm off to look at the link!! Stay well, Blue :-)",

      "Content": "Hi there, So glad to read all these comments ladies, coz i was beginning to think I was losing the plot!! Well, if there ever was a plot to begin with, I'm waiting to start radiotherapy and see my oncologist a week tomorrow but my surgeon is putting me on Tamoxifen asap. Am really worried about the 'side effects' of this but appreciate it's the best thing. Yesterday I spoke to a friend who keeps saying things such as \"well, thats it all better now\" or \"now that you're operations are done you'll be fine\" etc etc. I've had a few VERY 'blue' days recently and feel like I shouldn't be so damned sad when I'm alive and to all intents, have a good prognosis after 2 surgeries and the forthcoming rad treatment. I'm keeping a written journal of this awful journey I find myself on and aim to have it printed as a book but going over it at the weekend relly got me thinking and wishing people could even TRY and think before they speak....unless you're going through the BC journey, you have no idea how it feels. I know everyone is different but for me this loss of my independance, the fears and tears, the visual scars are all horrible but it's the invisible scars, those emotions playing havoc all the time that scare me the most. I'm a photographer and aim to offer a free shoot to any woman who has BC who would just like a boost to their confidence. I hope to do this after my own treatment ends. Sorry to rant on!!! Here's to ALL us survivors........LET'S GO GIRLS <3",

      "Content": "Hello again, I had a lumpectomy then second surgery as the 'margin' of healthy tissue was uncertain so it meant another op. There is nobody more scared of procedures than me plus I have a very real needle phobia so basket case wasn't the word for how frightened i was. But somehow and from somewhere we DO find the inner strength and determination to cope with it. all of it. Your going through much more than I did and although I now have one breast that looks like it doesn't belong to me, at the end of the day I'm comparatively lucky to still have it. Ask questions about everything no matter if you think it's a silly thing to ask. Make a list of things that are worrying you and take that list to your appointments. I did and believe me one of my first lists was VERY long!! But your breast cancer care nurse can also offer amazing support. I needed to find out a little about what all the 'stages' meant, about the effects of Tamoxifen that I've just started taking and will be for the next 10 years, I also did a bit of research of my own and thats helped loads. Your journey is a tough one and I feel for you, but you WILL find a way of coping. You will have days like the past 3 for me where the whole thing overwhelms you and you just find yourself in tears, it's all part of this awful journey but we are all on that same journey so give us a shout when the going gets too tough and we will support you as best we can. It's the emotional side of this that I've found the hardest, yes, even harder than the surgery!! I live alone and although my friends offer support it sometimes feels as though they think I've just broken a nail and it'll be alright in a day or two....and I am screaming in my head. Life WILL be different, not just the physical side but that dreaded emotional side too. But the alternative doesn't bear thinking about. Life is way too short anyway and falling foul of breast cancer is the pitts, but we CAN fight it.....with a little help from our B.C. friends. I wish you all the very best and take a deep breath, ask your questions and do whats right for YOU!! Take care, Blue x",

      "Content": "hello, I go for the initial prep visit on Tuesday afternoon and they should tell me when the actual sesssions will start. Am really hoping the following week as the 3 weeks treatment would then be finished the week of the 21st! I only just started the tamoxifen this week so far tho, so good. I was very scared to start it as the side effects can be a bit of a problem but, I had my list of questions for my oncologist last wednesday and she has put my mind at rest a bit, well, enough to make me realise that the benifits def outway the wee chances of some side effects. My cancer was oestrogen receptive and I had been on HRT for a long time so thats why i'm now on the tamoxifen ...for 10 years! Needless to say I had to stop the HRT immediately and going cold turkey is pretty tough too with the extra stron 'power surges'......prefer that to 'hot flushes' :-) I totally understand your worries as to how your body will look and you're going through so much more than I have. I'm a singleton though and it's just me who sees my wonky boob! As a photographer my intention is to offer free sessions to women like you, who are going through mastectomy and who need the reassurance that they ARE still beautiful. It so easily could have been me and I have the cheek to cry when I see my own mishapen left breast. Write out that list and never mind if its pages long....ask ask and ask again. Being reassured and able to understand the scary bits on this journey really do help those emotions when they catch you. Try and relax too. Now this is a really daft thing my cancer care nurse told me to try.....and it really did work. As I was so very scared with the needles etc when I felt the fears rising I would say things in my head like:- is the ground beneath my feet hard or soft what sounds can I hear what colour is the doctor/nurse wearing today etc etc it's just a way to distract your mind from your fears even for a few minutes. Give it a try, simple but was definately effective for me. have a good weekend with your other half and lean on him when you have to. take care, Blue x",

      "Content": "hi, Interestingly I received an info pack about this pain pen just the other day and thought about trying it. It costs about £30 and lasts for 2 years and I think if it helps with this unrelenting pain, it will be money well spent. I started on Tamoxifen for 8 months but the side effects, mainly the flushes were unbearable with one dying down only to be hit with another 24/7. Then put on Letrozol......the pains in legs in particular were awful. I also had sudden bleeding having stopped having periods well over 15 years ago! This resulted in 4 months of various procedures to see if I now had endometrial cancer. 6 days before xmas the consultant told me she  thought I did....then called 3 days later to say the biopsy she took showed no sign of the cancer! March saw me having to have a procedure called a hysteroscopy....not pleasant but all fine in there! So, resulting opinion was.......the MEDICATION was causing all this. The pains in my legs from my right hip shooting down to my ankles has become almost intolerable and many times lately I've been close to ditching the meds and taking my chances....but I know that's just not really an option. I was put on Exemastane just a couple of months ago but still the flushes, the leg pain and now add on to the list my feet and hands......god does it ever get better. Don't we have enough to deal with? I can't see where else I can go re medication so the paingone thing might just make the pain more tolerable and allow me to have my life back. Will keep an eye on this thread and see where everyone goes with their pain situations.  Sorry this is so long!! Stay well everyone Blue :-) x",

      "Content": "hi Jen (and all you other lovely ladies) Like many of the girlies on here, I can totally relate to you on this. My so called partner promised to be there \"every step of the way hunni\" the evening before I had my first scary appointment at the breast clinic. Yes, it was cancer and yes i needed surgery and the radiotherapy. You all know that shock feeling of hearing those words, so I sent him a text to let him know........and I never saw him again until he turned up on my doorstep on New Years day!!! You see guys, I'm very emotional about that 'fear' of it coming back so for me I have to teach myself how to live my live in a new 'normal' because my life changed forever that day I was told. Why men are so very insensitive about things? Yes, I have recently found out that my ex just didn't know how to handle it all so he did the ostrich thing and just ignored everything including me....... But now he wants us to start again with a clean slate!! What a fool i'd be eh? God forbid if the b.c. came back i know without a shadow of a doubt that he'd just disappear. Find a Maggie's centre near you if you have them, they are really supportive and talking with people of all ages who really do 'get it' when you say you're emotional or tired etc will give YOU the strength to find something positive in this awfu journey we share. I can't forgive him for basically abandoning me when I needed him the most, without even a call to say \"how are you\" or ask how surgery went. Thats me, only you know how much you can forgive your other halfs hurtful attitude. If he's scared, then get him to tell you that instead of shrugging it all off....if only it were that easy eh ladies? Sorry, didn't mean to waffle on so long!! Blue :-( x",

I've thrown myself into editing my Italy holiday photographs (I'm a photographer) and have done loads this afternoon. I loved Italy but with the recall letter hanging over me, the week was marred a bit with all the 'what if's' that went through my mind. As I was alone traveller I didn't venture out by myself in the evenings so that's when the dreaded panic gripped me. I knew it was breast cancer just a few days after I returned from Italy and basically it's been a total whirlwind of tests, surgery and WAITING for results. It's my left breast that's affected. Lump was removed and thankfully the lymph nodes the surgeon took are CLEAR which I know is really good news although the wound where they were removed is awful, very red and 'lumpy' and quite sore. I will know more on Wednesday when I go back to hospital to have the dressings removed. I like the sound of the few glasses however the last time just a week or so ago that I indulged in the vino....I went into a god awful AF episode which lasted 2 days......as if I'm not tired enough what with this worry and the 'power surges' (hate the expression hot flushes) as I've had to stop the HRT cold turkey.....lordy!! Hang on till I get my fan...here comes another one!!! Thank you for sharing your own situation and I hope to goodness everythings ok for you. This is such a tough journey for us all and each one of us will deal with it all in different ways. But just now and then the realisation that I have breast cancer overwhelms me again and with it comes the tears and now the headache!!! Now, where IS that wine??? take care Blue xx",

      "Content": "Hello all, Advice would be very welcome... At the end on November I started bleeding, after 15+ since having periods...bit of a shock as there was no 'warnings', just bleeding. I have since seen a gynaecologist who first of all told me the biopsy she took didn't look right and that we were most likely looking at endometrial cancer. Needless to say I cried all the way home thinking the beast we know as cancer was back to get me again. It was days before xmas so I decided to keep all this from my family, at least till official results were back and I knew what I was to deal with. 4 days later said consultant phoned e to say the biopsy results were back and showed no signs of cancer!!!! Of course this was the best xmas present but those 4 days were hell. The bleeding stopped on xmas eve. What I wondered was if any of you girls out there have any experience of this sudden bleeding? I was on Tamoxifen for 8 months last year but the flushes were impossible to cope with so my gp changed me to Letrazole. I'm writing a book about my cancer journey and have found time and time again in research that Tamoxifen should only be given to women who have not yet reached the menopause and that makes me wonder if I should never have been on it. Could the change from one to the other cause this bleeding? I was also put on Megace (megastrole acetate) in an attempt to help those damn awful flushes whilst on the Tamoxifen but one of the side effect of the megace is.....FLUSHES!!! I decided to stop taking the megace a couple of weeks ago and this morning, guess what....I'm bleeding!! This experiment is telling me that it's more to do with the meds and as I have an appointment today, I'm going to ask my doc. I feel I've been through enough and sure don't wish to go through these vey unpleasant test and proceedures that may not actually be necessary. I'm also going to push to have a hysterectomy after all this, my thinking is if I don't have a womb then I can't get womb cancer and that's one less thing to worry about. Sorry I've warbled on but if anyone has any experience of this after breast cancer I'd be interested to know. thanks girls, stay well, Blue x",

It was a strange week for me as in the evenings I'd let my fears take over and I put myself through hell. During the days I was out just me and my camera (I'm a photographer, thats what I do) and wandered the streets and visited the sites and soaked in the culture....and some days I was able to forget that I might have nbreast cancer! Off course the reality is that I did, but here I am almost 6 months later and am hoping to return to work in a couple of weeks and as for travelling......well, my son and his family recently moved to Singapore so guess where I'll be heading as soon as I can save up some dosh?? Lets all live for today because tomorrow is promised to no-one. happy travels! Blue :-) x",

I was hoping it would get easier as my body got used to the medication but poor you, after all that time!!! I too have them day and night which means never a full nights sleep and I have a fan on beside my bed half the night. It's really hard as you know feeling wrung out all the time literally, and i must go through 4/5 tshirts a day!!! Please someone tell me this WILL stop!! Be interested to hear how you get on at your appointment on this subject. Take care Blue :-)",

      "Content": "morning Rhonda I felt I was  reading about my own 'power surges' (as I like to call these damned flushes) reading your post just now, but was almost shocked when you said about the 'shivers'. I have almost uncontrollable shivers about an hour after I take the Tamoxifen and if must be related to that because I certainly never had this before. I wake up several times a night like I said then cool down then fall asleep again then wake up with the fan still on and my left side freezing!! Lordy, I just can't win eh? I have a real phobis with needles although I've come through 2 surgeries and all the 'needles' that involved and am really thinking I'm almost at the stage of facing the fear again to help this issue as it's so debilatating. I haven't returned to work yet and worry how in the heck I'll cope in a room with 19 kids (out of school club) when every 20 mins I'm dripping and feeling horrible. Must add that my fear of the tamoxifen prevented me from starting it until I'd seen my oncologist who was almost horrified when I suggested that I have a hystorectomy as a preventative measure. I'm 61 and feel I don't need that bit of my anatomy anymore and if it wasn't there then I can't get womb cancer, which we all know is one of the 'possible' side effects of the Tamoxifen. This scares the Hell out of me I admit. I see my oncologist on the 1st March so will definately be asking about this again. I don't want to face anymore surgery but even more, I don't want to face anymore cancer! We have snow this morning in Fife and yes, I stood outside a while ago taking the dog out and was treated to a massive 'power surge'.......in the snow and freezing cold wind!! :-( take care Blue :-(",

My surgery was on my left breast and i had a bit of infection around the wound at the side where they removed lymph nodes (clear....thankfully) Take it from a very independant singleton.....don't do too much too soon! I just started my radiotherapy last week and have another 5 daily sessions ahead from tomorrow and am crossing them off as I go day to day. So far so good! 2 down....14 to go! I still get the 'nippy' pain shooting through my breast and have a fair bit of pain in my left arm around the elbow but on the inside....apparantly thats to do with the nerve endings....bloomin sore though!

I'm very sceptical about taking this even though my 'flushes' (am also taking Tamoxifen) are unrelentless and I feel totally wiped out. On reading about megace one of the side effects .......FLUSHES!!! I am also a bit unsure about the fact that it can cause 'tumour flare' and 'cardiac failure'....that one scares the hell out of me as I have Atrial Fibrillation which has been all wonky since my B.C journey started! Can I ask  how your mum has coped with this medication. I'm hesitant to start on it when it's so difficult for the pharmacy to source. thanku, Blue :-) p.s. I'm in Fife in Scotland by the way!",

But....she also phoned the company who produce the drug only to be told they won't have any available till the end of April at the earliest! Now, I can't see what good it'll do starting on a medication given to me to try and lessen these awful 24/7 flushes, when I may not be able to source them. I've read a variety of info on this drug and it seems to be given generally to women whose cancer has spread/advanced....just not sure at all. Thank you for getting back to me Blue :-(",

Is there anyone out there who has some encouraging things to say about this Megastrol Acetate? Been awake since 2.15am........yes, power surges all night, and i'm not 'doing' anything...just laying in bed trying to sleep.

I have a constant 'spasm' severe pain in my lower abdomen and seems every time I eat a morsal of food, I need to go to the loo, so my toilet habits are also all to pot!!
