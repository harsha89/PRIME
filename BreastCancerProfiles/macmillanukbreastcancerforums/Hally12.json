      "Content": "Hi Jacky, Don't be too hard on yourself, you've just had a huge op! It will get easier. I'm now 11 weeks post op, I only started driving 10 days ago, as I didn't feel able to move my arm enough or sit very comfy, 20/30 mins is enough though. And I know I've done more as the day wears on, so I'm now trying not to go to mad lol housebound as such for weeks can taste freedom! My tummy feels tight, depends how I sit/move causes problems as such, if I sit too long have to give myself time to stretch out. I felt quite sore bloated after eating, so started eating little and often, which helped, but now doesn't seem to cause as much problems, my consultant said it was because they've stretched all the muscles tendons nerves so it will feel strange, but will settle in time. I seem to have swelling that comes and goes to the side of my breast below armpit, again was a it will settle down, but it seems to get worse if I do too much, has been worse since I've started driving, so I just work in rest days, no point in going mad trying to do it all, I've been through a lot and I will now do what I can when I can, or tough! When I last spoke to my breast care nurse, she said in her experience it's nearer 12weeks to when you start feeling a normal, every one is different pace yourself, you'll get there. And yes I'm getting there, have had and still do have frustrating moments and know doubt there will be more, but hey oh, will overcome it all step by step. Try not to worry about your work, easier said than done I know, but you come under some disability thing with cancer ( I'm sure someone else on here can explain ?) and you can't be made redundant because of illness. So take it easy, don't beat yourself up, you've done well it does get easier x.",

      "Content": "Hi kipper, i started on tamoxifen March 14, stopped for a few weeks in May when I had surgery, and have continued onwards since, the worst 4/5 weeks were awful, but I was told it can take a while for your body to adjust, things then started to settle down, from July  I then had zoladex added into the mix, after a few weeks of headaches, lack of sleep due to hot flashes, I went and saw my doc, and was started on amytripline, the headaches soon went, and the hot flashes calmed so I was getting a good nights sleep, which doc had said that the lack of sleep could of been causing the headaches as it can be a vicious circle. All through the year, my light at the end of the tunnel was my brothers wedding, and my other brothers impending arrival early November, come the end of November I was back at the docs, I' d had a major meltdown, I would of argued black was white to the death, I could feel the rage but I had no control, was scary! Took 2/3 days to come out from under my cloud. My tablets got changed, even though all the side effects from the other two were under control, and now are bearable again...I don't think any thing will be brilliant, just what makes it tolerable is good, and I feel fine in my self, no serious meltdowns as yet lol. But...my doc did say that even though it could be the tablets, it was more than likely that my year had caught up on me as she said we go through a lot,  and I just lost it, staying positive and strong for so long and after my niece was born, I'd ticked off the last thing on my list.... As yet, I have never thought of stopping tamoxifen, or the zoladex even though when I started on it I was told see how you go. Now have one more year of both, have done one ok ish so hopefully I will just continue the same, I'm hoping now every thing has levelled out, it will just continue the same. I trust my consultant, and this it what she thinks is best for me, so I don't see it as an option, just something to deal with lol and it won't be forever, and crikey the last year has flown! so hang in there if you can for a couple of months, give your body time to adjust,  big hugs x.",

The areas shown on the mri, tried yesterday to get a biopsy with ultrasound but couldn't find them, two Dr's tried but weren't convinced of any suspicious areas, but did agree on another possible area. If this is positive then it's a masectomy, if not I have to have an mri guided biopsy on the suspicious areas, if this is positive then again masectomy. Hoping for original plan! but feel the odds are stacked.  If I end up with a masectomy, I will be 65 miles from home for a week, thats awful!!! on top of every thing else, in 15 years of marriage only ever spent half a dozen or so nights apart, and thats only been one night in a year across the years, and he was on courses for work, let alone my kids 13 and 11.  Part of me wants it over as soon as poss, but easter is only in two weeks, would now be nice to spend some family time before it all starts, get results next week, following week is easter, so can't believe one extra week will make much difference, and if I'm stuck from home over bank holiday weekend hardly going to help my head! But of course will listen to consultant, whatever is best for me in the long run, but would be nice thats all. x",

Waiting for wednesday to hopefully get a date for op, as had to have an mri first.
