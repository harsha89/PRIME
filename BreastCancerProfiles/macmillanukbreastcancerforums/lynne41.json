      "Content": "Yes I can really understand about infections,but if they allowed us only one person to accompany us ,my husband could have got me a drink etc without my having to bother the nurses,it's a long time around 5 hours to sit alone feeling awful and I've never forgotten it.",

      "Content": "Thank you all for your lovely replay ,it was almost 4years ago,but adverts like these bring it all back,I can really relate to not wanting to be the cancer victim at coffee mornings.it was my mum's birthday in Sept and I wanted to buy her a Victoria sponge,the one I found in m and s was in a green Macmillan box,so I didn't buy it,thought she wouldn't want reminding of that time on her birthday.I know it was a while ago for me but sitting alone has never left me.thank you girls for letting me rant,and sending best wishes and brighter days ahead for all going through a tough time at the moment.",

      "Content": "The new advert for Macmillan really disturbed me,it features a lady sitting all alone having her chemo.that was me,the ad brings it all back to me,something I thought I was over,apparently not! When you go for your first it's all very supportive and my hubby Sat with me but after that he wasn't allowed to come with me and had to wait in the waiting room for hours while I sat often alone as everyone else had gone home.what is a awful time was made even harder having to sit all alone,nurses popped in now and then but most times I was alone,my treatment was always bit later in the day.can anyone tell me why he couldn't sit with me and hold my hand through what was very hard times,he has always been with me through all my treatments and I'm very fortunate,I know .x",
