    "Content": "Mike So good to hear your story. Very inspiring and great to see you back doing something you enjoy. I've been lucky and managed to keep running - short and slow- throughout my chemo which finished two weeks ago. I've done several parkruns, and will be there again tomorrow morning, running in the rain! I have radiotherapy to go in a few weeks and am looking forward to regaining my fitness. I'm running the London Marathon in April to raise money for breast cancer now. Keep on running x",
