      "Content": "Hi all, Whilst myself and the rest of the Online Community team try not to post in our groups too often, I thought it best I address the above comments. First off I'm really sorry to read of how the recent TV advert has left some of you feeling. Macmillan of course welcomes all feedback, and takes it into consideration when it comes to future reviews of our services and advertising. If you wish to forward on your feedback, you're best doing so using the feedback form available on our website. The team will aim to respond to all feedback within 3 working days. Thanks, Jimmy Online Community Team",
