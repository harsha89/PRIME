      "Content": "Jude58 I am 59 and had breast cancer with 3 lots of surgery, one of them being a mastectomy, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. I was a full time secretary prior to this. I have struggled so much being back at work. The fatigue is so debilitating. I would love to give up work but at the moment waiting till I'm 60 next March. I can get my pension then which is not enough to survive on. I could work part time 3 days a week to supplement it. What I wanted to ask does anyone know if in those circumstances and if my doctor would do a note saying I'm not fit enough to be able to work could I claim benefits? I feel guilty thinking this but at the moment I'm barely coping and just existing. ",

I've put phased plan in which they should have received at latest by Tuesday and confirmed it was sent, but nothing back ....... I've worked for this company for almost 19 years ......

I am TN so will have radiotherapy. Keeping positive and trying to keep as normal as possible has got me through, I did not succumb to google searching just followed this group which has been a massive support even though they haven't known it, but this is where you will get your answers.  On my down times, not many of them, my sons and close friends would remind me that the side affects I have faced are only temporary and that in itself is a positive thought. Try and occupy your mind as much as possible believe me it does help with the positive attitude. Your body will amaze you of what it is capable of dealing with. So go fight this critter and you can beat it ...... After all the first three letters of the word say you can.  I have had marvellous support from my oncologist and surgeon so put your trust in them too.  Soups xx",

My tumours have really shrunk and I'm chuffed. The first 3 have gone really quickly as will the next three, I cross them off and know that the next one I will be two thirds done.  Speak to your oncologist but stick with it if you can, give yourself the best chance of beating it's ass Lol.   nicky",
