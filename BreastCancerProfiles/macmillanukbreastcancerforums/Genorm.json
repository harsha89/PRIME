      "Content": "Thanks to Cat, June & Wendi for your supportive posts. It is reassuring to know that others are in the same boat (although I don't want anyone else to struggle!) At this point 5 years seems like a long haul, but we can hope the side effects may reduce soon. It would be encouraging if anyone on anastrozole or letrozole, who feels these symptoms lessening, would post again with the good news! Thanks again and best wishes to everyone x",

      "Content": "Hi, I wondered if anyone else was really struggling with either of these 2 drugs. I have alternated between the two and both have a very poor effect on my muscles, tendons and particularly joints and bones. I have a job where sitting down is not a realistic option, so I have to keep going. I was a fit, sporty 56 year old and losing mobility is bad for my overall health - I feel I should be exercising, but most days, a short walk of 10 minutes is plenty. I do find that first thing in the morning, I am very stiff and this eases slightly during the day. However late afternoon and all night, the pain intensifies in my hands, shoulders, knees and feet. Moderate painkillers don't really work and the strong variety leave me way too fuzzy for work. Obviously I realise why I am on aromatase inhibitors and that there is no alternative, but I am hoping others here may have found a way of getting through the 5 years, we are meant to take them. So far I've done 8 months and my symptoms are getting worse by the week. Thanks for any suggestions. ",

      "Content": "Hi, I'm due my 5 years up appointment shortly with a doctor of the breast surgery department and would like to know from anyone, whether I am entitled to a bone scan or do I have to push for one. I was signed off from the oncologist 3 years ago and haven't seen one since.  I will have the issue of continuing anastrozole for a further 5 years to discuss too. This is my second cancer experience and I know what being a bit marooned feels like. I need to know what I can fight for here. Any views would really be welcome, thanks all.",

      "Content": "Thank you to all for the helpful replies. I live in an area where the major hospitals are in 'special measures', so I am wary of cost-cutting steps. Even before the 'special measures' were in place, we were told that if we did not hear about our mammogram results, then we should assume all is OK. When I said, '.... but this is cancer we are talking about and I am contactable by text and email', the response was 'that's the way it is here'. I know that the oncologists have a massive patient load, but I was surprised that I was signed off so soon.  Certainly a bone scan after 5 years would help me as to whether I should carry on with anastrozole. I will come back here with how I got on with my request. Thanks again all  x",

      "Content": "Has anyone tried several brands of Anastrazole, to see if their side effects improve with one brand rather than another? I am 18 months into the 5 year haul, but really struggling with bone pain and tendon pain. I still get joint stiffness, am carrying a bit extra weight (doh!) and have headaches, but it is the pain that is mucking my life up. I am the main salary earner, so need to keep going at work. Of course by the time I get home I'm bushed; however at the weekend we would normally go for walks. I can't do this because of the pain and immobility in my feet. I'm hating all this stuff - I feel lightyears away from proper exercise. I read on one of the discussions about Wockhart as a brand that seemed to help more than others. I asked my chemist who said, '...never heard of them, probably can't get them. Try Boots.' Charming. My GP surgery were more helpful and I have found out now, that Wockhart dont' make anastrazole any more. So far I have tried Teva, Accord and Activis - all disappointingly similar; Roxane and Maylan to try yet. Does anyone have a preferred brand? Sorry to whinge, guys, but sometimes it just needs to get out there.",

My 'annual' visit to the breast surgeon isn't until December. As there was no sign of a mammogram appointment, I phoned the unit and was told 'the surgeon decides if you need one.' Does this sound correct, I really thought we had one every year regardless? Anyone had a similar response? Thank you xx",

      "Content": "Hi Maggie, I was glad to read your post - especially the bit about being on Anastrazole for over 2 years. I am on that too, having tried Letrozole also, but gone back to anastrazole (only done one year so far, 5 years seems so far away, and even then I may have to persevere with it, I have been told.) My issues are all about bone pain and stiffness - trouble getting out of the car, bath, some chairs. Now I am walking very badly; my knees and feet are unbending, so much so that my posture was so rubbish I 'pinged' my back! Aargh. I am worried about my fulltime job because of all this. Tramadol is a brilliant painkiller, but I can't handle  the 'spaced out' effect at work and it obviously doesn't unstiffen my joints. I am trying to be positive after getting my head round this (my second cancer) and was hoping for a lesser impact of the anastrazole. Thanks to everyone here in the same boat, who all help in small but so important ways. ",
