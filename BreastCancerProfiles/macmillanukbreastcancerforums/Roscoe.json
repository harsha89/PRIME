      "Content": "Hello everyone out there. This is my first post so if i go on a bit, please bear with me. My name is Ross, i'm 38 and partner to a lovely lady called Jo, 39. We have 2 little boys aged 3 and 6. 4 weeks ago Jo was diagnosed with stage 1 breast cancer after finding a lump in her left breast. We have been on a roller coaster ride ever since experiencing all the highs and lows this condition throws at you. We have had the first week of 'am i going to die', moving on to getting the good news that the cancer is contained to the breast and so far have no evidence that it has spread to the lymph nodes. Initially,  the greatest concern is just surviving this thing and Jo being there for the boys. You feel like you've been given a death sentence when you first hear the word cancer so thankfully we are now in a place where we have the opportunity to fight and win!! Perhaps one should always feel like cancer is a fight to be won and i appologise to anyone reading this who is  currently struggling to believe their fight is winable, i don't mean to be negative, just expressing the way i personally see it. A positive attitude is one of the best weapons you can have through a thing like this though (5 months ago Jo's sister inlaw was diagnosed with Hodgekins lymphoma and has been a superstar, not letting it get her down. Last monday she went for her first scan since starting chemo and there is now no cancer left in her body!!! way to go sis!, one down, one to go!!) but i am sometimes guilty of pessimism? We are now though faced with a decision to make. Jo is going to require a full mastectomy and We (sorry, i keep saying 'we' but Jo really is the better half of me, i feel this is journey we are both on together although all final decisions are Jo's and i will support her in any decision she makes) have been given choices as to whether or not to have the reconstruction now or later and which procedure to have. Jo is adamant that she wants the breast reconstructed now but we have 2 options really. The frist option is the TRAM using fat and muscle from the abdomen, second option is taking the tissue from the back but that would require an implant too. One thing they cannot tell us at present is whether or not Jo will require radiotherapy. We have been advised that a course of chemotherapy would be recommended but that would be our choice? (no choice as far as we are concerned? if it's recommended then Jo will have it) but radiotherapy will affect the implant. There are so many question marks, variables, pro's and cons over all this that we feel we are at a fork in the road and have no confidence whatsoever to take either path. How do you choose which way to be disecteded and then rebuilt? Whilst we are not stupid people, we are not surgeons and have no medical knowledge and are finding this decision almost impossible to make. Has anyone else experienced this? does anyone know what dictates the need for radiotherapy and why would it be needed if a course of chemo is already on the cards as i thought chemo would rid the body of all cancer (hopefully). It seems odd that a few weeks ago Jo couldn't of cared less about losing her breast and just wanted to live only now to be in such turmoil about reconstruction? Just rambling now. Help.................",

      "Content": "Hi everybody, sorry for the delay in responding, i posted yesterday just before we went to see our cancer nurse, which i thought was going to be further discussions regarding procedures etc but didn't realise we would come out having made a decision and getting our surgery dates???? As i said before, Jo is adamant that she wants to have the reconstruction at the same time as the mastectomy so with all options considered (over and over and over again!!) Jo has opted for the tram flap. She is aware of the implications regarding recovery periods etc but has decided to bite the bullet and deal with it in one hit. She has a sentinel node biopsy appointment for next week and will be having her surgery on the 25th of this month. So now begins a new chapter on the path to wellbeing! It's amazing how your emotions turn completely upside down as each new chapter begins and the 'only' considerations one day become ancient history the next. I called for help yesterday assuming that we would come out of the meeting still spinning with all the options but hoping we would be a little clearer and that somebody would have replied to my post with info or opinions that would clarify our feelings a little more so i guess the topic of this post is now redundant? Don't worry though, there will be other posts i'm sure as the time goes by and as new challenges present themselves. However, that fact that people that don't even know Jo and I, but have experience of what we are going through, can care about us and can empathise is really really helpful and somewhat humbling. The kindness of strangers (not implying any of you are strange btw) is a powerfull thing and for that i  thank you Debra, Barbara, Maree and Tangodancer!! i will endevour to keep you posted (if anyone is interested?) and maybe just post a little rant from time to time. If anyone wants to contact me then please feel free. Thanks again for now (i feel i will be thanking people a lot in the next few months?!) and speak soon. Ross Kia Kaha!! (maouri phrase meaning 'forever strong' i'm trying i'm trying)  ",
