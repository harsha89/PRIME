      "Content": "Hi Lone Fox - Sorry it has taken me so long to respond following your reply to my thread... I sort of faded off the Macmillan site as mum went through her initial stages with Taxotere. She has had another dose now and has her last one next week. She is actually 71, a fit 71 albeit! Her experience of the Tax has been that it was horrible after the first session, totally exhausted and pain and she was feeling pretty strongly that she never wanted to go through it again. About 2 weeks after her first dose of it she started feeling a little better and she called to make an appointment with her oncologist to ask if she really had to take it again! Of course he said yes, but I think this appointment really helped her, they listened to her and gave her the reasons why taxotere was best for her. They also spread the steroids she took after her second tax session out over about 10 days... this seemed to help and she felt better for those days but when the steroids stopped so did she! She had a couple of very exhausting days and felt pretty 'out of it' and again felt like she couldn't do another taxotere... but she is due her final tax next wednesday and today she has started to feel better and is getting ready for the last blast! From what I have picked up from speaking with her you really do just have to take it day at a time and there will be days when the very idea of taking any more of this stuff is too awful to consider. But the body and mind are amazing and there will be a better day when it seems possible! Wishing you all the luck and strength as you go through your own chemo, any more questions just let me know! Hannah PS. It's also worth mentioning that she has been hit hard with chemo because her tumour was large and advanced... I know other people have a much easier time on Tax",

      "Content": "Cellogirl - I know my mums biggest fear was that it would go on for months, or even worse forever... I think people in the medical profession are very careful what promises they make because they never know how each individual will respond... but from what I have seen and heard, you will start feeling better. I've seen with mum how bad she gets when she starts to worry about everything else as well, my advice is to take it day at a time and focus on getting better.... you will get back to work eventually but right now just take it step by step. Â  wishing you some restful nights Hannah",

      "Content": "My poor mum is suffering terrible pain throughout, it's about 4 days after her first Taxotere dose and this is the worst she has been so far through all the chemo. I can tell it's just taken it out of her completely. It's the first time that I felt my phone calls don't help - she's just too exhausted and in pain. But I can't think what else I can do to help. Is there anything anyone can suggest to help her... any advice on dealing with Taxotere would be greatly appreciated. Also my sister has warned me that it is possible that mum might feel this bad for months, even after the taxotere? Has anyone any experience on this... I really want it to be over for her! Thanks for all you thoughts Hannah",

      "Content": "I'm actually asking this question for my 71 year old mum - she's just had her second FEC chemo of 3 after which she will have 3 taxotere. She has a largish tumour, invasive ductal carcinoma which had spread to one lymph node under her arm, she will have mastectomy and radiotherapy after the chemo... I've been speaking with her daily, she's being very strong but is also very afraid. One of her main fears is that she will never really be healthy again, and that the chemo and other treatments will have permanent effect on her so that she never feels healthy again... can anyone shed a little light on this? I'll be sending her any responses, she does e-mail but hasn't quite managed to get on the Macmillan site yet. She's an exceedingly fit 70 + year old but I think she worries that this is the start of a decline and she's keen to have some idea of how long it will take before she feels more like herself, right now she says she doesn't feel like herself and I know this is getting her down Any thoughts would be great!
