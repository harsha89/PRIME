    "Content": "Hi Bev Read through your posts with interest, my partner had reconstruction straight after full mastectomy and was a 34D prior to that (implants).  What would you like to know???   We have been advised that FEC is the avenue they want to send her down, have been given a week to think about it and return to the hospital!   My partner is 38 years old by the way!  And they have done a superb job in my humble opinion!   Take care, all the best",
