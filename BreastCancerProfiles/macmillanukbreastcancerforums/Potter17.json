      "Content": "Hi can anyone help. I\u2019ve been today for a mamma, ultrasound and biopsies of both breast after finding a very small but very deep lump When I went back to see the consultant I asked how many biopsies were cancerous and he said all of them! I was a bit shocked. Then he said he had put me down at level 3 but if it was a 4 or 5 he would have said I have cancer and start treatment straight away, but said it was likely I did. so now I\u2019m waiting for the results. Does that sound right? Does anyone know what the score system he was referring to to give any more light on this.  Would a consultant say you had cancer before a biopsy either way I\u2019m now in a total mind mess and hence why I\u2019m writing this at 3.40am!  Can anyone help. Thanks ",
