    "Content": "I had a left Mx with tissue expander in April and have had no problems so far except the expected feeling of discomfort from being full of saline solution! My problem initially when trying to make the decision, was that I could find no one who had neither had an expander nor any other kind of implant to share the experience with. Eventually, at the appointment when I made my final decision to go ahead, I was able to talk to a fellow patient who happened to have an appointment the same day who had gone through the same treatment and had exchanged her expander for a silicone implant three months earlier with no problems. My female surgeon had done many of these reconstructions but in telling me it was difficult to find someone who'd gone through the experience because they were at work was in itself encouraging. Having had very little experience of the medical world before being diagnosed with bc following a routine mammagram and having not met anyone who'd disclosed their bc diagnosis and treatment to me, I had to rely on my consultant's advice. Although I also researched the subject on the internet, I was confident I was going to get the most suitable treatment for me from my surgeon and my hospital unit. Reading blogs like this helped me immensely so thanks to all you contributors.",
