      "Content": "Hi Vickyr81 Slightly different to you, I was recalled after a mammogram but I guess it will be the same process they go through.  When I got to the clinic, I had a quick chat with one of the breast care nurses who told me what tests they might do.  I had a mammogram of the affected boob followed by an ultrasound and then, during the ultrasound I had biopsies - these were painless as I was given a local anesthetic first. I didn't take anyone with me on this appointment - I was a bit blazé about it at the time but in hindsight I would have preferred to have someone with me. Hope it all goes well for you, good luck Sarahxx",

      "Content": "Hi Yorka I was diagnosed on 3rd December and had my surgery on 22nd.  My BCN told me that Grade 2 and ER +ve gives me a really great prognosis and that it is very treatable - still doesn't stop me being scared though but we will get through this.   If I could take my self back a couple of weeks to give myself some advice it would be not to bottle it up and to open up to friends.  Yes, its really hard to respond to that question \"Hi, you Ok?\" with \"Actually no I'm not really I've just been diagnosed with Breast Cancer\" but, once its out there it makes such a difference having people to talk to, my husband also said the same.
