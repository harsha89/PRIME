      "Content": "At my first hospital appointment, a Dr examined me then sent me for a mammogram, ultrasound and a biopsy.  I was then seen by the first Dr again, plus 2 nurses, and was told that they think it was cancer, but the biopsy results, in a week's time, would confirm or otherwise.  So I asked how certain they were at that stage, and was told 90%.  Apparently, sometimes the biopsy can show a surprising result. Well, in my case it wasn't surprising, but it was treatable and curable, so after a lumpectomy and SNB I am now clear and awaiting radiotherapy and hormone tablets. Good luck, you could still be in that 10%, and if not, you get to start the treatment early.",

      "Content": "Well, the whole reason for a 2-week referral is the suspected breast cancer.  It doesn't mean it is cancer, actually in the majority of referrals it's not, but that's what they are trying to determine/rule out. I pity the GPs, they can never get it right!  Mine said \"it's probably not cancer\", and then I felt really shocked and disappointed when told in hospital that yes, it was!  The whole thing is very emotionally charged, and they never know how a person will react. Good luck at your appointment!",

      "Content": "My biopsy didn't hurt, although the noise had me jump - even though the Dr showed me how it works in advance.  The local anaesthetic felt a bit like a cat scratch, though.   Afterwards I had a bruise and a bit of swelling, but it wasn't really painful. I had a biopsy because I went to the hospital with a lump, so you might not even need one, but if you do, it's really not that bad!  Good luck!",

      "Content": "Hi all, maybe you can give me some ideas.  I hooe it's not too inappropriate a question! It's exactly 2 months since I first felt a lump in my breast, and since then I've had GP/hosp appts, tests and surgery (lumpectomy) and am waiting to find out what further therapy is needed (probably radio and hormone - will find out on Friday).  It was a bit of a rollercoaster, and I have told my close family face to face, and my partner told his close friends (who are my friends too), but I have some friends that I don't see that often and I haven't mentioned anything to them yet.  It's not a thing you blurt out in a text, or even an email - or is it? Today is my birthday and I'm getting Facebook messages from family, friends and acquaintances, some of whom know what I'm currently going through.  I'm almost thinking about posting a FB status saying thanks to well-wishers and that's especially appreciated as I now have breast cancer.  But it sounds so terrible put like that!  Also it's TMI and people don't want to see that sort of thing on FB...  I don't know. How did you communicate the news to your friends and acquaintances?",

I didn't take this opportunity to announce my condition on FB, after all.  I did inform a few people by email or private message, but I've now decided that it's not something that everyone needs to know.  There are still a few more people that I'd like to tell, but I'll wait for an appropriate chance to do so. Thanks again, and if anybody else would like to contribute their experiences, please do!",
