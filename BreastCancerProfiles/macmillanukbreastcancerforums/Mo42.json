      "Content": "i was diagnosed with secondary progressive MS almost 20 years ago. Since then despite restricted mobility my husband and I have continued to live a full and normal life with our family and friends. After a routine blood test in February I was diagnosed with CLL but that it was a condition which would not impact on my life and would simply be monitored.  At the end of May we returned from almost a month abroad feeling fit and healthy. The following week I saw my doctor as an indentation, which I thought was as a result of a wired bra, had been there for several weeks. I was immediately referred to the breast clinic in our local hospital. By the end of the week I was told that I had breast cancer. I'd had a mammogram and ultrasound to confirm this but wouldn't know which type of tumour it was until the results a biopsy were back. I'd had regular mammograms until 5 years ago when I was 70 and had never had a recall. I was absolutely shell shocked and felt that this was just too much to deal with. I was still hoping that it would be benign though deep down I knew that it wasn't! When I saw the consultant again a fortnight later I was told that it was a triple negative tumour and that the best treatment would be chemotherapy followed by a mastectomy. Due to the MS he wasn't sure whether I would be able to have the chemotherapy and that it would depend on the oncologist. I said that I was sure that I was strong enough. I have always had a very positive attitude and been determined to continue to lead as active a life as possible. This just seemed like a step too far despite the positivity of both my husband and son who were with me at the consultation. I didn't want to socialise or speak on the phone even to my closest friends. Our two children and their families have been amazing and gradually I began to believe that I could beat this. We have 5 grandchildren the eldest being 8 and I will be there to watch them grow up. My friends have been so supportive once I let them in. My oncologist recommended that I start with 9 sessions of weekly Taxol chemotherapy followed  by 3 sessions of Epirubicin and cyclophospha at 3 week intervals. I am also taking antibiotics 3 days a week to boost my immunity. I have now had 2 treatments so 2 steps on the road to recovery. Apart from a panic last week which was actually most probably brought on by something I had eaten, I have felt alright. We called the helpline and got immediate advice. Very little energy and feeling tired and achy but that I can live with. I now have a doze after lunch and go to bed early which is helping. I also find eating small meals with occasional snacks is best, also I don't eat late. Whenever I've felt queasy I've taken a sickness tablet which has been very effective. My hair is still intact though this week I went to get my wig, something else that I was dreading and another box ticked. I know it's very early days and the worst is yet to come but I can do this and please if you've only just been diagnosed try not to despair. The consultants and nurses are wonderful, the helpline superb and advice always there. ",
