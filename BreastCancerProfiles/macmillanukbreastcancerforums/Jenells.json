      "Content": "Hi all, Posted a couple weeks back about itchy nipple area and concerned for possible pagets. Gp gave me steroid cream which made it worse! Since then they have referred me and got breast clinic appointment on thurs morning. Anyway, just a quick qu to ask if I should cancel as the itching has gone down quite a bit and now worried I've made a big fuss about nothing?

      "Content": "Thanks for the replies everyone - given me a sort of peace of mind that I am not wasting anyone's time etc... I am obviously hoping it will be nothing but clearly I am a worrying mess - keep imagining worse case scenarios. But hubby is coming along to support me and has been such a rock in all my anxiety.  Already so so touched by this community. Love to you all and super strength for going through each of your own journeys with BC. Xxx",
