      "Content": "Hi, I finished all treatments just over 2 yrs ago and I still feel fatigued as well. My immune system is also still low so pick up colds sore throats etc a lot. Gp said anastrozole can cause this as well as the fatigue and aches and pains, at moment I'm on it for at least 10 yrs. I think people do tend to think you've gotten tho the cancer so get back to normal, you look ok so should be ok. I walk with my dogs for an hour mornings and late afternoon and really enjoy it but like you need a rest mid afternoon so I have one, do things bit at a time and pace yourself. I get my pjs on and watch TV in bed from 6-7 most evenings and tend to do as much or little as I want. My life has changed a lot but  Iv accepted it, look after yourself don't worry about what others think.",

      "Content": "Been to Gp today for a review-couldn't order presc until I had been-and yet again feel rushed and that gp is not really listening. He took blood pressure but didn't do or ask anything else, I had to mention I need blood test to check my thyroid levels. He didn't ask how I was just typing notes up. I had seen him 6 wks ago and had to have antibiotics to shift a chesty cold I'd had for ages and felt like I was bothering him then,he actually replied to an email while I was talking and then he asked me to repeat what I'd said. Before I was diagnosed with breast cancer just over 2 yrs ago I didn't need to see my previous GP very often but he was very supportive and listened. Does anyone else feel this lack of support. Thanks x",

      "Content": "Thanks for your replies. I'm not very good at confrontation, but if I'd have spoken up it would have been better as he probably doesn't realise how he is coming across. There is another GP who does one day a week as its only small surgery,rest of staff are lovely and my previous GP was very good. This GP took over just as I had finished my cancer treatments and was starting on anastrozole and other meds. He seemed less rushed then but I don't go to the Drs often and i stick to why I'm there- they are not therapists-but is it too much to be asked how everything is? Will address it if happens again and if GP doesn't acknowledge me will speak to manager.  Feel better getting it off my chest as I felt upset about it and then thought maybe I'm being over sensitive.
