      "Content": "Hi. Don't know if i'm in the right place but wife was tolled she had breast cancer this week and  although I was there and  asked  Questions  I feel A bit lost. My wife is going round telling her friends  and  planing  her work time  which I know is good, but I don't know how to feel. I still feel as if its not  real as she looks fine and is still  at work.  We have  talked but only about  the kids and  what needs to be done  not how we feel. I'll be here any time she does want to  talk, but  should I show I'm worried  or try to carry on as if  nothings wrong? Every one I know who as had breast cancer  as made a full recovery   but I know it  is not always like that so  I'm a bit  confused.",

      "Content": "My wife had her opp on  Friday and  I was  ready to  do  jobs round the house  feed the kids  etc,  Shes had  opps before and  a few days rest and shes been  fine. All  yesterday she  had been resting  but felt  fine if a little  sore, so today She wanted to  get out  of the  house so we went for a short walk in town and all seamed good.  Half way we stopped  so she could  rest  when she sat down she sudenly felt really  dizzy, sick,  hot and sticky  but  cold to the touch.  I got her straight  home  and  shes just slept  since.  We don't know if it was to much to  soon or  the medication (pain killers) not agreeing with her,  but  its  been a real  shock to us both and  I think the reality  of  what lies ahead is finely sinking in. .",
