MacMillan called my doctor yesterday who came to my home and she said its overactive bowel. so been given codeine and buccastem to take. Codeine relieves the pain for a short while, really dont want to pill pop all the time. has anyone else had this problem and if so what help did you get. As I have been told just to get on with it. Pain is unbearable some times and been housebound. any advice?",

      "Content": "Hi, I had a skin saving mastectomy last Thursday. It was the only choice I had and then had yo have all nodes taken. please don't lose faith with your breast team. I'm not much help as I go with the flow, but don't forget you will be seen by the best and will have follow up appointments for the next 5 years. no one has the same feelings but I did struggle with a mastectomy, wondering how I would look like etc, because at first i was just going to have an op to remove a 3cm tumour, that turned into a 6.5cm tumour and others when i had my MRI. don't panic just talk your fears through and remember, MacMillan are at the end of the phone and they've been great. They listen and explain what you don't understand or what you worry about. Also the MacMillan nurse at your hospital they are there also. let me know how you get on xx",

I dont have a partner to lean on, so it does make it harder to plan appointments and try to recover while running a home for my two children. friends are great and let me know the gossip from work. Everyone seems to know what's going on, I seem to have to wait, for them to tell me what they're going to do. please let me know how you get on. Karen",
