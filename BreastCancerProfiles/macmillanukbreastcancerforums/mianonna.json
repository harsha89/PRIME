      "Content": "Thanks granny59. Had read about joint and muscle pains and have had these off and on in leg but shoulder pain constant. Also really aware of having had such a large lump diagnosed so late and how often breast cancer spreads to bone. Unfortunately wont get mri for another month at best. Thanks for reply. Cant really voice my concerns to family when they are happy that 'treatment' now finished and everyone enjoying Christmas.",

      "Content": "Hi was diagnosed with er+ grade 3 breast cancer after finding large lump (5cm+) in left breast. After surgery lump had decreased in size showing letrozole working but nil margin and spread to skeletal tissue. Stopped letrozole when starting chemo but that had to be stopped because if bad reaction. So now after radiotherapy wondering whether nagging pain in shoulder signals spread. Anyone else with similar experience? Waiting for MRI to find out if pain due to spread to bone or linked to past history of shoulder problems. Need to add I am 71 abd had mastectomy on right 22 years agi",
