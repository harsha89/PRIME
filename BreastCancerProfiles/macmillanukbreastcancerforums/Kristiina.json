      "Content": "Hi Nicky, I totally agree with Dolina. It'surprisingly big surgery and takes more time to recover. If you follow the instructions with lifting, resting, excercise etc you will be fine. But you will need help at home to start with. First  I wasn't sure if DIEP was the right choice for me because of the big scar in tummy,  but it doesn't bother me at all and my breast looks very natural. New breast is smaller than the healthy one because I am little bit slim and didn't have quite enough fat. But never mind, other one will be adjusted.  I had my operation 7 weeks ago and am still bit bent walking as my tummy was pulled very tight but it's stretching slowly and I'm almost there. I definitely would do it again. My surgeon is brilliant and pays special attention to the shape. He is very nice too so I've been lucky! I just had my first EC chemo yesterday. I'm having light hang over feel but that's all so far, waiting for it all to kick in. Six months of chemo to look forward to!!! This is my first time to post here and I wasn't sure whether to reply to original post or the last one so apologies if this went out of sync! All the best with your meeting Nicky, if you have any more questions Just contact me and I'm happy to shear all my experience. And by the way I'm 45 so one of the 'young ones' as well Pia xx",

      "Content": "Hi Terri, I had my last EC yesterday (4/4). Overall it has been easier than I expected. Saying that though side effects have  built up towards the end and nausea has been bit worse and more fatigue.  Generally I've had 5 days of hangover, sleepless nights because of hot flushes (I'm on Zolodex as well) and also steroids keep me awake but it's only while I take them. So after first week I've been fine, just bit tired and suffering from 'chemo brain'. I've have 12 weekly taxol to look forward to after this. Hope it's going to work out fine for you as well, and like somebody already said, the first chemo sets the tone so I think it's looking good for you. Oh and my hair started to thin after 14 days or so. I've been cold capping so still have most of it left. Look after yourself, Pia",

      "Content": "Hi Jacster, Please forget that npi index, it's 30 years old! It gave me 17% survival and it's rubbish. If you want to check survival stats there are more up to date indicators online. But as all said before, we are individuals so how much you want to focus on them is another matter. Interesting discussion about stress. I tend to stress about everything and I also work in male dominated kind of demanding environment. I've been fine with that and quite enjoy working with most of my male golleagues. But I feel like my stress levels have rocketed since having a child with my current partner. He is happy go lucky and bread winning, organising, planning, doing etc has been left to me and needless to say caused several arguments over the years. I'm convinced my tendency to stress has played some part with my cancer. I'm trying very hard to stop this stressing and letting things go. It's hard but I think I've made some progress and am more able to 'live in the moment' than before.  Pia xxx",
