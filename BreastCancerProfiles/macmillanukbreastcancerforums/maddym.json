    "Content": "Hi when I lost my hair I bought two wigs from \"Simply Wigs\". The quality was excellent I took them to my hairdressers who trimmed them to exactly fit my face. I had people ask me why I hadn't lost my hair when I had chemo. My hair has grown back now but I still sometimes wear my wig if I'm having a bad hair day.",
