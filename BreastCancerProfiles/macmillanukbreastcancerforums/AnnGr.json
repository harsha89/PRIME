    "Content": "Hi Joanna. I am 47 and I went through the same course and finished at the end of April. I was given a list of foods not to eat, which included pate, unpasturised cheese and shellfish and raw or undercooked eggs or meat. I suppose it it like being pregnant. I was told I could have manuka honey, so every morning I had porridge with a spoonful of manula honey, it helps your immune system, and I went through the whole course without getting any infections at all. There were a few days that porridge was the only thing that I could eat but not too many, ginger biscuits helped with the nausea. I also found that a little bit of Green and Black;s chocolate tasted good when my taste had gone funny, but other cheaper chocolate brands tasted awful. I went off tea and even plain water, but heavily watered down orange juice was easy to drink. Oral Thrush is one of the symptoms of the taxotere drug and that makes your taste even worse. Your tongue will get covered in a white coating, if this happens then you need a prescription to clear it, at the first sign of it get on to your chemo nurses and they will sort you out. I kept going to work most of the time and travelled on public transport a few times most weeks. Wearing make-up makes you look and feel better and some chemo units have lessons on how to do your make-up or even have beauty salons who offer a free lesson for chemo patients. Ask the nurses in your unit. I had to switch to a sensitive skin moisturiser as my normal clinique one made my skin break out. I too had very thick wavy hair, but after two cold cap sessions, I gave up as my hair fell out anyway. It works for some people but not all. I found that mostly I felt ok for 2 days after the chemo, then the symptoms kicked in on the 3rd day, usually when the steriods stopped, When I had my second Taxotere I took the steriods for a few days longer, gradually taking smaller doses over 5 days, and felt much better doing that, but dont do that without talking to your oncologist first. Your veins and your lower arm can get a bit sore as the chemicals can affect the veins, the nurses told me to get some Potter;s comfrey massage oil which I did, massage it into your arm every day and it does help with the pain. its not expensive, only about Â£3 for a bottle from Holland and Barrat. I would say you should keep active as much as you can, a bit of normality really takes your mind off what you are going through, being with people who dont know what you are going through really helps not to dwell on things too much. Good luck with the treatment and as my oncologist told me constantly, be sensible and listen to your body, do what you feel like doing and dont do what you dont. Ann x",
