    "Content": "I was on Tamoxifen for 3 years with very few side effects before transferring to Letrozole as part of a Breast Cancer Trial that I had agreed to take part in. I suffered from severe pains in joints of my legs, arms and shoulders and had problems turning on taps, opening jars etc. After 6 months I asked my oncologist to put me back on Tamoxifen and eventually the aches and pains decreased. I was taken off all medication in June this year after my 5 years on medication. I found that certain brands of a Tamoxifen gave me migraine and stuck to the one brand ie Wokhart. Hope this helps.
