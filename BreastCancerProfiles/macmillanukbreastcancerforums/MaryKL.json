Like one of your other respondents I haven`t found it nearly as bad as I expected.  Some nausea but no sickness and very tired (even fell asleep with fork half way to mouth one evening!) from day 2 to day 8.  Also a bit constipated for this time. Then 3 mornings with diarrhoea - fine by midday but after that it all settled and since then I have felt ok. I`ve had the usual emotional up and down days but no really bad physical symptoms. No mouth ulcers, dry mouth or metallic taste.  The hair started to go last week and I will shave off the final strands this evening I think. I`ve talked to a few others on FEC and my experience seems fairly standard among those but there may be others who found it difficult. I had the nuclear bone scan yesterday and that was fine but haven`t been offered a CT scan.  No ill effects from the bone scan and I`d say you`d be fine to fly.. Stay away from cliffs!!

      "Content": "Sorry Sascha,  I think FEC is addling my brain.   I meant that you couldn`t use stuff before going for treatment because the rays don`t penetrate properly but that it is ok  once you get home so I thought I would go in the morning, be able to moisturise afternoon and evening but make sure it was thoroughtly washed off for the following morning. I obviously need to check to make sure that I didn`t misunderstand. I was advised to get pure soap from a herbal shop as I don`t know what it is either and always use soap free products.  I`ll check with my chemo mate Susie as she had her first appointment this week and see what advice she was given and I`ll get back to you.

      "Content": "Hi Sascha,  Haven`t started radiotherapy yet as you know but at my initial meeting with the radiologist she said I was not to use anything at all on the skin other than a shower with pure soap on the day of treatment but on subsequent days to use pure aloe vera.  She also said she will have a list of recommended creams for me when I go for the scan and marking and stressed the importance of keeping the skin moisturised. I don`t use soap either as I have excema but  if it is only treatment day then that will be ok. I told you about my brother and he had 40 sessions on his throat and swore by nivea cream which he uses on his scar to this day. - not the same as your op I know but I would have thought the skin protection for rads would be similar wherever on the body the rays are directed. Glad to hear though that your second visit was better than the first. hugs xxx",

      "Content": "Hi, It`s a long time since I had a 5 year old but I have a granddaughter that age and was a teacher for many years so have a lot of experience with children. It sounds to me as if your little boy is just frightened and needs lots of reassurance and hugs,  Can you sit down with him and see if he has any questions about things that are worrying him.  He cannot understand what is happening to you only that it makes him feel very insecure and angry and that`s why he lashes out. It is hard to stay patient with him I`m sure when you are so massively stressed yourself but he needs to know that you understand why he is angry and that you love him even when he is naughty. When I was 10 years old my baby brother died and I went through a stage like this, getting into fights etc because I couldn`t handle the grief.  My parents got angry with me as they were grieving and I was making things worse but their anger made me feel as though somehow my brother dying was my fault.  I suffered from depression for years as a result. So, stay patient, lots of cuddles and chats about what is worrying him and maybe give him some special little jobs to do for you so that he feels as though he is part of what is happening and is doing something to help. His behaviour is perfectly normal given the circumstances and he will adjust with your support. I hope this has helped a little.  I really feel for all those of you having to undertake this journey with small children.  I`m finding it tough enough as a 66 year old Grandma so you girls have my admiration. Love and hugs, Mary x",

When it was done he stood back and with tears in his eyes told me I looked like Sinead O`Connor - his all time favourite artist. We`ve been married 42 years and I`m a 66year old Grandma with more than a few wrinkles so I suspected that this wasn`t an entirely accurate description of my new bald look but I loved him for saying it. Fast forward 5 months and yesterday I had my final chemo session. We got home and I went to sit on the terrace in the sun.  Hubby went to the fridge and said , `What do you want to drink, slaphead!!` Rose coloured specs dropped on the floor and ground to pieces underfoot but do you know it lifted my spirits no end.  It wasn`t polite but it was the first flash of his old scouse humour since my diagnosis. Until he said that I hadn`t realised just how much I`d missed the scouse irreverance that usually permeates our relationship and I appreciated how tough the chemo journey has been for him too. My thoughta are with all of you still going through it but it does end and when it does it feels great to have cleared another major hurdle. Love to all you wonderful women in Macland whose love and support have got me this far xx",

There are cups and bottles of water on our lockers when we arrive and they constantly come round to fill them up. They make us drink so much that we often have to be unhooked at the time the bags are changed to visit the loo. I was worried when I saw the nasty red stuff going straight through me and into the toilet but nurses assured me that this was quite normal and to carry on drinking. I drink at least 2 litres on the day prior to treatment and the same for several days afterwards. Still pretty nauseous for about a week but then relatively normal for the rest of the time. Hope the rest of your treatment goes well x",

Mine said she would check to see if the creams she recommended were helping and if not she would give me others to try so I just don`t understand why you aren`t allowed any - it must just be that one doctor. As to male technicians that seems the norm here.  I had males for bone scan, digital x rays andxxx ultrasound with no female presence at all. From what Susie  told me about her bad experience when she went for scan and marking it was 6 men to 1 woman so I`m getting prepared for that.

After surgery and sentinel node removal (negative thankfully) the pathology showed that I was TN. The treatment plan was then altered to include 6 sessions of FEC and I was advised that this was the best option for me because of being unable to have any hormone treatment.  I was told chemo was to kill off any stray cells that had got into the system followed by radiotherapy to prevent any return. I have final FEC on 13th September followed by rads starting 3 weeks later and then as you say I`m out there on my own. I don`t know what they will offer you but I felt accepting the FEC would at least give me some of the protection that I can`t get from hormones and I wanted to throw everything possible at the B*****d.

So typical of Spain - where else would a chemo session be cancelled because it`s the town`s Saint`s day? I do have wonderful friends though and one Colombian friend comes with me to all my appointments to make sure I fully understand all the medical information. The translators in the hospital are great too and visited twice a day when I was in for my lumpectomy in case I needed anything.

Then, this morning I find your post and you sound so happy and I can tell myself that I`ll be in the same place next week.

Oncologist gave me drops known as false tears which were good but I also found a saline solution very helpful and I could use that prior to putting in my daily contact lenses. I didn`t lose eyelashes then and the soreness stopped after the 3rd session.  I have just had my 5th session and my eyebrows and eyelashes started to thin dramatically just a week prior to this. I just have a few very short eyelashes and a tufty bits of eyebrows which is not a great look. Still, like my hair they will grow back and I console myself with the fact that these are signs that the chemo is working and all those evil little cancer cells are being blasted into oblivion. Good luck on your journey x",

      "Content": "Hi Sascha, As you already know I can`t help with the kidney problem but your experience with the Spanish system is similar to mine.  When I saw the surgeon for the post operative appointment he just wanted to hand over my Informe de Alta (description of treatment received and end of his involvement) and answered every question with  \"ask the oncologist\"  - not helpful!! First impressions of the oncologist were good - young, charming, speaks excellent English and I was still in shock about having to have chemo so I didn`t have the questions ready for him.  I had been told when I got the diagnosis that i would need radiotherapy and hormone treatment and only after the op did they discover I was triple negative and  chemo was the only option. At that first appointment I was told just that - chemo + radio or I could walk away and take my chances. I agreed  that I would proceed and was told about other tests I would need - chest x rays, abdominal ultrasound, bone scan etc but that they could happen after chemo had started. Then I was just told to turn up the following Thursday to start treatment. In the week that followed I contacted a fellow sufferer in the UK to find out that she had been talked through the whole process, knew her combination, was given steroids before treatment, had been told about cold cap - the list seemed endless and all things that were never mentioned to me.  Then I joined this group and every day picked up more tips. When I turned up to start the treatment I was well prepared and to give him his due the oncologist answered all my questions but seemed amazed that I wanted to know - apparently the Spanish women in my group just accept that doctor knows best!! I am on 6 cycles of FEC, don`t get steroids beforehand as they are within the treatment and cold cap just doesn`t seem to be an option here.  I still had to come to the Macmillan site to get an understanding of the FEC combination but I feel so much better for having some understanding of what they are giving me. Seems to me that here in Spain we have to fight just that bit harder to get even basic information but I will continue to pester until I get enough facts to enable me to cope. Stay strong and keep fighting until you feel you have the best information available. I don`t feel you should be asked to make decisions about chemo until you`ve seen the kidney specialist in Seville as obviously your local oncologists don`t know anything about your condition. Take care xx",

      "Content": "Hi Sascha, At the very least you should be offered your chemo in the hospital that has the facilities to  cope with complications.  I would insist on this as a prerequisite before even considering having treatment as you can`t afford to take the risk of further damage to your kidney. I was offered the option of going to Malaga for my treatment but opted for the local hospital just to save having a 120k round trip each time. so I know it is possible to have treatment in a hospital other than the one where you had surgery. I know how hard it is to be strong at times like this and these doctors can be so daunting. I took a very good friend to all my appointments as my Spanish isn`t up to dealing with technical information and she was great at arguing on my behalf.  Mind you, she is Colombian and very vocal!!  Do you have anyone who could help you in this way? Thinking of you and sending love xx",

I might have a head of stubble by then but Manchester is cold and it might keep me warm. I had purple streaks to cover some of my grey ones and I loved them so can I throw purple into the suggestion box - in fact get a few colours and ring the changes according to mood.

      "Content": "Hi, I had my third FEC almost 4 weeks ago and it took 8 attempts to get a blood sample that didn`t coagulate.  After the 7th try they gave up and tried my left hand - the operation side - which they weren`t happy about but even the nurses were getting desperate and I was in tears.  Once the blood sample was declared ok and the infusions started my arm went bright red and started to swell so I was given ice packs and they rubbed in hydrocortisone cream. I continued this when i got home and every day since have used a cream called Thrombocin here in Spain. My arm was black from wrist to armpit and even now I can`t straighten it  without a lot of pain. I`ve had an extra week of recovery this time as last Thursday was a local Saint`s day so the clinic was closed  (only in Spain !!!) but am due to have number4 tomorrow.  I am dreading it as my veins seem to have disappeared completely from my right hand.  I asked about a chest line but my oncologist seems very reluctant to put one in. Still, it is very reassuring to come on here and realise you aren`t alone.  Thanks all of you for th different bits of advice and good luck to all of you sharing this horrible journey.",

      "Content": "Hi Amanda, Like you my hair started to on day 14 after first FEC and my scalp felt as if someone was sticking needles in it.   I got my husband to shave off what was left on day 20, put on a pretty scarf and went out for lunch with friends. The scalp was still a bit sore as the roots were still there but  they rubbed off very soon and then I was quite comfortable. I`m so glad I went out with friends straight away as I didn`t have time to get self conscious about wearing a scarf and the positive reaction from my friends made it so much more bearable. Am now only a couple of days away from my final FEC and have progressed to going around our urbanisation (I`m in Spain) without my scarf as the heat and humidity made even a scarf very uncomfortable. Losing your hair is a big deal but you will adapt very quickly and loads of the lovely women on here seem to have great fun choosing wigs and trying new styles so try to see it as a chance to try all those new looks that you like the look of. Good luck for the rest of your journey x",

      "Content": "Hi Ali, Oh, this did strike a chord with me. I don`t finish my rads until early November but have already booked a trip to South Africa for next Easter.  My 2 brothers are keen wildlife photographers and I am an enthusiastic amateur so each year we go on a photographic safari with our partners. I got back from this years trip (to Kenya)  to find the appointment for my routine mammogram waiting for me.  The rest is history!!   The b*****d BC has robbed me of a trip to the UK to see my Grandchildren, I had to pass on all my Olympics tickets to family members, the family cancelled their planned visit when I was too ill after chemo to cope with them, and I missed a reunion with old college friends of my hubbie`s so I felt it had taken enough. Conferred with my brothers, we chose our destination, The Kruger National Park, and we booked.  Ever since I have worried about tempting fate!  I cannot get insurance until treatment is finished ( have you found a company that will accept you?)  but we have had to pay our deposit to secure the booking so I worry that I have rushed into this and risk losing money as well as having panic attacks with every twinge in case it means the cancer has come back. This was supposed to give me a boost but has increased my stress levels, especially as I feel I would be letting down 5 other people if I get ill again.   So, I know exactly how you feel, your head tells you that you are being ridiculous but in the long lonely hours of the night  all these fears surface.  But, we can beat them! We have to tell ourselves that we deserve these treats, we`ve been through enough and we`ve had the best possible treatment so we`ve kicked BC into the garbage where it belongs. Your post makes me realise that we all feel like this, it is natural after what we`ve suffered this year so from today I`m going to start looking forward to my trip and I`m going to start by ordering a new camera as soon as I`ve posted this. Enjoy your trip and see it as a very positive statement that you are a survivor and that life is to be lived to the full.   Love, Mary x",

The scream thread expressed so much of what I was feeling but couldn`t express and people who don`t like it can just delete it! I think a lot of people don`t realise how isolated we feel having our treatment in a country where we have no BC nurses and in my case where my language skills are not sufficient to get through appointments without relying on strangers to translate for me. You have made my journey so much easier to bear. Big hugs xx",
