      "Content": "I've found M&S post surgery bras the most comfortable for day wear. They do a lovely twin pack of one black and one teal. For nightwear I sleep in a padded crop top that I already had from New Look sports section. I was given a bra from hospital (private rather than NHS) which fastens at the front. Make is Amoena style Frances. I still use this at night alternating with the crop top. It was really good for for few weeks post lumpectomy when arm movement a bit limited. It is suitable to use post mastectomy too as it has pockets for silicon inserts.  I'm 5 weeks post surgery and still find I need to wear something to sleep in as breast feels too sensitive directly against pjs. Good luck with your operation. Pam x",

      "Content": "@Ginacarla @Aspen I'm based in Fife but due to have treatment at Western in Edinburgh soon. I've attended Maggie's centre in Victoria hospital site in Kirkcaldy and found everyone really welcoming and supportive. I've attended a few of the classes they run - walking group, relaxation and the Look Good Feel Better class Aspen mentioned which is really good. I looked up the Maggie's at Western and they have similar schedule of events each week. I'm going to look at walking group and yoga sessions they run to help get fitter now I'm passed surgery and chemo. Just radiotherapy to go now.  I'm currently off work so could meet up when over at Western. Send friends request to keep in touch. I'm ahead of you guys in treatment as diagnosed last Sept and happy to support you through this rollercoaster. Pam xx",

      "Content": "I had my last T part of chemo last Wed so still getting through this last cycle. I too had very little side effects from FEC and was worried what T would bring as heard a lot about the T Truck hitting. I have to say it hasn't been too bad. I'm getting aching limbs from day 3 or 4 but helped with Gabapentin painkillers which are good for controlling the nerve pain. I just had to adjust when to take them to get the best night sleep. Nothing worse than nerve pain in night and then cant get back off to sleep. Hot baths also help.  So don't worry you can cope with T cycles too. Good luck for Wed #Aspen.  Pam x",
