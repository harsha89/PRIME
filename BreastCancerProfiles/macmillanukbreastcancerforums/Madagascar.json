      "Content": "Thanks for yr reply...ive only had a week to think about it really so not much time.....i like my breasts & dont want to lose them but it may give me piece of mind of the chances of the cancer not returning and not having to start the treatment again..... Ive been very lucky so far with treatment, pain etc. The surgeon keeps telling me that itsa massive operation with more risks & complications. ",

I could have radiotherapy then wait but it makes the operation more risky later on .",
