    "Content": "Just been diagnosed with breast cancer again after 14 years clear. My first cancer treatment was in 2001 & then again in 2005. The first time I underwent lumpectomy, chemo, & radio therapy, the secondÂ time Igot away with a lumpectomy, other breast. I am awaiting further test results but know I am facing at least a single mastectomy. I\u2019m feeling very unsure about the future at the moment. Any tips?",
