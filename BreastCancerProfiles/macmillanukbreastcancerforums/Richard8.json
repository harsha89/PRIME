      "Content": "Hi Judi This is a common response and the recommendation to continue existing skin care management (usually aqueous cream) doesn't relieve redness and soreness like yours. The nurses know this but still keep recommending it.....why? cost! You can get a new cream especially for radiation/chemo skin reactions....it's called RaLife cream or in a lotion. Some hospitals have started to prescribe but its not wide spread yet as its new. Hope that helps. R x",

      "Content": "Hi Elldee Its really common that nails stay brittle and sore for months after the end of chemo (specially tax). Google some new drops especially developed for chemo nail probs called OnicoLife. (http://mosaiclife.co.uk/symptoms/nails/onicolife-drops). There is also a gel if you get splitting skin on your fingertips.....best wishes R xÂ ",
