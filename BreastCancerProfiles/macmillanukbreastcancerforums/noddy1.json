      "Content": "Hi Pat Sorry i did not reply earlier my computer is down so had to wait to use one I found the third week the most noticable , my head was sore and as i ran my fingers through it it was coming out  and yesterday as i blow dried my hair there was a pile by my feet and as i looked around my hair was everywhere i had been, so that was it , i got the clippers and went for it . I feel much better as my hair was so thin i could'nt do anything with it anyway , i go for my second chemo  tomorrow and im seeing my oncologist today so i thought ive got to face people may as well do it now. I am sure you will be ok for the wedding as mine really didnt do anything noticable until this week . I know what you mean about the control it has over us all my time seems to be ruled by appointments and injections , thats why i did my hair as i felt a had just abit of control over that ,i dont have a wig just hats, i have alot of animals and they dont judge so that makes life easier. Hope this helps How are you feeling after your chemo ? Claire x",
