      "Content": "I went for my routine appointment on Wednesday and was told because I have pain I need a Bone Scan. Unfortunatley I have been googling and had a shock when I found out I could have a secondary cancer in the bone.  I am in shock and don't know what to do as my appointment maybe about 5 weeks away. I don't want to bother my daughters as one is just about to start a new job although she did say if she could she would come with me to the appointment, but the other daughter has a son who is going to have surgery on his head shortly and we are all concerned about him, so she doesn't need any more pressure put onto her. I don't know who to talk to though and am feeling rather low and tearful at the moment. Can anyone advise me",
