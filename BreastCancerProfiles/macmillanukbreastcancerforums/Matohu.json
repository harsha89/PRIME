What are your experiences?",

To family and friends it\u2019s done, over and completed.... I\u2019m cured!! Yay, I feeel the same but now battling the radiotherapy fatigue, although my husband and kids have been so supportive, I feel like they\u2019re now saying get on with it\u2019!! You\u2019re finished treatment (despite me leaving the leaflets lying around) I'm knackered, physically and mentally drained (although in the grand scheme of things, extremely lucky) I know I should be grateful, but actually feel really angry at them for being so dismissive, feelinng apprehensive now as my next appointment isn\u2019t until April 2019.... ive been so thankful to come on here and have a look around at other people\u2019s journeys, I know mines been short but nevertheless one is never envisaged taking... all the best to each and every one of you xx ",
