      "Content": "Hi Jane, glad things have gone well for you! I wonder if I can ask some advice re blue dye after wle & sentinel node biopsy? A leaflet I was given says it colours urine & tears, but when does this usually happen? I had my op 24 hours ago & haven't seen any dye yet & keen to get my contact lens in. So keen to know timeframe for it.  Great effort with your exercises, thanks for the reminder too, early start gives best results   Take care!",

      "Content": "Hiya Phaedra, Firstly, well done you for reaching the end of the marathon of BC I finished chemo 18th May & rads 5 weeks later, hurray hurray. Pass that bell to ring, I would ring it with gusto now!!!! I was too shy & still self conscious on the actual day though. I still have herceptin, muga scans, aromatise inhibitor (extremestane) & 4weekly Zoladex implants... BUT I did the tough stuff & that's over I bounced physically after it ended, walked more, yoga, felt fatigue fading by the week. Holiday, started having sec again...... feeling normal. Chemo brain reduces week on week & I have a sense of fun again (when my mood swings are having a day off ) in short I LOVE LIFE AGAIN!!!  Emotionally, I show my feelings much more readily, like I've had a glass of wine, which my family find amusing, but I quite like this new courage I have. I have had a few infections recently. None during chemo, even though I worked in a busy office throughout my treatment. So maybe my immune system is still below par....... or maybe I just caught the bugs, same as my colleagues did.  My only concern post treatment is not overdoing it -boom & busting - now I have energy to do more, it's exciting & I want to do everything. But weekly massages at Cancer Care are excellent & give me a little reminder that I did have cancer (plus my 1\" hair under the bandanas of course) & I need to still be loving & compassionate to myself, another new skill Iam cultivating. This is my experience of post treatment.  In short.... we are all different & unique. Celebrate your demanding treatment has ended & go with your own experience.... it's all normal. Wishing you a happy & healthy future  xx",

      "Content": "Hi, As soon as my brows grew back I did a Eyelure dye on them, which looked good. Still bits missing, but I had a shape to hang by Wonderbrow on. My eyebrows are not even, only a few mm out with one slightly higher, so quirky, but microblading, which I considered, would have given me problems with re growth above/below the tattoo. A friend had it done pre chemo and hers look fab. Just a point to consider. A x",

      "Content": "Hello!  Sorry to hear you are feeling worried again, that's the worst part isn't it? I just thought I would let you know I had a hysteroscopy & biopsies & it honestly was okay, once I relaxed my knees that was :-)  It was only a very slight discomfort as the biopsies were taken, like a sharp period pain, but over in less than 1 minute, so very doable. I know we are all different, but I am finding I am stronger than I ever imagined & can tolerate more that I would have thought pre BC. I bet you have found these inner reserves too, that's the plus side of this journey, which Iam just beginning, so grateful for this site!! It's also a good day for me today, very positive & feeling I can manage it, which always helps dilute the  panic 'it's bloody awful' days. I have finally had my op - wle & sentinel node biopsy, thank goodness!!  Whatever you need to get through this blip, ask for, including support!!  It is reassuring to know you are being taken care of though & all things are being investigated properly, which is what you deserve.   Wishing you well, take care X",
