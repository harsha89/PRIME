    "Content": "Hi  have not been on site for a while , finished chemo in July etc and am now on herceptin.  my life long friend who was diagnosed with cancer (melanoma) died this week, we were both diagnosed at the same time.  it has made me realise how lucky i am to be here and fighting to keep the cancer away.  it is an up hill struggle and there are times when i wonder if i will get through it.  i have a lot of joint pain and the hot flushes are very frequent and keep me awake most of the night.  my oncoligist has recomended 'anti depressants' which i do not wan to take. is anyone else on herceptin and do they have an helpfull tips. ?",
