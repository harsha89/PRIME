      "Content": "Hi Phaedra Well done and glad your daring to bare! My hair started coming out on day 12 and my scalp was so sore. Shaved the lot off the next day and apart from the initial shock in the mirror it felt so much better. Went out last week with friends, shopping etc and it felt quite liberating. Had some supportive smiles. Can't cope with hats when it's hot so I know I wouldn't suit a wig. Just had second chemo yesterday so feeling grim today but booked a week away in 2 weeks to look forward to and to help break up the monotony. Hope you are coping well. Take care xxx",

I use the night cream mixed with a tiny drop of the green oil that they sell and my skin has never been better!! It's actually improved. You can buy it online. Costs abit more but lasts ages.

I'm proud to be bald and showing the world that life goes on during cancer and whilst in chemo. If people dont like it tough. Had mostly positive looks and support. I too have a very shiny head lol. In some ways I'm going to miss my bald head!  Xx",

Both had amazing curly hair when it grew back but after a year they now have completely straight hair. One has very thick  hair in an amazing shade of trendy grey, the other has very fine light brown hair.  However I have heard of people who keep the curls. Varies for everyone I believe. Xxx",

I can cope with all the niggly things but some symptoms have been so overwhelming this time. I just feel much weaker this time which has been abit of a shock! Paula xx",

      "Content": "Hi all, this is my first post. Found reading all the other posts helpful and inspirational. I got diagnosed in April this year after having pain in my breast which GP thought was a cyst. Cyst was removed, 5cm tumour grade 3 underneath. Oestrogen positive. Had lumpectomy and I am now in the middle of 6 cycles of EC90 to be followed by radiotherapy and drug treatment. First cycle of chemo - 1st 5 days rubbish, lost all my hair on 12th day, next 2 weeks ok. 2nd cycle - 7 days dreadful, 2 weeks ok but tired, Now on 3rd and it's my 10th day and feeling awful. Dreading the 4th! Anyone else had similar build up of symptoms? Also finding it impossible to sleep at the moment. Good luck to everyone, I think you're all amazing xx",

      "Content": "Hi Dreamthief Thank you. I'd not spotted the monthly chemo club threads. Nausea, sweating and then feeling clammy and faint, weird 'out of it' feeling, funny mouth and taste, fatigue to name a few. Mainly side effects like I've had before but more intense and longer lasting. All seems a lot worse during the night. I'm usually fairly positive about it all and just get on with it - job done so to speak. Maybe it's the lack of sleep!  Take care Px",
