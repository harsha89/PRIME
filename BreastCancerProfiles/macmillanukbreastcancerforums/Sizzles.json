      "Content": "Morning All!  I\u2019m seven sessions into a twelve week Taxol treatment plan. Having thought I was very nearly there they\u2019ve paused on my next round of chemo due to some of the neuropathic side effects that are now taking hold of my hands and feet.  There\u2019s talk of only doing nine sessions rather than the originally planned twelve. I\u2019m finding this difficult to  accept as physiologically I want to complete the course. I\u2019d feel somewhat defeated if I had to hang my boots up now (I hope I don\u2019t sound too mental).  Anyone else been in the same boat?  X",

      "Content": "Thank you both so much for your replies, really helpful. I saw the oncologist last night and he want to press ahead with two more sessions and then review again. I am now at total ease with the idea of finishing chemo when he calls time as I\u2019m now terrified about having long term neuropathy. I\u2019m only 37 years old and have two very small children, so I will do whatever I can to get back to normal family life.  Thank you Ruby Rose for sharing your situation and I\u2019m sorry that you have to endure the symptoms that you do. Always inspired by the bravery of people like yourself.  Keep smiling ladies, we\u2019ve got this! x",
