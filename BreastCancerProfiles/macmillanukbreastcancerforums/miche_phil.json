      "Content": "Thank you GRANNY59, I am probably reading more into this than what is actually needed and had told myself the same thing, that they just want to be extra thorough. It's been a wee bit of a shock from thinking it was a wee fatty lump to then be getting biopsy at the ultrasound. Then this. Keeping everything crossed that it's still a wee fatty lump with all clear fibrous to see at the next appointment. Thank you for replying. Never done this before.",

      "Content": "Hi There, I am brand new to all of this and feeling a little concerned. I found a lump just before Christmas. To me it felt like a fatty lump. Got appointment for Gp inbetween Christmas and New year. Gp said she thought it was mostly a fatty lump but sending me to breast clinic as routine since it's boobs. Had my appointment a week past on Saturday and the consultant was quite sure it was a fatty lump but sent for ultrasound. Ultrasound took longer than I anticipated as it was a fatty lump at the front but showing dark mass behind it. After several photos taken I had a biopsy. I had 3. Not sure how many is normally taken. After this I was as you can imagine a bit overwhelmed but so glad I had my hubby with me. Went back for results of ultrasound to the consultant who told me that he thought it was glandular something? Which is fibrous tissue and almost always is nothing to worry about. Phoned up yesterday for my results and the nurse said my biopsy was clear, but I had a letter on the way as they wanted to see me again to re-check and a possible further biopsy. Just wondering if this has happened to anyone else and if anyone can tell me why they would want to re-check and possibly do another biopsy if the original one was clear. Sorry for the long winded story, but feeling a little concerned and anxious all over again.",
