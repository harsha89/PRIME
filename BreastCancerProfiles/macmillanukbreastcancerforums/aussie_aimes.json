    "Content": "Hi peeps, I was wondering if I could call on your knowledge for this. I am a chemo newbie (first round was wednesday), and have been on strong antibiotics for two weeks as I had a nasty infection in a seroma in my lymphatic incision where they performed my sentinel node biposy. This infection had already delayed the start of my chemo for a week as I was far too unwell to have chemo. I think prehaps I may have a nasty case of vaginal thrush as a result of the antibiotics and a weakened immune system. Who should be my first port of call regarding this? SHould I contact my GP, Breast care nurse or my Chemotherapy nurse? Would the use of canesten help and could I start treatment right away or should I wait until I have spoken to someone? These things always seem to pop up over the weekend! Big hugs, much love, AA x",
