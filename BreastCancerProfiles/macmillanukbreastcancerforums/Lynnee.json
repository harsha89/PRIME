      "Content": "Hi Sorry to hear this, try and keep strong and positive,  I know it is hard when all you want to do is cry but I am sure it helps. Just had the last drain removed this morning after 9 days and it feels so much better and can walk around freely without being pulled back by it! Just got to wait another week for the axillary clearance results and the rest of my treatment.  Sending you cyber hugs and lots of best wishes",

      "Content": "Hi Marielouise I was diagnosed with tubular breast cancer in November 2013 in my right breast,  I had the lump removed via WLE in January.  It has not spread to the lymph nodes so will need radiotherapy on this sometime as I was also diagnosed with invasive ductal in my left breast and this had reached the lymph nodes. I had an axillary clearance on the 26th March and will get the results of this on 10th April to see what comes next. I am ttrying to be strong and positive through this but sometimes just want to curl up into a ball and cry. The waiting for the results seems to be the worst part.  Hope this helps, sending you lots of best wishes Lynnee xxx",

      "Content": "Hi Hally It is definitely the waiting that is getting me down and the fact that I am still in a lot of pain and discomfort from the clearance last week,  I could feel the 2 lumps jn my left breast but the surgeon said  I would never have found the one in my right as it was really deep, this was the one diagnosed as tubular. which was certainly more scary and only found via the mammogram.  Hope all goes well tomorrow,  let me know how you get on.
