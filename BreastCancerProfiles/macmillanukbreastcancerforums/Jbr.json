      "Content": "Hi ladies It is an ongoing nightmare. Apparently accord and actavis are merging so these brands will be one and the same. Sandoz is definitely over but I was fortunate as my chemist managed to get four months supply just before it became official so I figured I had time to fight my cause after dr reddy caused swelling and increased joint pain in just one day and actavis an upset stomach. Visited my GP who has agreed for me to try Femura! But she expects a backlash from LHA! Also have just started taking sandoz at night rather than in the morning and definitely less aches and pains but also started on the Clarytyn about 10 days ago so could be that. ( with all the midge bites it is quite useful ATM anyway).I take oxybutin and gabapentin for flushes and they are bearable now plus a few other joint supplements and vitamin D. If I can stay as I am then I can cope. My SE seem to come and go in waves and a pharmacist friend said it is just how your body is coping at the time. I think he is right as i seem to get them all together - flushes/joint pin/ mood swings or hardly any at all. I am hoping that the femura may enable me to reduce some of the other tablets and less visits to the GP etc so may be more economical in the long run. The price difference is however unbelievable.  I have been pretty relentless on it all but at the end of the day we need to be the best we can be in our situations. Have also had low white blood count from recent blood test which GP picked up on but this is mentioned in Femura trials as another unexplained SE. Weirdly the first blood test when I was having a bad week was lower than the second taken the other day whilst I was on a much more even keel. I do also recommend as much exercise as you can manage. Keep going ladies and wishing you all the Best on your own individual journeys. ",

      "Content": "Hi Good luck with the Dr Reddy's, I am sure you will be fine but this brand does seem to be one that can cause significant joint pains but then there must be 1,000's of women taking it who are fine. Just remember if it doesn't suit you then you do have alternatives. Hugs  ",

      "Content": "Hi Yme Good news on day one, long may it continue. Following my dexa scan I did not need to take calcium as my bones were ok despite my advancing years! However the oncologist said to take vitamin D ( in fact he thinks everyone should take it and certainly in winter). I also am quite active so had already dipped in and out of the supplement route but now religiously take a turmeric and glucosamine combo, along with krill oil and vitamin b - which was recommended by a friend who has also had breast cancer. This obviously comes at a financial cost but I can still cycle, jog do my yoga and walk in the mountains. In fairness I have taken these from day one so can't say 100% that they help, however I do think that taking the letrozole at night is better for me.  Wishing you a SE free journey, keep in touch with your progress.
