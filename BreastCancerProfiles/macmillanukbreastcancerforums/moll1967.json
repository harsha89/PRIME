      "Content": "Hi, I have had a WLE in March which included a Axillary Node clearance, 1 node out of 11 cancerous. I have just finished FEC-T chemo and due to start 30 Rads on 20th October and also tamoxifen. I read lots of ladies posts here who have had other scans whereas I have had none, only a chest xray and that was because I was admitted with infection during chemo and they were checking for chest infection. When I asked my Oncologist about further scans to check to see if it had spread she said I didn't need them due to my results being what they were and having chemo and rads. Having now finished my chemo I feel scared, my safety net has gone and the what ifs are buzzing round my head. Should I push for further scans, is it normal not to have scans?",

You are not irrational at all, I finished my chemo 3 weeks ago and I feel the same, safety net gone, I do have radiotherapy to come and hormone treatment to come but its scary. Hope you can find the article and it helps you a little x",

      "Content": "I had a PICC line inserted after my first chemo and I am so pleased I did, I didn't find the insertion painful, slightly uncomfortable but so worth it as I didn't have to have anymore needles for bloods or chemo which was such a relief for me, especially as I ended up being admitted twice during chemo so lots of extra bloods taken and intravenous antibiotics all administered by my PICC! The only issues I had was that my skin reacted to the dressings but they used different ones and all ok. The line has to be flushed and dressed weekly and I had a choice of district nurse or going into chemo unit and I think some folk look after it themselves. I would definitely recommend one to you, good luck with whatever u decide xx",

Also have varicose vein pain which I didn't have before chemo, well I had the varicose veins but they weren't painful just occasionally itchy. I am 3 weeks through a 6 weeks weeks of Rads and Doc has suggested if pain no better after rads finished I should go back and discuss. I have tried to keep so upbeat about my treatment so far and have largely, with a few wobbles, managed it but i feel so exhausted and low that I'm beginning to struggle :(",
