      "Content": "Hi Dolina and Julia I just wanted to say I'm feeling exactly the same, having also had a mastectomy in June, and no you're not going mad.  I read the link Julia posted and found it very helpful; I've saved it and will keep going back to  it. For me, as it outlined in the article, my experience was made worse by administrative errors and lack of communication, seeing 3 different consultants and 3 different breast care nurses. Having expected chemo and radio, I'm just on Letrozole, so the end came unexpectedly suddenly and I'm struggling to come to terms with it all.  I too relive horrible moments.  The article talks about the 'extraordinary' nature of these events and how it's unreasonable to expect to 'move on'.  We have to be kind to ourselves and accept that some days are very hard. Love and hugs, Vikki xxx",
