      "Content": "Hi Emma, I've been on tamoxifen since December and I can relate to your troubles. I also suffered badly with hot flushes and it woke me up a lot. But I've tried acupuncture on the Dr.advice and can honestly say, it is getting so much better. So far I've had 4 sessions, you are adviced to get 6-8 sessions weekly and see how it goes. But I can barely notice it now and don't wake up as much as before, it's definitely working. Give it a go. regards Jana",
