      "Content": "Hi Jsteph I had DIEP in March last year. I am really pleased with the result! I remember when I came round from the op and had a peek I thought I looked exactly the same as before which was great. I was 4 days in hospital which was fine as I was very well looked after.  The main thing is being quite restricted for a week or two afterwards. We had a freezer full of dinners cooked by my Mum and a friend which made life easier. Also it was actually quite nice to just lay in bed or on the sofa watching TV, reading etc. I only needed paracetamol & ibuprofen once home and only for a few days. It\u2019s important to do all the physio exercises as best you can it won\u2019t be long before you notice improvements. Good luck and let us know when you have a date. Annjac ATB for Wednesday, look forward to hearing from you afterwards!",

All I have to add is some buttercups from yesterday, they cheered me up as it was very dull.   Hopefully we can all dodge the storms over the weekend and get out a bit, enjoy whatever nature has to offer wherever you are. Have a lovely weekend and keep sharing the pics!",

I have not posted for ages but I have found huge comfort and support from reading all your messages, thank you.  When it all kicked off I knew that walking and being outside would benefit me all the way through, I love nature and take joy from the most simple things I see and hear whilst out in the countryside. When I went for surgery I made sure I had taken some pics of my favourite places and views to give me good thoughts whilst so restricted and uncomfortable.  I was so pleased within a week or so to be able to go out again and experience it all for real. Even in the snow!  Here is a pic from today\u2019s walk, a promising prospect! Amalie xx",

Moomy also well done for nude yoga!  I try and do a bit of yoga every morning in between the shower and getting dressed. The pic is of a globe artichoke in the garden. It grows a fair amount of globes but they are very small and all ways covered in black fly we\u2019ve never been able to eat one. The colour is so vibrant!

She is looking into the effects of exercising in different temperatures for women who have had BC compared with women that haven\u2019t.  It\u2019s quite interesting, I had all sorts of things stuck on me to examine the composition of my sweat, my skin temp, my core temp (via a probe/cable up my jacksy) plus breathing into a tube and bag every 4 minutes.  Weighed, measured, urine sample. Got to go back twice more, next time I think is only 25 degrees. I am defers going for a nice countryside walk tomorrow whatever the weather!",

I had to wait a while and got tears in the waiting room, then when I saw the registrar I was quite weepy, I was so embarrassed. She was lovely, I tried to explain that it was just being back at the hospital even though my experience there had been really positive and I was very pleased with everything they have done.

I left it till this evening so it was cooler, it\u2019s not a pleasant job but very satisfying and it gives them a chance to run about in the garden for an hour or so which is good.

Get this, last Tuesday a close colleague went off sick, she had some symptoms and generally felt unwell. Fast forward to this Tuesday, admitted to hospital and diagnosed with Bile Duct Cancer which has made her liver go into failure. She discharged herself last night, waiting to hear what they can offer which will probs be palliative care.  WTF? She is a lovely lady, just turned 59 and optimistic about making positive changes to her life in her 60th year. I\u2019m her supervisor and we have become quite close over the last few months, she has shared a lot with me and I have huge respect for her. Soz to share this, still trying to comprehend and process it all.  Went to see her in hospital yesterday with my manager then we went back to the office and had to tell everyone.  I am blessed to have such a good team, we are all comfortable to share tears and hugs when necessary. Its reinforced my belief in making each day the best experience it can be, whatever you are doing. Making sure there is something enjoyable regularly enough to keep a good balance and enhance wellbeing. Fucking canccer. Anyways I\u2019ve had a quiet day thinking about her and had a good walk which was a tonic.",

      "Content": "Hi Howaboutthat  I had DIEP recon last year and I am really pleased with the result. Have since had nipple recon and tattoo done.  A big factor with DIEP is recovery time and the limitations for the first couple of weeks. I was 4 nights in hospital and only needed paracetamol and ibuprofen when I came home. You can\u2019t drive for 4 weeks and you are restricted with your movements and lifting/carrying things etc.  I just gave into it, had a lot of sofa and TV time!",

      "Content": "Morning Howaboutthat My new breast feels fairly natural though there is a hard lump on the underside, which interestingly always feels a bit warmer than the rest of the area. I don\u2019t have much sensation either, when I had the nipple recon I didn\u2019t need any anaesthetic as I couldn\u2019t feel anything. I\u2019ve never had any pain since the original scars healed. The surgeon was very clear with me that the aim of the surgery is to provide a new \u2018breast shape\u2019 that would give symmetry and look OK in clothing and swimwear.  This is exactly the result and if anything I now have a better body shape because of the tummy tuck. Good luck with your decision.",

      "Content": "Hi all im all over the place this last couple of weeks with my emotions, mostly fine but easily burst into tears and feeling sad. It can happen anytime. Generally I\u2019m fine when with others (and all my family & friends have been lovely) it\u2019s other times when I\u2019m on my own probably just thinking about ME ME ME because I\u2019m geting better at that. I\u2019m aware my situation could be much worse and I am recovering well from my surgery (mx & DIEP). In fact everything at this stage is as good as it could be I think I\u2019m just realising something big has happened and I am still adjusting to it. im starting counselling next week with a local charity who support people living with cancer hopefully it will help me process all this. Also I don\u2019t mind what is going on, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a natural part of the process and healthy to express it.  When you can\u2019t or don\u2019t want to share moments like this with others in your life this forum is a great place to do so. Thank you all for helping me feel part of something and not alone with it... Onward and upward (and every which way it takes us)...",

      "Content": "Hi Sweendog I really feel for you having to deal with all this being so young, bless you. I had a right mastectomy and reconstruction using tummy tissue just over 2weeks ago. I\u2019ve never had any surgery before, nor been in hospital so I was quite apprehensive and unsure what to expect. All the staff, surgeon and anaesthetists were so respectful and reassuring I felt in very good hands. With mine they removed the nipple and cut a slightly larger hole around the area. They used the hole to take all the breast tissue out and put the new tissue in. When I came round from the op I was nervous about having a look, but when I saw what they had done I was amazed! I look exactly the same as I did before (sisters not twins) the work is very neat and I am really pleased with my decision.  I had 3nights in hospital and I\u2019m doing well, haven\u2019t really had pain just some discomfort at times. Doing all the physio exercises fine. Had the wounds checked Monday everything is clean and mending well. I feel good in myself, the main issue is being slow and tired. Have to take life at a much slower pace and needing a lot of quiet/down time.  I\u2019m 47 and not had children, got small boobs. This next stage will be a big time for you, good to be asking about it and give yourself time and space to process all the information, it\u2019s quite overwhelming so it\u2019s good to have a few weeks to get your head round it all. I hope your experience is as positive as mine (and many others) has been, no reason you won\u2019t be pleased with the results. Take care Amalie",

They were all quite small. Good news is they removed them all with a good margin so the cancer is gone, also at surgery they checked my lymph nodes and they were all clear. I don\u2019t have a nipple at the moment which is really the only weird thing about it. I can get a nipple reconstruction further down the line which I probably will.

My surgeon was very clear that the purpose of the surgery was to deal with the breast disease and give symmetry/good appearance in clothing. I am really pleased with how I look in clothes and swimwear, better than before as I did have a bit of a tummy!  My new boob is smaller than it\u2019s sister and a bit hard but no-one would know except me and my OH. Incidentally he was amazed with what a good job the surgeons did. I am going back to see him next week and will probably arrange to have a nipple reconstruction. The hardest part for me was the initial 2 weeks after surgery. I wasn\u2019t in pain, just discomfort but quite restricted and very tired. So if you can plan for this, download some box sets, get some dinners in the freezer and take up offers from friends to help with cleaning, shopping etc it will all help you. Good luck!",

In the alcove are some book shelves and I came across a small tatty book: Quiet Corner by Patience Strong. I flicked through and here it is Comfort (1937) When the soul is plunged into the depths of dark despair When the heart is heavy with its load of human care When it seems that we shall never see the light again Blinded by our sorrows, the tear drops and the pain That\u2019s the time when unseen hands reach down to take our own Loved ones press around us though we think we stand alone Angel wings enfold us safe from every hurt and harm Something seems to come to us and make us strong and calm Comfort steals upon the heart, we know not how or why Suddenly the light comes flooding o\u2019er the darkened sky \u2018God shall wipe away all tears\u2019 - this promise shall remain And strengthened, healed and comforted, we face the world again. I hope you like it Have a good day everyone",
