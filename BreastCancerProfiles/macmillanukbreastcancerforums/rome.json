      "Content": "Hi Cathy, I hope you sort it out it's worrying enough returning to work after time off,and you would like to think that your employer would make it easier for you.  I am returning on Monday and asked my employer if I could come back on a phased return like you and they said not unless my doctor or consultant has advised it is that the norm that you have to go to your doctor first as I haven't a clue in these things and am dreading Monday. Good luck Rome  ",
