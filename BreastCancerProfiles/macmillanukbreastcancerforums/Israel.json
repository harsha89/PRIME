      "Content": "Hi Sunflower76 . Thanks for posting this! I\u2019m always amazed at how different and how similar we all can be.Ive had a similar journey to you and I\u2019m 1 week post Rads. Side effects for me are minimal, nothing a bit of moisturiser cannot control .tamoxifen triggered the collywobbles in me as I have had migraines since a child and extremely sensitive to hormone changes! BUT I take it in evening and all is good; I\u2019ve been on it for 2 months approx no side effects at all, which is brilliant. the more I read your post it kept thinking is this about how our experiences have totally shaken up our values and life goals? Having had  a cancer diagnosis can kind of wake you up and see things through new filters , it certainly changed me - we make seem the same to others but how can we be? May sound totally whacky but perhaps you are on the move girl! Maybe you have some ideas to chew over and give a go, exciting times ahead! ps stamp or slap any demons or suchlike under foot where they belong! As you may have new plans- you just didn\u2019t realise until now! Love to you and everyone in treatment. Looking forward to walking with you xx",

I also had stage one but initially who cares what stage right! It\u2019s cancer. what you\u2019re feeling is totally normal . I hate the way our minds conjure up the worse scenarios! Treatment for this evil critter is developing daily and is totally do- able. My treatment went without any hitches. Work wouldn\u2019t have known because I had radiotherapy before shift and tamoxifen no huge problem. So you can do this, take it one day at a time, look after yourself, ask for support as needed .ive just had my first check up and all clear. I\u2019m sure many will respond this is such an amazingly supportive group. All our journeys are different, so Ask anything, as one of us has probably experienced it too! warm hug and to you  X",

I made sure I got my sleep, moisturised the area well and drink lots of fluids. I was very woried initially about tamoxifen as one side effect may be headaches and ive always had horrendous migraines! But I started to take it at 8pm daily and so far 3 months I do not think it has really effected me..... which is a total miracle I think! So although I totally understand your anxiety do try if you can to take your days as they come- your results were brilliant!! Step by step and huge hugs to you xx",

I\u2019m not sure if one did not have it in the end. I\u2019m guessing there could be lots of reasons , but in the end even though it\u2019s frustrating I\u2019ll rather not have it if I\u2019m getting zapped in the wrong place. Today I felt totally in the wrong place and said but they confirmed it was ok. !  You are totally right about paracetamol it certainly isn\u2019t a tranquilliser ! But having less pain makes sense you may be less tense in your muscles?? hope tomorrow all goes to plan the daily trips are tiring Take care x",

I\u2019m very sensitive to hormone changes, my skin changed so much , hair thinned out and  fell out frequently but I haven\u2019t had chemo, migraines for years, pounds pile on with medications ... But the good news is after taking tamoxifen for over a month I haven\u2019t experienced any obvious side effect which I am soooooo so pleased with. I\u2019ve been fitted with compression sleeve and socks for flights too as a protective factor for flights.  Im holding a stand against any cancer gremlins they have no right to be in our bodies! whatever you decide we will be here for you.  Xx",

But what did come to mind was that it\u2019s good that you have been monitored and the alien has been spotted; also that your Consultant is seeking advice from others who I\u2019m guessing have more knowledge in this specific situation- but in the meantime you\u2019re waiting and that is such a challenge! So good that you have got it out and shared so that we can stand with and support you. There is always someone on this site who  have had similar experiences, so you are not alone - we are all on this journey together, so sending a hug   X",
