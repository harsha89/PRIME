      "Content": "Hi, New to this group and recently diagnosed with stage 2 breast cancer. I am having a lumpectomy on Tuesday and my surgeon has given me 2 options which I have to decide on by tomorrow! One is therapeutic mammoplasty and the other involves a fat graft/ injection to fill the space. Anyone have advice or preference on which I should go for?  Thanks in advance.",
