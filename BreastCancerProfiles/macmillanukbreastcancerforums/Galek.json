      "Content": "Hey there The waiting is horrendous! I was told that I had to wait 6 weeks for a breast clinic appointment even though my doctor sent a rapid response referral through to the hospital.  I was in pieces! I ended up going private, thanks to my company health plan and tfollowing the private clinic appointment, I got referred into the NHS clinic within days for a biopsy.  I'm 6 months down the line and on chemo number 5.  Its been quite a rollercoaster ride and will continue to be so, but the lows are not so frequent now.  I know that chemo is not on the cards for you, but you may be interested in reading my blog. Thinking of you Gale xx",
