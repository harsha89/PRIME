      "Content": "Hi If you have paid into national Insurance then you should be entitled to contributions based Employment Support Allowance. (ESA). I have been iffworksince last april and my ssp has run out . I still have my job technically but am on no pay with the local authority.  I was awarded esa within 3 days of making the vlaim. Go on direct.gov website to look it up. This should help a bit hopefully. Dont rush back to work if uou are going to struggle. I have been diagnosed with osteoarthritis in my wrists. Not sure what the future holds workwise but driving even makes my wrists hurt let alone working on computers each day. Its taken a bit if pressure off having ESA so do apply its not means tested if its contributions based. Good luck  Samantha",

I have just been awarded contributions based ESA to as a  paid employee whose sick pay has run out i am entitled to. McMillan siggested I apply. Its really helpful being Christmas to help pay the bills.  Im learning to be kind to myself and not to rush back to work. Listen to your bidy and ask for whwt you need. Speak to mcmillan helpline for advice if you can as they will tell you your legal position. Good luck Samantha ",

You could also ask with your doctors/consultants supporting letters for you to take early retirement on the grounds of disability. As a cancer sufferer you are covered under the equality bill as a disabled person and youe employer needs to consider your circumstances in view of this. You may need to see someone from occupational health who could complete an assessment.if your circumdtances and then make a reccomendation to your employer based onthe outcome of the assessment.  There is also a helpline if you Google the \"equality and human rights commision\" to help you understand your options.(formerly the disability rights commision) Hope this helps.

Yet I feel this is the area which doesnt get enough of an airing. Its ok.to be scared and to ask for what makes you feel safe again. I would ask for an MRI if you think it will calm your fears.

      "Content": "Hi londonlass and all I was diagnosed in may this year. had a double lumpectomy, rads and on zoladex. onco wants to start me on extremastane too. I feel like an alien in my home as nobody else has been through this. soooooo relieved to see im not going mad or Imagining things.im 49 so drugs have put me into menopausal symptoms by stopping my ovaries from working as oestrogen fed c.  I can add to the list huge anxiety, going out into busy places, going back to work (still off)!  Aching body (yesterday diagnosed with osteoarthritis in my wrist) iron deficiency ( taking tablets for this and anxiety/depression, pain relief.) Kids and second husband freezing while im on fire. Funny - went to my daughters graduation at the weekend in Nottingham. went to her flatmates afterwards for games and drinkie poos. I spent most of the evening hanging out of a third floor flat window. it was raining so hair was soaked bit was so hot I had passed caring. her friends were adorable and just kept asking me answers to the game we were playing and avted as if I was completely normal. bless them.",

      "Content": "Ji tarneh No its not a daft question. Im taking zoladex and now just also started exemastane. I've not been offered a bone density scan either! Im 49 and was still having periods regularly. However dur to having threatened bloodclots in the past my.oncologist has decided I shouldn't take tamoxifen due to slight increased risk of thrombosis. I will ask my.oncologist for one when isee him.in 5weeks time as ive already just been.told ive developed osteo arthritis in my wrist. Good luck. Samantha",

      "Content": "Hi Sorry to hear your suffering on tamoxifen. I haven't been given this as I've had suspicion of blood clots in the past. Tamoxifen has a slightly increased risk I was told. Instead I am on zoladex injections every 4 weeks and take exemastane tablets,daily with adcal tablets(vit d and calcium to protect my bones). However I still ache a lot and now have arthritis in my wrists and finger etc. It has put me into.menopausal symptoms as im just 50 and wasn't there as yet. It may be worth asking for this instead.  Good luck Samantha",
