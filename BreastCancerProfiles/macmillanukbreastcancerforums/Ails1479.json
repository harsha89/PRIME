      "Content": "Hi there, I was very recently diagnosed with BC. Next week I have my surgery. I've been told I'll definately have radiotherapy and there is a strong possibilty I'll have chemo too. The thing is, I don't have any children and my fiancé and I were planning on starting a family imminently before cancer showed up. We have been to our local fertility clinic so everything from that point of view is moving along . I'm not really looking for info on how that process works. I am just interested to hear the stories of women who have been in my situation (without kids), if they are willing to share them. The thought of not ever being able to have kids as a result of chemo is like a  double blow after being told you have cancer at 36. Thanks Ails",
