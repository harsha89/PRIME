      "Content": "Hi everyone, sorry i'm in here, i haven't been diagnosed. I found a dense and quite sore lump on tuesday measuring about 2cm, went straight to the doctors again. It was the same lump she examined before christmas, before christmas it was tiny and she thought it was fibrous tissue clearly not now as it has grown so much from december. Whilst at the Doctor she examined both breasts again and in addition to the lump on my right breast she also found another lump on my left breast which is the same size as the one on the right when it was noticed before christmas. Got referred on Tuesday and received my letter for consultant yesterday. I am so scared, i have 4 children, i'm 31 and i have no idea what to think and to boot my aunt had a double mastectomy plus there is family history of breast Cancer, well i feel absolutely rubbish. I also feel silly because i know there are people in here that actually have cancer and are going through a horrible time so i'm sorry for feeling like a cry baby, just feel quite lost atm x Got to get Genetic testing also and the most horrible thing was during the examination the look on my doctors face was so apologetic, thats what scared me the most and she asked me if I would have a double mastectomy, I think at that point i want to run out of the room. I know I should wait for all the tests, i just wish i could erase seeing the look on my doctors face.  I have less than 2 weeks until the apt, think this is going to be the hardest bit, just waiting. i feel like crying but i don't want the kids to know and last thing i want to do is scare them.  xx",

      "Content": "Hi everyone, Yeah, i think i need to give myself a kick start, trying to get over the shock and today as kids are at school and my wee 2 year old is at day care, i just thought bugger it i'm laying in my bed all day! Yesterday, i was ok, well just made jokes with kids and kept up the usual goings on in our house, making dinner and cleaning up etc, but woke up this morning and just felt horrible. Feel silly for being scared too as I know the success rate is extremely high and I have an excellent diet, i'm young and fairly fit, so it's baffling me why i'm feeling so low. I think i just need a nice warm bath and a good movie. I know i can't pretend it's not happening or ignore it and i know worry is a wasted emotion, i guess it's just the initial shock and this waiting period.  My lump on my right breast is sore also, could whatever it is be pressing on nerves? Also its solid (i should stop pressing it) i keep checking the darn thing, hoping it goes away, guess most people do the same at the start, maybe. I was just wondering if i should go back to the doctor? it's not agony and i guess the pain could be psychological. Definitely worrying too much at the minute, feel quite silly. Thank you so much to all of you for your kind words and support xx",

      "Content": "Hi QuiltMags, Thank you for that. I know everything you are saying is right, i think the most horrible thing is just this waiting about and worrying about my children.  My ex husband is in Australia and has very little to do with my 3 eldest kids, think that is why i'm quite stressed, anyone who knows me knows when i'm stressed, the darn house gets untidy and i can't be bothered to tidy up, usually its spotless, lol, oh well though, got two sick kids today off school so have an excuse and it never ever gets that bad, i just can't stand mess, so going to put on some music and clean up, take my mind off everything. I always feel so much better when things are spotless, think i have OCD when it comes to cleaning,lol just feel clean house, clean mind. I do have a partner, been with him 4 years now, and we have Lachlan our 2 year old, but its really hard to explain how I feel to him, i've tried to talk but I held back, can't really cry in front of him, don't know why, I just cry when i'm on my own, silly.  It definitely scared the life out of me when I seen the look on the Doctors face, normally she is quite monosyllabic, she's a nice woman don't get me wrong but when I had to see her before she was perfunctory, no smiles or anything but last week well as i said the look of compassion and apology on her face, i can't seem to erase that from my mind at all.  I've done a little research and because of my age etc sometimes you can get swellings due to periods etc, so got mine now and hoping and praying maybe the lump will go away after it, i know this is probably not going to be the case but got to remain hopeful. Does anyone else get up every morning and check to see if its still there? I need to stop doing that but its definitely difficult, that and the not sleeping properly etc ahh i know its all just worry. Spoke to my lecturers as i'm doing a masters degree and he has told me to take a break until i find out where i'm at with everything so thank god I don't have to worry about submitting essays etc. So thats good, can concentrate on the kids, so thats really good.  How did your operation go? Is it painful? Have they any idea how long you will have to undergo chemo etc? How are you feeling? Hope you are ok and really glad they got all of the lump out!!! :) thats great news love xxx",

I hope by now you are out of surgery, and they have got all of the lump. Try your best and get plenty of rest and keep hydrated as much as you can.
