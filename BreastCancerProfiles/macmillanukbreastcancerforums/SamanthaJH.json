    "Content": "Hi Leslegs, My mum had her op last year and she found some lovely comfy bras at Peacocks, they were supportive but non-underwired, she said they were exactly what she needed. M&S also do a range of bras for post-surgery too - if you go on to their website and go to Lingerie, Bras, then there are about 10 different post op bras to choose from. Mum didn't try them so I can't say how good they are, but they're worth a look. She also had a heart-shaped cushion which she kept under her arm for ages afterwards, when sleeping or watching TV etc. I'm afraid I don't know where she got it, but if you can get hold of one you'll be so much more comfortable. Best of luck with your op and recovery. Sam x",
