      "Content": "If they give the option then there really is no argument for the chemo, the more you have the greater resistance your body has to it. Should you need it at a future date your chances are vastly improved with first line. If you are concerned about hair loss ask about drug options and as yours is not vital but you choose that route, opt for a drug that doesn't cause your hair to fall out.Â  I chose Carboplatin only which doesn't affect your hair. Good luck with your decision. LA",
