Love them to bits.  I'm interested to hear your feeling a little bit angry.  Me too.  Very unlike me really but I'm snappy, wish I was better able to cope with all this.  My results are due soon too.  I think we're grieving, would you agree?",

      "Content": "My heart goes out to you all. There are so many sad stories on this site I find myself choking back the tears too sometimes.  I'm a newbee to breast cancer awaiting results after my lumpectomy and a month ago I didn't know I had cancer and yet it's already a lifetime. You'll know what I mean.  I wish you all fantastic outcomes and the best of health this new year and I hope you all get peace of mind in the middle of all this. Go forward and try to be strong and you will come out the other side. Huge hugs to you all x",
