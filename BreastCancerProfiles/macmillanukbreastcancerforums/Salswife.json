      "Content": "Hi there. So today my wife had an emergency appointment at he breast clinic. Mammogram, ultra sound then to see the consultant. After ultra sound she ended up having 2 biopsies. One from the breast and the other from the lymph node on the same side as there was swelling. we were told that it looks like breast cancer, she was sorry to have to give us such bad news but wanted to be honest. my wife, Sally, almost cancelled today as it had gone down a lot but I insisted. So you can imagine what an absolute shock this is to us both. She said it was treatable but now I just want to know what grade it is, what\u2019s going to be done etc etc. they said they would call us Wednesday or Thursday to discuss the findings. She said she will know from the biopsy where we stand and an indicator of what treatment. what an awful horrible time this waiting is. clare x",
