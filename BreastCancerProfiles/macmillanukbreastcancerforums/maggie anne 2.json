And am curious to know how big their lump actually was in reality..... In comparison to pea size, mine felt like pebble size!! I stumbled  across it. In hindsight I was bad at checking my breasts or rather I wasn't thorough enough.  On diagnosis it was sized at 35mm but was actually 25mm. Id never had a mammogram before diagnosis as hadn't reached that age. However.... after chemo there was nothing left   Julia x great news Julia,  x",
