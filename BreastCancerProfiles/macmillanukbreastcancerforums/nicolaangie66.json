I'm on Zoladex too due 2nd injection next week and like you I seem to find even trivial things make me want to cry.......Ikea adverts included.....at least we have this great community here to listen to us. Dreamthief is completely right, we are leaking oestrogen and it is giving us these low moods and wobbles. I saw my GP yesterday, she sat and listened to me and said this is all completely normal. I haven't had any balance issues, but have problems putting things in things.....i couldn't put a teabag in a mug, I knew it  had to go in the mug but kept dropping it on the unit, and my washing machine keeps having fabric softener drips down it where i try to pour....really strange.  I hope you start to feel a little better soon but you know where we all are if you need a moan! xx best wishes Nicola ",

      "Content": "Hello Millie, I was the same as you, 1/3 nodes positive this did not show on scan prior to surgery. I had to decide between removal of nodes via surgery or radiotherapy to armpit and collarbone. I opted for the radiotherapy as I had healed nicely from the SNB surgery. I was very much steered towards radiotherapy by my oncologist who gave me the statistics surrounding surgery vs radiotherapy. I accepted the radiotherapy and now have 4 sessions left of 23. Phew! However, if you do opt for radiotherapy, please ask that they cover the whole armpit area, they have only covered half my armpit, the radiotherapy causes slight darkening of the skin and I can see only half my armpit has been 'zapped' which is slightly concerning. In hindsight, maybe I should have been more assertive during my onco appointment and pushed to have the nodes removed, and I shall be bringing my half zapped armpit issue up at my next appt. Sending you very best wishes and good luck with what you decide Nicola xx",

      "Content": "Hello All, I am 1 year post diagnosis, and have just had 1 year mammogram and am awaiting results as found another lump in May. Surgeon thinks it is scar tissue  and also says I have lymphoedema in my affected breast and arm. There is currently a 5 week wait here in Cornwall for mammogram results.....yikes!!! My question is, in April this year I had to have my gall bladder removed and since then have been suffering with chronic diarrhoea as I am producing too much bile. GP is now looking into this as still getting a lot of pain and loosing weight. Could this diarrhoea be preventing my medications from being absorbed? Just a thought? Has anyone else experienced similar? Thank you Nicola",

My GP has prescribed me low dose amytriptiline as this can help, along with the ibuprofen.  I am still having this pain, but it has eased as the swelling has gone down. Try to persevere with the arm exercises, my BCN particularly said the walking up the wall one is good, where you try to reach as far as comfortable with your arm against a wall. It helped for me and just gentle stretching throughout the day. I hope it eases for you soon  best wishes Nicola xx",

      "Content": "Hello everyone, Ist oncologist appt yesterday, WLE & SNB in July revealed unexpected positive lymph node(1/3). Hormones receptors positive but HER2 neg.  I half expected to be told chemo, but as only 5% benefit and my allergies to antibiotics high, it is too risky. As an alternative, I am being offered axillary clearance, radiotherapy to the breast and armpit, along with Zoladex (Goserelin), Aromasin (exemestane) and Zometa (Bone infusion).  The Zoladex will put me into menopause and sounds horrendous.....monthly injections into tummy followed by night sweat, hot flushes etc. The Aromasin will be added in once the oestrogen levels have dropped sufficiently, followed by the bone infusion in 6 months to stop osteoporosis from the Aromasin!!!! I can handle the surgery and probably the daily two hour round trip for radiotherapy for a month, but the hormone treatment is freaking me out. I feel I am a very young 50 yr old, I know the natural menopause is approaching, but that it what I want it to be....natural. The other thing is why give one pill...Aromasin...and then give another to counteract its effect....Zometa? The side effects of these drugs sound horrendous, and I know everyone is different and some people will not have anything, but I hate taking pills for anything because I can be sensitive.... I even reacted to the SNB dye!!  I am in such a quandary again, my washing machine head is back and I am back to the worries I had before surgery, spending most of yesterday afternoon in tears (weak I know). Can I be sure that surgery RT and Hormones are going to be enough to conquer this damn cancer???? Sorry for the long post Nicola x",

I don't know what I would have done without this wonderful forum and website, we are so lucky to have Macmillan!!! Next trip to the oncologist is within a fortnight, and I now have some valid questions to ask her about the hormone therapy. Next decision is surgery to clear the axillary or radiotherapy to the area and the oncologist is bringing the radiologist with her for my next appointment. My thought is cut it out get rid, but I am going to listen to what the radiologist has to say first as I am still having probs with my underarm post op (swelling & slight cording - stretching all the time to alleviate!!!).  Thank you all again Nicola",

Personally, I am not keen on further surgery to the axilla, the recovery from the SLNB has been 'uncomfortable' to say the least. I am going to listen carefully to the oncologist, all my family are like, have everything (chemo), but I don't want to be over treated if not necessary. I think radiotherapy will probably be a way forward for me.  Very best wishes to you for your chemo, and keep in touch xx Nicola",
