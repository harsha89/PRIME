    "Content": "Hi all, I had a DIEP reconstruction in September 2012, although i was in surgery for 9.5 hours the blood supply failed and  I had a expander implant fitted. 3 weeks later my tummy was so tight my GP sent me back to hospital and I was admitted for a further 3 days, apparently all the tests showed nothing. A few days later the scar on my breast started leaking and they said I had an infection, back into hospital for iv antibiotics, they could not grow a culture so did now know what the problem was,  by the 6th day in hospital I had to bite the bullet and agree to have surgery to remove the implant, I cried all the way to surgery. My scar did not heal properly as the care I received after discharge was not good and have to have packing for secondary healing. 25th April this year and another reconstruction this time an LD reconstruction, I am now almost 3 weeks post op and very uncomfortable, I feel my new breast is abnormally large and will be going back to the hospital tomorrow as last week they said everything was fine despite my concerns. Looking at myself now it seems as if I will need some sort of surgery on my other breast which I am very fearful of.  ",
