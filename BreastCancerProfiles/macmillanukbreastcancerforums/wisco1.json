      "Content": "I had DCIS which was treated with lumpectomy & 3 lymph nodes removed, followed by Chemotherapy and Radiotherapy. I had my first mammogram in March this year which has came back clear. I found a swelling at top of my breast bone some weeks ago for which I had an x-Ray which also came back ok but the swelling is still there. Am I just being paranoid. I'm have constant wind like pain at shoulder level and the bottom of my left side anatriptoline for nerve pain. I also take paracetamol through the day. I don't know what to do next.",
