      "Content": "Hi everyone,  the things people say,  my sister in law said when i was going through chemo, just think you will be able to reinvent yourself, All i wanted to shout at her was, why what was wrong with me before. the most common one i get is,  my  ______  had cancer and they were really ill, but there fine now so you will be ok . i would rather people never talked about it instead of making stupid comments. Just talk about the weather. not very good at posting things on here.   lol lol would just like to say a big thank you to everyone on the whole site for keeping me sane during my treatment, love reading your posts and have been very helpful. big thanks and love and best wishes to everyone xxxx",

      "Content": "Hi Mags22, I am new to the group and not great at spelling, so hope you can figure out what i am saying lol I am like your mum, having chemo fec then t then surgery. I was told i have two small lumps, with two different cancers, one slow growing the other is an aggressive form of cancer  so the chemo would be given first to shrink them as much as possible, to save as much of the breast as possible. I am having my second cycle of chemo on monday if my cell count is ok as it was to low on friday  so blood test first,  what cycle is your mum on and how has she been. my lumps are so very small, they were only found because in our area they are inviting  ladies between 47-50 to have mammograms early, which may have saved my life, although when i went the radiographer said at least 3 people a day dont turn up for there appointments.",
