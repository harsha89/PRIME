      "Content": "Hi Wombat.123 I was sent for a mammogram last November 2015 as I had found a lump in right breast, have had quite a few problems with this breast in the last few years cysts and lumps and always been sent for mammograms as I have a form of leukaemia. Was told nothing to worry about you just have a lumpy breast. Fast forward September 2016 (being nosy) I missed a step and fell down, a couple of weeks later felt a painful lump in different area of breast, back for another mammogram expecting to be told just another lump, but no told it's breast cancer and apparently when they re-checked the November mammogram as I asked was it there then it turns out there was a shadow in that area then and I should have been recalled for further tests but wasn't.  I know I can't change the outcome now and need to focus on the here and now but keep thinking I should have noticed the lump earlier.",

It's weird isn't it that we can't wait to have an operation.  I only started using the forum recently but have rung the helpline a few times and they have been brilliant. If you are concerned about anything I would definitely recommend ringing the helpline plus use your breast care nurse. I understand what your husband means it feels like for the time being we are in a new normal. Wishing you all the best for next week and your operation on Monday. I'll be thinking of you. xxx",

I must admit I feel more concerned about this operation than I did about my lumpectomy and SNB. I have been wondering if they are going to find more. It's the waiting for the results which I find trying. It did feel like they gave me what good news they could first before they then dropped the news about a second operation.  Up to now it feels like every time I've been to the hospital it's been mixed news. I really do want to get off this roller coaster soon. I'm so glad everything is well with you. Thank you for your post it has made me feel less anxious. I have been worrying about the delay in having the op and what it would mean. xxx",

I had a lumpectomy in October but unfortunately they didn't get clear margins so I'm having to go back in for another operation, hopefully this Friday, as I had to cancel the one last Friday due to having cold but unfortunately my partner has come down with cold today, so fingers crossed I won't catch, but it's causing me sleepless nights, thinking the cancer has has spread.  We also had a holiday that we had to cancel. Good luck with your pre-op tomorrow but it's nothing to worry about. Daisy10 xxx",
