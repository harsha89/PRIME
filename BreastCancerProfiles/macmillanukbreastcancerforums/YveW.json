    "Content": "Hello Lee, what rubbish they come out with and I think we should make a stand against whoever made this comment.  My brother is not a drinker, is a vegeterian, has never smoked, has been active with yoga and dancing and is now in a dire situation with cancer.  I am sure on this site we all have proof that this is a load of codswallop and we should make it our mission to get whoever made this statement to take it back.   So if you could tell me who/where this comment came from I will happily take the lead. You are entitled to find those comments upsetting Lee. YveW x ",
