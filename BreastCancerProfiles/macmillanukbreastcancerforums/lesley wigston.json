      "Content": "Hi there, I`m not suere whether this will be helpful to you but if not it might make you laugh.When I was on my last lot of chemo one of the side effects of the drug was a bad skin reaction. I suffered this on my wrists,arms,feet,knees and thighs.It varied from looking like measles rash to psariasis.Nothing the doctors prescribed worked but a nurse mentioned something that another patient had tried.Udder cream!!! Yes cream used for cows and horses to prevent sore udders. I was sceptical but sent for some online.It is made of all natural products such as aloe vera,tea tree,castor oil.It worked, and left my skin lovely and soft.whether it would have cleared up in time anyway i dont know but it helped me when I needed it.

      "Content": "Back to work at the start of a new term we were all devastated to hear that a dear friend and colleague had been diagnosed with breast cancer.Within weeks I too was diagnosed with cancer after finding a large lump in my stomach.Mine was ovarian.We became fighters together, partners in crime!We helped each other through tough chemo weeks and caught up over coffee discussing the pros and cons of losing our hair, yes there were many laughs too.At the end of our respective chemo we had a wonderful afternoon together when we attended a \"look good ,feel good\" session.I was treated to a few days away and my friend planned a celebration party for her 50th before starting on radiotherapy.12months on and things were looking good, we were both back at work as teaching assistants at a primary school.I went for routine check only for them to find another tumour had appeared and i was told my condition was terminal.I was selected for a trial drug and started another round of chemo.Betweeen chemo I was at work and together with my friend organised three grande coffee mornings for cancer charities raising lots of money.We also did 2 race for life walks together.We enjoyed \"putting something back\".Then my friend had some bad news, her cancer had gone further and she too was diagnosed as terminal and was to have more chemo.time was passing and she wasnt responding well to treatment.She attended a school \"fuddle\" 4 weeks ago and it was lovely to see her and chat.She was tired but in good spirits. Today i learnt that she lost her fight.God Bless Karen.Thankfully no more pain.I will keep on fighting for us both.",

      "Content": "I havent the same cancer as you so I cannot comment on whether that is effecting your weight but just to share my experiance.Prior to my cancer diagnosis I was over 10 stone. After a hysterectomy ,10 days in hospital and immediate start on chemo I weighed 8 stone,the lowest I can ever remember being.As I went through 6months of chemo(including steroids) the weight started to come back.I was soon 11 stone and have remained that weight for over 2 and a half years( with another 6 months of chemo included).I dont like being this weight but have got used to having `havent got anything to fit` days.I have got to the stage now where ,when i go on the scales I am actually glad I havent lost anything as I would take it to be a bad sign.You will adapt and the important thing is that your treatment goes well. Good luck for that. Lesleyxx",

Youve had a tough time of it havent you? all the best for tomorrow.I had a pic line for 5 lots of chemo and then the line moved! They took it out and put it in the other arm.I had 1 lot inthere but then that got an infection so had to be taken out too.they were going to give me a couple more chemos but obviously couldnt then.Fortunately the chemo i had was enough to halt the growth of the tumour(its been 12 months now).Heres hoping its done the trick for you too. xx",

      "Content": "hi julie, Yes everyone and every case is different, according to the cancer, individual and treatment but i will tell of my experiences.(but always check with your doctor or oncologist if in doubt). Listen to your own body and generally if you feel up to doing things then do.I work in a school nursery so am always around lots of sneezing bug baring little mites! I started having about 4 days off after chemo but as side effects built up with treatment so did the amount of time that i had off.I was on 3 week cycles that generally went;1st week- not too goog, 2nd week-so-so-, 3rd week- good.If you unsure about being around lots of people at your daughters nativity then ask her teacher if you could attend the dress rehearsal instead, im sure they will oblige. good luck with all your treatment.
