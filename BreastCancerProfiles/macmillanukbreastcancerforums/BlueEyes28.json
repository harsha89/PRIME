      "Content": "Hi All I am booked in to have a double mastectomy with TUG flap reconstruction in September (preventative surgery - BRCA1) and Im just looking for some post-operation advice, particularly what people found most comfortable to wear after, how difficult it was to move around etc. There doesn\u2019t seem to be much information on the TUG flap reconstruction. Please no horror stories! Thank you xxx",
