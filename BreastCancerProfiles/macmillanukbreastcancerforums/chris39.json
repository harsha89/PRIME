    "Content": "Hi Jules, I too had a lumpectomy/ lymphnode clearance and 4 cycles of chemo followed by rads and was equally worried about starting tamoxifen.  I neednt have worried as i started on it last August for the next 5 years and have little or no side effects the only effects i have experienced are_ I have to get up and urinate most nights (i didnt do this previously) hot flushes (5 in 6 months can happen day or night and only last a minute or so) A bit more tired than usual And that is it so i count myself very lucky indeed when i read how some of you are suffering. I take my tamoxifen at night before bed and prefer the brand (Apps), i also have 2 infusions a year of the bisuphosphonate drug (Zometa) and so also take 2 calcium tablets each day to help bones. i hope this cheers you up and encourages you a bit. chris",
