      "Content": "Hi everyone, This is my first post on this forum as I've recently been more concerned with my endometrial cancer. (Surgery was last October) I was first diagnosed with BC in 2007, had WLE and radiotherapy, then in the last year of my five year follow up I had a recurrence, mastectomy and LD flap and implant. I am now in year 4 of my next lot of follow up, mammograms on non affected side clear, but I have a lump/ridge on my recon side. I'm having an ultrasound on Friday. I'm wondering if what I can feel is the edge of the implant, has anyone else had this? If it all has to be removed what are my options? ",

      "Content": "Hi everyone, I had my ultrasound today, and nothing sinister was found . It seems that the muscle they used for the recon has contracted and that is what can be felt. I'm so relieved.  Shaz - I hope you have similar good news on Tuesday, I will have fingers crossed! Nemchugh - I'm so sorry yours was cancer. Will you have to have surgery? I hope it proves to be Her2 neg this time.  Good luck and hugs to both of you.",

      "Content": "Hi Shaz, It's not painful, but your surgery is much more recent than mine. I didn't have radio after the mastectomy because I'd had it after the WLE previously. I'm maxed out on radiotherapy now!  Good luck to you for Tuesday!",
