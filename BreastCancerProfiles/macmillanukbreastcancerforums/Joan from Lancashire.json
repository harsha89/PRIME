I have cream to use, and apart from the scars feeling a bit tight and tender there has been no other soreness, that may change as my treatment progresses.",

      "Content": "Hi Barbara, Thankyou for asking, I have had session number 12 today and I have eight more to go, I have found the tiredness has started to kick in, which is a pain during the day but I am sleeping better at night. So far my skin has suffered from a bit of tightness but no \"sunburn\" the radiologist checked it out today and said it looked fine. I am getting very sharp stabbing pains in my breast from time to time and although I have mentioned it at the hospital no one has made any comment about it. I have a day off next Tuesday as the machines are being serviced, so I am hoping to go into work for an hour or so just to show my face and to take them some chocolates....its something we all do when someone has had a birthday and mine was on Sunday! The worst part of the treatment is the travelling to Preston everyday and having to be ready for my transport two hours before my appointment time, then when we get there there is always a delay of at least 30 minutes, last week it was an hour and a half! My appointments are at 1.15pm and I have asked for them to be changed but no can do, so I am stuck with it. But I am over halfway there and into my 3rd week, I finish my treatment on a Tuesday and then have the rest of the week to rest up and see if I feel fit enough to go back to work the following week, if not I will have another week or so off, apparently you keep on \"cooking\" for 2/3 weeks after the treatment has finished. I just keep telling myself that it will soon be over and then I can have my life back. Best wishes to you Joan    ",

      "Content": "Hi Barbara, I hope you are ok, I bet you are glad to have finished your treatments. I had planned to go back to work today but I was in a lot of pain over the weekend and called the District Nurse yesterday as some of my skin under my boob and under my arm had blistered and had burst and was weeping, she put a dry dressing on but when  another Nurse called this morning  she just put me a \"vaseline\" type dressing on as when she pulled the tape off yesterdays dressing the skin was coming away with it, luckily I have caught it in time and it's not infected, but it is painful. So I am having this week off work and I hope that will give it time to heal. So I am going to write my Christmas cards and letters and leave the shopping until I feel more up to it, I dread going out and someone bumping into me. Have you been told when you can start applying deodrant?, everyone I speak to has been told different things, one Lady has been told that she can't use it ever again because of the effecet on the Lymph nodes,but I find that hard to believe. All the best Joan",

There doesn't seem to be a set of guidelines that all the health care proffessionals follow and so you end up not knowing who to believe. Where did you buy Pit Rock.....what a terrible name for a deodrant, I hope I don't have to ask for it in a shop and then have to describe what it is, they will probably think I am making it up! I had one tumor and luckily no lymph nodes were affected so I had 20 Radio therapy treatments that consisted of 15 + 5 booster and I finished on the 9th November and I am also taking Letrazole, are you having hot flushes? I get them 2 or 3 times a day and also at night. I also have to take a Calcium and Vit D supplement. When I go for my follow up appointment I will ask my Oncologist about the deodrant situation and see what he says, but if I find any Pit Rock I will get some and try it. Best Wishes Joan",

      "Content": "I have been using Oilatum cream but I have now been told by the Radiography staff that they only recomend using Aqueous cream or E45 as neither of these contain  Aluminium. I am pretty sure that Oilatum doesn't and it's also Lanolin free. I think I would have been better buying a lotion rather than a cream as it is easier to absorb into the skin and needs less rubbing in and it's also more soothing. My skin is starting to feel the effects of the treatment I have a sunburnt prickly heat type rash and underneath my right breast the skin has broken and blistered, I was given some hydrocortisone cream today and I have to keep an eye on it in case it becomes infected.....my advice is do not wear a bra if you can manage without one, I have been wearing soft cotton strappy tops, but any pain and discomfort fades into the background  and  I am Euphoric as its my last treatment tomorrow and I am so glad, no more travelling over 60 miles a day, no more sitting around for hours on end waiting to be picked up, waiting for treatment and then waiting to be taken home. I finally had my review today, it was scheduled into my list of treatments but  30 minutes after my appointment time I realised it wasn't going to happen......last weeks was also cancelled and the week before the Consultant was too busy to see us. When I was called in for my treatment I enquired about it and they managed to find a Doctor who had time to see me, she couldn't tell me anything that I didn't already know but did clear me to go back to work next Monday. The extreme tiredness that I felt last week has lifted....but that maybe because I am so happy at being able to get back into my normal routine that the adrenaline is keeping me going. I have Weds, Thurs and Friday all to myself and I am planning to do some Xmas shopping. All the best to anyone who is starting radiotherapy, it does put your life on hold whilst you are having your treatment but it does come to an end and then hopefully we can all live a cancer free life.

I am starting on the last 5 treatments tomorrow, it involves putting some kind of cage contraption over me, but it eliminates the need for being lined up and hopefully should be quicker. I had a day off yesterday as the machines were being serviced.....it didn't stop two of them breaking down today though! It was lovely to have a long weekend away from treatments and travelling! My skin is still ok, but my boob feels a bit heavy and sore....a bit like pre period soreness....I haven't been wearing a bra and I think that has helped me, you are very lucky to be provided with cooling gel, we don't get offered anything at all.

I am nearly 52 and before my cancer was diagnosed I beleived that I had gone through the menopause as I had have had no periods since last November and all the menopause symptoms had stopped. About two week after my operation the hot sweats/flushes came back with avengence, as yet I haven't had a period but I do get PMT every few weeks and the niggly crampy type pains that I used to get at that time of the month. I did mention all that at my first appointment with him but he looked at me as if I was making it up. I was told before my op I would probably be prescribed Tamoxifen and I am wondering why I didn't get it....My Mum had breast cancer over 30 years ago and took part in the trials when tamoxifen  first  came out, she didn't have a reacurrence of breast cancer, every other person seems to be taking it and I haven't met anyone who is taking the same drug as me. I would be interested to know if anyone else is taking the same drug as me.",

I am in the 2nd week of a 4 week course of radiotherapy, I have to travel 30 miles everyday to get the treatment, I am provided with transport.....which is a Godsend and I have to be ready 2 hours before my appointment time, every day we arrive at the hospital and every day the department is running late, yeasterday they were an hour and half behind schedule and after leaving home at 11.15am I arrived back at 3.30pm, my day is completely taken over with waiting to go, sitting around and travelling back home all for the sake of a treatment that takes no more than 10  minutes. I have asked for my appointment time to be changed but I am not holding my breath. I don't know whether to go and see my GP and see if she can prescribe me something that will try to calm me down, but even finding the time to do that will be a challenge! Thankyou for reading  ",

I plucked up courage today and asked if I could sneak in before my turn.....the Lady who goes in before me takes nearly an hour to have her treatment but this isn't factored into the appointment system and this makes everyone else behind her very late. It meant that I got home for 2pm and was able to sort out other things that I needed to do. I should find out tomorrow whether my appointments can be changed to a different time, but I very much doubt it. I know that I will have to stick with it and I will keep counting down until it ends, and everyday is a day nearer it finishing. Many thanks for your kind words, its nice to know that its not just me that finds the whole process frustrating.  ",

If the films are clear why not say they are clear! My Daughter summed it up when she said she had filled in an evaluation form after a course she had been on, she had to assess from Excellent through to poor and satisfactory fell in the middle. I decided to ring the Breast care nurse and ask them to explain the mammogram results to me, she read out the report which said there was nothing to be seen that caused them to have any concerns and said she would express my concerns about how they phrase the letters they send out. I think I am being neurotic but  I would be interested to know how anyone elses letters were phrased and whether its just our local NHS Trust that uses the word \"satisfactory\"",

Before my radiotherapy started I asked if the radiation would effect my teeth ( I have a phobia of losing my teeth) - his answer \"It will if we point it at your mouth\" was there any need to answer a question like that?My dentist explained that it wouldn't nowadays as they can pinpoint exactly where they want the radiotherapy to go - so why couldn't the Oncologist answer my question like that? I also have a problem with a blood test result being to high, he dismissed it as being caused by me having Arthiritis  - I don't  have arthritis,  the pain in my hip seems to be a side effect of the medication! I don't feel as if he takes my worries seriously and I feel like I am on a production line every time I have to see him.
