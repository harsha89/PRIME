      "Content": "Hi Maria I've been taking tamoxifen for three months now. I'm experiencing the same side effects as you, I have had a full nights sleep since starting them. I mentioned it whilst I was having radiotherapy and the nurse suggested acupuncture ( in your ear) I was referred to the local holistic centre and have been allowed 10 free sessions. I was a bit skeptical at first, however 6 sessions in and I think I'm feeling some benefit from it. Maybe it's something you could try. Leanne xx",

      "Content": "Hi LM I had mastectomy and 7 nodes removed two which included sentinial nodes. Results were tumour 22mm stage 2 and one lymph node positive. Consultant from the start told me he wanted to treat it as aggressive as possible. I told him to do whatever was necessary. So two weeks later I was back in having more lymph nodes removed, another 27 so 34 in total thankfully it was still only in the one. My experience was that The lymph node clearance was nothing compared to the mastectomy. Like many people I had restricted movement in my arm following mastectomy, but it was getting better before I had clearance. So I was worried that I would be back to square one. I was surprised that regained full use not long after! It really wasn't as bad. Although I was shocked when my bc nurse called it 'minor' surgery. I did have a problem with my wound mind, it came open and I released loads of lymph fluid but again this was my experience and will probably not happen to you so pleased don't be alarmed by this. I'm starting chemo a week tomorrow and will be following on to herceptin as well as tamoifen for 5 years like yourself! I have been to the hospital today for a baseline heart scan so it can Be monitered whilst i have herceptin. I'm off tomorrow for my wig! It's all coming together now and at a fast rate so the nerves are setting in. Good luck with your next operation and I hope you recover quick! Hugs Leanne xx",

      "Content": "Hi Mandy I had a mastectomy 8 weeks ago and had 7 lymph nodes removed 1 of which contained cancer so 4 weeks ago had another 27 removed (all clear). The advice I have been given about bras is to find a specialist fitter (your hospital might have a link mine does and i will get a free bra as well as a prosthesis) I'm also going to Sadie the bra lady she is local to me but does have a website. But also marks and spencer bra staff are trained in fitting mastectomy bras. I haven't done this yet as I haven't healed well (scar came open) after second op but don't worry as everyone is different. I have to say that I haven't really been in pain as such but I was advised that after operation take painkillers regular for first couple of days which i did then went down to morning and night. To eventually nothing. It really wasn't as bad as I expected. I chose to stay in hospital until drains were removed ( I live alone with my 13 year old son and didn't want to frighten him further) so I spent four days in hospital after mastectomy. The nurse had me out of bed and in the bath the morning after my op I was so embarrassed, but in all honesty it was the best thing ever. The wound after mastectomy healed straight away brilliant! I looked and it really didn't other me as I knew cancer wasn't there anymore. I do have a strange sensation now where the scar is (get some cream and start massaging scar after second week) think it is nerve damage. I also asked nurse why it was so hard to which she replied 'it's your ribs' I did laugh as I teach biology oops! But you will have to get used to you new anatomy! What you must remember and believe me it took me a while, like pregnancy/birth everyone has a story to tell and can offer different advice but your experience is your experience. Wishing you lots of luck for Wednesday Leanne xx",
