      "Content": "Hi SuperSue and others who've had Tax... I had 3 Epi, 3 Tax and am now in my final section of 3 CMF.  It was the Tax that did for me too - as you say, pains, breathlessness, walking up the road (when I can even do that) like I'm in my 80s rather than 50s.  I was told that the last treatment, the CMF, would be a 'walk in the park' after Tax - it's true, but it's also re-igniting some of the Tax side effects, or seeming to keep them going.  Saw my lovely onc last week and she said this was to be expected.  She's still prescribing me the strong painkillers (Tramadol) and plenty of anti-sickness tablets - what ever I need to get through it.  At the start of all this I was advised (by the onc's registrar) that most women don't manage to stay in work through all this treatment.  At first I was able to stay at work for 2 weeks out of 3, but a few weeks ago I told them not to expect me back at work until this treatment is all done, and then who knows how long it will take to be at full capacity again?  It's hard to let go of meeting all the demands, I just know now that for me there's no option, and I need the space and rest to recover.  To fight it too much just might prolong the recovery - time to be very kind and gentle with myself.  Maybe you need to be a bit super to yourself... Incidentally, I only had infections a couple of times and was hospitalised once, given antibiotics and a blood transfusion.  I never had the low blood counts before treatments, even though I felt that surely I must have, as I often still felt so low after the Tax.  My onc says it's one of their best and strongest treatments, but its effects are really hard to bear.  It's a long road, isn't it?  I don't suppose any 'authority' will tell you, or me, when we will feel our normal selves again.  It's a daily challenge to be patient and accepting of our new circumstances. Best wishes, Sally",

      "Content": "Hi Patricia, sincerely sorry for you in all this pain and infection, it's horrific.  I went through 3 doses of Tax and it was bad, though for me not quite as bad as you. Yes, the pains, the oral thrush, the sore feet, losing nails, etc., it's all part of it I'm afraid.  I had Tramadol for the pain and that made a big difference, so I recommend getting it asap if you haven't already.  (Warning, get something for constipation, caused by the Tramadol - the shock of extreme constipation is something I never want to experience again)!  I'm afraid the pain thing has gone on way beyond the last dose of Tax as well.  It seems that the different chemo I'm now on for 3 doses (CMF) triggers the pains again each time - my oncologist says this is a known side effect.  I hope some of the meds you've been given will make it more tolerable.  It will all pass eventually, but you may need to accept you're going to be ill with this treatment and you won't be able to do all those normal things you are so desperate to keep up.  Sometimes it's better to mentally try to accept this, and to ask for the all the help you can get.  I'll be reaching my 9th and final chemo treatment in another few weeks, (am in radiotherapy at the moment), and so the light is there at the end of my tunnel, and it will be so for you in turn.  Very best wishes, Patricia, I hope you are getting lots of loving support from those around you.

      "Content": "Hi Sascha Rose. Yes, I am undergoing chemo with only one kidney and I've had nothing bad happen in relation to that kidney I thought my having 1 kidney would be a cause for concern with chemotherapy, but my oncologist did seem to think that it represented any significant risk. My course of treatments has been Epirubicin x 3, Taxotere x 3, CMF x 3, given every 3 weeks and every 4 weeks in the case of CMF. They've been given introvenously, in fact I've had a PICC line for the duration and am very glad of it, as I don't relish all the digging round for my hard to find veins! I've completed the first 6 of the treatments so only 3 to go now. The first two of those treatments I was told would be the toughest and certainly the last has some pretty bad side effects, especially cumulatively. However I stress, absolutely no impact on my kidney. My main concern going into this was the risk of infection and therefore the use of antibiotics, as I've become sensitive/allergic to many antibiotics over the 30 years of treating urine infections. Fortunately I've only picked up 1 infection during the chemo and that was treated fine with an antibiotic to which I wasn't sensitive. I should add that, despite the one kidney, my situation seems less concerning than yours. I do not have an ongoing kidney condition - my damaged kidney was probably damaged from birth although not diagnosed until an adult and then not removed until I was 30 years old. Also my breast cancer was stage 1. I hope this helps a little, to know that someone else with one kidney is going through this quite safely, although we are all different in how we experience this. My experience is that it's a tough journey and I hope I never have to repeat it, but hopefully that's exactly what it will do for me, prevent me from ever having this cancer again. Good luck, Sally.",

      "Content": "Hi Wendy, read your post and the following one from Claire, who is far further down the line than me, but felt like chipping in anyway. I have just started on epi-T-CMF, i.e. epirubicin for 3 cycles, taxotere for 3 then CMF for 3. I'm just a week on from my first epi treatment and took the week off work as it was suggested the first week would be the toughest. Good decision! It wasn't terrible, but I certainly felt sick a lot and tired a lot and couldn't have done more than an hour or 2 of anything. Turned a corner exactly a week on, feeling brighter, no real sickness (or heartburn, that was another SE when I stopped taking the anti-acid tabs at first, but calmed now), managed to do some house cleaning. Then got carried away with myself and went to the cinema one day and the shops the next. A bit too much I think, as today was tired and my temperature went up above normal, but briefly. As for other SEs, I can feel the lining of my mouth begin to be damaged - feels kind of rough. Oh and I went off coffee immediately - as a serious espresso drinker that is strange, but don't want it all (just like being pregnant)! I was told that my hair would fall out around week 3, (an SE of epi and taxotere but not CMF). I had my hair cut short before chemo started, to make the hair loss effect less drastic. It also made it easier to choose a wig, as I've now got a very short one almost a dead match for the current haircut, so the transition to that should be easy. Am planning to work from home tomorrow morning, so really hoping that during the week ahead I can get involved in my work again - and get paid! My oncologist warned me before starting, 'most women do not manage to stay at work during this treatment'. I was shocked and taken aback, but I guess it's allowed me - and my workplace - to look at all possibilities, including the one where I stop working for about 6 months. I hope that's not the case, but better to be mentally prepared. Good luck, keep us posted on how you're finding it. Sally x",

      "Content": "Yes, the loss of taste is horrible, although I didn't suffer with sickness but could only eat small amounts.  I liked either sweet or salty things - found myself going off things I loved (chocolate, coffee)and eating things I wouldn't normally want (e.g. crisps). I indulged my new desire for extra sweetness, especially if if helped me eat healthy things.  For example blueberries are supposed to be a super anti-cancer food, so I'd mash 'em up with half a teaspoon of sugar and add a dollop of creme fraiche and eat that.  Better to eat a little of what  you fancy than try to eat 'normal' meals.  In fact all kinds of fresh fruit mixes were generally good to eat.  Still not interested in chocolate a couple of months after last Tax!  The American Institute for Cancer Research (online at www then the initials of the organisation then a dot org) has good advice on healthy eating and cancer preventative foods - you can sign up for weekly emails of recipes if you like.  Best wishes, Sally",
