      "Content": "Thanks for taking the time to reply, my children are 4, 16 and my eldest is 19.  My youngest cries when I'm leaving now and I did explain that nana would come to our house and we will look after her but it's hard for one do young to fully understand.  I have ran all of the scenarios through my head, what if she's crying in pain or highly agitated during the night, thankfully we have an upper floor with an additional two bedrooms, the solution is to put the children upstairs so they aren't woken during the night, hubby will be there too.  Unfortunately mum made it clear in her care plan at the start that under no circumstances was she to go to the hospice, they would take her with open arms. Her room in my house is much bigger than her room in her own house which is cramped now with hospital bed and equipment.  Today I'm trying to take the attitude that whatever will be will be and I'm trying not to get too stressed ",

      "Content": "My mums was diagnosed with grade 3 stage 4 metastatic breast cancer in May and unfortunately no treatment was offered due to existing heart condition.  She was given a prognosis of 2-7 months, its in her lungs, liver and bones.  A couple of weeks ago she took some kind of turn and had to get the scringe driver in but started to improve as did her swallow and it was taken out again.  She's been in bed since, the pain is under control but she is very confused and quite agitated most of the time.  She's in her own flat and I've spent about 5 nights in the last month and a half at home with my husband at children who I miss terribly.  I want to take her home to my house as she thinks she's in hospital now anyway, is that selfish? Her brother and sisters have all turned on me for suggesting it, I'm her only daughter, my brothers are fully supportive of me but this will cause a major rift with mum's extended family, what do I do for the best, im at breaking point and mum could linger on for weeks",
