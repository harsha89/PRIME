      "Content": "New to the site! New to it all. Found out i have breast cancer and started my chemo all in the space of a few weeks!! I am having ec chemo and using the cool cap. My first chemo date was 18th Aug. Luckily i have had no sickness and no hair loss!! Although i am aware i have loads of time for this and have found a lovely wig that i will be getting this week!! Although i renamed the wig 'glamhat' as i hate the word wig!! Haha. Im being positive still at work & still smiling. It will be lovely to speak to people going through this too as although i am mostly positive i still have a few tears and feel a bit scared. Got to be strong i have a beautiful 2year old baby girl who needs a \"normal\"life :) feel free to add me and talk. Lots of love Steph xxx",
