    "Content": "I have been told i need to have a mastectomy but am not sure which reconstruction method to choose. I want to get back to normal and work as soon as possible so i am thinking about having implants. I know these can be a problem if radiotherapy is needed afterwards and may be rejected. If i have the stomach or back flap operation i would still need implants as i do not have enough fat/tissue to make decent sized breasts. I just don't know what to do. Has anyone had the same problem or chosen to have implants. If so do they look/feel ok and if radiotherapy was needed did any problems arise.?.",
