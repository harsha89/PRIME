    "Content": "Hi I was diagnosed with inflammatory breast cancer in May. Normal treatment is chemo, mastectomy then radiotherapy then hormone treatment, but I have multiple health problems, and can only have 60% of the normal dose which is not enough to shrink it, when they found the cancer it was 8cms long and all my lymph nodes on the right side were involved. When they removed it 17 days later it 15.5 cms. But the oncologists are great and are altering any treatment to suit me, have Â faith they you and adapt any treatment to suit you. Jenny",
