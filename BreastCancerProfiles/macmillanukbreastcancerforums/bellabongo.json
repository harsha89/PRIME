      "Content": "I know what you mean. When you see people with cancer on the TV, they are cheerfully brave people or the adverts with the sad music and, basically, sad, sad, sad. They should show me in the supermarket queue hanging on to my trolley coz I'm tired out with chemo, or eating popcorn at the movies, having tea and scones with friends at the garden centre. In fact, getting on with living with cancer and the treatment. There are people with cancer at work, off work, on holiday, resting on the couch, cooking dinner, etc. Cancer people are everywhere, doing normal things.  Would be nice to see that kind of cancer person for a change. Love to all Alison xxx ",

      "Content": "Hi Tinker, I am a wee interloper from the womb cancer forum. Carbo/taxol is often used for the ladies with womb cancer, I had four cycles last year. Each cycle was three weeks. I don't know what the BC cycles or doses are like, whether it's once a week or what. It can make you achey, and remember to take the anti-nauseas they give you. It also gave me a bit of a sore mouth. You will be tired, so go as easy as you can. Lost my hair of course. Hats, wigs, scarves can cover that.  Hopefully the BC ladies will come on with their wealth of knowledge  Lots of love  Alison xxx ",
