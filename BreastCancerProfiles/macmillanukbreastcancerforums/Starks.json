      "Content": "Katie123 your post came just at the right time today!! I'm sat in work trying to get everything finished off ready to leave and start chemo on Tuesday. The last couple of days I've been feeling totally overwhelmed by the thought of chemo, all the lovely side effects, worrying how much it's going to effect my life, mad it's changing life, sad i can't fire on all cylinders in work, blah, blah. I've been getting out the shower and trying to visualise being bald using my hands on my head, bought 5 bargain hats and bands on ASOS yesterday, ordered every remedy I've heard about with just water, ice lollies and soft toothbrushes to get this weekend! It's so uplifting to read a post like yours and hear things do work, it's doable and to just listen to your body. Something I'm not good at but will definitely start to do! My Manuka is on route as we speak so that will be on a spoon and down my neck from Monday! I know everyone has different side effects but knowing they can be helped and managed with honey, water, and all the other great advice on here makes me feel a million % better about whats to come. Still can't quite believe it's going to start next week but at least i'm prepared and again Katie thank you for making me feel much better today, it really is one day at a time and you never know when something will come along and make you feel better! xxx",

      "Content": "Hi all, I've been signed upto this group for a few weeks now but this is my first post! The support and advice I have found invaluable! It helps to know you're not the only person facing cancer, chemo and all the other fun it brings! I had a lumpectomy 3 months ago, surrounding areas clear and nodes clear which was a huge relief. Since the op I've been told I need chemotherapy because the cancer was grade 3 and triple positive. A piece of news which left me heartbroken because chemo was something I was so scared of, makes cancer seem all that more real! I start on 2nd sept and the plan is for 4 x ec followed by 4x docetaxel with herceptin. I have read lots of posts on here and done my research to try and take the fear out of what's to come and get myself as prepared as possible for what the side effects may be. I have a gorgeous wig, something I did straight away because losing my hair was my biggest fear, I think I've prepared as well as I can for the hair part and hopefully will not look too crap bald! I wanted to get your lovely ladies advice on tips for coping with all the other things that can happen - sore mouth, loss of taste, crap nails - I have gel on fingers and toes, can I keep that on?? Been told I'll feel crap 2/3 days after, how crap is crap and what can I do to help myself? Lots of water? Exercise? Also when my immune system is down do I have to go into hibernation? Basically how do you make the best of a rubbish situation! I have an amazing medical team and a huge amount of love and support from friends and family which has been my lifeline over the last few months! But it's good to talk to people who are facing the same fears, on the roller coaster and know exactly what it's like when it's happening to you! All tips and hints welcomed!x",

I've got my wig in it's box waiting to be used, had a few practices wearing it! I was lucky to be recommended a great shop close by, in Manchester - if you're close I'd definitely recommend a visit? Salon Maier, i was spoiled for choice with lots of great wigs and they have all kinds of alternative head wear too. I also found a site called suburban turban - there are some great hats on there which you order online and they aren't too expensive.Â  Losing my hair was my biggest fear when I found out I needed chemo, but I've tried my best to make it as positive as possible and looking for lots of different options so i have choice.

      "Content": "So I'm 8 days post 1st EC and feeling really well with the exception of crying about losing my hair! Despite buying various hats and a couple of wigs I just feel really sad about going bald and I'm checking daily for it going! I went from shoulder length to a short do which has helped but I'm still worried about it actual falling out fully! The thought of deciding what to put on my head to go anywhere and will I feel conscious and will people look at me like the poor cancer patient just makes me cry! I spent years being image conscious in public thanks to teenage acne and it just feels so cruel I'm now worrying again! God knows how I'll feel when the eyelashes and brows start going too! Cried all the way through writing that! Having a why me day!! My best friend is a hairdresser and beautician so she's coming round this weekend to cut my hair shorter again, maybe that'll ease the panic? Still have to face going out tho which is the bit I'm worried about, fear of the unknown! Just like the worry of the op, getting results, finding out what treatment you have to face, having that first chemo......bloody long and touch journey of unknowns and crap things! Misery session over! Just needed to write it down rather than sit here crying on such a beautiful day!! Awaiting a shorter wig this week which might help, the longer one I originally bought I tried yesterday and thought it looked bloody stupid! Need to persevere! Hopefully when it happens I'll feel better and embrace it! I hope so! Who knew hair could mean so much! Starks xxx",
