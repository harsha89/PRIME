      "Content": "Hi! I was diagnosed with breast cancer in January and I have had chemo, surgery and radiotherapy. I have been signed off work since February. Does anyone have experience and would like to share their thoughts on when to go back to work again. I\u2019m at the moment not sure when I will go back, because how do I know when I\u2019m ready ? My work is quite physical demanding. I will go back part time to start with once I go back. Many thanks!",
