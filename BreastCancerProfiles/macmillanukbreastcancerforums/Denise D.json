I have worked in the NHS for 25 years and seen many changes and agree also that throwing more money at it is not the answer. Bank staff cost twice as much as our permanent staff and I spend half my time sorting out the problems they cause because they are not as answerable for their actions. I wonder if Mr Cameron would take this action if one of his loved ones had breast cancer and it gave them longer to live. ",

Over Christmas negative thoughts do keep coming into my mind it is the last thing I think of at night , all through the night and then first thing in the morning - What is that pain ? Will it come back ? I do know I can do nothing about it that I hate because it is out of my control. I have decided that it has changed my life for ever but I will not allow it to cloud every day I am trying so hard to make the cancer experience not spoil my life - but it is very hard I do understand.

I have immune and osteoarthritis quite wide spread anyway but was getting so I could not manage stairs or move about very well because of the pain. I was seriously thinking of having to stop working added to this I was not sleeping. A locum GP took pity on me 2 days before Christmas and prescribed Arimidex for one month, the difference after 7 days was amazing I was much mobile pain reduced and sleeping for 4 hours at a time. I asked for a repeat prescription of Arimidex but my GP said I have to have Anastroloze. I am so upset I cannot take Anastroloze because I fear I will end up in a wheelchair because of reduced mobility. She said it is no different just alot mire expensive I offered to pay for it and she quoted something in the region of £1000 each prescription. I really do not know what to do my tumour was ER7 and PR8 which I am told is high. Has anyone got any advice please I feel so tearful over this decision. ",
