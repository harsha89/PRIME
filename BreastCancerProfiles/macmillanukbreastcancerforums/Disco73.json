    "Content": "Firstly welcome to the forums Lou. There are some wonderfully fantastic ladies to support you on here. I don't post very often but wanted to let you know that mistymoley is right this might be the worst 6 to 12 months of your life but these ladies will get you through it!   Secondly Dreamthief  what do you mean MAY contain nuts? I think it definitely DOES contain nuts probably more than a special edition snicker!  but it's all what keeps me smiling!   I found my lumpy bumpy in April and when I went they found two large lumps one grade 3 so I was really lucky I found it as I'm not due for standard mammogram for another 9 years!!! Mastectomy & snb op followed by auxiliary and flap clearance op I'm now starting chemo tomorrow.  I thought losing my basoinka (as my 10 year old calls it she doesn't like the word boob or breast ) would destroy me, I forced myself to look at it almost immediately and just shrugged my shoulders and thought onwards and upwards could be worse! Might have had something to do with the fact I was probably still doped up!  But it did help me.    I Was upset yesterday about cutting my hair ready for the chemo but I'm fine again today. You are definitely going to have some major up and down days but trust me there will always be someone on here that will know how you are feeling and try and give you a little cheer up!     Keep eps your chin up and remember you are not alone in this   XOXO    ",
