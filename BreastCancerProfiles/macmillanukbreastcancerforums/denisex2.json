      "Content": "just had my first chemo session today and tried the cold cap to see how successful it will be. Not sure i will carry on with it all the way through though. My 16 & 18yr girls are quite laid back about the hair loss happening they just keep saying you hate styling your hair anyway mum. The boys 7 & 9 have not taken it in fully but know it could happen so i have brought a few hats for them 2 c me in now . As every day will bring a change i just tackle it with them as it comes i don't want to keep over loading them with things that are going to happen. so far so good. take care",

      "Content": "hi on the days after my chemo i have found it a struggle to even talk to my best friend. Everyone feels different in the days after , we now have our own special code she txt ever day to say hi but if i don't repply she knows i'm having a rough day. She keeps me supplied with funny cards via the post when she knows i'm down. Just knowing that you are there and love her will help her loads. Just thought of the mad photo of us she pinned to my fridge to make me smile every day. Wishing you both loads of positive energy x",

      "Content": "hi I've had 3 cycles of 6 of FEC chemo and started using the coldcap for the 1st 2. I didn't find it to unbearable just like sticking my head in a bucket of ice to start with. My hair was really long and thick to start with and so i had it cut into a bob to ensure it was covered by the cap. My hair thined out dramatically after the first 2 cycles and so i had it cropped short [eat your heart out posh spice] as i got fed up with having to hoover the bed and carpets every day. I chose not to have the cap when i went for my last session as i couldn't bear having to sit there for another 1 1/2hr after treatment as i just needed to get out of the place. The thought of looing my hair at the start of the treatment was one of the worst emotional battles i had to make in the treatment plan, sounds very vain i know but i always thought it was one of my best assets. Amazingly though now i constantly forget about that part of my appearance and can't believe that i used to spend hours drying and straightening my hair. Bandana and beenies are my new best friends . One tip if you do decide to use the cap when you have wet your hair take some conditioner and comb it through your hair it helps with the conection and the conditon of your hair. Good luck and feel free to message me if you have any questions i found this site really helpful.",
