      "Content": "thanks for the reply. it has helped. this morning i felt much better and just feel a little sick now. I will continue with the meds they gave me. I will have a word when i next go or if this continues beyond the start of next week. I am on 3 weekly chemo so now know what to expect a bit and how to listen to my body and do as it tells me.
