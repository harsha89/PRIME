      "Content": "hi mjangelfairy sorry to hear about about your hair but i know how you feel.  hopefully your hair will all come back but i had 6 fec/taxotere and 12 months of herceptin which finished in dec 10 and i am still bald on 50 per cent of my scalp.  i was sent to a hair specialist who asked me if their was baldness in the family and yes my father was bald.  the doctor said that the treatment had caused a premature menopause and the balding was female pattern balding but obviously this would not have happened at 45 if i had not had the treatment.  they told me their was nothing i could do except buy tropical treatments which may or may not help.  it had made me feel like a man as i used to have long thick hair and now i my hair looks like andy's from little britain ie the one in the wheelchair he he. i have also looked into hair systems but i'm not sure at the minute - please keep your chin up and know you are not the only onexox",

      "Content": "Hi Tina, Unfortunately this type of attitude is not that uncommon.  Hopefully, your  boss  will  think about her reaction and  change her attitude. I don't know where you live but you should have access to equality advice.  I'm from northern ireland and we have a government agency who gives advice on empoyment rights etc. called the Equality Commission.   If you are from the mainland i think there is a similar type of organisation.  please don't compromise your health for anyone.  Go and have the operation, your boss should be able to get causal cover until you can return.  I worked for the same organisation for 28 years and was treated like dirt when i was diagnosed with cancer.  they had offered me a job closer to home and let gave it to someone else instead of arranging temporary cover.  i had a two year battle with them which i didn't need on top of cancer.  They made things as difficult as possible and it resulted in a court case which they settled after almost 2 years.  I was in the same position as you and on my own, this means your job is even more precious, so don't resign.  Legally, you are covered by the disability act and your boss has to give you time off for treatment and keep the job open for you. I have been there too so don't give up and find out your rights and most important of all look after yourself. x  ",
