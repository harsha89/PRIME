      "Content": "Hi there,  I just wanted to let you know that I understand how you feel.  I have been told that my BMI is too high and I need to some lose some weight also.  I do have a date for my mastectomy and reconstruction, which is September, and I need to get of about a stone and a half, which may or not give me a BMI of 30.  I have joined Weight Watchers so maybe that is something you could try? I am rubbish at exercising though and you sound like you are really doing well in this area!  Well done for swimming and walking etc. I also find it hard and It is difficult to be positive, particularly if you are a comfort eater? Being redundant is also tough so you have a lot going on at the moment and you are a bound to be fed up.   Getting some weekly support might really help you keep focused.  Have you tried WW or Slimming World or the Fast Diet? Let me know if there is anything else I can support you with, ideas or chatting, or weighing in on the same day for example?  Keep your chin up where you can.  Jane.",
