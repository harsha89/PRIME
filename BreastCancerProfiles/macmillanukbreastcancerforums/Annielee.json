      "Content": "Hi still anxiously  waiting for my appointment at the breast clinic ....am posting on  here as it's this time of night I turn to Dr Google and make myself 100 times worse....how do you guys cope with the wait... Keep going over in my head what the practice nurse said at the appointment. ...I was in that much shock I didn't ask any questions which is out of character for me especially being a nurse (MH) and a nosey bugger.... All I remember  her saying is that there are 3 lumps but they are smooth....I will refer you for an urgent appointment though because you found dimples aswell try not to get anxious it will take two weeks... I'm due to get married early next year and was excited for the twelve month count down / planning to start ....also going on my hen weekend September abroad so lots to plan and look forward  too.... but now I find myself planning for the worse case scenario cancelling everything in my head and having stupid amounts of baths so I can have a good sob without my daughter and partner noticing  Sorry to vent there are a lot of very brave ladies on here my problems are a drop in the ocean in comparison I just feel so stuck and dread going to work tomorrow.... trying to hold it together to speak to depressed and troubled patients when I'm so sad inside myself ",
