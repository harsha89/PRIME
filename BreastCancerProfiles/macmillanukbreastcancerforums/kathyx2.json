    "Content": "Hi Jane, You no what I've never been an angry person until I got BC. Now I have quite a list of things that make me angry!! I know what you mean about being positive, people keep telling me I'm an inspiration - but I dont want to be an inspiration, I just want to be normal. I got DX in June, great big lump, grade 3 with nodes involved as well. Had 5 months chemo, surgery and now radio. Also tamoxifen. What makes me angry is that bunch in radio who think you can keep an operated arm above your head for over an hour without moving. I know its their job but it really hurts!! Take care. Kathy xxx PS I had a breast care nurse but I got most of my support from my Mc Millian nurse she is a gosend. x",
