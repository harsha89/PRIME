I just had my first year check up and was a wreck waiting for the results I'm fine .I know that I'm a different person wiser , stronger for this experience . Medication doesn't help that can be a problem for me some days as that drags me down I just have to pull myself up . The anger will subside as you start to relax and enjoy life again",
