      "Content": "Hi wendloui I am now a year on from where you are. I too had idc grade 3 5/13 nodes cancerous and triple positive. I have had a mastectomy, radiotherapy, herceptin and tamoxifen. With a few hiccups along the way but here I am on the other side   To be honest I think the \"it's happening to someone else\" mode is a perfectly normal response to the trauma we are going through. It has certainly got me through. I have only looked as far as the next appointment as any further was always too much for me to think about. You will need all of your energy but it is doable. You will have days that it does overwhelm you but just go with and cry, scream, shout what ever gets you through. It is all perfectly normal. When you get all of the info it somehow makes it easier but do be prepared for hiccups along the way on the basis if they don't happen it's a bonus. Sending a hug xx Lisa Mc",

I've had mx, chemo, radio, herceptin and tamoxifen but decided to go back on phased return after 10 months. I did a couple of hours a day and nothing too physical but was very surprised how physically and mentally exhausting it was. I was trying to convince myself I needed to work to get back to normal ( as well as earn money!) however I now know my new normal is very different. So I left in August and am lucky enough to be able to get my head and body straight before I do something else. However I know I will go back to work as I want to feel fulfilled. I believe what comes to you is meant for you so I'm sure the right opportunity will come your way. Lisa Mc x",

I did stop before radiotherapy though so about 4 months in all It is really not pleasant to inject yourself everyday and my stomach was also a mass of bruises. I asked the district nurse if I was doing it wrong as I was so bruised but she said that even if they do them the same happens. I'm sorry I can't be more reassuring but you are nearly done now and better to inject yourself rather than have a clot moving around. X Lisa ",

My eyes were so cold during the sessions I had to hold my hands over them to try and stop the pain. They would water all of the time when outside especially if windy but this was probably due to lack of eye lashes. They also started to twitch regularly which was a real worry.   I had an eye test and was told they were fine and my basic reading glasses were all I needed. However I do feel my sight is worse 4 months on so although they have improved I am hoping they will continue to do so. Watering stopped now I have eyelashes back. Lisa",

It was a little uncomfortable to put in as they need to give it a good push but was under local so not painful. Once it in no problems at all, I had a district nurse once a week to flush it out and again no issue or pain. I do now have two small scars on my chest where it went in n out and the vein in my neck is raised at the point of entry but all manageable.

You will still have anaesthetic in your system anyway but you have been through a big operation and it will take a while for your body and mind to come to terms with it. Doing the excersises is easier once the drip has been removed and you will feel more comfortable. Just a little movement regularly is enough for now and build it up. I had the same op in June 2015 and really it hasn't been that long that I can say I have healed and am comfortable with it all.

I tried to keep it to a minimum, my husband and best friend until I had a plan and had got the chance to get my head around it. Also the being in control bit was important to me. I found myself reassuring people when I told them which wasn't what I had expected. Also be ready for different responses from people because until u tell them you don't know what they might say. Some of my friends n family were very \" you'll be fine, you're a strong woman\" and another said \" omg how much more can I take\" meaning herself. If u are going away with your friend I think you should tell her b4 you go so u can both have time to get your heads around it and still make the most of the trip. The most important thing is take someone with you to get the results as it will all be a blur. Thinking of you and the decisions to make x Lisa ",

There are many treatments they can offer if indeed they are cancerous but they won't say until they have the biopsy results for obvious reasons. I have not heard anybody on this site who have said no treatment is offered.  Once you have been given a plan of action you can focus on one step at a time.

In fact I got as far as sitting in the hospital just after my mastectomy and the emotion was so strong I have not been able to go past this point yet. Probably would have been better to write it down as it happened as I might have dealt with it better, as doing it this way round has had a real impact on me. Now I have more time to think about it the trauma is staying with me. I am hoping to get through this and continue as there is clearly work to be done. The funny thing is as I wrote in the book my husband whom I told was not to read it as it was for my thoughts only, constantly questioned me what I was writing about him. He just couldn't get that it was about my head not practicalties. I think crystaljuju makes a good point about counselling and how we need to get the right support to get us back in a good place.

However when I spoke to my bcn and she asked what was the worst thing so far, I told her that to not have a breast for two years was devastating. She booked me an appointment with another consultant as it turned out there were two consultants one that did reconstructions and one that did not. I met him and it was agreed I could have an expandable saline implant until after radiotherapy which would then be replaced. It's worth asking the question as if I had not been asked I would have gone ahead. I was 46 and got married in the April so it was really important to me to get this done. Hope this helps Lisa",
