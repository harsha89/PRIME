My side effects weren't too bad - just a lot of incredible tiredness, I wasn't sick or particularly nauseous so I know I've got off lightly! Fingers crossed it will be the same again. Xxx",

Really hoping I'm not as nervous this time.  Couldn't believe how frightened I felt last time - found it far more scarey than surgery which is weird.  Anyway, it's could to have the support from the forum.   Good luck everyone, Vickie xx",

      "Content": "Hi Pat,   How are you today? I'm feeling okay. Thursday was a very long day but the staff were lovely and even though it was a strange experience I felt well looked after.  Felt a bit strange yesterday but pottered about; took the dogs out for a walk and did a bit of ironing (exciting stuff!) I've been drinking lots so I'm hoping that will flush out of my body. Today is my final day of steroids so I'm aware that how I'm feeling is probably a bit artificial.  I've also been given another, different type of anti-nausea drugs to start tomoro - that's what I'm dreading really, as I hate feeling sick but hopefully they'll work. Anyway, how are you feeling today ?  Hope your PICC line has settled down. Vickie xx",

I'm also off work as I work in a college which is a hotbed of germs so not worth the risk.  It is strange being off but at least Spring is in the air and we also have dogs so when I'm feeling okay I hope to be out with them as much as possible.  I've had 2 ops before my chemo and after chemo I'm having 3 wks of radiotherapy so we're on similar paths.  Have a relaxing day, xxx",

I'm not having a PICC line, just a cannula which I'm a bit worried about as I had a bit of a nightmare at my last op as they struggled to get one in - going to wear my warmest gloves tomoro to make it easier! I'm sure it will be fine.  I'II let you know how I get on.  It would be great to keep in touch as we're going through the same process at the same time - I'm having 3 FEC and then 3 Docetaxel.  Take care,   Love, Vickie xx",

I found that talking it through and just sharing how you are feeling, which will change day to day really helps.  I completely trust the medical team who have looked after me and there are so many treatment options so I'm sure you will be well looked after.  Will be thinking of you tomorrow, hope someone's going with you ?  Take care, Vickie xx",

      "Content": "Hi,   Thought I'd share my experience which may help.  I'm currently going through chemo and I live on a farm as my amazing other half is a dairy farmer. My nurse has told us to be careful and we are very strict with hand washing, keeping work clothes seperate and we have hygiene hand gel all over the place so that anyone coming from the farm into the house uses it.  I also stay away from the farm yard and the cows to minimise any risk. As well as having cows and a couple of chickens we also have 3 lovely dogs.  The farm dog lives in her own utility room and even though she accompanies me on walks (think she's keeping an eye on me, bless her) I avoid touching her or handling her - we just chat instead.  The other two live in the house and I'm just really careful with hygiene. I couldn't imagine being without them and they have definitely helped me cope as they have just carried on as normal - they don't know I'm a cancer patient although I think I smell a bit funny after chemo as they sniff me suspiciously! I suppose the only thing to consider is whether you have the energy levels required for helping a new dog settle in but I think the right dog could be a lovely distraction.  Anyway, all the best with whatever you decide.  Whether you get your dog now or after treatment you'll still end up with a lovely new friend,   Vickie xx  ",
