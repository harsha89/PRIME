It is getting worse as I feel nausea, no appetite, chills, sad and crying for no reason. Have spoken to my doctors and they said that chemotherapy has made me menopausal and Tamoxifen has surpressed my hormones, therefore causing this. It is really so difficult to handle my anxieties and it's physical symptoms everyday. Doctor said that there's no cure and my body needs time to get used to its present condition. Is this really true? It is really horrible living like this. Really appreciate if anyone could advise. Many thanks ",
