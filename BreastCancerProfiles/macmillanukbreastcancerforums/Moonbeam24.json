      "Content": "Hi, I'm new to the group. I'm 49 yrs old had a lumpectomy to remove a small area of Lobular cancer three weeks ago. All went well and I am feeling fit again. However, I had my post surgery, follow up consultation yesterday and was informed that the margins were not clear on one side of the excision. After a discussion with my surgeon I have to decide whether to go for a re-excision or mastectomy. I've never been in a forum before, so apologies if i'm not observing the proper etiquette, but i was wondering if anybody had any experience of a re-excision after margins not being clear on a lumpectomy?  ",

      "Content": "Hi Grogg, thank you for your reply. The surgeon said that she could just take a bit more off the side that didn't have a clear margin but this still wouldn't have as good a cosmetic result as my initial lumpectomy, as it would leave a bit more of a dent. Her main concern was that the cancer turned out not to be one mass but a collection of smaller pockets. This could mean that the margins may not be clear even if she takes some more away and in 6 weeks time I would be back to having a discussion about a mastectomy. So although the cosmetic result forms part of the argument for for a mastectomy, it mainly down to the fact that the type of cancer is making it hard to predict where the margins might be. It's just left me in a bit of shock because I'd been so certain that my treatment path was going to be lumpectomy, radiotherapy then hormone therapy. I'm wondering if it worth taking a chance at re-excision x",

      "Content": "Hi Jo, Thank you for letting me know your experience of this. I am very grateful to have more information on which to base my decision. I was a bit thrown by the news that my surgeon gave me at my consultation and didn't really take a lot of it in after that, so I will definitely get back in contact with my BCN and do more research into reconstruction. Thank you once again for taking the time to help me with my decision. x ",

I'm guessing it was due to the type of cancer involved. All a bit of a surprise as they seemed so positive about the outcome before the op. Good luck for you surgery on 30th x",
