      "Content": "Hi eliza44  my Dcis was not seen on mammogram, neither was my small invasive, nor on uss or mri. I had a mastectomy, no recon. Surgeons are reluctant to remove healthy breast however many women have had a contralateral mastectomy (removal of healthy breast) because of genetic reasons or for symmetry. You are entitled to have your \u2018good\u2019 Breast removed for symmetry under Nice guidelines as I understand it. You usually need a psychologist report. There is a closed Facebook group called flat friends for women who are not having recon or considering it.... you may find it helpful regarding your decision making. xx",

      "Content": "Hi Addison  I was diagnosed March 21st (IDC) and my mammogram  at my initial referral appointment was reported as normal  even though there was a cancer ( I was a self referral). I had a routine mammogram last year reported as normal.   It does say in the information about mammogram that it\u2019s not 100% and that\u2019s why we need to be breast aware which you certainly were and are are now going to have treatment.  Choices are individual but you were given one so that is a good thing. Whatever choices we make are done for the right reasons with the information we have. You\u2019ll get a lot more info post surgery with your results  it is a scary time. There\u2019s a lot of the unknown, the waiting and anxiety/fear, interrupted sleep.... I started a diary, I find meditation  helps with anxiety, I try to be positive, I\u2019ve had my meltdown moments and I try and keep occupied . Youll get a lot of support/ information on here and there is the Breast cancer care site but you will be told to keep off Dr Google as there\u2019s a lot of rubbish out there. Xhugx",

I also think of those ladies who can\u2019t have recon so they\u2019ve no choice. There is a bigger uptake of recon these days but I don\u2019t know what the factors are eg. age for instance, more genetic testing, or availability. Having an implant is \u201c instantaneous \u201c, shorter op than flap recon and if any problems can be removed. I have yet to do research into them on types, safety aspects and how long they last etc, although I think it\u2019s 10-15 years. I\u2019ll certainly do more reading. xhugx",

      "Content": "Thanks Eddiboy I think going for DIEP is such a big decision just because of the surgery involved but it seems to give a more natural result and will change with weight gain/loss so you will definitely get the results you are looking for. I want to minimise surgery, have quick recovery so my gut feeling was no recon....flap surgery is definitely not for me. I\u2019m not very keen on having an implant either just not sure what it would be like, feel like and am conscious of the fact that it will need replacing at some time ... that\u2019ll take me well into my 70\u2019s if I\u2019m looking at max 15year life span of implant. If I go no recon I\u2019m hoping I\u2019ll adapt as well as I have following both recent surgeries where I have already lost nipple area and my small boob has become even smaller and an odd shape... still, the decision making process is giving me a headache and like you say I\u2019ll have to talk it through I\u2019ll write my list out of pros and cons but it\u2019s all down to feelings and at the minute I\u2019m going round in circles a bit... sorry for rambling on. I hope you mind settled during the night, + your hot flashes cooled down a bit, enough for you to get a bit of sleep. Hope your pre op assessment goes ok. You\u2019ll be away on your lovely holiday soon so you\u2019ll probably do a lot of walking then. I\u2019m intending to get out lots and get a bit fitter pre op... need to lose more weight and try and get rid of spare tyre. xhugsx",

      "Content": "Thanks ronstar....  I am trying to see the positives and keep that in mind but I\u2019m still in wobble mode. As you and Eddiboy say I can reconsider recon at a later date if I don\u2019t go with it now. I thought I would find the decision easier but I don\u2019t know how I\u2019ll feel post op without recon but that goes the same for having an implant too. Its a question of mindset and gut feelings I think.  It seems that surgeons and bcn\u2019s go into having recon straightaway because it\u2019s in Nice guidelines but they don\u2019t give having no recon any emphasis initially. I think they want to reassure that if wanted recon is available if mx is indicated. Hope you\u2019re having a good day so far xx",

I would expect Nicola Jane, amoena , womanzone would be ok but they are pricey. Asda do a tankini. You could get a non pocketed one, with high neckline, pre formed cups and have a pocket sewn in.

Although I had a GA the local worked the same. Wear a soft bra 24/7 for support and comfort post op. I did take paracetamol/ibuprofen regularly for at least a few days then just the paracetamol and used the Brufen  to top up as required for up to a week. Best wishes for your op.  Everyone seems to be active. Hope the vac dressings do the trick AnnJac  belated birthday wishes Sunnyone sounds as though youve been having a stressful time Violetsniff .. sending hugs. Im back to yoga, walking and gardening.... been a lovely day today...very sunny and warm   hugs to all xx",

      "Content": "Hi Baduki1 Im in the same situation having been told last week, after wle then re excision, that I will need mastectomy. I had the options put to me, have the reading material, have the bcn appointment next week and have asked questions/ had input/ read threads on here to gain some insight of pros/cons/adapting/experience etc etc.  It\u2019s a lot to take in especially when dealing with diagnosis at the same time...it\u2019s actually caused me a huge amount of stress thinking about it especially as I feel it\u2019s expected of me to automatically go for recon.  Im aware I\u2019ll be getting more results after mx and Im naturally cautious about it.  I know at this moment what I don\u2019t want and that is a huge op with all it implies, I\u2019m not keen on having an implant for lots of reasons. I do believe implants work better if having bilateral as they \u201cmatch\u201d.  I don\u2019t really want to have further surgery in the future if I can help it  (unless of course it\u2019s to save my life for example) .... there may be complications and sometimes there are other procedures to complete the process or to get the best possible results of the recon....I think that will depend on an individuals expectations. Implants usually have to be replaced  sometime although I\u2019ve heard of a few still going after 20+ yrs. Not having recon and waiting may be my best option as Im no where near being 100% for it and many have said that if there\u2019s any doubts wait. I\u2019ve had really positive input from women from age 40\u2019s to 70\u2019s who have no recon and are living happy, active lives. We are all individuals and will make different decisions for different reasons.  Whatever decision you make will be right for you xhugsx",

All the women are living flat, that is have not had recon, or are waiting for recon after mx, or have been deconstructed and living flat. You may find it helpful, supportive and can join the closed group if you so wish. Xx",

      "Content": " Hi RoseKen1 I had to make the same decision as you after I\u2019d had a lumpectomy and re excision. I\u2019m 63. . Having to decide about recon confused the issue for me and I became really quite stressed over it in spite of thinking that no recon would be the best option for me.  I did get input from lovely women on here and after weighing up the pros and cons, writing them down, I had a mastectomy, no recon 3 months ago.  My OH was fully supportive. I am happy with my decision. In some ways I prefer my flat side. It is odd at first but I got used to it really quick. The scar will fade over time. It\u2019s easy to examine the area too.   I went out the day after my op and felt confident and not self conscious. I used a front fastening soft bra and a softie and dressed looked my usual self. I do go out \u2018flat\u2019 as well, in fact I didn\u2019t notice I was flat one day until after I\u2019d been out, round a supermarket and walking around town....I don\u2019t think anyone noticed and even when I realised I wasn\u2019t phased at all.  Good luck with your decision and future surgery. Whatever you decide will be right for you.  Hugs xx",

I was so undecided I put off surgery for a week...and I\u2019d already had 5 weeks of going into ostrich mode (surgeon on hols at that time). I\u2019ve not had rads or chemo but I\u2019m quite happy to answer questions about mastectomy and afterwards, on here or via pm. There is lots of support on here and it\u2019s great you are going to a support night locally.  Hugs xx",

I eventually had a mastectomy and a further node taken was clear as was an intermammary node. I\u2019ve had no other treatment.. no rads/chemo and I\u2019m on Letrozole. ",
