    "Content": "Hello, I was told I had breast cancer few days ago, whole range of emotions since then. Mines grade 2 invasive ductal and consultant thinks it's in lymph nodes too. Had 6 biopsies so far and one of them was bloody painful coz not enough local was given. Had numerous blood tests, got MRI mammogram tomorrow, maybe a full body scan too at some point then back to see consultant Thurs next week to find full results, staging and treatment plan. It's been a whirlwind and not even started properly yet. Add me as a friend if u like, we can share this rollercoaster together.",
