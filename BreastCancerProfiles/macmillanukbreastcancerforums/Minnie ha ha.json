    "Content": "Hi all, I am new to this so not quite sure what to say. I have been reading your post and am amazed at how different everyone's experience has been. I am due to start my first session of FEC/T on Wednesday and I am absolutely terrified. I have tried to be positive and prepare myself but the nearer it gets the more terrified I become. Keep telling my family that I will be ok as I am a tough old bird because I don't want them to worry but deep down I want to scream!!!",
