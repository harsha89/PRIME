    "Content": "Hi, I am currently going through treatment for BC and thought I was doing really well.  And then I spoke to my Occupational Health advisor through work on the phone and had a mini meltdown. She recommended that I seek counselling but I thought she was being a bit dramatic. This was on Friday morning and on Friday afternoon I had a physio appointment at the breast clinic. As I left there I decided to pop in to \u2018Maggies\u2019 which is right next door. There was a lovely lady there who welcomed me, made me a cuppa and asked what me why I had wandered over there? It was like someone had opened the flood gates. The lady listened to me and then asked me if I would like to see her again for 1 to 1 counselling (she obviously thought I needed it)  i have my first session with her on Wednesday so no waiting for 4-6 weeks. I think if I had been told that I just wouldn\u2019t have bothered asking again and god only knows where that would have left me. I would try and find a Maggies centre if you can as I think they could help you.  My thoughts are with you and I really hope you find someone that will help you soon Sarah x",
