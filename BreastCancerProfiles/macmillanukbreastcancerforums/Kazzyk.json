    "Content": "Hi Katie, hope your chemo goes well. I am currently on chemo for liver cancer and can share my experiences. Drinking any fluid is good, I personally can't drink water, tea or coffee as it all tastes metallic. In fact my taste for drinks changes on a daily basis. Some of the foods you love will also change in taste due to the metallic element. I was told eating with plastic cutlery would help, this I found to be true. I was also told the more you drink the quicker the chemo gets out of your system which can only be a good thing. You probably won't feel like eating much, try to eat little and often as it's important to maintain a healthy weight. If you haven't got one it might be an idea to get a thermometer, I found mine invaluable as you have to be so careful with your temperature. Rest when your body tells you to. I hope your treatment goes well, my best wishes to your sister. xx",
