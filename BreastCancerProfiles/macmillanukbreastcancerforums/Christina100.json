    "Content": "Hey im totally new to this site. I have today been diagnosed with stage 3 breast cancer. The surgeon who told me said hes pretty confident it hasnt spread to my lymph nodes but needs to do mri and ct to check. My familys in bits. Ive seen some grim stories about survival rates for grade 3 so be good to hear that theres a good chance i will beat it. Has anyone else had this and beat it. So scared cant eat and my brain wont stop overthinking.",
