      "Content": "Hi everyone  I have been logged onto the website and just never knew how to make a start on a discussion. so here I go, i'm 25 and got diagnosed in june this year, everything moved so fast to start off with. I went to the doctor with a lump the next day the hospital called for me to go in the following week, i had an ultra sound followed by a mammogram followed bu the core byopsy, the following week it was confirmed as breast cancer.... still seems surreal. I have since had genetic testing, 5 chemo (3 ec, 2doctax)  and 3 MRI scans so far the Chemo hasn't changed the lump. I haven't had any surgery yet for the cancer or in fact ever and now it's getting closer its getting more real. I have been reading a lot of the discussions so thought i would finally be brave and write!!",

      "Content": "Hi everyone   I was wondering if there is anyone who can help with some advice on children. I have 5 year old boy who is amazing he knows what he needs to know about whats happening but recently he has started acting out. He lashes out and I hate having to tell him off because I feel so guilty as he doesn't relly know whats going on. I worry this will effect him massively.   Any advice would be great   J x",

      "Content": "HI Kiera I exactly the same with sickness, the anti sickness drugs they give you are really good I was a little sick but it was very short lived the sickness went as fast as it came. They will explain they dont want you to be sick so they will help you with it. I would advise to talk to them about what worries you and tell them what your feeling while having the chemo and you'll find its all pretty normal.  First chemo is so difficult because you don;t know what to expect but thhey are there to look after you and to help you stay comfortable through the treatment and after. I hope this is some help. Good luck with your treatment. When is your first chemo?7 J x",

I'm taking the Tramadol for the aches and pains and enjoying the well deserved rest we need!! it takes the pain away but i would start off with just the one and a couple paracetamol, two may be a little strong. Wish i had more to give to make you smile, i guess i've found knowing I'm not alone and feeling the same makes things just a little bit easier!!   Ps ... not a wimp another strong lady! x",
