      "Content": "Hi Jackie aka Boudicca1970 Today is day 6 post my first MrT. The symptoms appeared on day 3, I was taken one tablet of 30/500 co-codimol four times per day. But I did not work. I had a body of 100 years old. So so tormentingly painful everywhere! I do not know how to describe. I could not even climb the stairs. From today I have increased co-codimol to maximum. It is hiding the pain, kind of.... There are three filgastrim injections left so I reckon  I may feel better by Thursday/Friday. I also do not have any taste. I had a piece of chocolate but it did not trigger any emotions! My nose is not bleeding but if I blow it, then  red stuff is coming out. My face is gleaming hot too. Fingers are strangely sore and I cannot even pick up a tablet from a package. I cry late at night. Xmas does not associate with all these mess.  The family  will be doing Xmas (including cooking). I cannot even hold a glass of water. I do not feel like me. Sorry I did not mean to complain but Mr T is truly challenging. Fingers crossed, he works hard to do his job properly HopeRu",

I could not bear to drink a tapped water, tea, squashes. Just in case as you need to drink a lot. wishing you goodluck.   x",

It is always nice to have lots of choices rather then no choices. And that PICC line- It would be nice to heal! Fingers crossed for you,  it will be coming out soon!! I have seen my oncologist today to review my symptoms after 1st MrT.  She was quite bothered by my tingly fingers and decided that MrT#3 might be lower but  MrT #2 is to be the full doze.  Apparently the side effects on docetaxel are not easing off  as we progress the treatment. So I have to carry on here. I am planning to have painkillers on day 2. She kept  me on co-codimol.  Other wise I am good and looking forward to my Xmas. Hug  HopeRu",

      "Content": "Hello Boxerfan1 Everything depends on your fitness level I would say. I am recovering really well. My family is very pleased.  I did not have any treatments recently so I am relatively healthy and fit. I was told to have bilateral mastectomy with immediate reconstruction  as I cannot have RT. I am Hodgkin Lymphoma survivor.   Obviously any flap recon is a huge deal for your body. But it is worth it. I think it is absolutely right decision for me. The first 4 days in the hospital are very manageable as nurses were looking after me so well. I had lots of painkillers.I was up sitting in my chair the following day, and strolled through hospital corridors on the 3rd day as soon as nurses removed the catheter.  1st week at  home was tricky as I needed to readjust my habits, sleeping position, sitting position etc. I showered without any help. I cooked all my meals as I found it is difficult to sustain old eating habits because my tummy was too tight at the beginning. The family did all the shopping, washing etc. The second week - I enjoined outing with my family but was getting tired  and needed a nap After 3rd week when I took off blood-clot-preventing medical socks, I was off to walk outside for 30 min on my own. I am trying to do it twice per day. I would not lie, it is not easy but I have to keep moving. I feel weary around lots of people as I feel weaker. I am not ready for a commute yet.  I am 3.5 weeks post surgery and getting better and better everyday. I can not complain about anything: I am walking straighter. I am sleeping like a log. I am taking Paracetamol only I do not drive yet. I feel I can but I would not. I plan to drive after 6 weeks -insurance reasons. the same as for C-section. I do all exercises. All is going well now. Next level of exercises I will be starting at the end of this week. It would be about the strength in my arms  as they are quite weak now but it is OK Showers are revitalizing  and wonderful thing to relax after I walk in a hook position. I tend to hook by 6 p.m. I find slightly uncomfortable especially around tummy area to sit  for a long period . But  moving and exercising help. BCNs are angels who are keeping me sane if I worry too much. To get ready- think of how you will be getting in and out of bed. Your home bed differs from the hospital bed. (practice it and research- for me yoga forward roll was a key) how you will be getting up from the chair (no arms/clinch you butt)- 1st two weeks underwear - you are going to wear it 24/7, OK 23/7 for 6 weeks- 1 hour for shower and changing. I wrote somewhere else before what I chose hair dryer- you need one with a cool air function to dry your dressing thoroughly.  how to put on those medical socks  -  (i) we found that the plastic packaging of those socks is to be put on a foot, (ii) my husband puts the sock on and over the heel (it  slides on plastic  easier) (iii) I pull up the sock.  (iv) There is a hole at the bottom of the sock  which is ideal to pull out the plastic packaging.  SO do not through away the plastic packaging. It will make sense later! two small pillows for seat belt in the car- for breast and for tummy. I had one and it was not enough for me your food, which will help you to  heal better. I cannot stuff my tummy, it feels so uncomfortable. This delights my teenage son as when we had a takeaway he ate 3/4 of my meal on top of his. some laxatives ready at home as some pain killers will make your constipate. your tummy will be screaming at you. little thing before your op- have a pedicure as you would not be able to bend easily. I hope all will go well for you and I will be thinking of you and keeping my fingers cross. Hug HopeRu PS Sorry I am trying to be concise and not be a repetitive bore.",

      "Content": "Hi All I would like to start a new thread about post\u2013op exercises and eating for DIEPers and TRAMers. In the middle of August this year I had double mastectomy with immediate DEIP flap reconstruction (for clarity, some lymphs  were removed- sorry I do not know yet how many. I will find out later on this week- I am scared about this and not talking about this aspect now) and I am doing all exercises  as prescribed by my hospital physiotherapist ( she provided some notes).  I do not take any more painkillers. I do not have pain but have twicky sensation of \u201cpain and needles\u201d in my breasts and it feels as if I have an annoying ball in my armpit where the lymph node was removed.  Because of this pain in my armpit I found the hardest exercise is \u201cActive Assisted Flexion\u201d, which basically is a straight lift of both arms over head and a hold for 5 seconds.  Ouch! The first time I did, I could not believe how hard it was. What is your experience? How do you find your exercise? Do they help? Do you have any advice/tips regarding exercises for your tight tummys? Mine is tight and still swollen, not as swollen as 7 days ago. It got better especially when I came off  painkillers which were the main cause of constipation,  but it is still far away from being comfortable \u2026 I would like a little bit softer tummy. I have changed my diet as I cannot keep up with my family\u2019s eating pace anymore and my teenagers\u2019 eating habits.   Please share your experience and words of wisdom. Hugs and Thank you x HopeRu",

      "Content": "Hi All I found the filgastrim injections is OKish. I cannot do them into a layer of stomach (I had a DIEP so no fat left to grab!), so I pinch my thighs and alternate them every time, left/right... Before starting the injections I read thoroughly the instructions enclosed with the injections and they are full of great hints. It is worth reading several times (I did as I have a chemo brain) to absorb all the information. I do my injection just  before my bed time so I can go straight to bed and relax. I unfortunately noticed that I had  unpleasant low back pain and needed some painkillers, especially after 1st FEC and 1st T. 1 st FEC especially took me by surprise on day #7 or #10 (sorry do not remember exactly when).  I  had to rush for painkillers and stayed in bed for the whole day. But we all are different and maybe it is just me. The only thing I know that filgastrim is a wonderful drug which helps so much to keep up the blood!. Last time (some 25 years ago) when I had my chemo for Hodgkin, we always worried about  leukocytes diving down, not moving up and therefore causing delays in chemo treatments. Now there have been so much progress and filgastrim is doing amazing job. Thank you clever biomedics for all your hard work and the progress made! Hug HopeRu",

Plus it worries me that part of my body will not be having the chemo treatment. All hustle, pain, discomfort  of chemo treatment!.  I will be cancelling this cold cap! Am I overreacting? Hug HopeRu",

Just my gut feeling, even though i have a mane.  I bought my scarfs and beanies from Primark this morning. Hug HopeRu PS: I like you name- down to earth, steady and no sense!",

      "Content": "Morning all Nice to hear from Hdsurvivor. 32 years is impressive! Well done!! It is good that more people are joining our little group. It would be easier for anyone who went through RT in the past to find the references etc. I was recommended to have CT ( FEC-T) for my breast cancer, mainly because of  (i) my age (under 50) and (ii) it is triple negative. But it makes sense not to have any CT after bilateral mastectomy  if breast cancer appeared to be highly hormone positive like in your case Hdsurvivor.  What was your breast cancer type Takamak? Hdsurvivor- I just want to say that I am very-very pleased with skin-spring bilateral mastectomy with immediate DIEP. I could not wish for anything else taking into account the inevitable and very emotional upheaval to loose my breasts. I am one month after the surgery and the boobs feel like mine!!! Honestly. I have previously replied to a post why I have chosen DIEP. Here is the link to that thread which is in \"Breast Cancer in the under-50\" https://community.macmillan.org.uk/cancer_experiences/breast_cancer_for_the_under_50s/f/30303/p/136032/1060396#1060396 Take care Hugs HopeRu",

      "Content": "Hi Kim I am Hodgkin Lymphoma Survivor of 25 years. In May 2017 my Mammo showed 1.5 cm calcification.... Oops!  So I was told to have double mastectomy because of RT. Any HL survivors as everybody else in fact who had RT can have RT only once.  So here I am with my lovely new breasts thanks to my skillful amazing surgeons who did skin sparing double mastectomy with immediate DIEP flap reconstruction.  The post - op biopsy showed that my breast cancer is triple negative, which is very common for women who had chest RT in the past.  As they say TNBC is a price of success  paid by HL survivors. I will be meeting my oncologist soon to discuss  the next steps... I am still trying to get my head around all the abbreviation and medication for breast cancer. I am quite good with hematological aspect of chemo treatment.  So Chemo treatments for TNBC will be my next specialty...   How are you doing now? It would be great to hear from you and  of course all others.   Hug HopeRu xxx",

      "Content": "Hello Pakamac Nice to know that I am not alone. I think you should query why bilateral mastectomy was not offered to you. You were diagnosed in 2016.The link between mantle RT and breast cancer was really well known by then.  I read in several publications that women who received chest radiation for Hodgkin lymphoma were at nearly identical risk for the development of breast cancer as women who have BRCA1 mutations (31% vs. 30%) and had 3 times the risk of those with BRCA2 mutations by age 50 years.  Offering BRCA-positive women the option of prophylactic bilateral mastectomy is a increasingly commonplace.  Therefore for any Hodgkin survivor (especially over 20 years) it would make  sense to have the same treatment, i.e. bilateral mastectomy.  That is what I was told by my doctors at the breast screening clinic too: my left breast was out as it had a cancer, my right breast was out for the prophylactic reason!   No choices. I had  a choice of reconstruction though. Have you been offered any chemo treatment?  I am researching this subject now before my meeting with oncologist so I am roughly ready to comprehend all options and risks. hug HopeRu",
