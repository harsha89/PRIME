      "Content": "Just finished my chemo last Thursday, journey ahead is bilateral mastectomy radiotherapy with reconstruction next summer. My husband gave his job up to become my carer. Today I feel like I am loosing it with my anger. The stress and pressure is certainly getting to me. I decided last week to have some counselling sessions, but my husband is not a person that believes in this. I am so afraid that this journey is going to come between the two of us, we been married for almost 30 years. I never ever thought this big C would get this hard . I am a strong person but it really is taking its toll on me",

      "Content": "I totally agree to everything you said , it's makes you look at things and people in a different light. But it can be hurtful too when you feel let down. My anger really is quite bad and a feel very hurt from my work colleagues. I feel completely isolated from work when I thought this would be a place where I would get the support. My husbands tells me to just let it go over my head , people like this he says are weak and shellfish , but it doesn't help the way you feel at such a mad time. This journey will make me stronger. And for years the easies thing to say is No",

It isn't that HR haven't contacted me , my inline manager never contacts me I haven't even had as much of a get well card, this as made me feel very isolated to a job I valued. But most of all let down. They already advertise my role so I was feel I wasn't a good assert there",

He really been my strength thou, but I think I need to open up with someone who hasn't got the emotional contention. It really is a hard road one I thought being a little easier. Friends have been fanatic but my work collugues I feel have let me down which upsets me when I really did enjoy my work. I sent an email to HR today briefly in a respect for way , asking why they don't contact me. This also worries me too because I have been on the sick now for 6 months will they start procedures to get rid of me.",

      "Content": "I due to under go bilateral mastectomy with reconstruction all in one operation. Just started chemo so I think this operation will take place hopefully November. it is a big discussion weeble but I really want to keep my own body , so I have been offered reconstruction using my stomach fat which I have looked into and this gives a more natural look. Plus if I put weight on or lose weight so do the boobs. It is a very long operation 12 hours I was told but I absolute hate being put to sleep so me personally would go for a option where I am only put to sleep once. I spoke to a lady last night who's mum had the same op and said it had amazing results    it's very hard to make these choices but saying that the whole journey is hard love Diane x",
