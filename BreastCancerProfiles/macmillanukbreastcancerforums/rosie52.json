What persuaded me was the quicker recovery time and no stomach weakness, so I could get onto chemo and get this nightmare over quicker. Must say though I have heard you get a more natural result and a tummy tuck thown in, so maybe the extra recovery could be worth it for you, hopefully someone who has had the diep flap will post as well. Good luck",

      "Content": "Hi Ladies I have been asked to take part in the Supremo trial for ladies with an intermediate risk of recurrance.  I have had a mx and undergoing chemo at the moment.  I was told if I don't take part in the trial I would'nt have radio (I have had an implant so there is a small risk of damage to that anyway). So now I am torn between helping out in a trial for future benefits and maybe my own as well if I get the radio treatment, or saying no as the radio is a time consuming and possibley pointless for me anyway. Has anyone else had to make this decision?",

      "Content": "Hi Sue Thanks for you post, it really helped make my mind up to hear of someone else going through the same process.  I have decided not to go ahead with the trial and like you am already on one trial anyway, the poetic trial although I was one of the ones who didn't get the drugs to take. Good luck for the future.",

      "Content": "Hi Saxxy Thanks for your reply.  Just to clear up a misunderstanding, they said in the normal run of things I wouldn't be offered radio anyway.  Its just a trail that I believe has been running a few years now that wants to see if there is any benefit to intermediate radio ladies.  They said I can agree to trial but still decline if I get picked for treatment.  Obviously the time involved and another 3 weeks of hardly getting any work done (I am working from home)  against a very small potential benefit, but of course if no one went on any trials we might not be in such a good position today.",
