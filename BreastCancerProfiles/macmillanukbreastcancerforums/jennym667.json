      "Content": "Hi M65, I had same issue but before I even got first FEC session. I found I was dreading them trying to find a vein more than the treatment, I had two bad appts before I opted for Hickman line, one was for a scan and they were in my wrists and everything and the second was supposed to be my first chemo session but they couldn't get a cannula in so I was sent away. So as I say I had a Hickman line fitted two days ago and my first session of FEC went well yesterday. I had the line fitted under a general which only took 15 mins. I'm a bit tender but for me this was much preferable than having to go through any more issues with them not managing to get needles in me as I was finding it very stressful like you. The only downside is that the hickman line has to be flushed once a week which can be done either by your GP if they have had the training or your hospital. I wouldn't hesitate to have the line fitted as once its in then there are no more needles as they can inject anything through hickman and also take blood from it. The line can stay in for the duration of my treatment and as far as I know is removed by nurse under local. There's a few folk on here had hickman lines fitted. I think that PICC and Hickman lines are similar. Feel free to message me if you have any further questions. Kind regards Jenny",

I ended up having to take a couple of Laxido to get going but it has settled down now that I've started eating again. I would give your your BC nurse or NHS24 a call just for reassurance as I've already called them a couple of times and they're fabulous :) Best wishes Jenny",

      "Content": "Hi Ladies, Just wanted to throw in my tuppence worth. I found a lump in my left breast between xmas and new year '13, diagnosed at age 32  TNBC, grade 3 1 tumour. I've completed 6 cycles of FEC-T, last 2 Docetaxol had to be reduced to 80% as the bone joint pain was too bad for me, couldn't stand. I had a lumpectomy 2 days ago which appears to have gone well. Find out on 14th if they are happy with the margins and if the 2 lymph nodes were OK. And then its on to Radiotherapy. The start of this journey was a dark time as it was for everyone, terrible mood swings etc. Friends and family plus this forum and the Younger Breast Cancer Forum on Facebook got me through it. Its hard work but it is do-able. Lost all my hair through chemo but its started coming back in which is fabulous :) The NHS have been tremendous for me, between Borders General Hospital near Galashiels and the Western in Edinburgh. I know its a bit of a postcode lottery for treatment but I've been lucky. To anyone starting this journey, take care, accept help from your friends and family and have faith in the NHS as they are fabulous. Jenny",

      "Content": "I should also clarify that I have had atleast 3 1hr breaks on couch today and back on it now, I've not really been running about like an arse all day. But then I should prob also admit that I ended up in A&E 2 nights ago as was having palpitations after walking too far with dogs. Palpitations didn't settle so I called NHS24 who sent paramedics who got an abnormal ECG reading but once I was in hosp they had normal ECG reading and my bloods came back fine so it was decided I'd just done too much. So perhaps today is just the delayed reaction from that. Argh I'm an idiot",

      "Content": "So angry tonight, today I have been really tired. Didn't get very far with dogs this morning, managed to get a bit housework done, feed my garden birds. My sis came round to visit this afo with her boyfriend and they kindly took my dogs out for an hrs walk which was great as although I'm getting them out, they're not getting as much exercise as I'd like. Then walked my dogs again tonight but I am cream crackered. Trembly muscles and basically have to sit down or I will fall down. I'm angry as I am such an active person, hill walking, dogs, horses, etc and I feel like my life has ended. I'm in definite victim mode tonight and I've done nothing but eat today as well which doesn't help as I'm worried about putting on a lot of weight. I'm on day 10 today after first chemo session. I just feel like smashing something up, I'm so frustrated at my body letting me down like this. I feel I'm continually apologising to boyfriend as well for being a moody cow to him as well. Admittedly he's being a crabbit git today as well so he's not all the golden boy. I know I need to listen to my body and when it tells me to rest, I should rest but I'm just having a mare today. I'm in tears typing this but really I just want to smash the place up. I need to find more sedentary but stimulating stuff to do in the house/garden. Its been pants weather today I suppose. Maybe I need to make a list of everything I do each day as well so I can better recognise my achievements, even if it is just getting dressed! Does anyone on chemo do anything like Yoga or Tai Chi? I love Zumba but recognise that's beyond me but wondering if there is an alternative. I think I am pushing my body too hard, I recognise that from reading my message back but is there an element when pushing yourself is beneficial? Jenny",

      "Content": "Hi Chiara, I had same pretty much same diagnosis as your mum. Don't get too bogged down with the terminology and don't try googling stuff on internet as a lot of it is out of date and it just confuses you. Breast cancer is very treatable and the doctors will take good care of your mum. There is a carers section on this forum that you might want to look at registering on. I've done chemo and a lumpectomy (keyhole), I only had one lump and mine wasn't hereditary so I didn't need preventative surgery (mastectomy). I'm waiting for results of surgery, i.e are they happy that they've taken out all the lump etc. You should try and get your mum to register on here as well as she will benefit as well. If no that it sounds like you will be able to help her with the online stuff. There are some great people on here that will be able to help you with any questions you or your mum may have. There are also a couple of groups on facebook at as well if you want to look on there too. The great thing about forums like this is that you can speak to people that are at same stage as your mum or get advice from people that are further on in treatment and can give support using their own experiences. Take care x Jenny",

      "Content": "Hi, Good luck today :) I'm back in for my 2nd FEC next week so I'm one ahead of you.  I'll give you the advice I was given on here as it was good advice: Drink plenty water as your doing to flush the poison out Remember Chemo is your friend, its battering the nasty cancer You'll prob get a party bag of pills away from the clinic, keep on top of the nausea pills even if your not feeling sick as its easier to prevent it than stop it once its started. Main side effects for the FEC is nausea, if you get bother with acid reflux as I did then go to the GP and ask for omeprezole, its great. If you have a symptom that worries you don't hesitate to call either you breast cancer nurse or NHS 24 out of hours, theyre great and it really puts your mind at rest. Don't worry in silence, you have enough to contend with. And keep coming on here, the people are fab. I have unloaded on here a few times and it really helps. Take care and let us know how you get on :) Jenny x",

      "Content": "Morning Rebecca, I think you just just have to look at it as another hurdle that you will cross, you know you will because you've already listed the massive journey you have already made. I find I cope with humour, a case of for me that if I didn't laugh I'd greet (cry, Scottish twang sorry!). Chin up, I read your blog and was so impressed at your positivity but it is reassuring in a way that we can all have a wobble, reminds us we are human. Just away and smash something up that can't fight back, chair/garden bush, recycling, bucket etc, always helps me, good rant also helps me, I develop potty mouth in times of trauma. All the best Jenny x",
