    "Content": "Hi I was diagnosed with Breast Cancer whish th TNT on the 23 September 2008, initially by consultant said that he could feel no lump but would send me for the usual mam and utrasound on mam and utralsound a small cancerouse lump was pick up and consequently a biopsy was done. On returning to the consultant he words were what have you been told I explained and he said it was actually 1.2cm lump and it was in the Duct , but because of the way it presented itself he want to do an MRI but would book surgery for the 31st October for Lumpectomy or Mastectomy and Sentinal Node biopsy. Anyway went bact for results of MRI to be told that the tumor was actually 5 cm and again with no lumph node invasion. But he would like me to have another biopsy take from the edge of tumor to see was the whole thing was cancerous and that obviously lumpectomy was not a option because of size but he would still to the node biopsy. Went for second biopsy and the the Dr asked if she had scanned under my arm I said that I could not remember so she decided to take a look and found an enlarge node ha ha another mistake so an aspiration was taken. Anyway returned a week later to be told that the whole tumor was cancerous and that there were cancer cells in the lymph node so then comes the news that I have to have the staging test ie lung/heart xray, bone scan and liver scan which thankfully have come back clear. I was then told that I would have to have chemo before anything else which I have had the first session. I have just been to my GP and he has finally received a letter from my consultant contridicting everything that he has told me. apparently on initialy diagnoses the lump was 2.3 cm and not the 1.4 cm and he refers to the cancer as Inflamatory Breast Cancer and not ductil as confirmed to me by my consultant. My trust in my consulting is depleating. I am too far down the line to get a second opinion now but my GP has asked for my histoligy to be review by an independed professional and another thing even after the cancerous lump being found my consultant has never examined me since or made any apology, my GP examined me and felt the lump straight away. Please help and give me some advice.",
