I knew this wasnt right so i went to gp today she examined me ... said it is swollen and a lump but its loose .. and its about 5cm .. but when i compare it to my other i thought it was just  matching  tissues within. Im scared im a single parent with two beautiful boys 5 and 7.  How can i not see it before or notice .. why today and h8w can it be 5cm!! 5cm thats not a good sign .it surely spread if that big?!  I want to see my children grow up ... sounds ridiculous i dont even have any answers but i have so much in my head...  I have life insurance but i am a non smoker ..ok i go out occasionaly and have a fag with my drink when out but i not regular she asked me that at gp and i said that also worries that now effect my insurance ..if i go i want to pay house off so boys ok ... but know they are worms and get out of anything...  A million thoughts so ridiculous .. i am try7ngbto reopen my business after my patner leaving me a year and half ago... I just wanna see my boys grow up ....im sorry i sound pathetic but i habe no answers and i just cant clear my head ... my friends coming tonight  I habent told anyone.. she will be the only one...
