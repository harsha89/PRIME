      "Content": "Hi , I am doing my second tax on thursday following 3 fec, I found the fec easier than the tax,I was very sick the first time but this was due to them forgetting to give me any anti sickness tabs till it was too late,the next times still had some nausea but not bad,constipated due to the anti sickness tabs but i didnt take anything and this sorted itself out in a week.just feel vaguely hungover for a week really and some headaches. I had pretty much the same steroid dosage for both tax and fec and have had completly different side effects so I cant blame the steroids as everyone else seems to. I have used the cold cap which I dont like but I still have enough hair to not bother with covering my head .I have pretty thin fine hair so I  go against the theory re thick hair.my theory is that as it is thin the cold cap is more efficient and cooling my scalp.Anyway what i am trying to say is that you might not loose anymore hair. goodluck for thursday",

After my success with keeping my hair ,the nurses all seemed to take more care with the cold cap for people and leave it on for the correct time after etc my hair definately thinned but was presentable enough for me.My main worry was that it would come back grey and again the nurse was fairly negative about the fact that at my age 47 it was likely to. Where I did loose it it has grown back thicker and darker than it has ever been!",

From reading other posts(bongo) on here it also seems a bit strange re no talk of other therapies and  I presume you must be ER +ve as well. Anyway hoping that you will get some of your questions answered and will be able to get some sleep and relaxation whilst waiting for scan and result",

If it is being offered I would definately go for it.

Putting your chemo back a lttle bit wont matter and it would be good to get your mind around it and talk to some people if you can. I dont know how old your kids are? Mine are 9 and 7,I am 10 days after my 5th chemo,3 FEC and 2 TAX so far .one more to go. During the FEC ,I often felt a bit of a fraud and the 2nd and third weeks really carried on as normal ,gardening/holidays/ fitting kitchens etc. The tax does seem to be harder going as the effects seem to go on longer,this second one has been easier as the kids are back at school.Alot of the sie effects I have had are more annoying and get you down abit (sore nose,dry skin,feeling like you are eating cardboard for days on end) they have not effected the care of my children (unless you call an incredibly messy house as an effect) I do seem to have been \"lucky\" so far as have not had any major infections needing antibiotics but I dont know what the actual statistics are for the rate of neutropaenic sepsis for people having chemo and as dream thief often says the people who write on here are going to tend to be those that are having a rough time don't know if any of that helps Katharine",

You must make sure that the cap fits as the top of my head where I could feel that there was always a bit of a gap between cap and head has lost a fair bit of hair. It does seem quite an individual thing as my hair seems to hold on tight generally as I have kept a fair bit of all parts of my body hair! Good luck in your decision making, generally it seems although we all worry about hair loss to begin with as people move on through treatment hair loss becomes a much more minor issue compared to the potential  consequences of not having treatment",

I found a lump 8 weeks later ,had previous cysts and just had normal mammogram waited another 3 months ,further mammogram normal but u/s should something Now had my 3rd FEC for lymph node positive 18mm tumour. I obviously have some issues i havent fully resolved yet about this. The surgeon who i trust assures me both sets of mammograms are normal.this is the problem with screening mammograms in the under 50's they arent great. the u/s is another issue ,i think it must have been missed and like you am not sure what or not to do.the u/s is dynamic therefore much more difficult to prove anything the films of the u/s have gone missing but i could request some more. Sorry this isnt much help to you but good for me to write it down",

I found chemo a doddle compared to this ,I didnt cry during chemo but now everytime I get into the changing room after the treatment i have a little cry and I havent remembered to take tissues yet! With chemo i found that \"I only had cancer a few days every 3 weeks\" now \"i have cancer everyday\" if you see what I mean. will send you a private message soon but look after yourself",

I cant help you much with your other queries as I am just post 1st FEC and was very sick! sending my support to you from France Katharine",

So although at times my, like everyones, journey was hard at the moment I am able to reep the benefits ,as I hope all of you going through the hard parts of treatment at the moment will be able to in future. I will get back on here next week when hopefully it is all done to write about the things I have found usefull about getting back to some sort of fittness. In the mean time if anyone  is watching the telly on Sunday I have Kath99 on my MACMILLAN shirt.",
