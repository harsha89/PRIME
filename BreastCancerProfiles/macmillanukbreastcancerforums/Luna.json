      "Content": "Morning All, Am feeling a bit antsy as I have been told by my oncologist, yet again, they might have to delay my chemo start up date on a account of a skin infection that developed on my lumpectomy incision. Note to others... don't go to the gym even though the doctor clears you ready for exercise. I was on an antibiotic, Keflex, and had an allergic reaction in the way of hives! I found out the hard way that I was allergic to the med after taking Keflex for about 9 days. I broke out in hives shortly after the 9th day. On Wed, Sept. 9th, I called the oncologist's nurse and was told to stop taking Keflex and see my surgeon about my situation and to take Benedryl. Luckily, I was able to squeeze in an appt. with my surgeon who in turn agreed that, yes, I am allergic to Keflex and referred me to an Infectious Diseases Specialist! On Thurs, Sept. 10, I went to see the I. D. doctor, lovely man with great bedside manners, and he agreed with the others about it being a classic case of an allergic reaction to a drug. He said my infection is probably a STAPH infection and, therefore, I would require another antibiotic, Avelox and Hydroxyzine, to further treat the infection. Just as well as Benedryl was not doing a thing for the hives. On Friday,Sept. 11th, I met with my cardiologist and filled him in on the saga. I was referred to a cardiologist as I am going to be on Hercepin. He will be following me up while I am on chemo. My 9 year old daughter, by the way, started school on September 9, 2009. I was very happy for her as she is starting 3rd Grade. Even though it was beautiful day, I wore a sweater as I didn't want to bring further attention to the lovely patch work on my arms and hands. Thank heaven, her 1st day of school was wonderful! I need to say that, yes, my daughter does know I was diagnosed with cancer and about the chemo. Over the summer, I took her wig shopping with me and found one that is similar to my hair color. The organization gives free wigs and hats to women battling cancer. A wonderful program! My daughter helped pick out hats and was given one of her very own! Oh, yes, I forgot to mention that I have a port insert scheduled for Tues. Sept. 15th. I was told the antibiotic will not interfere with surgery. Now, I must call the oncologist once again to see whether we can keep the Sept. 24th date for chemo as the antibiotic is only for seven days. I will keep my fingers crossed all goes well. Prayers and good wishes much appreciated. I feel I have been caught in limbo, yet again! All this drama is not good. Have to see the lighter side of things; otherwise, my nerves will get the better of me. If nothing else, I will get to keep my black locks for a longer period! Best to all! God bless you too. Luna",
