      "Content": "Hi Becci, I have had two sessions of EC and am having my third on Friday. I have used the cold cap and actually found it quite pleasant! The onco nurse said that it is usually older people who have trouble tolerating it. My hair has thinned a bit, and there are little patches of very fine hair above my ears, but it is no more noticeable than someone with fine hair. I have a defined straight fringe and the thinning is most noticeable at the parting so I think a lot depends on your hairstyle. On sunny days I tend to have sunglasses on my head which disguises the line. I don't know how long I will keep my hair but trying is making me feel like I am doing something! I'd say give it a go and if you don't like it you can take it off. Best of luck x",

I had to call emergency oncology because of the pain of tongue ulcers but after the first round I was fine. The doc prescribed co codamol, which helped, but after the first session it never hurt as much. Have difflam mouthwash prescribed and that really helps. I had a really bad twitchy face side effect due to the anti emitics but didn't realise that what caused it. if you have any side effects then tell them straight away  as i suffered for weeks for n o reason. EC makes you very tired for a week after and suffering a weird jet lag experience.  tax has been a breeze in comparison. Best of luck! x",

I have had 2 more rounds of EC without steroids the latest one made me feel very sick but I was only sick 2 days. The original plan was to now have 3 sessions of doxitaxel sp? However they cant give that without steroids so my consultant is talking to my mental health worker to agree what is best. I'm so scared of not getting the strong chemo I need and dying or having the strong chemo and waking up with my life in tatters again (it really was horrific) any advice would be much appreciated .  Emily xx",
