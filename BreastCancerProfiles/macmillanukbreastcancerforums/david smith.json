    "Content": "hi my name is dave i dont know any thing about breast cancer but i had leukemia and 7 months of chemo i am now in remission and its all gone , i was given a 30% chance of survival so i took that option. because your young and fit your body can take chemo and recover and thats why they want to throw everything at the cancer. there is a lot of benefits you can get and if you apply for disability benefits remember that at the top of page it says your worst day this year, you dont need anything else to worry about so claim all you can, i am recovering on benfits and i am surviving and paying a 400 pound morgage, iam 51 . macmillan were my best source of info about benefits and my cancer. like your attitude in the reply keep it up and good luck.",
