    "Content": "Hi Irene I was neutropenic with my first dose of chemo and they admitted me to hospital where I had about four days of IV antibiotics, I was then sent home with a weeks worth of oral antibiotics to help prevent an infection setting in. Has your doctor given you antibiotics? I know what you mean about having your chemo delayed,it's hard enough to plan anything during this without that happening too. Good luck for number 6. I had my last one last week and it's a great feeling, I even think my side effects have been less this time, I'm putting it down to the psychological effect of finishing with the chemo :)",
