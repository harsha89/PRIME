      "Content": "Hi ladies from a routine Mammigram, my first one turned 50 in May, I was called for secondary screening. At this appt they told me there was a lump 7mm in right boob. I couldn\u2019t feel it neither could the doctor, although she could see exactly where it was on US screen. Anyway took a biopsy & put in titanium marker, I was told it def wasn\u2019t a cyst & almost def BC. I was given appt there & then for 10 days later, next Monday to meet with consultant & get biopsy results. It\u2019s taken until today for the bruising to be enough that I can have a feel, I can now feel a small lump!! My logical brain tells me this is surely the marker & that it hasn\u2019t grown that significantly in 9 days!!!!  I have been reading lots of your stories & you are a wonderful, kind, strong group of women & in a strange way I\u2019m happy to be part of the club!!!",
