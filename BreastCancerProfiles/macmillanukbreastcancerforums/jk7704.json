      "Content": "Hi Lyndsey When I read your post, I felt like I could've written some of it.  I'm 37, with 2 small children and I know I have invasive ductal cancer, but am awaiting an MRI result, (on Weds), to tell me more!  I was told that they only found cancer on 1 piece of 1 of the biopsies taken and so it is really small, but no more.  Because it was only that one piece they had to say that the pathologist had to look at the possibility of cross contamination, (although this is highly unlikely that the Drs keep telling me)!  I'm also a born worrier and if I don't have something to worry about I then worry about that!!  Now I do have something to worry about.  My emotions are also everywhere, one minute feeling positive, the next my fears overwhelm me and I'm scared stiff.  I too wake up & for about a millisecond forget and then it hits me and then go to bed with all the thoughts in my head, questions that no one can answer at the moment. I'm so glad I've found some places to talk to people who understand, as you really don't understand unless you've been there.  Bug hugs xx",
