      "Content": "Hi everyone, I'm taking everolimus for advanced breast cancer. The therapy caused severe oral mucositis, I got erythemas and ulcers on my oral mucosa,  I felt painful to swallow food. For the management, many people suggested the Caphosol, Nystatin, magic mouthwash and L-Glutamine. Does anyone have experience with these drugs? Are they effective in reducing pain and promoting healing of ulcers? Thx a lot    ",

My dr also recommended  Difflam to me, does it work well for other patients you know? Maybe morphine or fentanyl is good for me to just numb my mouth.",
