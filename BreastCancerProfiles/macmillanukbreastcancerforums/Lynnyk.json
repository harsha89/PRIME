I didn't use the cold cap as I was told that as my hair was already thin on the top it would probably go anyway so didn't fancy the discomfort or the extra time at the chemo clinic to only delay what would probably happen whether or not I used it.  I started to lose my hair at day 18 and about seven days after my second chemo I had lost it all - i didnt shave my head, I picked most of it out but there were some bits that clung fast so I left them - it helped me cope better.  Once chemo was finished and my hair was showing signs of coming back, my daughter shaved all the longer bits off and now it is all growing from the same length :).  ",

      "Content": "Hi - I am on EC and will be on that for all sessions - have had 3, 3 left to go. Have lost all body hair but kept eyebrows/lashes and a small amount of head hair. It isn't such that I could go without a wig or headwear but if it is going to stay as it is, it will be a good start on re-growing if I wasn't to lose any more - my daughter is convinced I have more now than I had a month ago and was just wondering if anyone else had had their hair start to re-grow halfway through when on Epirubicin which is the drug my oncologist told me is the main one that causes the hair loss.",

From other people's experience, could this hair still go or is that likely to be as far as it will go. I wear a sleep cap at night and it's weeks since I found any hair in it. My daughter is convinced I now have more hair than I had a month ago. I didn't shave my head because I really couldn't cope with having it done all in one go and was prepared to lose it all bit by bit but now I am thinking I might not lose it all.",
