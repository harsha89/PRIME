      "Content": "Thanks for your reply Corrine. I think you have highlighted one of my problem areas and that is that you were having 5 or 6 flushes a day and I seem to have nearly that each hour and drip from my forehead, upperlip and back. That's why I thought maybe the Zoladex was adding to the intensity of the symptoms but would have liked a comparison. I guess I do need to contact my BCN to ask questions. Thanks again, Mandy",

      "Content": "Thanks to all you ladies for your replies and sorry I have not been about and responded earlier. I am a week away from zoladex number 9 of 26, plus on Tamoxifen. The changes since I first posted are that the flushes are getting even worse (I wouldn't have believed that possible but they are!). I am dripping, mainly on my forehead, on and off for most of the day. Disturbed sleeps. Very stiff legs/calfs when I have been sitting for a while. Sickness somewhere between 2 and 6 days after jab. To Smokey, one thing I will say is that the tears for me are easing. I still have low moments but no where near as bad as a couple of months ago (from zoladex 3 - 6 being the worst). I have no idea on the itchy spots. I have now asked my BCN what happens after 2 years of zoladex, do the hormones kick back in? The answer was along the lines of... zoladex forces the shut down of the ovaries and the tamoxifen will continue to keep the hormones at bay after the zoladex finishes. Sending lots of hugs and fans to all you lovely glowing ladies! On the positive... at least we know the drugs are working   : )",

      "Content": "Hi to all, Is there anyone here who's follow up treatment has been zoladex & tamoxifen and is willing to share experiences? I am 6 months into treatments and after various problems for the first 3 months everything seems to be settled into what it will be like from now on, and that is... never a good nights sleep, flushes that rise really fast from my feet to my head and cause pressure headaches. Also I am teary or actually cry for about 2 weeks out of the 4 week rota. Amongst many other things.   I really feel as if I would like someone to talk to, to share how I am feeling with and compare journeys with. I have found posts from 2008 but I would like, if at all possible, someone who is near the same timings as me? Thanks, Mandy",

      "Content": "Thanks for your response Diamond. Makes a bit more sense now. I started both the zoladex & tamoxifen on the same day and haven't had a period since. I am also putting on a lot of weight and have joint pains and calf cramps etc. Disturbed sleep and sweats, as I said earlier, are really getting me down. Interesting you say about dry skin as well. I have never used moisturizers but now find I have to. I agree that what is the alternative? At least by having all these symptons we know that the drugs are doing what they are supposed to be doing. I would love to know how you get on with the follow up discussions of having your ovaries removed as I am still a bit confused as to what happens at the end of the 2 years of zoladex. I understand that the hormones could just switch back on. Thanks, Mandy",

      "Content": "Hi Jayne, Yes, I experienced cording and it's not very pleasant is it. Mine went from my arm pit right down to my forearm. I was advised to massage where the \"cord\" was. I also had physio for it and it was a tremendous help. The only way I could describe what it is like is if you remember the childrens sweets, sherbert straws (the long plastic straw with sherbert in)?. Sometimes they got clogged up and the sherbert needed squashing and moving about to get it flowing again. That to me is what the cording was like. I hope you get it sorted soon Jayne.",

      "Content": "Hi Green Giant, Thank you for sharing your story so far. As of yet I have no idea of the treatments I will be having as I am told that I will find out everything I need to know approx. 3 weeks after the operation. I am going on the assumption that I will be having chemo and, like you, have been using my time to find hats. My immediate family are being fantastic supporting me emotionally. Friends, I have had a slightly mixed response from. Some are incredibly supportive and some have distanced themselves. At the end of the day, I value those who have been there for me so far and hope they continue with their support as operation date and treatments draw nearer. My husband and I are being taken out for a meal this evening by one of my dearest friends so I am really looking forward to that!! Good luck for tomorrow, I will be thinking of you x",

      "Content": "I read and follow with interest everyone else's journeys and I am finding them very helpful for when my journey does eventually begin. I now find that I am ready to do my first post here and call upon your experiences to help me some more. I am at the moment in the waiting process. I was diagnosed with BC in my right breast on October 21st at age 44. As there were some concerns over the size of my tummy I had to have abdonimal and pelvic scans. This was done on 4th November. My mother had BC in her early forties (still going strong in her seventies) and her sister also has BC so I have also had genetic testing done. This test was done on November 5th. My chosen operation is to have a mastectomy and I may consider reconstruction at a later date. I have chosen this as I need to see that the cancer has gone and feel that perhaps I wouldn't if I had a reconstruction at the same time. On the good news front, the abdominal and pelvic scans were all clear. The genetics are trying to get my results back prior to my scheduled operation date of 1st December as if I do carry a faulty gene I would opt for a double mastectomy. If this is the case then my operation date would get pushed further back as the current time slot is only sufficient for a single. Pushing the date further back is a big concern as I just want my journey to begin and rid my body of this very unwelcome visitor. I have been told no details apart from the fact that I have breast cancer and this is the part that I am finding hard. I do have pain with my lump and the clinic is aware of this as the examination was very painful and my facial expressions sad it all. The wait from diagnosis to something happening seems so long for me and I am daily experiencing dull stabbing pains and discomfort. This morning I awake to an uncomfortable armpit and all sorts of thoughts are spinning through my head. Is there anyone out there who remembers the aches and pains they had prior to starting surgery or anyone currently at the same stage as me who can say if they are experiencing the same? I am a sufferer of panic attacks and anxiety and obviously this diagnosis has made this worse but I am trying very hard to stay strong. If there is anyone who could share their early experiences I would really appreciate it. Mandy",

      "Content": "Thanks for your reply Debra and I am so glad that everything is going well for you. You are so right about every ache and pain and the thought of it spreading. When I was first diagnosed I found that just being out was a task as my legs would turn to jelly and I would have a panic attack. Much as I have a huge phobia about needles, I can't wait for the next two and a half weeks to pass so I can have my operation and start on the road to recovery. I am just so hoping that the genetics testing is ok because otherwise it will be even longer than the 6 weeks from diagnosis to operation that it is currently standing at. I also feel that now I have made my first post I will feel comfortable about joining in other discussions, where I can, and draw on others strengths and experiences. Thanks again, Mandy",

I agree the pain is a reminder and, I don't know whether it is because I may be sleeping in a different position to try and protect my right side, or if I am just generally tense, but from my neck to my back and down my arm on the right side (my affected side) I am having constant aches and pains. I feel like a right little moaner when all you ladies are already on your journeys and being very brave and managing to cope, so I do appologise, fear of the unknown I guess. Take care Mandy x",
