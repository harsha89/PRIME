      "Content": "Hi Tingk i have had lipofilling at the same time as  I had a mastoplexy on my remaining boob. They also tidied up the sides of my diep incision scars by my hips, apparently the slight overhang I had was referred to as \u2018dog ears\u2019.  For the liposculpting they took fat from my thighs. I was black and blue for a few weeks and had to wear support shorts and support stockings for About 6 weeks following the procedure. I would say the area was sore and uncomfortable but not painful. A walk in the park after diep surgery! at first I thought my boob looked too big, but once it settled in a few weeks it looked great and perfectly matches my diep boob. It was under general anaesthetic, it was day surgery so was allowed home not long after. I was off work for around 6 weeks. i hope this helps Vic x",

      "Content": "Hi Wombat i have had 3 recalls following mammograms after my treatment. Each time it was a phone call to attend the very next day for scans . I didn\u2019t see the consultant or surgeon in any of theses instances.I think if they were worried about any further abnormalities there would be some urgency via a call rather than scheduling an appointment. i must admit I was a nervous wreck each time but it was cysts each time. i also had regular appointments with the surgeon so it could just be a coincidence. I know it\u2019s easy for me to say but try not to worry. Take care Vicbee",
