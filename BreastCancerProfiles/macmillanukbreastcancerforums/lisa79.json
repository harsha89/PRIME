    "Content": "Hiya, I'm always cautious about science and health articles in the press, particularly tabloids and mid-range papers. In my experience (as a scientist), while articles are based on some fact(s) they are written basically to sell papers. Enough of my cynicism! I've tried acupuncture, not for fatigue, but it didn't work for me (in fact, I got a nasty chronic infection and in hindsight should have chosen the therapist more carefully, or not gone at all). I have however heard some reports of it working well for nausea. Not sure about fatigue though. Good luck, whichever way you decide. Lisa",
