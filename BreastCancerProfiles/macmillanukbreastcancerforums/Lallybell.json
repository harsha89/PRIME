      "Content": "Hi Katrina,       I'm sorry you're feeling so low.  It is normal to feel like you do, i certainly did when i had my chemo.  The fourth cycle was worst for me as even though you were over half way through -which was great- you still knew you had another two and if you have a bad time with chemo you knew just what was coming each time. I was so excited (!), when i was on my last chemo, it almost made the side effects bearable knowing that hopefully it was my last.   Radiotherapy is a lot easier, just quite time consuming with getting to the hospital for all the appointments, but compared to chemo, a breeze!!!  Be kind to yourself, you've got such alot going on in your life at the moment, what with yourself and your sister both having cancer, it will take a while to recover from the chemo, radiotherapy etc but just keep knowing that every day you are one day nearer to finishing your treatments and hopefully getting your old life back..  In a way i felt that i sort of grieved for my old life before the cancer struck, some days i would be fine, other days i would be absolutely paranoid about it all, but it does get easier honestly.  Sometimes i would cry in the shower, what with the noise of the water and the radio going, no one could hear me, and i didn't then feel guilty for worrying people even more than i already was.     But sometimes you need your familys/friends support to keep you strong so do lean on them when you need to.   I found that they do like to feel that they are helping you in some way,  as they feel powerless to help you in other ways.   I  used to think of chemo as a long tunnel with light at the end of it and you are so nearly there now.  Keep strong, be good to yourself , and once it has finished, enjoy getting your strength, energy, zest for life back.        Life is precious, that's why we  put ourselves through chemo - and the hell of the side effects - but once it's over it's worth it. Good luck, take care Lisa x          ",

      "Content": "Hi Katrina,    I'm glad you're feeling a bit better, it really is a rollercoaster ride!   I know what you mean about positive thinking, i'm like that too and i somehow thought i would  fine with chemo, mind over matter and all that, and if i was strong enough i'd be ok.    Boy, was i wrong!!!!  I think what i learnt with it, is listen to your body, have a rest or lie down if you feel rough, eat nice things (when you can!), and don't try and push yourself too hard.   Don't beat yourself up over it, as your body will go at it's own speed, so just try and help it in anyway you can.  It's a good idea to go for the spa treatment afterwards, i've been going for reflexology and i must say it's really  lovely and relaxing. With the radiotherapy i worked all the way through (i work 30 hrs a week over 3 days), and it really is fine.   Apart from red skin which you cream twice a day - just like sunbun really -and a little bit of heat it's fine, there was no bad side effects thankfully! Certainly nothing like chemo! With the bad memory, i believe it's called 'chemo brain!!'.   It's really common, i'm not sure why but i can assure you it's normal!!!  I used to try and write down everything important in this little book i had and then check it every day to make sure i had done things/gone for appointments etc!!!!   I believe as well, there is so much going on in your head at this time that it's no wonder you forget things.    If you're like me, you try not to but you become preoccupied with cancer and what it means to you and your family/friends etc that in a way it's no wonder you may be a little absentminded at times!    I think it's great that you're doing the run, really positive and honestly once the chemo is finished you do start to feel alot better and then it becomes like a bad dream somewhere in your past.   Keep strong, all the best Lisa x  ",

      "Content": "Hi Abbey, I haven't been on here for quite a while so i'm sorry if this is probably too late to be of any good to you! I also have MS. i was diagnosed in 2009 with Breast Cancer then the next day i was diagnosed with MS. I have progressive MS so i'm not on any drugs for it but i can say that chemo was ok for me though. The only thing they warned me about was the possibility because of the MS i was more likely to get peripherol neuropathy (pins and needles/numbness) in my hands and feet which i did get but not too bad thankfully. I think you can get this normally anyway but i didn't hear that chemo could affect you neurologically but you maybe on a different chemo that i had (I had FEC-T). I remember being very tired as well but i think that's pretty universal with chemo if i'm honest, but overall i think i was quite lucky with chemo and in one way it helped my MS in as much as my arm which had been quite problematic for a while got quite alot better (strange!), but my MS nurse said that chemo can help MS sometimes as it dampens down the immune system especially if your MS is quite active? (I know they sometimes give it people with MS to try and help them). Good luck with your treatment, i hope it goes as well as it can, take care, Lisa x",

      "Content": "Hi Jo,           Hope you're doing ok today.       I'm not totally the same as you as my periods stopped completely after the first chemo session  i had and didn't return until 10 months later.  Last month they returned -quite heavy but i suppose this is only  normal after all the different drugs etc.     When i told them at the hospital on Friday when i had a chemo check up that they had returned, they started  me on  Zoladex to stop any more coming as my cancer was heavily Oestrogen driven . (I'm not sure i spelt that right!) So i imagine that once your body has had a chance to recover they should be back to normal hopefully.   I've heard that everyone is different with the length of time  so maybe it may just be a bit longer but i'm sure it'll be fine soon.     Good luck with everything,     Lisa ",
