      "Content": "on phone to old friend. She has been good during this, sending flowers etc. but I am still upset about something she said. So, I ( like all of us) have been and are going through hell, in fact most people's worst nightmare ( interesting, was listening to 5Live yesterday and they had a programme about cancer and said cancer is people's No 1 fear). Anyway, as I have mentioned before, I was very fit ( ran 10 k- 2-3  times a week) not overweight, not smoker etc etc - basically ticked all the non cancer boxes. Then get hit with this s*it from a great height in January.  so, my mate says \"you know, even although I know what's happened to you, I still feel invincible- like this only happens to other people. You probably felt like that\". Er no. I didn't. I watched a close friend die of this aged 29 so that is why i got my backside to the doctors. I came off the phone feeling shocked, upset and again, WHY ME?????? I knew this could happen, was alert and vigilant ( constantly checking under armpit for nodes etc) and I still get it. Just finished active treatment. Waiting on MRI's to assess pain in hip and groin. This  whole cancer thing will never I guess. ",

      "Content": "no doubt others with much more knowledge than me  will be along soon, but I'll chuck in my tuppenceworth. Once the doctors have the biopsy and scan results back ( ie bloods, CT, bone etc) , these in conjunction with the finding from your mammo will give you your clinical diagnosis. What this means is that they will stage you out of 4 according to the results from the scans and biopsy. To be fair to the docs, they don't really have the whole picture until they have operated on you and removed the tissue and examined this under the microscope. The results of your op will be contained in your pathology report. Your consultant will meet with you  a week or so after the op to discuss the contents of the pat report. This will disclose size, type and grade of cancer as well as number of lymph nodes affected, and if there has been any invasion via the blood stream ( vascular invasion).  So, for example, when I pitched up at the clinic i got told on that day that they thought I had cancer ( MASSIVE shock). from the ultrasound and mammos they thought there were two tumors, on 17mm and one 15 mm, with DCIS and no nodes. Roll on a few weeks  after I had a mastectomy and lo and behold I had 3 tumors one 31mm, on 19mm and on 14 with 1 out of the 3 nodes they took out testing positive. I then had to go back for a full node clearance and i await the results of these. So, if they think nodes are involved then they will remove these along with the lump to avoid having to do two separate ops. If they don;t think any are involved they will take a sample ( called sentinal nodes) and if any of these are positive then you are back in for another op. I guess what I am trying to say is that the scans are not definitive. The nodes might just be enlarged but there has been no spread. I've seen ladies on here whose scans showed large nodes but no spread, but then there is cased like mine where the scans were totally clear ( i asked the radiologist to show me as I was so paranoid that first day) yet there has been spread. HAve they told you what size they think your tumor is?   To be honest, it does get better. Look at some of my previous postings and you will get a flavour of the state I was in. I just want these results on Wed to tell me how many nodes are involved so i can get this dam thing sorted and on with my life. I am 37 by the way with a 2year old, so don;t think you are alone age wise- there are quite a few of us. Have a look at the Breast Cancer care website too. THat provides alot of info. Ask your breast care nurse as well. Mine has been excellent and an immense support. This is truly an awful time for you , but you need to remember you are never alone in this. x x",

There you go, I had it in my head that my tumor had grown through to my chest wall and would show up on the xray, or they would say there are a couple of areas they need to investigate.   so, MRI, bone and liver scans on thursday. I have to say. the NHS in scotland have been superb.              ",

Not only am i really young- 37 and lost an entire boob, the cancer is much more than initally thought. I can;t take much more. i really can;t x",

Society has to do everything it can to eradicate it. Breast cancer can be and must be stamped out. mothers are the glue that keep families together . Multiply that across the uk and there is a huge problem for the nation's wellbeing.  ( not to say sending wee boy's out to nursery with odd socks- as hubby did the other day!).  BC should become either curable or a chronic disease. not a death sentence. and i am sorry, it is bullshit that screening is only for over 50's and  pain is not a sign of BC. Christ, I am 37, had no lumps, pain ( which I thought was menstrual)  that came and went and then disappeared entirely  for weeks on end. it was only my hypochondria and recurring dreams about impending ill health  ( volcanos with lava!) that made me go to gp. he didn't feel anything. consultant didn't feel anything.   do 10k runs every week.! BC does affect loads of under 50's and  the reason the prognosis for under 50's/ 40's is so poor is because of  the misconception that it won't affect them ; so by the time they present at clinic their disease is too advanced to treat. ",

I remember he specifically said that.   even the consultant at that breast clinic didn;t feel anything and said- \"all normal breast tissue\"( but in line with protocols up here at this point they still need to refer you for a mammo at that stage- that's when it all unravelled.    i think my sixth sense kicked in.

I always wondered how people with cancer coped, but dismissed it from my mind as too painful to consider: now I am in that position.   i'm thinking of all the baby clothes i washed and ironed and put up the loft and all the baby toys we kept  for when we had another. last night i had one of those silent scream dreams- you know the ones where you are shouting out for help at the top of your voice, but all that comes out is a squeek.   i've not got as far as looking at nutrition etc. i've just been eating toast and drinking tea.   christ, when my wee boy was born he was seriuosly ill and was in neo natal intensive care - i thought i had had my shit, and now this.    i really am not coping at all and can't shake the feeling of doom off, or relax at at all. i cant watch telly or even the news.    you did really well at your wee girl's b'day party. that would've been so painful and you must feel robbed that you couldn't just enjoy the day without this hanging over you. You look at other mums and think why me.? why this? this is not happening. my heart is breaking every time i look at my wee boty. i was in his room last night watching him sleep and thinking about the day he was born and how  he came through an awful time and then we were so happy. the singing in the house has stopped. the dancing  in the house has stopped. the laughter has stopped. the music has stopped.   i never took my health for granted. was always so grateful when i was out running that i could do just that, and see and smell.   for the first time in my life i see nowhere to turn.   x  ",

I am still shit scared and no matter what anyone says i am still shaking. Mentioned pain in my back to the doc today and he pressed it and said it was muscular.    The thing that is really putting the shitters up me is that they say the staging can changed once they\\ve done the mx. Apparently my affected area is 10 X 8 and that this 3d ( not 2d). he said if they take the breast off they may find alot more and in nodes and put me to stage 3 which made me nearly faint ( ie it has become one BIG lump. i  collapsed into my hands and hunched up in the seat at this point). The breast nurse then said that becuase it is multi focal ( which they raved on about ) and lobular ( i sprinkeld about like sugar)  then this was unlikely- so whay did they tell me????? I then pressed him to establish how many changes to initial stagin they make a year and they said 1-2 which i thought was pretty good.   Breast nurse called this afternoon to say my bloods were ok ( they were testing for platelets and liver function). Gor chest x ray and I am shit scared about results of that. THey say ultrasound showd clear nodes and 10% chance of having gone in ,  but that is not full story unitl I get mx. I am physically shaking as i am typing. have taken diazeapm and that doesn't seem to be working. Bottom line is I have cancer in my body and I am absolutely not coping.        ",

I was told the liver and all other abdominal stuff look  normal. I was just waiting for that beep beep of them measuring stuff as happened in my ultrasound but that didn't happen.   bone scan is the worst thing ever- the waiting after you've had the dye injested etc is horrific.  The bone bod person was so lovely. I was in complete tears having the scan done. Both the breast care nurse and bone bod warned me in advance that they may need to take extra xrays  if they need to investigate  specific areas further not  because  of \"C\" but just but maybe because of degenerative condition / wear and tear  etc ( but you know the subtext is they are looking for \"c\". The bone care bod  then said when the scan was nearly done that she thought that unlikely because  it looks quite normal. So, I was chucked out , asked to wait in my gown in case they needed further  xrays etc. Then, they appear and say we don't need anything more - you are free to go. I'm hoping that is a good sign  because what I am beginning to learn is that any whiff of a suspicious area, they haul you back right away and investigate it- as per  the initial mammo / ultrasound etc.   I' m now just  beginning to see a glimmer of light in the dark hole that I am in that this might just have be caught in the nic of time.    x          ",

Like you I was told i had small invasive areas ( 1.7 cm and 1.5 cm ) and no node involvement. I asked how often this can change from stage 1 to 2 and they said not very often. After my mx in feb, turns out I had three tumours, the largest being 3.1cm. and one node +ve, I was devastated. Had to have a further op to take out other nodes.   So, the results can change from initial scans. The docs just can't guarantee what is there until they check and remove the tissue. The point is  that whatever happens they will gear the treatment to suit your diagnosis. That dreadful day  of my initial diagnosis, they said to me i might not need chemo. Turns out i needed the works. In a weird way now, I am glad I am getting chemo because there is always the chance cells could get out- at least this systemic treatment is giving me a fighting chance of killing any floating about.  This is the worse time for you. it is horrendous- I've been there but once you get your results you will feel a bit better x ",

I like you started to go into a meltdown. i asked the ivf guy if he thought it was cancer and he said no. I also got my gp to find out if we needed to do anything. I got a letter the other day saying it was a haemoragic (sp?) cyst. Cysts are really common and usually benign. great the mri picked it up though- shows you it picks up anything so if the rest of it is clear then that is great news x ",

      "Content": "hi Kelly. I am sorry you find yourself here. I am also sorry to hear the news about your Dad. Life really does deal terrible blows.    I was diagnosed in January this year aged 37. I have a wee boy who then was two and just turned three 3 a couple of weeks ago. All your feelings are normal- we have all been there. You find yourself in what I think is the worse place: knowing you have cancer but not sure where, what type, what treatments you'll need etc. I was absolutely devastated. There is a thread on this site which i started in january headed something like \"aged 37 shock at  breast clinic yesterday..\" you'll see from that the turmoil i was in, but more importantly the help i received from people on here . Cancer just isn't supposed to happen to you, is it? not at this aged anyway. Six months on I still catch myself thinking is this really happening? Anyway, since january I have been through a mastectomy, then node clearance op and I am now on chemo. I never thought for a minute this would happen to me. The point is you will get through whatever they throw at you. You might not need chemo, which would be great. Even if you do, you will cope. My boy has kept me going; yes even when I wonder if I will see him grow up. You will not feel like this now, but cancer does give you a new appreciation for life. We wanted another baby this year, but that is unlikely to happen because of the treatments I am getting. However, I am so grateful ( more than I was even) that I have a beautiful healthy boy who is thriving. you are just starting out and don't know where you are going yet. Things will become clearer when you find out more about your diagnosis and treatment plans. Have a look at my thread and see how much I have come on. You must believe me. I really wish you all the very best and hope that your Dad is as comfortable as can be. Keep posting all your worries here, x ",

To be honest I don't know how on earth you are managing to cope with work and looking after your wee girl. I am totally knackered and i am not joking, sleep most of the time. I've only had 2 chemos so not sure if this is a cumulative thing or not. Think it is more the fact of it being put back as means finishing line is further away. That said, it is surprising how quick it goes- probably 'cos i am sleeping all the time. Looking forward to that glass of wine with you and lulu when we are through this!!!! x ",

Bumped into a bloke i  used to know from exercise classes  and he couldn't believe it was me in  a scarf. Poor bloke was totally shocked. Makes you realise just what an enormous thing we are all going through. anyway, feel much better from my walk. Saw a few neds and worried about them puling my scarf off but it went ok x ",
