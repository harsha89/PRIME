    "Content": "Firstly hi to all you lovely ladies, I am new here. I feelafraud because I have only just had a mamogram two weeks ago. I was waiting for the letter to say all clear. But I got a letter two days ago to say that \"screening images have been looked at and, before we can give you a final result, you need to attend the assessment centre\". I am in a right state and have all sorts of thoughts going through my head, some morbid. Just wanted to know if anyone else in same boat? Sorry I know that you ladies are more knowledgable than me.",
