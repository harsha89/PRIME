      "Content": "Hi everyone, Last week I got the bad news that I have breast cancer. I am 32 years old and I feel completely lost and so ignorant about this disease. I don't know what to expect , how long is going to take,if I have done something wrong or if they have made a mistake with the diagnosis. i feel overwhelmed awaiting for my MRI this Friday. They havent said too much about it. just that I might be on stage 2. My lump is about 3cm. I want to stay positive but I am so anxious about what is coming. I can't even touch my breast because I feel scared. Should I get more info or just wait until the doctors say something else? I am so lost. Thanks!x",

I don't know how long tho,one month , 3 months uff .I just hope to be able to carry on with my life as normal as possible in the meantime. I will have lots of questions for sure. I hope I won't bombard you too much.xx",

      "Content": "Thanks to all for being so supportive in here. I was a bit hesitant to join in at the beginning but I thought this was the best to deal with my situation and seeing such a strong people here makes everything a bit more bearable.Â  I am a teacher too but I would like to carry on with work but I will obviously follow doctor's advice if that is not a good idea with my treatment. Clare all the best for tomorrow.I'll keep you in my thoughts. dreamthief . Thansk for the link. I really need something like this now. Little susie. I think holidays will help so I can see my family too. I don't have family here and one feels better and comforted being around them. Jan2bad-> I am going to kick the arse of this one too. Akker as you said I don't want to worry family as they live far away. they know me well and they believe I will stay strong. Lindsey-> I think YBCN sounds a good idea. I will def see you there. Big hugs to everyone!xx",
