      "Content": "Hiya Minnie Don't you worry - it's natural to be scared of the unknown, it's human nature. I had my 4th cycle of FEC-T yesterday and I could tell you that I have sailed through it so far but you know that wouldn't be true - you will have good days and bad days so just go with the flow. Listen to your body and do what it tells you. Take your meds and just take it one step at a time You can be as strong as you do or do not wish to be but just remember that by fighting this you are already proving what a strong and powerful soul you are - your family and loved ones don't need any more evidence than that. One day at a time and one step at a time Big hugs OAX PS if screaming helps you go for it",
