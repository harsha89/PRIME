      "Content": "Hi I had my surgery on 10 sept. I had a wide local excision and lymph node clearance. I'm not sure how many they took? Just wondering if anyone else has had really bad swelling in their armpit. I'm not able to out my arm down properly now as the swelling is about the size of a tennis ball. I had the drains removed 6 days ago. My surgeon said to expect swelling but not sure how much is normal. Sorry to sound stupid!! (I'm 44 years old not sure if this makes any difference). I'm not due back to see my surgeon for another week",

      "Content": "Thank you guys just wasn't sure if I needed to go to the hospital and get it checked. I probably sound paranoid but I've been back to hospital 3 times already with blocked drain ,de vac drain and a high temp. I don't get my margin results until Monday 29th as they cancelled my appointment this week. Do you guys feel any different. I don't know how I'm meant to feel. Apart from feeling very tired and sore I don't feel any different.",
