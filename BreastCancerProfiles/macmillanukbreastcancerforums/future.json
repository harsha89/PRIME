      "Content": "Hello Thanks to everyone on here, it's so helpful to share and compare experiences because no two of us will be exactly the same. Barfy I can totally relate. I just had my annual check and mammograms after ending treatment (two ops, chem and rad) three years ago, which is when I started on Letrozole (I was just post menopausal at diagnosis). I couldn't bear it so switched to Tamoxifen which was worse. Also it made me socially very unconfident - extreme moments at work when side effects overwhelmed me and embarrassingly was hugely obvious - anyone like the just-taken-a-shower-in-all-my-clothes look? Anyway a took a break and then decided to try anastrazole which was my last option, I didn't want to look back and think if only I'd tried .... I feel exactly the same way as you. I raised the issue with my consultant who said two more years and you can stop but felt it was a conversation I should really have with oncology. Which I will (again). It seems there's a lot of conflicting advice out there but at the end of the day I totally agree it has to be a judgement call made by you and you alone and the best you can do is make an informed decision based on the facts as we know them and how you feel about your quality of life. My worst problem is nausea and every day when I wake up I have to say to myself it will get better in two hours. Which it does. But the 90 year old creeping around thing - drives me mad! Thank you for sharing, it's good not to feel you're the only one/imagining it. Be good to yourself. Lots of love.",

      "Content": "Thanks so much everyone for their thoughts here. I started out on Letrozole, then tried Tamoxifen (both equally grim) then finally Anastrozole. I can totally relate to comments about feeling old and out of sorts all the time (I am 57). I will definitely be insisting on switching to Arimidex in the hope it will reduce side effects. Thank you again everyone as without this information I would be none the wiser.",

      "Content": "Hello, I can absolutely relate to your situation. My mother died of breast cancer when she was 58. I was diagnosed two years ago at the age of 54. For me, initially, the emotional turmoil was almost entirely about my memories of her treatment. It took me a while to understand that my experience would be very different. Took me a long time, in fact. I think it's difficult that your memory of your primary role model stops at the age we are now. I still sometimes peer into the future but not very often. I have found counselling to be enormously helpful and therapeutic and I wouldn't hesitate to suggest this - I went to my local Macmillan centre where everyone is fabulous, kind, gentle and encouraging - just like everyone I've ever had contact with at Macmillan in fact. It means that you focus on you and your needs and you work out the best way to deal with the situation according to you as a unique individual. These days (just had second year review) I try not to look into the future at all, not consciously anyway. It kind of goes against my nature, but on the other hand it makes it easier to stay in the here and now. Hope that doesn't sound like a load of gibberish and that today is a good one. xx",

      "Content": "Hello The test is a simple blood test and in my case it took about three weeks to get the results. My mother was diagnosed with breast cancer at 50 and died eight years later. I was diagnosed at 54 (I am now 57). My aunt died from advanced ovarian cancer and my cousin, her daughter, was also diagnosed with breast cancer in her mid 40s, about a  year before me. I had two surgeries followed by chemotherapy and rt. Both  my cousin and I were offered genetic testing (we don't live near each other so were treated separately) and both decided to do it. Of course it's a very personal decision but I am so glad I had it done. In my view knowledge is power, and as you say I think if the results can help to inform your decisions about treatment, this can only be a good thing. Both of us received negative results which I found surprising; I was absolutely convinced it would be positive. So sometimes your expectations can be confounded. I'm sorry I don't  know much about the procedure going forward if the tests are positive but I am sure you will get answers to any questions you ask if and when you have the blood test done. I salute your courage, send my love and hope that your treatment continues successfully.",

Since posting my original message I decided to come off tamoxifen completely for a while. i had my second annual check-up a few weeks ago and am now going back to oncology next week to talk about whether I have any other options to tamoxifen.

I can't work out whether this is it, and that I will just have to tolerate all the terrible-quality-of-life stuff that it seems to me tamoxifen is causing, or whether there will be another alternative suggested.
