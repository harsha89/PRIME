      "Content": "I was the same after wle told it was dcis so just radiotherapy and only tiny amount of er receptors and grade three but lymph nodes clear.went into oncol who said I needed chemo and tamoxifen. Ok I thought if its what I need but as usual studied everything on dcis-chemo not recommended. Got upset on rough days following chemo wanting to stop so phoned bc nurse she told me non invasive. Then geneticist phoned about blood tests for triple negative! Finally spoke to oncologist yesterday before chemo. Inside the tumour were invasive cells found and as its grade three need chemo. My er receptors are three so its borderline going to try tamoxifen. Feel better now I'm glad I spoke to her. I think as well because I'm a nurse I was being fobbed off but the oncol was great. Sorry for writing a book!",

I had a reducing dose of steroids with last one and only had bone pain for twenty mins ( time for paracetamol and ibuprofen to work) I took nystatin and chlorhexidine mouthwash had lovely white tongue. That and the severe stomach cramps are the ones I'm really worried about getting again. I'm waiting for my bcn phoning back, I wonder if I could get something for those. The last time I was getting chemo when I was telling the nurse all the side effects I'd had she commented that I'd had a hard time on chemo. Myself and my mother in law were quite shocked everyone including myself all said I'd sailed thru only bad for about a week each cycle. (Until tax then two weeks) started me wondering if I've been a bit precious, but they ask about se and I tell them!",

I'm just so confused I know it is my decision and no one can make it for me but even though I'm not getting it I don't feel any happier. at the beginning of treatment i was told the cancer was gone but because I was only 39 and grade 3 chemo was gold standard treatment, now I believe that it is going to come back in a few years time and keep coming back. but every time I think I should just have it I remember how terrible I felt. I also feel I'm being stupid and ungrateful because mine is treatable. Sorry for the length of this I am just so muddled up. I already had the reduced dose last time because I got peripheral neuropathy in mmy hands.",
