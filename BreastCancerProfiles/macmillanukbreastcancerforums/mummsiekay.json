I have only recently finished my radiation of my breast. The The rash started between my breast and then seem to follow underneath the breast And up into the armpit.  Sorry it probably is a bit late anyway just thought maybe you could tell me what happened.

      "Content": "Hi there welcome understand how you feel completely I was diagnosed in April I hated the whole thing waiting for the results and even though I have only just been for my first radiotherapy session today I still can\u2019t believe I actually have cancer. My advice would be  take somebody with you for the result it\u2019s an extra pair of ears and if not ask them if they mind if you take the conversation on your phone you will forget half of it I promise you. Next take it one step at a time it gets easier as the time goes on and you will just cope with a laugh with cry with it let it be . I never like to say good luck love and trust is what you need and you will get through it.  I truly believe that feeling positive is The best way to get through it. Love and light . Kas. Xx",
