      "Content": "Hi Chrissi, I had my first FEC last Tuesday but didn't have the cold cap. Had major dramas trying to find a vein as they had all gone awol lol (wonder why?) treatment actually took less time than it did to find a vein! Its 6 days now since my first treatment and I am just starting to feel the effects. Yesterday was a bad day I was really tired and very emotional, but I drank lots of chocolate milk that made me feel tons better. I'm suffering from quite a bit of indigestion as well, seems to be every time I eat or drink and within a few minutes. Got that really horrible furry feeling in my mouth as well, feels really strange. Don't know what to suggest for the indigestion, Gaviscon is a good bet, crystalised ginger is also good to settle the stomach if you like ginger. My indigestion is not too bad so I'll put up with it for the time being. Seeing as our treatments are only 2 days apart I'd like to run alongside you so we can compare notes, would that be okay? Love and hugs Josie (Delilah)",

I'm 52 post-menopausal, 3 nodes positive and 2.5cm lump, similar to you but not so many nodes affected so I'm not sure age is the reason. It'll be interesting to see what other ladies have to say, I'll certainly ask the nurses tomorrow. I read about you fainting in the bath, feeling like a broken spider, poor you, it must have been really frightening? If you hurt yourself does it take longer for the body to repair whilst you're on chemo? Take care x",

Its all a bit scary all this stuff they put into you and the medical staff all seem to think that you're up for it without too much fuss, just saying it will be better for you in the long run! Are you having a PICC? I'll let you know how I get on. My next treatment is 30th March. I've had the luxury of not having to go to work. They have signed me off on long term sick leave until I am better. They are also being absolutely brilliant and paying me full pay, what an employer eh? So far I have been off since last October, so we're coming up 6 months now. Not sure I want to go back to work after this, getting quite use to being at home!. Are you having Filgrastin injections to up my blood count. I started them last Saturday, will be for 5 days, which will then take me up to day 10 after the treatment. Are you having these as well? I don't think I've heard anyone else mention them. Had a rough day Sunday, but much better now. Always better when the sun shines anyway!",

      "Content": "Hi Chrissi and everyone, Hows the first week been for you? Just thought I would let you  know how this week has been for me. After my treatment on the 9th I was okay for a few days but then started to feel bad. By day 6 on the Sunday I was really depressed and felt awful. Couldn't put it down to anything in particular, just everything in general. I think that the reality of the chemo and everything else suddenly caught up with me and I felt like I couldn't handle it. I had a district nurse come out to give me my injection and she said it was usual to feel like this, a lot of things going on etc. Told me not to be on my own and to try and eat. The thought of food was the furthest from my mind. I had no sense of tatse and my mouth had that funny furry spongy feeling. However I did manage to eat a small amount. By contrast when I woke up on Monday I felt really good and almost back to 'normal'. I was a little apprehensive by Wednesday as this would be the last of my 5 injections to boost my blood count and I thought I might slide back again, but since then as the week has gone I have got better and better and am now almost feeling my old self. Even had a 5 mile walk on Thurssday! I had to go to the hospital on Tuesday to have a PICC line put in, but this was unsuccessful as I have very small veins and the sister kept hitting a nerve. Not a pleasant experience I can tell you. They have now decided that a hickman line is the next option and I am waiting for an apppointment to have this put in. Hopefully it will be next week just before treatment number 2. I don't know whether they will be able to use the line straight away as I think it needs to heal a bit first. In the meantime I am going to do my upmost to try and get my veins up by Tuesday. Will do some exercise in the morning, have a hottish shower and drink lots of fluids so that hopefully there won't be a repeat of the first treatment. I think my hair is just starting to fall out. I've noticed it more on the hair 'down there' maybe because its darker than the hair on my head. But there are definately more hairs in the bath now. Hats and scarves are at the ready! I've just read through your reply to Andrea and have come to the conclusion that they must use the same terminology throughout the UK. I was also told that the chemo/radiotherapy was 'belt and braces' and a 'mopping up' job. I suppose its reassuring in a way that they all use the same language? After your FEC will you be on Docetaxel? Been reading about other experiences and can't say I'm really looking forward to it! Still everyone is different. Stay positive Josie xx",

      "Content": "Hi Chrissi, My hair has just started to fall out. Like you I have fine hair, so it will only be a short time before it becomes noticable. I had my hair cut short last week in anticipation of the hair loss so hopefully it won't be too much of a shock for me. I think maybe by the end of this week I might just have it shaved off, at least that way its gone and I won't have the stress of losing it slowly. Let me know how the cold cap goes, I hope it saves most of your hair. I did read that there may still be some loss, but not as much. I'm waiting for my wig to arrive, although not sure if I will wear it. The 'wig lady' did say that its always good to have the wig cos there will be days when you feel like c**p but want to look normal and at least by putting the wig on you may outwardly look normal. When I tried the wigs on last week I did think they felt very warm, a bit like wearing a woolley hat. With the summer coming up maybe I'll just go au natural or wear a scarf/baseball cap. Thats a good idea about Ebay, I'll certainly remember that once my hair starts growing back! Josie xx",

      "Content": "Hi Hat and all you lovely ladies, I've been reading everyones messages this week but haven't had much to say myself as have been feeling really quite well and feeling a bit of a fraud! The sunshine has certainly helped this and I've been out and about walking my little legs off trying to get some exercise!. I've had the odd few little niggles, waking early, sore mouth,spots, watery eyes (don't know what thats all about!) I'm also losing my hair big time now, so I'm going to go for it tomorrow and shave it off, I hope I find it liberating! Hat, I'm not on my own, I have a partner who is being really wonderful and supportive. I am naturally a strong character and it is hard for me to admit when I am feeling down. Because of this he does not know when I need support, but he seems to have developed some 6th sense and now knows when to give me a cuddle or leave me alone. I find that during the day when he calls to see if I am okay, even if I am not, I will say I'm fine and that way I kind of convince myself that I am and it helps me to carry on. I do try not to hold anything back from him though, I want him to be as much involved in what I am going through as possible. The appointment for the Hickman line never came through this week, so it looks as though we will be playing hunt the vein again on Tuesday. In a way I'm glad, the last experience when they tried to get a PICC line in was not pleasant. Any ladies out there that have had a Hickman line put in? I would welcome your experiences. Anyone got any ideas how I can bring my veins up so I don't have this problem? Chrissi, I'll keep you posted how my next treatment goes. Glad you're not losing your hair yet, hope you can keep hold of it. Might get some temporary tattoos for my head, that way it could look a bit more dressed when naked!! Best wishes to everyone, keep reading and sharing, we can all do this together, be strong. Josie X",

      "Content": "Hi Paula, Sorry to hear you were so ill after your first treatment I hope your stomach has settled down a bit now? Maybe they will have to change your dosage if you had such a bad reaction? The thought of all this treatment is scary enough without having a bad reaction and then ending up in hospital. I'm sure your next one will be better. I had my first treatment of FEC on 9th March, had the same problem as you because they couldn't find a vein and I had to sit with my arm in a bowl of water. They gave me lots of tea as well and were very patient. I've now decided to have a PICC line put in later on today to save me from becoming a human sieve, so I'll let you know how this goes in case you want to do the same. The first couple of days after treatment I found that I couldn't taste much anyway, so I gave myself little treats like Mars milk and soleri ice lollies until my tastebuds recovered. My district nurse has suggested that I get meal supplements from my GP for those days when you need an extra boost. You can get these on prescription so maybe they will be worth a try? They do all different types, milky drinks, mousse, soups etc so a bit of variety. Stay positive x Josie (Delilah)",

      "Content": "Hi Fiona, I agree with you about the nurses. I know they can only do so much but reading about all 'our ladies' experiences here at least gives us a better picture of what might happen. I'm certainly going to be interested in how Taxotere goes for you. I am coming up to treatment number 2 of 3 FEC and then I will be onto 3 Taxotere so I want to be well armed and aware going into it. I really hope its not too bad for you. I had a right mastectomy in January and like you was concerned about the scar. Although I had more tissue removed, the healing process is still the same and I was told that the scar would take months to settle down. I had quite a bit of fluid build up which had to be drained off, nothing painful just a bit uncomfortable, felt like I had a water bed in my chest! I'm using Bio Oil as well twice a day, it does help. Try to get some of the oil onto your scar, I felt the same about mine, making me feel sick at the thought, but once I had touched it, it was okay. I think it does also help you to come to terms with what has been done to your body, it was a major operation and your body has been violated (strong word I know but fitting I think?). You're coping really well and once you accept your scar you can move on to be stronger for the next pile of c**p they throw at you! Its a lovely sunny day today, hope its sunny where you are?

      "Content": "Hi mummykif, If you check out m&s online they have some other bras that might be suitable. I've had a mastectomy also and thought that I would not be able to wear a wired bra again because of the scar. I've found that although I need to get a more fuller fitted bra, I can still wear wires. So don't rule them out entirely. I haven't been told that its not suitable to wear them, so maybe that will help to widen your search? If you've got a decent bra shop near you, get some help from them. I'm sure they'll be only to glad to help. The bc nurses also gave me some brochures, Anita, Eloise and Amoena. Check them out online, they do have some good styles. The only thing that angers me slightly is the prices. They are not cheap and I feel like I'm having to pay more for my mastectomy, just for a pocket in a bra, than your average woman.  Happy hunting Josiexx",
