      "Content": "Ladies -Happy Christmas to you all.  I had my 11th session out of 12 of weekly Paxitaxol yesterday & I have been using the cold cap with really good success until today when I had my weekly hair wash & a large amount of hair came out when I combed it - do you think it's an indication that it will fall out at this late stage or is this just a blip - would be so upset for it all to fall out with only one more session to go. (After persevering with the cold cap) How long after finishing chemo will it still continue to fall out do you think? Also has anyone had any experience with using FAST or Nioxel or Keratase shampoo & a Revitalash eye lash growth serum ??? ",

      "Content": "Hi Funda sorry to hear of your diagnosis - it takes a while to sink in doesn't it. i can't comment on the first 2 options you were given but I am weekly Paxiltaxol (Taxol) I am hopefully having my 9th session on Thursday. I was only given this option. To be honest compared to some of the lovely ladies on this site I have been very lucky - I have had a couple of side effect - mainly an upset tummy - but this has not happened each week - I have had no sickness and I was told that that is a real benefit of having Paxiltaxol. I have also been doing the cold cap & again a benefit of Paxitaxol is that many ladies who do cold cap have a good chance of keeping some hair - mine is a bit thinner but if you didn't know me you wouldn't notice. (Hoping that it will stay for the last few sessions).  I am by no means an expert but in my experience having the weekly sessions has been so much better than I could have hoped for - I have even managed to keep going to the gym (not everyday !!!!). I would advise you to ask about a PICC line if you go for weekly as having bloods & chemo each week I think I would be rather like a pin cushion by now.  Hope this helps and good luck with which ever treatment you decide on.

      "Content": "Hi there I have all also started running again after my surgery, chemo etc and I also find my boob does get a bit sore - I have tried both front & back fastening high impact sports bras (I'm don't have big boobs either - even smaller now following surgery) and to be honest neither is better than the other. I have also tried to wear the sports bra and then a gym type top so basically you have to bras - if that makes sense. I am trying to build my distance up but only managing to run 5 km in about 36 minutes but hopefully I will get quicker over the next few months.  Good luck with your running and just keep in your mind the health benefits from this can only be good for us.

I am terrified & the thought of losing my hair is worrying me ( I am going to give cold cap a go).  Is this normal reactions from family !!! ",

      "Content": "Hi - I have been using the cold cap & have done 11sessions out of 12 weekly Paxiltaxol (due to have my final session on New Years Eve) my hair has been ok throughout all be it has got thinner with each week - on my last session quite a bit came out but not enough to make any bald patches - my thoughts on it if doing the cold cap meant that I kept my hair for an extra few weeks then that was worth it. I am not as brave as some ladies on here and go bald with pride. I think if you can bear it stick with it until you decide it's not worth it or no longer working.  As for wearing the cold cap I fashioned a band using a cotton belt from a nightshirt & and I put it over my ears & my forehead in a bandana type style and this keeps the cold off your skin. I also put a towel/scarf at the back of my head where the tube joins the cap so again it's off your skin. My chemo unit also gives us heated wheat bags & snuggled under blankets with my Uggs on I have gotten through it. I only wash my hair once a week (the day after my chemo) & just have an Alice band to keep it out of my face etc I only try to touch it if I have to and if I do comb it I use a really wide toothed comb. I hope it all works out for you and best wishes for your next session. Xx ",

If you do end up having chemo ( and I Keep my fingers crossed you don't) you won't feel like wine so enjoy while you can.  If you keep positive & keep your life as normal as you can you will get through the this with no issues.  Good luck with your results xx",
