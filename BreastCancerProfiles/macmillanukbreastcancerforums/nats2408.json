    "Content": "Hi All..I had my 1st FEC chemo 13 days ago, was diagnosed 3 weeks ago (3 1/2 weeks before our wedding which is on Saturday!!) so grateful that the NHS have moved so quickly and also planned my next chemo around our mini-moon to Paris.  I wore the cold cap but will NOT be doing that again, it was the worst part for me.  I have bought a wig and head-scarves so I am prepared, just wondered if anyone else had the terrible headachesI have had on and off for the past 5 days?  Is this a side effect to the chemo that nobody told me about?  Or something to do with the inevitable hairloss?  I have felt pretty ok for the past week and better everyday but am aware it will get worse as time goes on, even more so when the Taxotere starts (just in time for Xmas) timing is impeccable but then again, when is a good time?? Never.  Am trying to stay positive as I'm told that helps butJEEZ it is hard some days.... Much Love to you all xx",
