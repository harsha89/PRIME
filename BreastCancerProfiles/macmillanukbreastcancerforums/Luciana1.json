      "Content": "Carolyn I hope to make this my last post on this particular element of the campaign, but just a few random points 1 Taylor was here when the controversy broke, yet he still hasn't managed to come up with a less offensive campaign. You have to ask 'why'. I see in the press that Recipe won the creative for the campaign (although it's not on their show reel).. My guess is that it was intended to last for X years, and much of the cost has been  amortised over that period (can't tell from the accounts) so, even if he wanted to (and Macmillan strikes me as being the sort of out fit now that would rather brazen things out - just look at the horrid photo they've now put on the site despite the comments here) he doesn't have the budget for a new creative strategy. 2 The current CEO was, presumably, largely responsible for selling the campaign to her predecessor and for approving it this year. No one likes to see their pet project binned. 3 In my experience, agencies love charity clients as they regard them as a soft touch and get away with things they wouldn't even try on commercial clients with similar budgets. Of course charities should make use of professional services but the number Macmillan uses, and the range across which they use them, surprises me.  I would like to think that Macmillan will listen to what's being said, but I see no sign of it. Not that it will make much difference, but I'm giving them nothing while this campaign is running.",

      "Content": "Carolyn I quite agree with you - other than about Sorrell : nothing to do with him as far as I can tell so it might be safer to delete your reference to him just in case !  I often think there are more people making money from people with cancer than there are people with cancer. The logic of so much charity advertising and marketing seems to me to be we must have an expensive advertising campaign so we can raise money to...er..er..afford an expensive advertising campaign to raise money so that we can ...er...er...afford an expensive advertising campaign....repeat ad infinitum. The Macmillan published summary accounts are rather coy about the breakdown of advertising and promotional expenditure but the summary figures seem to me to show a 'cost of sale' in proportion to income that would be unacceptable in any sector I've ever worked in.",

      "Content": "Rebecca I've just had a look at some of those early posts of which I was unaware - talk about déjà vu! If anything, the posts - some by the same people who have also posted more recently - were even more critical than they are this year - possibly the shock factor was greater. The thing which slightly depresses me is that it is quite clear that both 'Macmillan Corporate' and their agencies - right from the very top downwards - can not, plausibly, claim to be unaware of the strength of feeling against this wretched campaign from the people they claim to be trying to help, yet they still went ahead with it again.",

One thing which disappoints me is how few Community Champions have given their support on this thread. I think the first step surely is for them,as a group, to represent the Community view on this to Macmillan and post their response. If they disagree that's up to them, but can they not post why? I suggest that every time you see a CC post on another thread you invite them to visit this one and post their views. For all we know, the views expressed here - including my own - although strongly held, may not be representative, and that would be something which would be useful to know as a start point.",
