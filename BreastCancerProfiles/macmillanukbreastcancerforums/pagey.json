    "Content": "Hi I have an implant and too had radiotherapy. I have tightening of breast which is the scarring from mx  and muscle around it and pain in shoulder. Feels like a big hand squeezing my implant. Considering a tug flap now as been told this may worsen over time. Six months out of rads.   X wish you luck as it's early days. Massage helps. ",
