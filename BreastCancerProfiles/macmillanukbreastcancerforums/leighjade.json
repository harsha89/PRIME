The best one which I think is amazing and I love him for it is my BMF saying \"That is so not cool!\". The worst one is from my ex (seven weeks split up)  \"We are not together anymore, I have my life and you have yours, I have met a girl, I can't handle this but I am so,so sorry this has happened to you.\" WTF????!!!!",

      "Content": "Hello all...again apologies for not being in touch for a while...it's all been a bit manic but I have continued to rad your posts and laugh and cry with you all. The good news is that I have done all the fertility treatment now and produced nine eggs which are now in a freezer waiting...apparently a good number :-) It is a bit worrying how attached I got to them watching their growth and progress over the last few weeks lol! It is still only about ten per cent success rate but at least I have tried...who knows maybe my fertility will be ok and I will be able to do it all naturally... I have been so focused on this that it is now a shock that chemo day is so close, I start on wed this week, 3 xfec and 3x tax so any words of wisdom or encouragement would be greatly appreciated...or hugs...love hugs :-)... Keep up the good work ladies...you are all bloody amazing!!! Love and hugs",

      "Content": "Hi everyone Sorry been AWOL for a while but I have still been getting threads to my phone so have kept up to date with everything and been thinkng of you all. Saxxy sorry to hear about your awful experience, hugs, and thank you, thank you,thank you fr your fart story!!!! Sassy well done for getting through your surgery and your calender idea sounds fab...you go girl!!! Annabel you are so strong, keep it up! And everyone else not mentioned - you're fab. With me it has been all a bit much as the realisation hit me that my life has completely exploded around me. I upped and left my flat, job, cats, life in Kenya to come here for treatment. ....Please don't think I am ungrateful cos I thank my lucky stars for the NHS but I had all my adventures set out and they did not include cancer at 33, I am jsut a bit bummed out at the moment  :-( On a more positive note the horrible, beastly 'alien' is gone! I had a lumpectomy on the 29th and it feels good to know the lump is gone. Advice though please - the scar is healing well but I did develop some bruising which has now gone hard - haematoma? I am going to go to the docs today to get it checked out. What do they do with it? Does it go on its own or have to be drained? I am due to start the fertility treatment this weekend, injections twice a day in my tummy which I do myslef. Hate needles so injecting myself is going to be fun.... Muuuuuuuuummmmmm?! Keep smiling lovely ladies and big hugs P.S I can't remember who  it was but someone mention the quote 'Life isn't about waiting for the storm to pass, it's about learning to dance in the rain.' Well, they do a giant wall sticker of that quote and I reckon we should all have it on one of our walls......keep dancing ladies xxxxx",
