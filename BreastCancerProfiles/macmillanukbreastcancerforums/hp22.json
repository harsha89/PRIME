      "Content": "Diagnosed March, 6 sessions of chemo, lumpectomy and finished radiotherapy December.  Thinking about returning to work.  Did private cleaning before all of this which I have decided to not go back as is physically hard work, 2 houses a day.   Just spent about an hour tidying my daughters bedroom as she has gone travelling, so good chance for a spring clean, and I'm exhausted and have back ache! Looking at maybe going back into admin work which is what I have done previously.  What sort of hours did people start off doing when returning to work?  Anyone found employers put off by the fact you have had cancer? I would be grateful for anyones experiences. Thank you, Alison x",

I have taken everything they have offered me.  As for chemo I had FEC-T. I only really struggled on the last two but I think I was just exhausted by then. Wasn't sick at all. Once my hair was gone I felt so much better. it's all growing back now my last chemo was July.  I actually quite like my new hair! All the best for whatever you decide.  I was diagnosed in March and couldn't imagine Christmas but we are nearly there and I'm still here, a much stronger person with a completely different outlook on life.  Take care,  Alison x",

Following that I had painful knees then very painful feet and ankles.  Probably only just started walking properly about 3 weeks ago.  Also had pain around my shoulder blade.  Was told this could be a side effect from the radiotherapy.  Had a couple of massages and it did improve.  I am finding if I do jobs around the house etc i still suffer.  Mainly when I get to bed.  It is just a dull ache but enough to keep me awake.  I have googled this and sounds like Rotator Cuff?  Has anyone else had this?

      "Content": "I only have 2 more sessions of radiotherapy and can't wait for Friday lunch time when its all finished. Its hard to believe I am here!  Our world was turned upside down on March 15th when I was diagnosed with Grade 3 invasive ductal carcinoma, 3.5cm,  zero lymph nodes.  I had 6 sessions of FEC-T, couldn't feel lump after the second one.  Hardest part was of course the hair loss but once it was gone I put my wig on and felt 100 times better. I went from wanting a bilateral mastectomy to just a lumpectomy in September and had a complete pathological response.  Started on Tamoxifen for 5 years and then will be switched to Anastrozole for a further 5.  Family history so had genetics test and luckily result was negative, relief as I have a 23 year old daughter. Its a long, hard journey but I have made it with the help and love of my wonderful family and friends.  I even managed to have an Afternoon Tea Party in August and raised £600 for Breast Cancer Research.  I will be continuing to do this every summer from now on. For all of you just starting on this journey, I wish you all the best and can only say by my experience you will get through it and probably end up  a stronger person, I definitely have. I would also like to thank this forum.  Its been so reassuring to be able to read stories of other women going through the same thing as me.  I won't be leaving! Good luck to all you lovely ladies on here. Take care, Alison x",
