      "Content": "Hi there Just wondering, I still have one more chemo to go but another year of herceptin. I am assuming the redness in face is due to hormone drug. Previously when I have a hot flush, it will go red then go back to normal skin colour.. But since last Tuesday, I  have a large blotch red area which is does not go away . Is this normal?To me, its very ugly looking. I will talking to specialist on Thursday. It's just that I'm getting married and the last thing I would want to go down the aisle with a large red face. Mind you i will have make up on. Also have found another lump in other breast on Wednesday. Was bit upset but my other half was here that day, thank goodness. Have contacted BCN but still awaiting appointment to see specialist. I assuming it is just a cyst or benign lump but not nice to discover a lump. This is the second lump found. Previous lump was a cyst but this is a much bigger lump. Have other ladies found the same? Do you appear to get more lumps during treatment? gerty01        ",

I was only presribed them today but in information leaflet it said the drug is used for bedwetting and problems with urine? to me that has nothing to do with nightly sweats? Also I am wary about taking them as it may cause sleepiness. Obviously I would take them at night.   What do you think?   gerty",

      "Content": "Hi Doctor came back today and he asked me to start on oxybutynin so I will try that. Even though the leaflet said it was different reasons. He will ring back on Thursday to find out how I got on with the drug. Bit nervous about it but I will be taking this at night due to sleepiness. He said it can cause dry mouth. Every person is different with drugs. Tamoxifen I think affected me from day one with regards night sweats not so sure about the hot flushes (if that is what I am experiencing also) since I was hot and cold internally before I started tamoxifen. I suspecting Herceptin has something with it. Prior to tamoxifen it wasn't a regular thing but now it seems to be every day. I don't think I go red in the face just inside my body. Gerty01        ",

Experiencing some joint pain in wrist. We are going turn down water temp. I haven't spoken to oncology doctor yet. Obviously have to be careful with any hot water and don't go into freezer to often. I am assuming that it will comes and goes and something just have to put  up with. How does anyone else cope with this symptom? How long after chemo this will stop? Thanks Deirdre            ",

      "Content": "Hi Dreamthief Thanks for thinking of me. How's your wife? It took me a while to work out how enter the breast cancer site to reply to your post!. Yes I can feel the hot water temp and cold temp. That's a relief on the part of hot water. I don't want to be scalded. I now wear gloves and my other half is doing all the cooking/washing up.  I saw the Onc doctor yesterday and I was with her for 40minutes as I had loads of questions. She reassured me and am less stressed and less worried than I was the previous week. all the symptoms I had were due to chem including sore calf muscles. I was told to take paracemotal and not ipruforen for aches and pains and hopefully don't  get neutpenia as the drugs will bring down temp if got temp.obviously check beforehand before taking tablets. I'm going ahead with no7 chemo of 8 on Monday. Just got a running nose. Keep getting that! I guess that's because there is no hair in nose. Gerty01            ",
