      "Content": "Thank you for all the kind wishes. No, I didn't have chemo last time. I was told it was DCIS which does not require chemotherapy. I had a bilateral mastectomy.  I was told yesterday that it is a breast cancer recurrance I'm dealing with this time, and that there was likely an invasive element to the DCIS in 2013 that they missed. That small element has now returned. ",

      "Content": "Hello.... I am 35 years old and had a double mastectomy with implant reconstruction in 2013 for DCIS. My mother died when she was 34 from breast cancer (I was 5 so I know little about the details).  On Sunday, I found a lump which seems to be attached or very close to a rib above the right breast (about 1 inch from the previous cancer site and about 2 inches down from the collar bone). My GP has referred me back to the breast clinic and I am terrified.  My tumour was 10cm in size and filled the breast.....could this be dropped cells?? Or a new primary cancer?? The lump feels so similar to my original cancer lump. I also believe that it is already growing in size but that's possibly my mind running away with me. Any feedback of similar lumps and outcomes would be appreciated. Thanks, AB ",

      "Content": "Morning all. Well I had my appointment yesterday, so the lump on my 2nd rib is a lymph node. Biopsies were taken from it and another lump they found under my arm and both have cancer cells within.  How can this possibly be..... My diagnosis 3 years ago was DCIS and I had a bilateral mastectomy and all the cancer was removed apparently.  So the cancer that is now in my lymph nodes, is either a part of the DCIS that was left behind, or a new primary breast cancer (which seems incredibly unlikely seeing as I only have minimal breast tissue left) or it is a new primary that has began somewhere else.....lungs, liver etc.  I have to wait for a CT scan, a bone scan and a Muga scan before chemo will start.  Fair to say that me and my husband are terrified. Our little boys (aged 5 and 3) don't know anything yet.  I am desperate to know what cancer I am dealing with here and what stage it is at.  The scans will be in 2 weeks. That's a loooooonnnnngggg wait.  Hugs.",

      "Content": "Thanks Julia. The GP didn't check my collar bone and neck.....but I'm confident there is nothing obvious there. He suggested the lump on the rib could be a cyst, a lipoma, a tumour on the rib or a recurrence.....so he covered all possibilities!  He said he'd refer me urgently so I should be seen within 2 weeks, however I was promised this in 2013 and was downgraded by the clinic because of my young age and ended up waiting 3 months for the diagnosis.  I hate the waiting and wondering.....",

      "Content": "Thank you for your replies. I have a appointment at the breast clinic on Monday 21st, which still seems like quite a wait! I had some malignant calcifications around the DCIS in 2013. I had clear margins after the mastectomy. But I'm now wondering if this lump I have now, could be some missed calcifications that were situated outwith the margins and therefore wouldn't have been removed? There was no scan after the mastectomy, the clear margins were relied on and trusted 100%. Also.....another suggestion I've had is scar tissue, but would that suddenly appear 3 years later? Hrm. I'd love some opinions on this please.  Thank you again.... Times like this I wish mum was here and I knew her story. ",
