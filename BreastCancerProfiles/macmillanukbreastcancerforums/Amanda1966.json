    "Content": "I have been taking Tamoxifen for the past year & have fortunately not had as many problems as yourself. I did get really bad night sweats and also extreme joint pain in my knees and feet. I have also been having acupuncture for about the same time and I have to say as soon as I mentioned the symptoms my acupuncturist said he would work on trying to get me some relief. I have to say he has worked wonders for me. I no longer have night sweats and the joint pain is almost non-existant. Hope that helps.",
