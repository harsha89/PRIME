    "Content": "Hi all and hello.  Just dropped by to check things out. Brief history - My sister was diagnosed with ductal breast cancer in spring 2011 then my mum was diagnosed with lobular breast cancer 2 months later and I myself was diagnosed with ductal breast cancer 16 months later in summer 2012. I had a lumpectomy and radiotherapy and was pleased as punch to reach my 5 yr milestone back in September. All the family recovered well from all treatments and are doing fine. Fast forward to nov 2017 and my routine annual mammogram showed an anomaly! So biopsy performed and I was diagnosed with breast cancer again. Result of which I had a mastectomy on Dec 27th as I couldn\u2019t have radiotherapy due to being the same breast again. I\u2019m recovering well with very little discomfort and waiting on results of tissue analysis from the op. I have everything crossed that the results will come back clear and that I won\u2019t need chemotherapy but I\u2019ll cross that bridge when I come to it.  Sorry for the long post but I am known to ramble on a bit lol.  No questions as yet but I\u2019ll be sure to ask if I think of any. ",
