      "Content": "Thank you all for the information, its particularly interesting about the brand, i never realised they contained different ingredients. I'm on the brand Teva,  by chance, so I will let you know. It's a horrid thing to have to face being on meds that seem to cause so many problems. But it is  really helpful to read all these posts, so thank you. I'm so very pleased to hear the oncotype test may be available on the NHS, I was hopeful it would be, it seems awful that some are having chemo maybe unecessarily?  as a belts and braces approach. Thanks to everyone Tamsy",

      "Content": " Hi, Im 4 weeks post surgery,  Ive just started hormone pills Anastrasole. There seem to be so many side effects listed and already discussed with the oncologist, I just wondered how any one else got on with it? And whats the most common side effects and how quickly do you get them? (I'm post menopausal ER pos)  Ive had a mastectomy and axillary clearance, and await my planning appointment for radiotherapy treatment. I had the oncotype test and was incredibly lucky to have a low score, so chemo was not reccomended as would not have benefitted me, huge relief. If any one is considering having the oncotype test i can only reccomend it, there is a good website which is worth checking out, which explains everything. Good luck to everyone.        ",

      "Content": "Yvonne Thank you for your prompt and informative reply, i think its better to know what to expect, although i know we are all different and get different side effects. Im very glad  to hear your joint pain is better on this one. I was told about the hot sweats, I too dont sleep well but am already on sleeping pills. Hopefully they will continue to work! Take care love Tamsxxxx",
