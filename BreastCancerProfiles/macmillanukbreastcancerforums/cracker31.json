      "Content": "Hi all. As of yesterday, I was told I have breast cancer, the lump is invasive, but I also have some other spots of calcification and they want to do another biopsy next weds in the mamogram, will get results on the Thursday.  To say the least, I was just expecting the lump to be removed, now they have made it clear it could be a mastectomy, am absolutely gutted and terrified. The other biopsy was don the previous Friday morning and I am experiencing aching and some sharp stabbing pains in the breast, is this normal? I am now thinking alsorts and am ok one minute the next in a state. xx",

      "Content": "Hi Sassy   Thankyou for that, I know it's silly to think that every ache and pain is the cancer growing, but I can't help it now. It has scared me so much, but I don't want it to take over my life. I am trying to carry on as normal. :-)  It's early days I know and still in shock. Cannot believe I have it really, you always think it will happen to somebody else and especially if there are no other cancer problems in the family!    I have alot of things going on in the next few months to keep me well occupied and busy. Thank you so much for your support, I know I will be back and would like to keep in touch.   <3 xxxx",
