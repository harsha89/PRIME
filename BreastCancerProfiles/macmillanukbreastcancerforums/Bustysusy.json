      "Content": "There is a very interesting item in today's Daily Mail regarding spa treatments. A lot of us will have been lucky enough to have been offered various therapies at our respect units. A lot of these will have included massage of some sort. The volunteer therapists will have been trained and assessed by Macmillan.  Likewise the lovely breast nurses we see during treatment. For those of us unlucky enough to develop lymphoedema, these same nurses tell us that massage will help reduce the swelling and show us the best way to do this. The article highlights the problems encountered when it comes to using spa centres. A day, or even an hour or two, being pampered can be an oasis in dark days of treatment. But too many therapists and their employers are loath to even see cancer patients. So, Danny Bell (specialist advisor for treatment at Macmillan) says in one part of his response that massage can help and in another that massage may cause lymphoedema.  So why are we being told (by our Macmillan trained) nurses that massage can be a problem? Which is it?",
