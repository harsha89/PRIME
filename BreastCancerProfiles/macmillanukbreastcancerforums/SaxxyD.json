I bought myself a stress ball to help my hands and that does seam to ease it but my feet are fine. Maybe you should see if reflexology might help or some gentle massage to help move the fluid as you may have a small amount of lymphoedema possibly? Chemo gave me swollen calves which was awful but a physio helped me with this. So please ask for help xx I hope the xrays can help pin point your pain...........and maybe doing some gentle excercise might help.

Tell your wife that when placing her food order i used to order two meals and they never charged me for what my hubby ate : -) i would just say to the lady that i wasn't sure what i could stomach and they were happy with that. Cheeky i know but hey ho. The other best thing is keep checking that she is comfortable and warm enough as chemo into the veins can make you quite cold. You can ask the nurses for blankets or hand warmers and that did me the world of good. All the best to you both as even though it is your wife going through the treatment, you too are affected by it all, so make sure you look after yourself xxx Eat well and drink lots of water....i have now drunk nearly 1000 small bottles of water since March...but it really does help keep your veins open and flush all the drugs out of your system.

      "Content": "Hi Babs This is the advice i can give you following my right breast mastectomy back in March:-   1. Drink lots and lots of water, this really helps your recovery. The hospital monitor what goes in and what comes out so the more you drink the faster, fingers crossed, you will get home. 2. You will need to do physio as soon as you get out of hospital. This will help with the movement in your arm but also help prevent the scar attaching itself to your chest wall, not good if you want a reconstruction in the future. 3. The drain is a little uncomfortable but you get used to it. 4. Stay positive as this phase really is one of the easiest to cope with, you may not think so now, but if you are having chemo you will know what i mean xx 5. Buy some E45 and some Bio Oil (i use one from PAI called Bio regenerate and it is working it's magic) as you need to keep your skin moisturised and the Bio Oil helps reduce the scarring. 6. The nuclear dye is an interesting one, stings for a little bit but you soon forget this. If i think of anything else then i will email you but you will be fine. Buy some zinc pills and pop 2 and this should stop the cold symptoms, we had tried and tested this and it really does work. Good luck for tomorrow and keep smiling lovely Babs this is the start of your journey to getting you back to normality xxxx",

Both scars are healing really well and i use E45 cream twice daily on them and the PAI Bio Regenerate Oil and the white scar tissue is forming really well. If you are having all your lymph nodes removed you will need to see a physio that specialises in cording two weeks after your op, as you may get tighting of the defunct drainage system. I have had real problems with this but my physio sorted out excercises that helps keep it under control. So please seek a physio out as you will need some special excercises. All in all though, now i am nearly 4 mths down the line, the chemo is worse than the ops. If you want to ask any other questions PM me and more than happy to help.

You will see a future with your family even with the big C, it will just be a little different and adapting will be a struggle but we can all struggle together as many of us are having a hard time getting our heads round the new us.

She has most probably gone into auto pilot like alot of us have done where you want to get everything organised before your treatment plan starts. My hubby was and still is amazing. He has been my rock from day one and tells me everyday how beautiful i am and that he loves me....but he did this before BC.. xx I showed my hubby how to do the chores because during this journey fatigue is not good and if you can help with these things i am sure your wife will love you even more. Try and do normal things as much as is possible and just run with the emotions that your wife shows because sometimes she may burst out crying but can't tell you why but a cuddle does go a long way. Talking is good for both of you as you have just as many questions and concerns as she does to ask i am sure so approach this in a gentle way and all will be good. Prepare yourself for a bumpy ride on this BC rollercoaster, hang on to your wife along the way as she will feel very fragile sometimes and give her lots of love and TLC xx and when she sees you are low she will do the same for you....my hubby showed his emotions and he never felt embarrassed or shut out. Stay strong and if you or your wife need to ask any questions then you know where we all are....just a click away xxx BIG HUGS to you both SaxxyD xxxxx",

Put strong clear nail varnish on and see if you can hang onto your nails for as long as possible to allow the new growth to get as far down your nail. Sorry to say but i have lost all 10 nails and one of my toe nails. But please don't be alarmed as they do grow back. Mine have got a ridge on them where the bad nail fell off and the new growth is. I would cut them level with the tops of your fingers to help avoid breakage. Keep them moisturised too as this will help. Remember everything that chemo takes away will come back so before you know it you will have lovely nails again xxx Any other questions just ask away xxxx",

      "Content": "HI Coot   I too had a single mastectomy......didn't really get on with the softie so wore a scarf to cover my missing booby. The prosthesis is much better, as weighted, and you really wouldn't notice the difference from the outside. My physio said that you need to wear the weighted prosthesis as much as possible otherwise your muscles will form differently in your torso. Then if you do have a recon you may get some back pain as your body isn't used to having the boob. Hope that makes sense!!! My recon is delayed as my surgeon said he wants all other treatments out of the way first. This is due to preserving the skin as best as possible (hence having 25 rad sessions at a slightly lower dose) and recon most probably won't happen for atleast a year after rads finish. I bought some mastectomy bras but to be honest the best bra i have found to hold my prosthesis in place in the seamless bra...it is amazing and looks so much more natural and is SOOOOO much cheaper!!!. I have just bought another 6 in nude, black and white. I defo would recommend these instead of the mastectomy bras as the prosthesis moves a little in the pocket and rises up and i do feel a little conscious when this happens, but not with the seamless bra...........maybe i have found my new job in life to go into promotion of these seamless bras...yeah xxx Well my chemo is now over, yippee, just rads to start on 24th Sept (tattooing this Thurs:-/ ) and then relax until recon. Taking one day at a time, one treatment at a time is key to getting through this journey we are all on. Believe me we will all get there. Lots of loving on this site which is fab so MWAH to all you beautiful, wonderful ladies xxx SaxxyD xxx",

They always came in my third week, which really peed me off, they could of come in week 1 or 2 but no number 3!!!!

My radiotherapy has left my skin a little sore especially around my shoulder area and armpit but this, i am told, should all disappear in 2-3 weeks. I start tamoxifen tomorrow, so a liitle nervous as you can imagine as going into the unknown again. I just hope that i don't get a barrage of side effects like i did on chemo and the next 5 years will be as comfortable as they can be. My hair, eyebrows, eye lashes and even my nails have all started to grow back and i can't wait for the day that i can do the following:- style my hair paint my nails without any bumps in them go out without a hat or scarf on to keep my head warm go to the loo without it ripping my bum apart ( i know you all know what i mean OUCH) get my brain back as it has been absent for too long enjoy my food without the weird taste buds kicking in go for long walks without getting tired after 10 minutes get back to my hula hoop for excercise and so many more but don't want to go on too long xxxxxx I never thought i would get through this year of treatment....but i have and it feels great, such a relief. It has been gruelling, stressful, tearful and emotional on this rollercoaster but i have also discovered who my true friends are, i've managed to have many laughs along the way (which i never thought i would do) plus i can confirm that i do have the best hubby in the world whom i love so much and can't wait to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary with next May.

It is so exhausting mentally and physically and i wish i could wave that magic wand and a cure be found xx I had my annual check up at the beginning of the month and the mammogram on my remaining boob was clear (even though i too saw white spots on the screen) but since the end of Jan i have had tummy pains...as if you are about to have a period but nothing happens...it comes in waves. So saw my GP who wanted some blood tests, urine (where they found blood and WBC count was high, so body is fighting something). I had an ultrasound done on Friday and they have found two dark patches which need to be investigated further so an MRI scan is being discussed between my GP and oncologist. God i hope it isn't more cancer (but sadly i too have the one that likes to spread anywhere) and the thought of having more chemo scares me silly. They can only get blood out of me now by using ultrasound!!! But like you have done.....i will face it when i know more....look at all the pros and cons and if more chemo is needed then a decision will need to be made. We too have booked some nice things to happen this year weekend in centre parcs in April, a party booked for our 25th wedding anniv in May followed by 6 days in Italy..............and i will be so disappointed if these have to be postponed as we cancelled everything last year.

The company is called PAI Skincare and i bought the following two products, one for my scar and one for sensitive skin. http://www.paiskincare.com This is the website and the two products i bought are called \"Rosehip BioRegenerate\" and the other is called \"Chamomile & Rosehip Sensitive Skin Cream\". Both are amazing and only made from natural extracts, even better. My scarring has improved so much that it is not as tight, smoother and even has white scar tissue forming and i only had my ops back in March....how good is that? The makeup classes from the Look Good Feel Better charity are amazing. I had mine yesterday and it was the best two hours i have spent in a long time. There were 12 ladies all with BC and only 3 of us had no hair but the three of us felt so comfortable that we sat there as bald ladies...fab feeling : -) This class is free on the NHS and if you go to their website you can see where your nearest class is being held. I recommend you all go because the top tips we were given were superb and the best bit is you get about £200 worth of products FREE!!! We all left that class with smiles on our faces and made new friends, amazing. The best bit was when i got home my husband said how beautiful i looked and how nice it was to see me beaming a HUGE smile....i felt great. So ladies if you need help with your scars, dry skin or makeup classes you now have everything you need to get them sorted. If you have any other questions please ask away otherwise enjoy xxx BIG HUGS to you all and remember any problems you have someone on here will have a top tip so thank you to everyone that has helped me and i hope the information i have provided will help some of you too.   XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",

But you will get through this xx Please make sure you keep a diary of the times when you take your drugs, as you do not want to miss any or take too many either, and what you are experiencing as this will help you on the other chemos. Also writing it all down helped get it off my chest (pardon the punn sorry xxx) and helped clear my mind and unburden me. Try it as it might work for you too. Every part of your body is being poisoned but remember chemo is not your enemy it is your night in shining armour kicking the crap out of your cancer......this will help you get through the low moments on this journey. If you are worried about anything then speak to your chemo nurse for things like your picc line or if something is weird. Your gut feeling is normally right and all the nurses are there to support you through this journey. We are here if you need any other advice and i am sending you over a nice bug cuddle to bring you a smile xxx PS - chemo drugs can make you fart alot more....so i say make them loud and proud....and defo better out than in :-))) xxx",

You do need to keep up your excercises and try and stretch your cording. You can stretch it by holding your arm in the air so the cord is stretched and then gently push on the cord to stretch it, not very comfortable but it does work. if someone can do it for you even better as i find my hubby can get more pressure on it than me. My cording goes from under my arm to my thumb so moisturising daily helps the cording too. Ask at your hospital if you have a physio that specialises in cording and they can provide support for you.

I bet they look beautiful xxx I have had my codring since the end of March and the physio has said i too have a bad case of it, so fingers crossed yours won't be like this and last as long. If you lift your arm straight above your head and push it backwards this helps stretch the cord in your arm pit. The other one that is good is to stand under your door frame, put your hand sideways on the side door frame as high up the frame as you can. If you are doing this with your right arm you need to then move your right leg forward and twist your body slightly and you will feel the cord stretching, this one is quite painful but does the job too. If you want me to email you some of my excercises which the physio gave me just PM me your home email address and i can do that for you ASAP. Glad you are feeling better in yourself, christmas is a time for fun, laughter and lots of festive cheer.

I take my pill every morning, easier for me to remember, and this has worked fine so far and none missed. Don't do what i have done and when someone suggests something to combat a side effect start taking it without checking with your onc first. I started taking royal jelly capsules and it knocked my hot/cold sweats from 12 a day to 1 a day...wonderful i thought.....until a friend (who is a nurse) told me that maybe i shouldn't be taking them as they produce oestrogen......oops my cancer feeds off oestrogen and tamoxifen is a blocker of so. Luckily no damage done. Keep a record of how they make you feel and then discuss it with your onc at your checkup which is around 6 weeks after you start. xxxx",

      "Content": "Hi Sue They found cancer in my sentinol node as well so 3 weeks after my MX i went back for a full clearance. I was only in for 3 days and only had my drain in at hospital, which is good because that was pretty uncomfortable but bearable. Within a week to 10 days all the dressings came off and it looked really neat. The main thing you need to do is your excercises, which are necessary to prevent you getting stiffness, cording and lymphoedema. If you can find a physio or nurse that specialises in these areas you can then work together to prevent any flare ups that you might have with your arm as once the lymph nodes are gone you have not much protection from infection. So you need to look after your arm really well. If you get a cut put savlon on it, it you get a hang nail don't pull it - cut it and put savlon on. Prevention is better than cure so i always have a mini medi bag that i cary with me that has savlon, plasters, antisepti wipes, insect bite stick etc etc. I also use PAI bio oil on my scars and it has worked wonders as they are so nice looking now and to be truthful the surgeon made the cut for my ANC just into the armpit so you really can't see it when you have a short t shirt or top on. So all is good and you are in the driving seat for your recovery......so don't do 100 miles an hour and think it should all be ok after a couple of weeks.....remember we all heal differently so listen to your body but keep up the excercises as they will help you tons for your movement in your arm. Also drink lots of water on this journey but anymore questions then please fire away and good luck with your op. xxxxx All the best SaxxyD xxxx",

I just see it as a new me doing things in a different way as this is my life now so don't get frustrated or scared.,.......you just need to rethink how you do things. These are a couple of the things i have changed so far:- Food shopping - used to do - weekly shop thinking nothing of carrying 4 bags at a time from the car to the house and over load my arms. new way - 3 weekly shop online for all items except fresh fruit, bread etc (you know the things you like to see and feel before you buy) plus every other day do a little light shop for these other items which i carry in my left arm. Gardening - used to do - a whole day in the garden weeding, mowing, chopping bushes etc and having a very enjoyable time. new way - hubby now mows the lawn as too heavy for me to push, my best friend (who loves gardening) now helps me weed, chop bushes etc. I can normally only do an hour or so of light duties before my arm aches but then i make the tea/coffee and still have an enjoyable time. As you can see just from the couple of examples above that changes need to be made but you can still have fun :-) You just need to be mindful not to over do things and avoid lots of repetition as this too can flare the swelling up. My hubby massages my arm to do manual drainage daily and he can get the arm thinner by up to over an inch and once he has done that the aching does subside. So if you don't know how to do manual drainage then please find a physio that can teach you as prevention is better than cure. I defo do not want an arm that is massive compared to the other because the fluid has been left to build up - bite size chunks are needed to avoid this. Hope this helps you understand that things have to change after this type of operation but you can still have lots of fun doing things xxxx Let me know what changes you make as some may help me and others on here xxx Keep smiling lovely lady xxxx",

All i can tell you from my own experience and i am now 13months on from diagnosis is embrace the people who support you and the ones that don't, don't bother with them. You need to focus on you through your treatment and worrying about how other people feel needs to not be on your agenda. Have coffees out with the ones who support you and believe me they will be there for you on your good and bad days.....superstars. It did hurt me to start with the ones who turned their back on me but the way i see it is it's their loss as i am a bloody great friend :-) Keep smiling lovely and embrace your lovely friends and family as you will need them xx",

Well i think i can top all of yours and yes you can laugh at this because we did. My sister in laws said (one in a card and one in an email) \"sorry to hear your news but get in touch with us when it is all over\"!!!! Cheeky sods i say....needless to say i haven't heard anything from them since Feb this year THANK GOODNESS do i need these sort of people in my life right now NO!!!! Through this journey, which we are all on you, discover who your true friends and family are and i say hold onto them because they are precious. I have one friend who now has the nickname of \"head gardener\" and she loves coming over and sorting out my veg plot...i just sit in a chair all huddled under a throw and we chit chat while she works. Hubby makes sure we both have lunch sorted before he goes to work, which i adore him for doing. I think what i am saying is please try not to get too down through this journey, as negative energies are so draining, as it is a long journey we are on. Surround yourself with positive people that can make you laugh, cry with you, hug you when you are down ... it really does make a huge difference. Just like the song says \"Don't Worry Be Happy\" This song actually played on the radio just as we were pulling up for my first chemo, so it is now officially my journey song. (even though M&S are now using in their advert...cheeky!!!) Take care lovely ladies...we are all beautiful inside and out XXXXXX  ",

The bruising took ages to come out but i think we forget this isn't surface bruising it is quite deep so it will take a little longer sadly. The drain holes seemed to take longer to heal, which was weird, plus i must admit were so uncomfortable in the hospital.

Sadly everyone varies with recovery timescales.....i wish we were all the same and then you would know what to expect...but that is utopia, which sadly doesn't exist in our world at the moment. We all react so differently to these poisons (sorry drugs !!!) and yes the fatigue is one of the most debilitating of them all i think. It is so frustrating when some of the simplest tasks that we could previously of done with our eyes shut seem to take forever and then takes ages to recover. I have resigned myself to the fact that i can't force my body to heal any faster and to accept this slow motion world i now currently live in....but it won't be forever!!! Positive thinking will get us through this xxx I have got another CT and bone scan this week as i have had a pain in my side for over a month now ( came on a week after my last chemo was administered) and my oncologist wants to rule out anything nasty and we hope it is just muscular/skeletal pain. Trying not to let nasty thoughts enter my mind so i just hope the results come back quickly. Good luck for your surgery this week and remember we are all here to support you on your next phase of your journey. I hope you can take up Cassie's offer of a get together, i know i would if i lived near anyone. Keep smiling lovely lady and hope you have a speedy recovery from surgery xxxxxx",

I too suffered with exactly the same and my hubby was so scared that he made sure that i rested and only did things in very short bursts. So a walk into town was a little too much for your wife i think. She needs to rest and listen to her body as this will be key to a speedy recovery. I tried to do a little gardening, just cutting a few dead leaves off my veg patch and as soon as i stood up i got dizzy and sadly fell over, which really did me no favours. So little things to start with for your lovely wife i think. You take care too as this is going to be a long journey for you both but good food, lots of water and rest are the best on this journey plus lots of loving from you will be great. We need to hear that we are loved and are still beautiful on this journey and my huby tells me everyday and it has made a huge difference. Take care and HUGE HUGS for you both xxx SaxxyD xxx",

I have been given two different brands, Sigvaris for the sleeve with mitten and Mediven for the glove.  I wear the sleeve with mitten all day, then hubby does my manual drainage before we go to bed and then i wear the glove to bed. The tighter compression is working very well but it is like groundhog day with the routine. They only gave me two of each as sadly the first order they put in i could of got both arms in one sleeve...nightmare....but i have asked for 8 in total of each as you really can only where them once before you need to wash them. Also last week i did a little bit of planting of wall flowers in my garden and sadly a thorn went through the two gloves i was wearing. Cleaned the  wound and put savlon on it but that evening it started to go red so phoned my GP in the morning and had a telephone appointment. She advised me to take the antibiotics she had given me earlier in the year for holiday for 5 days and to call again if it had not gone down within the next 48 hours, Luckily they started working and all is good so please get your GP on board with your preventative prescription. I hope this helps but i know i could not do the manual drainage myself, you need someone to do it for you to get best results so i hope you find someone to show you how to do it and you have someone who will do it for you. The difference between my arms is now down to about 1.25 to 1.5 inches. Take care lovely ladies and BIG HUGS xxx",

Having all the tests is so draining emotionally so i hope you had someone there with you for support, i had my best friend and hubby xx You will need to make sure someone is with you next week too as i found my mind just went numb and blank, so luckily my hubby and friend had a list of questions etc all prepared. All i can say is diagnosis does not mean your life is over .....it will change and during treatment you are in a weird limbo land.....but you do come out the other side. You need to now concentrate on getting your body and mind prepared and fit for what treatment lies ahead whether that be mastectomy/lumpectomy, chemo and/or rads.

Sadly I know quite a bit about lymphoedema and the compression sleeves, as i have been coping with it for the last couple of years, so let me see if i can help you :-) One thing i have learnt about lymphoedema is that you have to manage it  and manage it well .....now this could be with daily manual drainage, wearing a compression sleeve and/or glove to name just 2 that i do. I have seen and still see a lymphoedema physio and another who is a nurse and both have measured me for my sleeves and gloves and the physio also taught my husband manual drainage, which we do every day. Do you have a partner that would be happy to do your manual drainage for you, if you do then ask for them to be shown how to do it. I have mine done while we watch TV. If i have a rebellious day and i leave my sleeve off.....boy do i pay the price in the evening. So this is done very rarely now. The best advice i can give is seek a specialist in lymphoedema local to you....if you live in Kent let me know and i will pass you onto two ladies that look after me, sadly my hubby is not available to rent :-) I did find that if i wore the compression sleeve that finished at the wrist my hand would swell up so i now have the combined one that goes over the thumb. You may find that this could help you too? Thank goodness we can get the compression garments on our medical exemption card as you will find you will need to replace them every few months. I use my old ones when i work on my art as it doesn't matter if they get grubby and bobbly. They can get covered in paint or pastels and keep me happy doing what i love. I really hope this helps but if you need to ask anymore questions please let me know. Big Hugs SaxxyD",

I think this journey makes you re-evaluate your work life balance and what you want out of life. No-one knows how long they have left and that includes people who have not been diagnosed, so i think you need to assess what is important to you and if changes are needed then don't be afraid to make them. I haven't worked since mid Feb and i am due to see my occ health from work at the end of rads as they want to assess what i can do work wise as anything repetitive can bring on my cording and lymphoedema....so who knows what they will suggest as all of my job is repetitive!!! Hopefully you have someone who is supporting you, so have a chat with them or a close friend and air your worries as a problem shared is great, as others may have some wonderful suggestions. Yes the C can come back....none of us have any guarantees....but please try and put this to the back of your mind and live life to the max, don't let cancer eat you up........you are worth more than that. I hope this helps ....... i hope we can all keep smiling and have a laugh as positive thinking is so important through this journey we are all on. We are all beautiful people......never forget that !!!!!",

      "Content": "Hi Mary Everyone reacts so differently to the tax side effects, some good some bad. If you notice the drug is in a black bag because it is light sensitive, which is why they recommend wearing dark nail varnish. I have now lost 5 fingernails, but it's not as bad as it sounds. You could see the new nail growth underneath so my nails have a ridge in them. I had tax only once and that was chemo 4 and i had my last chemo FEC reduced on 28th Aug and my nails are only just coming back now. I did wear dark nail varnish all the way through chemo and used the nail cream the nurses gave me. My toe nails have been fine, just a little yellow. But my fingernails looked like i had smoked 80 fags a day!!!! yuck. Fingers crossed you will not lose them but if you do it really isn't so bad - honest : -) it just feels really weird as if you have bitten them down too far or broken a nail badly....but that feeling didn't last long.

They are there to give your body a boost as Tax is pretty strong. I have everything crossed that you will be fine xxx Anyone going through this on there own i hope will be a strong, determined and positive person. Don't be shy of asking for help from friends and family......they will only be too pleased to help support you. I know i have a super hubby but my best friend looks after my garden and veg patch. She drops everything if i need something and at the end of this journey we will be treating her and her hubby to a really nice weekend away to say thanks. Anyone doing this on their own - never fester at home alone please ....not a good place to be as you need to be in the zone of battle stations to get through this journey. Eat well, drink lots of water and gentle excercise is the key plkus positive mental atitude really helps. But when you get your low days (which we all get) go with your emotions, never hold it in.

If your hubby ever wants someone to talk to my hubby is right here for him just like i am for you.......please never feel alone as you are not!!! The mac nurse should have asked you what books you wanted to have left and not just given you those ones...as you are both very sensitive at the moment, which is understandable, since you have had such a torrid time this year. All i can ask is that you stop looking and trawling sad negative things and only look up nice things to try and stop this downward spiral that you are on. I know you are both scared, none of us want to have cancer but sadly we have it. But somehow you need to focus on the nice things in your life together with your family and before you know it these dark times will be behind you and will be a distant memory.

I have one more chemo next Tuesday and then 5 weeks of rads that finish end of Oct and i can't wait. Just thought i would give you some help with your arm. It is aching and getting lymphoedema due to your nodes being removed so the drainage system in your arm is now not working. See if you can go to a local physio that specialises in cording and lymphoedema and they will give you some exercises and show you how to do massage and manual drainage on your arm. Prevention is key as there is no cure as such so getting advice and guidance is priceless. I know i would be in deep dodo's if i didn't do my exercises and massage daily. Hope this helps and well done again for finishing your treatment, i can't wait to join you. Let us know how you get on with Tamoxofin as i too will be on this for 5 yrs xxx BIG HUGS - SaxxyD xxxx",

      "Content": "Hi Caryn I totally agree with the great advice KateG has posted for you. From my experience following my MX and ANC back in March you need to make sure you see a physio within 2 weeks of your op to ensure you start the right exercises. My physio was great and covered both cording and lymphoedema exercises. She also taught my hubby how to do massage and manual drainage as prevention is better than cure, as these are life long conditions for us. She also said at night prop your arm up on two pillows, so that your wrist is higher than your shoulder. This way you will get a good number of hours natural drainage. Avoid, if possible, sleeping on your side where you have had your nodes removed to help avoid fluid build up....quite difficult to do both of these but you do adapt. Also i now carry round with me everywhere a small bag with savlon, antiseptic wipes, insect bite spray and factor 50 sunscreen as you never know when you might need them. You need to act fast if you do break the skin so having this to hand is invaluable. Keep up the exercises and all will be good. All the best to you, stay positive and keep smiling :-)) xxxxx SaxxyD",

I drank loads of water which helped. Week 1 & 2 i was a hermit as felt like poop plus week 2 is your low immune week so didn;t want to risk catching anything. Week 3 was my salvation and took small trips out with friends to make me feel normal.......whatever normal is!!! My hubby used to take me out to lunch after bloods, so before my next dose of chemo, and it was wonderful. So if you have a partner or friends and family you can do this with that would be great to help you. Do you have someone that stays with you during chemo? My hubby stayed with me the whole time and it really does make the time go faster and take your mind off having the drugs pumped into your arm. Listen to your body.....it has a way of telling you if you need something (food or drink wise) or if it isn't happy. Never Never feel that you can't speak to your chemo nurse as you do not want to be seen as a pain....you are not and they will be able to give you medicines to help you with all sorts such as sore mouth, constipation, sore bottom, nausea, sore head.....the list is long but everything you go through will have a means of easing the discomfort and helping.

      "Content": "Hi Everyone I haven't been on here for some time. I was part of the 2012 group of newly diagnosed BC ladies and we formed some great friendships, a lot of ladies i still see and speak to regularly, plus Annabel's Angels Charity was created out of us losing one of our dear friends Annie40. I am proud to say i am one of the trustees of this charity, which was set up by Annie's hubby. I just wanted to share with you that life does go on after diagnosis and i am living proof of that...so this is what i have been up to since my diagnosis:- Diagnosed Feb 2012....lost most of 2012 to operations, chemo, rads, lymphoedema and cording and goodness knows how many hospital visits. I was unable to return to work so in 2013 i joined an art class and started  learning to paint and draw (something i never did at school) This has now developed into something that i love and i can truly say art has been my saviour and i can now enjoy running my own art business where i do commissions for clients of their beloved animals, wild life and so much more. So please don't give up on yourselves, your treatment plan is gruelling but do-able........life really does go on after diagnosis and i never thought i would say how lucky i am.........cancer may of taken a lot away from me but it has given me the gift of art which is priceless. So keep smiling lovely ladies and who knows what your futures hold but let's hope it brings you all lots of good things and good times. Big Hugs and love to everyone SaxxyD xxxx www.dennyart.co.uk    (if you want to see what i have created in art please take a look xxx)",

If your tongue is white and swollen you may have oral thrush which you will need to get a mouth wash for and clean your tongue daily too. Nail beds are so painful but you can also get a liquid that you squeeze on the nail and rub and it really works. It's called OnicoLife drops!!! To be honest any side effect that you have you can get a cream, lotion, mouthwash etc for so seek help with these ASAP please....why suffer!!!!!! It took me a few weeks to recover from the reaction i had to D but had my 5th chemo yest but it was reduced FEC and touch wood the side effects are milder. But the nausea, hot sweats, red face and achy bones are still not nice.......but nearly at the end yippee :-)) Good luck to everyone and remember keep smiling lovely ladies xxxx",

I still wear hats as it is a little chilly and my mum knitted me two lovely ones for bed..but i have around 8 hats that i choose from in the day time. I never wore hats before but i defo will carry on wearing them now. The greyish chemo look does wear off so hang in there. I have been very sad and kept a photo diary of everything since diagnosis because i just can't believe how far i have come. I was diagnosed in Feb 2012 but we look back at photos from Oct 2011 (which is when i first had back pain) and i look like i have a twinge of yellow....weird!! I hope someone else gets the support and comfort from Twiggy as i did....she did me proud. Yes another milestone achieved YEAH xxxx",

Sadly they expect the old you back but the old you is long gone and there is a very different new you...one that they need to come to understand. My boss was great at my OH/HR meeting she said that she new as soon as i was back she would be demanding things of me that sadly my body and mind can't cope with now......and she would not feel comfortable with that. So sadly i will not be returning to work. From diagnosis our world is dominated by hospital appts, test results, operations, scans and treatment amd it sweeps us off our feet. Then afterwards when all treatment is finished we are on our own....or so it feels and we have time to dwell and recall what the hell just happened over the last year. This can turn to bitterness and anger towards cancer so i hope you have got some close friends who you can vent off at, but never take it personally, and can support you in this cloudy moment you are experiencing. But it will be just a moment.....it will pass (just like this snow) and you will feel happier in yourself. Just don't beat yourself up...you have to go with the flow...and remember you have a lovely family around you. Stay strong while riding this stormy phase xxxxx sending you a BIG HUG my friend xxx",

My surgeon told me straight away that a recon would not be possible with this diagnosis as my treatment plan needed chemo and rads as well as the MX. Rads can damage a recon which is why they say you need to not have a recon for atleast 12 months post rads......so there is a wait sadly. Normally a MX amd ANC are done within a month or so of diagnosis so i am sure the NHS will fit you in ASAP. What you said about your lump, that you should of found it sooner as it was huge......well mine was 50mm....massive in my B cup bra.....but i know that this appeared very quickly...so don't beat yourself up about not finding it sooner.

When i was having my chemo i asked the nurse about this issue as well as cording and she got me to see one of their physios and she was an angel. She gave me specific excercises to do and they are definitely helping so see if you can see a physio who can help you too. It will get better just feels very strange at the moment as your movements feel very restricted. The good thing she told me is the scar tissue will detach itself, great, and will aid me if i go for the reconstruction later down the line. Also i am using a bio-oil from PAI which is realy helping smooth my scar out.   Hope this helps....BIG HUGS xxx",

I think a biopsy is the best way to go for you as scans sadly do not give conclusive outcomes. It doesn't help when the specialists don't have any answers either....so frustrating!!! All i can offer is a BIG HUG and say fingers crossed all will be good for us both and i really can't wait for this shitty trip to end as it is now getting on my tits (or tit hehehe xx). I have had 8 rads so 17 to go and the ladies are all wonderful that look after us during rads but the daily trip is getting a bit tiresome. Tomorrow i am visiting 3 hospitals one for rads and onc meeting, 2nd for physio and 3rd to see BCN as my prosthesis is leaking.......lucky me xx Keep smiling lovely Shelley and lets hope all is good for us both.

Button up nightshirt or PJs as easier to use with the drain 3. Cartons of pure fruit juice and drink lots of water, they monitor what your intake is and what you wee out. 4. Deodorant wipes (found online at Amazon and if you order today they will be here by Thurs). Very gentle on the skin or you can use baby wipes they smell gorgeous too. 5. Magazines to read as books i struggled with as kept falling asleep. 6. A tucker box which had dried fruit and nuts in as i did get peckish in between meals. 7. A cuddly toy........always cheered me up : -) 8. Baby mouthwash to use in the daytime as i was paranoid at having bad breath, even though i cleaned my teeth twice daily. The drain isn't too bad and after 1st night in hospital, when they made me use a bed pan and then a commode i was wheeling myself and my drain to the bathroom for a wee, much better. I really hope this helps and good luck for Friday, all will be good xxxx PS go with the flow of your emotions and never feel embarrassed to show them....i think we are entitled to be a bit up and down with what we are all going through.

Bone is all clear but sadly CT has showed a mass in my right armpit so onc has organised an ultrasound and biopsy for Monday and she will see me next Friday with the results. If it is cancer then she said i will have to another op to remove the mass then have more chemo (lucky me NOT!!!) and possibly more rads. I am only two weeks into five for this current rads cycle so she said i will need to finish this and also start Tamoxifen at the end of Oct..........crikey so much to think about. Trying to stay positive and not ruin weekend thinking about worse case scenarios. Sorry if anyone else has had poo results but we have got to find the inner strength to pick ourselves up and soldier on. Bloody C is gonna get a right good kicking off me if it has reappeared.

He can use this to rest under his arm to take some of the weight when his arm is down. Plus also my parents bought me a soft V shaped pillow and this helped me sleep at night. Keep a note of what pills he takes and when as he doesn't want to take the pain killers at the wrong time....and boy did this help us as we would both of forgotten...and goodness knows what that could of led to xx I didn't fancy a lot to eat so homemade soups were good as packed full of goodness, even if he only has a small cup full.. Get lots of bottled water in as he needs to keep up his fluids. Don't panic if a seroma appears (small fluid filled lump) under his arm, it will feel like he is holding a tennis ball under there....not nice but all he needs to do is ask them to drain it for him. I had mine drained 3 times and all was good after that. Lots of TLC but please also make sure you look after yourself as it is easy to forget about the person doing all the caring and running around xxx Also have you got a medical exemption card for him yet as he will now qualify for one. No more fees to pay YEAH.....got to some perks to having the big C lol xx Oh just thought......in hospital ask your hubby if he would prefer you to give him a bed bath instead of the nurses.......i'm glad my hubby did it for me.

      "Content": "Hi wendle welcome to our little club xx let me put your mind at rest just because the cancer was found in some of the lymph nodes this does not mean automatically that your hubby is going to die xx My cancer was found in my nodes too last March and i had all of mine removed on the right side. The lymph nodes were doing their job by preventing it going elsewhere, which is excellent news. Your hubby needs to make sure he does his excercises as he may develope cording and lymphoedema.....but please don't panic these are both treatable with excercise and massage. See if you can get booked in with a physio that specialises in these conditions and if you go along you can learn how to do the massage technique to help your hubby. My hubby was taught and he loves doing the massage so al will be good so please put your mind at rest. It's only natural to worry but always good to chat these worries through and we are here to help anytime xx He needs to focus now on getting himself mentally and physically ready for chemo. Good luck xxx",

BEST FRIEND - looking after my garden and veg plot all year, reading to me in hospital, sitting with me when i was in so much pain on tax, coming into my biopsy appt and holding my clammy hand, phoning me every day, coming to the look good feel better workshop, coming on any appointments that hubby couldn't make ........to name just a few things. PARENTS - flying in from Spain to be with me for my MX and to support hubby, phoning me every day, skyping monthly, telling me really bad jokes, researching things for me when i couldn't ........to name just a few things. Other friends taking it in turn to sit with me so i was not alone and taking me out for little trips to stop me getting cabin fever. I would have been lost without the love and support of my darling hubby, close friends and family and i feel very priviledged to have them in my life. All you lovely ladies on here too that have given me such support, hints, tips and great guidance...it really does mean a lot so THANK YOU :-) xxxxx",

I did a grade 1 and got hubby to do it for me and we tok soem pictures, had a few tears but i think that is natural. I did dab soluble paracetamol on my head which eased the pain a little so i could sleep better but got fed up in the morning eating my own hair on the pillow so off it came. I had 3 FEC 1 Tax but then because of my rare reaction they put me on FEC reduced dose for my last two chemos. Because i had to wait 6 weeks before i could have chemo 5 my hair had started to grow back but my chemo 6 it has fallen out again...but not worried as my eye lashes and eye brows have started to grow back so my hair will follow soon i am sure. Got lots of hats, scarves and one wig (Twiggy) so i will be fine. Just can't wait to have my Annie Lennox look soon : -))   Take care and hope this info helps you xxx",

I think one of the main things that helped me was that i sat down with my hubby and we were both totally honest with each other about how we were both feeling, as it does affect your whole family. We promised to talk openly, cuddle often and go with the flow of our emotions. You can't help being morbid.....we went out and did our wills, how mad is that, but they did need doing as we had put them off for years. The waiting game is awful and you can't switch your mind off but once your treatment plan starts you feel as though you are finally getting somewhere. A good cry helps xx You will find out on this journey who your true friends are and sadly which family members are supportive. I have got a right pain of a sister and her reactions have been appalling so we just limit her contact now as it is too distressing. It is amazing, but once the initial shock has passed, you will find an inner strength which will help you through this journey. This site has been fab and helped so many of us....stay strong lovely lady BIG HUGS to you xxxx",

I couldn't tpuch my scar for ages too but as time went by and i got used to seeing myself naked it got easier.....but it does take time so don't beat yourself up about it please xx I think my prosthesis, because it is such a good match size wise, makes me feel more comfortable in clothes and i have just started to wear tighter tops and not big baggy jumpers anymore....mind you the jumpers are good to wear in this crappy weather xx Do you have a partner that might be able to help you with this problem?............we as ladies need to feel sexy and beautiful too and this has only just really started to happen to me this year...thank goodness.

      "Content": "Hi aussie-aimes I totally sympathise with your thrush sadly the antibiotics give us these nasty side effects, which thrush is one of. Me personally i would go and but the caneston pessary and cream combo so atleast you can feel something working, but contact your GP tomorrow morning and get seem straight away. I must admit my GP has been great and if i phone up at 8.30 i get seen before 10am..it's like we are on a priority list becasue we have BC. The other thing you can use is natural yoghurt....bit messy but very soothing. Hope this helps but the GP may prescribe something stronger for you...hope you have got your medical exemption card as this BC with side effects can get mighty expensive with all the drugs and pills we need. Tale care my lovely friend and good luck xxx",

Your nodes are only doing their job of preventing the cancer spreading so don't get too worked up if they find it there, but fingers crossed it won't be xxx Waiting for results is the worst thing ever so will be thinking of you on the 11th xxx Here if you need us xxx",

I suppose a way to look at it could be - is radiotherapy a must for your cancer?......if yes then don't be bullied into doing the trial....you should be entitled to the normal rads on the NHS anyway. Only do the trial if you feel 100% happy about it. Stay strong xxxx",
