    "Content": "Hi I am now nearer my 3 years cancer free after diagnosis mark - and I can honestly say that last year I went through a very 'uncontrolled' state - I was way up one minute and way down the next - not what I was expecting at all.  I had already gone through the lumpectomy and double mastectomy the year before, and thought that my emotions would stabilise - I was so wrong.  I was acting very irrational - very scared for my future and the future of my family.   At the end of last year I underwent a salpingo oophorectomy and a nipple reconstruction, and I just collapsed.  I couldnt think straight and just wanted to hide away.  I felt I had had enough and didnt want to hear from anyone else.  I ended up taking one day, one hour, one minute at a time, giving myself some space.  I felt like I had forgotten how to breathe.   It's like going through the grieving process, you don't get over your loss, you just end up building your life around it so then it becomes the norm. Take care, Ange",
