    "Content": "Last week my partner found a lump in my left breast. I went to the doctors but she couldn't find it but has referred me anyway just to be on the safe side. As soon as I got home and had stopped shaking I found it myself so know it's definitely there. I'm absolutely petrified, I lost my beloved auntie to breast cancer a few years back. I'm only 32, a mummy to 4 with my youngest only 16 months. I have an appointment at the breast clinic on Tuesday. since my partner found the lump and I've found mr bloody google, I keep reading of symptoms and now seem to be able to relate to some that i wouldn't have if I hadn't known. Tbh I'm not actually sure why I'm writing all this, I feel abit lost atm x",
