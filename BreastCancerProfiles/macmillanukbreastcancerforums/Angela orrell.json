Your situation is really difficult one, you should get lots of help from your named nurse and i have no doubt they will keep a very close eye on you and baby, there is a group called chemo mums in Bolton maybe there is something where you are also goverment scheme called homestart who can help out when baby is born-ask your midwife or healh visitor. This is me all over miss practical!! i hope all goes well on Tue my chemo has gone really quick can't believe i am half way thers already x |Angela",

      "Content": "Up to now mine has not been that bad, been able to carry on more or less as normal and it has gone really quick, you tend to see loads of horror stories. I have been tired and yes my guts have not been great!!, i have met lots of younger women at the unit where i get my chemo and we all have a moan but we are all doing fairly well on it.My hair fell out quickly and i hated the sensativity on my head so i had it cut short then a skin head!! which was quite liberating. i have got so used to seeing myself bald i wonder what i looked like with hair now!! over 50's seem to have a rough time. i tend to go out for a walk if i feel tired rather than sitting thinking oh i'm ill i need to sleep. as you can imagine 3 children keep you occupied. i take me time and have free commplementary therapy through a cancer support centre having reiki at mo. I have not had my op but having full masectomy about Oct followed by radio. i have just found out my cancer is HER2+ which means it's aggressive 1 in 4 apperantly. My consultant wants to give me wonder drug herceptin for 1 year following radiotherapy. it's a drip every 3 week. that was a bit of a shock thought i would be done by new year. let me know how chemo goes.

      "Content": "Hi, i too found out while pregnant, there is never a good time to hear such bad news, but pregnancy sends your emotions on a roller coaster anyway. I was told day before 3rd baby was due and had an induction. I had a baby boy and was given VIP treatment at the mat unit and everyone was very supportive. I am half way through Chemo now and it's going ok, my children are the one of the things that keep me going, and although your heaad may be filled with doom and gloom at this time things do get better and holding your baby will never seem as precious. i really do hope all goes well for you , your baby is very special he/she may have saved your life as there is evidence to suggest that there is a high rate of diagnosis in pregnancy and all being well they will have caught this early on and fix u up soon enough. angela",

      "Content": "hi again, On treatment 6 tommorrow 2 more to go !!! yipee!!, been a bit more tired each time but not too bad, i did feel more toxic each time (that sounds really awfull-but i mean i was aware it was building up a bit each time, Taxotere has made me more tired first week after treatment) . But like you I try not to let it get to me, but do rest in your condition!! but a walk does help get rid of fatigue i found. Have you asked for Mummys lump free book from cancerbackup it's a great illustrated book which you can read to your child and it helps explain to them and the well meaning adults who are usually more worried than you and induce panic in you when you are trying to be positive!! keep in touch. love Angela x",

      "Content": "Hi sally, I was thinking of you on Tuesday, i had the epirubicn and cyclophosphide, The red wee is a great fun for the children to look at!! if it's same as mine you may experience a bit of a toxic type feeling as you have more treatments and it builds up, by toxic i mean you become aware that you have powerful stuff inside you, I burped alot during treatment and for about a week after i felt like i had ate raw onions. I know excactly what you mean about the Tequila effect, drink plenty water after your treatment and make sure you have a light snack before you go. keep me posted and please ask me anything i will try to help or at least cheer you up. is baby starting to mooch about? do you know what you are having yet?
