      "Content": "Hi all,   Number 2 - could have been worse! on the weight gain issue, I put on 2 pounds per week for the first 4 weeks on tamoxifen and it was a result of my thyroid giving up the ghost (pardon the pun) . please get your thyroid checked, it may well have been a victim too, especially if you have been radiated in that area. now 11 years later and the pesky little sucker has emerged in my bones, I'm back on tamoxifen and the aching bones and insomnia - but ha, I look good considering and it could be worse in cliche ville.   cheers Cathie ",

      "Content": "Hi ladies, I finished chemo 10 years ago and still have my curls. I had slightly wavy hair before and my hair came back completely grey and curly. The grey disappeared quickly and now that my hair is shoulder length it is still curly and I could be I an 80's big hair band! I love my curls , I can blow dry it straight or let the humidity where I live give me a natural Afro . I can miss a haircut and no one notices, cheeky people say that I could protect an endangered bird species in my curls!  Celebrate life and let your curls celebrate with you cheers cathie ",
