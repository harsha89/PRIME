      "Content": "Hi there, so happy to hear your treatment has gone well and you\u2019re free of this awful disease! It does give me hope.  Everything is moving so fast yet we don\u2019t know the full picture yet. I can\u2019t stress enough what great health she\u2019s been in, no cancer before, and the night before she was diagnosed she was doing her intensive exercises classes as usual. Today we walked 10 miles before rushing back for her hospital appointment tomorrow morning. It\u2019s so hard to fathom, the diagnosis has knocked us for six.  Very best wishes to you, long May your good health continue. ",

      "Content": "Hi LeoLady, My partner and I have just travelled back home urgently after getting a call this afternoon for her to go to \u201can urgent bone scan\u201d tomorrow morning. She had her breast cancer diagnosis last Wednesday and her CT on Sunday.  We\u2019re both just so afraid right now, we\u2019re not told why exactly they\u2019re doing things and are fearing the worst. I\u2019m terrified of losing her.  Do others here have any insight into how certain hospitals diagnose? Totally at a loss to know what\u2019s routine and what\u2019s seriously wrong.  So worried right now...",

      "Content": "Thank you so much Sue,  We\u2019d got away from where we live for a few days and got a call to come back immediately. It\u2019s the way they described it as \u201curgent\u201d totally threw both of us. Because she had the CT scan on Sunday we assume that they\u2019ve requested the bone scan because of this, that\u2019s why we\u2019re particularly worried.  We walked 10 miles today and she\u2019s been in fantastic health, it\u2019s so hard to fathom anything right now.  Thank you so much for your speedy response. I hope there is better news soon. Very best health and happiness to you also xx",

      "Content": "@leolady56 (hopefully I\u2019ve done that right...), thank you so much. The replies were all very helpful! We got away but then had the dreaded call from the hospital requesting she attend an \u201curgent bone scan\u201d the next day so we had to rush back to where we live that evening. Utterly stressed but the scans preliminary findings were that \u201cnothing nasty\u201d had been found. That\u2019s what we were told at the scan by the lady who was doing it.  My partner has a further MRI tomorrow and a biopsy on a lump they so far haven\u2019t inspected next week. We were also told today that she will get her results at a meeting on April 3rd. Already my mind is racing at the prospect of attending this and how we ought to prepare. How do people get through it?  We\u2019re trying to stay positive. The bone scan looks clear, her health is otherwise great, and she has virtually no symptoms - the breast pain is mostly from the biopsies right now.  I hope your course went well, it\u2019s a fantastic thing you all do.  Best wishes, ",
