I also have private health insurance through work so apparently I can use this to get another opinion or be operated privately etc. I really don\u2019t know what to do about that. The NHS has been brilliant so far. Guess I\u2019ll wait to see what the surgeon says. I\u2019m sure everyone goes through the same thoughts. I just keep thinking \u2018what if it\u2019s spread\u2019 doom doom and then \u2018oh it\u2019ll be fine I\u2019m 59 I only need another 10 years\u2019 and then starting to cry.

It\u2019s such a shock isn\u2019t it? And I\u2019m sorry you lost your mum. But I guess we should be grateful we are screened regularly because otherwise we would have no idea if there is no visible indication. I just never thought I\u2019d get bc. Everyone in my family gets heart disease and breathing stuff and I just assumed I was low risk for this - but I\u2019ve learned so much in the last 3 days! I\u2019m going to try to be as fit and strong as I can be for the treatment - even if it makes no difference it might make me feel more in control.  That\u2019s what messes with your head - the feeling of being out of control and in a state of uncertainty. But it happens to so many women.",

It\u2019s in the countryside and I always love the drive there and then we have tea and cakes and take the dog for a walk in the fields. I\u2019m just in pieces thinking about it. Why did I never appreciate before what a joy to do something like this without any worries? I know it\u2019s illogical to think like this and I feel weak and silly. I\u2019d allowed myself yesterday to feel bad and today I was going to crack on, but I just keep spontaneously crying. I think it\u2019s the shock. Sleepless21 I really appreciate your account of your methods of coping. I\u2019m going to try to do similarly. Did you get your counselling via the doctor\u2019s? I have my surgeon appointment on Friday and then I can make some decisions. I didn\u2019t really ask much at my diagnosis so I don\u2019t know anything except that the cancer is in the ducts and it\u2019s 2 cm and they left some sort of metal marker in the breast. The BCN said as I was leaving that they had checked the lymph nodes under my arm with the ultrasound and couldn\u2019t see anything. I\u2019m not afraid of treatment or surgery. I am afraid of all the waiting and not knowing what any of it really means and worrying it has already spread elsewhere. I guess that\u2019s the same for everyone though. Ugh!
