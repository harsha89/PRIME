    "Content": "Just wondering if anyone can help with knowledge / opinion / or support here: I've just been reading my Pathology Report leaflet (had a 13mm, invasive ductal, hormone receptor positive, lymph nodes negative, lumpectomy in Nov and next week I will be finishing radiotherapy) I have just seen that my report states \"yes\", there are signs of lympho-vascular invasion.  My Breast Cancer Care pathology report leaflet states \" people with lympho-vascular invasion are more likely to have chemotherapy recommended \" Lympho-vascular invasion was not discussed with me at my results appointment, nor was chemotherapy. I have literally just found this out tonight from my pathology report.  Should this have been discussed? Should I be having chemotherapy?  I feel confused and sick. ",
