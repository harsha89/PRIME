I did do the exercises regularly, as suggested, three times a day, but easy to forget when they get easier, to be honest.  If you ensure you take pain relief a little before trying to do the exercises and rest for a good while afterwards, you'll find things improve surprisingly fast.  Hugs xxx",

I was lucky in that a skin scrape was possible and I am fairly happy with the result, I\u2019ve a good cleavage if I wear a lowish cut top but do need a slightly padded bra as they are sisters but not twins!  Good wishes with your decision, remember you are a statistic of one, and the surgeon will be guided by your wishes. hugs xxx",

I\u2019ve duly had mammograms, ultrasound and biopsies, then in to see the surgeon.  Now I\u2019ve had surgeries on that boob, in the days that they used to remove cysts and once also had a massive haematoma so there\u2019s most likely lots of scar tissue. So I was dubious already as to what may happen. The surgeon told me I\u2019d most likely be looking at a mastectomy, possibly chemo and/or radiotherapy. So I do have a bit more of an idea....

So opted for the permanent implant, which my surgeon was happy to perform. I didn\u2019t need chemo or radiotherapy.  Pain-wise, my team used a drip feed of local anaesthetic into the wound, which lasts a day or so, after that all I needed was regular paracetamol (and lots of rest)  hugs xxx",

He then insisted the whole lot due within the next 10 days be done and signed ready for him today!  They aren\u2019t usually this bad, it was odd that it often seems to be him, his GP is probably the budget holder for the practice, and often at the other surgery, (they eventually took over a small surgery that NHS England had closed)  my GP is pretty good. Our practice covers something like 18k patients, so yes, now and again mistakes happen.  Hugs xxx",

It\u2019s quite a lovely story, a number of years ago the RSPB released some sick and injured swans onto the small lake there and only one survived. He (we know that now!) has one very badly deformed leg and is not often far from the water. A couple of years ago another almost fully white swan joined him, she still had some grey feathers, but stayed. They chased off each Canada goose that tried to settle (there\u2019s a small island) but tolerate the ducks, coot and moorhens, even the visiting heron. Then late last spring suddenly she had 4 wee fluffy fuzz balls in tow! And proved a brilliant mum, but one went early on (not sure how) and one later, by local foxes as one of the security chaps found the remains.  But the two still changing their feathers have stayed as if there\u2019s enough food the adults don\u2019t chase them off.  Hoping for more this year as I\u2019ve seen the adults posing to each other!

Before I had my kids (now 40 and 42) the mantra was to employ half of all school leavers to keep the NHS fully staffed. Did it happen? No, of course not!  But it's the only one we have, we need to look after it and use it wisely (which I do, but see it mis-used and abused so much)  Hugs xxx",

I used to walk a lot more than I do now, with hubs, but as he\u2019s now disabled it\u2019s more tricky.

I guess the council seldom bothers with drain clearing any longer, so many simply overflow.  So as it\u2019s a bank holiday I\u2019m staying in and doing some laundry!  Hugs xxx",

Hi Seaspirit,  Having your hair done in lovely colours sounds wonderful!  Me? I showed signs of going grey when aged 30, I waited till 50 to let it be all natural, my hairdresser had helped by getting it longer, low lighting a couple of times, and then when the time was right and hair the right length, cutting very short and stylish, went into work the following day, one of my colleagues shrieked 'you went grey overnight?'  Since then it's gradually got more silvery towards white.  Hugs xxx",

Unfortunately where it crosses the canal they have obviously had a problem with the bridge so it\u2019s closed. So I had to make a detour.....thank goodness I left plenty of time as I still made it with about 6 minutes to spare! (Hate being late!) so after a rehearsal stood on my feet it was another walk home!

However, as for the speedy recovery, don\u2019t forget I was a therapist so rehab comes very naturally to me, and I felt horrified when I was so weak, I worked hard at walking to build up stamina again, first walk (a long one so soon after the op) was to get out of the ward!!!  But, again, it has to be your decision!  Hugs xxx ",

Whenever I was able to travel there was too much in the way of troubles!  Not much walking today unless you count the supermarket shop?!  However, I did learn all about oiling and greasing the Bombe machine, so it was heads inside the back to see the oil slots!  As for watching sports, it\u2019s just tennis I\u2019m afraid, so this fortnight is all I watch (Wimbledon!) had tickets couple of years ago and paid to get into Centre on \u2018hand backs\u2019 just as Andy was starting his match, excellent seats too!  Hugs xxx",

A treat didn\u2019t work, crossing the road didn\u2019t work, but then a diversion of another dog to bark at took his mind off it and we continued! Daft dog!  Much cooler but a refreshing breeze. i managed to get all hubs\u2019 prescriptions and picked them up from the chemist, too. So we are all ready!  Lots of organising and packing to do once we are dog-less, lots easier without him insisting on getting in the way, bless him, or charging up and downstairs with us!  Hugs xxx",

So good to hear. Today all the walking I did was the full length of Bletchley Park and back at some speed, but I did stand much of the day anyway.

I missed yoga this morning due to the appointment but bless her, my teacher says she\u2019s one less tomorrow evening and I can go then instead!  Hugs xxx",

Probably did 4-5 miles I guess.  On the edge of the village we\u2019re thd ruins of a Carmellite Friary, I stopped for a drink from my water bottle, that was the only brief stop apart from map checks!  Pic below if it will post.... hugs xxx",

I wear socks at the moment but in summer months bare feet. You\u2019ll need a yoga mat too. Some folk use a hard foam head block but I just take a small firm cushion.

      "Content": "Hi Sideways,  I had my mastectomy last April, had to have the op repeated 30 hours later due to haematoma developing. I still had quite a long walk out of the ward to the car the following day. I slept lots and rested lots, still pottered around home, but began very short walks outside about a week later, first of all \u2018round the block\u2019 then gradually further.  If you plan circular walks you can get home quickly if you find it too far. And remember that the anaesthetic takes a few weeks to fully leave your system, so feeling a bit wobbly is possibly that. But walking is a really good stamina building exercise post op, going further as and when you feel able. My walks are regularly 2 miles plus, sometimes further out into the country. Now that I\u2019m well healed I often use trekking poles to help my leg joints, but I am 73!   Hope all goes well  hugs xxx",

I\u2019m only thankful that the cyclist hit me and not the old chap walking towards me, as I\u2019m pretty sure the old chap would have fallen as a result. (Not that I\u2019m that young at 73!)  I\u2019m still pretty cross, but thankful I wasn\u2019t knocked over, these old fragile bones might not have survived. Oh, and said cyclist disappeared faster than he appeared, no way would he have been able to stop to find out if I was ok, he was going too fast to stop! What is worse, is the thought that at that speed he could have easily knocked someone over and badly hurt them!  Hugs xxx",

I'm fine, it's good to look down and see a 'bump' there when first waking. It is no way the same as the other one, I'm a bit old (73) and the other one drifts south with gravity. But in a bra (slightly padded) they look the same, twins. Otherwise they are definitely sisters!  And of course I do have a cleavage. The sensation is very odd, some parts feel relatively normal, some totally numb. I also have a slightly 'flat' spot to the left side where the two scars which got joined were pulled together a bit more than the rest, (have a small prosthesis to pop in a non padded bra)  will ask about that in my appointment (hard to imagine it's almost 3months now) in mid-July. I might also ask about hoiking the other one up a bit....not sure if they can or if it's really advised either.  Hugs xxx",

He can walk around the house and potter in the garden (he loves growing things to eat!) but uses a wheelchair further afield. That means the sort of walks we enjoyed together aren't available to him. And I feel I dare not to risk needing to be rescued, too! But I do usually manage a few miles each week.  Hugs xxx",

Light clothing in layers, and the same with bedding really, you sort of get used to the \u2018on/off\u2019 routine. its got worse again for some of us as the medication reduces oestrogen even more for those of us with cancers that are affected by it. I\u2019m thankful for that medication as it will hopefully keep me free now but it was hard work last hot spell when it had just got into my system.  A hand held rechargeable fan helps lots too, I\u2019ve found, and that doesn\u2019t impinge on anyone else much.

I know it rhymes etc but having seen daughter lose her hair three times, the last possibly to lose her life too,(she didn't) as a result of treatment (a good third of patients undergoing a bone marrow transplant do not survive the first month) I've found I had to switch off whenever that advert showed.  I admire people like my good friend who have done this in the right way, realising it does in no way compare with treatment for cancer, and being filmed saying so. But for me, I think the adverts I have seen attempt to trivialise hair loss from chemo.  I wish it could be shown in a more sympathetic manner, not the laughing and joking in the advert. And maybe Macmillan could search a rhyming dictionary to replace the word 'brave' as although it's cold, odd and is lasting for a while, I still don't think the act of shaving is brave.  However, hugs to all who do it IN THE RIGHT SPIRIT and raise money.  And bigger hugs to all who are affected xxx",

I\u2019m on many other meds too, including bispohosphanates (alendronic acid) and experiences joint and bone pain when I started that. I tackled that in a slightly different way, knowing that joint and bone pain with G-CSF gets treated successfully by lymphoma patients in the USA, by the antihistamine Claritin together with regular paracetamol, I gave it a try, and it helped. I had been used to walking several miles for pleasure, had been reduced to having pain walking out to the bus at the end of the road!  I carried on for 3 months gradually finding I could get back to walking for pleasure, and then ran out for 3 weeks, the pain increased so went back on them.  I had been off all non needed meds for a couple of weeks with the mx, but began the Claritin (generic Loratidine) the night before I began Letrozole and my fingers are crossed that it helps!  Just a bit of an idea!  Hugs xxx",

They use it in the USA for bone and joint pain that arises with G-CSF used for white cell boosting. Nobody seems to know why or how it works, but it does help together with regular paracetamol. Might take a week or so to gradually help but I began when I started on Alendronic Acid.

Although I\u2019m now 73 I just couldn\u2019t face waking and seeing a wonky chest, and now have a decent cleavage. A longer op with a DIEP wasn\u2019t really an option as I was concerned about infection possibility though it would have been a good way to get a flatter tummy!  I was lucky in that I\u2019d had a positive-free mammogram so to be sure a SNB before my surgery, and yes my nodes were free, so no radiotherapy indicated, HER2 neg so no chemo, just  hormone-busting Letrozole as mine was OR+ Recovery pretty ok though I did have to have repeat surgery the following day as I bled therefore had blood clots to clear, even behind the implant so it was all re-done. So the first few days I did feel a bit washed out. Otherwise all good, they use glue in my unit rather than dressings so I was able to shower once home, though had to clear space on a shelf for the drains!  Hope all the stories help you in your decision, best wishes whatever you decide it has to be right for you!  Hugs xxx",

My new boob is numb in parts, but some of that is improving as the nerves grow back, it\u2019s also a bit smaller, perkier but with a flat-ish spot and no nipple, but I\u2019m reasonably ok with it.

I had little option because of site and status than to go for a mx. Fortunately we\u2019d booked a few days away and the mammogram suggested no node affected, so the surgeon decided on a SNB first then if all seemed ok a mx a few weeks later.  Somehow I just knew I wanted an implant, I had realised a reconstruction was a much bigger op and at 73 felt it wasn\u2019t really an option but I wanted to preserve a \u2018bit of a figure\u2019 if I could. Surgeon happy to help, and suggested that as the SNB came back negative too, we went for the permanent implant.  Its not bad, a bit smaller than other boob with a flat area but I\u2019m looking into whether to think about any augmentation, probably won\u2019t but want to know what\u2019s involved.

I  asked then if it could be linked, and the doc I saw then suggested it could well be a sign I was beginning menopause.  So it surely follows that Letrozole, in reducing oestrogen, can have the same effect?  Hugs xxx",

Had the blood test and within the day, result showed low levels. A prescription for high strength capsules followed, for a limited time. Then a prescription for Adcal D3, due to nausea I never managed to take the twice daily dose.  Following that, the next Dexa showed mild osteoporosis (and I had broken a wrist in a fall on ice) so got prescribed Alendronic Acid. I then found a better source of D3 and have been taking them (no nausea) dosage was checked out and advised by GP.  I will be interested in results of next Dexa, due in October. And all this was way before my bc diagnosis.  But yes, due to the winter lack of sun and our reluctance to bare flesh in the coldest months of the year (!) most people in the UK are deficient in vit D. I do try to go out with bare arms (apparently all that\u2019s needed) for 15 minutes when it\u2019s warm enough and sunny.  Hugs xxx",

My BCN did warn me that this might be the case, so I decided to stay on the Claritin (put myself on it for the aches that I got when taking Alendrobic Acid for osteoporosis) or rather, the generic form, Loratidine. I gather that sticking to the same brand of Letrozole can be helpful, I\u2019m on Accord and my pharmacy have this listed so will supply me with the same each time.ive also put myself on Glucosamine and chondroitin, with approval of my BCN.  i Have to agree, it might be the effect of the Letrozole but might \u2018just\u2019 be the reduced oestrogen levels? Who knows?  My hair thinned too but as I had very thick hair which needed regular thinning that didn\u2019t worry me overmuch. It\u2019s now a bit thicker again, so I wonder if it was the shock of having cancer and three operations within a month (my mx developed a haematoma so was re-done 30 hours later including re-doing the implant)  i too have read that similar AI\u2019s have similar side effects, it might be that swapping is like jumping out of the frying pan into the fire?! So I\u2019m sticking with it in the knowledge that it\u2019s preventing recurrence/secondary problems!  Hugs xxx",

It helped so I\u2019ve continued. I also talked to BCN about maybe adding Glucosamine and Chondroitin when I noticed aches were getting worse with lovely Letrozole (but my bc is 8/8 so I will battle on!) and ive found things did improve once my body got used to it all, plus I try and walk 2-3 miles 2-3 times a week as well.  I know it\u2019s more expense, as GP\u2019s don\u2019t prescribe these antihistamines or the G&C any more, but if it helps then I will carry on!
