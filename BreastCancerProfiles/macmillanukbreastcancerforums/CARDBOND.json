      "Content": "I saw my GP last July as I felt so drained and tired all of the time. Various blood tests done and an X-ray. Results came back that my liver function was low. I went back a few weeks later for further blood tests and all were fine. But I've not really regained my energy. I'm not one for visiting Drs and I usually just 'get on with it'! The shoulder and upper back aches have been there for ages. I just put it down to a stressful job. Obviously finding a lump at the end of Jan was abit of a 'surprise'. By next Thursday it will be 2 weeks since the biopsy was taken. I know it's easy to say I'm probably just stressed, but I'm a pretty strong person. Such a bugger having to wait....",

The nurse said to expect a letter within 2 weeks, but they won't meet to discuss the findings until this tues coming (2 days time). I'm not being negative in thinking I do feel it'll be a BC diagnosis.  I've not been myself for a very long time. I'm self employed and 'just get on with things'. Long hours do leave my energy levels low, but I really haven't felt right for a very long time. At least I'm going into this being informed and bracing myself....if it's good news then blooming marvellous. If it's not; well I'll on it as a challenge....And I will be somewhat ready to embrace it. Critical illness cover will be the next challange! Being self employed is a bugger, and I know they don't pay out for 'in situ'!",
