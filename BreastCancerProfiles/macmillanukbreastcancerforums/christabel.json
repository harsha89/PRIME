    "Content": "I have a family history of loads of different types of cancer and have just seen a genetic counsellor who wants to test me for Li-Fraumeni Syndrome. Do I want to know or not? If I know that I am more at risk (or worst still, my children are more at risk) of different cancers, can I live with that easily? Or is ignorance bliss in this case? I have asked myself these questions and decided that I need to know the truth one way or another. If I have this horrible syndrome, then at least if I do have a problem, my gp will take me seriously and not try to fob me off!",
