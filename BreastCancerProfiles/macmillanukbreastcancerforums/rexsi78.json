    "Content": "Hi all, Looking for some support and guidance from anyone who has experienced cancer whilst being single.  Whilst I have an amazing network of friends and family, I just feel it is not the same when you\u2019re single and even more so when darkness falls and it\u2019s time to go to the land of nod...I struggle the most when it comes to bedtime. How do you stay strong when dealing with it alone..? Thanks ",
