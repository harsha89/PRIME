      "Content": "Hello all, Many thanks for all your comments. The latest is that we had the results clinic meeting last Thursday and were told that after their MDT meeting the oncologist recommends trying chemotherapy first, monitoring the tumour is reducing and then look again! That meeting is on Friday this week.There was the option that if we didn't want the chemo we could go back to the surgery. All of this is substantially different from our first meeting 8th March when we were told it's a very small growth of 8mm and \"easily curable\" (and he did say curable). It was at our meeting 22nd March that we were told by the consultant we would be in within weeks as soon as there was a space on his list. My wife's reaction is that we are being \"fobbed off\" and doing nothing because she is too old at 67 for them to bother. Unfortunately, anything I say is wrong and one moment she is ok and the next someone (or the papers) says something and she's down again. Any ideas people?",

      "Content": "Good morning all, My wife and I go back to breast clinic Thursday morning to receive results from numerous biopsies and be informed of the treatment plan for the initial diagnosis of Grade2, ductal NST, ER8, PR6, HER2- BC. We haven't yet received the results from the later 12 or so biopsies, but she is now convinced she has advanced breast cancer (usual internet searches and newspaper reports I'm afraid). No matter what I say of course it's the wrong thing-anyone have any ideas on how to deal with the wait?",
