    "Content": "Hiya..I'm new to the forum (was diagnosed last Oct but only joined yesterday!)..so I'm not 100% sure what TRAM/DIEP is..but I may have a bit of an alternative idea for you. I had a lumpectomy and axillary node clearance last Oct..and just had my last chemo last monday. Hooray for that! I'm having a double mastectomy and reconstruction at the same time in a few weeks. I'm quite petite too..5 ft 2 and size 10/12. My surgeon said I didn't have enough spare fat for a traditional type mastectomy so he's doing a new procedure. They use pig skin stripped of all its DNA and protein so the body doesn't reject it. They cut out all the breast tissue and nipple..the cut goes beneath the boob not across it. Then they use the pig skin..called Strattice..and make a sling/hammock out of it, and they put an implant inside it. The Strattice acts as a support for the implant meaning there's no need to use muscle and fat from your own body. The op takes 3 to 4 hours and has a 2 to 3 week recovery. Much better than a trad mastectomy. You should mention this to your surgeon..they might not do it but they might know someone who does! Good luck with everything :-) xx",
