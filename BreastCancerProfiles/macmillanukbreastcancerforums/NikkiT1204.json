      "Content": "Morning lovely ladies  So had my WLE 2 weeks ago yesterday All went well , revovering quite well, although surprised by how tired I am I went for my follow up and results on Wednesday  and have my head has been spinning ever since. All the tumor was removed with clear margins, larger than they originally thought but still only grade 1 thankfully. BUT it was in both of the lymph nodes they removed. The surgeon was as surprised as we were. I had had a microbubble test to the lymph nodes,  MRI and miltiple ultrasounds prior to surgery which had shown no indication. The MDT have said that there is no real benefit in removing more nodes , rads and hormone should deal with anything left.  My concern is it was in both nodes they removed, what if its in more? There was only a tiny amount in the second node, so they are saying it should be fine. I dont really want should , i want will be!!  They have said I can have node clearance if I want it , but obvioulsy that has its own risks. I dont know what to think, if they'd taken 3 nodes and it had come back as tiny in 2nd and none in 3rd I'd be more inclined to leave them . But they didn't expect it to be in the nodes at all  what if there is more. Will rads and hormone therapy be enough? Oh lordy what a mind muddle. I am meeting with the oncologist on Wednesday, so hopefully she may be able to give a bit more clarity but if any of you wonderful ladies here have had similar situations I would welcome your thoughts Sendings hugs and positive love to you all on this chilly morning And thank you for being there when the rest of the world is asleep Nikki xx",

      "Content": "Thank you Ruby Rose for replying so swiftly x Thanks for that info. I did email my Macmillan nurse who has said wait and speak with Oncologist.  Its just a long time till Wednesday I'm hoping to go back to work on Monday but this is just really bringing me down. I work in hospitality so have to be able to put my \" I'm doing fine\" face on!!! I just wish I had a magic wand to give me all the answers. I will try and call this morning, although actually talking to someone is so much harder than writing it down .You can wipe your tears away and carry on writing on here. Not so easy on the phone ( I also know none of my family can hear my thoughts on here #braveface #ofcourseimok!) Thanks Ruby Rose  Hope you are doing ok on  your journey xx I hope one day soon to be able to offer advice rather than asking for it  xx",
