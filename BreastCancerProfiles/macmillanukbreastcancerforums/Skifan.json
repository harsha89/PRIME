    "Content": "Hi DL, By any chance are you using a mouthwash to help prevent mouth ulcers? I had an allergic reaction to mouthwash containing chlorhexidine;  I had a white tongue and gums - the whole inside of my mouth started peeling - though I did not get a sore throat. It cleared up within a day of stopping that particular mouthwash. It was my dentist who identified the allergy to the mouthwash. I also found BMX mouthwash (it is made up on prescription) excellent for numbing the pain and clearing up mouth ulcers. I had problems with my nails while on my first chemo (TCH) regime almost 7 years ago. I have used cold therapy gloves and slippers which are frozen before wearing during and shortly after each infusion; while I still get some nail damage it has certainly been minimised by the gloves. It reduces the circulation to hands and feet helping to reduce the amount of chemo reaching those points. So far I've not experienced the pins and needles that can result in your hands and feet from the chemo and I feel that the gloves and slippers have helped with this too.  Wishing you all the very best with your treatment.",
