      "Content": "Hi Lorna, Thank you for your reply and I think the Macmillan website is a really good source of sensible info. Last week, I was at home and keeping busy doing short distracting jobs , nothing strenuous, but this weekend I've found it harder. I have been waking up in the night since that Thursday which is 10 days ago. I have been in touch with people who have any cancer success stories but it doesn't change anything. I am thinking of your Mum's appointment tomorrow and pray that you get answers to your questions. :)",
