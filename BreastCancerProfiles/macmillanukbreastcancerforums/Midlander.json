    "Content": "Thank you for posting. My wife got her biopsy results yesterday. After mastectomy - the lump was 3.5cm with precancerous cells around it. Worse was that half of the 21 lymphs removed had cancer. This has kncoked me for 6 again, just as I was starting to function again. My wife is being so strong. I'm dreading seeing the oncologist next week, who will apparently start quoting 'odds'!",
