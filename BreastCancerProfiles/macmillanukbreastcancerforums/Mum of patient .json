      "Content": "Thanks, Semh,  That is very helpful.  Have just found your message in my \u2018junk\u2019 emails!  Will have to see if I can change that!  The side effects of the TCHP were disabling first round, but her oncologist suggested lowering the doses of the T and C, plus less steroids, and it has been slightly better this time.  Daughter has an ultrasound appointment today so here\u2019s hoping for shrinkage!  Best Wishes for your surgery.

      "Content": "Thanks, Sparkle.  Is 81 your birth year? If so, that\u2019s the same as our daughter.  It seems there are a LOT of young women going through treatment at the moment, I wonder if anyone has done any research as to why?!  Did you have radiotherapy, too?  If so, what was the timing for that?  Daughter\u2019s reviews are with her oncologist rather than her surgeon at the moment.  Ultrasound today, hoping for shrinkage.  All the best!  X ",

      "Content": "Hi Sparkle 81,  How is your radiotherapy going?  Lots of travel for you!  DD now has her wig, which she has already worn on a few occasions, so that\u2019s a success.      Unfortunately she was unable to have her chemo treatment last week as she had a fever,  both her little ones have been poorly, so she is currently staying with us in the hope of being ok for chemo tomorrow.  So hard to have to leave them when they are poorly!  Hope you are nearing the end of radiotherapy now.  Best Wishes  S",

      "Content": "Hi Sparkle,  thanks for your messages.  Daughters tumour has definitely started to shrink ( review with oncologist on Thursday should tell her how much) so hopefully that and the sunshine will lift her spirits.   It\u2019s especially hard not being able to do things with her little ones in half term week, and the hair loss despite cold cap isn\u2019t helping!  I am trying to get her an appointment with \u2018my new hair\u2019 for next week to get some advice on wigs.  Good luck with your radiotherapy, how many do you have to do?  Xx",
