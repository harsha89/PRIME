    "Content": " I didn't have breast cancer but I saw your post wanting positive thinking. I had testicular cancer at 30, I am now 52 and have a 19yr old son. I was scared every time I went for a check up or scan for years My mother got leukaemia along with a lung infection cant remember the name its long but she has to clear her lungs 3 times a day. she's still going strong over 15yrs later. I know its not what you asked for but its all positive. Take care.  ",
