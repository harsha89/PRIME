      "Content": "Just been to doctors Last few weeks had weird sensation all over my chest and breast, if I stroke my breast on the inner side it's highly tender. Doctors face when she touched it was straight away nervous and she said straight away we need to get it seen at the breast clinic as soon as possible for a scan and likely bio.  I'm 31 with a 20 wk old and a 8 year old. Single mum and I'm so worried. Please can I have some guidance on what happens and what to do. Thank you xx",

      "Content": "Hi Cathy  Thank you for that message. I think everyday about everyone who is affected by cancer and now I have to get the tests it's obviously made me worry. I was breast feeding but I have had to stop due to my princess having so many allergies bless her, I ended up eating little meat and just fruit and veg.  My sister passed away at 25 bless her. Hence I'm scared now. Everyone on this site is so brave and strong. I knew if I put a post up someone could give me a bit of strength to not panick and not look at Google. It was only yesterday my son and I booked our race for life 5k then I got told this today so bit scary. Thank you for you message  Jodie x",
