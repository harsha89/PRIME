      "Content": "Hi All, Thank you all so much for your kind thoughts and words as it really means a lot. The news from the doctors/consultants was not good yesterday. Me and my partner already knew that she had cancer of the breast but we were told that it had gone to the lymph nodes too. They are giving my partner a CT scan on sunday then we will have a meeting on tuesday when we will know if the cancer has spread further. Doctors were brutal but honest and told us that if the CT scan showed the cancer had spread then they would just do the chemo and radiotherapy and not do surgery. Neither us left yesterday feeling hopeful at all, and are now fearing the worst when we attend the meeting on tuesday. As it stands at this point my partner will start chemo at the beginning of August. But with the words from the doctors saying the cancer was very aggressive, we are not looking to the future just living day by day.",

      "Content": "Hi all, Sorry not been on for a while. Me and my partner went to get a plan of treatment last Tuesday and they have told us that she will start chemo beginning of august and then radiotherapy and then to have a full masectomy so a long and gruelling 18 months ahead. Just wondering if any people on here have had a masectomy and chosen NOT to have reconstructive surgery?",

      "Content": "Morning everyone, My girlfriend has just been diagnosed with Breast Cancer(last thursday) and we have to go back this thursday for what is going to happen next. My partners scan showed a mass on her left breast and we were told that it had been there 10 to 12 months minimum. What really annoyed me was one of the female doctors asked my partner quite joyfully \"has everything gone ok?\" and when my partner said no she replied joyfully \"oh well\". The thing is we don't know whether we should fear the worst and be relieved or hope for the best and then be devastated. It's very difficult because both me and my partner have families we are not close at all so we have decided not to tell them anything until we know for definite. My partner also suffers from chronic depression and is automatically fearing that is terminal due to the length of time the mass has been in her breast before, but more worryingly, my partner checks her breasts every day as her mum had breast cancer(she survived without losing her breasts) but felt nothing wrong. I guess what I'm really asking is how other people here went into a room to hear about their results. I would assume most people would be positive.",
