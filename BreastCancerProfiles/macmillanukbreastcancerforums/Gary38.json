      "Content": "Hi Poet40, Of course each and every one of us can choose what we eat and/or drink. Personally if I'm making a choice with a specific goal in mind then I like to base that choice upon evidence. So, with regard to green tea, water from a reverse osmosis system, selenium, etc, please state what the intended aim is of each of these, and then point me to ANY independent, scientific, double-blind, statistically sound, repeatable, peer-reviewed trials that demonstrate that these are effective for your condition. I really do have an open mind on this, but in the absence of evidence, I'm not inclined to pay good money for something just because someone I don't know thinks \"it is suggested\" and \"there might be a good case\". Such things count for nothing But remember, by \"evidence\" I mean that such trials would have to demonstrate: 1) that the effects ACTUALLY took place (i.e. they're not made up) 2) that the people would not have improved anyway (i.e. it wasn't a coincidence) 3) that the alternative remedy hadn't slowed down or made worse the situation (i.e. some conventional medicines have a cumulative effect and they might have worked quicker without the alternative medicine) Finally, I have flagged your post as it has a link to a site that promotes alternative therapies and that's against the house rules. I look forward to the seeing the evidence. Thanks Gary ------------------------------ \"One step at a time\"",

      "Content": "Hi, I have read both of your posts several times, and my post was in no way meant to be antagonistic. Like you, I was stating my personal preferences - i.e. before I would embark upon such approaches I would want to see some evidence supporting their effectiveness. As you imply, there are hundreds of \"remedies\" out there, and without evidence I could be wasting my money, or I could be doing actual harm. Why would I take that risk? Also, I noted the careful way that you had worded your post. And I would not have flagged it had it not contained a link to a site that promotes alternative therapies. Please let me know where else this site is referenced and I shall flag those too. Tricia, I hope there is no upset here. It's simply people with different views having a conversation, debating facts and opinions. Just because we disgree doesn't mean that we aren't supportive friends. It's okay to disagree. I understand people wanting to try all sorts to help come up with a cure. But I'm not going to give my 24 year-old daughter (with bowel cancer and liver mets) anything that hasn't been proven to be beneficial. I truly hope and pray that you will be \"in perfect health after a few months\" BUT I'd also like to KNOW what caused it. I'm sure that your diet will have its merits but (and please let me use a simple example to illustrate a point) if you take green tea during this time then how would we know whether you would have got better anyway without it - after all thousands of people with your condition might drink green tea and never get better. So, I'm not knocking folk taking and promoting whatever they want (unless it's as an alternative to established medicine, and I know that yours is not, Tricia). But I'm simply saying that for me to consider giving it to my daughter, I'd want to see the evidence first. Thanks for allowing me to clarify my position - please continue to challenge my posts if you disagree with them. I'm genuinely open to persuasion. Thanks Gary ------------------------------ \"One step at a time\"",

      "Content": "Noj, Really please for you. By the way, our daughter had hers fitted last week, and they used it for her first chemo on the same day (with 1 night overnight stay to check it was all okay). Perhaps you could ask in advance whether your hospital could do the same? Gary ------------------------------ \"One step at a time\"",
