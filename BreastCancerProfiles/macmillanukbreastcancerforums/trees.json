    "Content": "Hi everyone, I hope someone can help me please? My mum hadÂ lumpectomy and also had some underarm lymph nodes removed for testing yesterday at tea time. Last night we noticed swelling started under mum's arm. The nurse phoned the doctor and we were told a doctor would call out today to have a look. A junior doctor came to look and said she couldn't see any lump or swelling! The cut they made under the arm was hanging below mum's breast, it had swollen that much. I told her this pointed to the lump also. She still couldn't see it so I asked her to look at mum's other breast and compare it. Once she looked she said she couldn't go home and said she would phone the senior doctor and ask if mum can be put on antibiotics in case it is infected! The swelling is now all under the arm, around her side and going half way around her back and bright and dark red all over. It looks like it is going down in her hand and her fingers are going tight. The lump has severe swelling and there is no senior doctor to look until Monday and I am so worried and disgusted the way my mum is being treated :( I pray no one else has to go through this.",
