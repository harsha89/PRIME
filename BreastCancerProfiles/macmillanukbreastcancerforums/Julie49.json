    "Content": "Hi ! I was diagnosed double breast cancer late last year. I've had the chemo and 2 months ago had bilateral mastectomy and Diep reconstruction all in the same operation. As I didn't have enough stomach fat I had implants fitted too. Now since surgery my new breasts have always felt warm and sometimes even hot! When I mentioned this to my surgeon today, they gave me a blank look and couldn't explain why that was? Can anyone tell me if they've experienced the 'heat' and if so does it calm down or does it mean there is possibly a problem? ThanksÂ ",
