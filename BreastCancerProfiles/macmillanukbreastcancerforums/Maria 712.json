      "Content": "Hi Ruthie I had that decision to make yesterday and decided to go with the chemo . The way it was explained to me was that there were 3 groups of cancer results  then ones that had a 1% chance of it coming back then the middle group who had a 10% chance of it coming back then the high risk group who had 20% chance of it coming back . I am in the middle group  my thoughts are I have young kids and a amazing husband and I want to be around to spend the rest of my life with them .Yes it may well be a rough 6 months for me but at least I know I have done everything I can to make sure I am here for as long as possible. I know for some its a difficult decision but for me it was a no brainer , I feel that with how much chemo must cost the nhs they wouldn't offer it to people it they didn't feel it was necessary . Good luck with your decision I hope you make the right one for yourself Maria x ",

Stupid question but am I now not classed as a cancer patient as the lump has been removed , have been told I still need to do the 18 chemo sessions etc but if its been taken out surely the plans will be changed wont they ???  Or am I just being a stupid arse ???

This waiting for the next results is just  driving me crazy everytime I open my eyes its like i'm one sleep closer to it .
