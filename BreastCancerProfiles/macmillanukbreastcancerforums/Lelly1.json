      "Content": "Ok, first idiot questions:  they've told her already its an invasive ductal lymphoma - how do they know its lymphatic in origin rather than a breast carcinoma which has spread to the lymph glands.  Or are they just being gentle with that term until they know more from the pathology? She's told me she has three lumps to be removed which I take it are either i) two breast lumps and one sentinel node or ii) one breast lump and two axillary  nodes.  Can anyone clarify this for me? Thanks again - you all know so much more than I do at this stage.",

I'll follow the advice - thanks again.",

      "Content": "Hi everybody, just to explain, I'm in a proper pickle with my emotions today as my twin told me yesterday she is going in for a lumpectomy on Thursday.  Probably looking at radiotherapy thereafter.   She is so precious to me and I feel so lost as to how to a) help her and b) help myself through this.  I'm a mess and I need to get some answers as soon as I can - I'm one of those who needs as much information as possible to help me cope. If there is somewhere else I should be posting, please let me know.  Don't want anyone to feel uncomfortable. Thanks for any replies.",
