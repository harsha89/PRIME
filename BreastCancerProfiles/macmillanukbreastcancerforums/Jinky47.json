      "Content": "Hello. I am new to this site. I am from Houston, Tx. I have browsed many breast cancer forums and I like his a lot. So here I am. In May of 2017, I was diagnosed with stage 3b IDC grade 3 with Mets to lymph. I have completed my chemo (Taxol, adriamycin, cytoxan). I also had surgery in January. Bilateral mastectomy with lymph removal (7), and immediate first stage reconstruction. I am currently doing my radiation. I have done 5 and have 25 to go. I do it Monday-Friday and have he weekends off. I am 47 years old. Recently divorced. I have a 5 year old daughter and a 9 year old son. Also, when hurricane Harvey hit, we lost everything. Doing this cancer fight without a partner has been so hard. My ex husband was unfaithful so I couldn\u2019t lean on him even after divorce that was finalized during my chemo. My children live with me. We are with my parents, whom also lost their home and everything in it. We are living in the home while it is being renovated. Trying to deal with all the loss and emotionally support my children (divorce, my cancer, losing all our belongings) has been exhausting. However, we are well. We stick together very tightly and pray a lot. I responded well to the chemo. Out of the 7 nodes removed, zero had cancer. Chemo did that. When I was diagnosed and spoke with a good friend that was 2 years out from IBC, she said my mental and emotional health was up to me and I must tend to that and get plenty of rest. That has not happened, but I am still able to press on and look forward to a new future. We will be starting from scratch. I have been a registered nurse and worked in pediatrics for 26 years. I don\u2019t receive child support (didn\u2019t want anything from him). We will be fine. It\u2019s almost as if we get to do things over and this time, I will make better choices and be so much more mindful of everything. One of those is the fact that I could get sick again. It\u2019s a haunt that is always on the tail end of every thought or plan I make. That terrifies me. I have a gene mutation called \u201cchek2\u201d that is of Eastern European decent. It doubled my risk of breast cancer. Not enough is known about to know what to expect in the future. My cancer is ER+, PR+, HER2 - . I will be taking medication for 5 -10 years after I complete the radiation. I know I have rambled through this introduction. Thanks for reading. ❤️",
