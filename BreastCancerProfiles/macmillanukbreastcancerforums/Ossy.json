I lost my breast but the cancer didn't spread so why I'm I feeling like a complete failure. Is it the  hormones ..I don't sleep and the sweats are driving me insane still having sickness off an on but I've been holding it together until now. I only have my husband who's been my rock. I can't  talk to family their all so busy with there own lives and aren't really interested they never even came to see me in hospital.  Can't tell friends cos they all think I'm great an so brave ..Am I just dwelling in self pity..I feel lost is this normal I mean have you guys felt like this .thanks",
