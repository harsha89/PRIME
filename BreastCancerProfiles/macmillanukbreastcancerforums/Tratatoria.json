After 3 x3weekly EC I'm now on 4/9 taxol & my head of hair is starting to regrow but v fuzzy & soft. My eyebrows & eyelashes are all slowly giving up the 'comfort' of my body but chinhair (that was being electrolyised into submission preBC has been continuing to reemerge - truly thought that wud see the sense & stop for a while. Have debated making a feature of them... - but my make up skills aren't that good & haven't done my 'look better' day yet; or along with wearing a buff on my head I could wear Over my chinney chin chin ...  well the pubes are long gone still not reemerging yet so I could rock a If it wasn't so cold, I hadn't been ingesting so many steroids & if my picc line was pink to match.  Hang in there everyone there's light at the end of the tunnel x",

When having my 3weekly ec & 9 x t I aimed to stink 3li the day before & day of treatment then abt 2li ish on a normal day. I found the only time I didn't do the 3li I felt terrible so do think it helps yo combat that dehydrated/chemo hangover. I aim at the pint glass approach st each meal. And then weakened fruit juice or squash to help get the intake up. Plus limited myself to only 2 large cups of coffee (or tea) each day.  My body seemed to need the loo a lot in the beginning but then it seems to stabilise.  Good luck you won't turn into a   Or   Xx",

As a family we named my lump 'Bob'; any Lil tumor cells that may have escaped 'Bobbettes'; DCIS - embryonic Bobs & then when I was told I'd need a mastectomy (not at all what I expected) we named it Racquel (after kenny Everett sketch). As a family it meant we could discuss the whole thing any where at any time (my children are 16yr girl & 13 yr boy).  My advice be kind to yourself this weekend. These forums are great for picking up lots of useful advice. Good luck for Monday.  X",

I had a fairly swift reaction to epirubicin (they said that was v unusually). They dealt with it very calmly & v proactively. Lots of antihistamine. They tried to improve any se I had from ulcers to upset stomachs to dressings covering my picc line. Then changed my docetaxel to pacletaxel to be easier/kinder to my body. Just speak to the nurses & your oncol.  Food allergies are a nightmare at the best of times (both my children have medically confirmed different alkergies) & the chemo does affect the digestive tract I still have to avoid dairy so just take it steady & see where you get to.  Good luck, the time will pass but pace yourself.  X",
