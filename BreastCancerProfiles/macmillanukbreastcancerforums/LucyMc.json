    "Content": "Hi all - I\u2019m new to this forum so please excuse my lack of knowledge / lingo!  A cancerous tumour was found in my mums breast during a routine mammogram - she had a successful lumpectomy with no indicators that it had spread further - which is great news. However, the cancer was HER2 + so she starts 14 weekly sessions if taxol next Thursday, and 1 years worth of 3 weekly herceptin injection and 3 weeks radiotherapy. I\u2019m really just looking for any help / advice / experiences from others so I can help her as much as poss. As with most I imagine, she is anxious about potentially losing her hair but is unsure about using a cold cap - does anyone have any comments on the hair loss thing with weekly taxol? Any hair care suggestions? Also - any info about the other side-effects?  Thanks in advance for any comments - they\u2019ll be greatly appreciated. i appreciate that although my mum has a \u2018testing\u2019 few months ahead she is very lucky to have such an early diagnosis. Sending love and best wishes to you all x ",
