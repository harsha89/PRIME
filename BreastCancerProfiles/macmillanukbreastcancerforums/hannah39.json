      "Content": "Well things really dont seem to be happening as I, and my consultant expected. I went back on the 2nd to be told that the lump was twice the size than they originally thought, although they still managed to get clear margins so thats good. I have to go and get a full body scan today and Im back in on friday for a full node clearance. Chemo is definately on the cards now so will be starting this soon after. Im dreading the second op as im still feeling very sore under my arm from the node removal before and am now on antibiotics to try and reduce the swelling before friday.  Im getting pain on my right hand side below my ribs so fingers crossed the scan comes back clear but Im not banking on it now.",

      "Content": "Hi All Well the op went well and i got home at around 7 the same day. I was a bit disappointed as the whole experience wasnt the best. I was in recovery for over 3 hours as there was no bed and i was discharged without so much as a word from the consultant so I still dont know how it went. Apparently they pierced my implant, but its still there so Im guessing it wasnt bad enough for them to take it out. I only saw this as they left my notes on my bed and had a quick peek. I had to get someone to explain but she couldnt tell me much really. Still, Im not in pain, just some discomfort but thats ok and i still have full mobility of my arm. Had 4 nodes removed. Next appointment is on the 2nd Feb. Oldhat - Im sorry i cant explain about the fatty lumps, just that my mammogram alone wouldnt have alerted them to anything serious, maybe your breast nurse will be able to explain more. I dont know if it was because they couldnt squash my breast properly because of the implants or because it didnt look suspicious. Best to reassure yourself though and speak to someone if youre feeling that something isnt quite right. I hope everyone is doing ok  ",

      "Content": "Crikey, where do you start? I found this site to look up information regarding one of my employees, who was diagnosed with breast cancer last year. I wanted to support and help her through her journey as best I could, with at least some knowledge of what she has been going through. Seeing everyones highs and lows here, their bravery and support for others humbled me, but also gave me hope that she would be around for a long while yet. Shes doing fine. Fast forward a year, I now find myself in the very same place that she was in a year ago, waiting to find out if its my turn to have my world turned upside down. My lovely rosey world with my husband of 6 days, and his 2 children who live with us, who i love like my own. I didnt feel a lump, just saw a puckering by my nipple when i was lifting a top over my head, and if my husband to be at the time had not seen it too I probably wouldnt have even bothered to see my GP. I had implants about 10 years ago and as the years have gone by they have developed scar tissue around them so have been used to lumps and bumps appearing over time. This was different, so off I trotted to the surgery and within 4 days was sitting in a waiting room at Bournemouth hospital on the eve of my wedding, with coutless others, all sharing the same look of disbelief and shock on our faces. So, now, a week after the scans and biopsies, still feeling battered and bruised, I find out later today if Im to tread the same road that so many of you are currently walking down. I just hope that i can do it with the same dignity and bravery that you all seem to have. Its funny how i feel, not scared or sad, just an odd feeling of resignation, and  if it is bad news Im just going to have to get on and deal with it. Either way, I will be having one or 4 brandies tomorrow night on new years eve to comiserate or (fingers crossed) celebrate. Just had a laugh to myself, its taken me so long to type this that the heading should now be..'in 3 hours I'll know!",

      "Content": "I visited the breast nurse on friday and she did in fact answer most of the questions that i wrote down before i even asked them. I came away feeling pretty ok..ish. One thing she did say is that if I had just had a mammogram they would have sent me away again, saying everything is ok, just fatty tissue. I dont know whether this is good only in the fact that the lump is only just on the 'turn' so to speak and has been caught early enough, or bad that they would have sent me away thinking that everything is ok. Quite scary really! The nurse didnt have the grading or whether it is hormone positive, she said that they sometimes cant tell straight away so I guess i will have to wait until they look at the lump on friday once its out. I must say that I find this the most frustrating bit, not knowing what treatment is going to be, I like to know whats going on! I hope everyone is doing ok, take care x ",

      "Content": "Well I finally got in touch with my breast nurse today and she explained everything to me, and I actually remembered all my questions for  change. My scan has come back clear, thank goodness. My lump was a grade two and Im ER & PR + moderate to strong and HER2 -. Im told this is positive news so Im happier now. So tomorrow I go in to have a WLI and next month start chemo. Now that I know what is involved I just want to get on with it. June Elaine, it sounds like our stories arent that different really, youre just a few months ahead of me. You also sound very matter of fact and i like that, actually everyone here seems so strong and now that i know what lies ahead I hope to be too. Everyone tells me Im brave and strong so I'll just need to have that belief in myself now!",

      "Content": "Hi Everyone Thank you for your kind words, they are much appreciated. Unfortunately it wasnt good news, I do have breast cancer. There is however some good news. I go into hospital next  friday for sentinal node biopsy and wide local excision but the consultant is confident that it hasnt spread into my lymph nodes and I will just have the little bugger out. He said he will be able to save the implant but I told him to whip the whole lot away if he needs to. He doesnt think I'll need chemo, just a few blasts of RT after.   Weve had our cry but now its time to be strong and get through this and just keep everything crossed. So there we go, I am in your gang, thank you again for your words x",

      "Content": "Thank you hat, I know that today has just been one of my low days, usually Im strong, but I think the thought of what news the scan will bring is quite a scary prospect. Like you say, probably nothing but it just seems that all the news has not be be expected so far so I think Im trying to prepare myself just in case. Its also the lack of knowledge too, Ive not been told a great deal and whenever i ring the hospital its voicemail. Im sure when Ive spoken to someone I'll feel a bit more 'in control'. Thank you xx ",
