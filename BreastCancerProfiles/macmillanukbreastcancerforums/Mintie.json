Definitely something to read/keep you occupied and a snack for the waiting room - even at 9am there might be a delay!  Drink, drink and drink some more during your chemo and keep to small meals/snacks after.  ",

      "Content": "Help! :) I'm due to meet with my surgeon in a few weeks, and I'm confused as to all the reconstruction options... a general web search hasn't helped - so I'm hoping someone around here has had a similar experience they can share? About me: I'm 5'4\", weight 48kg and ALREADY have breast implants.  So the usual \"here are the options\" type info isn't helping me.  It seems clear that the 'flap' type operations are out (I'm just too thin) and I have very little natural breast tissue (that's why I got the boob job in the first place). I'm unsure about putting an implant under the muscle (I have 'over' implants now) but I really don't want to go back to having small boobs! :(  I know, that's really vain - but I'd prefer 1 great boob, to 2 smaller ones :(  (yes, I am a bad person).   From what I've read so far, under-muscle implant seems the only way, but I have no idea if a new breast to match the other one (large, but not outlandish) is even possible when I'll have no breast tissue at all.... :( Anyone else been through this with existing implants? I know, in the grand scheme of what I'm going through, this is small-fry.  But I'd like to understand all the options before I see the surgeon.  ",
