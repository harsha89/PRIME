      "Content": "Hi Justlittleme I had a lumpectomy and slb on November 11th. I was given the result upon waking - pleased and very relieved it was clear. The blue dye, which was given the morning of the op, had the effect of making my face rather grey and I looked as though I had bags under my eyes. But it passed within hours (my best friend had rushed over to see me looking like a smurf but was sadly disappointed) However, my pee was blue for a day or two afterwards. It took some time for the blue dye to start to fade from my breast and there is still some left (blue tit!).  The nurse told me it can take up to 6 months to disappear totally.  Pain relief was handled well, they gave me local anaesthetic when the guide-wire was put in pre-op, and I understand I was given local anaesthetic in the breast before waking up. Although I was given Ibuprofen, I only needed it for the first 2 nights. Wearing a sports bra to bed is helpful.  I was very tired for the first few days. It's important not to overdo it. Driving after 2 1/2 weeks. I still don't lift anything heavy - the nurse said nothing over 5lbs - and my arm aches if I start doing too much. Listen to your body! I have been doing the exercises religiously and now have a full range of movement in my arms, though sometimes the underarm scar feels a bit stretched. The scar on my breast is fading and is not too bad  Unfortunately the scar under the arm is quite long and doesn't look great.  Hope this is helpful and wish you all the best - hugs xx Sheila Bee",

      "Content": "You have more on your plate than most people could cope with anyway, let alone your understandable worries about surgery. The tumour I had was the same size as yours, 15 mm, so my experience may set your mind at rest to some extent. The lumpectomy (11 Nov) was not as bad as I had thought - must have been given loads of painkillers as I was floating on air for several days afterwards! I now have 2 scars, underarm and breast. Sore but getting better. They looked horrible when the plasters came off but even after 2 1/2 weeks they are fading and I think don't look too bad. The only downside I've found is tiredness and a need to rest - but I've got a few years on you, now 60! I really hope you get the help you need for your Dad, and your children, and wish you all the very best for tomorrow. Sheila Bee. ",

      "Content": "Hi Patterbelle I am so sorry to hear this. I think I can understand what you are going through. My daughter was diagnosed with Stage 1 Grade 2 cervical cancer 3 years ago, aged 28. Needles to say, I was desperately worried, as were the whole family. But the much-maligned NHS did wonders. She was treated by one of the top surgeons in the country (probably due to her age.) And there's been no sign of recurrence since, thank God.  However, within 6 months, I was ill myself, diagnosed with breast cancer (since successfully treated). I'm convinced this came about due to stress. So do make sure you look after yourself as much as you can at this very stressful time.  Wishing you and your daughter very best wishes Sheila ",

      "Content": "Hi Mumof3abitlost If it's any help, I had 3 'periods' when I was definitely post-menopausal and well into my 50s. (This was several years before the breast cancer). I was referred to a gynaecologist and had a scan - nothing amiss and it was put down to a hormonal surge.  I can understand that you are feeling worried, however, and it seems to be a common experience to think that cancer has spread. Every ache and pain I have, I'm convinced is something sinister! But so far, so good.  Wishing you all the best for your treatment.",

      "Content": "Hi Grandnap I finished my 15-session course of RT on 31st January. I've always needed a good night's sleep. I started feeling tired quite early on and by the mid-point was having about 10 hours' sleep a night plus a nap after lunch of 1 - 2 hours. By 9 in the evening the need to sleep would come over me like a blanket. In spite of all of this this, though, I felt tired most of the time!  When I saw the oncologist post RT he told me this would last up to 3 months following the last session. I'm nearly at that point and in the past fortnight I have been feeling more like the old me, though sometimes still need a nap in the afternoon. All I can say is listen to your body.  I used R1 and R2 cream (on prescription), which was great, though I did have some soreness and blistering under my breast by the end. This went quite quickly though.  I hope this is helpful and wish you all the best. Xx",
