    "Content": "Hi,  i have invasive ductal breast cancer, it\u2019s grade three and triple negative. Was diagnosed last Thursday and that was less than three weeks from myself finding lump.  I\u2019m 43 and live in Devon with my amazing husband and three children. I now have a treatment plan in place, a start date for chemo and have had a clip put in lump and bone scan with a ct scan next Thursday. I\u2019m still in shock, my whole family and friends are shocked too, we\u2019ve not had a family member with cancer so this is new to all of us. I just wanted to say Hi to you all, I came across this group chat whilst waiting for my biopsy results, it\u2019s been a great help so far, have a lovely weekend  L xx",
