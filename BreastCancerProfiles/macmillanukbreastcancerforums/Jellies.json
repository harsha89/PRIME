      "Content": "Well there you go -  many thanks to all those who replied to help  get here. Thanks also for the input about the old nails.  Been and done a little shop today for my array of gloves.  Got  pack of 20 vinyl ones too to keep all over the house  for when my yearning to do housework comes back post op  LOL. (like that is  likely to happen !). Have given them a very long soak in nice moiiturising  hand soap warm water and cut  my nails to  help the theatre and ward staff to not catch them on anything - like the blessed oximeter .  Black nail varnish  -  whats all that about  ?",

      "Content": "HI and thanks Adrian  and G n' J.  (Sad face thingy) BUT - I can't see a  `new discussion button ` to click on.  I have a choice of Latest Activity/ Discussion/Members.  When I click on Discussion, rather than having an option of `New discussion` it takes me back to the home page -  very odd.  Is it also  usually  slow,  it is painfully slow when I click on anything -  maybe my  laptop is trying to give up the ghost ! ",
