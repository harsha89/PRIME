    "Content": "Hi Kai 1) I agree with previous posts, I was only confirmed as cancer after biopsies 15th July.   2) I had 2 lumps over a 6cm area and I'm stage 2 type 2, my friend had 3 x1 cm lumps but were in situ (within the duct) so had to have a mastectomy but assessed as a stage 1 (8yrs ago) another had 1 ductal lump and fine 18yrs later.  Mine's invasive lobular.  Muliple lumps not unusual but often mean its a mastectomy rather than lumpectomy but make sure u get the biopsy evidence. 3) I think this is the toughest time at the beginning but hey I'm still going through the process.  Just be supportive, be as normal as u can be. I found dealing with my families emotions made it harder. I felt more sorry for them espcially my hubby who was blaming himself - heaven knows why.  the why me, why now question can't be answered 1 in 8 women post menopause get it. I was unlucky. listen to her needs, I needed to understand cancer and did a lot of online research, hubby wanted me to stop cos he thought I was frightening myself but after a while he just let me get on with it as knowledge is power and you know what questions to ask of your surgeon n oncologist. Initially I didn't want to go out or talk to friends or tell anyone as people ask you how u are n I didn't want to lie n say fine but you can't blurt out in the middle of town u have cancer as u don't want to upset people n at first they think ur going to die.  When I got my head around things i did go out n tell people but said \"I'm not dying\"  its treatable, success rates are very good.  Keep positive.  You need to call the helpline, they're very good, hubby rang them cos he was crying more than me and he felt so much better afterwards. hope that helps. Anna",
