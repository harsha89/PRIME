      "Content": "Hi all. 4 weeks since I was told the dreaded words no one wants to hear. Due to have left side mastectomy, lymph node removed on same side then lumpectomy on right side this coming Wednesday. Nerves have definitely kicked in now because know it's start of my long journey.  Hadn't really told many people until Recently after  we told our 11 year old. Feeling really fed up with people saying Oh don't worry breast cancer is so easy to treat nowadays and the best line is oh I would have had both of them taken off and be done with it. They don't know what it feels like to be losing one so why say that. Aaaarrrgghhh! Makes me so angry its me and my body. Sorry rant over. Past week my mind has been a total mess :( hugs to everyone going for surgery, results or anything to do with this evil disease xxx",
