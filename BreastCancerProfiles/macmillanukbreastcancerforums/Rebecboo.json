      "Content": "Thankyou for the reply crystal juju x I just need to get a grip on myself again and not let this battle take over my life! I'm hoping after Monday things will look a bit more positive. I can only hope.  You are right thought. TNBC hangs over me like a dark cloud! It really does. And everything is unknown really because everyone is different I guess.  Sounds like you are well on your way to being back on track in your life x I'm so very pleased for you xx I am going to get my information out I had from a macmillan visit I had initially and see if there is anything that might be suitable to help me right now.  On top of all this I am still undecided on full mastectomy and have agreed to gene testing for Brac genes although results won't be back in time to make decisions before radio needs to start I don't think. This I need to double check!! My head is in a spin I tell you.   ",

      "Content": "I'm right with you aswell! I'm aged 38 years old. Have stage 1 grade 3 triple negative breast cancer. Diagnosed in May. Had neo adjuvant chemo FEC T which was a roller coaster in itself. Have just had lumpectomy and awaiting my results which is  Monday next week. I am on the most awful emotional roller coaster right now. During chemo I wasn't too bad and quite positive but it seems the further I go along the worse it gets. I have the most wonderful husband who seems to be holding it together and a beautiful 2 year old little girl. The trouble is sometimes having these lovely things make my emotions worse, because all I can think IS the worst. :( I can see other family members and friends worries about me, paticularly my mum which hurts me alot knowing I've caused this. I too am suffering with aches and pains. I keep thinking the worst about those too. I am just trying to cling onto every bit of positive that I can. It frustrates the hell out of me because I'm usually the most positive and organised person ever! At the minute this just isn't so. I've been off work since May as I couldn't work due to chemo and infection risks as I am a front line nhs worker. This too gets me down. I have brilliant family and friends who are constantly trying to gee me up and keep me going to which are am very thankful of.  Its good to read others opinions on here and advice as the only people that understand are the ones in similar situations. Has anybody used any groups or counselling for support at all. I haven't yet but feel I may need to soon :(    ",
