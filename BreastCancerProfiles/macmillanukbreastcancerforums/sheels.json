    "Content": "i have been taking arimidex for 7months, as i am post menopausel, however, after a recent scan i was told that the medication hasnt performed as was expected. iam going to hospital tommorrow for a pre op assesment, i am pretty scared of the results, i have other health issues which may affect the descision re a lumpectomy. i did ask my nurse what happens if surgery is not an option, she did say that it could mean alternative medication, but what i have no idea. i must agree the side effects of arimidex are very wearing, i never know whether its the medication or just plain old age, aches and pains galore. wish me luck, best wishes to everyone. love sheels",
