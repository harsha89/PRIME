    "Content": "Hi Trina I share your frustration and concern. I had 3 drains initially and am now down to one which has been there for 19 days. I have had several trips to the clinic and each time have been told that I am still producing too much fluid to have it removed. At least I got rid of the bottle one after about 10 days - it was getting very heavy! My very handy mum made me a cotton across the body bag to carry them round in - much easier than the plastic bag I had before. Anyway, I am told that producing a lot of fluid doesn't really mean anything - neither good nor bad - it's just one of those things and better to be out of you than in ! I have another appoinment today and fingers crossed I can get rid of it. Don't worry , ask questions of whoever you can to reassure you, and best of luck. Btw - I have had excellent service from the distict nurses and was given a spare bottle from the hospital so I'm sorry Wendi 63 had not such a good experience.xx    ",
