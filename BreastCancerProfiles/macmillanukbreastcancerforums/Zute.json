    "Content": "Hi Carol! So so sorry you find yourself here, but you will find the Mac site a great place to 'let off steam' as well as an excellent support. The feelings you have are so understandably 'normal'. My husband John (56 years old) was exactly the same when diagnosed with his neck, mouth and throat cancer some 5 months ago. He carried on working as much as possible, even through treatment, but something had to 'give' somewhere and unfortunately that was mostly aimed at me. Like me, I'm sure your family will understand like we all did with John. Afraid it's the age old case of sort of 'taking it out on yourself and the ones you love'  cos you know your family will support you no matter what. It's tough from both perspectives and the only advice i can give you really (tho we're all very different with the way we deal with things) is to talk and lean on those closest to you.   Good luck and I wish you all the VERY best as you embark upon this unfair and extremely tough journey. Love Zute xxx",
