    "Content": "Hi I found out a couple of weeks ago that I also have Pagets Disease and that the removal of the nipple was the only option too.  You mention here about easy reconstruction, but I've been told that the only options are a tattoo or prosthetic - am I missing something? I've managed to get my head around the fact that I have this (just) and that it's treatable which I'm very grateful for, I have surgery scheduled for next week and I'm so far from being emotionally ready for living with the scarring and all that comes with that psychologically.  I know I should be grateful and it sounds vain, I'm really not vain but being single (and not wanting to be) is a kick in the teeth.  Like most women, and men I guess, I have my body hangups, but this one seems really difficult to cope with.  Every time I think of it I get really upset (can't actually see what I'm typing now because I'm crying).  I already have a huge scar from belly button to bikini line and was booked in for a hysterectomy when this came up so starting to feel pretty crappy. I'm aware that I'm luckier than many here, so I'm sorry if it sounds silly but I don't really know where else to turn. Thanks",
