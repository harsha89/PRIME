      "Content": "Hi I'm new to the group.  My second time of having breast cancer - 1st time was 15 years ago, big shock that it came back.  Had op 2 weeks ago, cancer was all in the axillia/armpit and has spread to lymph nodes.   Now waiting for chemo treatment plan.  Not sure when it will start. I've just read all your posts and am a bit worried/scared. Last time I had chemo - 15 years ago - I had it every 3 weeks on a Thursday evening.  Was sick for 4 days, but then back at work on the Tuesdays.  So I coped with not much time off work, just a Fri and a Mon every 3rd week.  Reading all your posts - you all seem so tired, so often.   I was not expecting this, so am now unsure how I will feel.   Also, am confused by all the different drugs you mention.  15 years ago I wasnt told what I was given.  So much has changed. I thought I could handle this,  now I'm not so sure.",

Consultamt said normally they would attempt radiotherapy after operating.  But  not in my case because I have had radio in that area before  and you cant have it again in same place.  At the moment they are just telling me to wait and see what happens when they do op, to see how much they manage to remove, and then they will decide what to do.  ",
