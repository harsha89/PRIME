      "Content": "hi liz thanks for your comment ive not really asked questions yet but when i next get to see my onc i will ask only been once since my op and rads and we talked mainly about my osteoporosis i have in my hips and he was just the understudy to my onc but very nice he drew me diagramms and everything which was very helpful, so if i do see him again then i will ask i think i will have all the questions written down before i go mind you i did do that when i first saw my onc but never asked the questions i was so nervous and really did not want chemo and i got what i wanted but after reading posts on here and another forum i joined i am nervous about it comimg back or maybe even secondary but i suppose its the same for everyone whos had bc we all can just live in hope coz there's nothing we can do to stop it i didnt do anything wrong to get it in the first place so there no point in worrying is there? (she says!!!! lol) jackie xx",

      "Content": "Hi everyone i am new to this site i just read all your posts and just want to say that as my dx was grade 3 hormone no node involvement i was not offered chemo because of other health issues but was offered to have my ovaries taken out or radiated which opted to the latter i have been great since but always wonderd whether it can return in the other breast and reading some of your posts it can i thought that if the hormones were stopped it can not return so what is the other type of cancer you can get if its not hormone? its so confusing.",
