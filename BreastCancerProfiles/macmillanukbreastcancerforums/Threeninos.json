    "Content": "I'm glad to see this post although it appears to be more than 6 years later.  I had a mammogram and subsequent ultrasound because of dense breasts, soreness, and underarm lumps that were tender.  All ruled out any problems. But, I continue to have breast soreness and sometimes the underarm lumps appear with soreness and disappear. Because I had a hysterectomy more than 30 years ago, I am wondering if my sticky underarms are a sign of or pointing to something the doctors and the tests have missed. I have stopped using deodorant and they are still sticky. I'm baffled. ",
