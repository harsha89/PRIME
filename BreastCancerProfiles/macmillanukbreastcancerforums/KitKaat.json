      "Content": "This is on behalf of my mum, were both up to high do as we've been kept in the dark so are scanning the internet for help!! Mum is due to get an operation in less than a week to remove a cancerous lump from her breast, she has discovered that she may have 3broken ribs and is going for an x ray tomorrow.. the doctor said today that the anethnatist will have to be informed of this but never actually stated why. Does anybody have any idea if this will have any influence on the operation? If it will have to be rescheduled or should it be okay? Its on the opposite side that needs to be operated on..Â ",
