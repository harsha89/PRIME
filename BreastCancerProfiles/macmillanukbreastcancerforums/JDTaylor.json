      "Content": "Hi I was diagnosed last Nov had my lump removed just before Xmas and so far have had 3 FEC sessions. The first was bad but have got used to it. I am having 1st Docataxel today, everyone says it may not be as bad but reading the discussions I am in for a shock. It is good however to be prepared and know what to expect I was given dexamethasone steroids to take the day before and now cannot sleep . Has anyone else had steroids before there tax and did they help? Thanks",

      "Content": "Hi all I finished chemo for BC at the end of April and had radiotherapy in June so it's around 6 months since all that finished. I was made redundant so was not able to return to my current job, I am now trying to look for another job but seem to be picking up all the coughs and colds that are going. I had a bad cold a couple of weeks ago and now I have a throat infection and aural thrush again ( I suffered with a lot of aural thrush during my three treatments of Docataxel). I am just feeling so worthless and down everyone thinks that because I'm looking for a job I must be ok but I'm really not ok. I Sometimes think that if I could get back out to work then maybe I would stop feeling sorry for myself but feeling poorly for the last few weeks has made me worried that the chemo has ruined my immune system and I am going to keep getting bugs and viruses. Before my cancer I was very rarely off sick from work. I just seem to keep crying a lot and my husband doesn't really know what to say. I would love to hear from anyone who has experienced these sort of feelings months after their treatment ended. Thanks Julie",

      "Content": "Thank you so much for your replies it makes such a difference to know other people are going through the same feelings.I know exactly what you mean about feeling guilty about others who are suffering. I think what have I got to worry about I have finished my treatment and I've survived! I will try and stop worrying about getting back to full time work until I am ready. Thanks again Julie",
