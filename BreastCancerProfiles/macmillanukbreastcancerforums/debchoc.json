      "Content": "I have been on both of these since 2012 and like you have been suffering with the enduced menopausal symptoms. I now take the tamoxifen in the morning about 6ish by 8.30 the heat is bad but luckily not sweating just get very hot and then it goes. I tried taking it at night but I felt worse during the night. I have cotton sheets and often throw the duvet over my husband. As for the Zoladex injections I don't like them at least they are only once a month. I spoke to my oncologist about the side effects he said I could have evening primrose tables but I did not find them very good. I am 54 this year and was hoping that my last lot of blood tests would show that I was in the menopause so I could stop the jabs. But as yet no sign. Two months ago I had reconstruction a Diep Flap and had to stop taking the tablets 3 weeks before surgery and then start 3 weeks after surgery. What a difference it made able to sleep and no heat problems. Also lost a bit of weight but that has now gone back on now back on the medication. I understand how it can get you down but I just keep thinking its doing me good and anyway you can have bad days. message me if you need a chat anytime Debby   Enter your message...",
