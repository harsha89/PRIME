The Dr wrote something in the letter (second opinion) that I would like a copy of. I have been asking 7 months for this second opinion as I believe my cancer has been around much longer but was missed. I have had to ask at just about every appointment if he had got this opinion and was even told that it wouldn't make a difference to my treatment now??  His letter implied that the cancer was there but small from the opinion from the second DR. This is the report that I would like to read myself. Lizxxx",

I am stiff when I wake up, then once I get moving it eases off but then if I\u2019ve been on my feet longer than an hour it get worse and worse.
