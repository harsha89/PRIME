      "Content": "Tigermum and pinklady -  I feel your distress!  My tastebuds have been missing in action since Friday.  I\u2019ve had 3 x EC and one Docetaxel so far last Monday (26th).  Each time has had an effect on my tastebuds but this is horrendous - everything tastes like it has sweetener tipped all over it.  Some things taste bitter too.  I can\u2019t even face water.  Cheese makes me heave and I love cheese.  Apart from that have had painful bones and am increasingly tired as chemos go on but am now missing food.  I can\u2019t even enjoy my advent calendar.  It\u2019s a cruel world!!!",
