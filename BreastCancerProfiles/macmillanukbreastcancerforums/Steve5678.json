    "Content": "Hi Pootlecav Sorry you have been feeling so down. Please, Please, Please, do your research before embarking on antidepressants I was treated for a base of tongue tumour in 2015, thankfully the treatment was successful...unfortunately, like yourself, I suffered terrible depression. I struggled on to a point where I couldnt take the mental pain any more and went to my doctor...who prescribed me Sertraline 50mg. It was a while before I summoned the courage to take the tablets...this was the worst decision of my life! I took the Sertraline for 3 days before the terrible side effects made it impossible to continue. These included; Severe tinnitus Sleep disturbance...I can only sleep for about 1.5 hours a night Memory and cognition problems Some weird sexual dysfunctions These \"side effects\" seem to be permanent, even though my last dose was 7 months ago. I agree, this extreme reaction is not that common and I dont want to frighten you, but PLEASE check out: \"lets talk withdrawal' 'surviving antidepressants'Â  'PSSD' I really wish I had been better informed before I started taking Sertraline. I can honestly say dealing with my cancer was easier than dealing with this unknown. I wish you all the best in your recovery from the cancer and the depression.",
