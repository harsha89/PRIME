      "Content": "Hi everyone. I am glad I found this site & hope that someone can help me a little. I have a lump on my right breast, I have had this for months but was told nothing showed up on my ultrasound. I then had another scan on Monday at the local hospital (transfered after a recent house move) & they found a small lump on the outside edge of the breast (6mm or so) which showed up black on the scan. I have now been booked in for breast MRI on Tuesday 21st July. I am not sure what to expect & the letter stated that a contrast agent may be used. Will this be the case for a breast MRI? I am very confused as to what is going on as the consultants at both the hospitals I have been seen at are not telling me anything. I would be grateful for any experiences of breast MRI's from anyone & perhaps an idea as to what they may be giving me one for. I have a strong family history of BC under age 40. Thanks in advance Cathy xxx",
