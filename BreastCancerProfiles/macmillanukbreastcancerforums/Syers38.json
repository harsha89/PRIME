I thought cause I had triple negative ductal breast cancer that it was a better to have ( well none are better ) but I'm a bit shaken to find it is more aggressive and can travel through blood ... I can't take it all in . My lymph nodes are clear and have told me I have clear margins ... Now my mind is focusing on blood overthinking it all .. I have been very possotive but this has knocked me back a bit .. Chemo to start next week with EC and then taxol for 9 weeks.... Was thinking of cold cap but can't make my mind up so many decisions to make .. Anyone in the same boat ... I'm on a struggling day today any help would be appreciated . Xxxxx",
