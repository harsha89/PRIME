Bit of a cough and tight chest but had that for a few weeks now so just keeping an eye on it, checking my temp all the time ! Yes, I think you are right taking each day at a time. I've rested most the day today so hopefully will have some energy tomorrow. Wait and see, hope you have a good weekend.",

Mine is also vascular invasive tho nodes clear and even tho the oncologist was not going to send me for ct scans I requested them as I feel for me it's best to know upfront what you are dealing with so the best possible treatment plan can be put in place.

I have pineapple so will bear that in mind too. Thanks. I have been keeping a diary since diagnosis back in October as suggested by the Breast Nurse at the hospital. She said that it would come in useful when on chemo and 3 days in I'm finding this is really the case. Xx",

      "Content": "Hi Cathy. I have found your post really interesting. I am currently half way through 6 x FEC and tried the no carbs thing myself for 2 days before and 2 days after chemo highlighted by Gillie B on a post a few weeks ago. I too found that the side effects were less, no hot flushes or sweats that I had had previously for 3 days after chemo and no loss of energy. In fact, I felt like I had more energy than normal ! Did get constipation like you but overall side effects were reduced. If you have any other recipe or food suggestions I would be very interested to hear about them. Thanks for your post, it's good to know it's worked for others too. Jenny.x",

      "Content": "Hi Star, I had my third FEC 10 days ago and too had heard that reducing carb intake 2 days before and 2 days after reduces some side effects and fatigue. I did try it and yes, for me some of the side effects ie hot flushes/night sweats that I've had past 2 chemos were not there, also my energy levels were almost normal. I have found tho I've been more constipated this week, lactalose sorting that tho. Getting some prune juice with my weekly shop this week also. I must admit tho I do find it hard to drink large volumes so that may be a factor for me. I'm going to speak to the oncologist about diet as not much has been mentioned to me about it. Jenny.x",

In saying that tho, I too am following the 4 day low carb diet which I have found has helped me regain my energy levels quicker and taken away the hot sweats and flushes I had with previous chemos. Heartburn is my problem at the mo so just eating plain food to try and combat it as gaviscon doesn't seem to be making much difference. Hope you all get some relief tho ladies over the following few days. Jenny.x",
