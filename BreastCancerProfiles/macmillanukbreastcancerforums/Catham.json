    "Content": "Hi Jo I did laugh when I read about your 'hair shower' experience as it was the perfect description of when I lost most of mine. I've also described it as something our of a Hitchcock horror movie!! I've just finished 6 sessions of chemo (3xEC 3xTax) & I also went from having very thick, shoulder length dark brown (coloured) to very, very thin, patchy mostly grey hair. I lost probably 90% of my head hair. I wear a wig all the time or hat at home&in bed.Â  My 2 young boys hate to see me without the wig/hat. I also feel people are looking at me&know that it''s a wig! I'm just grateful that we're in winter so I can always cover my wig with a hat!! Have you finished all your chemo now? BW Catx",
