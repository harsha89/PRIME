      "Content": "Hi all, today I have been diagnosed with breast cancer. I felt a lump in my breast so went to see the doctor and she referred me to the breast clinic. I have been there today and they have given me a mammogram and taken 4 biopsies. They said I have a 30mm lump and a 5mm lump and the other side with some swollen lymph nodes. I am now awaiting the results of the biopsy and can not sleep. To top it off I have been told I have to stop breastfeeding so I have one sore boob from the biopsy and one sore boob from engorgement! I don\u2019t really know what I\u2019m asking, I suppose I\u2019m just looking for positive stories and what to expect. ",

I went to see the oncologist yesterday who finally had my ct results back (from 6 weeks ago!) and she said I have a very small nodule on my lung. She said she\u2019s not worried about it but I will have to go for another scan in around 6 weeks to check that it\u2019s not growing. I am now petrified that it\u2019s spread to my lungs and that I\u2019m not going to be able to get over this and will be leaving my two girls behind   shes basically said it could be scar tissue from an infection or a million other things but I can\u2019t help but think the worst.

They basically said they weren\u2019t worried and they would just monitor it.  Ive since had another ct scan and they\u2019re now saying there\u2019s no way of telling for certain if they are or aren\u2019t cancer cells so are now talking about treatment just to be on the safe side. The consultant was basically saying she doesn\u2019t really know what to do, that in her heart of hearts she doesn\u2019t think it is anything to worry about but on the other hand if it is and they don\u2019t treat it it\u2019s obviously going to be a mistake. She\u2019s going to chat to her colleagues and come back with a decision.  My heads just all over right now, I don\u2019t know what to think or do. I thought I had finally finished all my treatment but now to be told I could be going onto pertuzumab indefinitely has just brought my down with a bang.  I don\u2019t really know what I\u2019m asking, I just needed to get it out there I suppose.  XxX",

My sickness meds didn\u2019t work the first night so I was throwing up all night and then pretty much slept for 2 days. I\u2019ve been in hospital yesterday as temp was slightly high but all ok thankfully. The main issue I\u2019m having is my needle/cannula phobia, it\u2019s making me so stressed and physically sick, I threw up everywhere yesterday when they put it in. My mum has rang a hypnotherapist to try and help with the issue, has anyone done this before? I\u2019m a bit worried about what they\u2019ll find in there haha ",

LiziX  are all your children school age? If so I would say try and rest as much as you can while they are at school. I have a 4yr old and a 6 month old so not much of that going on here! Luckily I have lots of family around to help out and typically my first treatment was the first week of the Easter holidays!  To everyone else who is well on their way, my hair has started falling out today, my 6 month old managed to grab a big chunk is it best to shave it off now? I am going for my wig tomorrow. ",
