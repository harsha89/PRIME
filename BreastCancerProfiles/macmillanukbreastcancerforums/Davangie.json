Mine is a fuzz at present but someone told me that the recommendation is to have it the first hair shaved off again to allow better growth? I'm reluctant to lose anymore hai, but if that's what it takes....?? I had my first haircut last week after finishing chemo in January. I feel much better as ti is now neat and tidy not wild and wooly. Hope this helps.",
