      "Content": "there are so many things that determine how many treatments, age, your health at time of diagnoses. how advanced the cancer is, just to name a few, I was diagnosed with Bread C, in Nov,   small tumor but had mastectomy anyway.  Lymph nodes  were all clear but the tissue that was against the chest wall (tumor was very close the chest wall way back in the boob,  didn't make my oncologist happy.  Cell structure wasn't what he wanted to see, so now I having chemo but only 4 treayments..  Not sure about radiation yet.  This has all been my decision, with  a lot advise from my Dr.s     I don't feel great right now but it will be worth to not have to worry about  a recurrence in a couple of years.  I'm am 65 so that helps.  I will be put on Herseptin (sp) for 5 years following treatment,   That medication depends on the age of the woman,  if per-memopausal  most likely it would be timoxifin . Hope that clears up some the confusion. but you really need to talk Dr.s and nurses to help you figure it out Good luck Donna",
