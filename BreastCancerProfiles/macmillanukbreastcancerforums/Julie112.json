My right foot is still numb under the toes and part of the ball of the foot, but again is slowly improving. I had my first check up post chemo and RT just before Xmas and was told that the numbness should go but can take a long time. So bear with it....it does get better. I have only just lost fingernails in the last 2 weeks...think it is the end of tthe chemo drugs 'growing out' so it is great to see those bits falling off and good nails growing through underneath. Good luck....just need my hair to grow a bit quicker now!! Julie x",

      "Content": "Hi Sheila I had 2 policies, one which I hadn't known Bout through work, and they both sent out a claim form straight away. I forwarded this to my oncologist, who sent them onto the companies. Both paid out straight away with no queries or hassle. It's the sort of thing you never want to have to claim! I deliberately bought something 'positive' for my children. The youngest had a scuba diving course. He is now qualified, and going abroad soon for a diving holiday. We would never have been able to afford this without the policy, and I now, 12 months on from diagnosis, have a strong sense that something good and positive came out of it. I also bought myself something small but nice, which I wouldn't have bought otherwise. If you can, try to enjoy it!! Julie xx",

      "Content": "Hi, It's been a little while since I have written on here...my treatment finished in November 2012, but I read what you said and you will see from the response how many people feel the same. I was advised to google 'dr Peter Harvey, after treatment finishes'. It is an easy to ready article which explains really well the normality of feeling like you, me, and thousands of other people feel after treatment. I keep a copy of it at home, and still read it occasionally to show myself the feelings I still get are normal. 9 months on for me, and life is becoming much Better. But I don't think it will ever be the same as it was. In some ways it's better now (I appreciate everything more, and don't worry about unimportant things) but what a price to pay !! My hospital ran a moving forward after cancer course over 4 weeks which was excellent, but there is no doubt the battle after treatment is not as easy as many people would think. Reflecting on all that has happened is important...it has been a massive part of our lives. Good luck xx",

Someone said on this forum a few months ago to google 'dr Peter Harvey article 3'. I I did and it pretty much summed up a lot of what I felt post treatment, and what is completely normal to feel. It is a very reassuring read, and I still turn to it now when I think I am going mad and no one can possible understand how I feel - ridiculous I know, because all the wonderful ladies here do understand! Try it, it might help you understand your own emotions too. Good luck. It is weird how these emotions come at the end, when you feel you have coped so well with it all. Keep smiling, Julie x",

By now in the cycle I am usually dreading the next, so to look in my diary and know on the usual Monday (bloods) and Wednesday (chemo) with no such appointments is pure bliss. I read all the posts and wish that everyone on this site was at the same stage. I wouldn't wish the fec-t on anyone! All the normal things are so fab to do, Although I am yet to enjoy a glass of wine as it still tastes awful to me, as mot things do, so I really hope my taste returns soon. Enjoy every day, and good luck for the rest of your treatment. Hold onto that big smile xxx",

      "Content": "Hi.it is so difficult for friends and family around those of us who have been diagnosed. My 17 year old son is still struggling with my illness, despite the fact that I have had lumpectomy, chemo and radiotherapy this year, which finished on 5 November. I took my headscarf off this week, and previously he had asked me to put it back on. I now have a little hair...and when I took it off yesterday he was ok with it. Al you can do is give love and reassurance to your mum. Tell her how you feel too - she will be overawed by your care. I am 'lucky' that my treatment is hopefully over, but there can be many positives that come out of it. The people who really do love me have told and showed me, and I have really appreciated it. It makes you realise how important people are. You mum will surely feel the same, and hopefully want to show you too how much she appreciates your care. Spend quality time together if you can...do things you wouldn't normally do! I have spent days with friends where I have bought a picture, visited a place I hadn't thought of before, and even now look back on the good times through this awful time that probably wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for the cancer. Now I can look forward, and before you know it, you will too. Try and have a relaxed Christmas. Lots of love xx",
