      "Content": "Hi everyone, im new on here and terrified. I was diagnosed with stage 3 multifocal breast cancer with majority lymph node involvement on 18 Dec, due to a chest infection my surgery was delayed 5 weeks, im now 10 weeks post diagnosis and feel like this inside me could be spreading everywhere. Im having a nipple ans skin sparing mastectomy with lymph node clearance with chemo and radiotherapy. I am having terrible shoulder and arm pain: could this be due to the lymph involvement. Any advice and support is very welcome x",
