      "Content": "I have recently been diagnosed with Stage 2 breast cancer of the duct (1cm) which had started to spread. I am HER2 negative and my nodes are clear. I had wide incision surgery two months ago March 2018 to remove the cancer and surrounding tissue, followed by radiotherapy. The thought of it coming back is with me a lot of the time and I don't feel \"healed\". I have lost several relatives through this disease, a Granny, Aunties and cousins (my mother was not affected). I am wondering if I should have a double mastectomy to give me more peace of mind? I want to move forward if possible.",

      "Content": "Dear Jo Thank you for replying to me and explaining a few things that were going round in my mind. I am booked to see the Oncologist in two weeks time and now feel clearer about the things that I need to ask. I don't feel so worried any more because of yours and Kandy's answer. Thank you so much and bless you xxÂ ",
