    "Content": "Sorry but it is evident your fundraising team and the rest of Macmillan don\u2019t care how horrible these adverts are and how anxiety inducing they are whilst going through this wether it\u2019s yourself or as a family. 2 years on since this post and the adverts \u2018a lover with cancer is still a lover\u2019 etc etc make us feel physically sick when they come on TV. All they act as are reminders. They are not hopeful or encouraging or positive they are very real reminders about how \u2018un-normal\u2019 we all feel. Which is Ironic comsidering the adds are meant to support feeling normal etc - we would have felt normal. Sitting happily as a family watching a family film on a Saturday evening - laughing, chatting. Spending quality time together. Until these adverts come on and the whole room goes silent and the mood changes. These adverts ruin any sense of normality cancer sufferers feel which is a problem considering they don\u2019t get very many actual normal moments. When we do, it\u2019s rare and it\u2019s cherished. But more often than not, It\u2019s ruined by these abolsutely ridiculously insensitive adverts that remind us of how painful this whole process has and continues to be. Leave us in peace to enjoy our normal moments minus the unnecessary reminders!!!!!",
