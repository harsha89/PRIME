    "Content": "I was diagnosed in March 2010 with breast cancer; it was the sort that could come back in 2 years. I had a mastectomy at the end of April 2010 and then had a complete auxiliary node clearance in June, they found the cancer had spread to 2 nodes in level 3, skipping levels 1 and 2.  1of the nodes was almost completely cancerous and the other had spread beyond the node and into the surrounding blood vessels, I had a CT scan & a Bone scan in 2010, both came back ok, I had 6 treatments of chemotherapy followed by radiation therapy. Last course of chemo was 10th November 2010 and last course of radiation therapy was 23rd December 2010. I had back ache some time last year and told my breast cancer nurse, who spoke with my consultant and he arranged for me to have another bone scan which came back ok. I have now had pain in my back for just over a week, the pain is between my shoulder blades, I can get up in a morning with no pain but it comes on over the day, other days I can get up with mild pain that gets worse as the day goes on. I\u2019m not sure if it might be something to do with the cancer, and I\u2019m a little scared about it, I did try and get to see my own GP today but can\u2019t get in to see her for about 2 weeks. I\u2019m not sure if I should be worried or not.  ",
