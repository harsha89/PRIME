    "Content": "Hi Lita I've had an expander reconstruction. I was told a lot about it by my surgeon so knew and understood what to expect. If youv'e had radiotherapy the skin doesn't stretch much so little boobs are better (a or b cup). It takes about 9 months from when the expander is put in (op takes about 1 hour) til you get the implant. The new boob doesn't look like the old one, so you don't get a matching pair. What you do get is short stays in hospital, no other bits of the body involved so no other scars and something that gives a bit of a cleavage and looks good in allsorts of clothing. Hope this helps Daisy",
