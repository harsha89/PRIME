      "Content": "Ive always struggled with maintaining a healthy weight , I\u2019m 51 , 5 foot 7 and it\u2019s varied between a low 9-10 and a high  13-4 over the years . At diagnosis last April  I weighed 11-9 and I\u2019ve been on tamoxifen for a year and it crept up again to. 12-4 although I  don\u2019t think tamoxifen caused me to put on weight if I\u2019m honest I\u2019ve just been greedy .  I hope to have a breast reduction this year on my \u201cgood\u201d breast to match my implant breast for size and perkiness and therefore  need to reduce it as much as possible naturally before the operation , so six weeks ago I embarked on 1000 calories a day diet . I have managed to lose 12 pounds so far , a pretty much constant 2 pounds a week. Ive made up my own diet , mostly consisting of shop bought soups , vegetables and fruit and whilst very boring and repetitive , it\u2019s filling and more importantly it\u2019s working . Ive had to stop any form of socialising though and no alcohol as these trigger me to overeat . I\u2019ve used the my fitness pal app which keeps a track of the calories and it\u2019s been really very helpful .  I\u2019ve not had chemo or radiotherapy , just a mastectomy , so don\u2019t know to what extent these may affect your body\u2019s ability to lose weight , but hope this experience may encourage people to know some people can lose weight whilst on tamoxifen .  I do understand  how you feel about your body , having a scarred nipple - less 32D left breast and a 32H right one is bad enough , but an extra two stone does nothing for your confidence ! I do hope you find an eating plan which works for you to help you lose the weight and also  continued good health and happiness . ",

      "Content": "Hi - this happened to me after my mastectomy where the ibuprofen and paracetamol weren't touching the nerve pain . I put up with it for weeks and rang the breast care nurses who refered  me to my gp . I got a telephone appointment with my gp who basically was prepared to  prescribed me anything I wanted ( in a responsible way I would add ) . I had researched the pain type and worked out amiltriptaline was most suitable for my type of pain . I  Picked up the prescription the same day , started it hours later and within 24 hours pain was gone .your pharmacy won't have the strengths the gp can prescribe so I'd recommend going straight to the gp.  Good luck xxx ",

      "Content": "Hi Kerry - congratulations on nesting the end of chemo . I was lucky and only needed a mastectomy with immediate implant and then on to tamoxifen . Like you I was dreading it and prepared my husband for every possible side effect . However it's been eleven eeeks now and apart from the odd warm moment - I can't even call it a hot flush - I've been fine. I think you should give it a go and reevaluate if And when you do get adverse reactions as I think you could regret it if you don't throw everything at it. Hope this helps your decision - feel free to ask any questions if you'd like . Best wishes x ",

      "Content": "Thanks for that , I also read they weren't that good but based on what you've said I'll definately try your one. I've Only been on tamoxifen for five weeks . I've not had real full in body sweats yet - just some warm moments in bed but I suspect I have that joy coming ! I've also bought a brilliant little three speed portable fan which folds up in to your handbag or becomes a mini desk fan  - amazing effect on third speed . That's from amazon about.  12-99 or 9-99 if you get it from a Chinese stockist on there . ",
