      "Content": "Hi Michele   I am so sorry to hear your news.  It is so hard, but all I can say is that thus far my dealings with the NHS the surgeons and nurses have all been extremely positive.  They know so much now and can do so much for us.  You must have had such a difficult weekend.  When you go back to see the oncologist and know what will happen next and can plan for it, hopefully you will begin to feel more able to deal with it all.  You need to feel a sense of control and with all the waiting around for results and treatments,this is perhaps the one of the hardest things, certainly was for me.   I feel very fortunate. I wish I could be there to give you a hug.  Hope you have lots of support at home.   I am recovering well.  Like you my back and front still feel tight and I am having the seroma drained every week still.  But gradually more mobile and doing a little more every day.  I can sleep on one side now as well as my back, so progress there. All the surgical glue has come off the breast and it really doesn't look too bad!  The swelling is going down very slowly though.  I am hoping to start my new job at last in a couple of weeks time.  I started the tamoxifen a week ago and so far so good - no side effects - yet.   Wish you all the best   Take care and let me know how things go this week",

      "Content": "Hi castleton No expanders, they put an implant in straight away.  Yes, I think in the long term it will look pretty good, but takes a long time for the swelling and bruising to go down.  Also, I have a seroma build up on the breast, which they are reluctant to drain in case it becomes infected, so very lumpy, bumpy just now! It was definitely the best option for me, didn't fancy the tummy tuck idea - far too long recovery for me and longer operation.  The ld flap gives a good natural looking result, I have been shown lots of photos of the procedure and once they do the tatoo and nipple reconstruction it can look great..",

      "Content": "Hi Michele Just thought would let you know my results today - all good!  They did find some more dcis - high grade, but no invasive/aggressive cancer, so 5 years of tamoxifen and regular check ups. The relief was incredible. I feel so tired now and think it must be the tension that has built up with the long wait for results. Hope all goes well for you next week.  Let me know your progress.  I again feel a little better physically today, a little more mobile and less fluid building up on my back.  Just takes a long time for things to settle down - it is major surgery!  Take care, big hugs x",

      "Content": "Hi I am nearly 3 weeks post operation - mastectomy, ld flap reconstruction and implant.  Everything you say is as my experience and I am sure totally normal.  I have tightness across my bust and back almost all the time,  with occasional muscle spasms from the back muscle which is now my breast!  Feels very strange, almost like my bust is communicating with me, each time I do physical activity . I am very swollen and sore still, and think this will take several weeks or months to go completely.  I can say though that everyday I feel a little better and more myself. Keep strong and positive.  The surgery really is amazing and I have seen some amazing pictures of final results once they have reconstructed nipples and balanced out the other breast.  My next hurdle is tomorrow when I get the pathology results from the removal of breast tissue.  Hoping for the best - my diagnosis so far is DCIS, and 2 of 3 sentinel nodes taken had isolated/displaced tumor cells so hoping that they haven't found anything too major in there and treatment is straightforward, but know that can't count on anything until they tell me. It is such a shock to be going through this, but incredible how we cope and get on with it. And, although sad to see so many women experiencing breast cancer, also very reassuring to have people to talk too who know what you are going through to support and advise. Take care, things will get better",
