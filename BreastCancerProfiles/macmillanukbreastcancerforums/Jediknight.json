I draw my eyebrows in with a clinque superfine pencil which helps my look a bit. Now winter is here I find it easier in bobble hats and berets. I used to be in Toni & Guy every 3 weeks having my grey roots done and my beautiful long wavy brunette hair blow dried .. oh how I miss it ! BUT !! It will not last forever , I had 4 T and have just had my 3rd FEC. One more to go . Keep going Lorraine , how much treatment have you got left ?  xx",

      "Content": "Hi Gina I hope you are feeling a little better. Waiting for a diagnosis and treatment plan is the worse time , I think most people will agree. Once you know what you are dealing with you can face it head on and make plans. Try to stop thinking too far ahead, take each stage at a time whatever that may be.  I'm doing chemo , first was on July 3rd , surgery then radiotherapy. Losing my hair isn't great , I had it cut really short to minimise the shock and it's just starting to shed a bit now but to me it means the chemo is working , it's killing cells which means it's killing cancer cells too. I'm back at work today trying to keep a bit of normality going although I am lucky as I could swap to a quieter less demanding role. Your life has changed but it hasn't ended , it's just going to be different.  Good luck tomorrow , I am sure the known is better than the unknown. xx",

It has been a little tough at times and a little miserable too but nothing I couldn't handle and nothing lasted too long. The monthly chemo club is great , lots of support and advice. Regarding diet I was convinced I was going to be healthy and I have tried but to be honest when you are so tired and fed up you need some comfort food ! That said , now I am feeling better I am going to put more effort in and boot up my Nutribullet ! I also want to shed some weight before surgery so I am in good shape to recover. Good luck with everything, it truly is a horrible thing to go through but as many people said to me it is do-able and although some people do have a tougher time than most fingers crossed you will be okay. And when you're not ok , you come on here and moan and we all agree with you and hopefully make you feel better ! xx",

I got some difflam mouth wash yesterday from the day unit after my chemo , but I believe you can by over the counter. http://www.difflam.co.uk/ I had my first of 4 FEC yesterday , feeling okay at moment , heading into the unknown a little but less steroids , no gcsf injection so some positive points !  Hope you have a restful weekend xx",

      "Content": "Hi Bandele I would absolutely say yes to a PICC line. FEC is particularly hard on the veins and my unit will only give it via a PICC for this reason. I also think they have to be more cautious when they give it through a cannula as it is very toxic. Much better that it goes in a large vein that can take it ! I have had 4 x T and am now on my 3rd FEC. I have found it okay , compared to T the side effects for me have been much less. The main one I think is nausea. It's hard to tell as I have a few side effects left over from T. Make sure they give you Emend as an antiemetic. You take one tablet 1 hour before chemo then one the following two mornings after chemo. Most people do get prescribed it but some people haven't and have had to ask for it after having a dreadful time after their first FEC. You will prob be prescribed ondansetron and motilium too. Ondansetron is great but can make you constipated. I normally take a senna the night of my chemo to try and counteract this. Motilium basically helps your stomach empty quicker so is good before a meal and gets rid of any bloated feeling. You will prob have ondansetron IV before your chemo , along with a steroid .... def get a PICC ! You forget how much stuff goes down it and comes out of it , like having bloods taken before clinic every 3 weeks ....  Drink lots of fluids to flush all the chemo  through and give your kidneys a chance !  I'm not sure about supplements as some people say don't take as it interferes with chemo but others take them and are fine , prob best to check with your Onc.  Good luck !!",

      "Content": "Hi Smiffy  I started off private but only because I was going on holiday and wanted to know if it was cancer or a cyst ... I didn't want to cancel the holiday which would then alert my family to something being wrong. Private without insurance is very expensive. I had 3 X biopsies , mammogram and ultrasound scan plus meeting with the consultant and it cost around £3000. ( plus I'm in the medical profession so had some contacts that got me in the same day ! )The treatment will be exactly the same in the NHS , it may be a bit quicker privately ?? But there are strict timelines which most hospitals keep too. You may have a nice quiet room with posh candles when you have your chemo - some people can find this a bit isolating ..  I had my biopsy results back within 3 days but they were emailed to me at 11pm one night !! Quite a shock ! Fortunately I could interpret them but not a nice way to find out .. I then transfered to NHS . I had amazing treatment with the NHS in a large teaching hospital and my surgeon was excellent , as is my oncologist. Would I have gone private if I had insurance .... Maybe but I would of picked my surgeon and hospital very carefully. I would always go for a private wing within a NHS hospital too rather than a private hospital on its own because if something goes wrong you are invariably transferred back to NHS pronto  !!  You can of course do some private some NHS as long as your docs are okay with it as notes can go missing not get transferred etc etc.  Good luck with everything.  Xx",

Was on tamoxifen then swapped to anastrozole 9 months ago , bit of stiffness in knees and then last Sunday legs went a bit funny and hands became stiff. By Tuesday both thumbs locking and hands weak. Hard to get out of a chair but once I get going legs okay.still have symptoms today.  i have always taken TEVA apart from 1 month when I was given Accord. On accord I noticed legs / knees were stiffer. Now , here is the bit I am not sure of : I ran out of TEVA on Wednesday - I had 2 accord left so took them Thursday and Friday - back on TEVA - new pack - on Saturday. Thinking it was the new pack of TEVA I stopped taking them and have taken accord for last two days - but after thinking about it and realising drugs can stay in system for 10 days I now think could it of been the Accord! Confused yet ?!!  I am now not sure which brand has caused the side effects , do I keep going on TEVA or swap to a completely new brand.  Can you develop SE 9 months in on same brand ? Could I have had an off batch of the same brand ? Advice / opinions / experiences  welcome ! Thank you ! Ps took ages to type this with one finger !! Xxx",

My main problems this time ( there is always something ! .. ) have been a dreadful skin reaction to the sun and very sore soles of both feet. My face , despite wearing factor 50 and a baseball cap just turn red and cracked ! I looked like Nikki Lauder at one point. I was working outside and just overdid it. Today it is much better so I am spending the whole weekend inside to save my face. Then Monday I have got a wide brimmed hat to wear. My feet are another pain. They are so sore ! I have tried different shoes/ boots all week but nothing has helped. It's like walking on glass sometimes so I am resting my feet this weekend too. I have my 3rd of 4 T's on Friday , so a few more days of normality before the next hit.  My boss gave me a spa weekend voucher for two on Thursday at Ragdale Hall. He said I can't believe you are still coming into work ! I genuinely love my job and I love having cancer treatment free time amongst my friends who are so generous with their time and kind words but also treat me normal !! I'm not sure if I will be able to work all the way through , I've got 4 FEC after my T so I'm making the most of it. I am going to use my voucher in-between ending chemo and having surgery if I can. Ragdale Hall have several treatments approved for people with cancer or receiving chemo so lots of pampering to look forward to. I hope everyone is feeling okay in this heat. Spin Girl I'm so glad you managed to get transferred and you are being looked after. How wonderful that you can now spend some quality time with your Mum. x Ange , I've just seen that you shaved your head. Well done ! It is the one thing I have hated over everything. I hate wearing hats in this heat , I have found a few things I like but I'm still in search of the ultimate head gear ! It is very odd when you see your reflection and I know what you mean , all of a sudden I look like someone in one of those ads they play on TV in the day raising money for cancer research ! But we are not victims or sufferers we are fighters and as Amanda said - you are a warrioress ! Well I'm off to rub more cream into my cracked face. Sending lots of love and healing thoughts to you all.  When I feel really rubbish I remember that it is the chemo doing it's thing , killing those cancer cells and I'm one step closer to being cancer free. xx",

      "Content": "Hi Carol Just a quick note to say don't be worried about having a PICC line. After a while you don't really know it's there most of the time. Having it inserted is a little a uncomfortable but mainly only when the local goes in , after that I hardly felt a thing. I was given a form to give to my GP so he could write a prescription for a plastic sleeve to use when I shower. It works brilliantly. Chemo is bad enough without having needles every time and people searching for veins. Also if you are unwell and need bloods checking , or just going for your normal bloods check pre chemo - no hassle ! You do need to have it flushed and dressed once a week , I have a friend who does mine for me in my middle week , so if you know a nurse or someone who could be taught to do it that is an option rather than going to the hospital weekly. I was also offered a district nurse. Congratulations to your son and you ! How amazing that he got those results when he has obviously being thinking about you and what you're going through.  I have had my T course first. I liken it to flu. I had very achy legs and knees. Was a bit breathless after my first one but 2nd one wasn't too bad. You do feel quite hot , my hospital's cut off point is 38 degrees , but some are lower. I just try to keep cool and not overheat wrapping myself in blankets .. which I did the first time and I ended up having a visit to hospital ! By the time I got there my temp was back to normal but I had bloods taken anyway ( via my PICC ! ) and was sent home on antibiotics as a precaution. My main problem is thrush in my mouth which appears on day 4 so I now get fluconazole at clinic and take it straight away as soon as my tongue starts to turn ...... I have also had sore feet , soles of. My doc offered to lower my dose but I said I'd rather have the sore feet .. they are almost back to normal now. And my face was super sensitive to the sun and flared up dreadfully last week ! Lesson learnt and I now have a big hat and I used e45 to soothe and moisturise.  Loss of taste buds is a pain , again starts around day 4 , but they do return. I also get a good 2 weeks after my T so hopefully you will get the same. You may have had similiar on FEC , I've got my 4 FEC to come ! So much for the quick note ! I may have made it sound a bit bad but it is do-able and I still get up and shower every day , even if I only transfer from bed to sofa for a few days ! Good luck and enjoy celebrating your son's results. xx",

Has given me something to do which has been good as I know I have 4-5 days of not feeling like doing anything from Monday .... Re: antihistamine , piriton - generic name chlorphenamine , I took it when I had a dreadful rash from my antibiotics and again when my face flared up. Was okayed by the nurse on the end of the helpline when I rang about rash and stopped AB's. It can make you a little drowsy , which isn't a bad thing at night I guess. Great news to hear it helps with aches and pains from T , I'm going to do a little research I think and maybe a trial on myself !!  Hope everyone is managing ok and having some sort of a weekend. Jake how are you getting on ?",

      "Content": "Hi Everyone I'm off to the dentist today for a little check up , it was a appointment I made ages ago and he is happy to see me even though I'm having chemo. Going to see if he has any thrush battling ideas too as I find this is one of the worse side effects for me despite taking fluconazole. This time I took it on day 2 after chemo , I might take it on the day of chemo next round to see if that minimises it at all.  Jo , my nails are very tender , it's painful even to push tablets out of a wrapper ! But , they are all intact after 3 x T. I keep them short and use Sally Hansen nail and cuticle oil and they are looking good !  Skin still very sun sensitive so staying out of it this weekend t avoid it cracking .... ! One more T to go then I will be on my FEC and countdown to finishing chemo. Happy weekend everyone ! xx",

      "Content": "Hi Loulou It is all very scary but I found once the chemo started I felt much better about things. At least I was on the way and getting things moving. I am having T-FEC , so I'm having my Taxotere first. I have had 3 so far and it has been ok. Yes , it is a little miserable for a few days but I have at least 2 good weeks when I go back to work before my next session. I am getting more tired as time goes on so I am resting up much more. Everyone reacts so individually to chemo but you can guarantee there is someone on here that will be feeling how you feel or will have felt it and come out the otherside. That is the important thing to remember  , you will come out the other side. It is tough but we don't really have much of a choice !  There is lots of support here and it has helped me enormously. I'm sorry your family are not interested , are there any support groups in your area ?  Good luck and we are all here for you. xx",

      "Content": "Hi All Day 6 after 3rd T ( having T x 4 then FEC x 4 ) and have spent two days pretty much in bed. I think I just thought I need to rest and not do too much. I have to say not sure if I felt a little worse and depressed so I am up today and planning to go out. Plus lying in bed all day made my aches a little worse I think ! I found the first T was definitely the worse , my aches and pains which I get mainly in my knees and legs haven't been too bad for sessions 2 & 3 but I think psychologically it has started to get me down a bit more. I have one more T left  !! It just seems such a long haul at the moment but I know I will have a good 2 weeks next week. Birty - I had really sore feet after my 2nd T , I have always had a little tingling in my feet post chemo but this time it was like walking on glass. I was back at work and thought oh it's the boots I'm wearing but despite changing my shoes several times it continued. It eventually wore off after a week although was a little less each day. My doc said he would lower my dose if I wanted but if I could put up with it he'd leave it be.  SusieMB , I hope you're doing ok after your first FEC and are enjoying some normal days. Good luck to Fifi1716 and all having chemo today. xx",

      "Content": "Hi J Sounds like you are glad July is over , let's hope all will be ok this month. Being a baldie is the hardest for me , I dreamt I had hair last night ! I'm going back to work Monday and have an early start , I was counting back the time to when I need to get up and factored in washing my hair .... then realised I had none to wash ! Was a little sad but gives me more time in bed ! Regarding your wig , I had a free wig voucher, I wonder if different health authorities have different rules ? I haven't worn mine yet as I am convinced it looks like a wig ! ( which it does .. ) I really hope your next dose of chemo goes ok , just use these next few days to rest and recuperate. I have just had my 2nd dose of T, to be followed by FEC. I'm still getting to grips with everything and learn something new each time . I have struggled to find a squash I like to encourage me to drink more , trying different waters too as my taste buds are shot for the first week so everything tastes horrible. Makes it hard to drink 2 litres minimum ! I so wish I could have my old life back before all this happened , but I know I can't change anything and can only move forward. My last chemo will be end of November , that's a lot of chemo clubs .. then surgery for Christmas and rads in the new year so I will be here for a while , moan away ! I hope you're having a nice weekend. X",

      "Content": "Hi JakeB and Susie I hope you're first chemos went ok. It really is the worse in some ways as you don't know what to expect. I am having my T first , have my 3rd of 4 tomorrow , then I have 4 x Fec. I think you just have to rest , drink lots of fluids and know that the side effects won't last forever and you will feel better ! With T ( Taxotere / Docetaxel ) the side effects hit on Day 4 and last for about 5 days with me. Then I have a pretty normal 2 weeks although this time I have had sore soles of both feet and my skin was very sensitive to the sun , my face practically cracked !! Feet and face are both much better now ! I can't comment on Fec yet but from what I've read there is more nausea than with T. T tends to be very flu like, achy limbs , a bit breathless and a tendency to spike a temperature.  It all seems so daunting but there is so much information on here it really helped me prepare. So many people said chemo was do-able and they were right. It's not great and waiting to have my 3rd tomorrow  I'm thinking oh here we go again another few days of feeling crap but now I know it will be over in a few days and I can grab a bit of life back before the next hit ! You can both DO IT !!! X",

I was a little sore and stiff in my arm but started doing gentle exercises that night. It wasn't planned that I stay overnight but surgeon wanted to leave drain in until the morning. I had very little need for pain killers but think I had a good dose of morphine during surgery. I think as long as you are not feeling too sick and are wrapped up warm you'll be fine, will you have someone with you ? x",

I get really stiff in my joints , not sure if tamoxifen / lingering chemo after effects or just that I am a little overweight and a bit older !! I find exercise helps - as in walking nothing too strenuous and swimming . We have a small quiet warm pool locally which I find great to stretch out in. I have changed brands too. I was originally on - gosh can't remember - but I am now on Teva. I have found my joints much better. My knees were very painful , I was like an old lady getting off the sofa but now that has gone. Who knows if it is the different brand but it's definitely worth trying a few.  Wockhart !  That was my first brand. Good luck with it. I do feel a bit zapped of energy sometimes but as my friends keep saying - you've been through a lot , have another piece of cake. Hence the weight gain ! x",

      "Content": "Hi Carol I finished my chemo in November , I had a picc line and cannot recommend it enough. Yes it probably does make the nurses job easier but it makes the whole procedure for you easier , quicker and pain free once it's in , as long as you don't get an infection. All bloods are taken from it , drugs can be given down in , I never had one needle in me the whole 6 months I received treatment. You do have to have it flushed and re dressed every week which is a little time consuming but worth it. FEC can really damage your veins and therefore can cause problems later in your chemo when trying to find access. Chemo is pretty miserable but very do able. I think a picc line just makes it a little easier. Good luck. I am 6 weeks post chemo , still not quite back to normal and still bald but feel stronger every day.  I have surgery on 20th Jan , the chemo shunk my tumour considerably so I a having a lumpectomy as a day case.  Xx",

      "Content": "Hi Cheri I had 4 X docetaxol starting July last year , followed by 4 X FEC. I had treadful pain in my soles after the first , I could hardly walk but it did improve. I think the first couple of doses were a shock to the system ! I also have numb toes still - last chemo was 27th Nov -  I lost my big toe nail 2 weeks ago and my finger tips are also a little numb but have greatly improved. My onc did offer to lower the dose but said if I can put up with it he wouldn't. I chose to stick at the higher dose and ride out the SE. It does take an awful toll on your body. Try and drink as much as possible , I really struggled with fluids and had to force myself , everything just tasted horrible. I had surgery last week and I am finally starting to feel like myself again and I have hair !!! Phil Mitchell type hair but better than the big shiny bowling ball look I've sported for 7 months. Good luck , it's tough but you'll get through it.  Xx",

It is really hideous , I had my 2nd chemo today and I think the realisation that this is my life until at least next January is starting to sink in. I'm having chemo , surgery then radiotherapy. It is frightening , the unknown is even more frightening but we have to stay strong and fight it. We have to take inspiration from all the women on here who have beat cancer and who are successfully fighting it. Treatment these days is so advanced , they really know what they are doing and we must believe we are going to be ok. As I tell people my diagnosis nearly everyone has said , my Mum had it 20 years ago and she is fine , my sister had it and she is fine , I have two friends who had it and are now both fine. You are allowed to have bad days , you need to let it out so you can move forward , it will get easier. Is there anyone you can talk to , have you looked for a local support group or tried the Macmillan helpline ? I know many people here will help you through this too. Hang on in there. Karen. xx",
