    "Content": "Hi , after I have the FEC on the third day I have to inject myself in the stomach- I think this is the GSCF part of it, don't worry I was pretty put off by this but to be honest I have just finished my second course of the GSCF (you get a weeks worth of injections to take home with you) and when I inject myself now have to check the syringe to make sure that I have done it properly as don't even feel it any more..Â  good luck you'll be fine!",
