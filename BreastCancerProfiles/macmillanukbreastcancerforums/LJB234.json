      "Content": "Hi Freewheeling I had a Mastectomy & reconstruction with an implant last Oct. I was warned it might fail as I had Radiotherapy to that breast 16 years ago. Anyhow I had to try....all looked really good to begin with. I was elated with the result, but in January I developed an infection & the implant was removed. I was devastated at the time, but now I have got used to it & just put my jelly booby in my bra. I keep getting offered different reconstructions, but my Consultant said there is no guarantee it will work & 2 failures can be very traumatic. I think the decision is personal & everyone is different. Good luck Lisab xx",

      "Content": "Hi Jilly  I had a mastectomy & reconstruction with a silicon implant. The result looked fantastic, but one small end of the wound would not heal & this resulted in me having a major infection & emergency surgery to remove the implant 6 weeks ago. To say I was devastated is an understatement. I hated what I looked like, but six weeks on I have a prothesis & I am really happy with it. The lady who came to fit it was superb. We tried different shapes, sizes until the match was perfect. It fits snug inside my bra from Peacocks (without a pocket) & as time goes on my scar/flat chest is looking so much better. It's horrible just after surgery, but it does get better Lisab xx",

      "Content": "Hi Candytop, I was alerted to your post I think because I was in a dilema as to whether have Chemo or not a few weeks ago. It is a hard decision to make, but I have opted not to have Chemo. This was based on something the nurse said at my meeting. She said they had high risk patients who had refused Chemo & they had been fine & low risk patients who had Chemo & it had returned. It's hard to predict how each individual is going to react to treatment & but it has benefited a lot of people. I was lucky my results were good in my opinion. Had I had lymph node involvement I may have made another decision, but for now whether right or wrong (time will tell) I have declined.   I think the decision must come from what you think is best for you. I have had friends who have agreed with my decision & some who think I've lost the plot ha! Good luck Lisab xxx",

I have found if I massage moisturiser into my shoulder/upper arm before bed this helps & vaseline on the under arm scar as it's very tight. The only thing I do with the breast scar is gently wash it at the min. I can only have showers as we live in a Bungalow with just a shower cubicle, but oh how lovely it was to shower after 10 days so I can understand a bath must have been heaven. How did you get on with Chemo & how much did you have to have? Sorry I'm clueless on all of this ha! I'm not too bad today thank you (hope you are having a good day).

It seems the harder the journey the more information that person supplies. I'm 58 & my first tumour was treated with a lumpectomy & 4 weeks radiotherapy & for 16 years I thought that was it! 18 months ago I lost nearly 2 stone & was diagnosed with an overactive thyroid. This stabilised 3 months ago once I came off the medication. None of my tumours have shown on Mammograms I have found them by sheer luck - being small busted helps ha!

      "Content": "Hi Nicky You are my hero. You have been through so much. I couldn't stop thinking about you - getting on that train. I realise I am very lucky as my hospital is a 20 min drive away. I was taking Letrozole before the infection, but was told to stop this until I was healed....so I'm going to have another go this week. I took Tamoxifen for 4 years 2000-2004. So yes the senario still goes on eh! I was having anxiety attacks about going anywhere on my own, but on Saturday I got myself ready, took a deep breath & did a bit of clothes shopping. It was a good feeling to do something normal. I think the anxiety thing about work comes from all the trauma & I'm sure we are not on our own. I'm at the dentist today so that will be another hurdle lol  Lisab xxx",

      "Content": "Hi Nicky How kind of you to ask how the dentist went! I just went for a check up & clean (long overdue), but it was doing something normal again. I got chatting to the dentist's assistant & she had a Mastectomy 7 years ago & is doing well, so that was a boost. I just bought some new tops & a couple of chunky cardigans for work. I want to go back to work looking refreshed ha! Yep my 1st BC was in 2000 - lumpectomy & 4 weeks radiotherapy & I coped well, but I was 16 years younger lol! How are you doing today, hope it's a good one? Lisab xx",
