      "Content": "Hi Jules, I had an LD flap reconstruction last week (although with an implant too) and I think it looks great. I can't say if the boob is numb or not as I still in pain from the op but as to how it feels - it is firmer than a natural boob but does not feel hard. I also cannot say how it moves as I am still wearing the corset bra given to me by the hospital. You do end up with quite a large scar on your back and have to do exercises to retrain other muscles to take over but so far it has not caused me any real problems. At the moment I cannot lift my arm above my head but that will come back as the wounds heal and as long as I keep up the exercises. The worst part for me was having the drains removed, I found that very painful but once they were out it was fine. Make sure you have plenty of pain medication at home after the op as you will need it. I take Tramadol and Paracetamol & Codeine which allows me to have almost continuous pain medication. You will also need some sort of glucose syrup such as Lacutal to keep you regular while taking the meds. I will post regularly so you can see how my LD develops over the coming weeks/months to help you with your decision.",

      "Content": "First let me say sorry for not being around lately but I really did not feel like being on the computer as I found it uncomfortable to use a mouse and keyboard - but I am back LOL OK, where are we now......... It has been 8 weeks since my masectomy and LD reconstruction and the scars are healing well although I still have to be careful about lifting items, walking dogs on the lead etc. The main problem I had was serious sensitivity in all the skin surrounding the scars on my boob and back.  This caused problems wearing bras and I ended up changing bras 3 or 4 times a day so not the same area of skin was being affected. I tried various creams to no avail until this week when my lovely BC nurse told me to ask the GP for a cream called ELMA - oh my what wonderful stuff it is. It contains 2 anaesthetics (one of which is lidocaine) and you must wear gloves when using it or your hand goes numb LOL but it has made such an incredible difference.  It takes about an hour to start working and then lasts for about 2 hours which has allowed me to actually get out of the house with hubby for trips in the car (I was getting serious closing in walls feelings being stuck indoors). So, if you are feeling sore or sensitive on the skin around the scars (not the scars themselves) ask your BC nurse or GP about ELMA - it has made an incredible difference to me.",

      "Content": "Hi Lillylizzie, I had one breast removed with immediate reconstruction 8 weeks ago and yes its taken a few weeks to settle down and get used to it but for me it was exactly the right decision. I think a lot depends on what type of reconstruction they do (I had the LD flap) and to be honest apart from missing a nipple it does not look much different from the other one (except for the scars which will fade). I too can send you a photo if you want, I am very pleased with what my surgeon has done and feel so much better knowing the cancer has gone. Good luck and best wishes Lorna",

This boob feels like a complete alien and I am really starting to hate the sight of it, I can't move without it hurting and as for sleeping!!! well thats another matter.

As for the food, see if your partner (or a friend) can bring you in your supper each day so you get at least one good meal otherwise your haemoglobin will drop after the op and if they drop too much you may need a blood transfusion (mine dropped to 9.7 and I only just got away with not having a transfusion as I was going home where I would get good food LOL). I wish you luck with your LD flap MX and please let me know how you get on.",

      "Content": "Well, finally had my LD flap MX last Tuesday (14th) which all went very well apart from I did not have the morphine drip so was in a lot of pain. They eventually got an anaesthetist to come up and see me who prescribed regular morphine by mouth for 48 hours in addition to tramadol and co-codamol. Had my first drain out on the Wednesday which did not hurt at all (probably because of the morphine) but the other 2 drains taken out on Friday were so painful the room turned blue! I cannot fault the care I received, the nurses were awesome and my consultant came up every morning. I felt very cared for and was in a room of my own not in a ward which was much nicer. They ensured I got my pain relief on time every time and was kept comfortable. The only drawback was the food which was horrible :) My new breast is incredible, just the right size and shape (still painful at the moment though) and hubby has named it Bob (all new additions to the family get named and he says this is a new addition). I did find that the seam in the supplied corset bra irritated where the drains had been taken out but now I have added extra padding over the area it is calming down. Off to see my consultant this Friday (21st) so will update after that",

As you are going back for results today mention it to the consultant or BC nurse. They will be able to tell you if it is normal or not. Try not to worry and talk to your doctor about not sleeping. I have found mine very supportive in this situation and he prescribed diazipam which has helped me get through some of the tougher days. He also gave me a good supply of various painkillers (Tramadol, Paracetamol, Codeine) so I can mix and match to keep the pain at a level I can cope with. Don't suffer in silence, talk to your doctor, consultant, BC nurse - they are all there to help. Take care and good luck xxx",
