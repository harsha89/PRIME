      "Content": "Dear All, I never imagined  that I will join this group, but here I am! My mother had a diagnosis of BC 3 WKS ago. The latest CT scan shows it is Stage 3B. We are devistated as both me and my sister resides in the UK. My mum and dad lives abroad. My dad had only just recovered from a stroke. He suffered paralysis and me and my system travelen back and forth for this for a year. Now end of 2018 has brought this to us. I really want some guidance on two fronts.  1). What is the treatment timeline of stage 3 BC. Can please some share start to recovery how long it took. By recovery I mean perhaps last chemo or surgery where you then just take oral medication. I may be wrong about this ( still learning about all this)   2). My mother has no one to care for her. We want to get her treated in the UK and we want to evaluate the cost involved. I understand that it is not straight forward as if things go wrong the treatment can change drastically, also affecting the cost. But any guidance will be helpful. If you had private treatment please share your costs here so that I can start evaluating.  I appreciate all all the help and support.  Thank you, Amy x",
