      "Content": "Its the loveliest thing.. My 25 year old son did the same. He is a semi pro boxer and without even telling me had his last fight in aid of breast cancer, the support and money raised was incredible.. My son is one that never shows emotion, stiff upper lip etc so to find this out was a very special moment for me.. Xx",

      "Content": "Hi, I had a mastectomy in October, was kept in overnight as didn't take the anaesthetic too well, came home with a drain and lots of pain relief... Had to go back in 5 days later as I had blood clot so needed a second op... I was terrified first time, but not second time as I knew how well id been looked after.. Everyone was fantastic and made me feel so at ease.. I know its hard not to worry, we wouldn't be human if we didn't, but hope you feel bit more reassured by the positive replies... Just make sure you do your exercises they give you, they really do speed recovery.. Good luck and hugs",
