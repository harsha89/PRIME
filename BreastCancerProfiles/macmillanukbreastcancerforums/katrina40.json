Years of doing 'On Call' trained me into dealing with sleep deprivation and still function. Chemo tiredness seems completely different though. Sometime i feel like I could sleep for a week. I have to admit i dreaded going up the stairs to the ward today and almost burst into tears. Then gave myself a good kicking and thought well after this one only one left before suntan city. Even though i'm bald i just love Nina Simon's song Got life I think its called the one on the Muller adverts. I even put it on my headshave video. It always make me smile and know how lucky i am. Hope the 23rd goes well. I'l be thinking of you. Be strong and bellow out that song - maybe i'll see you on X factor one day. Katrina xx",

      "Content": "Hi all Just need to say i have just had my 4th cycle of chemo and got my self all fedup and really down about it. I have another 2 to go then radiotherapy. I think i made the mistake of looking to get halfway through and thought it would be plain sailing from there. The usual nausea followed after the 4th cycle and it kicked my back into reality. I had a few really good days before the cycle and was beginning to think about getting back to work and life in order again, now i'm not so sure. When i was initially diagnosed i was told it was high grade DCIS this turned out to have a high grade invasive triple negative BC component as well, thankfully lymph node neg. My eldest sister was recently diagnosed with DCIS for which she is due to have a mastectomy at the beginning of March. I haven't been able to tell her how i have been with the chemo, just in case she ends up in the same situation. She had a really tough time when she had to break the news to her children who are both in their twenties and were really unsupportive toward her. I found this really upsetting. I'm so fed up with trying to protect my friends, family and loved ones from how i really feel as i don't want them to worry, i'm fed up with the array of side effects throughout the whole cycle and just want to be normal again. I know i'm not my normal bubbly self inside though i'm trying to continue to appear myself as such. I often feel like crying at the drop of a hat at odd times for no apparant reason, other than being fed up. Is this what they mean when they say that it can affect you psychologically and emotionally. Have i now got to put up with this for the rest of the treament. Each cycle i have had so far seems to have brought a new side effect that has remained. Has anyone else experienced this. Can anyone offer any advice/suggestions. I just want to be myself again. I don't want to continue feeling fed up and cry at the slightest thing. The end of treatment seems so far away. Katrina",

      "Content": "Hi Teggielass It's good that we have the support of people to keep things in persepective for us, and yes it does feel like a mountain to climb, but i'm good at being an Emu and just try to take one day at a time. I know what you mean though about wanting yourlife back. I was hoping to get back to work whilst in the recovery period after thelast cycle and then workthrough the radiotherapy, however, having had a conversation with my line manager at work last week i am being told that they will arrange for my occupational health assessement after i have had radiotherapy. I can fully understand their view point, but i do find it frustrating that i am having to delay my return to work and hence delay getting my life back. I just hope they pass me as fit to return when they do the assessment. This cycle i have started to have night sweats, my periods have stopped, i'm getting wrinkles and basically think i'm having a bit of a menopause. Time will tell if it all reverts back to normal once the chemo is over, there are advantages and disadvantages on both angles. Thankfully my temperature is following the normal patterns, so i'm certain i have no infections brewing. I have been taking my temp at least twice a day. I know it sounds a bit over cautious but having had about a week in hospital after the first cycle due to a cold when i had neutropenia i don't want to repeat the experience. Thankfully since i started the injections although i'm certain i still get neutropenia it doesn't last for the whole cycle as it did the first time around. My tongue only gets little blisters for about 5 days now, which suggests that my neutrophils don't fall out the bottom of my boots for to long :-) It's a great reason to eat spoonfulls of honey as well. Wales sounds lovely with the snowdrops and daffodils. We have crocuses coming up here in yorkshire at the moment, and listening to the birds in the morning when i take the dog for a walk is a real joy. I often think about taking my camera with me to get a few shots, but i think the dog would grumble about having to stay in one place for long periods of time. I'm viewing the radiotherapy as sun tan sessions. It'll be the only time my boob get a sun tan! Using the old addage of what doesn't kill us makes us stronger. We will come through this experience all the better for it and a little more tanned! I'll send you lots of positive vibes to get your neutrophils up and doing their job, and i'll be thinking of you for your next two cycles and hoping the next two mountains seem easier to climb for you.  I'll be with you all the way. xx",

If i have had the menopauseat 41 i'll be thankfull that it will go after chemo has finished as i won't be having the tamoxifen or other drugs as they are not required for me. It sounds like there is a positive side to being a triple neg. I'll send you all my positive vibes to get you through the ho flushes to come in the future. mmmmm....Maybe i should enquire about osteoporosis if i am going through the menopause. Your right i do have a very supportive employer. I guess it has to be really as I work for the NHS. Although i have heard that some some NHS organisations are not as good and supportive as the one i work for. I'm sorry to hear about your work situation. I'm a great believer in everything happens for a reason, just sometimes that reason is not obvious until you get further down the road. Which ever route you take it will be for the better even if it feels worse to start with. They do say that cancer does make you reevaluate things, and it hasn't been until the last few weeks that i have been doing an evaluation of my life. I'm happy to say i feel on the right track job wise but have been able to see a few opportunities that i would not have considered had i not had cancer, and some i had considered but put on hold. As you say a rebirth, I'll be making sure that that i do those things i have been considering. I have only one life to live and so much living to squeeze into it! Roll on 5th cycle on thursday. Take care  Katrina xx",

This week my spongy mouth came back and the general feeling i usual get just after the treatment. I'm putting it down to the anxiety build up of the last one this friday.  I have got a friend to come with me to the last one, mainly to make sure I go through with it as I anticipate feeling like i did with the last one. I may not be able to force myself to go through with it this time, and it would be a shame to get this far then postpone it or not have it at all. The predominant thing I have had this time is my feel are constantly aching. It started just after cycle number 5 and hasn't really let up at all. Just the severity has changed with them aching so much it has been painful to walk. They feel like I've been on them constantly, but the truth is I am no where near as active as I normally am. I wonder what number 6 will bring? I look back now and wonder where all the time went, it does go bay quickly though at the time you're going through it, it doesn't feel like it some days. Keep being strong folks you will soon have your life back to normal again. Good luck for number 6 Teggielass, see you on the other side. Katrina",

      "Content": "Hi Lisa Thank you for your response. It has been a real help in getting things back in to perspective for me. I was really misearble and that is not like me at all. I'm normally the type of person that laughs at most things, even inappropriately. I was determined that postive thinking was going to get me through the chemo. I was expecting the 4th cycle to go better than it did, and the realisation that it was more of the same just got to much and i felt i had let my self down because my positive thinking wasn't strong enough. You are right i now have two left and that makes it more bearable. I'm already planning for a spa session with my pals to celebrate the end of treatment. It's good to know that radiotherapy will be a comparative breeze. I can manage the time constraints as long as i don't feel ill and it doesn't stop me from doing what i want to do, when i want to do it. I'm used to living life in the fast lane and haven't really been able to adjust to well to the slower pace determined by chemo. I'm fortunate in that i don't live to far from the hospital and i'm hopeful that i could go to the appointments from work, assuming i'm back at work by then. I agree with the therapeutic effects of crying in the shower and not having many eyelashes also helps to explain why my eyes are sometimes red. I will get through this and get my old life back. I am working on getting my fitness back ready for the Jane Tomlinson 10K i've signed up to do in August. I have one more question about memory - mine has been appauling lately. Do you now if it recovers it's former glory after chemo. I have tried the usual reciting things and writing them down. Reciting things works if i don't have to do it fo to long. If i write things down I forget where i have put the piece of paper, unless i hang on to the paper, which ineveitably i don't as i either forget why i'm holding on to it or think it'll be fine and i'll remember - which i don't. It this an insight in to the world of alzehiemers.....I really hope i don't get that.   I am feeling much better today and once again thanks for your response it really did help get me back on track.

      "Content": "Hi Susan Thanks for your response. In hindsight i should have concentrated on getting through the 4th cycle rather than getting half way. This would have prevented me from getting so down at the 4th cycle. I'm feeling more like my old self now and i'm actually looking forward to getting the next two out of the way. I think, like you i will be punching the air i may even do a jig. I'll just have to remember not to have a big slap up meal to celebrate until the recovery period is over :-)  I have pickup the college course i was doing when i was initially diagnosed but let slip. I now feel i have renewed vigour to get it completed before i finish my treatment and return to full time work. I can also use it to easy myself back into work mode so that when i do return i shouldn't take to long to be up and running at full speed again.  My husband is very good he seems to know how i feel without me having to say to much and we have just decided about our summer holiday.  I have spoken to my pals at work. They have been really great, and we are all planning a spa session in April to celebrate the end of treatment and my return to work. I have had brilliant support from my friends on the other side of the world. My dad has been fantastic and if i don't phone him at least once a week he phones me. I do temper what i say to him though as i know he will worry himself silly about me. This must be bringing back so many memories for him of my mum who died of breast cancer 16 years ago . He would see so many similarities between the two cases if he know all the details. I have spoken to  my eldest sister, albeit it quiet modestly, who i was really worried about, as she goes for a mastectomy at the start of March. I don't want to give her any news that might sway any decissions she may have to make about any follow up treatment she may have to have. I would like to report i have had support from my other three sisters but they have not been in touch at all since just i had my first operation. None of the three have mentioned anything about me having breast cancer. I get the distinct feeling that they really don't care, which is fine. The saying is true that its times like these you really do find out who you can depend on. I was not surprised with their reaction. Its a long and complicated story. Suffice to say you can pick your friends but not your family. I'm certainly not going to lose sleep over them, life is much simpler without them. It's their loss. Your analogy is right about it being like a prison - not that i have ever been there,  but i can imagine. I does feel like i've been very restricted and thats where my frustrations have come from. I used to living the fast life doing what i want when i what etc, Chemo certainly does put the handcuffs on. Thankfully i'm learning how to pick the locks and have discovered that if i sleep when i need it then i will have far more energy to do what i want, than i would if i try to battle through regardless. The only thing i can say is, when i get my life back to normal watch out world I have a lot of catching up to do and only a life time to do it in! Thanks again Katrina x",

I asked the nurse about the tiredness and she warned me that it will probably get worse. Not really what i wanted to hear. I'll end up sleeping in between meals at this rate. Hope i can stay awake long enough oto get back from the treatment tomorrow. Its at 1:15pm ;-), so if anyone has a bucket load of energy send it my way for tomorrow please. I even cancelled coffee with my work pals in favour of going to bed, which i did when i got back from my appointment, well by bed i mean slept on the sofa with the dog and woke just in time to take him for his walk. Guess i'm really learning how to sleep at the moment. Roll on tomorrow night when the steroids kick in again and give me sometime awake :-) Almost there  now! Katrina xx",

      "Content": "Hi Moleend Sorry to hear of your recurrence. I am also new to the site. I had a similar decision to make - chemo or not. Having a  14mm triple negative grade 3 cancer with only 1.8mm and invasiveness, nodes negative. (stage 1) I will be undergoing radiotherapy regardless. I was told if i didn't have chemo there would be a 23% chance of recurrence in the next 5 years, with chemo it would be reduced to 10%. It seemed a bit of a no brainer to me as there were no other options available such as hormone therapy or herceptin. 13% decrease seemed significant to me. I decided to take whatever they want to offer and do everything i can to work with teams. I can understand your dilema, buti think you need to discuss this further with your care teamand find out what the immunology of this lump is. What receptors does it have and what do they really mean. Also what is the grade and what does this comprise of. You may want to enquire about the mitotic rate (this indicates how quickly the cells can divide), tubule formation (indicates its ability to develope its own blood supply) and pleomorphism (how much like the cell of orgin it looks like) There may be number used for each of these that make up the overall grade, dependant on the grading system your pathologist has used. This information may help you make the decission right for you. You may also want to enquire about a ca15.3 blood test if you haven't already had one done. Hope this helps. Good luck & i hope it all goes well for you. Katrina",

Yes it's no great ride in the park but it's manageable. Just take each day as it comes. I found it helpful to keep a diary to monitor side effects, temperature, feelings etc. Also keep your team up to date with any side effects. They can do things to help minimise these. If you have any worries at any time get in touch with your nurse contact, she will be able to help talk things through no matter how silly you may think your concern is. The time will go by quickly and you'll get to the end of it and wonder where the time went. You may also want to have a look at the other forums 'FEC chemo' and 'had fist chemo fec what else to come' Take care and hope everything goes well. Katrina xx",

      "Content": "Hi All Good to see this thread. I was diagnosed with grade 3 triple neg in September after initial thinking i had got away really lucky with DCIS. October saw sentinel nodes which were negative and a choice of chemo or not. I did my research before i met up with the oncologist so i had pretty much made up my mind which way i would go dependant on a few questions i had. Although i only had a small amount of invasive cancer i still opted for the chemotherapy route to reduce the chance of recurrence. There seems to be some debate on whether or not chemo is effective at reducing recurrence but i didn't want to get a few years down the line and then wish i had taken the opportunity because the cancer returned. Maybe because i wantedto believe my oncologist i took the figure he gave me. He was very good and went through using a software package called adjuvant. The radiotherapy was a given- i will have that anyway, after chemo. I am due to have my fourth cycle of EC this week. I have to say it is going pretty well so far apart from tiredness. I have yet to see a complete film on the TV during the evening, and i need to have an afternoon nap. All completely alien to me as I'm used to being up at 5:30 in the gym at 6:30 and work till 5:30 before getting home and starting all over again with the usual household jobs and seeing to the dog. My first cycle was the worst for nausea and abdominal tenderness, but i really didn't appreciate what they really meant by 'small' meals. The size of meal that i found i could get away with in the first week is enough to go on a side plate. If that helps any. I have a good supply of ginger chews which are made by the ginger people but i ordered a supply from Mark Shaw of World Food Brands - he was really helpful. I eat these to help settle any mild nausea and also keep my mouth from being dry as this was another thing i encountered. I also notice some dry skin in some places and found E45 cream and emoillent shower cream really useful and soothing. I didn't worry about losing my hair as i shaved it all of for charity before it started to fall out. Does anyone know if there is a greater chance of triple neg having any genetic links?",

I have just got an appointment through for a genetics session. My mum had breast cancer before they knew about different receptors and my eldest sister was diagnosed with hormone receptive BC in december. I am thankful that they did not find any node involvement in mine, but you are right it can be hard not to worry. I think one of the reasons for this is that there is no additional back up treatment (hormones or herceptin) available as yet for triple negatives. It does seem like it will be along time, but you will be throughout and out the other side in next to no time. Just be good to yourself  and rest when you need to. You will get sick of hearing the term 'listen to your body' but it's wise words. Waiting times are always the hardest. Like Susan i am now doing everything i can to get on with my life. I start back at work in two weeks time and will deal with the genetics issues as they arise. Does the hospital where you attend have anyone that is interested specifically in triple negative breast cancer? I know there are some consultants in the UK that have an interest in triple negatives. Those that work at centres which participate in cancer research projects also share knowledge on a national and international level so may also link in to those in America. They are just not as good at publicising it over here. As Susan says the American site is good and you may find some of the information helpful. Be careful when reading things on the internet in respect of research papers etc as you may scare yourself silly. You may find it useful to take articles etc with you to consultations. Your oncologist may also appreciate it too. Take care, Kat x",

      "Content": "Hi Penibear Sorry you have had to join us here, but you're in a good place now to get support and info.  Like Susan says you do have to tell them exactly what you expect and your concerns.  Is you breast care nurse approachable? She may be a good contact to voice all your questions with to start of with. Make a list of them and take them along with you.  I was also told mine was probably not genetic as my mum also died of breast cancer, aged 58, however they have referred me to he genetics team, partly due to my age (40 at diagnosis) and the fact i had a triple negative cancer. This decision has since been further supported as my eldest sister has recently undergone surgery for breast cancer as well. Having said that, it is worth bearing in mind that only about 3% of breast cancers are linked to genetics. Though this does not stop one thinking that someone has to be in that 3% and not knowing if you are included in that figure can play on your mind. Perhaps if you could speak to a genetics counsellor it may help to put things in perspective for you, and also speak with the surgeon/oncology team again to get more information about the prognosis before you go for more surgery. Some questions that may help you get the information you need may be: What type were the tumours? What receptors did they have? What is the staging of the cancer? Is there vascular invasion? Why did you not have to have radiotherapy? Thought you probably didn't have this due to having a mastectomy. Did you have good clear margins? Ask about the actual size of the lumps and the amount of margins. They should be able to go through all of these with you and even have access to a software package (Adjuvant online) that can help with the prognostic information. Don't worry about taking up their time, you need information to help you both now and in the future. Keep asking questions until you get the information you want and can be happy with any decision you make knowing that you will have no regrets at some point in the future. It will also help your care team to understand your reasons for making any decision you make. Good luck. Kat xx  ",

I'm having lots of fun making them all gossip :-) Someone suggested wearing a stoking on my head under my wig if it irritated. It certainly felt comfortable enough to do that when I had hair but I haven't tried it since. I  have to admit I have a really comfortable NHS wig. Did you also know that if you buy another wig you are entitled to it VAT free. You may need to produce proof of your original Wig form and complete something in the shop, but it's worth that savings. I was also given a tip about using fabric conditioner rather than the specialist wig products which are more expensive.  ",

I also opted to have my head shaved and did it for charity. It was really exhilarating and made the whole hair loss thing feel worth while. I am now 10 weeks post completion of all treatment and waiting for my hair to grow back. It is doing so, it just feels like it takes soooo long. This web link was posted in one of the other forums. hairinrecovery.com   On the plus side i had no leg or arm pit hair to worry about shaving. Have had to start doing that again recently though. Stick in there. The time will go by quicker than you think. Love Kat",

      "Content": "Hi Fiona I am on EC. I have my fourth cycle on 21st Jan. Was sick for the first day only but had a very tender stomanch for about a week. which i blame my self for. I had to big a meal and i think i put extra stress on my liver. I since have a lot smaller portions but more of them to prevent weight loss, and maintain energy. I ended up with a cold during my first cycle that coincided with my white count dipping, which was a godsend in a way as it was hit and miss if they would recover in time for the next cycle. They did fortuately, but the consultant added in a injection to stimulate my white cells which i now inject the day after chemo and thankfully i've never had a problem since. My tongue becomes senstive to hot things, so if i have a cup ot tea i have to let it go almost cold before i can drink it.  I do get a sore tongue which starts around day 7 and will last for about a week or so. This is indicative of the neutrophil count (the white blood cell that fights bacteria) being low. So i know it still drops low but it has never been low for as long since i started the additional injection. Mouth hygiene is vitally important as bacteria can easily cross the mucous membranes. I feel like i am always brushing my teeth. I also rinse my mouth with water after brushing my teeth to prevent the toothpaste causing irritations. They did suggest salt water but i tried that years ago when i had my wisdom teeth out and it spoilt my food. If it does get to bad i can ask for mouth washes, which i haven't had so far. I have bonjela if i get the odd mouth ulcer. Its worth it for the taste alone if you like licorice. I didn't use the cold cap as i had a head shave for charity, but the stubble did all come out more or less all at the same time around day 14. I would not recommend having a bath around that time. Stick to a shower. I had a bath to try to relax and it ended up looking like i was bathing in my husbands shaving water. I have to say i feel i have had it relatively easy so far but have had something new and different, not neccessarily worse, with each cycle to add the the list. View it as a great adventure with many challenges ahead. The body is a fantastic thing with the way it can adapt to new situation. The only other advice i can offer is if you have a personal aim of getting half way make it the goal to get through the 4th cycle. Then you only have two left and you're home and dry. Remember whatever side effect you have, the ward will probably have something they can give you. Good luck Katrina xx",

      "Content": "Hi Bev and all Welcome Chrissi. - You may want to check out what benefits you will be entitled too should you have to use all your sick leave. Remember although it is good to work your health is far more important. It's good that you can work from home, i have done the same on a few occasions, though i'm officially of on sick leave. Are there any other steroids they can give you if the current ones are causing so much indigestion?  I would recommend using lashing of E45 cream for the dry skin. They should be able to give you it at the oncology unit. I had the same thing and it seemed to get progressively worse over time and i was given Dermol before the last cycle. You may also notice you develop wrinkles, i did, again this is due to the skin being dry. If you don't fancy using E45 on your face there are others that can be used, ask at your local boots, debehams or other similar beauty counters, The ladies there volunteer their time to do the Look Good, Feel Better sessions and will be able to advise the best products to use during chemo. If possible, book on to a session. Its well worth it and you'll get a great goodie bag to take home. Is there any particular food that triggers the indigestion. I found i had to stay away from anything spicy, pickled or citrus. Bev - Thankfully i didn't have the F bit of the FEC. I'll keep my fingers crossed that you don't lose your nails. I'm not sure how i would have coped with that one, i fainted once when i bend a nail back. Shame  that halloween has gone, think of the fun to be had on that score ;-) I'm glad to say i adjusted quiet well to the loss of eyelashes. Now i'm facing the prospect of shaving my legs and arm pits again now i've had my last cycle. There were some good sides to the chemo. The Dr gave me a course of B6 tablets that started just before my last cycle, apparently it can help reduce some of the side effects in some people. I'm still taking them now. I can't say i feel any less tired but my throat doesn't feel as clogged up, my mouth hasn't been as spongy and so far i haven't had the usual sore tongue. My feet still ache but not as bad as they did on round 5 and my back aches more but maybe this is accumulatory sitting around to much. Thinking of you all. Katrina xx  ",

      "Content": "Hi All There is a move to get the national screening age down to 47. However, even this wouldn't have helped me. There is a balance to be made as mammograms aren't themselves without risk, however small. The reasoning around the age being 50 was due to the increased risk of breast cancer in the over 50's, and cost would obviously play a part as with any national screening program. It is known that younger women have more dense breast tissue but that is why they perform ultrasound screening as well as mammogram. There are also other techniques that can be used to assist screening in required situations. Like you Chrissi, mine was only discovered as an incidental. The lump i went to the GP with was found to be a benign fibroadenoma of about 2.3cm. They found a smaller lump in the other breast that was the malignant pest. I'm so lucky i went when i did. Consequently now i've had chemo the fibroadenoma seems to have gone, after it being there for a considerable amount of time, I didn't go straight to the GP when i first found it and probably just as well otherwise i may not have been detected at all, if the malignant one formed afterward. Regarding follow up, i have been told i will have a mammogram about 8 weeks after completion of my treatment then yearly for 10 years. This will then take me in to the national screening program age bracket. There will be a level of follow up for others, but the timescales may alter dependant on individual circumstances. Its worth questioning your surgical/oncology team, you shouldn't have to pay for private mammograms whilst you are under the followup care period. Thinking of you all. Keep up the fight xx  ",

      "Content": "Hi all Firstly welcome to all the new members. Teggielass - Yeah we got through the chemo. You're right about it feeling like the best christmas present in the world. I start radiotherapy next week. I'm not really looking forward to it as i'm not known for being able to sit or lie still for very long. Waiting for Dr to call me back regarding taking supplements and using gels etc in addition to the cream they will give me. Following my last cycle i have now lost all inclination to eat. I think it's probably due to now feeling that i don't have to eat being past the first week of recovery. It seems odd as whilst in the midst of chemo the prevention of nausea seemed to push me to eat small and often. Whereas now, i'm past the first week post treatment i don't have a reason to eat and i don't even feel hungry. I do cook and eat a meal when my husband comes home for his evening meal or when i'm with friends, but other than that i really can't be bothered with food and have absolutely no interest in it. I guess you could say i've turned into a social eater. I drink plenty of teas, squash and fruit juices. Maybe this is what other people have meant when they say the weight will come of again quickly after chemo, not that i out any on though. Cheadle - I know exactly what you meant about talking to close relatives and even friends about treatment. You're over half way now so almost done. You'll be through it quicker than you think. Andrea - The TNM is the staging your doctor has given you but as you say she has not explained it. It stands for Tumour, Node Metastasis. The T relates to the tumour size, the N is the level of nodes involved and the M refers to spread elsewhere.  Your lymph nodes are grouped in levels depending how close they are to the breast area. Here is a link that you may find useful.  www.cancerhelp.org.uk/type/breast-cancer//treatment/tnm-breast-cancer-staging You are not alone in feeling anxious about the first cycle, we have all been there, and it really man not be as bad as you anticipate. Try some relaxation techniques before hand this may help calm you down in preparation. I used to view the drugs as fruit juices providing lots of vitamins and minerals to help my body. Forion - My eyelashes thinned an i ended up with very small ones. I guess these were the ones that managed to regrow between each cycle. My eyebrows also thinned dramatically to the point that i didn't realise how much until i drew them back on again, but they never fully disappeared. Hat - I use oat milk 'Oatly' on cereal, i usually have porridge or bran flakes, so  wouldn't now if it alters the taste of other cereals. I don't use it in tea or coffee, i stick to normal milk for that as it seems to take so much to get it to the right colour that it ends up cold. They even do it in chocolate flavour and you can get it with added calcium. I tried some rice milks but found that to oily for my liking. Katie - Like Hat i'm shocked at the lack of heat pads and more shocked at the use of a radiator, especially with the health and safety implications. This is something that needs bring to the attention of those higher up. Try expressing your concerns to the staff on the ward. You may find they will be happy to provide you with a contact to write to. Sometimes the only way staff can get the things they needs to make improvements for patients, is for the patients to make complaints, as staff requests are sometimes ignored by those with the authority to approve purchases of equipment etc. If you do put your concern in writing i would suggest you also give a copy to the staff on the ward as well to show you are trying to support their any requests they have already made or will make in the future. Keep smiling everyone, enjoy the good days and remember them when you're having a not so good day. Kat xx",

      "Content": "Hi Chrissi I monitor my temp regularly anyway so i have a base line if it starts to drift up or down. I take the relaxed attitude as say what the heck and get out there and try to carry on as normal. I view the cancer as an inconvenience and it has caused far to much already for me without forcing me to stay indoors as well. The limiting factor i find is the tiredness. I would alway carry my thermometer just in case i felt a bit flush or chilled just to check. Thankfully i have been fine. Having experienced a neutropenic fever during the first cycle i knew what to look out for should it happen again. I am more vigilant regarding any infections. e.g. coughing up green phlegm and unusually warm, sore or swollen parts of the body. I also carry some wet wipes as well just in case i feel the need to eat, of just need clean hands and there is no where available to wash them. Writing that has just made me realise i sound like i suffer OCD. I don't really - honest. (i blame my laboratory back ground)  Another thing i did was avoid anyone coughing and spluttering by walking in the opposite direction or taking a longer route round the shop. Also making sure i don't put my hands near my mouth when i've been out and about without first cleaning them, to prevent transfer of bugs. I am always amazed at how many people go to the loo and don't think to wash their hands after. They then go and touch door handles, bar snacks etc. Don't get me wrong, i'm not a clean freak, but i am normally vigilant regarding hygiene and my low immune point just makes me more vigilant. This approach seems to have got me through all the cycles excluding the first one with no further need for IV antibiotics. I think the first blip was due to encountering a cold just before i commenced chemotherapy. Kat",

      "Content": "Hi Its good to hear your being so positive. Keep it up. I to had a sore veing following my 2nd chemo, (I've just had my fifth so i'm almost thorugh it) I mentioned this to my adjvuvant specialist nurse. She gave me some exercises which really do help on their own, I was also prescribed some Hiruoid gel, it contains heparin and anticoagulant so you will need to discuss the use of it. That together with the exercises have been great and i'm still able to have the chemo in the same vein. I use the gel when it feels sore and i also put it on a few hours before a chemo session to help it flow in better. I did notice after i had my head shaved just how warm your hair keeps your head. I can only add to this that what ever stubble you have even when you have it shaved to a 0 setting it keeps your head warmer than being totally bald. Keep those woolly hats on! A fews other things i have picked up in my journey you may/may not want to try, I have ice cream or ice-lollies post chemo and for a few days after to help chill my mounth in a similar way to the cold cap for hair loss. I won't say it stops your mouth getting sore or spongy later, but i feel it has reduced the length i time i have to suffer it. I appreciate there may also be other things at play there. I have also discovered lavender in my pillow case. Either as a lavender sachet or lavender essential oil. I normally have a few sleepless nights following chemo, but have found with the lavender, i get a pretty good nights sleep. I'm hoping this may help balance things out so once the 'insomnia stage' passes i won't feel so tired. The only thing to be aware of here is that lavender is known to cause sleepyness, so i do just confine it to the bedroom. Keep postive, Hope it keeps going well for you all Katrina x  ",

      "Content": "Hi Everyone You all seem to be doing so well. Keep it up. It is a tough ride, but we can all get through this. Don't beat yourselves up about putting on weight. I have spoken to a number of folk who tellme they had the same thing but once the treatment finished the weight came off again fairly quickly. The important thing is to just concentrate on taking each day as it comes. Emotions....yes i have had them. Though i managed to get to cycle 4 before i burst in to tears whilst walking the dog around the local park. I must havelooked a right sight ;-) I'm not sure if it is entirely down the the steroids. It can also be down to the fact that the chemo messes up the hormones and mentral cycle as well, so no wonder we feel tearful, have hot flushes and crave for alsorts of foods. Time will tell if it has put me in to permentnant menopasue or just temporary. There areplus points on bth sides but i kindof hopeits permenant as i don't fancy going through the rigmoral of that again now i know what it like. Some of the effects of chemo are accumulative for somepeople. The toughie is thateveryone is unique and we will all have our own little pecularities with this. I have found i am getting more tired as the treatment progresses. From speaking to my lovely chemo nurse, she tells me this can be expected and may well get worse. As for other side effects i have the usual basic bag of them, that occur at known time scales and each cycle seems to have brought a new one in to play. Cycle 1 neutropenic and infections (thankfully i don't get the infections now fingers crossed i make it to the end without another one) Cycle 2 Constipation transgressing to diarrohoea Cycle 3 mouth ulcers Cycle 4 emotions running riot Cycle 5 menopausal Cycle 6 ? 5th March time to celebrate!!! Thankfully the mouth ulcers have calmed down, but the other items seem to be still present, though they ok, maybe i have just got used to them being part of the challenge. Take each day as it comes and don't plan what you are going to do until you get out of bed on that day and see how you feel. If you don't feel like doing somethings it will wait will you do, or get someone else to do it for you. Its good that we are all here for each other. Take care and keep up the fight!",

      "Content": "Hi Oldhat and everyone. Sorry for the delaying responding. I had my last cycle on Friday, so spent a bit of time psyching myself up for it. Needless to say i decided to have a little joke with them on the ward that kind of backfired. It was a little hit and miss as to whether i would get the treatment. At my reassessment they weren't sure if i was coming down with an infection. Anyway they allowed it to go ahead if i was happy to. You can guess my answer, after the build up there was no way i was going to postpone. I told them i was going to create mayhem as it was my last one and didn't intend every going through the process again. Needless to say when they put the canular in for the last time i had a vasovagal attack. It did smart a little bit as they had trouble finding a vein big enough, then the saline going in was so cold it sent me feeling sick. I did create a bit of hassle for them out came the oxygen, and BP kit etc Dr in attendance as BP dropped very low, heat and lungs checked. Eventually i came back round fine with no problems but had to wait for BP to come back up before they would give the chemo. I had two heat pads, instead of the usual one, to cover my arm all the way around including the canular site and make sure it was nice and warm and they put everything in nice and slow with lots of breaks to allow for flushing. i was sure glad when it was all done i found myself counting the mL of the last syringe to go in. I had a lovely bath that night to celebrate and ended up crying in the bath hoping it was all worth it.  I'm feeling much better now just have the wobbly days to go through and sleepless nights due to the steroid, though a bit o lavender oil on my pillow seems to help. My neutropenia really didn't worry me to much. I just had to make sure that everything was very clean and made sure that anyone wanting to visit had no germs. I think my blase attitude comes from my pathology background - To many years of working in the labs.  Oldhat - let me know the time you'll be at the Haven and i'll meet you there for a drink on 16th. I try to get to Leeds on Tuesday to go in to work and have a catchup with the team. I say coffee, but i have to admit i have gone right of it since i started chemo. I love nettle tea and others like peppermint and chamomile as they feel more gentle. One thing we have to remember is that because of the amount of information out there any Dr we see will have their own view on tinges and this may be dependant on the information they have ready up about as well. Katie 54 - i had the same thing happen to me with typing then seemingly losing the info. Try clicking the forward button if it happens again. It worked for me. Until i found that i was copying the typing every few minutes incase i lost it again. Really don't worry to much about the inches you gain, they will come back of again once treatment is finished. So hold of buying another outfit, you may yet get away with the one you have. Forion - have you mentioned your dry skin and itching to your care team, they should be able to give you something for it. I was started on E45 cream but at my last reassessment was also given  Dermol lotion as the skin on my feet was peeling and they were very red and hot. It worked a real treat. I noticed that areas itched just before the hair fell out. Thankfully i still have a few eyebrows but most of my eyelashes have gone. They are now just stubby little ones left so no mascara for me yet. I did try some false ones to try to offer my eyes a bit of protection from grit etc, but could get away with the feeling the gave me being stuck on my eyelids, it was worse than having none so gave it up as a bad job. May be i just couldn't get them on right due to not haven gym glasses on to see what i was supposed to be doing. Did you see the article in the Sunday express yesterday regarding a professor in Australia - he thinks he has found a cure, linked with the immune system. it was very interesting. Bev51 - I'm just on EC chemo. I got strange headachy feelings from tie to time and i think it was linked in with tiredness. I used to get the same type of thing when worked in the lab all day followed by a night on call and work the following day. You could try having an additional nap it may help. I like to eat ice lollies to as i fin it helps as does pineapple juice, going on this theory i pick ice lollies with pineapple juice included thinking that there will be greater relief. Delmonte fruitiness are on offer at the moment. :-) Old hat - have you mentioned bladder irritation to your care team? I make sure i have at least 2 litres water following chemo treatment, regardless of time of treatment. I figure that as i will probably be awake anyway during the night i might as well get the kidneys flushing and bladder emptied to help reduce any irritation. In addition i have nettle tea as this is supposed to be good for kidney function. It does have a strange grassy smell, but is ok to drink. The chemo programs are tailored to the individual and take account of  age, stage, grade, likelihood of recurrence, other health considerations. I think there may also be a degree of clinician preference to certain drugs as well. Some chemo programs may not work a second time as the body may built up resistance so i guess thats where the clinicians preferences come into play. They like to keep an insurance policy for further treatment should it be required. Like you OldHat i am on just EC, or should i now say was. I am 41, 40 when diagnosed and started chemo for my 41st birthday. Who says the NHS doesn't acknowledge your birthdays? I am premenopausal or was - but not sure about that now, as things stopped in that region after my 3rd cycle of EC, I was stage 1 grade 3 triple negative, sentinel nodes neg. The original lump was 16mm comprising 14mm Comedo necrosis DCIS and 2mm invasive grade 3 tumour. I had good clearance margins and was offered chemo to reduce chances of recurrence, as it would have been about 25% chance recurrence without chemo of 10% with chemo. I grabbed the offer with both hands and given the same situation again i would not alter my decision. Hi Delilah - Welcome to the group. I'm sure you'll find it very supportive here and very informative. It's an interesting question about your body taking longer to repair itself whilst on chemo. Io would guess that it depends on the type of repair required and cells involved as the chemo affect the rapidly growing cells which includes some healthy cells as well as the cancer cells. I'll keep rooting for you all. I'm now on the recovery stage of my last cycle before heading of to the suntan city of radiotherapy. I wonder if i can persuade them to give me bows for tattoos instead of dots? Be strong everyone and take each day as it comes you will get through it. Remember to listen to your body - it really is worth it!      ",

      "Content": "Hi All Hope you are all doing well and feeling strong. Yes i know it's some ungodly hour of the morning but hey, I'm making the most of the side effects of the steroids. There are some benefits like being able to check emails etc with no one around to constantly ask questions, and no dog to come wanting a fuss :-) Delilah - How are you? I hope it wasn't as bad as you were anticipating. Keep the faith you will get through it.  Oldhat & Bev - its odd how you should say about lumpy boobs, Both my sister and myself have always had lumpy ones and both ended up with breast cancer. i guess it just makes it more difficult to recognise what is normal, especially if the lumpiness alters during the monthly cycle. Best not to dwell on what could have been Oldhat, it has been caught now and you will come out the other end a stronger person for the experience. Cherub - I can support Oldhat in the Ginger additives. I also got a stack load of ginger chews from the ginger people. They really worked for keeping the nausea away and also helped to keep my mouth and throat moist. Though you may want to also get GinGins a milder form of the ginger sweet if you have spells when your mouth does get sensitive. Also mention to your care team that you are having the sickness and nausea, they may be able to change then to some that do work better for you - remember we are all unique in our own way and not everyone responds to the same things. I think my last day was an accumulation of reluctant anticipation mixed with the fact that my veins were finally starting to say they had enough, not to mention the fact that i'd made a joke to the staff about being awkward - i guess my body decided it was going to have the last laugh. I did have a similar experience when had to have steriotactic biopsies on one side following the usual FNA biopsies on the other boob. With the steriotactic ones it was like having your breast in a mini vice and not being able to move as there was a needle going in and out to remover numerous bits of tissue as it was all automated and done under xray conditions. Then it was just the heat and anxiety that got me on that one not to mention the length of time it seemed to take. I have my suntan planning session tomorrow with an estimated start date of 25th March. Life finally feels like it is starting to get back to normal. I had an interview today for a job i am interested in. It felt good to be doing something other than sitting waiting for the next hospital appointment. I did the best i could, now i will just wait and see if i was successful - but hey cancer really puts things in perspective, if i don't get offered the job its not the end of the world - it just wasn't meant to be . I also attending a 'Look Good, Feel Better' session. I highly recommend it to every one. I came away with a lovely goodie bag filled with all sorts of quality cosmetics and a new face. I didn't realise how much the chemo had altered my appearance until today. I guess because it was partly gradually you don't notice the changes occuring. i realised i had lost more eyebrows than i thought, but after the session i felt fantastic, i had them back. It was so good to have the make up ladies on hand to show us how to apply make up to get our faces back to a resemblance of normality. Check out if there is one near you and get booked on it - It is well worth going, and if your feeling able to eat that day arrange to have a meal with friends, family, whoever just to top of the session and finish on a real high. Be good when you can be and be naughty when you want. ;-)  ",

      "Content": "Hi Jodie I'm sorry to hear about your mum, but you are with a good support network here for yourself and all connected. Your mums' white cell count - The doctors may want to start to give her an injection 24hours following chemotherapy to stimulate the white cell count. It's the neutrophils that will probably be low, these are the ones that fight bacterial infections. If the doctors don't offer it ask about granulate stimulating injections, but confirm with them first that it is the neutrophil count that is low. I wouldn't suggest taking any supplements with out first checking with the oncology team as there may be interactions  that could reduce the efficacy of the chemotherapy. I have looked into using Life Mel honey myself but although the research - very limited though it is suggests it will be useful,  i feel it is insufficient to guarantee that it will not interact with the chemotherapy. This is due in part to the bees being fed on herbs etc that would normal reduce the effectiveness of the drugs. I can not find any information to suggest that the compounds in the herbs that affect the chemotherapy do not pass into the honey. If the active compounds do pass in to the honey it would suggest to me that the chemotherapy would also be affected, but as i say i can not find sufficient evidence on either side to support the claims the Life Mel honey company give of helping prevent neutropenia in chemotherapy without it affecting the chemotherapy itself. Do you have a Breast Cancer Have near to where your mum lives. If not look them up on the internet they can provide support and relaxation therapies which your mum may find beneficial. There are also other avenues you can explore such as contacting your local macmillan centre, there may be one in the hospital your mum attends. These also offer a range of complimentary therapies which are really good to help relaxation. Alternatively you may be able to access them via your local hospice, but your mum may need a referral to here from her care team. Don't be frightened by the term hospice they are no longer deemed as places purely for the terminally ill. I have tried reflexology, aromatherapy, reiki, and massage - body and hand and feet, not to mention an indian head massage. They may also offer colour analysis where by they will identify which colours clothing and makeup best suit your mum, and may even give her a mini makeover and it can be a bit of fun too. Also checkout a 'Look Good, Feel Better' session for you mum. These are fantastic. See my earlier post. I'm sure she will really enjoy a session of that. Hope you find this helpful. Take care and i hope all goes well. Katrina x",

      "Content": "Hi Bev I only had EC, but i gather it's the tax that may cause nail loss. You may want to enquire about the use of mitts and socks to help prevent this. I'm not sure if these are chilled like the cold cap as i don't know how the tax works or why the nails should fall off. It may be a question worth asking.  If it is the circulation around the nail beds that cause the nail loss perhaps they can offer something like nail cooling if they don't have mitts and socks available. If the interaction is as someone suggested in another forum i think due to the sunlight then using dark nail polish to help prevent the nail loss as they suggested may work as well. I know what you mean about feeling normal, i went to a tool fair on friday with my husband - he really knows how to show me a good time ;-) We only spent a couple of hours there and it was great to get out somewhere different, but i slept for longer than i was out when i got back. Keep smiling - it makes people wonder what you've been unto. Hope everything goes ok.  ",

      "Content": "Hi All Hope you're all doing fine and still smiling. Paula - You're very welcome to join here, you'll find lots of support when your down and lots of interesting information when you most need it.  I had to have my arm in hot water every time - I think it's routine for them to do this as it helps gets the veins dilated and easier to insert the canular. Its also worth drinking plenty following the chemo - The downside of that being that you could spend all night running to the loo to empty your bladder. Think of it as saving yourself from a session at the gym. :-) Cherub - I was always congested and feeling like i constantly had the remnants of a cold. It was starting to finally go earlier this week, however since getting head-butted by my dog (purely accidental) yesterday morning followed by a nose bleed it seems to be back with vengeance, probably more due to the swelling rather that the chemo. Jules - I hope you have good news about your MRI next month. Have you been offered genetic screening? Would you want it? Chrissi - My head normally got itchy just before the hair shed. Though i have to say i don't seem to have lost much following the 5th cycle. I'll wait and see if it fallout now i've have cycle number 6. My periods stopped just after the Chemo nurse enquired about them at the pre assessment for cycle number 3 and haven't yet returned. I had been regular as clockwork till then. I'm kind o flopping they don't bother to return and i can also get away with no more hot flushes once the chemo is fully out of my system. I won't even have to worry about getting them with hormone treatment  as i won't be on that. Bev - I  also found cold fresh cucumber on my eyes very soothing as long as i could keep the dog from trying to eat it. I also used the opportunity to relax and have a bit of me time. Hat - Thank you for the lovely compliements. It was great to see you on Tuesday. You looked really well. I'm going to stock up on aloe vera gel. I hope your blood test was good news and that you'll be ok with chemo number 3 tomorrow. Anytime you want to meet for another drink just let me know. Its good that you found the nutritionist useful. I found her information very useful to with regards to getting things prepared for the constant grazing, which i also found helped keep the nausea away.  Katie - There are other sugar replacements available for your sweet tooth. Xylitol. I think it is sold as 'Perfect sweet' and i am told it is very sweet so you don't need as much, it also has a lower glucose index than normal sugar so won't cause as big a peaks and troughs in the blood sugar. It may help to wean you of the sugar. I know they sell it in the supermarkets normally near the sugar or in the 'free from' aisles dependant on supermarket. Be warned though it is a lot more expensive than sugar - another good reason why you won't want to use a lot of it.  If you've been given exercises for your veins keep them up. If you haven't been shown any - ask your care team. The veins will eventually free up with the gel and exercises. If this is what drug users experience i can't imagine why they would want to continue injecting for fun.  Good luck to everyone having their next treatment and hope your blood tests are all fine with good white cell counts. - Stay positive each day is a step closer to completion. xx    ",

      "Content": "Hi All There is a move to get the national screening age down to 47. However, even this wouldn't have helped me. There is a balance to be made as mammograms aren't themselves without risk, however small. The reasoning around the age being 50 was due to the increased risk of breast cancer in the over 50's, and cost would obviously play a part as with any national screening program. It is known that younger women have more dense breast tissue but that is why they perform ultrasound screening as well as mammogram. There are also other techniques that can be used to assist screening in required situations. Like you Chrissi, mine was only discovered as an incidental. The lump i went to the GP with was found to be a benign fibroadenoma of about 2.3cm. They found a smaller lump in the other breast that was the malignant pest. I'm so lucky i went when i did. Consequently now i've had chemo the fibroadenoma seems to have gone, after it being there for a considerable amount of time, I didn't go straight to the GP when i first found it and probably just as well otherwise i may not have been detected at all, if the malignant one formed afterward. Regarding follow up, i have been told i will have a mammogram about 8 weeks after completion of my treatment then yearly for 10 years. This will then take me in to the national screening program age bracket. There will be a level of follow up for others, but the timescales may alter dependant on individual circumstances. Its worth questioning your surgical/oncology team, you shouldn't have to pay for private mammograms whilst you are under the followup care period. Thinking of you all. Keep up the fight xx  ",

      "Content": "HI Everyone. Hope you've all had a pretty good weekend. Andrea, Chrissi - I know what you mean about not feeling ill. I guess thats why they call cancer the silent killer. You often don't really know anything is wrong until you do start to feel ill and then it is much harder to treat. That's the advantage of good screening programmes.  Hat - sorry you were feeling low. I hope you felt better for having had a visit from your daughter. I don't really agree with your Macmillan nurse. I feel i have got away with relatively few side effects. I think people that visit sites such as these are looking for information to equip themselves. How they use this information can be in a  number of ways, whether it is to ask questions at their next appointment or just to know how to deal with some side effects and the fact that they are not the only one going through it. I wasn't told i would have accelerated wrinkle formation and end up looking like i have the neck or a tortoise. Thankfully lashings of moisturiser and an extra thick layer of it at bed time seems to have reversed them. I guess they have a short amount of time to assess how you will react to information hay have and therefore may have to temper it down to prevent panicking some patients. Personally i work better if i have all the information good and bad, but not everyone wants that or can deal with it. If sharing my information and lessons learnt helps others deal with their challenges than i feel my contributions are worthwhile, regardless of what i get from the activity. After all how many chemo nurses and Doctors have actually gone through this type of process. I think those that have, will have a much better understanding of the needs of their patients, which they gained from first hand experience and wouldn't dismiss the benefits forums and sites such as this provide. I agree with you Noj regarding those short sighted folk. Do i sound as ranty as you? Likewise we do have to remember that the number of people visiting these sites for information etc is only a small percentage of the total figure of people actually affected by cancer. Remembering this should help us keep things in perspective and stop us panicking about side effects that may not affect us all. I understand they do have photos involving mastectomies etc available but you have to ask to see them. I think it should perhaps be the other way around where they offer them for viewing and you can then decide if you want to see them or not.  Great news about your white cell count. One thing to bear in mind about blood results is that the reference ranges given, (these are the list of figures usually on the right and will appear something like 11.5-18.5g/dl) are just that. They may or may not be specific for a chemotherapy patient dependant on how the laboratory IT systems are set up and the location itself. For example a laboratory in a specialised cancer unit may have a range more relevant to the chemotherapy patient than a laboratory in a district general hospital covering a wide ranges of conditions. It is alway worth asking for clarification on what their target is in respect of results. What one consultant may be happy to work with another may not be. Fiona - I'd not heard about liquorice being good for mouth ulcers, but as i love it anyway i used the constipation relief as a good excuse to eat plenty of it during my chemo. One precautionary angle you ladies may want to consider is that it can increase your blood pressure. My scar both from the Lymph nodes and lumpectomy are both looking pretty good since i started using loads of moisturiser on them. I use E45 and you can get it on prescription. You may want to try that before buying the more expensive ones. Hope you enjoyed the cinema. Josie - Sorry to hear you had an unpleasant first cycle. I felt very down after my 4th cycle and much like yourself couldn't really put it down to anything in particular, and it started a couple of hours after i had the treatment. I found myself in floods of tears whilst walking the dog. Thankfully i was in the middle of the woods so no one was around to see this mad tearful woman balling her eyes out. I was glad not to have anyone around and confined any further tears to the shower. A few days later i felt much better and have to say i haven't been that down since. A good fitting on the cold cap should help keep the loss to  a minimum. i.e make sure it is in close contact with your head all over. Hair- I still have some of my down stairs, though it is significantly thinner. My leg hairs are none existent as is my under arms - great no shaving required, though i suspect this will alter soon, as i have now finished my chemo. My nose hairs were the first to disappear. Strange how you don't notice how much your nose runs until you have no hairs to catch the drips. I now have a hazy fuzz regrowing on my head and i'm hoping that it will stay this time. The next few days will tell. Either way if it does shed again it will be the last time. Louise - Was there a reason why you decided to have a routine mammogram at the age of 40? How easy did you find this to request? Have you got any family history that supported your request? Chrissi - maybe we should swap dogs. I'm normally the one creeping around at 2 and 4 am with the dog making his feelings known by sighing and huffing loudly at the fact i'm disturbing his sleep. I took my wig to my hairdresser who styles and trimmed it to make it look more natural, and i have to say  she did a cracking job. When i do where it, which is only occasionally people that don't known have commented on how good my hair looks. i kind o f figured on keeping my wigs for when i'm having a bad hair day and con't be pestered doing anything with my own hair...what do you reckon. It could also come in handy for fancy dress parties. It sounds like you have a very good GP. I know what you mean about work. I wanted to get back to work ASAP and have had days when i feel i could have worked. Though i also admit i would have forced myself in to work on the days i haven't felt so good. Fortunately for me i have a very good employer that has put me on full pay until i return. They have told me to take the time of to complete my treatment before i consider returning. Thankfully as i can work from home i have been able to dip in and out as i have felt like it so i can feel normal by doing some work as well as keep up with progress and developments that are occurring. Katie - Like you i'm not a great one for taking pills and potions. I helped myself by considering it was magic fruit juices they were giving me IV. The advantage of the red face is that everyone thinks you look really healthy, probably at the time when you feel most c**p. Since i started chemo i just don't really seem to be able to face alcohol. OK i admit that i have had a total of three mackinson shandies, but i have had to be in the mood for them, almost like my body telling me thats what it wanted. Generally i stick to pineapple juice or at times when they don't serve this lime and soda water. Chrissi - I'm with you on the in-law angle. There's only really one of them i have any time for. My own family - well i won't go into that but out of 4 sisters only one has bothered to contact me since my diagnosis and stayed in touch. I haven't heard anything from the others. What goes round comes round i say. You can pick your friends but not your family. I start my radiotherapy this week. I'm so glad i did my exercises and get the mobility back into it. I just hope i can stay still for the duration of the treatment. I have been told both verbally and on my consent form i may experience some tiredness, and some burning to the skin as well as oozing. But like all warnings they give this, only happens to a small percentage so i'll probably be fine. They have to let you know the horrible stuff incase it happens to you and you then decide to sue because they didn't warn you in the first instance. Keep thinking happy thoughts for the week ahead.

Teggielass - I hope you're feeling much better now and you got to do your retail therapy. I still have the slugs i the back of my throat and i'm now 3 weeks after my last cycle. If i was having another one it would be now. I know what you mean about feeling grotty. I can't say i had a really good day after the last cycle, but i haven't had any really bad days either. I generally felt drained through out the last cycle and my temp was doing the proverbial yoyo. No obvious signs of any infections though. And i have bumped the thermostat up at home as i have been feeling the cold a bit more, more like i did during the first three cycles, with the exception that i only need two jumpers this time and not three. My head now looks like it has a dirty fuzzy haze to it and is very messy looking. A mucky easter chick here you could say! I can't wait for it to get longer. For those having radio after the chemo it really doesn't take that long at all. I didn't have to lay still for as long as i expected. The majority of the time was taken by getting me lined up for them to join the dots. The actual sunbed session was about 2 mins each angle if that. (or thats what it felt like). It seemed to be over in a flash. I'm only having radio to my breast so i don't know if it will differ for those that may need it to the lymph nodes as well. No sore sensations or anything after the first session. Not sure if this will be accumulatory like the chemo. I was given some cream to apply twice a day and advised to store it in the fridge for added soothing effect if i do start to get some soreness. Apparently it will be a bit like sunburn if i get it. Everyone is different so here's hoping i get through with no burning or anything else. Take care everyone,  Kat xx  ",

By small i mean snack size and i listen to my body as to what it wants,  it'susually something healthy like a small salad, but has been chocolate cravings which lasted about a week though this wasn't til the second week after chemo. I have also had spells of bursting in to tears for no reason that i could explain. See it as a release. It's just the way the body deals with what is happening. Let them flow and feel good for it afterward. Thinking of you all in this journey. Katrina xx",

      "Content": "Losing your hair is a big step and can take a bit of getting used to but it does come. Something i did notice was that my hair changed texture before it started to come out. It went straw like, and although i had my head shaved it did start to thin before it was shaved. The thinning started within a few days of the chemo. A massive advantage is i no longer have to shave my legs or arm pits or spend time on a morning blow drying my hair. The neighbours are also starting to talk about the other  my husband brings home. I have two wigs, one like my own hair the other completely different and even confuses my husband if we go out shopping.  I have to admit though i only wear them when i go out somewhere to meet up with friends etc choosing instead to stick to hats, or even a head band when i go to the gym and if people stare it's their problem not mine. When we go for a meal i'm always tempeted to ask for a bowl of water then whip my wig off just so i can have a laugh at the look of shock on their faces. I know they appear natural as i have been stopped a few times by hair people in shopping centres wanting to shown me what i can do with my hair. This has been entertaining when i tell them it a wig, i've even had to lift it just to prove it. Another side effect i get is the feeling of being on a ship. This can be quiet entertaining as i wobble my way around the local supermarket on shopping days. It keeps the other shoppers guessing which side of the aisle i'll walk on. I always try to look for at least one thing every day that will give me a little chuckle, and i never go anywhere without my lipgloss, my hair yes, especially if it is raining, but never my lipgloss.",

      "Content": "Hi All Firstly welcome Wendy, sorry you have to join us but you will find this a great place to get lots of support and advice. I to am triple neg. Just thought i would update everyone on my progress. I am due to have my last chemo this friday. Hurray i have almost made it. Though since i almost didn't go to the last one i decided to get a friend to accompany me to this next one. It would be a shame to back out so close to the end. I always view the drugs as strawberry juice, mainly because the epirubicin is the same colour and i love strawberries so i think of it in that light rather than chemicals or anything that will make me feel awful. All my friends and family also keep saying to me after my third chemo i was half way there. In hind sight i think i would have coped much better if i had concentrated on getting two thirds of the way, instead of half way. I had a real downer after the 4th cycle as it hit me i still had the same amount to go through. I too have had dizzy spells, and get them with each cycle. I got fed up of wobbling my way around the supermarket however much i laughed about how funny i must have looked i decided to say enough, and i now do my supermarket shopping online - what a fab invention, i don't even have to carry it up the drive! It would be worth asking if you could have a full blood count test to help put your mind at rest that you are not anaemic. And if you are anaemic t gives them the opportunity to do something about it. The chemotherapy affects fast growing cells and blood cells fall into this category. My neutrophils always fall through my boots around day 7 and thanks to a granulocyte stimulating injection they start to come back up about 6 days later.  It is possible that the chemotherapy also affects the red cells as these are produced in the same area that the neutrophils are i.e. the bone marrow. I would be very cautious about taking herbal remedies, supplements etc and check these out with your oncologist, before you stat to take them. The one supplement you may want to avoid are ones that are high in antioxidants, they may protect against developing cancer and help in other ways but they also protect cells against destruction and that protection can also extend to any cancer cells that the chemotherapy is trying to destroy. After all why put ourselves through all of this to end up protecting the one thing we want rid of. I can also recommend having complimentary therapies at the Haven. They also offer nutritional advice. The one i attend in Leeds is great as they also advise on things i need to enquire about myself. If you don't have access to a haven then there are also hospices which are not just for the terminally ill. They offer similar things to the Haven, there are also macmillan centres which offer similar things to. See what is available in your area and try out various things to suit your needs. I find that i do need a little sleep mid day from time to time. It really is a case of listening to your body and hear what it is saying to you. If you want to eat chocolate, have a little bit, if you need to sleep, have a nap. Don't worry if you lose your memory - it will come back. For me every cycle has brought something new and a predominant problem. The latest one being that my feet constantly ache. I feel like i used to feel after doing a couple of days on call when i would be working constantly, even though i'm not working at the moment and certainly not doing the amount of exercise or walking that i used to. I wonder what number 6 will bring? Katie - I use the hirudoid gel when my arm feels sore and tight as well as the exercises and massage techniques my Chemo nurse showed me. My arm hasn't got any worse over the cycles but i do have sessions where i use the gel between cycles as it does seem to start to get sore for no reason. I also use the gel the day of my treatment before i go for the infusion. The theory behind this being that the gel contains heparin which is an anticoagulant - it slows the clotting mechanism of the blood making it flow better through the veins, so when the drugs are infused the blood will carry them away from the site more quickly preventing them from sitting in the vein too long and causing further irritation. Keep strong. I'm thinking of you all    ",

      "Content": "Hi Oldhat Morna Murphy is the nutritionist at Leeds, she is very good and has always suggested i check any advice she offers with my oncology team before i take any supplements. I agree the Haven is very pink, a colour i used to be very anti, but it's slowly growing on me. It's beaten me into submission i think. With regards to the granulocyte injection, that was partly as a result of the nadir count (for those that don't know, the nadir count is the lowest point blood cells reach during the chemo cycle). My neutrophil count went low for to long. Th injection itself has to be 24hours following treatment. The first time a district nurse came round to administer it, but i got him to show me and my husband how to do it and now my husband has that little task to do for me. To give you the full story as it will highlight a few things as to why we need to be very vigilant. On day 7 post treatment my temperature went up slightly to 38.1 but came back down an hour later to normal. I had a few sessions of feeling cold prior to this but not shivering. That night in bed i woke feeling very wet, but not hot and not cold. I didn't take my temperature as it was 3am and i really didn't fancy a trip to Leeds at that time of night if it was abnormal - silly i know. Anyway i woke the following morning feeling quiet well. I blew my nose and noticed that the mucus had a green tinge, a sign of infection. I phoned the ward due to being on chemo and the fact that colds have a tendency to go to my chest being asthmatic, and i really didn't want to risk that and the potential of things to get very nasty very quickly. Anyway i was told to report to the ward ASAP with an overnight bag just in case. They were fantastic, i had a full blood count sample taken and i was sent for an x-ray whilst waiting for the results. Which came back with a low neutrophil count, and i was on the wrong side of the slope. Anyway they admitted me and put me on IV antibiotics for a few days. During all this time i really did not feel unwell. They did daily bood counts to check my neutrophils which were still falling. The green mucus cleared quickly and they agreed to let me go home the following week but only if i promised to call them immediately regardless of the time of day or night and go straight back in should feel unwell or my temperature went up. I was happy to do this as i was in isolation and felt a bit like a caged animal after 5 days. The consultant also told me at that point that he was going to prescribe an injection to try to prevent it being so sever in the future. Which i have to say has worked. My neutrophils do still drop, the little blisters i get on my tongue around day 7 tell me that, together with my haematology knowledge, but it doesn't last anywhere near as long as it did the first cycle.  I had to attend the consultant clinic prior to my next cycle of chemo and had a few blood tests that week to check the neutrophils. It was looking like the treatment may have to be postponed as the levels were not coming back up to quickly. I attended early for my treatment as planned but had to have a blood test before hand with the possibility it may not go ahead. Thankfully all my positive thought that i put into mobilising my neutrophils paid off and they just scrapped past the magic number to allow the treatment to go ahead. I have to say I think I have a fantastic oncology team looking after me, they are really on the ball and are very good at resolving any concerns I have. But don't get me wrong if I thought they weren't looking after me they would know about it. I swapped surgeons because I didn't have confidence in the first one. Drop me line if you have any more questions or just want to chat. I'd be happy to meet for a coffee sometime to if you wish. Take care everyone. Katrina xx    ",

      "Content": "Hi All I hope you all got spoilt rotten for mothers day. Sorry to hear your chemo was delays Oldhat, - certainly ask for a printout of your white count, they should give you it or at least let you copy it down. Don't worry about being a nuisance. It can be very empowering to understand your blood results. I always ask to see mine. On one occasion I have even managed to spot something which the nurse missed that meant i needed to have another blood test before i could have the chemo infusion. Having said that i have the advantage that it is my speciality. I hope your keyboard survived it's ginger wash. Reading all these posts makes me realise how lucky i am to have such a good team behind me. Any questions i have regarding nutrition, exercise etc they seem to be able to answer. Cherub i hope you manage to get your chemo this week. I know how frustrating it can be. You don't look forward to the chemo but just want it all over and done with. The body will sort it's white count out in due course. It may sound a bit wacky but when i was in that situation following the first cycle i used a bit of visualisation. I don't know if it worked but i had a few blood tests in the week leading up to the second treatment including one on the morning of treatment to determine if it could go ahead. Thankfully it was fine. The Breast cancer Haven taught me how to do the visualisation bit and i have used it for other things to. One thing i would suggest caution with on the food side is bananas. They are high in potassium. If your potassium is nigh on the blood results they may request another test before the chemo is given. This is because a high potassium level may cause heart problems.  Bev - You will love the Look good feel better session. Good on you doing the race for life to. I did that last year and really enjoyed it. So much that i have signed up for the Jane Tomlinson York 10k at the start of August. I can now look at dusting of my running shoes in ernest. I have tried to eel it up over the past few months but it has been difficult on some days. I'll check out the web site you gave to get my attire sorted too :-) Forion - you are so lucky to be able to drink coffee etc. That was the one thing that i really couldn't face. Thankfully it is now getting better and i have managed a coffee today. With no more chemo to face and just radiotherapy to go through i hopeful i can start having my morning coffee again. Katie - Tiredness is an accumulatory affect,  but i found even having a 15min nap can help that side of things. I also found my memory got really bad as did my ability to concentrate on things, so i never really planned things, i would just see how i felt when i woke up in the morning and if it was a good day i could do assorts go things, if it wasn't so good i'd just take it easy.  Thinking of you all - keep strong you're doing so well it will be over in a flash.  ",

      "Content": "Hi All They say laughter is the best medicine and i figure it's true. I usually find the tie i'm most vulnerable to catching a cold is when i feel down. If i can laugh i can laugh it off. So keep laughing everyone hard as it may be at times. Bev - i know exactly how you feel. I felt the same after my fourth and couldn't understand it, after all i was over half way. I finally put it down to the fact that i had built myself up so much to getting half way that when i had the fourth it was kind of a let down and a reality check that although i'd made it through 3 cycles the fourth treatment was the start of the next three and in effect i had it to do all over again. It will get better from here on as you are doing so well and you are nearing the last one. It will come around quicker than you think. Chrissi - I'm don't often have colds either, normally one a year but like you when i get them they go straight to my chest and upset my asthma. Thankfully we are entering the warmer weather so there shouldn't be to many people wandering around now with colds. As you progress through your cycles you will start to relax more with regards to other peoples infections. The only advice i can offer is don't get to paranoid about it but know the signs for your own body and if you do become worried that your coming down with something let your care team know straight away regardless of the time of day or night.  One other thing that i noticed was that i get a cattarhiness following my treatments. I think this is due to the cylcophosphamide drug. It starts about a week after and last for at least a week. This time it has lasted for two weeks but i think thats due to my urge to eat chocolate (dairy food).  To help cut this down the cattarh i normally reduce my dairy intake an even cut it out completely when it has been to bad. Unfortunately the chocolate urge is winning this time. Normally I don't have due to my asthma (milk in tea and coffee and a yoghurt on the odd day). Dairy is known to be an agent that increases mucus production. On the issue of nails - mine did become more brittle and have a lovely tiger stripe pattern in white and pink. The white seems to coincide with the treatments. I have heard that eating jelly cubes can help strengthen nails. Lou - Its really lucky that you took the opportunity to have a mammogram. You must have a guardian angel looking after you. I feel so lucky to have gone to my GP when i did to. I was going to postpone it as my step son was in Afghanistan at the time, but something kept nagging away at me telling me to go as if i left things till his return things might not be so good. Odd really as i kind of knew the lump i was going with was ok. It was just a fibroadenoma, strangely enough the chemo seems to have made it shrink to almost nothing, as well as mopping up any stray cells from the lump the clinic found that i didn't know i had. I love the turkey thoughts. I'll remember that when i go to see the geneticist and have the test for the BRCA gene. I know i'll end up chuckling if the test comes back as positive as i know what will be in store.  You'd be surprised at how quickly the body can adapt. I'm now almost three weeks post last cycle and i now have a lovely fussy outline to my head where my hair is growing back. It seems i have managed to keep it this cycle. I'm tentatively starting to celebrate getting a bit of a covering ready for easter. First radiotherapy tomorrow. I have to admit to being a little anxious about it, more because of the potential effects and the fact i have to lay still for what will feel like an eternity. I'm bound to cough because of this catarrh. I have my aloe vera gel at the ready. Keep laughing every one. Kat xx",

After having had prolonged neutrpenai follwing my first cycle of chemo, (my count came back into range in the nick of time for me to have my second cycle) i am now on GCSF to prevent a recurrent of the neutropenia, but i was wondering if use of Life Mel would be useful to take to prevent the reduction in other blood cells. I have found some research that suggest there maybe some use but there is not a lot or evidence to support this claim. I am also concerned that the herbs from which the bees collect the pollen are themselves not compatile with chemo as the reduce the effectiveness of the drugs. Does the process of honey making metabolise out this effect? Can anone provide more information or research they have come across?",

It does appear to prevent neutropenia but does that also relate to reducing the efficacy of the chemo. I guess i really need an Apiary specialist to understand how the bees process nectar to honey and what components remain active and which don't and thus any possible interactions with the chemo from the nectar collected form the herbs. I'm happy to give it a go at any cost as long as its not at the cost of the reducing the efficacy of the chemo on the cancer cells.",
