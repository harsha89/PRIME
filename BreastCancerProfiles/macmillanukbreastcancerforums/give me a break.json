      "Content": "Hi  Dorothee . Reading your post gave me shivers as I am fighting Breast Cancer and I have been threw such stress with family . I ask all my family to give me some space as I had my surgery and chemo without them even coming to see me . Then they all decided to crowd me and I found it started to make me fell very low . Well you would think I was the most evil person as I have not seen them or spoke to them now 18mths on . And as you said if they cannot understand that I needed space it is there loss .Also my mum admitted to one day after my chemo that she didnt love me the same as 7 siblings . Thanks Mum eh . I am such a stronger person thanks to there ignorance , sending you allmy love x",

I am a Breast Cancer fighter I had right mastectomy lymph nodes removed  chemo and radio .I am on Tamoxifen and the swets are so bad day and night . It is so hard to deal with and im at my wits end with them . They took my womb and overies so I went into false menapause at 40 . I bought a chillow pillow of the internet it helps a little to cool my head down . If you do find any thing I would love to hear from you . Also you should put as much cream on your skin as possible for the radio. I used Aqueous cream and I still do when I had my Radio I used it 8 times a day and never had any affects from the radio . Good luck x",
