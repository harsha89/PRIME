    "Content": "Hello, I experienced a similar blockage. It appeared on the tip, off center, a few months ago, when I began more rigorous exercise.  I also began using vitamin E on my breast to reduce stretch marks. When the white speck appeared, I immediately thought that it was a pore blockage. It grew a bit over the next few months, not by much, to 1 or 1.5 mm. I finally got tired of it and squeezed it like a white head. A white fatty substance came out, just like a clogged pore would, except a little whiter. Over the next few weeks, it grew a bit again, this time developing a bit of a black head. I squeezed that using sterile bath tissue and the black head and a tiny bit of the same white fatty/thick substance came out with it. The pore looked perfectly normal after that.  Then a few weeks later, the white thick plug came back and it came to the surface after my bath tonight. Tiny amount, like from a clogged pore on my face.  The heat may have opened the pore and expunged the fatty plug. There is no pain, no change in appearance of the nipple, nothing suspicious.  I'll keep the pore clean and see it that will keep the fatty plug from coming back. I don't suspect that it's anything serious but I wanted to contribute my experience in this thread. Obviously I'm curious, which is why I'm here. I'm 43. Have 2 kids.  CC",
