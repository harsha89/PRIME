      "Content": "Thank you for your responses - it seems that it is down to the surgeon then?  There is no hard and fast rules.  I've been told my BMI needs to be 25 which means about 4 stone loss for me - it'll need to be done a year after my mastectomy as well and be considered just cosmetic surgery - which I understand to an extent.  I've seen picture on line of women who are around the same size as me having had it so again assume this is down to the surgeon or perhaps the hospital - surely it's better to be a little overweight so you have some abdominal fat to use?  I've called the breast care team to see what is happening as I'm waiting to see a surgeon to make a decision - but if it's down to the individual surgeons then a years time it could all change again?? ",

Cancer clinic sent me to the gp as I shouldn't be having these now but the gp didn't seem to understand chemo or side effects and was quite unhelpful Any advice gratefully received",
