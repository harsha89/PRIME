      "Content": "Yes, I also have chemo curls, I lost nearly all my hair but the two patches on top which didn't fall out (I did shave those bits) are still straight. Lots of curls at the back and sides, looks a bit bizarre at the minute but hoping it will improve as it gets longer. I always wonder if people are thinking I had it cut like this intentionally! Feel like I need a sign that says 'chemo head!' jakki x",

      "Content": "Hi Medussa, Go you and welcome to the rock chicks world! I shaved my hair after 3rd chemo and, like you, wear scarves, hats and bandanas out, I am happy to go bare headed indoors though. I bought a wig but have only worn it once as I find it hot and uncomfortable but I know people at the hospital wear them and get on fine, they look amazing! Think it's down to personal preference but I would advise getting only one and trying it out for a bit. I nearly bought two but the man in the shop advised me not to, so glad I didn't! Good luck with the treatment and stay positive Jakki xx",
