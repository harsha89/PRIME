About 4 weeks ago I was given the news that my breast cancer has gone secondary and has metastasis in the brain...more than 6 is all I know atm....I have had Radiotherapy and am on steroids. I am so puffed up that I'm struggling to move, is this normal on steroids....I mentioned my puffiness to my Radiographer, they just said \"see your GP\"....any advice on this matter would be greatly appreciated....",

I think a lot of it is common sense, similar to when you are pregnant.... My craving atm is rice crispies, I think I'm safe with them lol.... DizzyD",

I'm feeling sick today so I'm living on rice crispies. I think the list states to stay away from takeaway because of the risk of food poisoning, but if you get it from a trusted supplier then I would say you are OK....",
