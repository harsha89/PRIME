      "Content": "So having been diagnosed on 14th March and sent for scans I had my next meeting with the NHS consultant on 15th April to be told the good news that there were no signs of cancer anywhere else but I needed a mastectomy with full axillary node removal and reconstruction. Here comes the rant - the NHS cannot operate until June earliest due to full lists and leave - totally unacceptable. Thankfully I have private medical insurance but I have now been forced into the position of having to arrange my own surgery - properly hacked off. I realise I am lucky to be in the position to do this and feel awful for others currently going through this at my local NHS unit who are being put through the asme delay but I really do not think this is right. Anyway - rant over and thanks for listening.",

      "Content": "Hi All I\u2019m new to this group having had chemotherapy treatment confirmed in the past few days.  I will be having either 6 cycles every 3 weeks or possibly 4 cycles every 2 weeks followed by 4 cycles every 3 weeks.  As I am in the lucky position to be going through this on private medical insurance I have the option to get my chemo treatment at home.  Have others done this? How did it go? I\u2019m a bit concerned about feeling isolated.  Thanks",
