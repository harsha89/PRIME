      "Content": "Hi, I have a totally different background to yours in terms of type of type of breast cancer (I'm her 2 negative but oestrogen positive) and our treatments are different too but I too had horrendous pain on one side during my period after starting tamoxifen.  It turns out it was a bleed in my fallopian tube that was endometriotic. I had to have it removed as it was large but tamoxifen can aggravate endometriosis, my oncologist and gynaecologist has said since.  Anyway, I'm sorry this is bit distant to your experience but I didnt know I had endometriosis until treatment started so I'm glad you are getting checked. It might not be, and  I'm certainly no expert but still good to be looked at to find out whats going on.  I hope it goes ok xx",

      "Content": "Hi, I too had a large seroma I had drained 3 times a week for nearly 4 weeks. I was given tramadol and still had oromorph from the op. But tramadol can be highly addictive and it is very strong and can make you feel a bit sick.  I found I only needed 1 tablet  twice a day (you can take more but I found that enough) and 5 mls of oromorph at night so I could get some sleep. At the time it feels like it's never going to go away, but it will get smaller eventually  I hope you find the right medicine to help you,  I feel for you big time xx",
