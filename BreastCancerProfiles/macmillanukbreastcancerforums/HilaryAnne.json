      "Content": "Hi Lindy1802 Thanks for your reply and for sharing your story. My tumour was 7mm, grade 2, invasive ductal cancer with spread to one of three Sentinal nodes so I had axillary clearance.  The tumour was removed by wide excision and I had further surgery to re-excise the margin.  Like you mine was caught early on a routine mammogram.  I am worried that if I don't take the treatment now I might regret it later but equally I am worried that by having the chemo I might develop long term side effects that could have been avoided because it wasn't necessary to have the chemo in the first place.  I'll never now the answer to that though. I'm waiting for a date with a second oncologist and in the mean time formulating a list of questions to ask.  Your response has helped with that so thank you once again.",

      "Content": "Hi I've just joined Macmillan's online community and I am hoping to get some advice. I was diagnosed with breast cancer at the start of the year and have had surgery.  The oncology results showed that the tumour was hormone receptive and HER2+ve.  Regarding the HER2+ve bit, it seems I am a borderline case due to the size of the tumour.  From past research with tumours smaller than mine chemo would not routinely be offered and with tumours larger, they would definitely recommend chemo.  However, in my case they are suggesting chemo, which would be Cyclophosphamide, Docetaxel (Taxotere) and Tratstuzumab (Herceptin) would improve my prognosis by a few percent, possibly 5 at most. I have to decide whether the distress of going through chemo and the risk of long term side effects is worth it. I would really like to hear about people's experiences that would help me reach this decision. Also I understand clinical trials are being conducted to investigate the use of Herceptin on its own but the results are not yet known or widely available.  I wondered about requesting Herceptin alone to reduce the risks of long term side effects.  Has anyone gone down this route? Many thanks.",
