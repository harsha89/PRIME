    "Content": "Hello Fiona, Wishing you good luck for tomorrow.  Your glass is definitely half full.....you are here talking about it. Chemo, is not the best experience but it is a positive one, just remember that.    Much as you may  not wish to eat , do try as it is really important to keep the blood good.  (My chemo was in Spain and they always insisted we eat before a session and drink water to rid some of the toxins) Yeah! who cares about a wig?  Go natural.   Be proud.    You are surviving. Good to hear you have friends that are joining in the 'fun'.  They know what to expect, and be with you all the way.   Those that avoid you (my experience) are not really your friends and best avoided in return.   You will feel tired, so just nod when you want to.  Plenty of time later on to be polite and socialize, people just have to go with your treatment. Lots of good wishes and luck for the future. Mary",
