      "Content": "Hi. I had a WLE and a sentinel lymph node biopsy in august. I was told they only take one node now . Unfortunately my node was positive so I was left with the agonising decision  to have a complete lymph node clearance or just radiotheraphy. I decided to have the clearance.that took place last thursday. Got the results yesterday and all nodes clear. Ifeel now that I put myself through the op for nothing but I wouldnt have been able to rest not knowing. So far no signs lymphodema Hope this helps",

Im afraid my employers are not as considerate as yours, im not going to leave though as long as I get the sick notes I will stay off. I dont think I will be emotionally ready when I start chemo, especially with the hair loss. You mentioned in one post that you take bisoprolol, I to take this for palpitations, has it interfered with your treattment at all. Ive requested you as a friend. Take care and good luck xxx big hugs",

      "Content": "Hi everyone. Ive been off work now about 3 weeks after complete lymph node clearance. Iv seen oncologist who recomends chemo, although the nodes were clear apart from SNB which was taken in august when I had lumpectomy.I took about 10 days off after first op. Ive now got to decided if I want chemo which will be 6 EC sessons every 3 weeks with possible radiotherapy in between or after. It looks like a long haul in front of me and im an emotional wreck at mo as my husband is undergoing chemo for liver cancer. I only work 15 hours a week in a small office and the other 2 employees are I presume doing my work. I dont want to mess them about by going back then having more time off for maybe bad days. They are paying me as normal at the mo although they are getting my sick notes. I had alot of holidays to take so maybe thats why they paying me as I wont get them in before year end. I need the money but feel guilty as they may need to get some one else in long term. Sorry to go on just fed up of everything today.",
