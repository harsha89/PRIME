      "Content": "Hi Lisa and all, I'm Annabel's husband (my name is Simon but Robert is my middle name. Unbeknown to her I joined the carers forum a month ago when her health started to dip a bit) A sincere and heartfelt thank you to you all for your truly thoughtful and helpful comments. Lisa, a huge thank you for sharing this news with forum members. All of your comments have made me smile this evening, something I haven't done for a while now. You're all absolutely spot on too; she was a determined, beautiful, caring, thoughtful and incredibly unselfish young woman. Putting others before her was something which she seemed to have a knack for. It just happened, and I'm so very proud of her. We've been together for 20 years and I've enjoyed every minute. I'm sure we've had squabbles (I know we have!) but she's given me so much happiness and I have so many amazing memories tucked away. It's these memories which will help me over the next weeks; they in turn will help me to do all I can for our boys and daughter. We'll never forgot our beautiful and quite amazing Annabel. Thank you ladies, you've helped me so much this evening. Much love to you all xxxx",

      "Content": "Hi Denise,many thanks for this. Yes, Annabel did say she had a fun Skype experience with you! Reading your comments and the comments from everyone else on here and on facebook (please add me if you do use it) have made me smile. I'm so very proud of Annabel, I really am. I will never forget her, nor will Alina or my boys Will & Sam. Thank you for connecting with her, supporting her and being a lovely friend to her. Your comments and the comments from others are helping me come to terms with things. Much love xx",
