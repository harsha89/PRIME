      "Content": "Hi, I'm new to the forum & need some advice. I was diagnosed with breast cancer 3 years ago & have just had the all clear on my mammogram for this year :) I've also just had blood tests that confirm I'm post menopausal so I've been swapped from Tamoxifen to Aromasin. On Tamoxifen, apart from the occasional hot flush & fatigue, I was doing well but I started Aromasin 12 days ago and the side effects are decidedly unpleasant! So far I've had; diarrhoea, insomnia, aching joints and hot flushes like never before and I'm SO tired its ridiculous. I work full time and don't get home most evenings until 7.15, at the moment I'm in bed by 9.30 at the latest but don't sleep despite being exhausted! Does anyone have an experience of side effects settling if I persevere? I'm not sure I can stick another 2 1/2 yrs feeling like this :/ Thanks everyone",

      "Content": "Thanks Kate. I'm hoping that the side effects will settle down with a bit of luck so I'll tough it out for now. I just wondered how common they are and whether I'm attributing them Aromasin when they could be something else?!! If they don't settle I'll certainly talk to my oncologist about changing back but she was very keen for me to change as soon as possible. Thanks again for replying :)",

      "Content": "Hi Maggie, nice to hear from another newbie :) I was given the survival statistics about Tamoxifen -v- AI's and that's really what drove me to change over. Anything at all that reduces my risks for the future is good with me! The aches and pains aren't awful, just new. I had horrid hot flushes when I started Tamoxifen but they settled to a manageable level after a few months & I'm hoping the same will happen here. My biggest problem at the moment is the exhaustion. I'm shattered when I go to bed and don't feel refreshed when I wake up and I feel like I'm awake more than I'm asleep overnight. I've tried all the usual - bath/milky drink etc but to no avail. Short term I can live with it but not long term :( I'm liking your style with the G&T but as I don't like Gin will Prosecco do the same job?? I wonder if a small glass 3 x daily could be prescribed on the NHS?! Thanks for taking the time to reply, it feels lonely sometimes on the end of a computer!",
