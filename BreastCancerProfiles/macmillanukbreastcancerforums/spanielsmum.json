      "Content": "Hi, I'm new to this site and just wanted to say how incredibly amazing you all are. I had a lumpectomy and lymph gland removal followed by chemotherapy and radiotherapy, back in 1999/2000. I celebrated the millenium with a glass of champers, a Hickman line and a 24 hr infusion pump!!I have had a couple of scares with benign lumps but thankfully nothing serious.... I marvel at how focused and calm some of you are, despite your illnesses.Truly inspiring!!!! I wish you all the best xx",

      "Content": "I needed a Hickman line as the Picc line wasn't suitable for my very small deep veins. I went into hospital overnight and was given a sedative to have it inserted. It was so much better than the upset of the nurse poking about trying to find a vein. I used to get really wound up when I knew I had a blood test coming up... Good luck..",
