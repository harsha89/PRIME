My head feels like it's in a fog and try as I might to not let it take over my every thought, it's always there worrying me.  I meet with the plastics team on Wednesday, hopefully that will make things clearer. Thank you for sharing, it helps a lot x",

      "Content": "Hi, I've recently been diagnosed with Invasive lobular carcinoma and following MRI have been told I need a mastectomy and sentinel node biopsy. I'm waiting to see the plastics team about reconstruction then a date for to have a combined mastectomy and reconstruction. What I'm confused about is they won't know if there is any lymph spread until after surgery so how will the team decide whether to reconstruct.  I'm told that radiotherapy and chemo can damage an implant and delay healing so wouldn't it be better to have the biopsy results first before doing a reconstruction?  Overwhelmed...",

      "Content": "Thank you for your replies, I'm finding this a bit confusing and then I look stuff up which confuses me more. The reason I've to have a full mastectomy is because the cancer has grown like a web throughout the breast, from ultrasound the nodes appear a normal size and aren't raising concerns at the minute.  Initially, before the MRI, when we thought it was just 2 lumps they booked a lumpectomy and SNB with likely radiotherapy afterwards, now that plan has changed.   Its an ER positive cancer and I'm told I will have to take drugs for 5-10 years after.  I asked about chemo but as yet they don't know.  I'm worried that if they reconstruct immediately and the SNB shows node involvement, subsequent radiotherapy will damage the recon, no? Grateful to have you all...",
