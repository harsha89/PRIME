    "Content": "Hi Sue You have had an awful lot to put up with. When I had treatment like that I had tio rebuild my own self perception-you are a different person, and no doubt much stronger psychologically though it may not feel like it. I certainly found huge help when I started taking vitamin D tablets-mood so much better and loads more energy. Immunity is helped generally. There is a lot on the internet about late effects of treatment, and groups set up to discuss them. Counselling can be worthwhile,no shame in it Take care of yourself. Exercise can help greatly with fatigue,strangely enough, and lots of water too all the best Carol",
