It must be hard with two very young children, you are still looking after them as well as all you are dealing with, mine are grown up 19 & 20 so easier to explain to them and reassure them along with them being able to look after themselves and me if necessary.  One thing I will say is if I can do this (everyone thought I would fall apart, and they are amazed at how I\u2019m coping) anyone can do this xx ",

      "Content": "I used to suffer with terrible insomnia and have tried various methods, I now actually fall asleep within five minutes of getting into bed which is wonderful, some of the methods I have used are, lavender spray, spray night clothes and bedding, Rose geranium oil that you put on your wrists and chest (this is my favourite smell of all time) don\u2019t drink anything with caffeine in after 9pm.  A warm bath before bed and no digital equipment an hour before bed.  Meditation especially the breathing techniques, there is one in particular, exhale through your mouth, close your mouth and inhale though your nose for a count of 4, hold your breath for a count of 7, exhale for a count of 8, repeat this 3 times. I did struggle to sleep when I was first diagnosed and found keeping a journal helped, this is a private journal on my iPad but a book is just as good, write everything down that you are feeling and everything that happens to you from appointments to people annoying you.  This helps me clear my mind and vent without upsetting anyone.  I literally write down what I want to shout at people, it helps me sort out what I\u2019m feeling and I also don\u2019t feel the need to say things to people because it also makes me think about how they are feeling too. I hope some of the above may help you.   ",

      "Content": "Hi Laurajane779,  my lump was HER2 negative Oestrogen positive, which is a good thing because as others have said they feed off oestrogen so your Mum will get hormone inhibitors, mine is going to be Letrozole, I am currently getting EC Chemo and will get Radiotherapy as well because there were certain things the oncologist didn\u2019t like about my cancer even though there was no node involvement it was displaying aggressive characteristics.  The chemotherapy is really an insurance policy to mop up anything that may have decided to go on a journey.   It can sometimes seem like an age from one step to the next and you all just want to get on with it but be assured the oncologists will do everything needed to get the right treatment for your Mum, it will be tailor made for her because no two breast cancers are the same.  As toxophilite says the cancer is out it is just making sure there is no recurrence.  As for chemo I am now day 9 post my first session and it has been okay, a little sick a little headachy and bloated feeling but I can say that is the worst I have had so far and today I feel almost back to my normal self so definitely doable. good luck to your Mum and keep supporting her the way you are  xx",
