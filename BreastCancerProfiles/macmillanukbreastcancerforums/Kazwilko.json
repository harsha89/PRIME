      "Content": "I am just wondering if there is anyone else having chemo mainly based on their age? I have IDC grade 2 PR+ HER neg.  I have had a lumpectomy and margins are clear and lymph nodes are also clear. I have been told that due to my age (33) I will need chemo - 6cycles , 4 weeks of radiotherapy and Taxomifen tablets for 10 years. I have just had my first cycle of chemo and obviously I'm not going to like it but I'm struggling with pain and nausea and I just don' feel like me. I have heard of the oncotype test but is it to late for that now? Do all NHS offer this service?  I think I just need to ask what percentage of benefit chemo has for me.",

      "Content": "I am on day 3 of my first cycle on EC.  I am struggling with nausea. I am already using the back ups provided and tomorrow I end my supply that I was sent home with. I am nervous as to how I will feel.  I already feel nausea to some smells and foods I use to love to eat. Cheese is a no go for me now If I start to be sick do I ring the hotline or the nurses. It' just with it being a Saturday. Maybe I will be ok but I am not drinking enough water due to the way I feel.",
