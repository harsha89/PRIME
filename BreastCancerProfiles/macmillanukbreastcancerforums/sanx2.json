      "Content": "Hi, I was diagnosed with breast cancer in March at nearly the age my mother was diagnosed. I had a lumpectomy done and fortunately nothing has spread to my lymph nodes but had to have precautionery chemo and then RT. But to throw a spanner in the works my oncologist decided to have genetics test done and that came back positive for BRCA2. I now have to make a very big decision before the RT starts although my chemo only finishes in 3 weeks time. I may have to have a bilateral mastectomy ... and this is my problem - do I have one or do I just hope and trust that the cancer will go away and go for screenings every several months and hope for the best or do I just get rid of it all. Is there someone out there that could help me with this huge decision.",
