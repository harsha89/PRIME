      "Content": "Hi folks, I have just had the 6th cycle of chemotherapy and have 2 more to go. Then I have to have radiotherapy. I know there is siupposed to be a period of time between the end of chemo and the start of the radiotherapy and I wonder if anyone can let me know the length of time between the two. I know there is no diffinitive answer but would like to have some kind of ballpark figure. One reason I need to know is to plan when for me is the best time to return to work. I am coming to the end of my full time sick pay entitlement and going onto half pay is going to be a very tight squeeze as you can all imagine. It would also be good to have some comments (please) from those who worked through radiotherapy. Thanks for your help Jazzx",

I elected not to have reconstruction straight away as I had read that radiation can effect what reconstruction you can have. I had the op a couple o f weeks agao and am getting used to just having one boob and i'm amazed at just how little it does bother me. I've also spent a lot of time recently reading all I can find, raiding the local library and investigating web sites. The more I have found out the less the fear becomes. Take care, and I hope all goes well for you, JazzcatXX",

It tends to happen in the morning just before I get out of bed and am having a stretch! So now I don't strtech that leg as much! I find I am still having quite a few hot spells still. I had hoped they would have gone by now but they show no sign of reducing! Take care, Kathx",
