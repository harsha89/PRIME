    "Content": "Hi BT (love that) Just wanted to say hi and let you know my diagnosis and treatment are pretty identical to yours with aggressive stage 3. My 1st chemo on March 16th went pretty well FEC for 1st 3 then adding in D and herceptin, followed by radiation.  I will be on the herceptin for 1 yr so am having a port put in sometime soon.  I was very surprised that after my first cocktail that I was not anywhere close to being as ill or had the nausea like I expected, for which I am grateful.  I can only hope and pray that it stays this way.  NO hair loss yet but I am told this will come sooner than later. I have already managed to find several wigs that will be interesting once I have to go there.  Next chemo April 9 - Good Luck and lets keep in touch. Toodi  ",
