      "Content": "Hi ya  When I was first diagnosed with BC in 2013 I had a lumpectomy and like you felt well.  I had my op at 9.30 and was home loading the washing machine at 4!! Wrong I know and I certainly don't promote this!  I was bruised around the area but cracked on with life.  Like others have said do your exercises and be careful of lymphedema.  The exercises help with the prevention of it.  Avoid lifting heavy things with your affected arm, sudden heat changes like stick your hand in hot water, avoid cuts and grazes etc.  This is something you need to adopt for always not just a few weeks.  But remember lymphedema is just fluid in the wrong place, as my breast care nurse says if you suffer with swollen ankles on a flight that's lymphedema so just be sensible Do rest and take it easy whilst you wait for your histology results and get the next steps, good luck hope it's just radio you need Sarah x",

      "Content": "Hi 4paws Sorry you are experiencing this but you can get a grip of it honest.   Advice of pre dosing on paracetamol was the best advice my oncologist gave.  Start them a day or two before your treatment.  If paracetamol don't touch it cocodamol will and you can get these from your gp so don't wait for your next onco appointment.  Tell your onco team you need the anti sickness, mine said I shouldn't need them but I was to let them know if I did.   It does pass honest and your taste will come back but once you feel like eating just eat whatever you feel like, cold vimto and warm elderflower juice have been my staples. The aches and pain will ease, I just made sure I didn't need to do anything after my treatment so if I wanted to stay in bed there would be nothing to stress me Don't lose sight that now you're on the docetaxel you're on the home straight, stay strong and big hugs always here if you need to chat Sarah x",

      "Content": "Hi Like you I'm new to the forum but not new to BC.  I was originally diagnosed 3yrs ago and had a lumpectomy  and was fine until my annual check up a fortnight ago where they found it had come back.  Now I'm waiting for a CT scan to see if it's spread anywhere else before they confirm my next steps.  And yes it's very scary and I'm unsure if it's scarier first or second time around.  The folks who have posted already are absolutely right once you get through this investigation period and the treatment plan kicks in your routine does settle honest.  One piece of advice I wish I'd got first time is be prepared for the radiotherapy and start using E45 cream or similar unscented moisture on the affected boob Take care and stay strong xx",

      "Content": "If I'm honest I'm still waiting for that time which the rational side of me knows that is bonkers but when I see hair in my brush I do panic then realise it's normal hair loss.  The chemo has done it's worse and is no longer causing problems.  I'm finding it hard to move on from my chemo bubble as it consumed my entire life for 6 months but I'm working on it. My hairdresser was amazing, I was really worried and told her I was shedding loads.  When she washed my hair she said compared to other clients I'd shredded very little, now whether that was a fib or not who know's but boy did it give me a boost as well as walking out with a new style and colour I was on top of the world for the first time in a long time! Enjoy being pampered and doing something nice, you worked bloody hard going through that cold cap malarkey so see this as a celebration or 2 fingers up at the chemo!!!! Sarah xx",

      "Content": "Wow reading this is like reading about me even down to the spa weekend!!!  I'm off for mine next weekend and I can't wait.  I'm very breathless at time and the letrazole seems to be making the my joints stiffer. Yes breathless etc is partially because you've been taking it easy but also don't forget we have been poisoned.  My energy levels are slowly increasing and rather setting massive goals for myself I setting very small ones and thats things like being able to finish the housework faster each time.  Some folks may scoff but it really gives me a confidence boost the nearer I get to the time it took to do jobs pre-chemo.  My next big challenge is to use the stairs at work rather than the left.  The target is to build up one flight at a time. How are your eyebrows and lashes? My brows are coming back nicely but my lashes are buggered.  I've tried the strip flash ones but I'm useless and think I'm doing more damage than good trying to get them one so I've given up with them and sticking to the chemo look :-) Take care and do book your weekend sooner rather than later!

      "Content": "Hi Lisa I too had my first chemo session last week (Tuesday) and boy has it knocked me for six! I've had waves of nausea all day every day which I'm sure the anti sickness meds have stopped it being worse.  I will be speaking to my chemo nurse to see if it can be even better next time as I'm really worried about the next session. I've had headaches everyday, trying to get at least 2 litres of fluid down each day has been a challenge as I've had no interest in anything, even chocolate is no longer my friend. I also wonder if the headaches are the side effects of the cold cap.  I was advised if I can tolerate the first 20mins then I should be alright for the rest of the session.  Typical of me I so enjoyed the first 20mins as it was the first time since my first BC diagnosis 3 years ago that I was not boiling hot! However I really struggled with the last 2hrs of the session and that's what's given me the headaches. Good luck with your next session  Sarah xx",
