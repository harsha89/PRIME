      "Content": "Thanks Elaine, glad to hear you're doing well.  I've just come back from the chemist and now got a different brand again, Wockhardt (I know I've probably spelt that wrong, but I haven't got the pack in front of me!). See how I get on, third different brand I've had!  Did the GP give you anything for the back pain, or just change your brand of letrozole? I've got a bit of pain, but it eases off when I move around. x",

      "Content": "Hi all, I was diagnosed with grade 2 invasive lobular cancer just before Christmas (actually on my birthday, but as the surgeon said it doesn't pay any attention to dates!). Had a double mastectomy beginning of February (my mum died from breast cancer). Good news was I had clear margins, no lymph node involvement and they sent a sample away for the Oncytype DX test, which came back with a low score, so no chemo (yay!). I am taking tamoxifen for 10 years, but what i was wondering was do you need to go for regular check ups with a GP while on it? I have had different brands as the chemist can never seem to get the same one! On one of the leaflets in a pack it said to have check ups, but the other doesn't say anything! Does anybody have these or only if you have an issue? I've been taking it since beginning of March.  This is the first time I've written on this site, but all your help and advice to others has helped me out a lot when going through this journey we would all rather not take, so thank you x ",

      "Content": "Thanks Jo I'm 46 and yes, pre-menopausal. I was ER+ and HER2- . I will certainly ask the question regarding blood tests. I have had one period since starting the tamoxifen, but nothing for a while! Hope you're getting on ok with the Tamoxifen and all the best with your  tests next week. Xx",
