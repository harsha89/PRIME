      "Content": "Hi Becs Also BRCA1, my mastectomy and reconstruction was performed by the lovely Anushka Choudhry in North Wilts.  It is not perfect however I was warned of that and she also gave me advice on what improvements were possible through further surgery. A friend of mine had a bad job fixed by Drew Fleming, I think he is SW London.  Good luck!",

      "Content": "Hi I don't live alone but I can give you the perspective of what my husband did to help so you can figure out alternatives... Deciding.  I found my decision making capacity deteriorated somewhat, so you should be aware of stressing yourself out unnecessarily - turn to friends or here to help you make decisions. And being on your own you need to take even more care than ever to follow their instructions.  The biggie for me was neutropenia.  I waited 4 hours after first high temp reading before even telling my hubby and was really quite unnerved when I finally did call, expecting reassurances, and instead was advised to come in to isolation ward immediately, ending up there for 4 days.  I don't want to scare you just prepare you, most sail through without inpatient hospital stays but it is on the cards so you may need to have contingency for your hamster and take the advice seriously. I found I was fine for about 3 hours after chemo session then started downhill, usually only first eve was v rough then started easing up from next day, we all react differently and to the diff drugs but you will likely follow a similar pattern each cycle Best of luck x",
