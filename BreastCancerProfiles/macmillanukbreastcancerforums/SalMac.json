    "Content": "Hi All, Several wonderful websites have already been listed, but another one for practical support for children when you have chemo is Cancer Hair Care. They have a section of free help for children and can supply a topsy turvy doll (see quote from their website below).  I have a sample one in my office (dont know who donated it) and I am sure that any little girl (or boy) would find it helpful to understand what is happening to Mummy when she loses her hair as one dolly is 'before chemo' and the other is 'after chemo'.  There is a short video of a little girl talking about how hers helps.  www.cancerhaircare.com/page/free-childrens-services/95 \"FREE Specialist dollies - our knitted topsy turvy dolly helps children to understand hair loss through play. The dolly has hair on one side and no hair on the other. Each dolly comes complete with little hats and scarves for children to play with.  Dollies are available in multiple skin colours. Each dolly is health and safety checked.\" hope this can help with the practical and role-play element",
