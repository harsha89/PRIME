    "Content": "Hi Sume, Â  i also live on a farm I breed alpacas and I'm now on my second round of chemo, I was told not to handle the animals at all no cleaning out so my kids reluctantly do it as well as my oh, I have three dogs though that live in the house and was told that they would be fine as they are domestic animals. I wash my hands after touching them or any toys or dishes because they can roam the farm picking up dirt on thier feet. At first I was scared to touch them now I just clap them as normal because without them it would be hard to get through the day. I do miss my animals though and the cleaning out but there is a down period in your treatment find out when that is in mine it is day ten to fourteen and I just clean my hands obsessively but I always did. Get your dog the kids will benefit from it as much as you right now, enjoy marleen x",
