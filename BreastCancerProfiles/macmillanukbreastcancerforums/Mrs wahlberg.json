    "Content": "Hi I have a smiler problem and my veins are terrible no matter where they are. I did have a PICC line fitted, but it got infected so had to be removed. I have been told that I can't have a tourniquet on my arm but can have blood taken. So what happens now is I have a heat pad placed on my arms for Â about 5-10 minutes then blood taken. I know not all places have heat pads by It might be worth asking if they do and if not can they get some. Hope this helps a little and good luck! X",
