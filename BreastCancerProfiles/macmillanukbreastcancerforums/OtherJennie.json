    "Content": "Hi AmeLou I've just been through the same dilemma- it's awful so I sympathise with you. My onco result was 19 (1 into intermediate). I'm HER2- E+ Grade 2 lymphnodes were clear thank god! After I saw the oncologist I got a second opinion privately to gather as much info as I could. I also used the 'predict' tool online. My percentages were so small ( 2% less for reoccurrence and 1.2% increase for survival over 10 years). At first I was tempted by chemo to 'throw everything at it' but I've learnt it doesn't work like that and you can over treat yourself. I was happy to make the decision not to have it. Plus I wanted to save my ovaries to try and have children!! I would wait until your onco comes back as that might decide it for you! If you're borderline like me I'd get as much information as possible about your individual situation/cancer and go with what feels right! You'll make the right decision xx",
