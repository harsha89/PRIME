    "Content": "Hi Janice (& everyone else!) I had my last \"T\" on 23rd dec and also suffered from tiredness and bones aching. I just want to reiterate what Libby (?) said about it working. I know we are all different but I have gone from needing a full  mastectomy and lymph nodes removed at dx in August to having a lumpectomy last week. My lump was large (8.5 cm x 6 cm) and solid, they put a wire coil in at the start of treatment and last week they had to put a wire from the coil to locate the lump as it was so small and soft it could no longer be felt. (well I could still feel it!!!) Also I had a SNB which came back clear, the chemo had killed all the cancer in the affected node. So, don't give up. Hopefully, after your second lot you should be able to feel a difference in your lump size. In the meantime, rest, rest and more rest.  Take care and all the best xxx",
