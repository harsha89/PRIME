      "Content": "Hiya, good luck with starting chemo. I start mine in 3 days, I'm having FEC then FECT. Ive decided not to use the cold cap l, although the nurse told me 70% of women that tried it were happy with the result I wouldn't be able to live with the headache it can cause as I have a headache most days anyway. My kids (ages 8, 10 and 13) and I have planned a haircut day where the one week after my first chemo they are going to cut if for me before my husband shaves it off. I've got some gorgeous scarfs ready and a wig (although I'm not planning on wearing a wig). I'd love for my hair to stay but I've accepted the loss as part of the healing process :) Again good luck to you and I hope the cold cap works well for you Xxxx",
