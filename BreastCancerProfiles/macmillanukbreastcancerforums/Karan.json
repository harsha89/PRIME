I'm afraid I was off work for 12months (but did need 8rounds of chemo) but hopefully you will be able to return to your role when you feel physically and mentally stronger.Good luck with what ever you decide, and enjoy your macmillan coffee morning (my schools is next Wednesday) can't think of a better cause!!!

I've been off work for 11mths now so I started to pop into work to help build my confidence before starting on a phased return. I was greeted by the person covering my role who said when are you returning to work because I've taken your role and there's not room for two of us. She said that she'd put a lot of work into it while I've been off and wasn't willing to stand aside. It didn't register with with me until I got home what had been said. All that weekend I felt very low and scared about going back to work. After thinking about it for days on end I called my manager and reported what had been said. I'm so glad I called because she said it was a temp step up until my return. We'll I'm never going to have to work with her again because I've just found out I'm being made redundant. I do hope you find a way though this and come out the other side (the winning side). Best wishes karan",

( I had lost it was my bathroom scales not working lol) But she gave me a card for a health trainer, which I phoned and got an appointment the very next day. She gave me a voucher for 12 FREE sessions for slimmers world ( can also get them for weight watchers) It's helped me enormously and I'm 3& half pounds away from my target.

It makes your treatment slightly longer if I remember correctly 30mins before chemo is started ( my nurse said to cover hair in conditioner) I tried it for my 1st chemo but hair started to fall out a couple of days before my second treatment so I stopped. It was uncomfortable for 1st 20mins but bearable for the rest, I did get a head ache but went with painkillers. (Part of the reason for stopping was that I hated the grey roots and not being able to dye it) or I maybe would have given it a little longer?

( I think twice a month is just right)  I heard about our group when the hospital gave me the Macmillan information pack about breast cancer at diagnosis. ( a leaflet on volunteers and phone numbers to contact)  I know a couple of ladies meet a couple of times a month from just talking on here!

A CT scan showed cysts on my liver and just to be sure I was sent for another CT scan then an MRI after mounths of waiting it was confirmed it was cysts.  To cut a long story short I was told to lose two stone then go back to plastic surgeon. I lost weight by end October and waited months to see the surgeon again.  Anyway I was finally given a date for DEIP reconstruction 15th April ( as part of the pre-op) I was given another CT scan ( here we go again) CT scan showed up something again!!! Grrrrrrrrr  Operation was cancelled and was told I needed an altra sound scan. Had scan they are still not sure!! Grrrrrrrr So I saw my original surgeon who did my mastectomy and who had ordered all the scans last year ( He was not happy!!!)  He said all they needed to do was call him and he would have sent over a copy of all the scans ( which he then did) He also wasn't happy about my tamoxifen being stopped.  Well I get a call 10days later with a new date 13th May saying they were happy to go ahead all scans matched ( this yrs and last)  yeah I thought!!  But last Friday we started a four day break in the Lake District before operation only to get a call from the hospital saying they was cancelling my op again because my LIVER grrrrrrrrr. We had just ordered food in pub and the call made me feel sooooo sick I didn't eat my food. They are NOW saying scans don't match and this is something new on my liver!!  I called my BCN left message--- she called me back to say she was leaving for the day and there would be an MDT meeting this week about me. Does this mean it's something to worry about???? When we reached the lodge I had no phone signal and there was no internet. Omg!!!! I got in my car ( bumped my car into a post) more Grrrrrrr drove until I got signal.  I spoke to a lovely Macmillan nurse who advised me to speak to pals.  I can't tell you the power and comfort of this site ( but couldn't access it all weekend)  Does anyone know what test is going to show what's up with my liver???????  Besause im fed up!!!!!! a biopsy????  They keep telling me different things until the point I no longer trust them! I'm soooo stressed what should have been a lovely weekend -- turned into me feeling sick, having pains attacks with my lips going numb and not being able to think of anything else.  So sorry to rant when I know so many of you are going through this hell!

When I looked up I could see my car rolling backwards towards a motorbike behind me-- I couldn't believe my eyes and ran around the car and pulled on the hand brake just in time!! I then continued to fill up my car feeling very embarrassed!! So when does chemo brain go or am I just a plonka lol? I think I can answer that myself!! Just thought I'd make you smile hugs k",

My tumour grew during 8rounds of chemo and had a mx four weeks after completing chemo. This was November 2013. Last year I asked the question does size matter on here--- I got replies from ladies with bigger tumours than mine and was still here to tell the tale years later!! ( I found the mx straight forward) and had no pain. For me it was more the emotional side of things but you do come to terms with the loss of your Breast in time. Be strong your moms very lucky to have you ",

I'm only asking because I'm desperate to have my DIEP reconstruction and the tummy tuck is just a bonus lol. I saw my surgeon last June and was told I needed to lose 2 stone, so after months of dieting I lost the weight by first week in November. I have an appointment this Thursday to see surgeon and it's taken 3 months to get this appointment!! This has felt a very long wait!!! If he says come in next week I would jump at it!! All I'm saying is that it's a massive operation to put yourself through if your not sure??? So maybe giving yourself more time to think about it would be best?? what ever you decide it's got to be the right decision for you! Good luck either way love k",

I can't comment on periods because I had an hysterectomy 5yrs ago. I'm having Auricular acupuncture at the moment and it's helped cut down the amount of hot flushes and sweats I'm having but they are still there!! Not sure if that's something you could look into???? Are you on tamoxifen because one of the side effects are hot flushes? I was told by my chemo nurse to try black cohosh from the health shop to help with hot flushes (but I've not tried them because I was also told that you can't take them with tamoxifen) how true that is I don't know??? You can buy pillows off amazon that you can chill and put in bed with you. Hope you soon get some relief best wishes k",

But I'm trying my best as I'm sure you are so we just need to listen to our body's and be patient (as hard as it is) recovery is slow BUT SURE!

The night before seeing the plastic surgeon the BCN phoned me to say you need to have another ct scan of my liver because they think I have cysts on my liver? I had this scan two weeks ago. Today I thought I would call the hospital to see if my results were back? Only to be told that I now need an MRI on my liver for a more detailed look.I asked the BCN is it only cysts ? And she said yes. But why on earth do I need an MRI if they say it's only cysts???? I'm now feeling a little emotional thinking oh no what if it isn't?

Tips I picked up along the way ----paint your nails dark to protect them from the light and it helps stop them from falling off! Make sure you take any anti- sickness tablets given to you. ( also try ginger biscuits) they help with feeling sick. Be very carefully in the sun ( take cover in this heat) your skin will be more sensitive to the sun. The hospital will give you a mouth wash to help with the mouth ulcers.(actually the hospital called it my party bag ) it was full of meds to help with most things--- indigestion, sickness, constipation, you name it it was in there lol! And if it isn't ask there's always something to help with the side effects! Accept all offers of help from friends & family as they like to feel they are helping in some way.And most important REST when you need to!! I hope this helps a little. Wishing you and your sister all the best for your treatment k",
