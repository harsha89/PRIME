    "Content": "HiÂ  I had a lumpectomy on right side on 10/5/18 and was offered a reduction on left side at the same time which I accepted so I was equal. I was a GG cup and am now probably a DD or E. Surgeon did a marvellous job. I fully expected to be in agony but had surprisingly little pain. Anaesthetist put spinal blocks one either side just before operation began. Never needed anything more than ibruprofen and paracetamol. Took it regularly at home to start with even though it wasn\u2019t painful just sore. I was terrified beforehand but really there\u2019s nothing to be scared about. No one could believe how well I looked afterwards. Went to a musical 3 days later ( friends were going to try and sell my ticket - no chance!) and went to see Sparks a blast from the past 12 days later. Best wishes for monday",
