    "Content": "Hello Goldjo, i too was diagnosed with DCIS and had LD flap reconstruction with expander implant on 20th June. i had Sentinal node biopsy and had clear nodes. I had my pathology results last Friday which confirmed DCIS so will not need radiotherapy :) unfortunately i will have to have my nipple removed due to DCIS discovered in this area. I Have made a good but in my opinion slow recovery ( but then i am very impatient!) Still needing pain relief at night but i think that is because i tend to lay in one position! Here hoping your lymph nodes are clear. Dawn x",
