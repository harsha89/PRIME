I've got some cysts going on and he thought that the pain and itchiness is probably hormones so I need to go down that route now. I'm relieved. I'm glad that they're onto your treatment straight away, although I don't need to be on this group I will stay right here for you. I'm gonna to be your cheerleader, if you want me that is. So I will be thinking of you tomorrow. Anytime that you want to chat. Take good care. Xx ",

      "Content": "Thank you for getting back to me so quickly. I'm still waiting for my appointment, if I haven't heard anything by tomorrow I will be giving my GP a call as it will have been a week since I saw him.  I felt the lump and difference in my breast once the doctor found it, I'd written the pain and itchiness off to fibromyalgia so I was very surprised when he found a lump, I've had three breast lumps removed in the past (all have been fibroidenomas, I'm not sure of the spelling) and it feels very different to them. You've certainly got your hands full, have you got someone to look after them when you go to the clinic? I'm sorry that you are going through this too. I don't think I've ever had a thought that has taken up so much of my mind before. My dog is very helpful but, like you, I  find my mind drifting back. Xx ",

I didn't find a lump though, I went to the GP for something else and just happened to mention the extreme itchiness and pain in my breasts, he found a lump, I'm now waiting for an appointment. I am very nervous and scared too. I hope you are finding ways to keep busy. I went to a meditation class yesterday and for most of that hour I managed not to think about it. I'm not sure if it will help if I do it on my own but I'm going to give it a try. Wishing you all the luck. :)",

      "Content": "My dog is a Jack Russell cross with a Bichon Frise, very cute, cuddly and cheeky! I've had him just over a year, I  got him from a rescue centre. He's still very nervous with people he doesn't know, particularly men but he's perfect for me, he's snuggled into me as I type.  I've just had my appointment through for the 28th which is 15 days after seeing my GP which is pretty good, I think. I'm currently not sure whether this has made me more or less nervous.  That is hilarious about your breast pump! I hope it was a really good night. I was about to say take baby wipes to keep your breasts fresh during the tests but you're going to your baby with you so of course you'll have wipes! Are you going to take anyone with you (apart from your baby)? I'm not sure whether I am or not, my family all live far away and most of my friends work. Sometimes I feel I cope better with things when I'm on my own.X ",
