    "Content": "Dear Karen 234, I've had really bad bloating with my chemotherapy too. I ended up at A&E with a sore stomach and the doctors couldn't figure out what the cause was, but my husband did .  I've found the best (if not most elegant) thing is to burp - a lot! You can help the process by walking, raising both hands above your head, bending down ... Gaviscon/Pepto Bismal didn't help for me. I also try not to talk when I'm eating, to breathe out when I swallow, and to adjust what I eat e.g. eggs seem to make it worse. Hope this helps and good luck ￼￼. ",
