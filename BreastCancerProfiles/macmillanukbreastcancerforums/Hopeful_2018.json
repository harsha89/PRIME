    "Content": "Hi Jay! Im sorry to read about your situation! Your not on your own with being messed around about your diagnosis, my mums going through the same thing. Its been such a stress and a struggle. My mum didnt realise it has spread to her lung til her last appointment but they already knew before then! Have you had any treatment at all yet? Was your diagnosis 16 weeks ago? My mum has only received chemo yesterday after about 13 weeks but shes really sick today. All i can say is keep your chin up, but i know how hard that can be! :(Â  Em x",
