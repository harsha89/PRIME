It must be exhausting. I think you should give yourself a pat on the back for coping as well as you have. I'm sick of even hearing myself talk about breast cancer and I only found my lump in December! Very best wishes to you angelajane",

      "Content": "Hi ZomersetGirl!I know you wanted to hear from younger women like yourself but felt I had to reply because you said you are terrified - and we have that in common! Don't know if any of the following will help but here is my experience. At age 60 I had never had a general anaesthetic and was scared of everything - so was very relieved to wake up - and feel OK! with a tremendous sense of relief that the surgery was over - I was still alive! and my dodgy breast gone. It is different in some ways for everyone but for me - my drain wasn't a problem - just a bit awkward and was removed the next day. Although I did have some fluid build up after a few days and this had to be drained off. That sounded horrid but really wasn't a problem. The area round the scar was numb so I didn't even feel it. I guess the nerves are damaged in that area - which can be a bonus! I didn't look at my scar until a nurse changed the dressing the second time and I had a little peep! wasn't as bad as expected. I had steristrip things across it and there was a fair bit of bruising. Someone had suggested to me that I cover the big mirror in my bathroom until I had been home a few days to give me time to get used to it first by looking at it from above so to speak! rather than a full frontal. So before I went into hospital I covered the big mirror with lots of lovely pictures of beaches and trees. It made me feel a bit more in control I think. Now, 4 months later I still wish I had my old breast - but I try to think of my scar as my badge of survival and courage - which all us ladies have in spades! I was very weepy a couple of days after getting home, but you have to have an outlet for all the emotions - and the post op relief followed by starting to worry about results of the op and treatment ahead started to take over. But you just have to take it one stage at a time and deal with it however is best for you. Very best of luck - Hope you too look back and think - oh that wasn't so bad after all!",
