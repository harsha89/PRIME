    "Content": "Hi - I'm new to this forum! I also started tamoxifen mid Sept after coming off Arimidex which gave me too many aches and pains!  Like you I have bad muscle aches at the back of my ankles, also elbows too!  Especially when I get up in the morning and after sitting for any length of time! I try and go swimming several times a week but still haven't found anything to reduce it! I also get loads of hot flushes!  Sorry I don't have any great ideas to help!!  ",
