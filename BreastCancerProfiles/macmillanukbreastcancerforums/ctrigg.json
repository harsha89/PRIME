I have made steps to seek counselling ive been in touch with cancer support at local hospital but I do so much want try and get some sense of calm I have been prescribed some anti depressants but I'm not ready take them. The only reason I had Mri was a pre op scan for healthy side as I'm having further preventative surgery I didn't think it would open a can of worms I thought the chemo had worked just thinking all sorts. Julie I hope your scan is ok I had a bone scan too and that came back ok. Thanks again x",
