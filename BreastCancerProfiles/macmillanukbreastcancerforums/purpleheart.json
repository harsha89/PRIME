      "Content": "Thank you Helen I found your response extremely helpful and supportive. I have followed the line of respecting her decision, and she has shared with me her sound reasons, also I've have been with her to her appointments so I do feel well informed, I guess your comment about 'we just don't know what will happen' is probably the nub of it, for both of us. We have both felt affronted at times by the medical model and their arrogance and belittling of alternative therapies, and there is a part of me that is concerned that her decision to say no is a reaction to how she's been treated so far, rather than the chemo itself.Â  And also she witnessed her mum die painfully slowly from chemo at similar age to where's she's at now, so of course, its very scary and evoking a lot of loss, and anger too. I guss my role is to sit with the discomfort, alongside her, and not crumble, which sometimes I feel close to. We both have supportive friends so we are very lucky, I'm just feeling rather fragile at the moment.",

      "Content": "Hi Sasha Thank you for getting in touch, and sharing your experiences of alternative approaches, sono photodynamic therapy sounds very interesting, and I would love to find out more including contact details here in the UK. Also, have you heard much about use of mistletoe therapy, think it comes from Germany? Thanks for taking the time to respond, i put you up as potential friend as another person online recommended you, but have removed now, as not really sure how this site works, still trying to get a grip on it, though I have to say it seems great.",

      "Content": "I hope it ok for me to post in the BCG, I'm the partner of someone with breast cancer, haven't had any responses in the carers forum. My partner has had a mastectomy and now chemotherapy is recommended. They are chosing to refuse the chemo, but will take the temoxifen. I understand that each person's choice is their own, and my partner has faith in alternative/complimentary therapies, which is great, but I feel unsettled in where to place myself, should I, for example, be trying to influence them more towards the chemo, or just support whatever choices they are making? Sometimes I feel like their family are frustrated by my apparent passivity, and are wanting me to take a more assertive stance towards chemotherapy. From this group's wealth of knowledge and experience, I would love to hear from anyone who may have some wise words..",

      "Content": "Thank you Yvonne I feel lucky to have tapped into such wise words from you and Helen, I think I just really needed the reassurance. You have articulated really well my belief that my parrtner needs to have ownershhip and a sense of control over whichever treatment route she takes, I really feel for her having to make any decisions at all, let alone life-seeking ones.. and in the face of uncertainty and some resistance from her family, and some friends. I guess we all just want her to be ok and not feel alone, even though I'm sure a part of her is very lonely right now. And reading my words, I suppose I am too. Sometimes we need to get our support from others that's outside of our partnerships, and today getting help from wise soldiers who understand the terrain has been invaluable to me, to help me manage the dark cloud of doubt that is building in my stomach. And to remind me that my role is to try and stay upbeat.",
