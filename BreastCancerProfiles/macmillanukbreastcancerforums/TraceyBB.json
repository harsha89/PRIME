      "Content": "Hello All I haven't been on here for quite a while, but during my treatment took great comfort reading the advise and support from all you strong ladies and gentleman on this site..  I had single mastectomy n LD flap reconstruction in January, luckily I didn't require any further treatment only tamoxifen. In September I was sent for an MRI scan because I have been experiencing quite severe pain in my back since the operation and it has started to get worse.  When I went for my results on Monday they told me that they had found two areas of concern, one on my spine and the other on my hip (although they said they were not so concerned by the area on my hip) and when they examined my back the most intense pain coincided with the images, when I asked what they thought it could be they advise me that they strongly suspected that it was secondary cancer (although my lymph nodes were clear after the mastectomy, so I was surprised that they suspected it had spread). The lovely great care nurse arranged for me to have a CT scan on wednesday and to have results rushed through for the Thursday clinic (so very lucky that I didn't have to wait).  My consultant told me that the CT scan hadn't picked anything up and now I need a PET Scan.  I asked if this means it's not cancer and he said that the MRI scan is more sensitive and they still believe its 70% likely to be cancer and that if it is they wouldn't be able to remove it, just zap me with radiotherapy and monitor me.  They have said that it will take unto 2 weeks for the PET Scan and then need to go to a Thursday clinic for results, so its goon be a while yet. Please has anyone else had this experience.  I can't get my round the fact that one scan shows something n another doesn't  and unfortunately I left without asking questions.........",

      "Content": "Thank you Angela, George and Jackie Fortunately, up until now I've never been an ill person, never had surgery or even been of work sick in the eighteen years I've been with my present employer, so this is very unknown ground to me.  When the consultants gave me a 6 - 8 week recovery I focused on that and pre-surgery told myself I'd be out n about n back to work within 6 weeks......then when he told me I would definitely be ok to go on a 10 hour flight within 11 weeks of surgery I thought brilliant.   So, I've automatically thought it must be me......I must be a wee bit pathetic and not have such a strong pain threshold as I thought I had.......and being so emotional and teary? well, I'm normally the strong practical one, the one who's always there for everyone else...so I don't think my husband and children know how to handle me, bless them.   So thank you so so much , your comments have really helped me understand that I am normal.....(as normal as I could be!!!). and that my pain, discomfort and emotions are correct at this stage of recovery. I just wish the surgeon and nurse hadn't been so sparing with his post op information, so that I could have prepared myself for what to truly expect and not imagine the worse.     I have got myself a v-shaped pillow and some others to prop myself up and are constantly dosing myself with paractamol and ibuprofen. My consultant told me of the side effects of tamoxifen and the risk of dvt, so I am not going to start taking them until I come back from my holiday.  I was advised by physio to take aspirin, wear flight socks and an arm sleeve as a precaution, I can't get an arm sleeve from my doctor so need to get one online somewhere, so any info on where to get one would be appreciated.  again, thank you.....",

      "Content": "Good afternoon Angela, thank you for you message. So sorry to hear that you still have fluid and pain, after so long and after all you've been through. I don't know what sort of aftercare is normal, but having had my mx and LP flap reconstruction done privately, I only saw the consultant at 7 & 14 days post-op and then again on Wednesday at my request 8 weeks post-op.  I had initially contacted the breast care nurse allocated to me at the hospital when I was first diagnosed on Monday, but she just referred me back to the consultant.; so it seems I don't have their support.  Many people on here talk about their breast care nurse and mcmillan nurse, but I haven't got one. The consultant didn't really give me any advise on wednesday, but after seeing the physio on Wednesday afternoon I went to see my GP on Thursday because the physio told me to to get tablets better suited to nerve pain as I am only taking paracetamol.  I have not been taking ibuprofen but will try and take them along side the paracetamol as you have suggested.  Unfortunately, I was informed the GP that I am registered with left the practice in October and has not been replaced yet, so I saw a locum.  She was really nice, although I think it would of been nice to see a doctor and got to know them n them me.  She prescribed me amitriptyline, which she said would take 7-10 days to get into my system, so hopefully they will help for my holiday.   Although I have tried to be upbeat and chirpy with family and friends, 8 n half weeks after surgery, n going 6 weeks without seeing anyone professionally or emotionally to discuss my recovery, concerns etc.. i feel quite alone and I feel so blooming emotional.  I have given myself a good talking to though; because unlike you and so so many others on here I didn't need any further treatment; so should consider myself very fortunate... thank you again for your reply. Very much appreciated. hope you are feeling better soon and sending you best wishes and hugs.",

I have been taken 30mg of amitriptyline at night along with paracetamol and ibuprofen and it seems to be helping slightly already, so hopefully I'm getting there. Gilly, wanting a reconstruction is not vain, I chose to have a reconstruction at the same time as my mx because I didn't want to be constantly reminded whenever I looked on the mirror. I'm sorry if my comments regarding my LD Flap reconstruction have made you worried about what type you choose.  My consultant said that 95% of women recover in 6 - 8 weeks and that I'm just unfortunate that mines taking a lot longer.   Unfortunately I wasn't advised before making my decision that there are groups that you can attend/contact for help and guidance, in hindsight I wish I had attended one of these for help before making my decision.   This is such a huge decision to make and although I have not been in contact with them personally,  I have now been advised on this forum that breast cancer care and maggies can offer help with you and give you information about different procedures.  Such a lot to take in, wishing you all my support Tracey",

Two came out over £500 for the 12 days!!  a couple at just under £300, insure pink quoted me £180 (but wouldn't cover me for the reconstruction because I am still taking painkillers, therefore not fully recovered), but I eventually for a good quote from saga (now that I am in the over 50 club); they covered me for £145 for the 12 days....this included the reconstruction; even though I am on painkillers and therefore classed as not fully recovered. I hope this information helps you.  I'm not feeling too anxious about the actual holiday anymore, but the flight still concerns me!!!!!! but it will be just so so lovely to spend time with my whole family!!!!!!!!! put the last few months behind us and enjoy each others company.

      "Content": "Hello everyone thank you so so much for all your advise and support.......it really has been such a massive help and given me such reassurance.  I have found myself stalking the site reading up about everyones experiences....,, It has made me realise even more how lucky I have been that I didn't require any further treatment after my mx and LD lap reconstruction.  It has made me feel guilty for moaning when I see what some of you's have had to go through... So, I am only gong to list my experience below to help reassure others or to help them realise they are not alone with their problems/concerns. I managed to get an appointment with my consultant yesterday lunch time at his weekly clinic.  When I saw him pre-op he gave my husband, daughter and myself a lot of confidence , but I must say i have come to realise he didn't give me much information on what to expect post surgery and  neither he or his nurse haven't been terribly helpful regarding the aftercare - I had my operation 14th January and saw him 7 & 14 days post-op and haven't seen him his breast care nurse since. During my consultation it was noted that: My breast is large, swollen and hard and my underarm and back are swollen and painful (Being only a B cup I do look very odd - one B cup one GG cup)  The consultant said in his experience 95% of woman are fully recovered 6 -8 weeks after mx and LD reconstruction..I'm unfortunate to be one of the 5%.  He advised me to just be patient, eventually the swelling will go down and the breast will drop.  He said the breast could take 12-18months to soften and for the implant (under the LD Flap) to drop.  I said I felt like I had a large hard rock under the muscle of my breast that had been tightly duct taped to my body, he said I probably have a seroma under the muscle in my breast, but to be sure I would need to have an ultrasound - he thought this was pointless as he would prefer for the fluid to be absorbed naturally as draining the fluid puts you at risk of infection and the procedure may encourage my body to produce more fluid. Parts of my back that are numb, he said it could unto 12 months to regain the feeling and some of it may never return. He advise me to rub cream on my back??? I have a burning, prickly-tingly, stabbing type pain in my breast, underarm and part of my lower back (inside - not on the outside); he said this was due to the nerves having been disrupted. If I had realised some of these facts pre-op I would of probably gone for an implant rather than LD Flap reconstruction, but heho what is done is done n onwards n upwards as they say!!! I am now not due to see my consultant till June. In the afternoon I saw my phsio Mel, who I must say is lovely.......I have seen her 3 times now and she has given me lots of advise and encouragement...... she said that the discomfort (burning, prickly-tingly stabbing pain) to my breast, back and underarm are probably due to nerves healing (neuropathic) She advised me that I should go and see my GP and get different pain relief, as paracetamol and ibuprofen are not effective treatment for this type of pain, she suggested they may prescribe either Amitriptyline or Gabapentin and said that I probably won't see the benefit from these for quite a few days, but should help me for my holidays and especially the flight in 22 days time....... Having found myself allergic to nearly all the blooming painkillers the hospital tried on me (tramadol etc.) I'm just hoping I'm ok with one of these - silly, having reached 50 years young and lucky that I've never been seriously ill or had any procedures before this I find I'm even allergic to lots of medication and even the glue on steri-strips -they bought my whole back and front out in blisters!!!! crazy! Anyway, I have got an appointment with a GP this evening, so I will be sorted!!!!!! Because of my experience; 23 of my likeminded/same aged girlfriends, plus some of their family and friends (so far 42 of us) are doing the Portsmouth Race for Life this year.....Breast cancer is something that you don't even consider, but it is so easily treatable if detected early...and we just want everyone to be aware n go for their regular screening....... Thank you all for your encouragement/advise and wishes and I wish you all well.",

I was very fortunate that I did not require any further treatment other than hormone tablets, but I am very disappointed in myself and have had quite a tearful day as I am still nowhere near recovered.  My breast and underarm are still very swollen, uncomfortable and painful and my whole back still feels crackly and painful and I still feel full of fluid and find it hard to sit comfortably for any length of time.  As I have not seen my consultant, a doctor or nurse for 6 weeks I am not sure if this is normal or if I'm just not coping too well.  I am due to go on holiday (10 hours flight) in three weeks time, and at my last check up; at two weeks, my consultant confirmed that I would be ok to go on this, but I feel that there is no way I could cope with an hour flight, let alone 10 hours.  I keep thinking that suddenly one day the fluid will go and I will feel automatically more comfortable.  I don't know anyone who has had this sugary that I could ask and feel quite alone.  Please can anyone advise me on how their surgery/recovery went and advise me what I should expect at this stage.",

Because of this the nhs nurse at the hospital told me I had to go back to the consultant privately (who is in fact her boss as he is head of department at the nhs hospital), he only holds a private clinic once a week due to his full time nhs commitments, so I have to make an appointment for next wednesday!!!! I'm just getting very apprehensive about my holiday!!!! I really dont want to pull out of going because it is the whole family going;  8 of us!!!! to disneyland in florida!  Me, my husband, 30 year old son, 28 year old 13 week pregnant daughter, her partner and his twin 7 year old daughters!!!, I really don't want to have to delay as we are going for my fathers sake - he is desperate to go.  He is 4years post bladder cancer-resulting in complete bladder removal, then two major heart attacks; his consultant have told him he is able to go - and I'm so concerned that if we delay (which if we did we then couldn't go till next April due as my daughter as she will be too heavily pregnant and then the baby being born) then he may not be strong enough to go........why is nothing ever easy eh???",
