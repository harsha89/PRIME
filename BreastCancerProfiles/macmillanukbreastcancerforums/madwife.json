    "Content": "Hi Hannah, I thought being diagnosed at 44 was young enough, but 35 is just not fair! I can relate to some of your fears. One thing I learned was to ask questions if I was not sure of what was being said or what was being offered for treatment, I asked. If you do not understand why you are not having chemo therapy then ask. I was not given chemo, as in the 6 month treatment every week chemo, but was given drug therapy for 2 years two types and then one for a further 3 years, plus radio therapy. Theses drugs prevented any cancer cells using hormones to feed them, plus the drugs suppressed the hormones, therefore nothing to feed any stray cells that MAY have escaped the surgery and didn't get zapped by radiation! The diagnosis of the types of tumours and what they respond best to has advanced so much in the 12 years since I was diagnosed, the treatment is brilliantly targeted. But don't take my word for it ask them.  As to the operation, yes it is scary stuff but the nursing staff, the anaesthetist and surgeons are well aware of peoples fears, and will reassure you. Once you are asleep you will not know anything till you wake up in the ward and its all over and the cancer is not there any more!. It is not a very painful operation, well I found it so, and everyone was brilliant, and offered plenty of pain relief, not that I need it, but then I have always said in my case \"no brain no pain\"! Oh I remember reading everything and anything on the internet and scared myself witless and got very angry at some of the articles I read. I got angry because they were misleading and in some cases even blaming women for their own cancer...total lies....so be very careful what you read and take to heart. Sometimes we don't have enough knowledge of the subject to best interpret what is relevant to us, so cut down on the 4.am Google searching! Unless it is for a new recipe or knitting pattern! I think your husband must be struggling too, but men find it very difficult to discuss their emotions. If there had been a different kind of crisis in your life the two of you would of turned to each other for comfort and support, but he quite probably feels he cant' burden you with his fears and emotions as you are going through enough of your own. He needs a good close friend to speak to. It was only much later that I realised what my husband was going through. Ask him what he is feeling, discuss it.  As to you wanting a baby, you really need to talk to your consultant because it will depend on so many factors, I have heard of women having their eggs collected before treatment, then later on having IVF. This might be a long shot....but not fa reason to sit up at 4am to look on the internet! I don't know how much help I have been to you, but all I can say is I am still here 12 years later, my world isn't exactly how I had planned it but it is good! I am still married! I swim for Macmillan, in charity mile swims which I thought I would never be able to do again. Live each day as it comes and ask questions of the professionals, and hold each other tight.  All the best. Wendyxxx",
