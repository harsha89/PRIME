    "Content": "Hi Lyndy, I have a different C location to you but I have not had treatment only consultations for three months. I was worried that the tumour would grow faster than they were dealing with it, but was told these things develop over a long time. I'm sure the professionals can tell by other symptons and other patients how serious or urgent your case is. Don't panic, but do persist. The doc would not ignore your case, but neither would they scare you by over reacting.",
