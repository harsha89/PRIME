    "Content": "Hi I had a lumpectomy and after my op I went to M&S to look at their bras which I found to be exspensive and boring.  In the end I found a comfy sports type bra from Primark which I slept in and cost £4. Don't know if this is any help to you as your requiments may be different to mine having the masectomy.   Laragh x",
