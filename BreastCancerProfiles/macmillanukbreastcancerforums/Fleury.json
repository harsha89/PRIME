      "Content": "Hi I am having Zelodronic Acid infusion next week as a treatment for early post menopausal breast cancer. My oncologist said the most common side effect is flu like symptoms for 48 hours. I see one post here reports no side effects. Does anyone else have any comments? I don't know whether to cancel my commitments for those 48 hours or not. Grateful for advice",
