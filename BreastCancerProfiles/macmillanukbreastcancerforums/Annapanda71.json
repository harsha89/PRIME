      "Content": "I went for my last FEC on Monday , due to under staffing they had me down that I had all three FEC. I was sent home at the second one with an infection but they hadn't taken off my note. Nurse rang down to my consultant who said move onto the T that they had ready. Not booked to see anyone till October before next chemo.  Find it really strange that are leaving the powerful FEC out. Nurses just said oh he has cleared it that's fine! Has this happened to anyone I feel I need the full course!  Many thanks xx     ",
