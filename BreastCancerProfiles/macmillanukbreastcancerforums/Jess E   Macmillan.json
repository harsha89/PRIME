We appreciate all feedback as it helps us to grow and to support more people affected by cancer.  Please accept our apologies if the campaign has caused any upset or offence, Brave the Shave was created in order to raise awareness and vital funds for Macmillan and we understand the sensitive nature of the campaign. Brave the Shave started as we found that many Macmillan supporters were choosing to shave their head and fundraise for Macmillan. Originally we launched Shave or Style, however from this campaign, we found that the majority of participants were opting to shave and so moved forward with that aspect specifically. We wanted to provide these supporters with a better platform in order to raise money, while sharing their fundraising activity. The majority of people who take part in Brave the Shave have a close connection to cancer, including the ladies in our TV ad. We do understand that this type of event is not for everyone, which is why we offer a variety of events, including Coffee Morning, Go Sober and Summer Lights. We also of course are continually trying to improve and check our communication with this particular ask, which is why yours and participants feedback here is so important.   Last year this event raised over £4m to support people affected by cancer, which means we can continue to be there for more people affected by cancer than ever before. We hope this response has eased some of your concerns, and please do let us know if you have any further comments or queries, you can email us at bravetheshave@macmillan.org.uk",

      "Content": "Hi all, Our Brave the Shave team have written a response after reading through your comments on this discussion: 'Thank you for sharing your thoughts on Brave the Shave, we have been reading and following all your comments and are very sorry to hear that this campaign has caused upset and anger to many of you, this is absolutely not our intention. We know that deciding to shave your head for charity and losing your hair during cancer treatment are worlds apart and we are in no way trying to compare the two experiences. The majority of people taking part tell us they are doing so because a loved one has or is going through cancer and they want to do something significant to raise money for Macmillan. The purpose of our fundraising campaigns is to raise money so we can continue to provide vital services to people with cancer during treatment and beyond and this is why Brave the Shave exists. To date the event has raised over £17 million to support people living with cancer and their families.  Some of you have asked questions about where the hair from Brave the Shave goes. We actively encourage people taking part in the event to donate their hair to the Little Princess Trust by sending all participants a detailed leaflet and emails on how to go about doing this. The Little Princess Trust help us track this activity so we know that last year hair donations from Brave the Shave fundraisers helped make 43 more wigs for boys and girls across the UK and Ireland who have lost their own hair through cancer treatment and other illness. We are committed to listening to feedback and gathering thoughts from people affected by cancer about Brave the Shave. Since the event launched in 2015 we have continually used feedback to shape the event. This year we have spoken to people living with, and affected by, cancer to get a broad range of feedback and have made adjustments to the event\u2019s look and feel. Our findings have given us the confidence that Brave the Shave is an appropriate fundraising campaign for Macmillan. We realise Brave the Shave is not for everyone but I do hope this has given you some useful insights into our campaign. I will make sure that your thoughts around the campaign are taken on board as we continue to review this year\u2019s campaign.' If you have any more feedback I'd suggest using our feedback form to contact the team, as the community is primarily used for peer support and none of our fundraising team spend time on here, so it may be easily missed. Best wishes, Jess",

      "Content": "Hi both, Dreamthief - There is a 'remember me' button on the mobile site as well yes, after user feedback said this is something they'd like. Monika123 -  I understand that many people use Facebook and find it easy to use. Of course, we are always trying to find new ways to make our site easier and simpler to use for our members. One benefit to the current Online Community which Dreamthief has already mentioned, is that many users find it helpful to read the advice of others, and don't always find it necessary to post something for themselves. As a charity, we want to be open and share our knowledge and experiences with others, as this can be invaluable in itself. We take our members' privacy very seriously and this is why we don't allow full names to be used, and moderate when users post their private details such as their email addresses and phone numbers. Facebook is public, which would mean that some users would have to create separate private or 'fake' accounts to their personal ones to avoid their personal details being exposed in these groups. There are also technical limitations to using Facebook- one being that we have over 100 groups here on the community, which would mean 100 Facebook groups.  I hope this clears up some of the reasons we do this, and if you ever need to get in touch with us, the quickest way to get a response is to drop us an email at community@macmillan.org.uk and we'll be happy to answer your questions, or suggestions. All the best, Jess Macmillan community team",
