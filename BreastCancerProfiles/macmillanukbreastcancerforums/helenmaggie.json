    "Content": "Hi Hope the sickness has now lifted completely :-)Â  I've just finished chemo (6 x fec) and struggled with sickness. I was prescribed domperidone (couldn't tell that they did much) and ondansetron along with a steroid initially - I felt a marked improvement with the ondansetron. Sadly, as my cycles continued the sickness got worse and I was prescribed emend - which stopped me actually being sick but I still felt pretty grotty. I think you're right that you have to 'listen to your body' - my body seemd to want carbs - little and often! Not the healthiest diet I've every experienced but I did what I had to to get through!! make sure you mention the sickness to your oncologist - there are lots of things to try :-)",
