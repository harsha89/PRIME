    "Content": "Jane h Hi Jazmine I had my main worrying time over xmas and jan last year....the scans and the bit where you are waiting to hear ...my friends were great and i went out a lot , visits, london trip to dorset. i found those fun things helped a lot. also went on a health kick and ran most days which is always good when you dont really want to think about things. i read a lot too. Helps those sleepless nights pass easier. read the entire vera stanhope series for example. Obviously one gets other worrying times but lookinng back those were the most worrying times for me. But to be honest i am very used to blocking things from my mind. you see i lost my only son 5 yrs ago . He was killed in an accident so you do kind of get used to shutting those mental doors on stuff that is difficult. i knew i was recovering from that though because i did care about my diagnosis.  So my tip is to do things you fancy and have fun and get fitter becaause even a couple of weeks of exercise stands you in good stead should you have to go into hospital, have treatment etc. and l can certainly recommend the novelist anne cleeves. so so glad you have the capacity to fight despite the overwhelming loss of your son. I have had a recall for 2nd screening  this week  and it's on weds next week a mere 8 days from my 3 yr screen. Scan. My problem is that I have wished for a terminal illness since my sister hung herself on Halloween 2008. Now I am hoping and praying for a terminal diagnosis so I can be with my sister once again. Tell me where you get your strength from because I cannot find mine. Much love and respect  x",
