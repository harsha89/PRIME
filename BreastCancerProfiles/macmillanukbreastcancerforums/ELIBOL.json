      "Content": "Hi all bloggers, hope you are as well as you can be! I've not long had No.5 of 6 chemos for advanced breast cancer which has spread to my lymph nodes. Due to the size of original tumours (now shrunk quite a bit by chemo) I'm having surgery after chemo - probably mastectomy - then radiotherapy and I've got the consultation with the surgeon next week. Can anyone please give me advice on how long I might be in hospital? Good questions to ask the surgeon next week? How long after Radiotherapy they might do the reconstruction? All advice greatly received. Also, completely seperately, I've had 3 FEC and 2 Docetaxel, and I've always been a very 'plain' eater - no curries, indians etc for me, yet I can hardly taste some things and everything else tastes like washing up liquid (well at least I think thats what washing up liquid would taste like!) Is this normal, and if so how long after chemo do you get your taste buds back? Thanks for all you anticipated help! Keep strong Elicia xxx    ",

      "Content": "Hi again I've met Sarah and she's lovely. I've found that cotton, button up pyjamas have been great and if you need radiotherapy later they're good for having cotton next to your skin too. Mine were really cheap from Primark but they've been fine and I couldn't get cotton button-up ones anywhere else! After surgery you will have temporary 'drains' in and life will be easier if you have the buttons. One of the days I was in then ran out of 'drain bags' (that you carry the drains in for a couple of days - this lets any excess fluid disperse) so having a plastic carrier bag just in case might be an idea too. The food manager is great and if you have any special requests she'll do her best to accomodate you. Breakfast is just cereal and toast in the day room. The day room has a TV and there are 'pay' TV's by your bed. My brother bought me an iPod to use in hospital but I chatted so much to everyone else that I didn't use it once! The rooms are usually 4 to a room and there is a WC and shower for every room so you can shower etc. I had my chemo first so didn't have any hair to worry about! I know what you mean about staying in hospital - my last time was when my son was born 15 years ago, however as everyone was so lovely the time went quickly and I wasn't scared at all. Last piece of advice that I can think of is when they give you the arm exercises for after surgery, make sure you do them! I'll send you a message with my email address if you think of anything else Elicia x",

I had Mr Greenall who was excellent and a good friend had a Miss somebody or other who she said was top rate too All of the breast care nurses are great - I think I've met them all now and they're at the end of the phone for any questions on any part of your treatment. I was diagnosed at the end of March and due to having several tumours which were growing rapidly I had chemo first (6 doses) then Mastectomy in September and I'm having 5 weeks of radiotherapy now.  Have to take Tamoxifen for 5 years (quite standard) my only 'shock' was that after surgery I got told I was HER2+ which means I have Herceptin every 3 weeks for another year - it wasn't positive in the beginning but they think chemo may have changed my status. Shame as if they'd known earlier my Herceptin would have started back in August! never mind - just grateful that I'm not paying for any of these drugs. Make sure they get you the form so you don't pay for prescriptions either! Take care Elicia x",

Please can I reassure you that whatever you need you'll get there/ Every person I've met from surgeon, nurses to cleaning staff have been outstanding, professional and helpful and you'll get the best care ever. They usually appoint you a 'breast care' nurse who can guide you through everything, and there's also a 'Maggie's centre' on site. They cam all give you help with finances, hospital transport etc. If you need to know anything at all please feel free to send me a personal message   Elicia xxx",

My husbands, friend's Mum was operated on by Mr Greenall too when she was in her 90's and all went well. He is 'the daddy' as they say in his field! Not much of a bedside manner but a brilliant surgeon and the nurses are better to ask any questions you have! Take care Elicia x",

I've had a one-off infusion of Avastin (as part of a trial), the usual 6 doses of chemo then a mastectomy just over 2 weeks ago. When I got the results of the surgery this week the surgeon said I am now oestrogen negative and strongly HER2 positive! I am being referred back to Oncology as he said I'll probably now need a year of Herceptin every three weeks.  Has anybody else had a change like this? Is it normal?",

      "Content": "Most of the breast care nurses will probabl;y have all the answers to the questions before you've thought of them - sometimes it's the surgeons who are a bit vague or forgetfull! Some questions I asked: How long will the surgery take? How long will I be in hospital? Ask about chest drains Ask how long until the results and how you will be told them If you do have the implant out will they sort you out with a mastectomy bra and 'softie' Do they have written information to refer to ? As a general rule they can't tell you much for at least two weeks as they need to carry out 'histology' on the tissue they remove. They will grade it and check to see if they got it all with clear margins and whether it may have spread. This is very general but if they think there is any spread (ie to lymph nodes) that's when they usually look at chemo. Lots of people get radiotherapy 'just in case' and many women will also be put on the drug Tamoxifen.The only thing that changed for me was that at the beginning when I had a biopsy I was HER2- and after surgery they found I was HER2+ so I have to have Herceptin too for a year. Luckily it's nothing like chemo! Elicia x ",
