      "Content": "Hi My name is Sandyd joined cancerbackup only a few days ago. Not sure about blogging but I'll learn. I am sorry to hear of your wifes illness. It is so frightening for all concerened especially I'm assuming here that you both hoped beyond hope that after surgery things would improve. It is all too easy for people to say 'stay positive' when all you want to do is scream! as, as a partner you may feel helpless as I know that is what my lovely husband felt and feels. I was diagnosed in July ('08) with breast cancer with secondaries on liver, stomach, kidney tubes, bones with a shadow (whatever that means!) on the bowel. No surgery was offered. I am having chemo (Paclitaxel) weekly and another monthly treatment called zolendronic acid which is a bone thickener. This is not a cure but it sure does relieve the pain. On most days I feel aok. Unfortunately the cancer I have will not be cured but with treatments the results of the last CT scan were positive in that the cancer has shrunk and the back pain has eased. The side effects of both treatments have not been too bad. On worst days I have flu type symptoms when I just take myself to bed. A little nausea and tiredness I just go with the flow. Not sure if your wife will be offered both treatments, worth asking though. I wish you both all the luck in the world Sandy",
