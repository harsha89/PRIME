    "Content": "It was a huge relief to get an earlier OP date but this weekend I am ill. Friday night I ihad chest pains do paramedics took me to hospital. Bloods were ok just flu symptoms and BP was high so they gave me a GTN tablet and it helped. However, I've had a migraine since plus flu. Can life throw anything else at me. I am praying my migraine will go and flu by Wednesday although I will ring hospital tomorrow if I'm no better. Has anyone else been through a similar scenario?",
