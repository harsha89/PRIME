    "Content": "Hope your feeling better, I told my mum early days and she's been a great help but did have to stop taking her to appointments as I could see how worried she was. I had 2 lumpectomies then mastectomy just had my 4th chemo and really couldn't had done it without my families support. I was surprised how quickly I recovered from lumpectomy after a few weeks I felt so much better and got the full movement back in my arm so I hope you recover quickly too and get your life back on track. I think it all catches up with you as everything happens so quickly from diagnoses to operation I walked around in a bubble for a long time thinking is this really happening to me. Wishing you all then best xxx",
