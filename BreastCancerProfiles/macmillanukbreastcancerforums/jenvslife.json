      "Content": "Hi! My last chemo was nearly 6 weeks ago, which was the end of my treatment, but I keep getting really random aches and pains all over! In places where I wouldn't think to ache, like my shin and my fingers and hands. Did anyone else get this?Â  The one in my shin bothers me - it comes and goes, but has been around for a few weeks now. My BCN said it's nothing to worry about and that I could ache for months and months yet (hurray!) and it's not painful or anything. But of course there's always that worry in the back of my mind that even though I've so recently finished chemo there might be something not right with my shin. I had an MRI at the beginning of my treatment but it was only shoulders to hips. But then it could be a muscle ache not bone. Bah! It's hard not to worry! And the more I focus on it the more I feel it so it could also be my mind playing tricks on me! Jen",

      "Content": "Thank you to everyone who has responded! I am feeling much more reassured and less anxious about the EC experience now having read these responses. I think a lot of it stems from the unfamiliar - I know where I am with the paclitaxel and carboplatin, it's the thought of something new I think! I also spoke with my chemo nurse yesterday and understand what's involved much better. And I only have to go every three weeks instead of every week which is a nice bonus! I'm so happy with my port, it is the best way to have treatment (my veins are pesky things and like to hide when approached by a cannula) - so full steam ahead! Jen xx",

      "Content": "Hi there, Tomorrow is my last treatment in my third chemo cycle (I'll have had 9 weeks of weekly paclitaxel and carboplatin) and next week I'm starting the first of three cycles of EC. I had a port put in after week 3 because it was too stressful having a cannula in every week, it was taking 3 or 4 attempts and blowing veins left, right and centre! So I'm finding the port much better, but I've read that EC can scorch/irritate your veins. As the port delivers the treatment pretty much directly into the heart, I'm worried that the EC will irritate my heart. I was wondering if anyone else has had EC this way, or through a line in general, and how did you find it? I'm probably worrying too much, but I'm finding it hard not to! Thanks in advance! Jen",
