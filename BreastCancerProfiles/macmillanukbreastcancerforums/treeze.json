      "Content": "hi everyone ,i would like to share my good news.both scans are clear ,don,t have to say what a relief that was. i had totally convinced myself everything was going to come crashing down again ,the power of the mind scary.chemo starts on weds im having the ec treatment cant put my hands on my paper at the moment to spell the drugs used .no doubt by the end of it i wont need a paper to spell them.i was offered a trial but the side effects were so scary i showed it to my kids told them to read it & see what they thought all of them said please dont do it ,so we went for the standard the trial hasnt any records of any benifits as yet so that also put me off. i thought i could end up with more probs than i started with & the cancer as well.i would like to say a big thankyou for your help & advice i am so glad i found this site take care with love from treeze xxxx",

      "Content": "hi everyone, it seems to have been a long road already & i havn\"t even got to chemo yet. i was diagnoised with breast cancer on the 4th april i was told that my mamagram had shown the tumor to be three & a half centimeters which my consultant said was big.on the 9th i had a lumpectomy & the tumor was in fact a whopping 7 centimeters so i was told i needed a mastectomy i had already decieded that if that was the case i would go for a double. i had infact had pre cancer cells removed from the other ones milk ducts so felt i had to do it & try to keep myself safe the results of my mastectomy are in & they show that the cancer isn\"t in the the lymph nodes but is in the lymphatic glands of the breast ? went to see the oncologist who has asked for a bone scan & a full body scan to be done before chemo starts next week?. bone scan is tomorrow i have had back problems for two years now & i am worried sick of what the results are going to be .its really strange because i was upset about lossing my breasts of course but i had six weeks of waiting for results so i trained my mind to think of them both as cancer that made it easier . the scans though are a different matter its like someone going through my personal belongings & looking for some thing that dosn\"t belong to me if that makes sense.what happens if they find anything? the oncologist was talking in 50/50 & i had thought it was higher than that 70/30 & after all this time i am now scared .i can\"t talk to my family about it they are all worried & i feel quilty enough for putting them in this postion.i have always been the carer & now its hard for me to let go & be the cared for its so alien to me when i meet people i havn\"t seen for a while & they ask how i am i go fine how are you no mention of cancer its like its not me .the chemo is what scares me the most i think because then there is no hiding from it i will lose my hair [not going for the cold cap]i know my feelings are probably normal but is it strange that its only now i have begun to get scared . full body scan is on thursday & results of both scans on friday i feel like screaming help at the top of my voice but not sure who to shout to so i came here thank you for listening treeze xx",

      "Content": "hi jools thankyou so much for your reply . i have just started to get scared its realy strange.I think you are right once i know what i am dealing with i can cope with it . i thought the mastectomy was going to be my lowest point but as i said earlier i had just got used to thinking of my breasts as cancers & it helped me it made it easier to deal with . the scans though are a different thing its things i can\"t feel see or touch to know if everything is ok .i think its great that there is snow white & trazan in the chat rooms .i keep making silly jokes about myself & i must admit my kids have been embaressed but its a great way to release how you realy feel but in a jokey way . well jools i best go to bed now up early for the school run & then hospital for bone scan take care & thankyou again love treeze xx",

      "Content": "hi everyone thanks for the advice i will look for the chillow. At the moment i have a fan on constant but now worried if i get a chill with doing that. The chemo has really put the flushes worse now i do feel like im cooking. I will try anything my macmillian nurse said to try vitiam E & i go to see the aromatherapist once a week she suggested trying aromatherapy to try combat it a bit, also acupunture so i will try these & let you know if they work. Has anyone else had pain before chemo not related to cancer, & its disapeared with the chemo?. I had a varicose vein op in april 06 & woke after surgery in agony with my coxics they said i must have been turned wrong & was dianoised with coxidina nothing has shifted the pain untill wedsnesday had my first chemo woke up thursday morning pain free fantastic . My nurse said she has a lady who has bad arthitis & she is now walking well & she is on the same as me the ec . Its great to be able to sit down again without absoulte agony so an unexpected bounus just hope it dosnt come back again once treatment stops. Hope everyone is well thanks again for the advice with love treeze xxxxx",
