      "Content": "Hello Yes I've had appointments and a booklet from the Kent Oncology centre, definitely no mention about swimming so as you say each have their own protocols.  Really glad I started a folder and keep everything together and refer to.  Just in case I've  booked a pedicure and massage so I won't be in the water much! Off to practice my deep inspiration breath hold technique! Good luck to everyone tomorrow Love Melissa x",

      "Content": "Hi israel  I\u2019m the same dates as you but they phoned me Friday and said they want to do another ct scan on the Tuesday and could I practice deep breaths this weekend as I might have to do them from Wednesday onwards but it shouldn\u2019t make any difference to my days, because I am desperate to finish on the 27th because we go away!  I asked for early appointment times and boy have I got them mainly 8am, but mustn\u2019t grumble everyone is being lovely although I miss the breast unit in a funny way!, oncology seems way more scarey!  Finally I\u2019ve a spa day booked on Wednesday, no one had mentioned to me no swimming, should I check, I just presumed so long as I showered and moisturised I\u2019d be ok? many thanks love Mel x",
