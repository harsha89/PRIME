      "Content": "Thanks a good article. I actually took a positive step today and rang a Maggie's Centre   Spoke to  lovely lady who agreed my Cbt course online through my doctor isn't really helping. It focuses on health anxiety but I don't really have that   I think that's more someone without a diagnosis who is constantly checking which doesn't fit my real fear of recurrence. Ill probably go to Maggie's to see someone just have to arrange getting there. ",

I had some pain as there are internal stitches too but nothing major  no heavy lifting for about a week or driving for two but think that is standard for insurance. I had no major sudden symptoms. I have some hot flushes but was getting them anyway from Zoladex. Xxx. Hope it helps a bit xxx",

Your doctor doesn't seem concerned but it's great you're having it checked. If you look on Google and read you're bound to notice every symptoms going but it's far too soon to be doing that. If it was a cancer there are lots of different types and Google info will be outdated. Breast cancer is very treatable with many options but hopefully this needn't worry you.

I was diagnosed in November with aggressive grade 3 in two nodes.   I've just completed my treatment but emotionally I'm struggling on wishing I had my old life back. I won't say too much about your treatment but I do understand with the issues with your children. My youngest are 18 and 14 and I'm devastated at the thought of recurrence or leaving them. My 18 year old had extreme school anxiety and has been at home with me since 11   We are so close and he still needs me so much. Unfortunately the anxiety has passed to my younger daughter although she copes much better than him. Her anxiety was very high at my diagnosis and the school although initially supportive soon began to change when her school refusal continued.  It was a horrible time for us I was always the strong one making phone calls and attending school meetings and suddenly I couldn't do it. My husband had to step in but trying to get her to school in the mornings and dealing with his job school and my chemo was too much for us. The school were talking about fines and in fact sent us a letter to fine us both. It's awful how we got treated at this dreadful time in our lives. To avoid fine and court we removed her from school to home educate her. I know this isn't ideal and not much home educating has took place but it was the best thing at the time for us as a family. Maybe you could consider this. My daughter is starting back in September she says she wants to as will be year 10 and wants her Gcses but I am dreading it. I feel emotionally battered and scared her school refusal will start again. Just saying I understand and you can only do so much we aren't super human and sadly cancer doesn't care about our other difficulties or our children's needs. Just take it day by day and love your family as I know you do is  all we can aim for. You'll get through it message me if you need to x",

I try to train my mind now to say stop when my fear comes and push it away to think of something else. I know it sounds a bit weird but it does help. It's such early days for you don't me hard on yourself you will adjust with your treatment plan. Take care x",

I had three scans and no spread. Like you I found the lump through pain in my breast and then in the shower felt something under my arm which must have been the nodes. I was told several looked involved and even googled the word several to try and work out what the oncologist meant. It turned out only two were involved so even though I thought I could feel lots under my arm no one can really tell till surgery. Take care of yourself and take time to adjust. The support on here is amazing and while I'm here thank you to everyone who helps me here. If I can help in any way message me xx",

Before a treatment plan could be decided a full picture has to be gained therefore I had three different scans thankfully all showed no spread. Once these results were in my plan was decided which for me was mastectomy then chemo. This is normal procedure for larger cancer or node involvement so the best treatment can begin .Hope all is well for you both I'm a year and a half on now and doing well .",

Your breasts must have began some early changes due to the pregnancy could the lump be a hormonal response to them. I developed a breast abscess after my first pregnancy.

I also had my wonderful 19 year old son then 17 who came up to me every day and set up bathroom for me and told me to get showered. Talk about role reversal. I'm also doing much better though children still need sorting and I'd love a job but would love to sort them first though May be im just making excuses saying that .Love to you and keep going forward xxxx",

All scans were clear as I'm sure yours will be. Just take it a step at a time and don't dwell too much which I know is hard. The waiting is the worst isn't it. Plan treats and keep busy.

I never asked I would like to see it in a way but I've been an emotional wreck since diagnosis in November only just improving these last few months and think I would dwell on every aspect of the report. Hubby really begged me not to ask as he knows what I'd do googling everything on it !  My tumour was aggressive grade 3 and I'm small busted. It was right on the top of bust close to skin and 36 mm. I think I would have noticed this plus it hurt. Oncologist said it may have only appeared a few weeks earlier but may have been rattling around as he put it about eighteen months. I assume I wouldn't have been aware of it then though. Hope you're ok it's very hard isn'tt it. Just keep on with your treatment plan now I look back and question constantly but sadly it doesn't help me now though I understand you wanting answers x take care x",

The lady stopped me and said please rot to say that she said I was in an awful situation doing my best and was just overwhelmed with my emotions. When she found out only in March I was so bad I could hardly come downstairs or even move I was so trapped in fear she said I'd done amazing then to get to the point I am now. She really made me feel better as I felt I'd done so bad compared to others. I'm not trying to big myself up but to say our feelings are normal and completely valid. It's also fine to cry as we need a release.  Hope you have a better day and peaceful weekend xx",

      "Content": "So pleased people had such good news yesterday. I however came home in tears again . My blood pressure has always been high but they were concerned about it with chemo plus the new oncologist casually mentioned an enlarged node under my other arm and I was devastated. She said it would be nothing but worried me so much my lovely breast care nurse arranged a scan this morning. Thankfully it is just an enlarged node I have  been to doctors first thing and now have blood pressure tablets. The strain of all this is really getting to me. The oncologist also told us chemo is not a cure and the cancer can return at any number of years plus scared us with awful chemo risks feel really deflated. Does anyone know how long the usual wait is between mastectomy and chemo getting worried about this now. Thanks",

I think I've gone through all the stages of grief denial anger complete fear but now just over a year later I have a new problem I'm actually happy. Anyone who knows me on here knows I've been traumatised by this and an emotional wreck. I've spent a year googling every aspect of my diagnosis and reading other forums in desperation at times my poor family have seem me go from a happy person to a complete wreck but now I feel I've exhausted all my emotions and have started to accept it all and feel happy. The problem is I'm scared of this new feeling. I think being Aggressive Grade three in nodes I'm quite high risk of recurrence so am I silly to be happy. I was so happy before life was so good and then suddenly from Nowhere !! This massive lump appeared. It was all doom and gloom at first from oncologist and before I knew it rushed through three different body scans  thankfully no spread and mastectomy. Then chemo radiotherapy and ovary removal. I really have been traumatised so now I'm scared of this happiness. Do I just enjoy it or am I heading for a fall. Anyone else feel this. Thanks for listening x",

I was diagnosed November 2016 but I have struggled from the beginning. I'm probably doing better than ever now but it's so hard. My big i issue is recurrence fears as I think I'm quite high risk   my children are so close to me the youngest is 15 so  not babies but my 18 and 15 year old are both at home with me due to various anxiety issues. My son is 18 is inseparable from me and the thought of leaving them just breaks me.  I was 48 at diagnosis and find the insecure future's hard to cope with.  I know I have to but just want to grow old with my lovely hubby and see my children to adulthood. I didn't have or want reconstruction but it's sad sometimes putting my prosthesis on.  I do read the blogs and find they help seeing younger people dealing with this really humbled me and I tell myself to just smile and keep keeping on.  Love to all of us here xx",

I am  a regular on here and many know emotionally I've struggled so reconstruction wasn't on my agenda but now my fear is lifting a bit i suppose I feel ready to think about .It I've just told hubby I've decided to leave it and not face more surgery after this timescale and he was really pleased with that but a part of me still isn't sure .Can I ask if you need an Implant as well ?  I think it's a great decision and would love to hear how it goes  Have a restful weekend and take care xxxxx",

      "Content": "Hi kacang  that's interesting about the tendons   I've been on Anastrozole about Nine months now. I had some discomfort in my arm after doing star jump exercise don't ask !  I thought it was lymphedema starting but rang Bcn and she didn't think so and neither do I now. It hurt if I rotated my arm. The muscle at the top hurt and when I bent my elbow it hurt down my arm. I also had my fingers locking previously and suddenly realised it's probably due to Anastrozole. I googled it and think it's the arm tendons it's eased a lot now but arm still hurts when I stretch it. Not visited doctor do you think i need to. ",

This last week I've been feeling worse and worse and today I've just managed to drag myself into the shower at twelve o'clock. I ache with depression and fear I'm just never really happy. I had such a lovely life before and can't stop grieving for it. I read that you can have Ptsd after breast cancer or maybe a breakdown I'm so scared. I went to doctors and have a mild antidepressant and have rang a self referral number waiting for a call back next week.  Anyone else been in such a bad place. I'm so sorry again to post this I am amazed at every one on here xxx",

I'm still here my scans were all clear and I got through surgery chemo and radiotherapy. You'll do it one step at a time I'm sure once treatment is decided you'll feel more positive.

      "Content": "Just had clear Mri scan results over the phone after scan last week. Had clear scans in November when diagnosed but due to back pain persuaded my oncologist to do a scan although she was adamant it would be clear which it is. My tumour was Grade 3 two nodes and as many will know from my posts I've really struggled and still am. I'm on antidepressants something I thought I'd never do and at the moment finding every day hard. The problem is I want my Very Happy carefree life back and know I never can. I try hard but this awful feeling of something being wrong never goes   of course I'm pleased with the scan but sad that this will be my future now dealing with results and fear. Carolyn mentioned staring a thread on dealing with uncertainty of recurrence anyone any tips to help I'm pretty desperate. I think the grade 3 and nodes really scares me be easier otherwise. Thanks ahead. ",

Rang my BCN but she just said it was a shame as I'd been through so much and was sure it would be ok. I wanted confirmation that this can happen without being a new area of concern.

It was an awful time for me I had three types of body scans and was pushed into sheer terror .I was only 48 always so healthy no family history so like your mum i was completely floored  i have four children youngest were 13 and 17 and both suffer anxiety and don't attend school or college after many years of trying ! So I just couldn't cope with fear of leaving them. My scans all came back clear . I'm two years on now and thankfully doing well . I still do get down days it's been emotionally hard for me but these days are getting easier. Just a few ideas  i had an NHS psychologist but I didn't gel with her and only had a few sessions  i had to do a lot of digging myself which was hard when I felt so low but I found Breast Cancer Care Someone Like Me service which is excellent They have a website with contact number  They match you with a lady similar age and stage and diagnosis to you  i had a lovely lady who rang me every few weeks for nearly twelve months in the comfort of your home. I also contacted The Haven Breast Cancer Centre .They offer all kinds of support and free counselling .As I didn't live near a centre i had telephone counselling for a number of weeks .If your mum live s near one or a Maggie's Centre i believe they are excellent but if she can't than the telephone option is ideal. Much love to you and your mum xx",

Be kind to yourself and your feelings accept them and cry if you need. Just take it step by step and talk to people don't bottle it up.

He's away tonight and I still feel vulnerable as he's such support. Sometimes it's hard smiling all day for the children though my son knows when I cry. Just take it step by step.

Instead he said I'm only saying this as you've asked but I may only have two months. I walked in the room not even knowing it was cancer and walked out with that. Had to go home and face children and wait for all scans. It hadn't spread and the next time I saw him he was completely different came bounding in saying scan results were massive and he could try for a cure but think I was already traumatised. Next time I saw him he was bit down beat again. Maybe he's a bit mad !  Have to said he is actually very nice probably just not best way to handle me .",

Today is a bit of a down day but I remind myself that five month or so ago I would have seen this as an excellent day so I have progressed. I don't really see friends at the moment as I still feel angry this has happened and get jealous of their lives. Silly I know. My big issue has always been recurrence fear and leaving my children youngest ages 18 and 14. This thought breaks me. I'm doing better though but it takes time this is a huge shock and we shouldn't beat ourselves up at how we do or don't cope. I went to see Nick Cave last week he played a song called Push The Sky Away it was beautiful the lyrics are so apt and as a big music fan music gets me through a lot. When I was down this morning I just keep on pushing as the song says. Hope things improve for you and you're not alone in your feelings xx",
