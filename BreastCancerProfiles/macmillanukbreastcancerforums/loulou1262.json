      "Content": "Hi, would be great to keep in touch, does it sound awful to say its nice to speak with someone with very similar diagnosis ??(im sure you understand what I mean!!)...things tend to improve once im up and about and it has eased a little this morning.  Tbh I think some of the pain on my back is because I have to sleep on my back at the minute and its defo not my favourite position, im a lay on my front kind of girl!! I am doing my exercises but have not been using my arm as much, have been advised to use it for general day to day things as much as before? I think this may be right as I find myself holding it in a unnatural position which may contribute to the ache in my shoulder.  My work have been excellent and I am very lucky as I can work from home, I will see how things go as it does give me a bit of sanity back but dont want to interfere with healing. Do you know which chemo you will be having? I havent been told but by bcn said as I have node involvement and I am only 37 with no previous health issues I would most likely have (tac or tax??) Apparently strong stuff!!! Thankyou George and Jackie for responding, I have been reading on this site for a few weeks and have seen a number of replies from you, always helpful and knowledgeable,  I am worried about lymphoedema, any tips on how to reduce the risk ? Thank you xxx Louise",

The good news for me was my drain did eventually get removed yesterday,  after getting stuck and needing yanking out, my nerves were less than pleased shall we say!! Feel much more comfortable today so going to get my exercises done and pop to the garden centre. Take care xxxxxx",

      "Content": "Hi, I have been checking out this site after recently being diagnosed with BC, early Jan. Laid here this morning in quite a bit of pain when I saw this post which has really interested me. I also had snlb and lumpectomy on 23rd January and I recovered quite quickly, back at work the second week. Unfortunately my results confirmed out of the 3 nodes removed one was cancerous the next had a micro met and the third was clear. I did however get a clear margin!! I then have had the clearance to remove all the remaining nodes and awaiting results. I am also in much stronger pain which goes from underarm all the way round to the top of my shoulder.  Its sort of a mixture of dull ache with stong nipping feelings that can be quite intense. I also still have my drain in as I am still leaking about 75ml a day. My bcn says this is all normal and will get better but ive really been knocked by this second surgery which was last Thursday.  I also feel quite low and emotional,  hope this improves as like you I will be starting chemo in about 3-4 weeks. Take care xxx",

      "Content": "Hi ladies, thanks for the advice, funnily enough that is the exact way I slept last night, on my opposite side with cushion between legs and one to lean my arm on. I am doing the exercises and have started to use my arm in everyday activities.  I am a bit disappointed with my drain as its still filling too much to have it removed this afternoon I think. I suppose it is better draining into a bottle rather than building up under the skin...I dont think I drain very well as I am still having lumpectomy wound packed every two days as I developed a huge haematoma a week after surgery in january and consultant literally cut it out and requested it is packed so I heal from inside to out. One thing I am slightly paranoid about is my shoulder blade has a dull ache sometimes but this can turn into a burning sensation,  tbh this is where most of my feelins have been.  I had it after my initial surgery in jan but it was fading but since I had the clearance last week the feelings have intensified.  I have spoke to my bcn and she just keeps saying its normal, has anyone else felt this ?? I very rarely get any pain in my breast which I find bizarre as thats where the pesky bleeder was!! Good luck with your scan this afternoon A, your hospital must operate different to mine, they will only scan if over 4 nodes are affected, from reading different posts I think it depends on  where you live, take care xxxxxxxx",

When I asked why they had chosen this type she stated it was due to the fact one node was macro and one was micro, this I knew.. but then she said also there is the vascular invasion. I had already asked about this when my first pathology report was explained to me and told it wasn't present :(  She did go on to say they was no lymphatic invasion and I should remain positive as its chemos job to mop all these cells up. Can it really do this if they are already on the move. Is anyone on here that has had VI and come through ok? To top it off the lady who was in before me came out upset and advised me she has spread to her lungs :(, need some positivity please..... xx",

I have had to wait for a wound to heal before I can start which should be next week or the latest the week after. My initial surgery was the 23 january so its nearly 3 months. I lay here and imagine cells doing further damage which is stressing me. I know I need to be fully healed but its driving me insane... x",

Underneath my arm pit when I move it feels like its on an elastic band, I have heard of cording but does that not affect down the arm? I can only explain mine as if you put your hand under your arm pit and felt your back a little it runs straight down to the scar line from the anc...Also I have no swelling but feel like a have something under my arm. I could understand if I had swelling but nothing!! Is my mind playing funny games or has anyone felt similar? Thanks Louise xx",

I also thought about cutting my hair shorter before starting the cold cap but my bcn advised me its not necessary.  Actually she pointed out to me that if I find my hair difficult to control without styling it, which I do, I will be better leaving it so its long enough to put in a loose ponytail.  She said its more important to have hair wet with loads of conditioner and the cap to be as tight as possible.  If hair was going to fall she said it would fall whatever the length.  Also she advised me to be prepared to lose quite a bit in the first two cycles and check to see if im happy to continue. At a recent Look good, feel better session a lady was there with long hair and had minimal shedding. I think ultimately it works for some and not others and if you prepare for it to go as much as possible you will be fine, fingers crossed xxxx",

After my lumpectomy and node removal I had various pains across my back as I had a lot of nerve damage which resulted in a winged scapula...I had various teary phone calls with bcn who kept saying I was hypersensitive and the pain would subside...it has. Unfortunately for the last week I have a feeling that is not painful but more stitch like in the opposite side to surgery. Sometimes its on the side, sometimes on ribs under boob and sometimes just under at top of abdomen.  I can also feel it intermittently at the back of ribs. The feeling is not there all the time and never would affect my sleep but creeps up again every morning.. Has anyone felt this, I am googleing for hours trying to find an answer and just sit and cry sometimes thinking its spread all over that side.. I will mention it on thursday when I see my onc but he thinks I am a hypochondriac,  thing is I am one since this diagnosis.... Help please xxx",

Unfortunately I had one node with a small amount of cancer and one with a micromet. I also developed a haematoma which opened my wound and has needed packing religiously until now when they have told me its just about healed, should be ok next week. I also had a further op on the 6th march to remove the other nodes, no further spread, they were all clear. My concern is I have been given the starting date for chemo as the 17th april. My onc and bcn keep reassuring me that weeks wont make any difference andits better im fully healed before the chemo starts.  Whilst I know they have no reason to lie to me I have been going into panic mode over the last few days desperate to start.
