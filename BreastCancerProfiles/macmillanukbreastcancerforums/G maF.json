    "Content": "So sorry. I had a similar event a week ago with air bags compressing breast and rupturing the lumpectomy incision. The breast is very tender and sore. I saw the surgeon the next day for follow-up prior to the inserting of the 5 day radiation device. He wasn't happy. Yesterday the device was inserted. What can I say? It hurt it hurt it hurt!  Lying on my badly bruised side made the procedure even more difficult to tolerate.  Today I see the radiologist for calibration.  Surgeon staff say no-one ever complains about pain after having device inserted.  A stupid comment since what happened to us is not exactly common.  I go in in about 2 hours for the calibration. I don't look forward to it and hope most sincerely that the radiologist can remove some of the fluid and give my poor hurting breast some happy juice. I will do my best to tolerate almost anything to get the best treatment for my Cancer. Hope you are doing better!",
