      "Content": "I have just read you 'blog' (I think you call it !!), and I was so impressed with your attitude, and I do hope I can be of the same mind.  I was diagnosed with breast cancer in June and had a lumpectomy on 7th Sept.  with removal of 2 lymph nodes.  Fortunately I had clear margins and the lymph nodes were clear, but I have to have 3 weeks of radiotherapy which I am not looking forward to.   But I must thank my lucky stars that it is not chemo.   I am concerned that most of the blogs I read people are put on 5 years of Tamoxifen, I have been told that I will be on Anastrazole, is this one and the same ?. I have taken on board your advice and that it is do-able, at present I am a nervous wreck at times, but must learn to relax. Thank you again xxx",

      "Content": "Hello Lyn I noticed you are are just starting out too.  I am just about to have my radiotherapy for 3 weeks so I am a little nervous, and not happy about taking meds for 5 years afterwards as I am a bit of a health nut and not used to taking medication, only vitimins.   However we must go along with the medical team. I do hope all goes well with you. Mo",

      "Content": "I am in exactly the same position as you Londongurl, as I was diagnosed as DCIS, and had a lumpectomy on 7th Sept, and  they also removed a couple of lymph nodes.  A long 10 day wait to find the margins were clear as were the lymph nodes.  I am now awaiting my radiotherapy starting in a couple of weeks, and have been told I will have to have 5 years on Anastrozole, which I am not looking forward to, and am now wondering if this is necessary, they have really thrown us in a loop.  Damned if we do and damned if we don't'.    I wish I hadn;t got a choice !!! Anyway take care",
