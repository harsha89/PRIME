      "Content": "I am finding the process of battling cancer an emotional roller coaster. I had a mastectomy on 22 March 2018 and I get the results of what type of cancer I have tomorrow. I am not only frightened of the battle I face with beating cancer but how I will cope emotionally. In the past many years ago I battled mental health issues and visited a horrible black place which made me feel better off dead, and I got suicidal. I am terrified that cancer will pull into this black place. As soon as I was diagnosed (about a month ago) my GP put in a referral to the mental health team. Which I know from first hand experience is over stretched, under funded and over subscribed so I am not surprised that I have heard nothing, as I only got help last time when I got seriously ill. And I can't and won't take anti depressants as they make me even worse.  I have been looking for support and so far found Haven and I have contacted them to see if I can get help.  My question is what emotional help have you guys found useful?  Thank you. ",

      "Content": "Thank you for your suggestions and I will follow them up. Yesterday I visited Haven and now have some counselling sessions booked in. I think I will be well supported at Haven. The breast care nurse is brilliant too....I can't thank her enough.  Today I have the bone scan and next week CT scan to see if it has spread. The waiting is awful....as my mind switches from I will be ok to I am riddled with cancer.....I use distraction to stop me thinking about it. So I have started doing some art and writing....as when I get absorbed in it there is no space for the thoughts to get in.  For sure whatever I face is going to hard. I hope you are doing well and the \"black dog\" depression is on a leash and behaving it's self.  ",

I have visited Haven and have some counselling lined up.    Today I have a bone scan and next week CT to see if it has spread. So I am bit all over the place at the moment....hey I guess that is normal given the situation. ",

      "Content": "Shimmer Star.  Firstly sending a huge warm loving hug.... Families can be strange. Mine isn't the easiest. My sister and I don't get on and for years she has not made any effort to keep in contact, I have tried to keep in touch, but feel she jealous of the relationship I have with my mother. Nothing I can do about that one. My own son hasn't made an effort to visit, I just get a text now and then. He's busy and I am not a priority. That hurts. I have 2 step daughters who to be honest are really hard work who live with me. One has a drink problem, that is thankfully for now under control and the other one has huge debt...both are adults but their dad isn't keen for them to fly the nest as they clearly both have issues and need support. These stepdaughters aren't supportive or caring, it is like having lodgers living in my house....one barely speaks to me and the other one I think stole from me. So I don't look for any support where it is not there and freely offered.     I am viewing cancer as a filter....people who care will either be there or walk into my life. The strangest thing is people who I have never met are coming into my life with messages of support and love. The truth is I think we make few real friends in life. And I think we are blessed if we have 2 or 3 real friends nearby who will come over to see us at our time of need. I realise that the type of support we need plenty of people cannot give, they lack the empathy, compassion or insights. So the best we can do is reach out on platforms like this one and link into support services. I recently went to Haven and will start some counselling with them soon. And here people have been so helpful with ideas and suggestions of other organisations to approach.  The bottom line for me is I know this is my cancer and my battle...and yes I am alone in this fight. There will be others who will walk some of the path with me and hold my hand...but they cannot fight the cancer demon. In the past many years ago I battled a serious mental health condition and it took me 18 months to claw my way out of the black hole. And I am terrified cancer will pull me back there.  None of us are alone, we are connected via this platform. Via the people we meet. My advice is take what you can in the way of help, any help is better than no help. I am viewing cancer as my way to find me, as for sure the other side of cancer I will not be the same person, and I guess there will be different people in my life too the other side of cancer.  I will also have to find myself, as my life has been torn apart. Cancer has taken my business, my life's work, my passion as a horsemanship practitioner. Working with horses is too high risk while battling cancer. My whole life has changed in a few short weeks I have gone from being an outdoors person working with horses and looking after horses...to having to give them up. I feel cut a drift, lost, and who am I? So this is my time to connect with who I am...not what I can give to others.  We all are warriors here. We are all battling something apart from cancer.  Love and healing for you. xxxxx",
