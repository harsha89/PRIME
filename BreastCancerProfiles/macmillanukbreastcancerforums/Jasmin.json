      "Content": "Hi ladies Just getting over 2nd chemo it went bit better than my first thank god! Some of my tips. Sore tummy & indigestion - aloe Vera juice it's amazing & great for weight loss. Haven't put on any weight yet. Sickness - water & lemons. Constipation - day 3 post chemo take something to make you go then on day 5 when you can't go it happens, sorry for the detail :) or spicy curry. Head - baby oil it absorbs to keep it supple without greasiness . Insomnia - box sets on sky/good book. Be kind to yourself & have a good cry it's good for the soul & it just means your human. T xx",

      "Content": "Hi Lucy, I went through IVF before I start chemo & unfortunately it didn't work for me. We decided not to have another go it be honest it was far to upsetting & I wanted to be strong for the chemo. The doctor also advised that from the start of the op you should start chemo within 3 month as the ivf drugs are full of hormones & my cancer is her2 positive so it put me at a high risk! I'm 40 so there is a low chance of me getting pregnant now as I will prob start menopause, but are young & the fertility doc suggested your body does bounce back the younger you are. We were lucky to receive 1 free assistance from the nhs otherwise it would have cost Â£3500 & got nothing from it but heartache! Good luck with whatever you decide. T xx",
