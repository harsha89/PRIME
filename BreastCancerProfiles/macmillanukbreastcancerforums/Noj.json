      "Content": "Hi Luna, Sory to hear about all the trials and tribulations you have been going through. I also had an infection in my wound (as well as 2 leaks) which delayed my treatment so I understand your frustration. I'm delighted to hear you are having a port fitted. I have one but had to fight for it - I'm glad I did because on the 2 occasions when they could not access it I was given treatment via vein and those veins continue to give me some discomfort. I don't know what your build is like but I am well endowed. I asked the chap fitting the port to keep it well out of sight for me so that the scar would not show when I was wearing a v neck top. Well.... he didn't achieve it. I think he was trying to miss the line of my bra strap so that there would be no routine discomfort but he went too far to the right and the scar is now on display with many of my clothes. There may be a way you can help avoid this. They will typically put the port on the opposite side to where you had your breast surgery. My suggestion to you is that you might want to draw a couple of lines on yourself. If I had known then what I know now, I would have drawn the typical line of my bra strap (ie put on a bra and use a biro to follow the line it takes nearest your cleavage) and I'd have put on a typical top (one that exposed the most I was likely to expose) and traced another line. The area between the two lines would then give you and them a clear idea of where the scar is least likely to be seen and if they can fit it in there, I'm sure they will. To be fair - it isn't a big scar (about an inch and a half), and whilst he did a great job of sewing me up, it is still a scar and I'd have been happier if it wasn't on show. Good luck with the op. I hope chemo starts for you soon. Best wishes, Noj xxx Good luck -",

      "Content": "Hi, I had a port fitted before I started chemo.  In terms of the op, typically you are sedated with something like rohypnol - the date rape drug.  I found that I was completely aware of what was going on.  I felt everything and was able to tell them so they gave some local pain relief (even though it was not that sore) and I remembered everything afterwards.  Sensation wise - there is a lot of pushing and tugging - it is not the most pleasant procedure but really it isn't too bad.  It is most certainly worth doing.  I found that when in, my port needed a few weeks for the swelling to go down before it could be used.  Since we got it working, I've had no problems with it at all.  My suggestion would be that before the op you mark (with a pen) your 'typical' bra strap line and your (ideally most revealing) top line.  The space between these two lines is then the ideal position for your port (from a scar perspective).  If you don't do this they have to guess these positions.  I didn't know this before I had mine done and my scar is visible with several of my tops which is annoying because it could have been avoided if someone had told me. Good luck. Let us know how you get on. Noj x  ",

Node clearance is about your lymph nodes.  You say they have said yours are clear.  They may still want to do a further test which could involve what they call a centinal node biopsy.  This is where, when they remove the lump, they also take away a few lymph nodes from under your arm for further testing.  In my case, they did this and tested them while I was still under.  They offer this so that if anything is found they can remove the rest of the nodes during the same procedure (if you are clear they sew you up knowing nothing further is required there).  The reason I took this offer up was because, even though they said they thought the nodes were clear they wanted to double check and I wanted to minimise the potential number of general anaesthetics I might need.  My nodes were clear so a full clearance was not required. I know when I was first diagnosed it felt like I had been handed a death sentance.  You will find with time and some research that the outlook is not that bleak and many people survive for many many years.  I am now treating this as a bump in the road, something I will get past and things will be running smoothly again soon....  I hope you reach a similar point soon too.

      "Content": "When I was told that my veins were no good and I would need 'a line', I really didn't know what that meant.  At my next visit, having done some research, I told the doctor I wanted a Port rather than a PICC line.  He told me that it was not an option unless I went private or to a hospital with private funding that meant they could afford to do it for me.  To cut a long story short - I did not accept the decision, I pursued it within the Surrey PCT and eventually I was given my Port.  I was told that the reason they gave it to me was because they were able to justify the cost based on the expected length of my treatment.  At the time this was going on I was preparing to write a dissertation as part of my MBA.  When the chemo nurses told me they would like more people to be given the option of a port without having to fight for it, I said I would make this the topic of my dissertation.  It makes sense to me that if there is a point at which a port becomes cost effective then it should be a standard policy that those patients meeting the criteria are offered on. I have subsequently learnt quite a lot about ports and I'm continuing to learn about policy decision making within the NHS.  For example I have discovered that there is no national policy not to give ports on the NHS (as I was first told).  I have also been told that the Marsden (who do use ports) don't manage to do it because of special funding.  I have been told that the Surrey PCT does not have a policy not to give ports - in fact they have no policy relating to ports at all.  The information I have been given is that it is the decision of the clinician.  If the clinician says yes, then it will be funded.  This is totally at odds with the experience I had and so I am now on a quest to find out if the clinicians have a policy on when they will deem a port to be appropriate. I know that there are limited funds within the NHS but I also know that in certain circumstances, giving a patient a port would SAVE the NHS money.  One way to overcome the postcode (or clinician) lottery is to have NICE render a judgement on when it would be appropriate for Ports to be offered.  The NICE decision would then become a national standard (I'm checking to see if they have already done this in the hope that the issue is one of policy deployment). As I said - this is all going to form part of my dissertation which when finished I will offer to the PCT and NICE for consideration.  To do this properly - I need some help.  I need to write a couple of case studies of people who have tried to get a port.  I can use my details but I really need a second case study in order to demonstrate the lack of consistency in the process.  Ideally, I would like to use details of someone who has been unsuccessful, in order to bring the differences into sharp focus.  It would be ideal if the request was made of the Surrey PCT but if NICE has already rendered a judgement then that may not be an issue.  It would also be helpful to find someone who was offered a port on the NHS without having to fight for it.  Can you help?  I promise that I will anonomise the case studies so that your identity will not be known from what I have written (as this is important to me too).  Please let me know if you would be willing to join in with this. In addition to case studies I will be developing some questionaires to gain insight into the issues associated with PICCS and PORTS in an effort to make the impact that the treatment type has on us count for something too.  If you can help with that, please let me know so that I can then let you know when I have the questionaires ready. If I am successful in this work it will mean that more people will be able to have Ports fitted without experiencing long delays and lots of red tape.  It will mean that fewer people will have to find a way to fund this privately - because that extra expence is something that many of us just cannot afford. Please help me if you can. Many thanks, Noj x    ",

I would just take off a layer of clothes till I cooled down and then wrapped up again.... and then it clicked that these were the hot flushes people talk about.  So I'd say the key is to dress in layers and you won't have a problem.

My kids were worried about what people might think and asked me to wear a wig when I'm out with them. I've pretty much accepted I'll be taking a year out to finish my MBA and deal with this disease.... however, I also knew that I would probably do some ad hoc consulting during that time and at some point will start applying for work so I did my wig shopping early. Like you - I knew looking 'normal' would be essential. If you look at my profile pics you will see I am also more Matt Lucas than Annie Lennox! I have to say - my wig is pretty good. I always think it looks like a wig and people who knew me with my hair are aware it is very different - but people I am meeting for the first time and people I haven't seen for a long time don't seem to notice that it is a wig. I've even had some nurses and doctors double check with me because they are not sure. So.... good luck with the cold cap and the wig - if you need to wear it. For me it is my eyebrows and eyelashes that are the things I really want to hold onto...!!! Good luck. Noj x",

      "Content": "Hi Sally, I know what you mean about the loss of hair being a constant reminder. I shaved my hair off in advance of my treatment which raised a few quid for charity and enabled me to explain why I was bald.... Most days I'm perfectly fine about it but there are a few days when I wish it wasn't so. All I can suggest is that you have a good cry, get it out of your system and then decide how you will turn your thoughts from negative to positive when your head takes you in that direction. Every cloud has a silver lining... so for me when I see my bald head on a bad day I remind myself that I should celebrate that I found the lump, that treatment was available to me, that the chances of survival are getting better every day and that one day this will just be a memory and I'll have my life back. It isn't always easy to turn your negatives to positives but given that the alternative - staying negative just makes you feel more cr@p, I'd suggest it is worth developing a positive mantra of your own. Wishing you the very best of luck, Noj x",

However.... I was at a \"look good feel better\" session last week and one of the ladies there was talking about her experience. I don't know what drugs she was on but her hair looked fine even though she said it had thinned. Another lady commented on the extra time and discomfort she experienced from the cold cap. Another piped up that she had used a headband round her forehead / base of her skull to protect her hair free areas from the extreme cold and she said it made it much less painful. I'm guessing maybe something thick like a tennis sweatband rather than a cosmetic headband might work well. I would suggest you get the chemo nurses to talk through the device that you would need to wear so you could decide if something like a headband might work for you. Good luck, Noj x",

      "Content": "I am curious about how pagets is diagnosed - is it a clinical or medical diagnosis? When I found my lump I started doing research. Part of the information on Pagets is about a dry skin / rash on the nipple. I mentioned to my surgeon that the tip of my nipple had dry skin on it and he looked at me in a rather bewildered way - it was my first appointment and with no diagnosis at that point, I let it drop. I have since had the lump removed. They had to go in a second time for more tissue as they found the surrounding area was also cancerous - 2 foci - 1 grade 2 one grade 3 and amounting to about 45mm in total. When the surgeon gave me the news before passing me onto the Oncology team I asked again about Pagets. He said there was no indication that I had it. I was so delighted with his proclomation that the cancer was gone I left it at that. When the Oncology registrar asked me to describe my journey so far - I did. He agreed with my details but then said 'you missed out DCIS'. No one had mentioned DCIS to me before. I had been a little surprised that my nipple had been cut into on the second op and now I think I understand why. The second op was at the start of March and I notice that my nipple still has that bit of dry skin. I know the doctors will think I'm an idiot if I keep asking despite getting the same answer but if this isn't an indication of Pagets then what is it..... The reason I want to know is because if the cancer has been removed, why do I still have a 'pagets like' symptom. I'll be pressing for this information at my next appointment.... I think what Thrup says is absolutley right.... push for answers and don't stop until you are satisfied that the answers make sense. Good luck! Noj x Having just looked up how they diagnose... it almost seems like it doesn't matter if I have it or not.... as I'm going to be going through follow on chemo, radio & drugs etc",

I just thought I'd let you know, when my surgeon told be the lump and all known cancer tissue was gone he made a comment about it being the start of what would be a long relationship.  When I asked him to explain he said that he / his team will be seeing me every 6 months for check ups.  I think that there is at least 1 mamogram per year that goes along with that (if not 2) - so hopefully no need for you to go private.  I had my first follow up mamogram a few weeks ago now - and I'm delighted to say there was no new signs of cancer.  It was mega painfull - I think more from the Radio therapy than the surgery (but I am still very sore) so when you get booked in for your I suggest you take some painkillers before hand to help make it more bearable.  Best wishes, Noj x  ",

      "Content": "Hi Kevin, This is not the news anyone wants... but give yourself a break - it has only been 2 weeks - which is not a lot of time to come to terms with such news. I'm one of the 'lucky ones' - I've had 2 ops to remove the lump and then some more tissue (turns out I had 2 cancers in the same place) but my lymph nodes were clear. At diagnosis I felt like I had been handed a death sentence.... but after a few weeks (and lots of tears) I realised that survival rates are pretty good so I'm generally much calmer about it now. I think it it must be extremely hard for a partner to cope with such news. For that reason I didn't even tell my husband until I had a date for the first op and had managed to get myself to a point where I could say - this will be ok - without going into melt down! He seems to be coping with this completely... but when I remarked on it he said 'I'm not really but who am I to complain - you are the one that has it'. I explained to him that it was important for us to get him to a point where he really was ok with it all (or at least as ok as I am) in order for things not to fall apart should I ever need to lean on him. He now asks a few more questions and I think is finding it easier... which in turn helps me be a bit more relaxed about it all. I suspect that your wife will tell you if there is anything she needs over and above the love and support you are already providing. If you are not sure that she will then perhaps you should ask her. In terms of other support for yourself - because I know I've limited (severely) who I have told because I don't want a) for this to be all that my life is about and b) to have to worry about whether they are ok and coping with it or not - you have done absolutely the right thing by joining this forum. Here you will find lots and lots of support, advice, shoulders to cry on and even the occasional story to have a laugh at! In short it will help you get through this difficult time. Good luck on your journey to you and your family. Best wishes, Noj x",

I'm not sure how your nails are doing.  Mine have all grown back on my hands now with just one pinky finger nail being a bit too short to look normal.  My toe nails seem to be coming back a little more slowly although they are all at least 3/4 of the way back.  Taxotere can be a dreadful drug to cope with for some of us but I'll admit, I figured if it was doing such an obvious job on killing my nerves and my nails, I figured the cancer didn't stand much of a chance!

This site has had over 10,000 members and I think people come and go depending on when they feel the need for support.  I think the people using the forums are those that have internet access, have found a forum and have a want or need to join in.  I know that I have come across several patients at St Lukes who do not have computer access who are not sailing through and would really benefit from being on line.   Sorry - that all sounds all a bit rant-y but I do get cross at the people in the medical profession that don't acknowledge the part that something like this online community plays.

My advice would be to keep your nails short and treat them gently.  When the nail comes away it starts to dry out but may remain attached to the new nail growing underneath.  If this happens to you, you will notice that when you try to trim your nails it will just crumble.  I massaged oil into my hands because my skin was dry and so my finger nails coped quite well.... I didn't give my feet the same attention and so I noticed this most on my toes ( probably also because  the old nails stayed attached for longer I'm guessing because they take less abuse than our hands). Finally - I would suggest that you don't get too worked up about this.  I was told that there is only a small percentage of people that lose their nails and I think if you are one of them there is nothing you can do to stop it.  You may have painful finger tips with the treatment but the actual loss of the nail is pain free.  Good luck, Noj x  ",

The thing that is great to know is that I am now struggling to remember how truly awfull it was... not because of chemo brain but because we can't recall pain and so the memory of it quickly fades and you move on.  So know this - no matter how hard it gets you will get through it.  I think there was only about 3 days when I couldn't get out of bed throughout the whole thing.... which is not bad really considering what we are putting ourselves through. My hair has grown back straight so far and the same mix of dark and grey as before.  It is amybe an inch long in some places and today I am actually going to go and have it cut... well...  shaped really.  My hairdresser has said that this will help make sure that as it grows in, it will look like it is a style rather than just regrowth.  I'm also going to have a colour put through it, as darkening the grey will help it look thicker at this stage.... or so they tell me.  I'll let you know how I get on!

Here is the link to where my Radio planning started - just in case you want the details. http://community.macmillan.org.uk/blogs/noj/archive/2009/10/03/radiotherapy-planning-session-questions.aspx My Radio finished around the end of November.  I tried to give myself a couple of weeks to recover before going on a road trip with my mother.  My skin did break down (and become a little infected yet again!) and so I was glad to have that time to treat/repair/recover before I went away.  I then drove to Scotland and back (from Surrey) over a 5 day period and coped fine with that... so again, if tiredness is a factor, you probably recover from it quite quickly. I still feel sore, breast and bones every day and I think that is from the Radio.  I also would swear my right breast (the problem side) is hotter than my left - but that seems unlikely so long after the treatment!  They say it becomes less intrusive as time goes on....  I'm looking forward to that!

It would seem my request for a portacath was sent to the wrong primary care trust (PCT) group and has now been sent to the right PCT group who should review it on the 10th June. The committee who did review it (even though they were the wrong people) did suggest that it would not be approved (by the right people) and that I should just get on with my treatment using whatever means is offered. Having spoken to a few more people, the PCT liaison lady is starting to understand the implications (e.g. the extra 60 appointments I'll need if we go with a PICC line). She has agreed to do a high level cost benefit analysis (CBA) on Tuesday morning which she will pass to a colleague who will try to get it in front of the right committee by Wednesday (27th May) which would be much better .... I think the fact that I made this request 4 weeks ago and still have had no decision as well as that my diagnosis was in January with my ops in Feb and March ... are influencing factors (my chemo treatment should have started in APRIL at the latest) ! Adding insult to injury - this new lady has suggested that the difference in cost of the port vs. the picc line insertion is only about £480 (which I have offered to pay but apparently it is not that simple...)! So unless each picc line maintenance / flush through appointment costs less than £8, then the NHS would definitely be spending less by giving me the port!!! Aaargh!!!! I'm hoping the CBA she does on Tuesday really does demonstrate this because if it does then I should be in with a reasonable chance... (famous last words!) So, Lynn (my new champion) is going to do her thing on Tuesday morning and let me know how she gets on... then hopefully a decision can be made on the Wednesday and this time next week I might get to hear about it. I'm trying hard not to get my hopes up too high! ... my fingers have been crossed for so long I'm going to end up with them stuck that way!!! So... more waiting but I think I might just be able to see a glimmer of light at the end of this tunnel....",

      "Content": "Over xmas / new year I found a lump in my breast. In January I was diagnosed with cancer. I had an op to remove the lump and some lymph nodes in February. On analysis of the tissue they removed they discovered there was more than one cancer in my breast and they did another op in March to remove some more tissue. As far as my breast is concerned, the cancer has now been removed. Fortunately the lymph nodes were clear but the cancers were grade 2 and 3 i.e. the spreading kind. As a result it seems I need quite a bit of follow on treatment - just to be sure there is nothing lurking undetected somewhere else. The breast wound became infected a few weeks ago and I have been on major league antibiotics for the last fortnight. The hole (which is what it had become) has now gone from being 15 mm deep to about 2 mm - which is great news and it looks like the infection is gone. I'm told that my veins are no good for chemo treatment and I need a 'line' to be inserted to make the drug administration easier. Having done some research I wanted an under the skin portcath version but they have told me if I want that I have to pay privately. Not easy when you are not earning! My treatment plan - however they get it into me - is one chemo session every three weeks for 18 weeks with 2 different sets of drugs. This will be followed by an orally administered drug for a couple of weeks (or maybe more) followed by 6 - 8 weeks of radiotherapy. After that I will be on a drug called herceptin - intravenous again - once every 3 weeks for 1 year. Any delivery mechinism I have will need to be in place for at least 18 months. Is there anyone out there that has experience of a portacath or picc line that can describe the realities of each for me? While the doctor is considering his answer I am still awaiting treatment..... and the time delay is making me anxious.",

On the flushing the lines... my understanding is that because my treatment is once every three weeks that I wouldn't need additional flush throughs.. Is that correct? Part of the reason for going for this is - apart from it being invisible and allowing you to go underwater (swimming and baths), is that a picc or central line would require flushing weekly and so a portocath will save me the additional effort of c52 appointments. Was the day surgery under a general and do you know how long it took...? What are 'line ports' and how did you get 2? I think if they agree to this I might have to be very specific about what I think my needs are because the doctors are telling me nothing (as they would prefer me to have a picc line), so any advice you can give would be fantastic.",

      "Content": "Welcome to the site Tricia. After my first lumpectomy I had a leak of serous fluid from the lowest point of the wound. I was told - as was previously mentioned - this is the liquid that would normally cover a superficial wound like a graze (or a picked spot!) My wound needed daily dressing changes because the leak could not be contained and it went on for the best part of three weeks which was when they did a second op and promised to stitch me up in a way that would not leak! The doctors told me that if it had not streamed out it could have built up a large pocket of fluid inside that would either have needed draining or that could have 'solidified' and take up to a year to dissipate - so my view became - better out than in! They also told me it was nothing to be concerned about and that it would stop on its own eventually. After my second op I had no leaks and no fluid build up (but the wound did split and become infected!!! It seems if it's not one thing it's another!). I have had a look for a link to explain serous fluid and I'm afraid the best I can find is from the wiki! Not a source I would usually use however, from my discussions with nurses and doctors when it was pouring from me - it sounds about right. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seroma I'm not sure where your mother lives or whether the approach used in Surrey (where I live) is standard across the UK NHS but when I was diagnosed I was introduced to a cancer care nurse at the hospital and told if I had any questions, I could ask them. I speak to them occasionally and when I have wanted to know more about something they have offered to let me meet with them to review my pathology report that gives details of the diagnosis, and to talk through the treatment plan and the implications of the decisions that I have to make. It would be worth finding out if your mum has a similar service available to her. Perhaps you could visit together and work out with the help of the CC Nurse, what questions you need answers to. Once you know that, the CC Nurse should be able to either give you those answers or find out the answers on your behalf. Again - as has been said before, everyone\u2019s cancer is unique to them accordingly we each respond in unique ways. What I find reassuring is that, whatever the response is, i.e. when it is an unpleasant thing like constipation, nausea, dry skin etc. there is usually a way of addressing it - the key being that you need to tell the people who can help that you need help! I hope this has been of some use to you. Let us know how you get on. Wishing you and your mum the best of luck. Noj x",

The thing to really understand is the nature of the risk - how much damage could be done and what the impact of that damage might be. It might help your mum to remind her that if no-one bothered the CC nurses, they would be out of a job! They are allocated to us for a reason and they are expected to build relationships with us so that we do go to them with questions. By asking (and them answering), they gain greater insight into what patients need and want to know, and how best to explain it. It makes them a valuable and valued member of the cancer care team. By asking her questions, your mum would also be helping them and all the other people that the CC Nurses will be allocated to in the future. Maybe positioning it that way will encourage her to call them up. Best of luck. Nx",

      "Content": "Hello Hat, What a good idea to take a sleeping pill.  I rarely get a night's sleep - no matter how tired I am.  I think it is the tamoxifen hot flushes that are causing the problem now but it means that most days at work I am struggling to stay awake in the afternoon.  I really can't afford to lose this job so I think I'll have a word with my doc and see if he can prescribe something.  Re nails:  I read about nail varnish and gave it a go on my fingers.  In the end I lost all of my nails - fingers and toes.  I think if it is going to happen then nothing will stop it.... I experienced significant finger tip pain at one stage of the treatment - I recall that doing anything with my fingers hurt.  After that they started to look white/yellow under the nails - as if I had a nasty nail infection.  I also found that when I washed my hands the nails would feel spongy and damp underneath. I soon realised that the discolouration was where the nail had lifted away from the skin.  I found nail varnish was a way of improving how my hands looked as the nails really did look awfull.  People staring at a bald head I could cope with, but nasty hands.... I was glad to be able to hide them.  I used a local nail bar to get a good job done on the painting and was impressed by how long the polish lasted when done by a professional! The actual process of losing the nails is not as bad as it sounds.  I generally found that it was once the nail came away at one side that it became tricky as it would catch on things easily.  I used a finger guard and sometimes a cotton finger bandage held in place with a plaster just to get me through the worst of it - a plaster on its own isn't great because if it sticks to the nail then you can end up pulling the nail off with the plaster.  On most of my fingers, by the time the nail came off I already had a small new nail growing underneath.  I now have a full set - fingers and toes.  They are all exteremely thin and so don't generally last once they have passed the nail bed - they split and peal away... but they do just look like normal short nails.  In fact now I'm thinking about it I might just pop back to that nail bar and see if a coat of paint might give a little extra protection and smarten them up a little.  One thing I have heard about - if losing your nails is a major concern....  I heard that in France they use a similar approach to a cold cap but for finger nails.  I only heard about it because one of the doctors dashed out of an appointment with me to see what it was like when a woman - who had had something sent to her from a friend in France - was abou to use whatever it was. I must say the idea of anything that stops the treatment getting to every part of my body always made me think I would be giving the cancer somewhere to hide. But that is a judgement we all have to make when deciding on cold caps etc. I don't know what your nurses have said but mine said it was quite rare for people to loose all of their nails... so maybe you will be ok whatever you decide to do. Good luck, Noj x  ",

      "Content": "Hi Dibs, The words easy peasy lemon squeezy spring to mind! There are a few things they didn't tell me until the very start - for example on the first dose you have to be there for several hours to make sure you do not have an allergic reaction.  They also have to give you a paracetamol half an hour before you start and then drio it through over about 90 minutes (I think) so if I were you I'd check with them about how long to expect to be there but I'd say you probably need to allow at least 6 hours.  The second treatment is still at half speed - allow 2 hours.  They say it should only take 30 minutes for Herceptin - but I have not yet been out in under an hour.  I'm not sure if that is because they need to access my portacath and flush it through at the end - but I don't think so. The great news is that it is pain free and rarely has side effects.  I certainly haven't had any.  When you are on Herceptin you also have to go for Mugga scans before the 1st, 5th, 10th and 15th appointment - and I suspect one after the last.  I'm not sure if you have had one of these yet.  They are needed because Herceptin can damage the heart muscle so they keep an eye on it throughout the treatment.  My understanding is that the mugga checks the flow rate achieved by the heart and if it drops by 20% they review to determine whether to continue with the Herceptin or not.  In my case my first result was about 54 (at the start of chemo - not sure why they did it so early).  They then did another before the Herceptin started and I scored about 76.  When I learned about the 20% rule I asked which they would use as a baseline and they were unsure!  Apparently the result can vary based on whether you have drunk lots of coffee or have just done exercise etc... so I'm not sure vwhat it is really worth as a diagnostic tool ... but I guess they are convinced and that is all that matters.  Given that I want the Herceptin I suspect I'll drink a few coffees before each appointment! The mugga scan itself is done by Nuclear medicine.  You arrive and are weighed.  They give you an injection - not sure what of - and you then wait for 30 minutes and they give you a second injection - this time of the nuclear variety!  You then typically have another 5 - 10 minute wait before they lay you down on a scanner type machine.  You lay ther for anything between 15 - 45 minutes while they film your heart pumping to establish it's performance.  Once again - other that 2 injections - this is pain free.  They typically advise you that the appointment may take 90 minutes but I would allow at least 2 hours for these appointments. I hope this info is what you were looking for.  If you have any questions arising from this, just let me know. Noj x    ",

      "Content": "Hi Tally. I started my BC journey in January 2009.  I had 2 operations as the first lumpectomy didn't quite get enough.  I also had a few lymph nodes removed and they were clear - thus no further scans MRI's required.  I had a portacath fitted to help with my chemo and Herceptin treatment as I have small veins.  I had 3 FEC and 3 Docetaxel chemo sessions - everyone reacts differently to chemo.  For me FEC was a walk in the park and Docetaxel was a living hell - some people are fine with both and some have only mild effects.  What I have learned is that finding out about other people is interesting but is not worth worrying yourself about because it may not be how you react.  It is especially helpful when you then do get a reaction and you can quickly identify the cause and maybe some ways to minimise the impact. I was offered 30 Radiotherapy sessions but opted for larger doses over a shorter period (of 20 days) to avoid a clash with xmas.  With radio, the treatment continues to work for 2 weeks after the sessions finish.  My skin did 'breakdown' a bit but the local nurse gave me a cream to treat burns and it cleared it up quite quickly. I have had 4 / 18 sessions of herceptin (every 3 weeks by IV).  Herceptin can damage the heart so I've had 3 mugga scans and expect I'll need another 3 between now and when the Herceptin finishes in October. I think it is great that you have found this website.  In the early days I'm not sure how I would have coped without it.  Even now when things are getting back to 'normal' I still have the odd down day and it is great to have somewhere to turn to be supported and to give support.  There are some great people here and the amount of information and advice that is given is terrific! My advice to you is to ask all your questions of your doctors but also you can use this site to ask people what you might need to ask - it is not as if we all know this stuff at the start... but you sure learn fast when you are going through it.  Remember there are no dumb questions. Good luck with your journey.  Good luck with your results.  You are not alone - you have just joined one of the greatest supportive networks.  I'll certainly be happy to answer any questions I can if you ever want to get in touch.

      "Content": "Hi all. When I had my first discussion about Radiotherapy I was told that at my hospital there are two schools of thought on the impact of different time cycles.  One Doc likes to use a shorter cycle whilst the other prefers a longer cycle.  I had gone in thinking that a longer cycle could be gentler on the body but was unsure of whether in fact it just means that it takes longer to do the same amount of good and damage.  When questioning the oncologist he told me that 2 large international studies had shown that the detrimental side effects of the treatment were no worse for the higher dose / shorter period.  This information helped me to decide to opt for the shorter cycle. I was delighted when I was told that my Radiotherapy registrar said I could be done over 4 weeks instead of 8.  Apart from this reducing the daily visits to the hospital it also meant that I'd be feeling good by Christmas. Yesterday I had my planning session and the same registrar suggested that I rethink and go for a slightly longer period of 6 weeks instead of 4.  He said that because I have large breasts, to extend the treatment would minimise the risk of skin irritation.  Obviously I challenged him on this based on our previous conversation.  He then revealed that I had been allocated to the Dr who prefers the longer cycle.  By the time I left I had opted for the longer cycle on the basis that it is easier to cancell appointments than to make them but I was hoping that I would get some advice from people who have gone through this. I asked if there was any way to predict whether or not you were likely to suffer with the skin irritation and he said if you tend to burn in the sun then you are more likely to have a problem.  Well.... despite being dark haired (when I have hair - lol!) I have freckley fair skin and burn quite quickly.  I'm going to look for the research that I was told about but I'm also hoping your replies might give me information will help me decide to eaither keep the appointments that have been made or cancel a few in favour of the shorter period.  So.... can anyone tell me - what kind of skin you have (from a tanning perspective) and how did your skin react with the radiotherapy treatment and what period did you have your treatment over?  Thanks, Noj x      ",

      "Content": "Hi Sarah, It does rather sound like they might come off.  I think the pain you are feeling now is as bad as it gets it gets.  I think the pain is linked to the skin and nail coming away from each other.  The only bit you have not felt yet is when it seperates from the edge - which can be nothing - it just comes away, or can be a bit sore when one side has come away and the other hasn't.  When the nail eventualy comes away it tends to be pain free.  It is a bit odd.... when it is ready it almost just peals away.  You will be surprised.  I think the first one of mine to go, I just knocked my nail on something and then realised it had come off. I would suggest you just be very gentle with them.  Keep the nails short.  I'd avoid getting them soaking wet as they then take some time to dry out and there would be a bit of a risk of infection. I did have a couple of important events to go to when it happened to me and on those occasions the local nail bar put some tips on the fingers where I only had a very shor bit of nail left.  It wasn't idea and didn't last very long but it got me through when I needed my hands to look normal.   It will be worth popping into the chemist and getting some finger protectors for when you are putting your hands in water and don't want to wear full gloves. Don't be scared.  You are probably through the worst of it.  My fingers are pretty much back to normal (although I still have some numbness in both my hands and feet from the tax - but that is a different side effect!).  It sounds horrible to think you might lose your nails - but like your hair - they will grow back and you will be fine again.  It is worth it to get rid of this bast@rd disease! Good luck, Noj x          ",

      "Content": "Hi Marble1966, I found a lump of about 2.5cm which I had removed in Feb 09. On testing they discovered that the surrounding tissue was also cancerous and had encroached on my nipple. Another op and a total (including the first) of about 4.5 cm removed. The cancers were grade 2 and grade 3 but my lymph nodes were clear. There is no family history and I'm nearly 43 with 2 boys - 9 and 12, and a husband. When they told me that chemo was likely to be indicated and that I might want to discuss statistics I immediately knew I would take whatever they would offer me. My over riding sense was that I still have a lot to achieve in my life, this disease will not be a defining moment for me and I will do everything I can to make sure that it doesn't kill me. My treatment is going to be 3 rounds of FEC, 3 rounds of Taxotere, 2 weeks of Tamoxifen (seems light but that was what he said), 6-8 weeks of daily radio, 12 months Herceptin (intravenous every 3 weeks) and quarterly heart scans. I haven't gotten into a statistical analysis (surprisingly as I am highly analytical) of the difference this will make but my oncologist said if his wife had the same as me, this is the treatment he would choose. Sure... it may have been a line - but it was a reassuring one. The way I look at it is - I have never had and never (hopefully) will again have the opportunity to experience going bald - so I'm going to raise some money for charity by taking control and having it shaved off - I'm feeling like a wild and reckless teenager by doing this and all the people that don't know my real reasons are astounded! I love keeping folk on their toes... just when they thought they knew me....! I read a book as a teen that said that hair is closely linked with the ego and so shaving your head can deliver a profound and enlightening experience.... now I'll find out if that is true. The silver lining is... no more bad hair days for the next 6-12 months! I've also bought a fab wig (nicknamed Suzy Syrup) so if I need to do serious business stuff... I'm well prepared. I know I might feel sick for 18 weeks or so - but I was sick for 8 months of my first pregnancy and it didn't stop me from having a second child. In short, there are a lot of worse things that can happen in life than hair loss, sickness and all the other things that can happen with chemo - but you'd have to be living to experience them! I intend to live for a good few years yet and if I have to have 18 months of grief in order to improve my chances of that, then so be it. Finally, one of the things that using this site has taught me is that everyone's experience of chemo is different and whilst I think I know what the worst might be, I've also heard from people who have come through relatively symptom free... some having just 1 bad week in every 3 - which for me would mean just 6 bad weeks. I know I could cope with that - you could almost cope with anything for just 6 weeks. I also know that by taking this course of action, should this thing come back I won't have to beat myself up about having made a bad decision first time round. Of course you have to listen to your own heart and your own head... and I don't mean to be insensitive.... but please remember, this treatment is expensive and you wouldn't be offered it if they didn't think it was a good investment. Treating you now - taking a preventative approach - is (one assumes in their judgement) a lot cheaper than the other options which could end up being a recurrence of the disease, more ops, later treatment and the biggest cost of all, perhaps your life. You'll get lots of support from people on this site... you won't be going through this alone.... Please, please think really carefully before you say no. Noj x",

The more I hear, the more I think I should opt for the shorter treatment.  My theory is that the side effect is probably based on the cumulative amount of radiation rather than the daily dosage and the quicker it is over the more time I will have to recover from any potential side effects before Christmas - especially as they have now delayed the start by 2 days! I'll have a quick chat with the online nurses before I make my final decision but this is how I'm leaning right now. Noj x   ",

      "Content": "Hi Jeanette Sorry to hear your diagnosis but glad you have found this site. From what I can work out... everyone is different in terms of how they respond to chemo. The great news is that - it would seem - pretty much all side effects can be managed if you need them to be (which you might not!). So far I have had 3 treatments of FEC and will soon be starting my next 3 treatments of Taxotere. As far as the FEC is concerned - I have experienced a range of side effects - none of which were very bad. I have written a blog that explains everything I have been through. I have not sugar coated my experience at all because I think it is useful for people starting out to be able to see a warts and all history from someone going through it and that is why I write it. That is not to say what I have experienced, you will experience... everyone is different. Also - you might be given a different drug regime. Most of my issues have been associated with getting the drugs into me as I don't have good veins and the portacath I had fitted to address that didn't work until more recently (post op swelling and skill level being the issues there). Now that it is working, I am looking forward to a much easier process with each treatment. If you asked me today how treatment has been compared to what I expected - the answer would be - it has been a walk in the park. Yes, there have been some issues with getting the drugs in but they were short lived and quickly become a distant memory. The process of the drugs going in doesn't hurt and in my case it only takes about an hour to complete. The first treatment felt a bit like a journey into the unknown and I kept a diary of all the things I experienced so that I could be prepared for the second treatment. The second time round, because I was aware of what to expect, I prepared myself - for example, I took a painkiller in advance to ward off the headache from the anti nausea drug. I took water with me to make sure I stayed well hydrated - again to help with the headache. I was prepared to eat - little and often... as soon as I started feeling woozy I had something and quickly felt fine. The worst that has happened to me so far was around week 6 when my eyes became dry and were quite sore by the end of each day - just like when you are too tired to keep your eyes open. I eased up on my computer usage, went to the doctor and got a prescription for Viscotears, liquid gel. I used the eyedrops for a couple of days and now all seems well again. With FEC, I was told that if you suffered with 'morning sickness' during pregnancy - as I did for 8 months - then FEC would probably make me feel / be quite sick. For me this almost didn't happen at all - I think one morning I felt off colour and a slice of brown toast quickly sorted me out. I have been told that if I didn't get sick with FEC then Taxotere might prove to be pretty horrible.... well I hope to prove that one wrong too.... I'll be able to tell you in a couple of weeks. I guess what I am saying - and I think you will find from posts of others - Chemo is not the horror story experience that we all read about 10 years ago. The treatments have come a very long way and generally speaking, whilst things are likely to feel a bit off balance during the treatment period, the longer term health benefits significantly outweigh and discomfort you might experience. Life goes on pretty normally. My husband knows what I'm going through but I have not told anyone else in my family (e.g. children (ages 12 and 9), mother, sisters etc). I think the fact that I'm approaching treatment 4 of 6 and they still don't know illustrates that normal life is achievable. Based on my experience, I would say you have absolutely nothing to fear from chemo and an awful lot to gain from it. I would suggest that rather than question whether or not you should have it, that you arm yourself with information on what your treatment will be and what you might expect and prepare yourself mentally to deal with it. Then the best thing to do would be to stop worrying about it. There will nothing more you can do until you are going through it, so any worry is simply a waste of effort and best avoided. That might sound unrealistic but you might be surprised at how quickly you can get there. I wish you the very best of luck on the 4th. It would be good to keep in touch. Best wishes, Noj",

      "Content": "Hello Nanagran, Welcome to the site - although sorry you have to be here. It is very very early days for you and if you are anything like me you must be in a considerable state of shock right now. After the biopsy the doc will be able to confirm what, if any surgery is required. At that stage you will be able to guage what the physical impact of that surgery will be. Assuming it is cancer, after the surgery - when they will hopefully have removed all of the cancer - they will be able to tell you for sure what kind of follow on preventative treatment you will require. The point I am trying to make is that you will be given the information in bite size chinks - as and when it becomes available. Don't try to make any decisions just yet - you don't have enough information yet to do that. If you need a lumpectomy,you might well be in and out of hospital on the same day. Four year olds can be a bit of a handful and so you will probably need a bit of help initially if you are the only person looking after him. Don't let this put you off having the op.... having the cancer removed is a really important step. Radiotherapy, if that is the right next step for you, is often a daily treatment but my understanding is that it is typically quite a brief treatment. Once again, if your grandson has any time at nursery then you would probably be able to fit your radiotherapy in around that time slot. Once diagnosed with cancer, you are automatically covered by the disibility discrimination act and so I believe your employer is obliged to make any reasonable adjustments that you might require as a result of your condition (you may need to check the definition of reasonable adjustments but I think it should include things like giving you adequate time off for appointments etc). You are only 53 and your grandson is only 4. I'm sure you will want to be around for many years to care for him and watch him grow into a wonderful young man. Please don't write off your chances for doing that. With the treatments available today, survival rates are really good and getting better all the time. Statistics are all well and good but when you are give a 1 in 5 stat ... who knows who the 1 will be? Refusing treatment might be a little like playing Russian Roulette... and I can't believe you would want to do that. Like I said at the start - it is very early days and it must be very scary for you. But you will soon find out that there are lots of ways you can be given support through the process of getting better. If you feel like you must do something while you wait for your results then I think your time would be better spent considering how to make the necessary arrangements should you need to.... Good luck.... let us know when you get your results. Best wishes, Noj x",

      "Content": "Hi Crafty - I told my onc and he said that was interesting but gave no hint that it was a known side effect of Tamoxifen!  He suggested I go home and have a Gin and tonic (because of the quinine in the tonic)!  If I were you I wouldn't wait - I'd go back to the GP and insist on being given quinine sulphate.  It is just one tablet at night and it works really well.  Depending on how your flushes are (assuming you are getting those too) you could ask about Chlonidine Sulphate - I take 3 in the morning and 3 at night and I no longer wake up soaking or looking like I'm having a sudden heart attack or blushing like mad over nothing!!!  Good luck!

      "Content": "Hello all. A quick update.... My muscle cramps got increasingly worse and eventually I went to see my GP as I was getting very little sleep. He gave me quinine sulphate for the cramp along with clonadine hydrochloride for the hot flushes.... I must say it transformed my life! A bit of rest makes a world of difference. Hope you are all getting on ok. best wishes, Noj x",
