    "Content": "Hi , unfortunately one of the down sides of chemo, irrespect of cancer type. Is a complete change in both food taste and appetite. I have AML and treated as an in patient, mouthwash was part of the medication. Nystan I think was the norm, however. Couldn't stomach it. I was given Biotene mouthwash, it's mild unlike (Corsydol) and keeps the mouth clean and moist,  in fact I'm out of chemo over a year and I still use it, mostly as a precaution . Oh my doctor prescribes it as it's quite expensive. Most chemo has a down side my final course left me with Barratt esophagus, and it ain't a nice legacy, but I'm still here. Hope this helps , and may I wish you all the best. Colin ",
