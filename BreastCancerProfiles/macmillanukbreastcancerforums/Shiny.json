      "Content": "hi Whitby i had my hair cut to shoulder length before it started falling out then it got really painful so much it kept me awake so i buzzed it. couldn't stop rubbing the fuzz lol it still fell out but was so short it didn't feel as horrible as handfuls of the stuff.  i think it's a purely personal thing - if u can cope with the discomfort then u mite prefer to leave it as long as possible.  somebody else (sorry, i forget who) had enough round edges that they could wear a hat and still look like they had a full head of hair so they didn't buzz it. me, i missed my eyelashes way more than my hair on the other hand, no hair means amazingly quick showers good luck on the 12th",
