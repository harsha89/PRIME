Otherwise I'll obviously have to start this much earlier next year as the shavers don't feel they can stop a campaign or change to a different method once they've signed up to shaving and the supporters just get defensive of their friend for being so brave and raising so much money.  However, if Macmillan would stop the campaign or at least stop promoting it so aggressively, I do think fewer people would think of doing it in the first place.",

After a few drinks the other night, my husband confessed he thought I was being mean not to support my colleague (who's braving the shave today, which is why it's on my mind).  He's just taking the attitude that she means well and thinks she's showing solidarity for people who have had chemo (she had surgery but no other treatment), so that should have been enough for me to support her.  Even though she didn't contribute to and of my three more minor campaigns! As a result, I'm the one who's feeling isolated and wondering if I have been mean - and it will be all over my Facebook newsfeed today, needless to say.",

      "Content": "RebeccaT Evie S RebeccaT, when was your article published in the Sunday Times? Brilliant that you wrote the article and had it printed. Xx It was last year. I wrote so much more than was ever quoted. I really stressed over and over again that I was grateful for fundraisers but disliked the phrase being used. They sort of ignored that bit! Here's what I actually wrote: \"It\u2019s hard to write this without sounding like a bitter ungrateful old bag! I am not that at all and am often hesitant to comment negatively lest I appear so. Fund raising is a wonderful thing and lord knows, without it I wouldn\u2019t be here today but sometimes people get it wrong. Macmillan raise vast amounts and for this I am truly grateful but the wording this time was wrong. There is nothing brave about shaving your head! I understand it\u2019s something people frequently do in support of friends or family and that Macmillan felt it would be an opportunity missed but that word BRAVE\u2026no, it\u2019s not. Shave your head, shave your eyebrows, pull out your eyelashes, endure surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, hormone therapy and all the never ending, permanent side effects of treatment and even that\u2019s not brave. We have no choice. It\u2019s that or die\u2026not much of a choice.   This is what I wrote in the Macmillan forum:   I hate the campaign. There is nothing brave about shaving your head and I love the term \"hero martyr\". When I see people doing this I want to say \"Oh cool, well done. Now you need to have six months of chemo and surgery...not so brave now, huh?!\" I'd rather people just gave the money. When these brave souls look in the mirror do they see a shaved head, money raised and even feel a little smug? When I looked in the mirror I saw a life threatening illness. I was not aware of the Marks and Spencer Bra Strap campaign so I looked it up. Hmmm\u2026I should think it was very upsetting to those women who no longer have anything to put in a bra. Even reconstructions (as I have) don\u2019t sit well in a bra. On top of all this, the nature of social media can make it all so much worse. The \u201clook at me\u201d culture, the filtered selfies really rub it in. It\u2019s easy to take a selfie of your pretty bra strap, with your hair looking lovely and your skin soft and dewy. It reminds us of what we\u2019ve lost. Also, the amount of people joining in with trending hashtags, contributing nothing is galling. I do not wish to sound bitter nor ungrateful but if I sound resentful, I am. I cannot stress enough how grateful I am to people who raise money for research and care. Twenty years ago my cancer may well have killed me. Because of these generous people I saw my son get married, I had coffee in the garden at 6.00 am today, I will have another forty years of garden mornings with my wonderful husband (I fully intend to reach 100!) But please, don\u2019t rub it in. Don\u2019t remind me, don\u2019t make me feel a lesser woman. During my treatment I wrote this on my blog: Not angry\u2026 I\u2019ve realised it\u2019s not anger I feel, nor injustice, nor even WTF? but resentment. A couple of months ago I was unaware that I had breast cancer. I was fit and healthy, stupidly happy, had reached a very good turning point in my work and was loving it. Finances had been tight but TB and I were just getting it all sorted. Life was blooming good! I think a lot of us keep quiet about feeling like this because we should just be grateful for our treatment (and I am) but I hate that my life has been changed FOREVER. I loved it just the way it was, thank you very much xx\" But also, women who don't have the right head shape to suit the shaved look don't tend to be brave enough to shave. So how is having friends cheering you on to having a great hair cut & then having everyone tell you how wonderful you look a) brave and b) in solidarity with a woman who feels shes lost all her femininity & attractiveness, seeing more Uncle Fester than Sinead O'Connor in the mirror?",

Certainly the women I've known to do Brave the Shave have all suited the shaved look, and so all the compliments they receive add to the trivialisation of the ordeal -  and yet this greatly depends on head shape. Of course, most women will have tried short hair cuts at some point in their lives and so will have a fair idea of how they'll look. Sooo brave to invite all your friends to watch you have a great hair cut! No consideration for women whose hair makes a big difference to their looks and sense of their own femininity. And that's before you consider other aspects such as the scalp pain, no hair line, no eyebrows or lashes etc.",

Something that most people should be able to do, almost like throwing a bucket of iced water over your head. It didn't consider that being willing to do it for a short while was very different from having to lose all your hair and not knowing if, when or how it would grow back, and coping with that along with all the other side-effects & emotions that go with chemo and being diagnosed.",

I'd say their response was much more sympathetic than the one I received from Macmillan but it doesn't seem to acknowledge the fact they do give Head Shave as an option. Here's the response: I was very sorry to read about the distress caused to you and other survivors by Macmillan\u2019s recent campaign. It is never our intention to upset or offend any of our supporters, especially those that have been affected by cancer. Please accept my sincere apologies on behalf of Cancer Research UK. I would like to reassure you that we take your feedback very seriously and as such I have investigated this further for you. After discussing this with my colleagues in the fundraising team and I can confirm that to the best of our knowledge, we do not currently have a campaign encouraging supporters to shave their heads. We do however, have lots of supporters who do a voluntary sponsored head shave for us and they often do this in solidarity with a family member or friend who is undergoing treatment. It is never meant to be offensive or dismissive and I am very sorry this was not the impression we gave you. Cancer patients, past and present, are at the heart of everything we do and we would never want anyone to feel like we are trivialising your experience. We are acutely aware of the terrible side effects of certain cancer treatments and we are working hard to develop kinder and more effective treatments. Please be assured that I have passed your concerns through to our campaigns team and they will be used for future reference. I really do hope you will consider joining our Dryathlon this year, we would be so very grateful to have you on our team. Once again, please accept my profuse apologies for the offence and anguish caused to you by this. It certainly was not intentional and I hope the information I have given you will go some way to reassure you of this. If there is anything else I can do for you, or if you have any other questions or comments, please do not hesitate to get back in touch. I will be happy to help you further.",

As you see, it is partly sympathetic and says the feedback will be considered. No surprise that they've quoted how much the campaign has earned and I think that's where I disagree with many others - it doesn't usually matter how funds are raised as long as they're raised, with the one exception of when a campaign upsets or undermines the feelings of the potential beneficiaries of the funds.  Here's the response: Please accept our apologies if the campaign has caused any upset or offense, Brave the Shave was created in order to raise awareness and vital funds for Macmillan and we do understand the sensitive nature of the campaign.    Brave the Shave began after we found that more and more Macmillan supporters were choosing to shave their head and fundraise for Macmillan each year. Originally we launched this as \u2018Shave or Style\u2019, however from this campaign, we found that the majority of participants were opting to shave and so moved forward with that aspect specifically. We wanted to provide these supporters with a better platform in order to raise money, while sharing their fundraising activity. The majority of people who take part in Brave the Shave have a close connection to cancer, including the ladies in our TV ad.    We did consult with people affected by cancer when developing our campaigns and your comments will definitely reinforce our commitment to carry out a thorough piece of research on Brave the Shave with our Cancer Voice groups to ensure the messaging and tone of voice is appropriate and reflecting real people\u2019s experiences and feelings.    Last year this event raised over £4m to support people affected by cancer, which means we can continue to be there for more people affected by cancer than ever before.    We do understand that this type of event is not for everyone, which is why we offer a variety of events, including Coffee Morning, Go Sober and Summer Lights as well as challenge events and regular giving.    We also, of course, are continually trying to improve and check our communication with this particular ask, across all our fundraising which is why your feedback is so important.   Thank you once again for taking the time to get in touch. Your views are highly valued and your feedback is vital, as it gives us the opportunity to improve the way we do things and to ultimately provide a better service for people affected by cancer. I do hope that this email has gone some way to addressing your concerns",

We are all unique individuals with different opinions, experiences & outlooks on life.  Personally, even though I know I'd still be loved by those close to me, and I really don't care what others think of me or my looks - least of all complete strangers - it would be the feeling of watching my own standards literally being washed down the drain and not by my choice, that would devastate me - not worrying whether I was thought attractive by Joe Public. For these reasons, having someone I've never even met declare that 'Everyone's beautiful with or without hair' wouldn't particularly comfort me in that moment because, even though I know you mean well, to me, my opinion of how I look is far more important than yours. As others are different, perhaps they would be comforted by such a phrase or would feel some kind of 'solidarity' in the fact you had a shaved head as well - many of us wouldn't and we have a right to say so. I think most women will have tried a very short-cropped hairstyle at one time or another and we therefore have a good idea as to whether the look suits us.  Some women can look amazing with no hair, especially with the right makeup - some of us don't.  Again, perhaps it's not the case with you, but every woman who I've known 'brave the shave' has suited the look - and they had a good idea this would be the case from past short haircuts. The shave is also sometimes done like a ritual, with the shaver's friends all chanting 'Off! Off! Off!' (If that's not tasteless & insensitive, I don't know what is).  Most importantly,  it makes it seem like something anyone should be able to do - no big deal - akin to throwing a bucket of water over your head.  However, losing their hair is a big deal for many women and people claiming 'it shouldn't be - we're all the same underneath' doesn't necessarily help or show real understanding. I don't think we should try to determine 'right' from 'wrong' on here. My position of support is that I would normally agree with the philosophy 'it doesn't matter how funds are raised as long as they're raised' but I think the one exception to this is when the campaign upsets, offends or trivialises the feelings of the very people who stand to benefit.",

I did Sober October for the past two years and was surprised & appalled at the attitude of 2 work colleagues  & one neighbour. Even  though they all knew I'd had breast cancer in 2012, they suggested that staying sober for a month shouldn't take much effort unless I drink 'all the time' ie unless I have a drink problem. In general I found people seemed to admire the 'brave shavers', in addition to the runners and 'adventurers' (like doing a sky dive or climbing Ben Nevis) to be the only efforts worth praising.  As a consequence, and in support of the others on this page who also hate Brave the Shave, this year I've just completed the Cancer Research September Dryathlon instead. I only asked family and close friends to sponsor me and contributed my own savings on not buying weekend wine, saving on taxis when I went out, etc.  In this way, I still felt I'm making an annual contribution & the others are welcome to stick to their runners and shavers.",

      "Content": "Luciana1 To my mind, Michael, in his reply, is simply defending the indefensible. It's a deeply offensive campaign no matter how much it raises - and there's no saying that a better, more sensitive campaign wouldn't have raised more. Michael's reference to the funds it raises reminds me of the response you get from the far-right 'gutter' press when their lies & exaggerations are pointed out. They say it sells papers. So Macmillan are making this a similar vicious circle - while so many people want to do it and while each 'shave' seems to raise £1000+, they'll continue to promote it. So how to stop people who think they're doing a wonderful job and getting a bit of glory for themselves at the same time, from doing it?",

Then if the colleague throws hints my way, or brings the subject up in passing, I'll proceed with the other tips. In the meantime, I wondered if Macmillan read these posts? With such strength of feeling, it's not too late for many participants to cancel their shave day and accept contributions for doing so, in support of the real sufferers and survivors.",

I was wondering if anyone from this forum was either on or could join the 'Cancer Voices' team so it's great news that you might be able to get everyone's views across this way.  I also Tweeted to Macmillan that they should turn it into a 'Brave to Apologise' campaign. The Twitter team haven't responded to that one but let's hope this will be the final year of 'Brave the Shave'.",

For some reason, thy can't see that it's similar to going round in a wheelchair for a day or having their eyes taped closed and going round with sunglasses and a white stick. These activities might also give someone an insight into what it's like to be disabled or blind but no one would consider doing them because they'd be seen as insensitive. Why can't they see it's the same with Brave the Shave?",
