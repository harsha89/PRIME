      "Content": "Hi KitKat59 I have a very large bust also and finished radiotherapy on 13th December three days after finishing my skin under the breast blistered and then started to weep and peel then became infected even though I followed all the rules.  Unfortunately it can happen if you are big breasted.  I was advised by the breast care nurse to ask my GP to prescribe some Polymem dressings they really did the trick.  I only wore sleep bra's during the day and night because I found going bra less was worse because of skin touching skin.  Hope this helps.
