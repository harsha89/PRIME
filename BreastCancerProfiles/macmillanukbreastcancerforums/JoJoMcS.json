Neutrophils came up to the dizzy heights of 0.1 yesterday so kinda hoping the upward trend will continue today as this will be day 15 post last chemo & my 4th day of IV antibiotics- fingers crossed. Hope you enjoyed your catch up with your nurse friend. Jo xx",

      "Content": "Hi Aspen Could I ask how long you were in for? Ì finished my last cycle chemo on 21st Feb & thought I had dodged the neutropaenic sepsis bullet however was admitted Sun night with it- so writing this from my hospital bed at Forth Valley. My neutrophils are currently 0.0 & temp was 39 now down to 37- on IV antibiotics but anytime I stop the paracetamol it spikes back up! Trying my best not to get to frustrated with it all- I am a nurse & don't think we make the best pts!  Thanks Jo",

      "Content": "Hi Joanne Thanks very much for your reply- neutrophils came up to 0.1 so hoping this continues- maybe they just a bit slow in doin so. They haven't been able to find a source of infection yet either. Chemo certainly is the gift that keeps on giving- I truly hope this is the last one!  Good luck with the rest of your treatment.
