      "Content": "Hi Flute I'm not surprised you're having some tough days and feel like crying. I have days like that and what I've been through was a walk in the park compared to what you've been through. I've only had treatment (chemo, WLE, full ANC & rads) with the full support of a husband, 2 grown up children (one still at home & one nearby) and their partners and have been off work now for nearly 18 months. It does take a long time to find the new you - I'm still looking! As others have said local support groups can be really good as as it's good to be able to talk to people who really understand what you are going through. You are most definitely not alone. Bongo - I'm just down the road from you. I live in Kingswinford (well Wall Heath!) Take care Hilary x  ",

Yes I'm another one of Dr A's.  I think I've accepted your friend request (I'm not too good with technology!). I agree it would be good to meet up. Hilary.",
