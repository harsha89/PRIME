      "Content": "Hi Betty Poor you, what a dreadful experience! I am just at the start of my chemo journey having had my first FEC 10 days ago. I have a redness/soreness  in my arm which my bcn tells me is a swelling to the vein, I have been prescribed some cream which I will collect tomorrow. She has told me not to be concerned as this is fairly common. However, I am concerned that if my veins are complaining after first FEC what will they be like after 3rd Tax? My diagnosis is fairly similar to yours...5cm invasive lobular, grade 3 and 10 out of 11 lymph nodes. I had a mastectomy with LD flap reconstruction 7 weeks ago and still have problems with seroma (to be fair, this was improving until this week...probably down to the chemo!). I actually feel better than I have for a long time...surely due to the fact that I no longer have a cancerous tumour growing inside my breast? Also I have lost a stone in weight since my diagnosis 10 weeks ago, given up smoking and am taking daily exercise. You have been through so much already, and are almost at the end of your treatment plan...stay positive and I hope your arm gets better soon Take care Pauline x",

      "Content": "Hi Sue I'm right there with you. Had a mastectomy on 28th Dec - 5cm grade 3  tumour and 10/11 lymph nodes affected!!! As MD of company had put my tiredness down to stress and overwork...clearly not just that! Have been off work since 16th Dec and feel more relaxed than I have for years (although it was difficult to distance myself those first couple of weeks). Despite trying to quit smoking since I was first diagnosed (5th Dec), I was unsuccessful until I was admitted to hospital for my op. I guess that week of being unable to smoke gave me the kick-start I needed. I have now been smoke free for four weeks :-) - this is the longest I've not smoked since I was pregnant (18 years ago), and I can honestly say I have no cravings - I am amazed! I will find out today when chemo is due to start - probably next week. I am trying to stay positive - no work stress, not smoking, great support from friends, but realise this journey will be long and hard and above all, one that I have to do by myself (although friends support can help). When I get down, I remind myself that I am a strong successful woman, and failure is not an option - I then picture myself at my son's graduation, his wedding and playing with my grandchildren - I do not intend to miss these events. I have proof of the power of the mind over the body - my mind has decided I mustn't smoke, and my body has not had withdrawal. Therefore, I just need my mind to convince my body I have another 20-30 years to live! Simples :-) Good luck to you and big hugs Pauline  ",
