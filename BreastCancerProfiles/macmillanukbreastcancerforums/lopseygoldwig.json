      "Content": "in 2009 i was told i had  fibroadenoma 2 tumours benign and that it was fine dont worry but come back if it gets bigger. I was 37 yrs old.   2012 diagnosed with 2.5cm stage 2 invasive breast cancer no lymph node involvment treatment will be lumpectomy radiation tamoxefen . well lumpectomy sentinal node biopsy came back 4cm tumour no clear margins one node positive. second op still no clear margin bylateraly third op full node clearance another tumour removed. results 3 nodes positive 7cm of tumour altogether taken out and still no clear margin latteraly and now no clear margin horizontaly . I had a ct scan monday and im seeing oncologist today to start chemo soon . ive been told that ill have 4mths of chemo not the original 6 i was told before and then ill have a masectomy radiation to the chest wall and then reconstruction. my consultant said that the mammagram and ultrasound didnt pick half of what they found up.  That didnt get there overnight and i cant help but wonder if my diagnosis in 2009 was wrong. I know they didnt send it off because they called me within 48hrs to tell me .  please excuse my spelling ladies xxxxx just wondered if anybody has had something similiar.",

      "Content": "hi joanie jelley Im sorry to read that you have metastisized breast cancer and i truly wish you well in all future treatments. I believe that they are a precancerous tumour and my step sister in amarica also a doctor all be it doesnt specialise in cancer said that things like that are generaly removed anyway to be safer rather than sorry later. It just makes me wonder how long this cancer has been in me and the fact ive still got it after 3 ops the third op i pointed out the second lump that they thought at 1st op was just dence tissue wich turned out to be yet another malignent tumour. I hope it hasnt spread anywhere else but im not holding my breath. The first team of specialists are not the team i see now so i cant blame them and i feel there a little more surprised than me but we know our own bodies. Thanx for your reply my lovely big hugs xxxxx",

      "Content": "hi alipotter i wish you well in all your treatments and im sorry we are having this conversation but i was not taken seriously because i was 37 you were 32 so statisticaly we were supposed to be too young. surely its cheaper to remove these tumours benign or not then end up paying for chemo operations and radiotherapy hormone therapy bla bla later. I feel i want to scream at them but feel torn between the devil and the deep blue sea these are different specialists so its not there fault and not only that im relying on them to treat me so dont want to upset the apple cart so to speak . However im going to put my point across next time i see my consultant .  Thanx for your reply my love big hugs xxxx",

      "Content": "If your tumour is contained in the breast and is just so aggressive surely it makes more sense to take it off . You must be so worried and i know its loosing a breast but its gaining a more peacfull state of mind .  I know everybody is different and treatment plans are different for everybody. I always thought shrinking a tumour was perhaps not everything but alot to do with conserving the breast so if your happy for a boob off i dont see whats stopping them. Good luck xxxxxxxx lets us know how you get on",
