      "Content": "Hi, Last year my Mum was told that she had breast cancer, she went through first surgery to remove lump, then chemo, radio and breast removed. All seemed to be going well, she has been still having herceptin treatment, but over the last month she has had this really sore red patch on her chest where her breast was removed, she saw GP he gave her steroid cream. Today she had to go for herceptin at the hospital so asked about mark, they all seem to be very worried about it and she now has to go on Monday to see someone, as they think that her cancer may have returned. It has been a horrid time as well as my Mum with cancer my Dad has been fighting Bowel cancer, but sadly it has spread to liver, lungs and kidney too. I do feel that I just can't deal with anything else. Thank you. Dawn65",

      "Content": "Hi Rachel, Thank you so much it is really nice to have people to chat to. I was able to talk my mum's nurse who is looking after her this morning.  She told me that the Doctors has found some small lumps in the red area on her chest, so it's sounding good news. I hope your mum's treatment is going ok, my love to you both. I am always here if you need to chat. Thanks Amanda. x",

      "Content": "Hi. Sorry i haven't been in touch but things have been hectic. My Mum's Cancer has come back and growing. The red patch on her chest is getting bigger, we were also told that it has now spread to her lung, 3 spots on her lung. Mum has now started chemo again, tablet form this time. She has just had a bone scan to make sure that it has not spread to her bones as well. Bye for now. Dawn. xxx  ",

      "Content": "Hi Kaz, Thank you for your nice reply. It is very difficult some days but I just take 1 day at a time. Both are dealing with this awful thing well, but both not trying to upset each other, that's where I come in. I will come back on Monday to let you know how things went. I did manage to speak to Mum's nurse this morning and she said that they are concerned about her. Take care, love Amanda x",
