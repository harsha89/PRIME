      "Content": "Hi  Thanks for your comments. I guess it's fear of side effects especially the long term ones. I am grade 1 invasive ductal carcinoma, hormone receptive and sentinal ymph node positive so had lymph node clearance on 17 Jan.  I had a masectomy on 13th December with expander implant reconstruction.   I am fit and healthy and recovered quick from both ops so hope if I decide on chemo being fit and keeping fit will get me through it. Good to hear you got on with life through it.",

Met with oncologist last week and she has sent me away to discuss with friends and family - I am a week down the line and still don't know what to do, I meet with her again on 6th March with my decision. Anybody else in this situation at the moment?  If so have you decided which way to go? thanks",
