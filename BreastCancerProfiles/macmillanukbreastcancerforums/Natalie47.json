      "Content": "Hi Jools, Thank you for your advice. To be honest, I am not sleeping well since the discussion with my oncologist. I am from Toronto, Canada and he is one of the top oncologists here...But his approach to my particular case seems strange, to say the least. I felt like I was begging him to give me some treatment that was not necessary, that I was undereducated or mis-informed. I have to say that I have MD Diploma form Ukraine and I am an Ultrasound Sonographer here in Canada. He knew everything regarding my educational background and yet was the way he was. Thanks God , my GP gave me a referral for second opinion and genetic testing without any hesitation. I just hope that I will have this appointment in January. Have a very Merry Christmas and God bless you and your family! Natalie.",

      "Content": "Hi everybody, I was diagnosed with Lt breast invasive ductal carcinoma 1.5 cm, grade1, ER+, PR+, HER2-.Family history-my mother's sister had breast CA at the age 60-survival, Mom-past away from uterine CA at the age 73. I had double mastectomy by my choice and it turned out to be a wise decision, since my pathology report came with areas of DCIS, LCIS and ALH in both breasts. Now I am recovering from surgery and had my first appointment with oncologist recently. He said that because my tumor was caught early, I didn't have any lymph nodes involved, it was a low gade cancer, I did double mastectomy, and my family history was not a high risk, I should not have any further treatment. He also gave me some statistics that if I do not have any treatment my chances of cancer relapse in 10 years would be 18%. If I have hormonal therapy- chances of a relapse-11%, if chemo-8%, if both-5%. I said that 18% was a scary number for me and asked him about Tamoxifen, he said that I do not need it because of the type of my surgery and a low grade tumor. I am really confused, since I am premenopausal, periods are regular and my cancer ER+,PR+. My family doctor advised me to go for a second opinion and for genetic testing.If anyone had similar experience or may give me a professional advise I will really appreciate it. Thank you. Natalie.",
