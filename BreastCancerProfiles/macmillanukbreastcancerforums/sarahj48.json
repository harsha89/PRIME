      "Content": "Hi all 14 days post 4th FEC. My energy levels are on the up again at last but I seem to get tired so easily. My hair has started to grow back but still more bald than not so shaved it again to avoid the scabby look . what was growing back was white so looks like im going to have to get used to a whole new look lol. 48 and im going to have more grey hair than my 68 year old mum. Got the whole mastectomy or another lumpectomy debate in my head at the moment. The onco has said a lumpectomy should be possible but I don't know whether its worth the risk. The first tumour didn't  act normally and onco admitted they didn't know what they were dealing with. They cant be sure that the second tumour wasn't acting up in the same way even though the tumours were different primaries. The second tumour also reared its ugly head only 3 weeks after surgery to get clear margins. My head is telling me that a mastectomy is probably my best option for peace of mind as well as anything else. I know this is a decision only I can make but I would appreciate some feedback. thanks Sarah",

I wont be making that cake again for a while. im certainly glad I don't drive lol I would be an accident waiting to happen. I used to think baby brain was bad.",

I'm tired longer ( well into second week ) I'm having to pace myself take my time. I'm having chemo through a canula so its getting harder to find a decent vein. I've never had nausea so cant say if that will get worse. a positive attitude is a great help. Its amazing what a difference it does make. sarah",

I've finished chemo and had a mastectomy 12 days ago. Its all doable. Try to arrange for someone to take the kids in and pick them up at short notice during chemo cos you wont always have the strength to do it yourself. A support network is a must and keep the school up to date. My kids have been very supportive and understanding. They've been a true blessing   sarah",
