    "Content": "Hi, This wont be of any help at all but my Mum is in a similar situation. She reacted to Rituximab when having her first chemo for Non Hodgkins. She ended up in A+E also. Apparently she was the less than 1% who react that badly. So shes also in the position of waiting to find out if she has that particular drug anymore or not. She will still get to have her chemo drugs its just a question around that one. Hope you find some answers soon ad you know whats gunna happen next. Bex",
