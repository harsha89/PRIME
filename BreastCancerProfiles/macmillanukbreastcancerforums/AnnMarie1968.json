    "Content": "Dear fiddlesticks Every cancer is individual as are treatment plans. I am on my last day of radiotherapy and the road has certainly been a tough one. I share your worries about the current ads and get really concerned for my teenage girls watching them - from my experience I had lumpectomy and 2 nodes removed too it hadn't spread to my lymph nodes and I was one of the lucky ones (if any of us are lucky) to have oestrogen responsive cancer so didn't need chemo. Hope you take care and wishing you all the best for your treatment plan xxxxxx Ann-Marie",
