    "Content": "Hi - I was diagnosed with invasive ductual cancer (apparently the most common type - always knew I was common!) 2 weeks ago. Am having a total mastectomy on 23 Oct with immediate reconstruction, so thats good! Not looking forward to 6 sessions of chemo afterwards as have been told my hair will fall out. Still, better health than beauty ay? Not sure how I feel coz I feel so well and not ill! Am thinking positive though as I am more than sure I will beat this b*****d thing xx",
