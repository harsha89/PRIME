      "Content": "Hi green machine.  I am not long finished radiotherapy and got the sunburn, itch and a little thickening of skin just like the skin of chicken. Radiotherapists and oncologist were adament about not using perfumed soap, talc and deoderent. Since I am allergic to simple soap I had a problem and was given the aqueous cream. I stated attending a hoeopathist who advised me to use Aloe Vere Gel on my skin. I bought some from Forever Living Products via a website called Aloe from Me. It was wonderfully cooling and cleared up the itch and tough skin. It was very pure with no perfume and did not react to the  Linear acceleraor rays. Hope this helps. M",

      "Content": "I had a treatment for Breast Cancer about 18 months ago and was advised to take Tamoxifen as my Cancer was oestrogen and progesterone positive. I got the usual side effects as my body adjusted to the drug. Round about June 2011 I began having low moods and became a bit intolerant and I suspect that I might have depression. The Cancer Psychologist I see and my GP say that they do not think that I am depressed but I certainly feel very low at times. Has anybody had anything similar. Maree",

      "Content": "It depends on what the team find what they do. I had a lumpectomy in August 2010. The tumour was under 2cm and had not spread to the Lymph nodes so I did not need Chemo and was given 15 treatments of Radiotherapy. Because my tumour was oestrogen + I am now on a course of Tamoxifen for 5 years. This is causing me problems. Hope this helps. I also know of someone who was advised to have chemo and Radiotherapy given week about. She refused this and was given a longer course of Radiotherapy. M",

      "Content": "  I use Vagifem and it has made a great deal of difference to my sex life. Sex had become so very painful as a result of side effects from Tamoxifen. My Consultant told me that it was fine to use this as it is localised given in the form of a pessary. My cancer was a stage 1 ICD and was oestrogen positive. It was quality of life that I was looking for and each person has to weigh up the facts and decide what is correct for them.   Best wishes, Maree",

      "Content": "Hi there, I am the same as you as it is a year since my life was turned upside down. I told my GP that I was lucky as things could have been a lot worse and was staggered to have the reply that I was not as lucky as some. This week I am going for my 1st check with the consultant and  the next day I have my first mammogram. A little bit back to front I feel but they may have their reasons for doing this. Who knows!. I am apprehensive about the mammogram as my breast is still a little tender after the bashing it received. I have been looking to see if there is an alternative to the mammogram and the internet  seems to say that the mammogram is the standard treatment for aftercare. I guess the radiographers are used to people in our situation and will be sympathetic to our plight so we must emphasise how tender our breast is so that they know to be gentle. I too will be nervous as I wait for the result. We just have to grin and bear it and keep our chins up. Will be thinking of you. M",
