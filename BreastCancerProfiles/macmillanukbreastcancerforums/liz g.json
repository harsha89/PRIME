      "Content": "i was told last march (whilst living in the states) that i had secondary tumours in my liver and uterus, from diagnosis to histerectomy and liver biopsy took a week and i must say they were very good, they told me i had 5 large tumours in my liver ranging from size of a golf ball to a tennis ball,they told me i would have 3 to 4 months to live and when i asked about chemo they said that they were too advanced, and that if i wanted to die at home i should go immediatly as i would very quickly be too ill to travel, this came as a great shock as you can imagine, i didn`t even feel ill although i had bee bleeding for 6 weeks and unknown to me i had lost 4 pints of blood, ooops sorry getting off the point,anyway i came home and my lovely oncologist said that i was too young not to have a go as apart from the cancer i am very fit and strong, well it is 11 months later so that tells a story in itself, he gave me 8 fec 100, and arimidex, and the tumours have shrunk a great deal. he saind when they start growing again he is going to give me taxotere, possibly 12 to 14 of them,i had my last fec in sept , my hair is growing back, and i really do feel quite well, i keep telling friends and family if the docs wern`t telling me how ill i was i wouldn`t know it. sorry for being so long winded, but it is really worth trying,i`m hoping to see my first grandchild due in sept if i hadn`t had chemo i wouldn`t have seen my daughter getting married then pregnant, or my 30th anniversaryso it`s a resounding yes. good luck for mum x",

      "Content": "the arimidex is VERY important!. it stops the oestrogen, tell your mum to put e45 on the area everyday till she gets marked up for her rads, i was advised to do this and got through 25 sessions without bother. every cancer is different, and even people who have the same get different treatments according to how advanced etc. i was told there are 20 ifferent types of breast cancer, tell your mum not to listen to the stories people will tell her, when i was first dx, there were so many people that couldnt help but tell me of they`re \"friends\" orrible deaths, lol i kid you not . please read my blog in the breast cancer forum about scan etc, or click on my picture and go to my profile and then my blogs. scans and blood tests are very important. good luck for your mum. liz x",

      "Content": "i, like janet was not offered chemo in 99, i had lumpectomy nodes not involved, rads, tamoxifen for 5 years, bylatteral masectomy in 2004, as preventive measure, then in 2008, they dx mets in liver and uterus and given 3 to 4 mths to live, im still here only because of the chemo giving me extra time, my mum had masectomy with 20 nodes involved in 2000, given chemo, nov 2008 scan showed her body is cancer free seems to me chemo saved my mums life and maybe couldve saved mine had i been given the choice,so what you feel sick so what you lose your hair, what price do you put on your life.",

      "Content": "all cancers are confusing.... b,c as far as i am aware has 20 different types, i think even the docs get confused (only joking) you can probably tell by all the different stories that it is different for everyone.... even those of us who have the same type of cancer it can be different, me and my mum have both got infiltrating lobular.... mum suffered really badly with her chemo , yet mine was the same but a much stronger dose and i only had 1 to 1 1/2 bad weeks out`ve 3 and the more i got (i got 8 fec 100) vthe quicker i recovered. my first oncologist (i`ve had 3 with living in different places) told me when i asked questions he couldn`t answer.......if we knew all there is to know about cancer we wouldnt have to try to cure it.....we would prevent it,...... never a truer word eh?. your in the right place jackie.... everyone on here are great support.... its just we don`t have all the answers ........YET.... lol, good luck everyone. liz xxx",
