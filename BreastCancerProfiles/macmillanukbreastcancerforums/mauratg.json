    "Content": "Hi Toni I had bilateral mx in Feb and started 6 FEC in March,  I choose to stop after 4 as the se were so bad it was really affecting me and I couldn't do any more.  When I discussed it with my oncologist all he said was that research showed 6 sessions were better than 3, but couldn't say anything definite about having 4 sessions.  I think we all do what we can to fight this and go with what the doctors say, as well as what your gut feeling is.
