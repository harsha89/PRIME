      "Content": "Hi,I had left mastectomy in 2011 with lymph node removal,chemo and r/therapy. Had the usual ct scan to check for spread,which they said had spread to my pelvis ribs and spine,my organs were fine. So they then gave me a MRI and then told me they had made a mistake in diagnosis and that I had Osteopoikilosis or spotty bone disease. But when I have read stuff about it, it seems that it is very easy to miss metastases, because they mimic each other or metastases can be hidden within the Osteopikilosis.  I do attend a very good cancer unit in my hospital,but I can't help but worry that they might of missed something. Should i get a second opinion,how do I go about it? Does  anybody else know any one who has gone through the same thing,haven't been able to find any one online in UK who has been diagnosed with this.  Sheila",

      "Content": "3 years down the line from my breast cancer diagnosis,through mastectomy and chemonand r/t. Recently changed from Tamoxifen to Letrozole. But the last 4 months finding my jeans and trousers are looser, now having to wear a belt with them,but not actually losing any weight, I feel thinner though. Worrying I might have something wrong. I have had a Bone profile blood test not long ago,that came back normal.  Wondering if IBS gives you this effect. Any ideas. Sheila",

      "Content": "Hi Misteymoley I was worried that the cancer might have spread,but having my bone profile coming back normal,knew it wouldn't be my bones. My scales say I haven't lost weight but my trousers are really loose. I am probably sounding a bit paranoid and not nearly as bad as others on here.  I will make an  appointment if it will stop me worrying. Thank you Sheila",

Been light headed with a stiff neck and got a tender Breast bone is that normal. Or should I get that checked. ",

      "Content": "Hi Deegismo Have you been given any arm exercises to do by a physio? I had axillary clearance and mastectomy on 13th sept,and was given arm exercises to do. I am still sore under my arm,but better than it was,could not bear to have clothes against my arm,feels like sunburn,very sensitive,to do with damage to nerve endings,but its getting better. If you have exercises got to keep on with them,or it can get worse. sheila",

And the \"sunburn\" sensation has eased off as well, though I am still not comfortable wearing a bra with my softie for any length of time as it makes under my arm sore,only wear it to go out or if I have visitors,then it comes off,Ah,that's comfort.  Hope you soon feel a bit better.

      "Content": "Hi Ruby, It was a good job you did not know about it while you were at the checkout, I would of had to legged it out of the shop smartish if I had known. Its a good job we can laugh about some things,a lot of people including my husband think I am being very brave, I think some people don't understand how well you seem to be after surgery,and how normal you are. I had my moment of crying when I was first diagnosed now I just deal with it as it comes,having a CT scan on Thursday on Liver and Lungs,scared for the results. After,chemo,rad and hormone treatment.  Funny story happened in my supermarket where I work,not connected to this topic,but thought it was funny! Couple was seen down the meat aisle,lady wearing a skirt,suddenly her knickers fell down around her  ankles,she promptly stepped out of them and walked off leaving them on the floor! (not sexy skimpy ones either)staff were to gobsmacked to say anything.",
