      "Content": "Hi sal thankyou so much for you're reply. I have always been prone to depression its just got much worse since diagnosis. I just seem to attract bad luck. My partner died in tragic circumstances 17 years ago i had lots of counselling after that i still worked tho i only took a week off.  Its not my friends who ask about work its just people where i live.  Ive lost 2 really good friends because they couldnt understand. The work thing i have completely lost my confidence i dont go anywhere without my partner or daughter. I do think im paranoid sometimes it stems from what people said to me early on telling me how lucky i was that my partner didnt leave after my mastectomy. Also i never used to be fat i was 3 stone overweight im losing a little now since tamoxifen so hoping that continues. Also i see a dermatologist for a facial condition which stops me leaving the house for weeks at a time so that gets me down. My whole face burns goes bright red then peels off leaving lovely smooth skin but the pain is so bad.  This happens nearly every month so three weeks i look ok then one week i look like shrek. My face and eyes swell up too. Ive seen a clinical pyscologist but missed an appointment i rang to arrange another but havent heard back yet.  Ive been to c a but its so complicated when you are self employed. Im feeling nervous about my diep flap coming up in january to plus the worry of christmas. So much going on. Saying all this i have a lot to be thankful for i have my partner two beautiful daughters my partner has a son to i love them all. I just feel so guilty everyones lives have changed since i got this. My youngest daughter is such a great comfort to me though and very grown u for her age. I just want to be me again. Just want to say that you are an amazing lady sal so supportive to all of us here. I really appreciate you taking the time to reply. Thankyou so much. Xx",

      "Content": "Hi all struggling to sleep so much going on. Nearly 2 years for me end of this month. My life just seems to get harder every day. I have a partner a 14 year old at home and im so lonely. Nearly all my friends have given up on me no contact at all. As strange as it sounds it seemed like they were jealous i was off work. I have worked since i was 14 was a single mother for around ten years but always worked. I get so fed up with people asking when im going back to work. I really wish i could im having diep flap in january and im sure people are jealous about that its ridiculous i dont see it as plastic surgery more putting me back together. Im terrified of the op but terrified for my mental state if i dont do it. My partner has tried his best to look after our little family but he has lots of work problems to cope with he could be out of work soon hes self employed. Being self employed makes things difficult with regard to finances. We have lots of problems with our elderly parents to no support. Oh and now the car is playing up i dont go far anyway havent been able to go out on my own lately. Just so down with it all just need a little bit of luck . So sorry to moan ladies i know i should be grateful for alot of things just hard at the moment when everything and everyone seems to be against us. ",

      "Content": "Bless you mr sox thankyou so much for you're lovely reply. So sorry about you're parents and you're sisters. I have a sister in nz who came to stay with me for four months while i had op and first few chemo. She had breast cancer over 10 years ago now. What you are saying about parents is very true only a month ago a lady was diagnosed in a shop i go to sometimes. My mam asked how she was she didnt seem herself she said i have breast cancer. Then my mother replies yes i know what its like we have been thru it with my daughter. Argh!! I was so angry now granted shes 82 but my own mother has never had a nice word to say about me. All thru chemo she sent nasty messages i think she thought i just went in had an injection then home. My family are lovely its just so stressful for them seeing me upset i try so hard to hold it in or cry alone. I definately think im even more emotional on tamoxifen. I never used to do dept either i used to sort all the bills when i was diagnosed the post scared me sounds ridiculous i know it just always seemed to be another letter from the hospital or some treatment changed etc so all letters went in draws for a while i didnt tell my partner. I just couldnt deal with anymore.i dont spend much i rarely leave the house now to be honest. Its my daughters birthday coming up and shes amazing she rarely asks for things as she knows we are having a hard time. I know she wants a lovely coat from top shop so im gonna make sure she gets it. Oh thankyou you made me cry i cant tell you what it means to me reading all this. I cant work i was made redundant didnt get much redundancy tho but never mind. Im having diep flap in january and a while to recover i hear. Im hoping it well help with this depression too. Can i ask have you always prefered to be alone or just since diagnosis? I dont seem to want to be around anyone either except family and a couple of close friends. You keep smiling to mr sox i love how you say that. I have a friend who had breast cancer a lovely lady. Every know and again i will text her keep smiling then i get a reply keep shining. We go through the whole song always makes me smile. So glad you are on this site you and london lass are always so supportive and give great advice. You are a star lovely lady thanks again. M. Xx",

I know it must be awful for you hubby away and not seeing the little one but you really are in the best place. Its a year and a half since i finished my chemo it was hard going but it will pass.

I would talk and talk about my diagnosis my fears side effects etc and I got the yes and no answers too. My sister who lives the other side of the world came to chemo appointments. After my op I went in for results alone as I new if it was really bad that I couldnt' be looking after him and his reaction. He was good in other ways and he was working 12 hours a day so I didnt' have too but it was a very hard time. Sometimes partners are the wrong people to talk too. They fear saying or doing the wrong thing. They really do want to help but don't know how. And yes sometimes they are in denial as talking about it makes it very real. I had a couple of friends to talk too and a clinical physcologist. When you have you're good weeks between chemo try to do something special a meal a day or night out together  and maybe just maybe for a few hours you will forget about cancer. Sometimes I envy the women who had amazing support from their partners but we are all different. I was diagnosed Oct 2015 it wont always be like this for you. Sending lots of love and hugs. You can do this. Xxx",

      "Content": "Hi everyone, I haven't been here for a while. Some of you may remember me. First of all I would like to thank all the incredible ladies here who's words of wisdom and kind caring messages got me through some very dark days. London lass, optimistic, snowys mum, seaspirit, joedec toxophilite to name a few. Apologies if I have missed anyone my memory isn't what it was. I often think of you all . My story to anyone struggling right now you need to here this. I was diagnosed October 2015. Double mastectomy 6 months chemo hospitalised after all bar one. Tissue expander and finally diep flap Feb 2017. My life has basically been on hold for the last 3 years. Friends have nearly all disappeared.  Apparently I should be over it. I lost my job soon after diagnosis. I've been to hell and back with treatment and various ops. I've suffered severe depression and my physcologist tells me I had a breakdown. All my relationships have suffered especialy with my partner of nearly ten years. He got depressed too. and lost his job so he struggled to cope. For nearly a year I sat on a beanbag in my living room with my curtains closed. I wasn't eating or sleeping and I was smoking terrible I know. I was told by an acquaintance how lucky I was that my partner didn't leave after my double mastectomy as her husband was a boob man. I was mocked for being overweight. 12 steroids a day every month for nearly a year can do that to a person. To them I was fat and lazy. I was constantly asked why arnt you back at work from people who have never worked might i add. Things were so bad i barely left the house in 2 years. My partner could not cope with me. He got more and more depressed and we were at breaking point. Then something happened I finally rang mcmillian again for a few days and they persuaded me to see my doctor. . She arranged for me to have more counselling weekly and antedepressents.  I was totally against these for a long time but as I couldn't string a sentence together without breaking down I had to take them. Within a couple of months I started to feel better and was finely able to deal with the aftermath of the whole cancer experience. I also did a kind of group therapy which was amazing.  Half way through the 8 weeks course I was offered a job by someone I briefly new. She is a home carer it's her company and they look after my father in law. It is not a career I have ever considered but I am a different person now because of this job. It is incredibly hard mentally as I do care so very much but it is so rewarding. Im still having some counselling every other week but I am now able to deal with everything that has happened to me. To all of you wonderful people know this when you are down there is only one way to go. Never ever give up because although your lives will never be the same , there is a new life out there for you . You will be braver and stronger than ever and live the life you deserve. I got through this and so can you. It's taken me nearly three years to get where I am today but I did it!!!!! Love to you all.

Sometimes the not knowing whats going to happen is worse. Lots of people will tell you to be positive and yes sometimes it helps but whenever things got to much for me i had a good cry. You will go through a rollercoaster of emotions but with the help of friends and family you will get through this. It will take some time to sink in for months i kept saying to myself i cant believe ive got cancer. .it was like it was happening to someone else. This group is amazing and we are all here for you so just take one day at a time, ask us anything there will always be someone around. In dec 2015 i had a double mastectomy 6 months chemo now on tamoxifen. I wont lie its not been easy but im still here. Its over 2 years for me. My sister had breast cancer 12 years ago too and shes doing fine. Sending lots of love and hugs. Xxx",

If she wants to read up recommend breast cancer care or mcmillian as they are the ones the hospital advise. A Google search quite often brings a worst case scenario so try to steer her away from that.  My advise would be just to listen and be there for her. Try to take her mind off things. Once she gets a treatment plan and knows what's  happening will help. The not knowing is hard. I would try and encourage her to join this site to talk to people with similar experiences. I didn't at first but wish I had earlier. Please be patient with her this will be absolutely terrifying. My diagnosis was Oct 2015. 3 tumours both breasts double mastectomy . 6 months chemo. It wont always be like this for her. Oh and my sister over 12 years since her diagnosis so there are some positives. Take care. ",

He did well one year you see well better than usual so he thought we might have to pay back some tax credits but this year he has barely earned anything. I think of would all even out. I get pip that's what's keeping us going well its buying food and running the car all other bills have been filed. We went to cab last year but universal credit a nightmare for the self employed. So we are stuck. We have nearly broke up so many times. I had surgery six weeks ago so I'm still recovering its my third surgery in two years and my mental health has suffered too. I don't do much I don't want much just some help for now. Thankyou for you're help I really appreciate it I just can't go on like this. Xx",

      "Content": "Hi all i had double mastectomy dec 2015 6 months chemo which i was hospitilised nearly every time. I couldnt have immediate reconstruction as i was a smoker. Ive been stopped 8 months now. In august i had tissue expander op to prepare for the big one as i call it. Things are quite tough for me at the moment. My partner is self employed and works come to a halt. My mum is in hospital and my partners family have so much going on too. His father had a stroke so he has carers 4 times a day which are expensive and intrusive.Ive never been the same since mastectomy and chemo i honestly dont recognise myself. Im really hoping this op will give me the confidence to start living again. I have shut myself away for a long time now. I have to go out today and im already worrying . Im going to visit my mum. I havent gone anywhere on my own for a long time now. I used to be a hard working happy go lucky girl . Ive had my fair share of bad luck over the years but somehow managed to bounce back. Im really struggling at the moment. All i want is peace in my life. Im scared of the op my surgeon keeps going over the risks but i think im more scared of not having it. I just cant go on like this. Any advice would be much appreciated. Love to all. M. Xx",

Im worried about everything to be honest. The op having complications eg blood transfusions will the flap fail. Will i wake up. The financial side too we are already struggling so worried how we are going to cope with my partner off to help me at first. Also putting my family through all of this again but its for my sanity. I see a clinical pyscologist it helps a bit. So encouraging to know that you have been there too. How did you get over that part? Thankyou its been very hard but i did it. My mum seemed much better today her neighbour came with me so it helped. Im hoping shes home on monday. Thanks again for taking the time to reply. It really means alot. Xx",

Please dont take any chances and as the nurse says call her back if things get any worse. Rest up today if you'e not feeling well until the kids are home at least. Chemo is hard going physicaly and emotionaly. Sometimes when we are alone with our thoughts things seem much worse. Do you have a favourite film on DVD or a  book? Easier said than done but sometimes can help take you're mind off things.  Take care thinking of you. Xx",

I have a friend who had a lumpectomy and she always says that ive had a harder time i honestly dont see it like that its still breast cancer still soul destroying. I often wonder if i had been able to have immediate reconstruction if it would have helped my mental state but maybe not. So sorry about you're brother. There is no one can hurt you like family. Tamoxifen has definately made my mood worse. I agree people seem embarressed but also some would say even my own mother never mind what you are ailing what about you're dad. He wasnt ill just running a busines on his own as i was to ill to work. Someone else said they had a cold and achy leg rhe times ive wanted to scream. I have let them go i wave say hello but thats all. Thankyou for you're kind words you sound like a lovely person. Xxx",

      "Content": "Hi to everyone im just wondering if anyone else feels like i do. Double mastectomy 2015 6 months chemo now tamoxifen. Couldnt do immediate reconstruction as i was a smoker. Ive had tissue expander op in august in preparation for diep flap in january. I honestly think i feel worse now than when i was diagnosed i just cant understand it. My friends have gradualy dwindled away as they seem to think im fine. I had to let some go as i got so angry when they told me they had a cold or a hangover or something else trivial. There were the ones who told me how lucky i was that my partner didnt leave me after mastectomy. Then the others who repeatedly told boob jokes. How can people be so cruel. Family have been no help really either. I have only recently joined this site and wondering if theres anyone else feeling the way i do. So sorry to moan i know i should consider myself lucky to have got through the ops and treatment im just struggling to move on. Financialy its been tough to i had no insurance and my partner is self employed and dosent always get paid on time. Some days i dont even open my curtains i never used to be this way. I just hope i feel better after my op my partner has been supportive but i worry about him to hes doing his best to support me and my 14 year old daughter but he is so stressed with work. I have only recetly joined this site so apologies if i do anything wrong.",

      "Content": "Hi lesley thankyou so much for you're reply. My beast friend of 44 years told me last year she woulsnt bother me again. She didnt it hurt a lot but she just didnt understand so i know what you mean. You sound like a very kind person taking you're brother on holliday. Do you think maybe hes struggling to help because of his wife maybe. Bless you i am so sorry you lost you're parents. You must have neen a great boss how lovely of her. I said the same to myself a cancer diagnosis and still smoked until a year after chemo. I finaly did it 17th feb this year one of the hardest things i have ever done. I actualy smoked more after diagnosis. Definitely not ridiculous i understand and would like to help you with that. A dear friend helped me sadly she is no longer here but she was an inspiration. Its an addiction its not as easy as saying im not going to smoke . Even a cancer diagnosis dosent stop the craving. Its about learning to cope without them. You cant just stop its been a part of you're life for such a long time. Ask me anything and i will help if i can. My surgeon wouldnt operate unless i stopped and i couldnt imagine looking like this forever so i had to. I know i should see my gp i ring mcmillian sometimes it helps. Thankyou again you have been a great help to me. You look after yourself too. Xxx",
