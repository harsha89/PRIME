      "Content": "Hi - thanks. It is reassuring to hear that you felt able to wear a swimming costume and go on holiday just four weeks after your surgery - well done to you and that makes me feel a bit more positive for my own op. Thanks for the hug and I do hope you are doing well with the rest of the treatment.",

      "Content": "I'm new here and a bit nervous. Just diagnosed with Grade 3 invasive ductal carcinoma - whatever that means. I am due to have a WLE on 13 May and am terrified but in the meantime I have developed a breast infection following my last biopsies. I now have a solid hard breast that is desperately painful and a stinging sensation in my chest. Really worried my op will be postponed but will just have to wait for antibiotics to work. I live alone so need to arrange for help after my op. Loads of well meaning people are telling me positive stories about people who got back to work in a matter of days. Is that true? How much help am I likely to need and how long might it take to recover from the first op. I just need to deal with that part first before worrying about the chemotherapy and radiotherapy I am supposed to be having later. Ooh that was a bit of a garble. But my mind is all over the place right now! I'd appreciate any advice from anyone who has been through it, also did anyone else get one of these infections?",
