      "Content": "Hi I use a soft toothbrush and Corsodyl toothpaste and mouthwash -  neither taste very good but you get used to the taste - don't mouthwash before eating as it makes food taste nasty! even worse if your tastebuds have been affected by the Chemo. The Corsodyl seemed to offer some protection as I only suffered fairly minor discomfort. The oncology nurses will provide a mouthwash if you ask",

      "Content": "Hi The under arm numbness lasts for some time I'm still experiencing this after 8 months although it has lessened, the sweat glands do not work anymore on the mastectomy side - a small bonus as deoderants last twice as long! I was advised to use Aqueous creams only (such as E45) until after chemo or other treatments were well and truly over as they have no hidden nasties that could irritate the skin. Hope you find this helpful. All the best for the future regards Tessa",

      "Content": "My hands started to peel even though I was using gloves and lots of moisturiser. My breast cancer nurse gave me one of the B vitamins to take (I can't remember whether it was b12 or b6) she also told me to use only E45 cream to moisturise as other moisturiser ingredients may contain extracts that will irritate the skin, watch your nails also as they might lift(as mine have) I've never had such horrible nails in all my life! but when treatment is over they will start to grow again along with your hair, eyebrows and eyelashes.Might be worthwearing cotton gloves for a while too - just a thought good luck tessatoss",

      "Content": "I wasn't made aware that there could be a problem with my nails after chemo, but had noticed that my finger ends hurt when pressed, not all of them all of the time, I think my thumbs started first -  just after  the first Tax treatment.  I didn't like to mention this to anyone as I thought they might think I was imagining it!However my nails didn't start to lift until after the second treatment they are all affected,  I was advised to wear rubber gloves, use Teatree oil between the nail and nailbed and keep the nails very short. I find it very frustrating as you have to be nail aware all of the time! I have always worn nail varnish of various hues (during treatment also) so can say the nail varnish theory didn't work for me. I still wear nail varnish to try and protect the nails. None have fallen off yet! I moisturise my hands frequently and pay particular attention to the cuticles. I have had bother with numbness in my big toes one peeled and the other one is still a bit edgy - this is mad isn't it? any way I also massage my feet on a regular basis too. I'm a great believer in moisturising the skin but the lengths I've gone to over the last months is ridiculous !!! Of course you must moisturise the inside too and drink as much as you can a bit difficult if your appetite has gone and everything tastes like sawdust! Look after yourself regards Tessatoss  ",

      "Content": "HI I have finished my treatment now, but remember well the tastebuds going every thing tasted yuck , I found I could only eat  tinned vegetable soup (tomato based) or tomato soup with some piri piri sauce splodged in it, Yoghurts weren't too bad or the odd glass of full cream milk! I found that my taste buds were just reaching some normality just before the next session of chemo so off we went again - ginger bisciuts, ginger tea, fizzy water also helped a little - keep on with the pickled onion crisps if necessary at least you are tasting something! The taste buds recover fairly quickly when chemo stops. Look after your nails - toe nails as well and moisturise everything!    My last chemo was in March - my finger ends hurt and my big toes were a bit numb, one worse than the other it's very strange isn't it?  my finger nails lifted ( I treated them with Tea tree oil to stop infection and wore gloves for washing up etc. but are now growing normally though ridged, my toenails are coming off now- I didn't think they were affected - fortunately the new nail has grown underneath Hope this helps a little keep your chin up! regards Tessatoss ",
