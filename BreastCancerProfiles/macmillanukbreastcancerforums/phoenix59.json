      "Content": "Hey SophieK Same here .a pain isn\u2019t it?!... I also got very low on them ..almost immediately after taking them.. & found side effects huge .. then again my relationship with pharmaceutical drugs is not a good one!...but not everyone is the same ..as my younger friend takes Tamoxifen & is ok .. although she does take antidepressants along side them? .. they stopped her eye waterfalls! ..so maybe worth asking oncologist/gp if it doesn\u2019t get any better hun.. Good luck Sophie hope it gets easier for you ..take care xx",

      "Content": "Hi florence2017  Me too.. early 2016 was prescribed anatrozole.. speech & balance problems after 2 days! Told to come off them after 2 weeks.. then tried tamoxifen= low mood, fog, anxiety for 9 months.. then came the latrozole.. with it came chronic bone pain.. totally on a different planet ! with fog .memory.time keeping.seemed to have no control over Life in general was hard work.. as the benefit of the meds for me was low .. I decided to come off them (not quite sure how I feel about it yet  atm ) but after a week felt fog lifting & bone pain lots better.. I too was bubbly dizzy & smiley ..  made as the 'old' me!..just thought I'd let you know I had the same problem with the meds.. hope you find an answer hun.. take care & good luck ☘️",
