    "Content": "My 43 year old sister was yesterday diagnosed with Invasive Lobular Carcinoma Grade 1.  She has an MRI scan tomorrow and results next week which I will go with her for.  Would it be fair to think that a grade 1 means that it is unlikely to have spread, the whole family is in shock and I'm desperately trying to arm myself with as much info as possible before the results meeting.  She was told best case scenario would be surgery and radiotherapy but if it has spread is it possible to have surgery to remove from lots of sites?",
