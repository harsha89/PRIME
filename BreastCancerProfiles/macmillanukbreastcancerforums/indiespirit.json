    "Content": "Dear Chloecat, I have just found your message as above and would love to know what happened in your treatment plan and to you, after this last message of November 2013? I completely relate to your stance and really hope you conquered the C in your own way and that it all worked out... I am a new member of this and have just posted my own message similar to yours - as in finding less non invasive ways than mastectomy - under my username indiespirit. I really hope you see this and that you may reply. All best wishesÂ ",
