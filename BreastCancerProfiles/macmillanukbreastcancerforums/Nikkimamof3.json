Although mine is a cervical cancer.. It still gives me hope as I am a big fan and the words are very endearing and mean alot.. Cheesy I guess but that's me!! Love and hope to all xxxx",

      "Content": "Hi Ali,, hope you are feeling ok considering.. I too like everyone on here know how you are feeling.. I am newly diagnosed and it feel's like I am in my own little world.. It does get easier to deal with though.. It has been 4 week's for me.. Starting my combined treatment next week.. You get sick of hearing be positive and saying to people \"I am being positive\",, but it is the way forward.. I can honestly say you have to look around at what you have in your life and really focus on it.. My children and my family are my world and I take great comfort in them.. You will be well looked after and it is scary but as I have learnt joining here, there are so many of us and you are not alone. I am writing this while waiting to have one of many scans at hospital.. I don't know about you but I find this the most tiring thing.. Test after test.. Backward and forward to hospital.. We are very lucky though that we get amazing treatment in this country..everyone where I am is amazing.. I am having a coffee morning to raise some money.. Why don't you order a pack from this website..get some friend's round and eat cake and have a girly giggle.. It will raise your spirit's and raise some money too.. Chin up and keep us posted how you are..lol",

      "Content": "Awe this is amazing.. What a lovely positive message we are all sending to each other.. 1 my three beautiful girl's.. One a new baby who I carried whilst having cancer and is the most well behaved and beautiful baby ever.. Two year old who keeps me fit( although not as fit as I used to be) and the teenager who is just that!! A teenager! Love them all.. 2 my amazing Big Sis who as liver disease and battle's everyday with chronic fatigue, but has been a tower of strength to me and my lot. 3 my parent's who are struggling to come to term's with my cancer but are helping with the children and being such a rock.. I love them so much as all my family. 4 pizza.. I know weird but even a chemo hangover won't stop me wanting my treat of takeaway pizza express.. Mmmmm. 5 knowing I am lucky to have a fighting chance and never taking my health or my life for granted ever again. And deciding I want to help, so when I am well I want to look into how I can get involved supporting other's.. A new meaning to life! 6watching Midsummer Murder re-runs in my pj's and not feeling guilty I haven't hoovered today! Hey I am fighting the spaceinvader's the housework can wait. 7 my friends,, each one different but all capable of making me giggle..and supporting each other through all our lives 8 last but not least my lovely fianc√©.. He is trying so hard to say and do all the right thing's and sometimes I push him away.. But he is my soulmate and I know I can rely on him.. He is an amazing Dad and is learning with me everyday how this evil disease work's and we can't wait to get married next year.. Even when I just want to scream and shout and we both feel angry we ge through it and tomorrow is another day.. Tag team! That's all I need. I hope everyone can find something to give them hope and positive thought's.. That is why it so nice to come on here.. You are never alone.. Love to all xxxx Nikki",
