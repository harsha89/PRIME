      "Content": "Clairebemoo  that is enormously helpful advice ! thanks so much as i think my friend who's a single mum (two kids 10 and 5) could certainly do with after school care (school runs are going to get very difficult) and her sister (who lives with us and earns precious little) is not in a position to rush to live with her to rescue the situation! I think the single mum assumes she has to keep working in a badly paid job (i think this will be a no go when chemo kicks in). i might try the school if they are supportive - one hopes they will have picked up what is going on?? and will fight her corner with us..",

      "Content": "Dear All - first confession : I'm not a mum with young kids, but we're trying to help work out a support plan for a single mum with two small kids. The mum's sister lives with us, and is in a bit of a panic - ready to drop everything and rush in to offer help in another part of the UK (and give up a rather precarious income as a result). We're trying to find out a picture of how things are (the cancer sufferer 'A' has lumps in both breasts, going for first cycle of chemo soon). So I'm interested to know what kind of support is around for single mum's with cancer during chemo. The kids are both young but not baby/toddler age-wise. I'm trying to get hold of the breast cancer specialist nurse for a bit of input, but it's helpful to know people's experiences.",
