      "Content": "Hi All, I joined the community a week ago and I have read many blogs and posts.  Firstly I would like to acknowledge how inspirational you all are, many of you barely get to finish one battle before another begins. I have now personally reached a stage (12 days and counting until right MX with expander implant) that I can label my feelings.  Angry, Scared,  Stressed, Devastated and I don't like myself much either at the moment. Information goes round and round in my head all the time, how will we pay the mortgage? what will it look like after? how am I going to feel? what if my results show further treatment is needed after my MX? How can I continue to protect my Daughters from seeing me fall apart? (they are 12 and 9) My work would like me to return after 3-4 weeks, as I am Deputy Manager and my Manager goes on maternity leave in April with the expectation I will step into her shoes full time.  I only get 3 days full pay then statutory sick pay.  How does anyone cope financially on SSP? I really struggle to talk to friends and family as I seem to be considered 'one of the lucky ones' and I am not one to join face to face groups.  I do have a very loving and supportive husband that listens to me ranting! I just don't know how to move forward or prepare myself. Thank you all for taking the time to listen. xxx Tania",

      "Content": "Hi Jacky, Thank you for your insight, it sounds so similar to how I feel!  I will be having a few lymph nodes removed to make sure they are clear.  My surgeon has told me it's less than 5% chance that they may be infected, fingers crossed, waiting for that result must be hell.  My MRI showed a 5cm area of DCIS.  I have since done my best to avoid going out in case I run into someone who knows! How long have you been off work recovering? Has it been the emotional healing rather than the physical healing that takes the longest? My work hope I will be back after 3 weeks. Thank you again. Xxx",

      "Content": "Hi Kay, I know exactly what you mean.  I was diagnosed with high grade DCIS two weeks ago, I am still in shock and everything is moving so fast now.  I am having a mastectomy in less than three weeks with expander implant.  It keeps being referred to as pre-cancer, which everyone tells me I am so lucky for, so why am I losing a breast?  I am still burying my head in the sand.  I need to be strong for my children.  I just don't know where to begin. Let me know how your getting on.  Tania. X",
