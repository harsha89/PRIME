    "Content": "Hello BeautyBeau15 i had hair down to my bum, just before i started chemo i had it cut up to shoulder length. Day 15 after the first round of chemo it started to come out i let it go for three more days and rang my friend she came and used the clippers. I didnt fancy a wig i have got lots of nice bandanas and some hats. I made it my choice as it was going to happen anyway and i havnt regretted my decision. Good luck on your journey",
