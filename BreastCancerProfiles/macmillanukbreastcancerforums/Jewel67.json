      "Content": "Hi Starway, I have been on Anastrozole for almost two years following WLE and radiotherapy and also Alendronic acid tablets once a week as my first bone scan showed osteopenia. According to the NHS Predict tool the Anastrozole gives me 1% improvement over five years, which is not very much. Anyway interestingly at my first year check I saw a locum at the hospital, an older and obviously very experienced lady doctor who told me that they know the first two years of hormone therapy are the most important. I have tried to check this but cannot find any reference to this fact anywhere. So I decided to take them for two years, or probably until the next bone scan in the new year, and then probably stop but I\u2019m going to talk about this at my two year check up this month. I think everybody has to consider quality of life on any medication and for me a 1% improvement due to Anastrozole does not justify swallowing pills which, although they haven\u2019t caused me major side effects, are gradually affecting me in many ways (skin, hair, joints etc). Obviously if hormone therapy gives a higher percentage improvement in the chance of the cancer not returning then it is a harder decision to make and apart from that it is only a prediction not a guarantee. All the best with whatever you decide. Julia",

      "Content": "I had a very similar diagnosis of a lobular invasive carcinoma except slightly bigger 2cm, had lumpectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy, fortunately no lymph nodes affected, followed two months later by 15 days of radiotherapy and now hormone treatment (anti oestrogen) for 5 maybe 10 years. The RT was no big deal except for the travelling every week day to the hospital and hanging about waiting and in three months from diagnosis I was done with the hospital treatment, now just the pills and bone strengthening pills as well since my bone density scan was not the best and the anti-oestrogens can make that worse.  I have not even had side effects from the Anastrozole or Alendronic Acid.  Compared to many I know I am really really lucky. So what I am saying is think as positive as you can, I know the waiting is awful but it sounds as though it has been found early and it doesn't have to be the worst scenario your imagination can drum up. It is unlikely your doctor knew anything he was probably just trying to prepare you and if he's rude and abrupt the next time as well then tell him he is and you don't appreciate it. Some of these doctors live in their own little bubble and it needs bursting! Good luck and all the best for Thursday",

      "Content": "Hi Annie, I've been on Anastrozole for twelve months and have continued to have permanent tint on my hair the whole time about every five weeks at the hairdresser. I didn't have it during radiotherapy (no chemo) but after that just carried on as normal. My hair hasn't shown any signs of thinning and my hairdresser commented last week what good condition it's in. I think if I noticed any changes I would try a natural hair dye like the ones they sell in Holland & Barrett. To try and compensate I only use shampoos and conditioners made from natural ingredients without parabens and as few chemicals as possible, which hopefully makes a difference. There are lots on the market and worth the higher cost for me, Boots have a range called Kind Natured which isn't pricey and is quite often on offer. Hope this is helpful, Julia",

Apparently it reduced menopausal flushing by 73% in trials. Maybe finally we will eventually have something which really works",

I've been on generic Anastrozole for four months and have had no side effects except some tinnitus which seems to have eased off now, not sure if it was related although I've seen others mention it too. The information leaflet scared me to death but so far so good. Good luck!",

      "Content": "Hi Laura, I was diagnosed with stage 2 lobular BC almost 18 months ago, had a lumpectomy and sentinel node biopsy (at the same time), no lymph node involvement so I only had three weeks or 15 days of radiotherapy about two months later, which apart from the Mon-Friday every day trip to the hospital and the hanging about was for me no big deal. The operation was just day surgery and they give you exercises to do afterwards, I had no major issues with that either. It must depend on which part of the breast they operate on to some extent I think although the breast is not hugely sensitive. If your mum's tumour is oestrogen positive she will have anti-hormone tablets (aromatose inhibitors for post menopausal women) for at least 5 years, the recommendation has recently been increased to ten years, they do have some side effects like joint pains and hot flushes but these seem to vary hugely from one person to another and you can switch to different ones if you have bad side effects. Some people hardly have any. Yes her stage could change as it's hard for them to be certain how big the area affected is until they take it out. If they operate at least a week before the holiday she should be fine but if that's not possible honestly three weeks isn't likely to make a huge difference. Generally cancers don't grow that fast and stage 1 is good. They will know more when the MRI results are in. Hope this helps and you all have a great holiday. Julia",
