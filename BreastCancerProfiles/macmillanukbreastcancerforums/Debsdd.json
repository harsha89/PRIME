Did You take anything for the loo issues ? Did you take time off work ? I\u2019m planning getting rid of my hair before the first cycle and hoping it comes back better than it is now ! How are you now ?  Xx",

      "Content": "Thanks Carolyn .. my boss is sympathetic but he seems to think I\u2019ll breeze thru it and come in but I will mention the chemo fog as I have read about that and I need to be able to multitask at work and if that\u2019s not possible it will be a real problem ... will have to see how day two goes ! I had the codine phosphate after surgery and it made me itch like mad! I\u2019m planning on shaving my hair before I start as I don\u2019t think I can handle afterwards on top of feeling crap ..hubs has agreed to do it for me he doesn\u2019t talk about it much not sure if it\u2019s a bit of denial of that he doesn\u2019t want to upset me.. I\u2019ll have to get some lollies in! Xx",
