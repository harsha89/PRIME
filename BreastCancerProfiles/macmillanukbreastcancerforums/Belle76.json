I told my partner although it felt better to tell someone it didn't change any of the emotions. It's now over 2 months an I can tell u it's been mostly downs but believe it or not there's lots of good days, which I honestly felt I wouldnt have again.

      "Content": "Hello everyone,                             My name is Shelley (35) I was recently diagnosed with breast cancer which as most of you will know is soul destroying at first, All sorts of terrible thoughts go through ur mind. After the initial shock i started to feel ok after about 8 days i thoughtto myself it is what it is i refuse to let this awful situation get the better of me!! But after appointment yesterday to get results of breast MRI feel really let down if im honest :-(  Was told they referred me 3 wks ago to another hospital for genetics as i have quite a few family members from both sides, That have had breast cancer including both my Grandmothers. But unfortunately heard nothing back an will chase it up when they get a chance!! To say i was taken back  a little by their response to this is putting it mildly!! At my first diagnosis i was advised to have removal of my left breast but yesterday said maybe to have lumpectomy an lymphnode removal. Then possibly a mastectomy depending on genetics an results of lymphnodes. Feeling so confused at moment as i'd already excepted the fact that my left breast was gone!! Whatever it takes to get over this right?!! Then was told by Dr an nurse hopefully surgery was going to be within 2-3 wks, After going into sit an recap with bc nurse asked weather she was going to sort out surgery date today? She went on to say unfortunately the lady that deals with making appointments was on training thursday a friday an is'nt in on monday either!! My mum who was with expressed who dissapointment about what she had heard in the last 30 mins, reluctantly leaving, feeling positive it was'nt present in my right breast but like they was'nt looking after me the way they should be!! (Am i over reacting??)   Am now contemplating being refferred to cancer specialist hospital which is further away but that is'nt an issue. Have had another set back today as they fully booked for my surgery till the 28th Aug.  So nearly 6 wks rather than the hopeful 2-3, My Nan also cant understand why my lymphnodes not been checked in any way yet although this was mentioned when i was having my biopsy a month ago!! Sorry to go on i know this is a long rant just feel really insecure about my future if im honest. Many thanks Shelley  x x x",
