      "Content": "Hi Binny So sorry to hear that you are having such a tough time of it. Wish we had a magic wand to take all your worries away Yes - Tamoxifen can cause visual problems. The current patient information leaflet lists optic nerve diseases, which cause problems with your sight.  The incidence is less than 1/100 and more than 1/1000 people. I am about to be switched onto Tamoxifen (have had one hell of a time with aromatase inhibitors) so am off to see my optician for a thorough eye check before I start.  I'm diabetic so the risk is probably higher than normal for me. ... with my day job hat on...Anyone reading this - always read any medicines leaflet that you get and report any side effects that you notice immediately to your oncology team (and then your GP).  You can also report side effects directly to the UK regulatory agency (MHRA) - even if they are on the leaflet. This helps them work out the likely incidence rate in different diseases - important with cancer. The link is at:  http://www.mhra.gov.uk/Safetyinformation/Howwemonitorthesafetyofproducts/Medicines/TheYellowCardScheme/Informationforpatients/index.htm You fill in a form and you can decide whether or not you want them to tell your doctor that you have reported this.  I have done this for arimidex and for letrozole. Binny - fingers crossed for you. Big hug xoxo",

      "Content": "Hi Denise OK - with my medical hat on:  Anastrozole and Arimidex are one and the same thing.  Arimidex is the a tablet containing the drug anastrozole with a mixture of inert ingredients.  The generic versions, which are significantly cheaper, contain EXACTLY the same drug, but may contain different inactive ingredients.  This is why the NHS policy is to prescribe generic versions. When  new generic versions are developed, the companies that develop them are obliged by law to perform a study to show that the way in which the drug is absorbed from the generic tablet is the SAME as the innovator.  So all generic forms of Arimidex, which are supplied as Anastrozole tablets, provide drug that is absorbed from the gut in the SAME WAY as arimidex.  That said, some people find that the INACTIVE ingredients lead to differences in some side effects, but not the major ones of arthritis etc. I started off on anastrozole (arimidex) and tolerated it for about 3 months - it was a bastard as regards side effects - absolutely awful. So then we tried another related aromatase inhibitor called letrozole - this was a lot better, but still gave me awful arthritic symptoms. The aromatase inhibitors have a very long half-life (takes 2-4 days for one dose to clear to half the maximum dose.. and I am currently off ALL therapy for 2-3 weeks to clear my body of the drug.  Then I am going to be taking tamoxifen.  Why?  because once again the side-effects of letrozole have been unacceptable. Go and see your oncology team.. there are other options for therapy that may be better suited to you.  The clinical practice guidelines tell doctors what they should give to patients, based on the AVERAGE responses that have been noted.  Unfortunately everyone is DIFFERENT, so average may not suit you - as clearly it doesn't.  Ask them to treat you with something else. Take care and hope this helps",

      "Content": "Hi everyone I didn't bother with the cold cap.  I knew that my hair grows pretty fast and would come back afterwards..  Losing your hair is a good indicator that the chemo is working.  I got a really good wig for not too much money (some people didn't realise that I had lost all my hair) and I went looking for some lovely whacky hats and turbans - search for suburban turban on the web - they have some nice ones.  The thing I hadn't thought about was getting a cold head at night - but once I had bought a couple of lovely soft sleeping caps (from said suburban turban...)  I was all fixed. My hair started growing back about 12 weeks after the chemo had ended (about 6 weeks after RT) and came in grey and wavey... I have ALWAYS wanted wavey hair so this was a lovely revelation! But I can't cope with grey, so my colour now comes out of a bottle and I am having fun experimenting with different shades..! Re: 50 shades of grey... I haven't read the book, but my brother sent me a HILARIOUS spoof called 50 SHEDS of Grey which had me howling with laughter all through my chemo... I can highly recommend it for those with a slightly silly sense of humour..! Good luck everyone",

We are here for you.  We all understand how you feel.  Goodness knows we have all been down and had our dark days, and we know your worries, but we all support you.  You are not dealing with this on your own.  Big hugs and positive thoughts coming your way. xx",

      "Content": "Hello Sue First of all, the human body is remarkably resilient.  Everyone who has cancer or who has had cancer has resilience, and you have it too.  Crying is good - it releases pent up anxiety, so don't feel that your crying is a bad thing.   Taking in a diagnosis of cancer is not easy.. we have all had the sleepless nights whilst waiting for the final diagnosis - the enormity of what may be ahead goes round and around your head. Whatever the future holds - and any cancer treatment is individual to you, your medical support team will be doing everything possible to support you on your journey. Being diagnosed with cancer is a heart-stopping moment;  everyone around you goes \"OMG\" and doesn't know how to help you.  My colleagues all asked me how they can help and I said \"humour\", so we laughed and joked our way through two rounds of surgery, chemo and radiotherapy.  None of the treatments need be scarey if you ask for advice and understand what is going on.Concentrate on getting information - from Macmillan and from your care team - ask lots and lots of questions - what is this for, why do I need this, how will this help me..  ? Having information is the key to not being scared and understanding that your chances of survival are very good is something positive to concentrate on.  You will get through this.  We can all help you with that.  Best options, from my experience - information, hugs, delegating jobs to friends and sharing your anxiety with friends and family.  They will enfold you in an enormous shield of love.",

      "Content": "Dear Shaz....Goodness, the first thing to know is that you are in the scariest place at the moment - things will start to look a lot better once you have a treatment plan.  I had chronic insomnia whilst I was waiting.. all these \"what if\" and \"how\" and \"why me?\" questions go around and around in your head.  Best thing to do is to share your thoughts with a good friend or two.  I did that and they gave me an emotional space where I could express my deepest fear and get support away from my family - who were all reeling.  I soon found that I had group of people who, although they were some distance away, put their kindness and warmth around me like a huge cuddle.  It certainly helped. And everyone here can help you with that too... The hormone results take a little while because they sometimes have to grow up the biopsy to get a good idea of it's status.  If you don't hear soon enough ask your GP to help. Try and chill out over Easter - the calmer you are, the easier it will be to boldly go where you need to!  Very best of luck, H xx   ",
