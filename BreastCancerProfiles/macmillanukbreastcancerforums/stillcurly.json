    "Content": "Hi  i have just joined the forum.....i was diagnosed almost two years ago with lobular breast cancer. Had a mastectomy, chemo and radiotherapy. Because I was post menopausal I was prescribed letrozole and because it's also apparently more effective on lobular BC. I've been on it for 14 months now, the accord brand which I had read more positive reviews about that others so I requested it. Se's aren't too bad at all. Hair has grown back in curly again, but definitely thinner and I think is thinning a bit more at the front in recent months. Bit concerned about that. I'm on the letrozole for 10 years as my oncologist said that hormone therapy has more positive results with lobular BC and that 10 years is more of a safeguard from it returning than only taking it for 5. If it keeps the cancer away then se's are worth it but the hair is a concern.... So hoping it doesn't get any worse.  Thank u ladies for the various suggestions posted. I will look into them. ",
