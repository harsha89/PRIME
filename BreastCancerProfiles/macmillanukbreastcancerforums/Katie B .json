      "Content": "Well not so good news, the crazy headaches and sickness I had did turn into my worst case scenario. Pushed for a CT scan and has shown brain mets. Panic, scared, worried and anxious just not enough descriptive words to cover this. Thankfully full body CT shows no nasties lurking anywhere else. I have an MRI today to plan treatment. Ironically I have been suffering with the most horrendous head cold so cannot tell how much is down to cold or brain!!!....... Just as always searching for any experiences, positive stories or general what to expect. Incredibly sad about the whole thing but I really am pushing myself to eekkkkk out the best that I can from the situation. Much love to all, Katie",

      "Content": "Hi, My hair started to fall out in the third week after my first EC. As soon as it was coming out quite a lot I got my sister to clipper it off to a number 1. I never went for the cold cap and also didn't get a wig. I just got cotton caps, In varying colours to coordinate with outfits!! The stubby hair that was left actually took a while to fall out and I would say I was only completely (shiny!!!) bald for about 3 weeks as mine started to grow back after my first of three Docetaxel. In all honesty I kind of embraced the no hair and found it quite liberating!!! I did however struggle when I lost my eyelashes during tax (they stuck around during EC) but I have now mastered the art of false lashes and I did a Look Good Feel Better group for make up tricks. Hope some of this helps xx Katie.",

      "Content": "Hi Joedec, I like you do feel I look awful without mascara!!... I only apply false lashes to the top and with a little clever eyeliner along the lash line on the bottom and a touch of white eyeliner on the bottom waterline it kind of gives the illusion of lashes! I work with Beauty Therapy tutors and when I applied my lashes and showed them they thought I had them professionally done!! (I used eyelure no.20). I don't wear them all the time and with eyeliner along the top lash line, again it gives a good definition and gives the illusion of lashes when I'm not wearing the falsies!! Xx The white eyeliner also helps with brightening up tired and watery eyes!!  Katie xxx ",
