      "Content": "Mom23 I know how you feel - I didn\u2019t want to tell anyone until I had a definite result but have caved in now and told my sisters - it was getting too hard trying to avoid them and they knew something was going on. Could you maybe tell your sister a half truth and say you\u2019re not feeling too well and just blame the many bugs going round and you\u2019ll let her know towards the end of next week? Hope you sort something out x",

      "Content": "Oh my goodness I feel like I\u2019ve just been reading my own story except I\u2019m one step further on. I had a routine mammogram and got a letter a week later recalling me for further tests. I too am on HRT. My mum also had breast cancer when she was 3 years older than I am now but thankfully recovered and passed away a few years ago at 84 from bowel cancer. Had my appointment at Breast clinic last Tuesday and was told they could see a \u201cdense mass\u201d in my left breast. This was followed by a scan and biopsy on the lump. I am back for the results on Wednesday morning and have been to hell and back during the past week. Have managed to stay off google but remember vividly my mum going through it all - and yes I know things have moved on in the last 30 years. I am desperate for Wednesday to arrive but absolutely dreading it too. Not told anyone in the family apart from the hubby - luckily my two lovely daughters are both away at uni but I can\u2019t even begin to image how to tell them if the results are not good on wed. I have 4 sisters and have held off telling them too until after I know what I\u2019m dealing with on Wednesday.  So glad I\u2019ve found this lovely forum and reading all the helpful advice has made a huge difference. Good luck mom23 and I hope you get a good outcome when you get to the clinic.",

      "Content": "Hi ladies - bit of a mixed emotions day. Back at the hospital for biopsy results but these were inconclusive so had to have another set of 6 biopsies done using the mammogram machine.  The good news is the lump is very small which they think is why the first biopsies which were done using ultrasound didn\u2019t hit the right area.  Got to wait another 2 weeks for results now but feel a bit more positive that even if it is a tumour, it\u2019s so small and hasn\u2019t spread they might just be able to remove it.  Still 2 more weeks of waiting to get through though first.  I\u2019ve told my 2 daughters now and they have been great so one less thing to worry about.  ",
