    "Content": "I was diagnosed last October for the second time with breast cancer. This time i new something was wrong. I had a mastectomy lasts November and had reconstruction at the same time. I'm currently under going chemotherapy. I have good days and  some very dark days as my reconstrcted breast looks nothing like a breast it just looks and feels rock hard, my sister said it looked like a stone had been attached to my chest. I find i can not look at myself in the mirror, in the bath or when i get dressed and undressed as it upsets me so much.",
