      "Content": "Hi Mags we are both nurse practitioners in our house ( although I now lecture in uni) and would recommend ringing your unit today or perhaps even better your GP practice tomorrow and getting it check by the practice nurse or district nurse, if it is tracking downwards you can develop a sinus or infection quite quickly which will delay treatment.  JJ is right mag sulphate can be useful but usually on blind spots, boils etc and we do not tend to use them on surgical wounds, the stitch will loosen eventually but need to keep the trauma and risk of infection down to a minimum while it does. Hope it settles soon x",
