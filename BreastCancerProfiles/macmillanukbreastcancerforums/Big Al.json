    "Content": "Hi Everyone, Had my first dose of Docetaxel yesterday, feel fine today, which is good as for my first week after having FEC i felt so ill. I read that the majority of people have pain whilst having Docetaxel, can anyone tell me what kind of pain please - is like flu pain or worse than that?? And also did most people having the Docetaxel experience hairloss - i've lost all my hair but between chemos it starts to grow back - was wondering if it comes out with Docetaxel too? Sorry if this all seems a bit vague - i'm new to forums and things lie that. Any help/advice etc would be greatful received. Thanks. Love Alison x",
