      "Content": "Started with the one stop breast clinic X-ray show up cluster of calcifications they said where suspicious and could be cancerous had core biopsy. Week later results inconclusive needed vacuum biopsy ten days later went for that wait for the results. I\u2019ve been all over they place good on minute then crying the next decided after two weeks of waiting to ring the clinic spoke to breast care nurse who said they have to have MDT meeting about results if it had been nothing they would send later out but they won\u2019t me to come in for a meeting and will ring me (mind went into overdrive again). It\u2019s know been nearly three weeks had phone call this morning got to going in on Wednesday morning for results.  I asked who I would be see they said the breast cancer nurse is this normal at first (thought it would have been a consultant).  Just want to know what I\u2019m facing the waiting for 6weeks has been unbearable.  ",

      "Content": "Thanks very much for your reply I\u2019ve only got two more days to go and yes as you said the not knowing feels  dreadful.  Guess it take so long as I have had two biopsies each time waiting for appointments for them but this time three weeks for the results of the vacuum has seemed to go on for ever.  Once I know what\u2019s happening I sure it will get easier.  Thanks again for replying hope your keeping well",
