      "Content": "Hi Snowys Mum I have my tattoos and start treatment 28/12 and it is as you say 14 over 3 weeks. It's good to hear of your relatively good experience with radiotherapy. It makes me feel a bit better about it all. Kate, the Macmillan Radiotherapy Expert, reassured me that having radiotherapy was the right thing to do after a lumpectomy.  I think it will help to lesson the worry about recurrence which we may have. As I had left breast cancer I have to do this 20sec deep breath holding to keep the heart out of the way. Practising with my head in a bowl of water daily. It's certainly helping and I'm getting better at it. Wishing you all a lovely Christmas and New Year. Syl",

I was just saying that the time between appointments is very long but they do understand pain and try all sorts of things. I was prescribed some sticky patches that I put on the area of pain. They remained on for 12hrs every night. They also take time to work. They may help you but didn't do much for me.  Keep going.  We are all rooting for you. Syl",

London Lass you are going to feel quite a lot better with the new pills if it is amitryptaline which in small doses it works very well for neuropathic pain. It can work quite quickly.  Changing the subject back to R1and R2 creams for radiotherapy. I have asked the pharmacist at the GP's surgery but she can't find it on the system. I have written down the code for prescribing but forgot to write down who it was manufactured by so as to go to my local pharmacy. Thanks .Syl",

The GP was very understanding and listened finally putting me on Pregabalin, which is the same as Gabapentin I think. It doesn't work straight away but makes you feel sleepy. In fact it took weeks to have the desired effect and is working well now. At the Pain Clinic they have just tested the nerves on that side. I am waiting for the results of that but don't have an appointment until the beginning of January. Unreal. I suppose they are very busy. There is always a long time between appointments at the ",

      "Content": "I have just finish treatment for breast cancer HR2 pos and had 4 intravenous chemo with the herceptin and continued on to complete a course of 18 herceptin. The last shot was two weeks ago and I have been very sleepy since then most of the time. I put it down to being old 77yrs and coping with long term  type one diabetes. On top of which I have a pesky head cold. Ja, the drippy nose has been with me for a long time but didn't connect it with the herceptin. So that will will be nice when it goes. My toe nails started to become a problem some time ago and look ghastly. The podiatrist trimmed them as best she could and reassured me that they would come through good again. The finger nails have also been affected and they are flaky and break easily thus I am almost down to the quicks. A small price to pay when you think about what other people go through. Glad that the cancer was diagnosed and dealt with quickly and and efficiently. I consider myself very fortunate.",

Usually it's in the middle of the night after a particularly nasty episode of cramp in both thighs or both calves and I have to walk around for quite a while until the cramp goes. I am trying magnesium tabs and orange juice daily as suggested. I can go for several days without any cramp at all but I think I have always had a bit of a problem before the cancer only now it is much much worse and lasts for longer. That's why I thought it may have something to do with the herceptin. Syl",
