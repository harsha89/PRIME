      "Content": "My mum is currently taking Tamoxifen to prevent re-ocurrence of her breast cancer and seems to think there is a new drug that is better than Tamoxifen.  I can't seem to find anything on the net other than Arimidex which she has taken in the past. She has also had Exemestane and Lectrozole but none of these have worked.  The last time the cancer returned last year she was put back on Tamoxifen but is experiencing side effects - sweats, weight gain, bleeding (this is being investigated). Does anyone know of any new drugs? I am new to this so please forgive me if I have gone on too much!",
