It's such a big shook to be told you have breast cancer please just deal with one thing at a time stay off Google that's what the nurse told me she said Google is only good for making a Victoria sandwich.  If you need something to help you sleep go and speak to your doctor yours is a very early stage . Mine is stage 2 we are strong as woman keep your inner strength going xx",
