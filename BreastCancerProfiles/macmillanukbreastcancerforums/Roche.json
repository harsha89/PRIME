      "Content": "I first had breast cancer in 2011.i had a lumpectomy, 6 sessions of chemo and 25 sessions of radiotherapy and was put onto tamoxifen. I thought that was it - how wrong was I. 4 weeks ago I was diagnosed with breast cancer in the other breast doc said only 7% chance of getting it so I now count myself as unlucky. Only good thing it was caught very early and not in the nodes. I had a lumpectomy 3 weeks ago, very sore  under my arm ,still exhausted all the time and very weapy, I also struggle to sleep at night. I start Radiotherapy ( 20 sessions) in Aug as I have to go back to South Africa and put up the memorial stone for my mom who passed away in August 2017. What a year I have had.  Any  tips on coping with Radiotherapy, feeling tired and down.  I work in a school so gong back on Monday till end of term however I am not sure I am ready. I really don\u2019t know if I have fituge or is is it\u2019s the effects from the operation. Have I not given myself enough time to heal, if not how long does it take to heal.  Any advice and help appreciate ",
