      "Content": "Hi dreamthief, yes your right achalasia is a prob with stomach and oesophagus, don't get too much trouble with it but it is rare. I have one kidney due to an rtc as a 10 year old child. They did the predict tool. worst case scenario with just surgery and hormone treatment is ithink 73% at 5 years and 52% at 10 years. I am not the type of person that tolerates being ill don't drink as I don't like the swimmy feel it gives !!! never smoked had a lot of traumatic memories of hospital in the 70 s . so leaning towards no chemo.",

      "Content": "Hi all newbie here. ive recently had a mastectomy because of dcis. turned out I had ductal breast cancer stage 3 and 1 lymph node involved. my surgeon said im cancer free but just precautionary they want to do chemo, radiotherapy and 10 years on tamoxifen. ImÂ  in a difficult position as I cant decide wheather or not to have the chemo, I have one kidney and had surgery a few years ago for an achalasia. My question is does anyone else refuse chemo and just go for radiotherapy and hormone treatment ? am I alone in not wanting it I have a week to get back to oncology.",
