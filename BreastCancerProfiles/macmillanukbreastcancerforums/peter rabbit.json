As for the gym, I'm back there and all is fine... don't feel much like it the chemo week, but the two weeks following I was fine .. I woudn't say I was doing vigourous exercise, have kept off the weights, but am slowly building back up. Going back to the gym has given me back my control.  ",

I voiced my fears and had a portacath implanted yesterday for the last 3 ECs.. seemed the best option as it only requires flushing every 3 weeks or so .. less chance of infection than a PICC line .. and no external bits so no chance of catching it or anything.  Can shower, swim, bathe and everything with a portacath .. wish I'd had it right from the begining now.  I did ask but was told finding veins would be no problem.... nobody mentioned messing your veins up!!!",
