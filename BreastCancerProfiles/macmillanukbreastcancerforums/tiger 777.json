I am very pleased with my new little breast, now 36 c.  It will certainly change my life for the better. I am happy to wear a prothesis. I have recovered well but the exercises are a pain. No infections or seromas. The lymph node clearance under my arm is very stiff but the exercises help with that. The lymph node clearance is the worst bit for me. I didn't want a reconstruction, it's a personal choice I think. I want the fastest recovery possible. Hope that helps. Mo",

It was organised my Macmillan.  I feel a lot better now I have voiced my fears. It has helped me and I feel a lot calmer as a result.  I was finding hard to keep busy as I am recovering from surgery. So I have a lot of time to fill.  I have had Counselling before and I also found that painting abstract paintings help me as well. I just paint randomly\u200b. I know this is a bit out there but I thought I would mention it as it helped me. Having this web site also helps.",
