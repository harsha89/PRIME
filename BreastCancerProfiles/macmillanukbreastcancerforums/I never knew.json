      "Content": "I\u2019m in Hereford where we have a small district hospital who don\u2019t seem to take much notice of Macmillan/NICE. They faffed around so much after two inadequate lumpectomies that I felt I couldn\u2019t wait any longer and accepted what they offered, immediate mastectomy and implant with expander. I do have a referral in now to Birmingham for a later reconstruction either Diep or Tram. Need to get results first, and find out whether or not I will need radiotherapy   I thought I was getting on well, just one drain in, then I accidentally tugged on it tonight and it\u2019s really sore. Hopefully I\u2019ll get them to remove it tomorrow. My own fault really.  Hope you are still doing ok x",

      "Content": "Hi Rolybun, I had my  mastectomy eight days ago, and like you was advised to wear sports bras. The problem is, my un-operated boob is 44DD, and the operated one with a expandable implant appears to be about half that size, and mostly under my armpit!   So, any type of bra just gapes over the one that had the operation, and will clearly not be giving any support. I found in Sainsbury\u2019s some crop tops that go up to my size, and they seem the best option for now. Not quite comfortable enough to wear in bed, but okay the rest of the day, giving some support on both sides.  Did your hospital give you a reduction at the same time as the mastectomy? Mine were absolutely adamant they would not do that, so it looks as though I\u2019m going to be living with asymmetry for quite some time.",

      "Content": " I had my mastectomy and expander implant in September. It all healed up relatively quickly, and apart from hating the shape of the implant, and the saggy skin under it that looked like a double chin, I thought I was doing fine. I had a couple of sessions to put saline in the implant, and stopped when the treated breast was just a little smaller than the other one. And then, just before Christmas, the treated breast swelled up quite badly. It felt very lumpy and tight. I went back to see the surgeon who said it was fluid, and was nothing to worry about. The BCN suggested I massaged it and kept doing my exercises, but this hasn\u2019t made any difference. She also suggested that maybe I was wearing a bra with enough support, but at 42 D I was able to find very little that was comfortable, but did feel well supported. I was just wondering if anyone else had experienced this, and how long it took to go away.  Is there anything I can do to make it go quicker? I really don\u2019t get on well with my surgeon, I find him patronising and dismissive, so I don\u2019t want to go back to see him unless I absolutely have to. There is no redness or soreness so I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s not an infection. If it is like this much longer I feel inclined to ask for some of the saline to be removed. Has anyone had that done?  Has anyone had that done? I\u2019m hoping to have the implant replaced by a DIEP in a year or so, I had decided just to ensure the implant until then, but it\u2019s worse than I thought it would be.  I had decided just to ensure the implant until then, but it\u2019s worse than I thought it would be.

      "Content": " Thank you all for your replies. I contacted the breast cancer nurses at the hospital. I hope they would be able to see me themselves, but they sorted out an appointment with the consultant. He says there is a lot of fluid, probably because he left quite a lot of skin after the  mastectomy, apparently that will make it easier for the diep if I have that in the end. So in the short term he wasn\u2019t worried, and in the longer term the nurses have arranged for me to see the oedema specialist. He said that taking liquid out of the implant might make things worse, by causing a bigger gap between my skin and the implant, which might just fill with more fluid. I think that all made sense, and I did feel slightly more listened to than on some of my appointments.  Before I will get a definite answer about the diep I have to lose some weight. So far I have lost 12 KG out of the target of 19, so I\u2019m almost there. I will contact the regional centre where the diep would happen to see how soon they can complete my assessment. And if that turns out to go nowhere, I will probably have the temporary implant  removed sooner rather than later.  Nothing is straightforward, but at least  I am being taken seriously now.",

After a lot of thinking, I had a second lumpectomy, which also didn\u2019t work, but at least it meant when I had the mastectomy I knew that was the only option. Looking back, I\u2019m still glad I tried the second time. Good luck with your decision. ",
