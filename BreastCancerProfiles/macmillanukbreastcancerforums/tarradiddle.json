      "Content": "hiya tracey,   I had mine done two weeks after finishing radiotherapy. when is a safe time depends on whose advice you take, I researched it on line and mainly got the idea that I should wait a year (no please cancer, just carry on taking over my life why don't you!) spoke to the radiographers and they just said wait a couple of weeks after finishing. I didn't have chemo so that might chance things? I had mine at the top of my back in the centre, am having another one in two weeks time on my healthy arm :-) xx live life, no regrets!!! xx  ",

      "Content": "Hiya, i think that the way that i am dealing with peoples reactions is changing daily, i got diagnosed last week (feels like it was years ago!) i had only told a couple of close friends that i was going for tests, on the day i got diagnosed i told my family and children, sent out a round robin email to my closer friends, and then the day after posted it on facebook, i just wanted it out there, no worrying about who knows and who doesnt. i told people i didnt want sympathy, i was just going to be me with an extra lump for a while. some people i have really had to build myself up to face - my elderly neighbour who is 86 puts his foot in it all the time and i knew that he would start telling me about people who had died, plus my god father cries all the time so i havent spoken to him directly yet! i have had some lovely support from the most unexpected people that has blown me away, on the other hand even after a week i am considering leaving my job due to the complete lack of support - not one person in my team could achnowledge it or has bothered to ask me how i am - all in all i feel like this time of my life will be a bit of a shedding and hopefully rejuvinating time where i get to see the people in my life from a new perspective and maybe make some changes, i imagine that there will be people who i count as friends now who will be aqaintances by the end of my treatment, and people on forums like this who i have never met who i will end up classing as dear friends, not much help to your origional question about how to deal with reactions sorry, but my fingers just started typing lol xxx",
