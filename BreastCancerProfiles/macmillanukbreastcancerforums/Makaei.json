    "Content": "I was referred for genetic testing/counselling following my two sisters being diagnosed, one with primary breast cancer, the other wiith secondary breast cancer. I was told I had a moderate risk as there was a family history of other cancers amongst aunties and uncles but not our parents. I am a moderate risk also for bowel cancer. Its hard to say how I feel about myself as I have been concentrating on the loss of one sister and the imminent loss of the other. I think it may hit me more when my second sister has passed away (something which is heavy on my mind at the minute). I didn't find the counsellor much help as she just took down the history and completed the forms for testing my sisters blood and the samples from my deceased sister. Then a few months later I saw a Professor who just told me I would be monitored and what risk I had. The monitoring so far has been very little which I am not happy about but like I say, I am concentrating on my sister. If you feel it would put your mind at rest to be tested I would say go with it because if it has been on your mind for some time then I would think that you need to go ahead to put this to rest. I hope you can make the decision that is best for you. Love E.",
