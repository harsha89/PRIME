    "Content": "Hi Diagnosed in May 2011 followed by lumpectomy in June, had 2 weeks off work. Began radiotherapy middle of August through to middle of September and worked all through. I was lucky that I was able to get my appointments just after lunch time so could work the morning, bus to hospital, zapped and bus home. Coped reasonably well with the tiredness although long day, getting up at 5am, 30 min bus to work, then 20 min bus to hospital at lunch time, then bus home arriving around 4-4.30pm. By the mid september was totally exhausted and got signed off at doctors for 2 weeks, followed by another 6 weeks and then a phased return to work for the next month. Have to say my employers were brilliant throughout and if needed could just go home or phone in if not feeling great and staying at home, all this time never saw anyone from Occupational Health they just accepted it and had advised I could take all the time I needed to recover. On hindsight if I had of known how tired I would feel would not have continued working throughout. Good luck with rest of your treatment and do what is best for you and none else",
