    "Content": "Hi, this could sound incredibly rude, but I shaved my head for another charity & donated my hair to be made into a wig. The girl who revived my hair was called Lucy. It is not wrong to want to shave your head to support a charity, I am (in the future) going to shave my head because Lewii had to before he died his terminal cancer destroyed his life and he wanted people to shave heads. People are beautiful with or without hair. You don't have to have cancer to not have hair, it is not acceptable to judge people based upon their actions to HELP a community.",
