      "Content": "Hi everyone, I am a bit late getting to this conversation but it is really good to know someone else is having weekly Taxol, I haven't met anyone so far! I was diagnosed last August and following a mastectomy and lymph clearance have had 4 three weekly Fec sessions and am on my 7th weekly Taxol. As the weeks are going by though I ache really badly and the nausea is coming back - anyone else have this? I keep telling myself the Tax isn't so bad but I feel wrecked! Any tips? xx",

      "Content": "Hi Butterfly, I had cording down to my elbow following mastectomy and lymph clearance last September. I have been seeing a lymph nurse who has transformed the puckering left after surgery and has completely smoothed out all cording. May be worth asking at chemo tomorrow? You are probably fast asleep by now but I had chemo today so too restless for sleep! Good luck, hugs, Gwynnie",
