      "Content": "hello Thank you so much for sharing your your experiences and thoughts it really means so much to me as I am at the begining of the long road you have travelled. It really helps to know that it is survivable. On wednesday  I am going into hospital for surgery for the first time in my life and am really frightened. To read your diary really helps as I realise I need to be brave as I'm not the only one. I am extreamly lucky to have a supportive family and wonderful friends but to listen to and share with 'strangers'  who really understand my fears is helping no end. I really wish you and your daughter every happiness and hope that your new year really brings you all that you are hoping for take care xx  ",
