      "Content": "Good Morning Chloe & G&J,  Thanks both for your replies.  Yes duly noted about websites - I'm trying not to google - hence asking here, and my appointment is before lunch today.  I'm clinging onto the hope that they're most likely benign, I will be asking if they're clustered or what patterns they're in and any areas of 'concern' for the future. I am hoping I come away feeling a bit more educated about my scan this time than fearing the worst if that makes sense. Fingers x'd anyhow! ",

      "Content": "I don't really know where to post this, sorry if it's wrong being here.  I have annual screening (I'm 43 now) and have had for nearly 10 years due to early bc in my mum (who had a long remission and then mets to the bowel which were terminal 14 years ago).  I had a fibroadenoma removed at the start of my screening but they mentioned calcifications last time I was screened. They assumed I knew about them but it didn't hit me till I got home and googled what they were. I phoned up a BCN was lovely and got my notes and confirmed they were microcalcifications in both breasts.  I am due my screening tomorrow and am worried now that I should be more pro-active in asking the right questions in my appointment. I just don't know what I should be asking. I have read about the scoring they give them as to whether they are benign etc, is it Rads I think it's called, but other than this not sure what to ask. Should I be pressing for a biopsy if there is any change in them?  Thanks for any help or support you can offer. ",

Bi-Rads.. got it!  I will try and write down some questions in the morning and be prepared to ask the Bi-Rad rating for them.  Also appreciate the links you posted as hadn't found those in my googling which I have tried but am at the stage of my brain being a jumble and finding it hard not having anyone to talk to about this. Fingers x'd I'm anxious for nothing.  Thanks again for your support and advice. ",

      "Content": "Well it was a complete whirlwind visit with the clinic Dr who hadn't seen my mammo's before I walked into the room and though he viewed them outback from me he can't have looked at them long. When I asked if there were any changes to microcalcifications He assured me all fine and will be double checked and a recall made if any issues found.  Am moving onto 2 yearly mammograms now as I'm over 40 and they're prepping me for 3 yearly screening when I'm over 50.. bit daunting but figured that would happen. I am due back to see them next year at the clinic but not sure what they'll actually 'do' at that stage. I still didn't manage to come away feeling more 'informed' but the all fine was enough for me.  Thanks for the support and advice, wish you all well and strength for when you need it. ",
