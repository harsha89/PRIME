    "Content": "Hi All,  Im new to the community and have enjoyed reading your heart warming posts. I was diagnosed in May with DCIS, saw the medical oncologist and surgeon a week after the diagnosis, then a week after the visit, I received another letter confirming I had Inflammatory Breast Cancer, I saw the medical Oncologist 2 weeks after I received the letter to discuss treatments. I have now received another letter saying I have advanced Localised carcinoma HER 2???? I have had chemo 1, before this my breast was getting a lot softer,  I then had chemo, saw the oncologist a week after, who confirmed the tumour had shrunk, must be the chemo???? So I am now seeing a private oncologist at the end of July, because I am confused, I am also seeing my GP who has been very helpful. The oncology team had all my scan results and  Biopsy results, yet  i have 3 different diagnosis. ",
