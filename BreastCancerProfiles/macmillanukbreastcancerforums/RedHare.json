    "Content": "Hello!   I get sore eyes often from chemo and though a few of my eyelashes have fallen out, most them, and my eyebrows have stayed. I think it could be either, not everyone loses their eyelashes. The first time I had chemo I lost them all but this time, as mentioned, I have kept them and my eyebrows.   If it is something that is causing you a lot of grief I would talk to your consultant about it as they can prescribe you soothing eye drops to help.   Hope this helps!   RedHare",
