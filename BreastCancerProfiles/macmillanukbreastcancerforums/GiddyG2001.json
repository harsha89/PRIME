      "Content": "Hi all, I hope it's ok to post on here for my mum. She's finding all this quite hard so I'm helping her out with using these forums. My mum is 72 and in Nov was diagnosed with stage 2 breast cancer in the milk ducts. She had a masectomy and lymph node  clearance in Dec and Jan respectively and was told she would be starting chemo today. However, this has now had to be postponed and it was this that I wanted advice on really. She was healing well after the lymphnode clearance but there was a lot of fluid building up. It got to the point 7 days ago when they attached a bag to her wound to drain the lymphatic fluid as it was that plus blood and mucus that was building up. We've been told this is all normal and that unfortunately she can't start chemo until the wound has healed. Which is obviously making her anxious as she geared herself up to start, then has had to get herself out of that frame of mind again. She's also concerned about her wound healing as she went back to the breast care nurse again today who emptied the bag and attached a new one. She saw the wound for the first time today and said she was shocked as it had gone from 2 blisters into quite a big hole. I think above everything, she's worried that whilst she still has the bag attached, the wound won't heal and she won't be able to start chemo.  She came home and apparently removed the bag and my sister and her have dressed the would with some bandage. Obviously I want to support her and understand her concerns about the wound not healing, but the bag must be doing something. Sorry for the waffle! I guess what I'm asking is has anyone got any words of advice or been through a similar situation to this themselves?  Thanks for reading xxx",

      "Content": "Hi Can I ask all of you when you talk about delaying chemo - is that a delay from your original chemo date or is that from your operation? Eg my mum had a lymph node clearance on Jan 8th, was meant to start chemo on Feb 16th but this has been delayed today yet again because her wound hasn't healed, so that's 4 weeks from the original chemo date and 8 weeks since the operation. Trying to work out how long it is usual to have chemo delayed by, before we need to start worrying!",
