      "Content": "I am new to this too and whilst I can\u2019t comment or offer advice on your specific treatment I know the waiting is the hardest bit.  You\u2019re in the right place this is a great forum with lots of lovely people offering words of encouragement. I\u2019m sure someone will comment  I know how you feel it\u2019s torture but what I\u2019ve learnt in my short time is try to keep busy and set yourself short tasks that involve being with others. That time to forget just for a short while is therapy.  Sending you big hugs and positive thoughts  Xx ",

      "Content": "I\u2019m 3 sessions in and have had no real major side effects from FEC other than a mild case of constipation so have something at the ready.  For me it\u2019s the injections after that wipe me out. All but useless. After the first one I wake the following morning with what feels like I\u2019ve done 10 rounds with Tyson. Tiredness like I\u2019m jet lagged but after 48 hours I\u2019m getting back into the swing of things. I also struggle with weird headaches, not your usual headache but I\u2019m convinced that\u2019s the chemo and hair thing.  I have POM juice but do take the sickness even if you feel ok as it does creep up on you.  Listen to your body and don\u2019t fight it.  I\u2019ve got used to doing things when I can but accepting that it\u2019s ok to sleep ALOT  Good luck, hope like me you your not too affected.  Xx ",

What a fool.  This morning it\u2019s started. I have short hair but it\u2019s still scary.  My question to you all, is did you wait or did you bite the bullet and shave it off? ",

      "Content": "Hi Concepta  I am exactly the same, two rounds done, round 3 next week. It\u2019s the injections that get me post chemo. I\u2019m in a daze for a good 36 hours and sleep so much. Feel like I\u2019ve done a massive work out. Limbs ache and am zapped of energy.  Like you I\u2019m thinking it\u2019s going to come but they did say you might breeze through it or it could hit you hard further in but for now I\u2019ll thank my lucky stars it\u2019s going just fine.  Xx ",
