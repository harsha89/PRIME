      "Content": "Just wondering if anyone has had peripheral neuropathy in part of body other than hands and feet. I had Paclitaxel which finished in October 2018. Since February I have suffered pain and numbness in hip, groin and lower back. I saw consultant who said he thought it was due to chemo but I\u2019m still worried as it\u2019s getting more intense. ",
