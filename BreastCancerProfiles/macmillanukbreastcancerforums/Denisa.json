I even stopped working during the chemo I was on sick pay till I haven't finished the chemo. I started travelling after all treatment finished.I didn't want to end up in a hospital with infection.

Had 4xEC and 3xT and my hair started just fall out after the 4th cycle because I didnt want to use it anymore too much hassle around waiting for the cap because they just have couple of them and the time consuming. Maybe if i would use till end i wouldnt loose it.Anyway my hair started to grow back within month the treatment finished.Now more then 1 year finishing I have thicker hair and have ponytail. First few min.are not very comfortable but with paracetamol is ok.I took my own towel because when they disconnect it all the ice will melt and you can be wet around your neck so i just had the towel like a scarf.

About the swimming they told me to avoid crowded places, because your immunity will be low and swimming pools are sometimes full of germs and bacteria.

The biggest issue was when my statutory sick pay finished.financially was a struggle.Anyway the employer should do arrangments for you and cant discriminate you.Now I am back working full time hours.You shouldnt use your holyday for appointments,can ask for day off or something.I dont know really the law but you can contact the Citizens Bureau Advice and ask them.

Chemo left me bit mentally drained but I must say it worked and saved my life actually in last minute because it was grade 3 and 1 lymphnode involved.After chemo had no lymphnode involved and the tumor was downgraded to 2. I know its hard but i am glad i did it.I am only 41 and every percent for me that the cancer doesnt come back counts for me. First i went without picc line but after 2nd cycle I had to agree with it because my veins were hurting me.For me even the picc line experience wasnt nice but in the end it was a neccessary thing.Its was annoying bit because i couldnt have a bath properly because i worried to get it wet and i was constantly checking if the tube is not coming out.Just be carefull not to lift anything heavy with that arm where your picc line will be and keep eye on it. Anyway nearly 2 years from treatment i am still here and healthy.No side effects and hair like before chemo. Anyway just look after yourself and please dont google about any statistics.Eat healthy and drink lots of water. Wishing you good luck and sending hugs.",

I have order also this R1 gel but I have wasted 60 pound on it because even I bought it on the official website it was never delivered.And honestly I think it's just a business.
