      "Content": "Hi everyone, wonder if anyone can help. I was diagnosed BC on February 9th, grade 3. 3 tumours in a line. I was originally told i would have a MX but when I asked for an immediate reconstruction I was offered chemo to try and shrink the lumps before surgery. I had my third taxotere 18th April and will now have three FEC. I had a us scan last Tuesday and the tumours are nowhere to be seen!! good news I think. However my fingernails are really sore and look as if they are bleeding underneath. I did mention this last time to Oncologist who told me it is a side effect of chemo. Has anyone else had this problem, what is it ? and how did you manage? Thanks everyone. Mary",

      "Content": "Hi All, thanks for replies. It is really heartwarming to know that everyone on here is so supportive, unlike real life!!! Spent all day yesterday at the hospital having blood tests etc after contacting BCN. Got another lot of anti biotics. Apparently Tax effects the nerve endings and can leave permanent damage! I am hoping this is temporary as I cannot do buttons up and have difficulty writing with a pen (thank God for keyboard). Half way through my chemo, 3 FEC and then op. Getting through one day at a time.   Big hugs to everyone and try to keep positive.xxxxxxx",
