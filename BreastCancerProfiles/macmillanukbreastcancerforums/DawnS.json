    "Content": "hi hun, not sure if can or will be of help to you but will pass on what little personal experience i have of this op. I had double mastectomy just under 3 weeks ago. had planned for diep free flap reconstruction immediately. op was due to take 8 hours but ended up taking 12 hours. not that i knew anything about it at the time obv. it took so much longer as one side was perfectly uneventful and the other side despite much trying (8 attempts) the blood supply kept failing. so surgeon made the decision to fit an implant. Â I woke well from anaesethic and had no ill effects apart from being very thirsty. yes was disappointed to find i had an implant as wanted the diep free flap. the implant side is more tender than the free flap. but neither side is very painful. honestly the worst part of this has been my arms. as said is nearly 3 weeks and my arms are still painful. couldnt move them at all for 24 hours after op and then only a little bit to start. cant wear anything on my arms even now as they hurt so much. apparently is due to nerve damage (not permanent) and the fact that they were outstretched for the whole op. Yes I would rather have not had the op but that is a given for anybody. I would much rather have not ha breast cancer. but I have recovered very well. so well in fact that hospital dont want to see me again until is time for nipple reconstruction. but the free flap breast looks very much as did before the op, the implant side is same minus outline for nipple. surgeon was brilliant. would wish her on you if were possible.i dont think i could have been in better hands or taken better care of. i hope your op goes well and without incidence. best of luck and keep positive xxx",
