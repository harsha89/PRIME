      "Content": "Hi Icarter Have read that almond oil is good but I used bio oil as I already had some for my scar - used it when I first lost my hair as my scalp was very tender and now my hair is starting to grow back my scalp again is sore and despite only having a quarter of an inch managed to get dandruff! The bio oil has helped but perhaps any oil would do. Pat567  ",

      "Content": "Hi I am no expert but from my understanding of radiotherapy you are given a set dose this is then divided into what they refer to as fractions - and this is the amount that you get each day that you go.  For example I initially was going to be given 50gy over 25 session - each day I would have recieved a dose of 2gy.  After considerable discussion I have opted to have 40gy over 15 sessions which means I will be getting 2.66gy each day as there are studies to show that this is as effective with the same side effect profile as 50gy over 25 sessions.  You really need to talk again to the consultant as once you start your treatment find out what dose you are being given and what the options are, you cannot change the way it will be given or just stop short as you will not recieve the full dose. I am very fair colouring (a lot of red hair in the family) I had light redish brown hair (now a five o'clock shaddow) and have had 9 of my 15 session no problems as yet with my skin but have been told that side effects usually kick in after two weeks and are at their worst 2 weeks after completing.  I will let you know if I have any problems.  Hope this is helpful Pat",
