      "Content": "Hi Ladies, My little monster is coming out tomorrow on Halloween!! Besides the tumour, ultrasound and biopsy of a suspect lymph node confirmed a positive result and I need to have an auxiliary node clearance. My surgeon has offered me the choice of a partial clearance or total.  Does anyone have any experience of this? My ultrasound showed no other abnormal lymph nodes and I am leaning towards partial so as to reduce the risk of lymphoedema.  But as I will need radiotherapy anyway, would this make any difference?  I am waiting for more results and hoping I will have a clearer picture for treatment after my lumpectomy. Thanks in advance for any thoughts. ",

      "Content": "Hi Ladies, I\u2019m grade 3 , ER and PR positive and HER+, no family history of ANY cancer. My initial diagnosis was grade 2 HER2 - but changed after the pathology came back from my lumpectomy showing 20% HER2 +.  At the time it was hard to deal with but I\u2019ve decided not to let it get me down.  I\u2019ve been inspired to take each step as it comes and not worry about what might happen. I\u2019ve tried to change the things I can control, eat loads of veggies and mainly fish/eggs/lentils and other sources of protein. I get my yoga mat out most days and place it right by my bedroom window where on sunny days the light comes shinning through. I observe my living winter cherry tree, knowing by spring it will be blooming beautiful pink blossoms. Very fitting for BC I think!! I use it\u2019s energy and life force to clear all negative thoughts from my mind and I accept energy and light from my garden to heal me.  Accepting healing is important. It doesn\u2019t have to be from your garden but try to find something that makes you feel good. You can accept it from someone giving you a massage or a healer for example.  You can accept it from a pet, or from doing an activity you enjoy but while you do this if your thoughts take you back to cancer, throw them out and return to your positive mindset.  Maybe you only manage 5 mins a day but it\u2019s like anything the more you do it the better you become at it! Learning simple yoga poses helps you focus on the physical side , just be careful if you have just had surgery or have lyphodema , check with your BC nurses.  I\u2019ve just had my third round of Chemo today and took some Lorazepam before to help with the nausea I had on my second cycle. I slept most of the way through it with no nausea and still tolerated the cold cap.  Throughout my research I\u2019ve found many stories of Cancer survivors who stress how important it is to have a positive mind.  Some of these are patients who have terminal cancer yet against the odds they continue to survive.  I personally know three ladies who have had BC ten years ago, HER+ and ER,PR + and they are all going strong!  Positive stories are certainly uplifting, maybe we should try and collect some.  Remember our minds/brains and above all our spirit are our strongest assets, what gave us the advantage over less developed Neanderthals. The human race today survived because our brains worked out the best methods of survival.  Can you tell I\u2019m reading \u2018Sapiens\u2019 at the moment?!  Breast Cancer Haven is a charity that supports anyone affected by BC for free. Check out breastcancerhaven.org.uk . You can make appointments to see councillors /therapists  also go to classes or workshops.  The flagship London centre is in Effie Road , Fulham. There are some costs for classes etc. I\u2019m planning on attending some at some point.  Sorry I\u2019m rambling on!! Hope this has helped a little.  All the best. Fiona ",
