      "Content": "Hi Chaza  I\u2019m on Tamoxifen plus Zoladex injections as despite being 55 when diagnosed I was stillhaving regular periods so not yet menopausal. I started off on Exemestane + Zoladex but had horrible bone and joint pains with that. Still have some but not as bad. My bone scan at the start showed no signs of Osteoporosis luckily.  My mum takes Letrozole and she has osteoporosis but now takes calcium tablets to help with that  Hope your Oncologist helps to guide you to the right meds Take care Jan ",

      "Content": "Hi I had similar where two areas didn\u2019t have clear enough margin - had cavity shave to try to get one and only one was then clear and ended up having a 3rd op after chemo to get fullclearance. My surgeon wanted 1mm minimum and said that they had got clearance of 0.2mm which was still clearance but she preferred to make sure bigger margin.  Personally I think I would try and get more clearance rather than the booster Radiotherapy as I too got Breast and slight arm lymphedema after Radiotherapy.  Hopefully you will get to speak to your surgeon soon x",

      "Content": "Oh bless you I feel for you! My Oncologist was totally straight with me looked me in the eye and said I would lose my hair (I had TAC)  so I knew from the off no point even trying cold cap which in a weird way was a help cos no hope from the beginning and I was resigned to it coming out - that said it was still a shock when it  started to come out just before my 2nd chemo - I remember sobbing in the shower.  I decided to have mine shaved off as my scalp was hurting and my hair altho still covering my scalp was very thin. It was always the one thing I took great care of so I was devastated to lose it but felt empowered by deciding to shave it before it came out. I had 2 wigs - first one was synthetic and I never really liked it - 2nd was real hair that I could curl and style and from the first moment I wore it I felt like me again - my mum cried when she saw me in it because she said the smile it put on my face was priceless!  Fast forward 2 years - my last chemo was 4/3/16 and my hair is back to normal - as thick and shiny as it ever was. In that 2 years I\u2019ve discovered that my real colour is actually grey (haha who knew!), I rocked a short pixie crop for a while and embraced my chemo curls before they grew out. My scalp was absolutely fine as hair regrew and I was able to colour it after 5 months.  It\u2019s sh*t at the time and I sure as hell looked more old bald man than Sinead O\u2019Connor style bald but I got through it and in a weird way it gave me confidence - if you can cope with bald nothing much bothers you after!  Wishing you luck on your journey and here\u2019s to a stubbly head and regrowth very soon xx  Ps invest in a soft sleep cap - lots on eBay - it\u2019s surprisingly cold at night in bed with no hair! ",
