      "Content": "Hi there I have been on Arimidex since January this year.  I have put on a stone+ in weight since starting this hormone therapy. I am not a big eater and what I do eat is healthy.  Lots of fruit, veggies, protein, salads etc.  I don't eat between meals and rarely have cakes,biscuits chocolate sweets etc.  I drink peppermint tea, diet coke sometimes and wine/G&T, perhaps once a week. I walk, go to red hot yoga 2/3 times a week too but the weight just keeps coming. I hate how my body has changed, my tummy is especially bad but it's all over, my legs, bottom and even on my back and from what I can find out it is going to get even worse. Has anyone experienced the same? What or is there anything more you can do to help yourself? Chrissi P x",

      "Content": "Hello Kate    Many thanks for your reply. I have taken time to read various posts regarding the increase in weight that some ladies face once they are on the hormone therapy. For some ladies there is no weight gain, I wish I was one of them but hey that's not to be. I am not a big eater and quite often don't have an appetite at all. I went onto the Slimming World diet for a time but found that the volume of food was too much for me. However I do still cook with little or no oils or fats which is good. I do take regular exercise too, obviously it's not enough.  Since joining the McMillan site I realise that my issue is so small in comparison to many of the ladies out there who are in constant pain, have to cope with a multitude of drugs, facing chemo, radiotherapy etc etc. It makes me feel so guilty, ungrateful, ungracious, unworthy and even vane. I hope I'm none of those things. It's just when you have always been able to keep a fairly trim figure and suddenly it goes to pot it makes me feel angry I suppose. I hate myself physically but more so emotionally.  I hope you are able to keep well as you continue on your journey too.    Bye for now.    Best wishes.    Chrissi P",
