    "Content": "Hello, I\u2019ve just completed my 4th of 6 THCP cycles. I really didn\u2019t know what to expect from the first and it would be fair to say that at that time I felt absolutely wretched - crushing fatigue, nausea/sustained vomiting, chemo brain, etc and there were a few \u2018tears before bedtime\u2019. The positive news is that subsequent cycles have proven easier to deal with - medication changes (Emend for the sickness), I had a better understanding of what to expect so was better prepared mentally and had realised that very small meals taken often (eggs, soup, porridge) worked between what was for me fairly constant sleep for a few days following chemotherapy. I also realised that I could \u2018get through this\u2019, having had some fairly dark thoughts during the first cycle. It must be so difficult for you seeing your daughter go through this but please reassure her, and yourself, that each cycle is different and hopefully she too will find subsequent cycles more manageable.Â ",
