      "Content": "Hi, I have had chemo followed by left breast removal and 17 nodes from armpit, surgen now wants me to have radiotherapy but this would mean a 60 mile round trip each day plus bridge fees, I do not enjoy the best of health having suffered a stroke/heart problems 10 years ago and wonder if anyone else has not had radiotherapy and does anyone know what my chances are if I refuse this treatment or is it possible to go less days per week but over a longer period",
