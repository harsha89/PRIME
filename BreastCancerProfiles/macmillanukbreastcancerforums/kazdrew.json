    "Content": "Gosh, it sounds like I've got off fairly lightly compared to other members experience. I have just had my last rt yesterday, my boob is sore and red but there isn't any broken skin. I do keep getting sharp pains in there and under my arm but apart from that all normal. It seems that I was quite lucky (if you can use that word when talking about cancer), but we caught the lump really early and only needed rt (not chemo thank god). I was diagnosed at the end of March but it's only now that I feel upto discussing things with other sufferers so this is quite a big step for me.",
