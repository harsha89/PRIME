      "Content": "I am halfway through my FEC treatment,  has anyone else experienced loads of lower back ache,  I tend to sleep in one position mostly on my back,  My op scar is still healing and I have a Groshong line fitted on the opposite side!  So it is not yet comfortable to sleep on my side. Should I get this back ache checked out - ??? And who should I mention it too, my GP, or oncologist?? I know that the white blood cell injection can cause ache's etc - just not sure what to do.",

      "Content": "Hi Trish,  and thanks for your reply,  I'm not worried about my hair, I have it very short anyway, and I can't even eat Ice cream without getting brain freeze, so I won't be using the cold cap - I just have to have Chemo then Tamoxifen - its more of a mop up/ just in case chemo, they are confident they got it all and I had nothing in my nodes. I am sure I will have more visitors as well as the nurses - in fact my husband is in charge of the visiting times - for friends and family.  I haven't decided yet about reconstruction.  How has it been for you?  Still plenty of time to decide in the month's to come.   It's kinda growing on me - so long as its a tummy tuck job  haha. Thanks again -  June x",
