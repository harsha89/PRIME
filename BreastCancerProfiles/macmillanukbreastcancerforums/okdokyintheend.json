      "Content": "Hello Kat I think ringing the docs first thing is the right......and only... thing to do. There is no real point in saying 'don't panic' and 'stay calm' (but if you are  managing to well done).  The lump could be a cyst or could be cancerous but either way you need to find out.  The only thing that will make your worries subside fully is a diagnosis from the professionals.  When I found my lump the whole process from initial examination at the GP's to getting the results back was a very quick one, hopefully it will be the same for you. I want you to know that although my lump did indeed turn out to be cancerous, which was a shock, it worked out alright in the end .....and the treatment process was nowhere near as bad as I imagined it, in fact there were even some positives! I found my medical team to be brilliant and very kind too, the support I got from Macmillin was amazing and best of all I got the all clear a few short months later. I'm keeping all things crossed for you that the lump is something innocent but if not please please take heart, though it may feel like the end of the world IT'S NOT.  Breast Cancer can be and VERY OFTEN IS BEATEN!!!! Keep your chin up :-) I'm sending you a hug x ",

      "Content": "Hello again Kat I think the Drs would definitely give you a clear indication of what they think is going on and if indeed it is cancer they will tell you immediately they have biopsy results. Its absolutely a very quick process, understandably, so I think you should go with what they've told you as nothing is hidden or disguised. I know its hard not to worry till you get a 'definite answer' but try to take your mind off it as much as possible until then. Take care",

      "Content": "Hello Linds I'm sending a hug to you straight away as being frightened is a terrible feeling. Firstly, anxiety disorder or not it's understandable you're scared, the majority of women finding a lump would be.  Waiting till Friday to find out more will seem like a long time too and probably harder for you with your heightened health concerns. As a life long worrier myself you have my sympathies, it doesn't matter how many people tell you 'it'll probably be fine' is the' what if it's not' that the problem! However that said finding a lump isn't a death sentence no matter how frightening it is, there could be all sorts of diagnosis that don't involve cancer at all.  Even if you do get bad news it's not the end of the world; these days Breast Cancer is very very treatable and is often is completely beaten by many. In my experience you can trust what the professionals tell you (so don't go worrying they're 'playing things down') although be prepared for further waiting as you may not get the final, definite answer till the results of various tests are through (that doesn't usually take too long though). I think what you need to do is try to find ways to manage your anxiety as best you can till then.  What works for me is distraction, setting myself goals, even if its only small ones, and focusing on doing things you enjoy or will help you feel better. There are always people on here who realise what a difficult time this can be so reach out to them if you need to. I know it's tough Linds, but be kind to yourself and remember getting through this is definitely 'do-able' Take care now and all the best....and good luck for Friday! xx",

      "Content": "Dear Kate, I definitely definitely don't think you are alone in feeling the way you do.  It was EXACTLY the same for me, initially a tremendous relief ( which felt a bit surprising because I hadn't realised I'd been feeling that worried) however the next day I seemed to be very gloomy indeed.  That made me angry at myself because I felt I should of been shouting 'HURRAH' at everyone I met. In actual fact other people seemed more delighted than me, inside myself I felt at best numb and at worse morose. I was grateful, truly I was and I understood others faced a far far bleaker outcome but I just couldn't find my 'positive bounciness' (if that's even a word) that I'd managed to keep hold of even whilst going through treatment. I just couldn't understand why my get up and go disappeared and was replaced by tears and to be totally honest- apathy.  I was disgusted at my reaction and self pity. However when I discussed my feelings at my 'Where Now?' group another member (to whom I am indebted to for sharing) told me she'd been EXACTLY THE SAME TOO!  She went on to say it was 'the worse week so far' in her experience with cancer  and she felt sorry for her partner having to put up with her 'moods'  I think recovery is a rollercoaster of all sorts of thoughts and feelings and even if we are doing well physically it takes a lot longer to regain our emotional equilibrium. Our outlook may change daily (or even hourly sometimes) as we progress back to 'normal'.  Physical bruising and scars may be 'healing nicely' or be even well healed but that doesn't mean all is hunky dory in our mental health department.  In my experience those unseen wounds take a bit of 'nursing' before they fully recover. I hope that doesn't sound too bleak; its absolutely not meant to.  What I want to say is give it time Kate, and be kind to yourself in the process.  I find I have days when I feel great and others when I'd like to curl up in to a ball.  I try to set myself challenges, even if it is only a small one some days, because achieving a goal, however tiny, is good.  On days that I'm feeling down I find things to distract myself with till the feeling passes.  Talking with others that understand is always helpful. Sending a hug",

I'm think today is definitely going to be a good one....I can feel it in me bones lol, hope it's the same for you. Thank you for your time, oh and I LOVE your tag line 'yesterday is history' etc. Its true every new day is a gift (even if, for whatever reason, we don't see it that way at the time) that's why its called 'the present'",

That's all anyone can do and that's absolutely good enough. If you want to msg me that's fine....only thing is I don't know how to do it on here???? Perhaps you click on the picture or the individuals 'posting name' and that takes you to private chat facilities? I've only just joined this site recently so I'm not exactly familiar with all the bits. Anyways whatever you chose Kate wishing you well in every way xx",
