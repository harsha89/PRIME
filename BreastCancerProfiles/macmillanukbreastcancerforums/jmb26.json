      "Content": "Hi everyone, This may seem like a silly question but I was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2011 and was wondering when you counted your five years all clear from. I had a mammogram after all my treatment in June 2012 and was given the all clear, does it start from this date? The reason I ask is because my partner and I wanted to get a mortgage but I cannot get one as I am classed as I risk as I have had cancer. I have tried to get life insurance but for obvious reason they have all been refused and was told to try again when I have 5 years all clear. I understand from a business point of view why they say no but is very disheartening to get knocked back after everything you have been through. If anyone has been in a similar situation or have any additional advice it would be gratefully received. Thankyou",

I tried a wig to but it just didnt feel right and there are so many headscarves around at the minute you cant go wrong. I think cutting it short has slowed my hair falling out down. As im now coming up to my 4th session and i still have hair, a few bald patches but thats ok lol. Ul be surprised how comfortable it is when ur used to washing it everyday and all that xx",

After my third fec, they changed the drug to taxotere and i lost pretty much all of it. I finished my chemo on the 23rd June and my hair is already starting to come back which im am very happy about! Hope this helps x",

      "Content": "Hi, You are definately not moaning. I was diagnosed with breast cancer in febuary im 26 and my first reaction was i dont want chemo as i dont want to loose my hair. I started with the cold cap which went fine but hair was coming out. 3 weeks later i tried the cold cap again but couldnt cope with it.Ifound hair was coming out in handfuls everymorning and was getting sick of it so I then decided i would take control of it and cut my hair very short, suprisingly I was fine with it. Its actually quite comfortable lol. I just think of it as im going to get a fresh new lot of hair thats not ruined from my hair straighteners and dying it! I am now coming up to my fourth session and only have the odd bald patch but do still have hair and i think its growing aswell. Im swapping drugs for my fourth session so a bit worried about that but positive thinking and all that. Good luck with the rest of your treatment xx",

      "Content": "Hi Joan, I feel the same about one of the consultants at the hospital i go to. He just seems to want to get rid of me at every clinic. I told him some of the side effects i was having and he brushed them off. I then told him i felt another lump and he completly blanked me. My sister then had to jump in and pretty much make him check me over. He kept telling me it was impossible to have another lump during chemo. Then when he checked me marked an 8cm circle on my breast and told me this was all cancer. Luckily i refused to listen to him and went to see me breast care nurse who confirmed my lump was one cm and this other lump was a bruise from the mri biopsy. My worry is who else he is doing it to, not everyone argues back like me :-) I refuse to see him now. I would speak to one of the nurses there and let them know how you feel and hopefully you may be able to see someone else Good luck with the rest of your treatment xxx",
