      "Content": "I need advice ladies !  Just had my first consultation today  with my consultant who turned out to be a junior registrar, I have been informed my tumour is double the size they originally thought and they have missed possible other tumours in my other breast. Which they now want to examine by ultrasound and do a biopsy tomorrow. I have her2 cancer and already had my first fec treatment, I was told that a double mastectomy was a waste of time due to the nature of the cancer, today I have now been told it is probably going to happen, I am totally confused, upset and angry, if it has gone wrong so far it has....I really have no faith in the system now and have 3 hospitals involved ....one hand doesn't seem to know what the other is doing, there is no central point of contact.....it just feels a mess, a real mess",

      "Content": "Thank you Ronstar, yes my case does sound similar to yours, I had a very detailed ultrasound and biopsy today on what they found, the consultant was amazing clam, knowledgeable and patient in answering my constant questions. Finally someone to speak to it was a relief, I have also taken advise and had my care and treatment moved to a dedicated cancer hospital, where I hope things may run smoother. Thank you for answering my rather fraught message , it made me feel I am not on my own x",
