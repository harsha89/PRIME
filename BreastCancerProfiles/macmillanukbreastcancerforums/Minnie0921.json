      "Content": "Thank you Swolish for sharing your experiences.  Mum went to see the GP today and he said her dizziness could be emotional shock as the whole process has been a bit of a whirlwind and it's now all hitting home.  Fingers crossed xjuliex that you get your results soon.  Mum's appointment is 21 days post operation.  But I guess it depends on where you are and how busy the hospitals are.  Good luck  ",

      "Content": "Good afternoon, I'm just looking for some advise re post lumpectomy and LN removal and how everyone felt afterwards? My mum is 5 days post op and gets periods of feeling dizzy her pain is bearable and she's doing her regular exercises. She's also having her highs and lows with emotions, one would think this is normal as she is now in the horrid stage of the waiting game again for the results before she gets a treatment plan sorted.  Thank you in advance for sharing your experiences. Sending good luck vibes to everyone xx",
