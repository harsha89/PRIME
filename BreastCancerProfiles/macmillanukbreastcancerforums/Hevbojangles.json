Eyebrows looking very very thin this morning, so they have  done well, but a shame they're giving up just before the last one but I'm fine with that. Was it worth the cold cap???

I saved about70% of mine. I have very fine fluff on my legs! and some very fine grey  fluff on my head where I have lost some.   I saw the surgeons yesterday and I have decided on immediate reconstruction, will have an implant but because that will be protected by my moved back muscle I can have an implant despite planned radiotherapy.  No tummy surgery as I have no fat there . But my muscles are good it seems. Also full node clearance.  Provisional date of 28 July.   They suggested a few days holiday before then.  Be Rude Not To.  To  everyone having a horrid time or just starting out..... It does go by.  Sometimes it seemed (to me anyway) too big a mountain, but step by step we get there.  Even a complete wuss like me. X",

But several of us are using it at Addenbrookes, and it seems to be successful so far. Just thought you might like to hear my view,  other ladies seem to happily embrace the baldness.  I so admire them. ",

And I can't.  They are both the same apart from the colour of the new nipple which she will complete with tattoo to colour it in a couple of weeks.  THe  reconstruction was done under local, although there is no feeling in my new breast anyway... All healed up fine.  It's not for everyone, I wasn't sure I could be bothered as I was actually reasonably happy with no nipple.  But it has made an unexpected difference to the way I feel about myself.  Off to Lanzarote next week and have no problem with skimpy tops etc.   Please PM me if you want a  picture.  I too am single now.  and that's a whole other challenge after breastcancer... Haven't got my head round that yet.  Although I have been on several dates ... And I told some of the men and they still wanted to see me again.  Shame I didn't feel the same way!   IF at first you don't succeed......",
