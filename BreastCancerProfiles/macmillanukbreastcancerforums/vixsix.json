      "Content": "Hi I too used the cap for my first cycle, the hair stayed put for nearly 3 weeks, at the 2nd cycle the nurses activly discouraged me from doing it,(the cap), saying it didnt really work. i didnt continue! I had already cut my hair shorter, and by cycle 3 hair was falling out, but as i had such thick hair it still covered my whole head. i just got fed up worrying about it and borrowed some clippers and shaved it off myself, it looked ok. a week before cycle 5 (2 weeks ago)i shaved it again as it had really started to thin and did not look ok. I have found this bit quite hard, and cannot wait for it to grow back It is so difficult contemplating losing your hair I am sure if you carry on using the cap you wont loose all of it. but expect some loss then maybe anything else is a bonus. dont be too hasty with the clippers. hope your treatment goes ok! x",

I cried long and hard, every day, for my hair, for my baby for myself, then one day i woke up and felt better. each day brings a bit more hope, and you gain a little bit more strength, and it gets easier. keep strong x",
