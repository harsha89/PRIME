      "Content": "Hi Lee Thank you for your response and its good to know I'm not on my own with these feelings. I'm sorry to hear that your boyfriend died, that must be so hard to cope with, especially with everything else. I appreciate you sharing. I attend a breast support group but we meet every two months and sometimes you need that support sooner. One of the new members has set up a group on \" what app\" so that helps. I did go to work today and then to radiotheraphy, although tired I felt good, it helps when I dont want to see my family. I live in Birmingham, but thank you for offering to meet up. I think I am finally accepting that I have had Cancer, didnt need to think about it before as too busy going to treatments. Please take care Meeralax x    ",

      "Content": "Hi G n' J Thank you for your response, its good to know I'm not on my own.  I try to be positive and have stayed strong through most of this and supported everyone around me, so they cant see a problem now. I have actually stopped family coming round and prefer my own company, less frustration. I spoke about muscle pain and numbness with the consultant and he said he could prescribe some medication but there would be side effects, my boyfriend was with me and he said \"we dont want that\". I dont want anymore medication with potential side effects, but thats my decision not his......another row, which is why I am happy to spend time on my own. Radiotheraphy is ok, I am getting tired but trying to ignore it until my body says stop.  The daily trek gets to me, too much time on your own to think. Hopefully will get better Meeralax    ",

      "Content": "Hi All I posted this last night, but have been very told that I should be in this group, I asked: I was diagnosed with BC on 10.02.15, have had my chemo, my operation and now half way through 23 sessions of radiotherapy but its getting harder and I feel more lonely if that makes sense. I wore a cold cap throughout my treatment and was lucky to keep my hair, put on weight and everyone says I look healthy and you would never know. I am now feeling the effects of chemo, I ache, feet are numb and feel very sad. I should be happy and grateful but I'm not, feel quite lost, is this normal....... not that any of this is normal.
