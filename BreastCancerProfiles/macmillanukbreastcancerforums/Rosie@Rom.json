      "Content": "Oh I bet you are dreading it, that's normal. You can do it, I felt better with the first few cycles. Also having an MRI scan after 3 cycles that showed the treatment was working helped me to get through.  I would say rest up the week after if you can, I tried to get organised so I have as little to do as possible. It is a shock to the system. You will get through it though.  I'm not really saying that family don't understand as they have all been great. I think people who have been through the treatment can offer more sound advise etc.  Xxx",

      "Content": "Hello again, Bjez and Mrsox,  Thank you for replying. So Bolton and Stockport. Yes we should meet up. I've just done chemo 5 out of 6 so I'm almost there.  I think realistically I'd be better to meet after I've had the last chemo, if that suits where you are on your journey?  We can have a nice summer, support each other xxx",

We can all support each other.  I think this online support is great as I'm single, I have amazing friends and family. Who have been unbelievably supportive and my colleagues but I guess someone else going through the same understands a little more.  Yes I've done 5 of the 6 chemos now so I'm almost there but I am really feeling it now, I think it's all building up.  Thank you for my hug and right back at you.  Rosanna xxxx",

I'm still shocked and almost to the end of the concoction of chemo. I had a cycle on Friday so feeling unwell at the minute but happy I only have to do it one more time!  How are you doing?  Rosanna xx",

      "Content": "Hi  I'm 40 years old and was diagnosed in Oct, the same grade 3 eostrogen sensitive and HER2 +ve so I was told I'd need 6 cycles of chemo first before my op which would be a mastectomy because I had a few tumours in the breast.  I was also quite upset about my hair, it was dark long hair down my back. I had it cut to my shoulders and I've been using the cold cap. I've done 4 of the 6 cycles and I still have a head of hair. It has thinned but I had a lot of hair so you can't tell very much. I'm hopeful I'll keep it throughout the next two cycles.  My advise would be to have a little cut off and maybe do it gradually. I would even say you wouldn't need it shoulder length for the cold cap. It's just so that it's not as heavy pulling on your hair follicles.  Good luck and big hugs  Rosanna xx",
