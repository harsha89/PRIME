      "Content": "Hi I had filigrastin which is the once a day injections to boost blood counts! I remember telling my patients you may get flu like symptoms and feel a little achy!!!!!! Then I ended up being a patient having to self inject & feeling like a bus had hit me! I'm sure some of the achyness was due to the chemo but the rest was due to the injections! My joints ached and couldn't bend my fingers and had a raised temp of 38 degrees! Didn't want to take paracetamol incase the temp was due to infection! Got myself checked over at the hospital & it was decided the temp was due to the filigrastin! The flu like side effects are common and back ache. I found a warm bath & taking parectomol & ibeurophen helped with the aches. I always checked my temp wasn't raised before taking them. Due to the achyness the filigrastin caused I used to hate self injecting! But I reminded myself that if it meant all my chemo was on time and the white cell count didn't drop to 0 (making me neutropenic & prone to infection) the 7 days of feeling a bit poo was worth it! The first lot was the worst the only one that really knocked me. Hopefully the next dose won't be as bad for your sister. It's worth sticking out the side effects but at any stage she doesn't feel well it's also worth getting checked by the team. X",

      "Content": "I was 38 when I found the 'shitbag' in my boob. I've just finished my chemo yesterday!! The 1st cycle of fec left me really nauseous for 5 days but then just stopped woke up one morning and it went! The rest of the cycles I never was as nauseous just queasy which as long as I grazed all day didn't effect me! The doctaxel has left me achy like flu but again after 5 days and paracetamol just stopped! I've managed a few days at work between treatments which helped me to break up the cycles and keep me feeling normal ish! I was lucky to be able to reduce my hours and pick areas of work where I was able to work ( work as as a radiographer so needed to stay away from potential infective patients while taking their X-rays) my blood cell counts did drop between each cycle but my little injections helped boost them and I learnt to go that myself! Sounds hard but sometimes I couldn't work out if I had pierced the skin as it's such a fine needle or maybe watching tv while doing it was a good distraction! :-) I've got surgery within the next few months hopefully a lumpectomy as my tumour shrunk by half with chemo! Then radiotherapy after.... Still a long was to go but I've broken the treatment journey into thirds and ever time we complete a third I'm having a little party ( doing an afternoon champagne tea part for end of chemo) My best bit of advice that I gained by looking after so many patients and it has helped me! Keep your sense of humour laughter is the best medicine! When I knew my hair was gonna fall out I decided to go get a short crop and have it dyed bright purple, stuck 2 fingers up at cancer! It had been shoulder length and physchological watching that fall out would have been harder than short purple hair! Which stayed with me till cycle 2 then clippers out and I decided to rock the bald goddess look! It is a hard journey but I learnt to laugh at things that were happening to my body I couldn't stop them and make it all go away! Yep it is frustrating at times! The side effects aren't forever so I learnt to ride them out as you get to know your body far better than you ever have before in your life! Good luck with it all and it's not all negative Annemarie xx",
