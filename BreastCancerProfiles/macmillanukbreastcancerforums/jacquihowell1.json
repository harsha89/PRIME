    "Content": "Hi my name is Jacqui and I am new to this site, I have invasive lobular breast cancer is this the same as you? I am recovering from just having both breasts removed so I dont know what to say to you except the cancer in my right breast was not picked up on a sacn or mamagram, it was spotted on an MRI scan. I would have opted for both breasts to be removed even if they hadnt found it in my right breast as the chance of reoccurance is high.   jacqui  ",
