      "Content": "Hi Mandy I am 9 months into treatment, zoladex & tamoxifen.  Im finding it very tough, flushes, lack of sleep and weight gain.  Get tearful too, and it does seem like its a on a rota.. Also, when I go for my injection,everytime,my GP always asks, so has your oncologist not decided to go for the 3month injection yet then?? Everytime I say, no, its not registered for breast cancer treatment and I only know this because the prev GP told me this and the one before that!!! I know its an expensive medication, but I would so rather not be having it done.  Sorry, that was my rant as Ive just been for one today and come out feeling really peed off that they keep going on about it!! I keep thinking that Im putting myself through this and in 2years time, my periods could return and I could be in the same boat and have gone through this rollercoaster for nothing.  At night I have a fan on constant and have done so for the past 8 months ... I can guarantee that I will be awake after 2hours sleep, downstairs for some water then back to toss and turn until my alarm goes off for work .... something tells me this cant be right.  On a good note, no periods, this is good for me as i did suffer!   Sorry that ive gone on a bit ,... that is my experience with both meds ... not good but something I think we just need to deal with!  take care xx  ",

      "Content": "Hi I had the same op as you in September, i didnt feel too bad afterwards and was home in the evening, I did find my arm hurt more than where the actual lump was removed.   I did feel in limbo until I received my results 2weeks later, I think this is the normal timescale.  I was initially told that I would more thank likely have chemo followed by R/T. but, as the cancer is estrogen-receptor positive it was decided the R/T and hormone treatment was for me.  I managed to work through the R/T, albeit very tired, and finished just before Christmas.  I have been on monthly injections of zoladex which will be for 2years and 5years of tamoxifen, which I must admit, side effects kicking in! Wishing you all the best ..... Let us know how you are getting on xxx :)",

Im so glad your scan is all clear.  It must be a worrying time for you, hope your WLI went okay today.  My lump was the same, grade 2 and ER&PR + but not HER2.  I cant give you advice on the chemo Im afraid as I didnt have to go through that, but Im sure there is lots of advice can be given on here.  Hormone treatment side effects are tough for me but slowly getting used to it!  You are brave and strong and its a journey with a rollercoaster ride!  But you will get there!  Take care xx",

With regards to driving for radio, yes mostly probably, my other half will come probably for first couple of sessions and friends have offered to take me but its a lot to expect anyone to do everyday for 3weeks! Thanks for your feedback, hope your keeping well! :) x",
