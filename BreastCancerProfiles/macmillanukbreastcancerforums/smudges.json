      "Content": "Has this happened to anyone, i went to the breast clinic for first time and had mamm and biopsy. Iwent back to the doctor and he said i had cancer that i was going to have to have 4 and a half Months of chemo and radio before he attempts to take my breast off. He gave me these results before my diopsy was back, my mum died of breast cancer and i thought i was going to die, i never told my sister or family, friends and had to leave ther and go and tell everyone, because of what we went through with mum, my sister thought the same as me. My biopsy came back dcis and after more test with a better surgeon and lymth testing, it was just in my right, i opted for double and reconstruction. Im 6 weeks pre op and recovering well, i just can't believe the stress they put me under for the 4 days waiting for diopsy to come back, i cryed for 4 days, the look on my sisters face will never leave me as well. Ive not had to have chemo or radio, just on tamoxifen for next 5 years.",
