      "Content": "Hi, I had my 2nd op to replace my saline implant with a silicone one in March and I'm still feeling quite uncomfortable , a bit like my breast is in a small vice in the mornings and like my bra feels too tight all the time. Has anyone else had a similar experience and can give me any indication on if this will last? thanks, Snowie.",

      "Content": "Hi Amanda, I've not had radiotheraphy but can suggest a few things for the hot sweats from the tamoxifen. I found evening primose oil worked for me but you need one that has high GLA content in it as that seems to work better. I also use a mixture of rose oil and clary sage oil. If you get rose oil with a base oil in it you can apply it straight to your skin then add the clary sage. If you put it on your pulse points on your wrists when the sweats start or beginning or end of the day. good luck",
