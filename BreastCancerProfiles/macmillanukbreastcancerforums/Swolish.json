      "Content": "Hi Chaza and all,  I just had lumpectomy and will need to have another op due too narrow margins. Then radiotherapy and hormone treatment due to my estrogen positive result.  I am reluctant to take hormone tablets for such a long time and wonder if I could avoid it?  Which ones have least se and if there is a alternative medicine possible to take instead?  Any comments and advice much appreciated. Happy Easter to you all! ",
