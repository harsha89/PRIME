      "Content": "It seems we all behave the same. I think waiting for the test results was worse than being told I had breast cancer and had to have chemo. I couldn't breathe I was panicking so much. My GP gave me some mild sleeping pills which really really helped and guess what as soon as I got my results I slept like a baby and didn't need them. I agree with mags panic attacks are about feeling loss of control. There's loads of help tho to get through this stage. My GP was great xxx",

      "Content": "Hi ladies, just wanted to say I did not have manuka honey during the first chemo and ended up with mouth ulcers which stopped me from talking but worse still it hurt to swallow (even rice pudding). Started taking 1 spoonful of manuka a day (15 strength) and since then touch wood I've had nothing. I can't say it helped my constipation which I've had for a couple of days after each chemo. I took 2 senokots each night for 2 nights and ate loads of fruit and that really helped compared to the pain from the first chemo. It really is a learning curve isn't it. I would say however, the best thing I've done so far is step up my water intake. Everyday I make sure I drink over a litre above my usual intake of tea coffee water etc etc and I have to say I have noticed a massive improvement to my life. For example I am not so tired ie hangover tired, and I feel healthier and more energetic.... Slow for cancer but energetic in comparison. I have also learnt to listen to my body. I stupidly Thought I could do it all.... Oh no... Don't risk your blood count girlies..... If your body tells you to rest.... Bloody we'll sit down, drink water and rest.... Don't fight it. It isn't worth losing a week. These are my best tips. Hair loss.... Yes awful, I'm bald but now I here in such great company I have to say that it wasn't as bad as I thought. In honesty I was more peed off about the mouth ulcer (I was very hungry)!!!!! Hair loss proves chemo is working and it will grow back we should all be celebrating xxx",

But it all went away thanks to magic remedying from the breast cancer nurses. I've not been sick and my wig is great. I have simply had to change things around. So if I'm a bit tired, I sit and do my nails. The best advice I could possibly give you is to drink drink loads of water, take water with u to chemo and start drinking as soon as they put it in and carry on. I truly believe this has helped me with any potential side effects. You don't need to keep the stuff in it only needs to bleach you then it can go so flush it out asap. All the very very best. Let us know how you get on. There's loads of help and advice here xxx",

On the 5th day I had to inject myself for 3 days to kick start my bone marrow. I hated the steroids. They have already given them to me to take for a couple of days before the first tax. I hope I can still take them all at once because sleep and water seem to be really controlling any side effects for me and more importantly keeping my blood count above 1.5 so can have my next chemo. Good luck with the fec you can ask me anything. Oh and it might be worth asking your bc nurse for one of their magic meds to deal with constipation. Not everyone gets it but I did and it was caused by the sickness tablets you have to take for 3 days after chemo along with the steroids. X",

It's a dreadful disease but just look at how well we are dealing with it. Yes....

      "Content": "Hi I had chemo 3fec and 3 tax then I had a double mastectomy (one breast was elective). I'm about to have radiotherapy. I was stage three lump in right breast and in one lymph node. I watched the chemo shrink the lumps and at the end they were tiny. I am on for a complete cure. I'm not saying its a walk in the park but I am saying don't be afraid. It doesn't matter what treatment plan you have, they are tailored to suit you. The good news is that when I have my breast construction they will use the fat from my belly to build my new boobies so I'm getting great tits and a tummy tuck to boot..... Hurrah!!!!!! the chemo is different for all of us, we all have different side effects but I would say this. Drink drink drink loads and loads of water. If you are on fec your wee will be bright red.  Aim to drink so much water that you turn your wee back to its normal colour the same day. I found this really reduced the side effects. The fec only has to bleach you, you don't have to keep it so wash it out as fast as you can. Secondly I bought manuka honey, highest strength I could buy 15plus and I had a spoonful everyday. I found it prevented mouth ulcers (and boy did I get them after the first chemo). I also invested in plastic cutlery and a plastic beaker. Daft as it sounds when everything tasted of cardboard tea tasted great in a plastic cup... I have no idea why but it really worked. Finally this didn't work for me but it did my cousin. Use waterproof mascara it prevents your eyelashes falling out.... Don't clean it off just keep putting it on. As I say this did not work for me but if it works for someone it's worth a shot..... Incidentally my cousin is through the other side. She's had reconstruction on a double mastectomy and her new boobies look great. She even had nipples tattooed and you couldn't tell the difference. It is truly amazing what the medical profession can do these days. i wish you lots of love, all the best, you will find loads of helpful advice here, someone somewhere has been through it, also I found no one minds if you have a rant...... So moan away!!!!!!!! Finally invest in a good sense of humour.... Step back from your illness and see the world as it really is.... I found this helped me through the tough times. Xxx",

Jolly painful, however, the oncologist was not at all concerned, they are all to do with my hair falling out and are simply trapped hair follicles I just need to keep an eye and ensure they don't burst and get infected. As it turns out all five lumps have gone down. This morning I woke with a small jelly-ish lump near the crease of my elbow and a dull ache in the elbow creases and the backs of my knees. Mentioned it in passing to the bc nurse after my usual blood tests. This turned out to be far more serious. Five vials of blood later it turns out I am a slightly higher risk than usual for blood clots..... Just goes to show that what you think is unimportant ie a dull ache can be far more serious than the five more painful lumps!!!! Just thought I'd mention it in case anyone else has a dull ache they haven't raised with their bc nurse..... Anyway am now sitting in bed because after they drained me of all my blood I felt knackered. Good fun all this bloomin chemo isn't it!!!!!!!!!",

I sat in a comfy armchair with lots of other people all at different stages with different cancers having chemo. Some we're laughing and joking, others kept themselves to themselves, reading, writing \"knitting\".....!!!! (Couldn't help it Emma - sorry ). Seriously, they put a drip in my arm (cannula) and fed the chemo through the drip and it didn't hurt. I played candy crush and read my book. You might want to check out the side effects. I had the shakes with steroids then mouth ulcers. some have sickness. But you can rest assured that we have all (between us) had any side effects that you might get so ask away. The best advice is to drink drink drink loads and loads of water. Your first wee will be bright red so drink as much as you can and flush the chemo out as quickly as possible turn it a lighter shade of pink or back to normal if you possibly can. The quicker you get it out the less side effects (my sister told me this, she is on chemo no 4). The chemo only needs to go in and bleach your insides, it doesn't need to stay. Take water with you and start drinking as soon as they put it in and carry on. All the best I'm having mine at 10am so I will be thinking about you Katie xxx",

Just started the second year when I got diagnosed so just doing the one module. It means I have an extra year of study. Not a problem in the grand scheme of things. I do it for enjoyment not for a career. I'm already qualified for my job but it is annoying that you can't do as much as you would like isn't it. I have however found a positive.... I read far more history books than I ever did before ie hour of chemo in bed etc etc so I expect to get a bloody good mark!!!!!! All the best xxx",

      "Content": "Hello everyone My name is Katie and I was advised by dreamthief to come to this site. I start my chemo on Tuesday and I am fortunate to have a potentially positive outcome. I also have a sister who was diagnosed 6 weeks before me who's outcome is not so positive. That being said she is the social butterfly...... currently camping with her mates as we speak...........(She is bless her NUTS)!!!!!! I wondered if any of you have some tips for me that I might experiment/pass on.   For example my sister tells me I should drink tons and tons of water after chemo to help prevent the mouth ulcers. My cousin (who is now in remission) told her to use waterproof mascara to prevent your eyelashes from falling out. TREAT ME AS A GUINEA PIG!!!!!!!!! I am a newby, lets test the water and see what happens..... Until Monday (My first Chemo is Tuesday). Please dump all of your advise under this discussion...... I have bought the waterproof mascara and I have loaded the fridge with bottled water......... Did anyone give you advice that you didn't take and wished you did????? I will let you know how I got on. Best of health everyone Katie XXX",

Anyway when Monika and lemon purple girl get back to us with the results of the yoga, I will take that up and lose my biskwit belly!!!!!!!!

Forewarned is forearmed even if we are only armed with a spoonful of manuka honey, a plastic beaker, waterproof mascara, nail polish and Ginger biskwits. Anyway, wish me luck I'm off to collect my wig today. I got one ordered to look as close to my normal hair as possible so as not to scare my five year old. (Although I did look pretty damn good in the brown long haired wig) ha ha never mind blonde mass of curls all over the place - here I come!!!!!!!!! Lots of love Katie Xxx",

      "Content": "Hi everyone. Sorry not to reply sooner but we moved house........ I know...... Mad isn't it. I didn't plan on getting breast cancer.... Talk about bad timing.... Anyway. I had the FEC T on 29th July and I took your advice and drank tons and tons of water, so much water that by the same evening my bright red wee was a lovely shade of pink...... If you do anything at all drink drink drink and flush that dreadful stuff out asap. It worked for me. The biggest problem I had was the three days of steroids following the chemo. I had to take three steroids plus two sickness tablets for three days afterwards. Talk about getting the shakes....... You name it I dropped it.... Cups plates..... I have now invested in a delightful range of plastic crockery!!!!!! I carried on shaking after the three days but I am now feeling ok. I have stuck to water although I'd love a glass of wine.... Ha ha. Devoured all fruit n veg, painted my toe and finger nails so they don't fall off and slathered my eyelashes in waterproof mascara. Not sure if that's a good idea though I got dry eye in one eye..... On the first night after chemo I sat in bed and ate a large packet of ginger biscuits (because I'm allowed - very nice too, although I admit I wasn't really feeling sick I just liked eating them). After the fifth day I had to have an injection for three days to encourage my bone marrow to produce more blood cells. I got the nurse to teach me how to do this myself. Quick painless stab in my biscuit filled belly and I'm done......the best bit is I'm now not waiting around for the nurse to turn up. So albeit a bit of control of my life with no interruptions. My husband has gone bonkers... Am I alright? do I need to go to bed?...... Nope I'm fine have now moved from ginger biscuits to foxes ginger crunches...(well...they are ginger). In short I'm doing ok. My hair is getting brittle, probably getting ready to fall out but I consider that a small price (although highly inconvenient) to pay if it gets rid of the cancer. So to all my fellow newbies et al. Touch wood (just touched head) I've been ok and I hope you all get the same or better. Ps keep the tips coming I promise to test them all Lots of love Katie Xxx",

I had a lovely cup of tea in a plastic beaker..... Metallic taste comes back afterwards but who cares.... Tea is tea and us Brits love tea!!!!!! Lots of love Katie X",
