      "Content": "Hi, I'm sorry you find yourself in this position again :( To answer your question - having a mastectomy will hopefully remove the cancer for you but on the pessimistic side, there is nothing to say that (as you don't want nodes checked, chemo or radio) that you couldn't have some cancerous cells are lurking and will embed themselves elsewhere.  Also, you could develop a new primary in the left breast. At the end of the day we all have to do what is right for us as individuals - and what is right for me is not necessarily right for you so bear that in mind when reading the following... Chemo can be crap (and it was for me) but it is manageable and in my view, is much better than the prospect of dying early from breast cancer.  Radiotherapy is considered to be a walk in the park after chemo (not had personally so can't really say). It all comes down to you - do you value your life more than your fear?  Only you can answer that. All the best,   Mia",

      "Content": "35 at a dx and I found once the main treatment rollercoaster was over that everything started to catch up with me - esepecially once I returned to the work environment as people assume that you're cured and life goes on as normal - well actually, it isn't that straightforward! I have had one-to-one counselling sessions with a cousellor who specialises in cancer patients (and intend to have some more) and have found them really helpful.  If you haven't already read it, I highly recommend Peter Harvey's article about when treatment finishes.",

      "Content": "Hi Anne, I've posted a full reply on your other thread.  In my case the reason I was offered bi-lateral mastecomy with immediate DIEP recon as a replacement for radiotherapy was because I do have the genetic mutation and therefore classed as high risk.  There are various factors involved in ascertaining your familial risk of breast cancer (inc. the age the others had cancer as well as types) so if you aren't rated high enough that may be why your PCT is not keen on funding the operation. Have you spoken with Wendy Watson at all?  She may be able to help advise you on how to get your PCT to fund the operation. Just a note regarding being offered a DIEP - just because you are offered it does not necessarily mean that is what you get.  It depends upon the availability of good blood vessels in your abdomen.  In my case they were able to do a SIEA on the left (no muscle used) but on the right they had to go into muscle so the DIEP became a MS2-TRAM.  I had given permission that if on the operating table the tummy was completely a no go area that they could take from the back (although this wasn't what I wanted in an ideal situation). All the best for you with your remaining treatment, Mia",

      "Content": "To Tina: Really sorry you're going through the mill right now.  Hope that your results come back quickly so that you don't have to spend any more time than necessary worrying about what they could be.  I'm afraid I can't offer any advice really,- just some virtual hugs.  Keep us posted on progress.   To Kaz: Triple Negative (TN) is a term used to describe a cancer that is not oestrogeon or progesterone or HER2 positive, i.e. (ER- PR- HER2-).  Unfortunately there are no targeted therapies available at the moment to help treat a triple negative cancer which means that once we've exhausted surgery, chemo and radiotherapy - there's nothing else the clinicians can do for us.   To Sarah: There is evidence that suggests a link between genetic cancer and triple negative status.  The fact that I was Triple Negative was actually one of the indicators (together with age of onset, grade 3, family history) that led them to believe I would come back as BRCA1 positive (and they were right).",

      "Content": "Hi Anne, I'm a little late to your thread in terms of giving you information before your appointment as I literally just got out of hospital yesterday afternoon after bi-lateral mastectomies with immediate recon.  The plan was to have a DIEP but the blood vessels didn't look great on the CT scan and when they got inside me they ended up doing a SIEA flap (Superficial Inferior Epigastric Artery Flap) on the left and a muscle-sparing free transverse rectus abdominis musculocutaneous (MS-2 TRAM flap) on the right (both free flaps like the DIEP, just technical differences - the key thing from patient perspective being that the use of some muscle on the right means a longer recovery time). I live in West Sussex and had my operation performed by a team of surgeons under Mr Boorman at the Queen Victoria Hospital in East Grinsted; they have a great reputation and thus far I am very pleased with the results. Regarding timescales, in my case the key dates are as follows: 13th February 2010 - Found lump, aged 35 31st March 2010 - offical diagnosis date after 2 core biopsies hence the wait.  Grade 3 Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (15mm), Triple negative (ER- PR- HER2-), 26th April 2010 - Lumpectomy & SNB (sentinel node biopsy).  Results were optimistic stage 1 (T1c-N0-M0) 3rd June until 6th October 2010 6 cycles of chemotherapy (FEC-T) During chemo got the results back regarding my genetic test which confirmed I have BRCA1(4327C>T).  My oncologist recommended going ahead with a bi-lateral mastecomy and immediate recon rather than radiotherapy for the next stage of treatment. 8th November 2010 - admitted to hospital for the op 9th November 2010 - op carried out by team of surgeons faster than expected (was expecting 10 hours and they did it in 8) 10th Nov - day 1 post op, physio got me out of bed into a chair during the afternoon for a few hours 11th Nov - day 2 post op, catheter removed; able to get in and out of bed and walk a bit with aid, came off the patient controlled analgesic (morphine) 12th Nov - day 3 post op, 3/4 drains removed; able to get in and out of bed unaided for the most part and walking better.  Also sit-down shower with help from nurse which was bliss as I felt so dirty 13th Nov - day 4 post op, final drain (left abdomen) removed and allowed home a day ahead of schedule with just paracetomol and ibuprofen :) I wasn't looking forward to a hospital stay (had been told to expect a minimum of 7 days) but the nurses and other patients were great which made it a much more bearable experience.  I also took my laptop with mobile broadband which helped for virtual visits over skype :) That's the story on this op so far, if you have any specific questions feel free to ask me and I'll do my best to answer.  I know for me that I have done absolutely the right thing and it brings such a level of peace of mind knowing I've done all I can do to prevent myself from getting breast cancer and having to go through the treatment again.  In 2011 we deal with the ovaries :)",
