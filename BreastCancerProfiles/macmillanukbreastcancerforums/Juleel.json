Don\u2019t know when my radiotherapy will start from this seem to be backwards and forwards to hospital. Not gone back to work yet was hoping to have had my 3 weeks of radiotherapy before I went back. Not sure this is going to be the case now as everything taking forever. Just want to get back to some normality. Good days and bad days. Take care xxx Julie xx",
