    "Content": "Hi everyone, I had a mastacormy in sept and finished radiotherapy just before xmas. It is like being on a roller coaster. My life was accually great considering what I'd been thro. But the crying all the time and felling very low has set in big time. I went to talk to my bc nurse who was great but can't be there 24/7, she's sending me to counciall, but does anyone know of any support groups in South Yorkshire area where ladies meet up. I was hoping to go back to work January but don't know if I can face it xx",
