The pattern soon formed that after treatment on Monday, I would wake up with a sore throat on Tuesday morning. Thursday afternoon brought loss of appetite and joint pain. This lasted until day 10 when I would start to feel human again.  I must admit that although I had anti-sickness tablets, I didn't take them and was never sick. Make sure you avoid anyone with an infection and if your temp goes above 38, call your team immediately. I found sponge puddings with custard to be the best I could eat...get a stock in! x Bon p.s. If you need any further info, I'll dig out the diary :) ",

One thing it has caused is Osteonecrosis in my upper right jaw, it's rare but after being referred to a Maxillo-Facial Consultant, I am on permanent anti-biotics and all seems under control now. Make sure that your dental hygiene routine is at full max and that your dentist is aware that you are on Bisphosphonates.  I'm with Carolyn on the temperature..anything over 38 needs attention, call your BC team straight away as it may be a marker for infection. (I've had 2 nasty ones in the last 6 weeks that have resulted in being admitted and endless days on a drip). Sorry, I can't be of more help. x Bon",

This doesn't give me any problem and should fall away in due course. The good news is that permanent anti biotics have stabilised the problem and when I had to have another tooth out a few months after, there were no problems at all. Please don't over think it, the condition is still very rare but it is important that while on Bisphosphonates you take extra care with your dental hygiene. I use Corsodyl toothpaste and mouthwash along with interdental brushes at least twice a day and make sure I see my Dentist every 3 months. Hope this helps, x Bon",

You'll be fine in a while. It's marvellous what they can do'. I didn't have the time (or the patience) to explain that I am not going to be cured, I have survived my initial 6 month prognosis because of good palliative care and largely ignoring the sword of Damocles dangling over me. SBC is the invisible, poor relation in the cancer family and needs publicity and research. We do not want sympathy just a share in the shouting.    ",

She and many, many others have a pink feather boa view of breast cancer that is promoted by charity fundraisers and in my view, trivialises and sentimentalises a very serious issue. All the publicity tells us that we are more likely to survive breast cancer than not but there is no mention of SBC. Maybe it's only happy endings that encourage people to donate. I don't think I've seen the video in question but will definitely have a dig around for it now. Please don't take this as bitterness, I am probably happier now than I've ever been, my concern is that without awareness of SBC, no real research will be funded and many more people will have to face their mortality sooner than expected. ",
