      "Content": "Hi all Yesterday I received my 7th and final chemo, picc line removed, can\u2019t expkain the relief of getting through this first phase. Having followed your journeys I realise how lucky I have been, no stay overs in hospital, only one chemo cancelled due to sore throat, not saying it\u2019s nern easy but I think I\u2019ve been lucky. Four weeks respite now before my mastectomy which I\u2019m hoping will be easier than the last 22 weeks. Wishing you all well Love Tracy x",

      "Content": "Hi all Hope I am now posting in the April chemo thread, don\u2019t know why I struggle must be my chemo brain. So on Sunday I was not halfway through my first part of my breast cancer journey but yesterday had my forth of 7 so 4 down three to go. What a hideous day, up at 6; on bus at 7..30, arrived at bhoc at 8.55, new picc line inserted, started an hour and a half infusion of herceptin, 15 minute flush, two hour break to unsure no reaction, an hour of Pertuzumab, new drug funded by the drugs council, 15 minute flush, then hour of T followed by 15 minute flush left oncology at 5.35 arrived home at 7pm, emotionally and physically exhausted. Thankfully no reactions so three weeks from now should only be 4.5 hrs of infusion.  Having read all your comments I am now awaiting the hideous side effects these poisons bring.  Today I have to ring southmead to inform them I\u2019m four down so they can book in my mastectomy, how long after your final chemos did you have to wait for surgery.? You are all so inspiring and positive in your responses and for that I thank you ❤️",

      "Content": "Hi had my round 4 last Monday and found the side effects much worse than the Fec but I guess with the two targetting agents alongside I should\u2019ve expected it. Like you I\u2019m having my op after 7 rounds of chemo. I can physically feel the lump has shrunk but having mri Monday to see if the chemo has done its stuff.  Oh the joys hope it continues to not effect you too bad xxx",
