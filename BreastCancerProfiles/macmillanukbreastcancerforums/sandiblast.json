    "Content": "I was told the same thing. Had my tumor removed in May and for quite awhile it looked fine. Then all of a sudden the stitch line sunk in, around my nipple sunk too. I did ask and was told that it would more than like stay like that. I wonder if once all the treatments are over is I am able to have it fixed. From the way the oncologist felt, I don't think so. I am now half way through my chemo, then 6! weeks of radiation. Seems like an awful lot. Gets me down a lot. Waiting for results from MRI. That is driving me crazy. Will not know for 5 more days. Also, when people see me they think I am going to be thin now, the opposite. Gained so much in 3 months.",
