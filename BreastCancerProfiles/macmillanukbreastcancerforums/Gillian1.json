      "Content": "Hi all   The one good thing about losing all your body hair is that you don't need to shave legs etc. I too wore scarves and hats and felt comfortable. I never got a wig. Has anyone else found that when the hair grew back it was finer than before - most people I have met say it comes back thicker and curly I am still wearing the hats because I actually like them rather than that I have to.  ",

      "Content": "We all worry about any aches and pains and the worry can get out of proportion when it is not linked to the cancer at all. I would ring the breast cancer nurse again. That is what she is there for and she may be able to refer you back to the consultant again Take control of the situation and get refered and then you will not worry so much.",
