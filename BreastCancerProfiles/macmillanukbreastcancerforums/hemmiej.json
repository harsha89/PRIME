      "Content": "Hi Wendy I had my lumpectomy and snb on 11th October i had to wait two weeks for the results which were clear but grade 3 so then had to wait for Chemo which started on 7th December. I found that the waiting is the worst part (apart from the side effects - i must be one of the 20%).Â  I was told that the delay for treatment would not have any effect . Hope all goes well for you Julie x",
