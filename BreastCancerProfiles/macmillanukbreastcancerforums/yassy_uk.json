    "Content": "Sorry to hear about your nan. When I was diagnosed there was no breast care nurse there and I wasn't told about them until I went for my second biopsy and was told to phone my breast care nurse, when I informed them I didn't have one they were disgusted with my surgeon. I then had a mastectomy and recon 5 weeks ago and since then have only seen the breast care nurse once, when the doc was giving me my results. At the moment I feel very let down with the service I have received from my breast care nurses and breast unit and feel very alone. Thank god for the Internet. I was in hospital from the wednesday when I had the surgery till the Sunday. But got the feeling from the thurs that they wanted me to go home, but I kept saying no. The nurses on the ward even tolde to throw away the magnet for my implant as they didn't know what it was for and thought it was for my drain, it just makes you wonder. Good luck to your nan, I hope she starts getting more support, maybe try the GP and get his support. Lisa",
