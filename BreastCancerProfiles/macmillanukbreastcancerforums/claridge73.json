    "Content": "Hi i had mastectomy with Diep reconstruction in Sept so im about 8 weeks on, at the Royal Free London. It is a big op but i was looked after v well. I had a few minor problems as i got an infection in the drain site after a week and my belly button has only just healed.  But the new boob is fantastic. It is so like my other one im quite amazed. For me the decision came down to not wanting other ops after this one. Iwas told i did the right thing because i need radiotherapy and the new boob will restand this much better than an implant.  Its a big op and my tummy is still v tight. I have only been walking uprigt for 2 weeks and the tightness and long recovery has got to me. But now im through  the worst i can see light at the end of the tunnel! Just have 5 more chemos to go now! Good luck. I know an implant is the easier route but potentially does come with a lot more problems. Thats what i was told anyway! Claire",
