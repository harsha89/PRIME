      "Content": "hi everyone, i have read all your posts with interest.i am so glad most people seem to feel pretty normal with their chemo.i feel like i am going to die.i have never felt so sick in all my life.i am on 3 fec /3 taxtere.currently having just had my 2nd fec. i feel so sick from the minute i have the chemo and can't eat for the first 4 days, then maybe a little soup or an ice lolly.i am on a lot of anti sickness pills,not sure if they work or not, because i still feel bad, although my sense of smell isn't so acute,thank goodness.last time i just started feeling a bit better,a few days before my next session.i don't know if i would have agreed to chemo if i had known it would be so bad.i don't know what to do for the best.carol.x",
