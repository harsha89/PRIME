      "Content": "Hi Sharon I still have some slight numbness on my chest and on my armpit. This does vary from day to day. Its not really where the breast was that feels numb for me but the chest area above and towards the armpit. Some days my armpit feels tender, but when I examine it there are no lumps and its not sore to the touch. My oncloogist gave it a good going over the other week and it did feel odd for a few days afterwards. I was able to wash the wound and armpit gently with a face cloth from the start (after the sterristrips came off). I am able to use antiperspirant and I shave my armpits using a venus ladies razor the ones with the sopapy stuff on the blade head. On the other hand my friend Tracy still can't bear to touch her armpit as she feels sick when she does, and its over 2 years for her.Don't worry about  getting upset over \"the trivial\" stuff. Out of everything I cried the most over loosing my hair, I wept buckets. I hated the wig and did not cope at all well with bing bald. Don't be frightened to ask any other questions you might have.Take Care JoanX  ",

Its ok to be scared. As you can see from all the lovely messages you have got on here there are loads of people rooting for you. Please listen carefully to your consultant tomorrow. He/she will not rush you and will be happy to answer any questions you have. I'm confident you will make the right choice, it just having so long to mull it over can make you blow thing up in your mind. As for the depression speak to you GP, ask for a referral to a Community Psychiatric Nurse CPN or other counselling services to give you some additional support over the next few months. I've never used Macmillan nurses myself but wonder whether they  offer some supportive counselling service? With the ME, I don't know much about that (but know that it can cause extreme fatigue and discomfort), but you will still need to put your feet up for a snooze in the afternoons after the op anyway for a few weeks. Please try not to be so hard on yourself. I've resisted telling you to have the mastecomy so far in my posts. However, I hope you decide that you will. Please Look after yourself. Joan",

      "Content": "Hi Sharon I think you have quite a bit of soul searching to do in the next few days, and its not a decision that you will take lightly. I agree with the comments given by everyone else on here. I would reassure you that the mastectomy was the least difficult part of the treatment for me. Yes I was petrified that I might die in the operating theatre, but I had never been in hospital before so didn't know what to expect.. Now having been through the experience it is one less thing I will worry about in the future. To be true I would rather not have had to have a mastectomy, but then I would not have chosen to have cancer. Unlike you I was given three options WLExcision, Therapeutic mamoplasty on both sides or the mastecomy. I was so frightenened that the first two options would not totally get rid of the cancer that I chose the mastecomy, on reflection I still think it was the right decision for me. I felt really well after the op, and was back to my normal activity level within 2-3 weeks. I was allowed to shower with the dressing on 2 days after the op. I also was encouraged by my district nurse to remove the steristrips myself in the shower after about 12 days. It was a little bit scary, but it certainly got me and my husband over the first hurdle of having to look at the scar, (he helped me remove them).  I did follow the advice of the phisio and did the exercises religiously to good effect. I do admit to being naughty with the wet razor but am extremely careful with it. My friend Tracy wasn't too bothered about the scar, and would show it to anyone who asked....she's a bit forward like that, it was the sensations she felt in her armpit that bothered her. You know Sharon its ok to be frightened by this thing, just keep talking and make a list of questions to take with you on Friday. Take care best wishes Joan  ",

May be it would be prudent to squeeze a visit in to your GP before you go into hospital to discuss your feeling/concerns re the ME and depression and how you might cope with them after the op. Don't froget to spoil yourself a bit, this next week,  like the advert says 'cos you deserve it!! Please keep in touch this week if you want too. You can personal message me if you dont want to post it on a forum. Glad you made the decision to have the mastectomy. Take care sending you hugs ((((o)))) Joan",

      "Content": "Hi Sharon My word Sharon just how organised are you? so much better prepared than I was!!. I came around from surgery and when I got back to the ward I asked the nurse to phone my husband and tell him not to come in, 'cos I could not be bothered with visitors. As it happens he was already on his way so he did come to see me. I'm really glad he did because when he left me the day before we were both really upset. Seeing me, reassured him that I was ok. I also found I could be bothered. Somehow my poor husband got swept up with everything, he seemed to get lost in everything that was going on. he now feels there was very limited support for spouses/partners. I think like your husband he was quite down for a while. He tried very hard to look after me when I came out of hospital, he even tried getting me to go to bed at 6.30pm. This was in the August so it was still broad day light. Honestly I felt so well after the op that I was able to go to the golf club for a glass of pop with him on the Sunday (had the op on the wed) . Had my drains in a little cloth bag. Not long now for you take care. Love Joan",

I was second on the list so had to wait till after 11am to go to theatre. I think like you, if I hadn't have had anything to help me I might have given Linford Christie a good run for his money. Imagine me in one of those gowns open down the back with my great big bum, in those awful paper knickers running through the hospital...... not a pretty sight. Seriously, they are used to people being anxious so do not be afraid to ask for something to ease the stress and the wait. Anyway thats another day over, you are doing so well keep your. chin up, you made the right decision. People wont treat you differently if you don't allow them to. I asked all of my friends to be prepared for a quick update each time we met and then I wanted to talk about every day things 'cos \"there is more to me than bloody breast cancer!\" (sorry for the expletive.) Like someone else said I focused on hating the cancer, and just wanted it completely out of my body. Have you seen your GP yet? or are you too busy sorting things out? Take care Joan",
