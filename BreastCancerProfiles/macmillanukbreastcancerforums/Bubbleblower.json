Boo. But it could have been so much worse so I am counting my blessings. Do any of you know anything about a trial that I may be offered access to called the OLYMPUS trial. My surgeon said it could be significantly beneficial to me because I have the HER2 Negative so NO Herceptine etc would help. Thanks everyone, onward and upward. Oncologist in two weeks. Anyone able to tell me how much longer after that it may be before chemo starts? Dinner now methinks Hugs one and all xxxxx",

However I have tnbc and was offered the chance had my test been positive to go on a new drug trial that my oncologist had told me could be of substantial benefit to me. So guiltily I felt torn. I wanted to have the opportunity to try a drug that could be instrumental in preventing re-occurance but I desperately did not want to pass on the dreaded gene to my wonderful children and grandchildren. On balance I am so glad that it was negative. We all have our own reasons for taking this test and NO ONE has a right to judge you until they have walked in your shoes. Tell the Naysayers to get lost and enjoy the positivity and support of the new friends you will find on this fabulous site. Hugs xx",

      "Content": "Hi there Mlanders. I'm exactly where you are, waiting for results on Friday too. I have been coming on here since the day I was diagnosed (7-4-15) so oh boy do I feel ready to hear those results. Everyone without exception has said that the waiting is the worst part and once they know what the plan is it seems that you settle into  a new kind of normal.... a kind of stable routine, at least for a few months. The support of the people on this forum has been a lifesaver for me. They have never laughed at my daft questions (evidently there is no such thing as a daft question!) just given me straightforward sensible and honest advice.  I have been informed ,nurtured, entertained and generally kept sane by people that really understand what we are experiencing. Best advice so far.....Don't Google...use baby wipes under arms......take the painkillers BEFORE you need them......Do the exercises in the book, have at least three laughs a day:-) Please stay in touch so we can compare notes, Hugs to you xx",

      "Content": "As with you Mlanders  I have to have the 15 Rads Also I have been well prepared by my BCN for the likely news that I may need Chemo and Herceptine. I have been reading some of the back threads about what helps and what doesn't help.... and the tips are invaluable. Stuff like  \"use plastic cutlery \"cos it stops the metallic taste in the food\" and you may not feel half as wiped out by Rads as you may be expecting. I have a burning pain at the back of my armpit which is a real  So & So as well as all the normal numbness where the nerves were damaged and the soreness and bruising that comes with any surgery trauma. (Yep.. I've had a lot of ops over the years!) I am sticking to the excercises though because I can hardly move my arm first thing in the morning but it gets easier throughout the day. What about you.....any of this sounding familiar? Stroll on Friday eh!  Heres hoping for better than expected news. Hugs x",
