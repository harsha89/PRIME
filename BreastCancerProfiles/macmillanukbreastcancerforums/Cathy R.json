When I have meetings at work to discuss my time off and see my colleagues they comment on how well I look, but it is so difficult explain the fatigue, joint pains and sleepless nights. If any have seen VDs first blog they will think I've been on holiday.

      "Content": "Hi Suzie Just noticed your post and would like to pass on my own tips on dealing with chemo. During the 48 hours prior to treatment don't eat fatty food and drink lots of water so your body can flush things through quickly Drink water all the time Buy a child's toothbrush and rinse under warm water to protect gums and mouth Have lots of tins of soup or baked beans in cupboard. No matter how bad you feel you have to eat something. I would heat up a teacup of beans and eat one a time with teaspoon. You do feel better with something inside you. Eat well. It keeps your bloods up and you will feel better as a result. Chemo wardrobe. Leggings and floppy t-shirts  Do as much as you can yourself. You will feel better but ask for help when you need it.

I tend to be a candy floss pink ( to which everyone comments on how rosy my cheeks look) a lot of the time. Its a conversation stopper to anyone I am talking to. They just seem to stare at me wondering what is going on. I look like a menopausal woman having a panic attack. I wanted to move on and the group I worked amongst were aware and carried on as normal when I flush. I may have to return to work with an elbow crutch due to the letrozole side effects and existing arthritis. I am feeling self conscious and vulnerable. I am moving to a dept that has a high staff turnover. There is nothing on my CV similar to the role I am being placed in. In truth I am feeling cast aside and regretting my decision to return under these circumstances, Cathy",

However I have been advised that I am to move to a new dept into a call centre type role. My previous role was as an analyst of documents and whilst responsible and quiet autonomous role. I will be working close to my old dept but not with them. The women who I used to work with are aware of my treatments and the difficult side effects of my letrozole. I based my decision to return to work based on the role I thoroughly enjoyed and support of the women around me.  I have gone into meltdown panicking. I don't know the role or people surrounding me. The old team have been good as gold about keeping their distance when they have colds etc and reassuring me they will look after me.The new team will just know I've had cancer but now I am back. I won't even be having lunch with my former colleagues. How do I explain letrozole side effect to a 20ish year old man when I flush. I can't sleep so tiredness is increasing the flushes and aches and pains. I am distraught. Please does anyone have some advice. Thank you Cathy ",

We feel awful and any stress makes it worse. Having to juggle a home is stressful enough even if it is only the voices in your head listing all the things that  need doing. I'm afraid as the song says \"Let it go\" you need to keep your strength up. As Dreamthief says there are times when you can get out a bit and take advantage of it and make plans with people who will look after you and understand if any plans go pearshape. I am through my chemo now but remember being able to do enough to not feel frustrated. However hand over the smaller things to someone else if you can. ( Even shopping on line will save you from the tall sweaty man coughing all over me in a supermarket queue - you can't escape when all your stuff is on the belt and caught in the queue.) I went blue trying not to breathe in! Enjoy what you can in the meantime. It will make you laugh when you look back on your own coping strategies later. Good luck and of course BIG HUG. Cathy",

Couldn't get away. We was coughing and huffing a puffing behind me. I could feel his breath on me! All I could do was put my head down away from him and put my hood up on jacket. Wiped my face and hands with gel as soon as I could. Fingers crossed. But what a idiot.  Ali Good luck with needle phobia. Remember to try and relax. Shake out your arms to release tension, do some jumping jacks if you can. Nurses won't mind and humour breaks tension. Another tip is as they are doing anything you don't like count to 10 and wriggle your toes. The needles are very sharp(sorry) and if you can relax it really won't hurt. I used to be terrified and something happened many years ago when I needed lots of needles. A nurse helped with this technique and I am fine now but remember what it feels like. Cathy",

If the result is the worst it can be you are about to be very busy. Don't waste the time whilst you waiting.Get busy.  Do stuff anything, feed ducks, have nights out anything but don't brood.

But always keep some internal batteries to keep you going. Remember when you went out as a teenager but had to keep the bus fare to get home!  I am 3 & half year since chemo but had to continue with herceptin until November 2015. I worked hard to maintain my blood results so that chemo could go ahead on time through a rich iron diet. It will also help with any fatigue. There isnt much you can control throughout this process but doing as you are told is a good start. At least if there is a problem you can say you have done your best. EG doing you physio and did I mention DRINK WATER. I used to fill up on water and avoid fatty food for the 2 days prior to treatment so your liver can flush everything through quicker. I had a chemo wardrobe leggings etc. Get out of bed in the morning, get dressed then rest on sofa if needed. I set myself a 9.00 deadline to get up.  Join a support group through hospital if there is one. I truely believe this helped me. We had Xmas Do, coffee mornings etc. gets you out with like minded people as sometime \"outsiders\" just wont get it!  This is not normal, dont expect life to be normal for the next few months I'm afraid but dont just wait for it to be over. Live through it as best you can. Biggest hug.  By the way did I mention DRINK WATER!!!!! Cathy",

      "Content": "Hi  Saw your post and had to reply. your first chemo is tricky. Not only are you having chemo but you are still dealing the shock of diagnosis. You will never feel the way you do at your first chemo again because of all the unknowns that you have been through. Now I am not saying it is easy from here but now you know the team and they will know you. Without the fear of the first time you will feel more in control. Remember your first driving lesson - you thought you would never master it.  Look after yourself - never before have you have licence to treat yourself well. You and getting through this is your new priority! Prepare yourself for the next session but dont dwell on it. Make yourself comfortable. You have to take care of yourself. It is important to eat and drink lots of water to flush the treatment through. My secret was tins of beans. No matter how rough eat something. Put half tin of beans in mug, microwave and eat with a spoon. This is simple way of looking after yourself and you feel better if you can control something in the chaos.  Plan to do things during your well week. Shop on line (supermarkets are full of sneezing /coughing people). Watch films, read books. As I say unfortunately you are where you are and will have to continue. Speak to counsellors, get all the advice and imfo you want. We are here to help. Do whatever it takes to make this comfortable for you. The more I did for myself the more it helped as I knew at least I was trying.  Good luck  Big hug Cathy xxxx",
