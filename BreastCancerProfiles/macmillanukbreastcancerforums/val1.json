    "Content": "I had my first Taxotere on monday and so far....not too bad. I actually managed a swim yesterday something I could never have done on FEC due to the fatigue. I am noticing aches and pains though but these are not so bad. The worst thing is this awful taste in my mouth. I am a complete chocoholic usually but I cant even look at it! Everything tastes awful. The only thing I get pleasure from is pickled onion flavoured crisps! Any tips for this...?",
