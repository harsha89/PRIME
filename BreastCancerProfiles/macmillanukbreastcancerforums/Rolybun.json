      "Content": "Hello everyone  I've just joined, 5his evening.  I had a mastectomy plus reduction last Tuesday.  My partner (she's been v supportive but unfortunately lives abroad)   flew back to work today, not sure when we'll next see each other.  I'm  pretty tearful now that she's gone and have been more emotional anyway since taking letrozole.  I'd like to ask about wearing a bra.  Before the mastectomy i always  took  bras off soon as i got home but have been advised to wear post operative bras 24/7 but they're  not very comfortable.  Does anyone have any advice? Thanks",
