      "Content": "I am so glad I came across this post as I have been wondering whether to ask for a copy of my pathology reports (both from the initial biopsies which diagnosed cancer and also from the surgery).  I never feel confident enough to ask or question anything whilst I am facing a member of the team but afterwards I always wish I has asked more questions.  I did pluck up the courage to ask the bc nurse what size was my tumour as a friend on facebook mentioned hers was 5.5mm.  It turned out mine was 19mm even though it was always referred to as tiny.   Also at my followup visit 2 weeks after sugery I was told the news was good in that they had 'got it all' from my breast, my lymph nodes also clear so only need 3 weeks of rads.  I took this to mean that the margin of healthy tissue around the tumour was clear but at my first visit to the Oncologist, she told me that I would need an extra week of rads due to the cancer cells being right to the margin.  Now I have spent the weekend worrying about whether I should have been offered further surgery or not as another friend who did not have clear margins had to go back for a wider excision to get a clear margin before starting rads.  I will hopefully speak to the bc nurse tomorrow as I want to clarify things.  And I will definitely be asking for a copy of my pathology reports. I would add that I feel so grateful for all that is being done for me and feel a bit of a moaning minnie, but I also feel that mistakes are made and it is our lives we are dealing with at the end of the day. Sorry for the essay!",

I will let you know how I get on with the bc nurse, I tried to get an appt. with my gp this morning to ask for a copy of my path report but as usual it is emergencies only.  Speak soon, hope you had a good Mother's Day x",

Also reading Dreamtheif's post, it made my cry.  I think all women want a husband/partner like you, I agree with Jenny that Jackie is a very lucky lady. ",

      "Content": "Hi everyone I finished my radiotherapy on 13th May and started Tamoxifen on 25th May.  I have felt pretty good up til now, the 4th week of rads was the worst as targeted at the tumour site rather than the whole breast and caused sunburn like symptoms.  But this if finally starting to feel better now, have been putting lots of E45 cream on several times a day. My problem now is feeling oh so terribly tired, aching all over, and so cold (in between the hot flushes from coming off hrt in Jan).  All I want to do is put my electric blanket on and crawl back into bed.  But even several extra hours sleep does not make me feel any better.  When I am up, reading is like too much trouble.  This is not like me, I am so active and fit usually, walking every day.  Now I am dragging myself around the house like a 90 year old! I am guessing the radiotherapy would cause the tiredness but I would appreciate any feedback from you lovely ladies on how you felt post treatment.  I would guess that the Tamoxifen hasn't really had time to start giving me side effects after just a few days.   Maybe I just have a bug. Hugs to all",

I guess I just want to say I feel for you and like all your friends on this site, will be with you every step of the way. Every time I read a post like yours, I light a candle (well tealight) in my room and put my hands together.  I am going to do this right now. Huge hugs OOOOOOOOOOO  ",

      "Content": "Hi, I wonder has anyone else been told the same as me - that they would need an extra boost of radiation due to margins around tumour not being clear (i.e. cancer cells to edge of margin).  When I asked the Oncologist about this she said that the edge where the cells were was the edge which was closest to the chest wall so further surgery wasn't an option as they don't want to start cutting into the chest wall.  I can understand this but wondered how common it is.  And apparently, the final week of rads is different to the first 3 in that it is directed right to the area where the tumour was as opposed to the whole breast. I would be interested in hearing if anyone else has experienced this. ",
