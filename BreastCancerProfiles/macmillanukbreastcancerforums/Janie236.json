      "Content": "Hi jojo I have 2 sons 23 & 25. My 25 year found it really hard hearing that I had breast cancer he looked up on google worst thing he could of done. He read all the wrong stuff. He kept on about not wanting to be without his mum. We sat down and I let him read the letters I had received from the hospital and all the info that had been given to me. It helped a bit. When he started telling his friends he got a lot of replies about how some of them had been through the same thing with family members. It has been a rough time for him but I think he is finally understanding.  Jane x",

      "Content": "Hi cocopops I have just finished 12 weeks of weekly paclitaxel. I used the cold cap and didn't lose my hair. I found I started to suffer after the 3 rd week. I did suffer with sickness and diarrhoea. I had nose bleeds and stomach pains. I had chemo on Thursday so usually my weekends were the worse days for me. By Tuesday I started to feel normal then on Thursday it all started again. I have been given my operation date in march which I'm quite nervous about. My lump had nearly disappeared so I know the operation isn't as bad as it could of been. I also have to have 3 weekly herceptin which I found stings like hell. I hope this helps as I felt like you when it started I kept thinking when will I be ill.  Janie xx",
