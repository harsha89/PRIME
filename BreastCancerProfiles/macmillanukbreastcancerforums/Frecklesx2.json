      "Content": "HI NOJ, Firstly what an amazing attitude you have..... you are inspirational and just the pick me up i needed today.... I have an 8 year old son who i decided to tell about my brain tumour as i was told iwas to have a craniotomy spend 10 days in hospital 3 months at home recovering and id b ok. He had lost his Dad my ex husband the previous year to suicide. I had got so sick i could get out of bed, so i had no way of really hiding the fact that i was sick. I told him exactly what the Surgeon told me so he new it would be tough for a while and that Nan and Pop would come live with us but we would be right. Things back fired on me, all the tumour couldn't be removed. i spent 4 weeks in hospital rehab learning to walk shower eat again etc, and am now on my eighth cycle of chemo thats not working and awaiting a call about having Gamma Knife Radiation. Times are tough i still cannot work , drive have trouble with balance coordination speech and eating but we make the most of a really shit situation.. He has shown amazing resillience but has grown up way to fast and feels pressured to look after me, we have some very in depth conversations and he asks some questions that rip at my heart but i have no regrets in being totally honest with him.. I like you hope that i will not die from this, but just in case i do i need my little man to be prepared. Only you know what is the best thing for your family in your situation and with the attitude you are displaying i'm sure you'll come along way. All the very best for your journey. please remember to look after you and your feelings also!!!!! We all have terrible days where that positiveness just dissapears and it's scary... (((((((((((((HUGS))))))))))))))))))) Freckles xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
