I am also new to this and just last week found out I have breast cancer, I am 26 with a young baby girl too, this came as such a shock. My first chemo is this friday and i am really scared and dont know what to expect, so I was reading posts for advice and reassurance and yours stood out to me because of your age. I never thought at 26 I would be diagnosed with breast cancer. If u dont mind me asking, how did u find yiur first chemo session and what is the cold cap like? Any help or advice would be appreciated, :-) Thanks x",

It is going to be hard but like u said we just need to get on with it and be strong!! It sounds like ur first chemo went really well (as well as can be in this situation) hardly any side effects is really good. Ive got my pre assessment tomorrow for the chemo and im going to ask about the cold cap. I would like to give it ago, its wortha try I suppose, I was told it works on some people and not others so ill have to see. Are u having your chemo every 3 weeks? Im not sure what type im having yet, I think it might bethe same as u, but I will find out tomorrow im sure.  X x",
