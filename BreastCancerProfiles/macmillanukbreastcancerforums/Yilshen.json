      "Content": "Hi Kim Yes I had it, they do it by lying you down on bed, and numb your arm by mm and slide in the tube no pain or anything then you have an X-ray to see if its ok then that's it. Every time you have blood test or chemo they do it from there its so easy.  oh having a shower could be a bit difficult as you mustn't get it wet.  You better buy cling film  to wrap round your arm then take it off when you finish your shower. Good luck Yilshen",

      "Content": "Hi Jenny I have just read your post and it sounds so sad but I had the same problem with my oncology when I visited her on Wednesday.  I said I was in so much pain she said you can stop taking what you taking.  I said breast cancer runs in my family I don't want it returning back and she was so cold she just couldn't care, I don't know why she is in this field if she don't want to see people like us. Lets hope next time when I visit I get better oncologist.  Do you get the same person as I see different one every time I visit. Take care Yilshen",
