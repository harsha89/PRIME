    "Content": "I am also triple negative having found out yesterday so its good to see your posts although I dont wish you to be going through this. I knew I was hormone negative but had been waiting on the Her2 results. The oncologist said that it was good the Her2 was negative and the prognosis was better but its hard not to worry. I am having 3 FEC and 3 Taxotere and then surgery followed by radiotherapy so its a long haul! While my lump is small I know I have lymph node involvement which is also a worry. Waiting on the results of bone scan and a CT booked for next week. Taking this a day at a time and remaining positive with some wobbly moments thrown in! Hope evryone in the same boat is doing ok.
