    "Content": "Hi Seasons I just noticed your post having joined today. It was good to read your experience having had your treatment plan and being further on then your first diagnosis. I have recently been diagnosed with ductal invasive cancer, and came as a complete shock, having had my annual mammogram, then called back for a follow up mammogram biopsy all a bit overwhelming. I have begun to read as much as I can but there is so much information for different scenarios of treatment. I am at present awaiting test results from genetics blood test as I have a strong family history of cancer, so feeling very anxious, the waiting time is the worst. I am taking  tablets to hopefully shrink the cancer a little. So any information or support would be really good with your own experiences. Many thanks",
