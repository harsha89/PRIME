    "Content": "The new brave the shave fundraisingÂ  has had a lot of people talking about and I've yet to hear or read a positive mention. My personal feeling is its thoughtless selfish and so oooooo insensitive. I'm about to embark on another round of chemo ..my 4th over 20 years. I'm terminal and one thing that really effects me is the hair loss. This advert is so upsetting I hate it . I can't believe that Macmillan could be so stupid to make an add like it and not expect a bad reaction from the real.people it effects. If my family said they will shave their hair of to be 'brave' I would be sickened.. It's also about time someone from Macmillan explained why they think it was good to joke about such a painful part of Cancer treatment..It's disgusting. I will NOT be supporting you on this one. ...a very hurt cancer patient.",
