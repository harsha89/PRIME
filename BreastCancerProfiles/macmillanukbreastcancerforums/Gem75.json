      "Content": "I did tell her I'd got a letter asking me to go to an appointment yesterday. I said yes because I just wanted to have something on the system. I'm hoping the nurse will be able to sort out something more sensible later! I'm pretty sure the department won't want me to wait until the 24th if the letter asking me to the appointment was sent in such a hurry it didn't get here in time! It's piles and piles of extra stress! Not just because of the wait, but the fact they want to see me is almost confirming the worst without having it actually confirmed! The whole thing is driving me crackers now.",

      "Content": "Had a lump removed last Wednesday, went to wound clinic on Monday, was told on both occasions they'd call me yesterday to either give me my results (good news) or arrange an appointment (not so good). No one called yesterday, so I rang this morning and the bcn I spoke to said they'd had a lot of surgery and pathology had had a busy week so my results may not have come back but she'd ring me after lunch. I've just got back from Tesco to a letter from the hospital through the post asking me to go to an appointment yesterday! Argh! Rang up the number on the letter for appointments and she asked if the 24th April was ok! I said yes, but I'm hoping to sort it out with the bcn later because really? The 24th April?! That's another three weeks away! And if it was fine they wouldn't want to see me at all! How annoying and ridiculous! /end rant",
