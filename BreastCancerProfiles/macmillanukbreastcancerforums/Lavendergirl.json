I have now discovered sporting salt baths - I think it is epsom salts.   I bought a big bag from that chemist beginning with B and have testing this for a week - definitely a massive improvement, been having a bath in early evening - mornings are great I come down the stairs nearly normally. I have no idea if there is any real evidence behind the baths, but I am sharing anyway and would be good to know if anyone else has used!   All the best.",

In that way no other poor unfortunate soul will stumble in to the responses I have received (not Caroline) I disagree with your comments about blindly going into traditional NICE pathways.   A few points.  Throughout the western world where mass breast screening is undertaken, there is debate with regard to over treatment of breast cancer.  One European country has dropped mass screening due to this research, which is suggesting the treatment of low grade lesions is not improving the survival rates.  Thinking that chloecat is undertaking a one woman clinical trial which is going to benefit us all is just so really ill informed, she has her own contra health conditions. Of course I wish her and anyone else all the very best on their chosen approach, what I want to say, is be accurate in your posts, as other women, not so fortunate to have a less aggressive cancer may believe what your are posting. Lastly,  the NHS makes mistakes, private services makes mistakes, we've just locked up one breast surgeon who mainly operated out the the private sector, who really did mutilate women unnecessarily.

      "Content": "Hi Pat Welcome.   The most likely reason for a second operation is because the lump removed shows an insufficient  margin of healthy tissue.   The surgeon is guided by the scans and sometimes a guide wire, but only examination under a microscope can determine if everything has been removed, so the aim is to get a \u201cmargin\u201d of healthy tissue around the site.  Everyone who is on the NHS BC pathway is looked after by multi disciplinary team, this includes a surgeon, nurse, oncologist, radiologist etc, they meet weekly and discuss cases and agree next best course of action, this is standard practice, so please don\u2019t worry about that.  It\u2019s difficult to know what decisions they will be making precisely about your relative, but the meeting is used to discuss pathology results and best treatment plan going forward. I have made an assumption here, so perhaps test gently with your relative if the above description rings bells as I would hate to have steered you in the wrong way.  Many people have a second operation, I did myself, and was much easier than the first.  Good luck.",

      "Content": "Hi This is an interesting debate.  World wide clinicians have been discussing the efficacy of treating screen detected low grade breast cancers.  When I had my diagnosis several doctor friends commented that it was down to me about how risky I wanted to be.  One European country has dropped mass population screening on the basis of research indicating that these low risk cancers can be lived with and do us no harm. I\u2019m a scientist by background so rightly or wrongly tend to be guided by evidence and numbers, for me I went with the whole treatment plan on the grounds there is strong evidence that surgery, Radiotherapy and AIs has proved to be the most successful in eliminating re-currence.   There is another thread running at the moment discussing lifestyles etc, which is fascinating,  my conclusion on that debate is, it doesn\u2019t matter what you eat or drink, and that was certainly the view of my oncologist.  The only thing I do think that has some strong evidence is exercise, and even if that is wrong, it\u2019s not going to hurt you!  I do feel very strongly that alternative diets and therapies make no difference what so ever, but again I think if it helps you there is no Harm.  I take calcium with vitD even though I know clinicians think this is entirely a waste of money but I\u2019m not going to stop. I admire you.  I couldn\u2019t take your path, as once Pandora\u2019s box was open for me I would have worried I had refused what had the proven evidence base for success.   What ever your choice good luck, a healthy lifestyle is always going to help no matter what.

      "Content": "Shocking thread.  What I find odd is we talk about telling newly diagnosed  BC patients to only access credible sites, and not internetting Dr Google as there is so much scary information out there, and here we go with a lot of nonsense being posted.  It isn\u2019t really fair is it? I do think there should be a separate page McMillan puts up so that people who want to discuss this stuff can do can do so at their hearts content.  So let\u2019s be clear, lots of evidence about living healthily, eat well, exercise well, will basically keep you well.   Lots of evidence of women who have chosen alternative therapies to cure their breast cancer, I.e. drinking lemon or drinking plant based diets you will die. The point was from the original poster was to warn people away from non credible treatments, and loads of people have bowled on here and added to it.",

Findings suspicious of malignancy 5. Findings highly suspicious of malignancy If you do ever look anything up on the internet, always look at authenticated work, ie. Royal College.  So you can see that a 3 is probably benign.  xxx",

      "Content": "Hi Leonlaw Sorry you find yourself here.  Indeterminate is a radiologist grading.  They have, I think 4 grades, and it means as you have described, they are just not sure.  I had two lumps.  One was a 4 which is a definite, the other an indeterminate.  They were fairly certain it was nothing but on histology it turned out to be a grade 2 cancer.  Radiologists are brilliant clinicians but sometimes the scans just can\u2019t show the full dimension.    I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s one of those things that they just can\u2019t tell until they get the tissue under a microscope.  It doesn\u2019t mean to say this will be the same for you, so please don\u2019t leap to that conclusion (hard I know).  Good luck.
