    "Content": "Hi Our daughter has just been diagnosed with BC. she has been told that she will lose her hair and as she is only 25 we want to try to sort out a good wig for her. We are in Billericay Essex and would appreciate any info on suppliers of wigs around here. We would prefer a real hair wig as our other daughter is a hair dresser and will shape and style it for her. Thanks Terrytur",
