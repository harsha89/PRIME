    "Content": "Hi, I know exactly how you're feeling. I too was positive all the way through surgery and treatments. I was diagnosed last November with a tumour in the left breast. I had a mastectomy and node clearance in December followed by 6 lots of chemo and 25 sessions of radiotherapy, I'm now on Letrozole for 5 years. I've now developed Lymphodema and even though I exercise twice daily I've got to have physiotherapy because the scar from the mastectomy is so tight I can't raise my arm properly. Like you I am experiencing problems with my heart I had an echocardiogram on Saturday just waiting for the results, They haven't said what's causing it but I know I never had this before the treatments! I'm also feeling more tired now than when I was going through treatment, it's a struggle to keep positive and I find I'm getting tetchy with people which wasn't happening before. Lets try and regain our positivity together. Take care Pauline",
