      "Content": "Lacomtekp Hi Jemily, In my view you've more than passed the first test! What a lovely daughter you are........here you are asking immediately what can I do and will I be able to do it. Together you and your mum will work out what she needs. My experience from life is, that if you have to do something,you can. So please stop worrying yourself. You're going to make a great team. Now some practicalities. You will probably find that even if she is unlucky to vomit, she won't have been eating so from your point of view there won't be lots of mess. Just mum needing someone to hold or change a bowl, and put their arm around her when she's at a low ebb. My son was amazing. He set up the phones so I only had to ring an internal call button and if I was upstairs the phone rang downstairs and he came flying up to help me. The days after each chemo I vomitted a lot but I also needed to go to toilet lots too. If I moved on my own I was sick so it was great he was happy to help me to the bathroom and wait outside, then help me back. He brought me plenty of water to drink. He tried to tempt me to eat with toast or scrambled eggs. I didn't have to do anything. One area though  where my 'men' failed was helping me to wash when I was feeling very sick. I had a few accidents on the way to the toilet and could have done with a bit of female assistance. If you are aware this might happen to your mum, you can probably ask her from time to time, if she needs help., She will probably want to paint her nails daily with 2 coates of evonail. Maybe something else you can do. I always make a mess of my left hand! And remember........we are all different. She may not have more than a little nausea and then she will just need your company. You will probably have read, like I have, how difficult some ladies' families are towards them so its lovely to read how much you care and much support your mum is going to have. I hope all goes well for you both. Keep in touch and any problems you encounter, the experience on site, will find you an answer. Take care Love Karen Hi! Wow sounds like your son was absolutely brilliant!! Well done him   I've been told that everyone's different so we should take each day as it comes! Thank you for your tips as I will certainly take those on board! I definitely think company is what she needs to keep her spirits up! Best wishes  J X ",

      "Content": "Hi Guys, I wrote on here about 3/4 weeks ago when my mum was first diagnosed with breast cancer. I was amazed by the support and invaluable information I was given from you all!  We had another appointment yesterday which was to find out the treatment for her cancer etc. We thought it was going to be straight forward as we were told chemo probably won't be needed. However sadly my mum will need to have chemo :( We are both so so upset about this! I am absolutely terrified.  I am scared I won't be strong enough for her. I don't \"do\" vomit very well so I'm scared I'll not be able to help her, I'm also worried about hair loss and how devastating it will be for her.  Can anyone please help me and explain what is to be expected. Any tips and hints to get through this time. She has to decide whether or not to have the op \"pre chemo\" or \"post chemo\". Whats everyones advice on this? sorry to overload, I hope you can help me!! J xx ",

      "Content": "Hello, Thank you for your response!  We have been told that her lymph nodes seem clear however will need one or more removed for further testing and to be certain. My mum is 47 so young really, she has health on her side and she's a fighter!!  She's not taken chemo news well and like myself, she is very scared  I'm told everyone's different but I'm put at ease a bit more hearing you say it's doable and you weren't sick etc... I will mention the cold cap again to her and see what she thinks. I'm so glad you're feeling back to normal. That's brilliant news! I hope you continue to get stronger and stronger every day! All the best J X ",

Can anyone give me some advice on what my mum will need going forward. I want to be there for her the whole step of the way.  How soon do the doctors get things underway? How painful is the whole process? I want to prepare myself so I can be as strong for  her as I can. Thank you x ",

      "Content": "Hi,  Thanks for your response. I'm so sorry to hear you've been through all of that  but it sounds like you're fighting through and doing a degree too!! Amazing!  I must say my mum is very strong and has been taking the news better then I probably would! She just feels very tired which I am putting down to emotional stress. We don't know anything about what treatment she needs yet and I think that's why I'm really struggling. I am scared I can't be strong enough for her and as the days go by I'm finding the news harder to bare.  I don't live with her as I moved out recently with my partner but I'm at her house every night since the diagnosis and have been sleeping round too to keep her company. I have found these forums helpful too so thank you again. Best wishes to you too and I hope all you're very well in your recovery  Xx ",

I am finding it very hard to come to terms with at the moment, much harder then mum!! Which is weird and I feel almost guilty about that.  When we get a treatment plan in place I think we will all feel better. And you're right, sooo many people have spoken to me about having cancer and recovering and being absolutely fine now which is so positive!  Thank you for your words Best wishes  Xxx ",

      "Content": "Hi Lynn,  Thank you very much for your advice.  I do have a younger brother who is 17, I will be making sure he is ok too and has someone to talk to. Me and my mum are very close so he sometimes feels left out. I want to make sure we all come together during this time to support mum.  I mentioned in another reply that I live with my partner so not with my mum anymore so I'm finding it hard going back and forth. I've kinda moved back in since the diagnosis just to give her some support and company.  I will take notes from now on to make sure nothing is missed. Mum always asks me about medical things because she knows I like to research EVERYTHING!! it's our little joke really...  Thank you for the tips. I appreciate that very much. Best wishes Xx ",

      "Content": "Hello Carolyn, Thank you for responding to me, your message was so appreciated.  It sounds like you had quite an ordeal but your daughters strength and help saw you through. That is definitely something I want to do for my own mum.  I am so pleased to see 90% of cases people survive and this is reassuring for me and my mum. I feel as though life seems very surreal right now and mum has expressed feeling as though its an \"out of body\" experience telling people she has cancer. This is the hardest part I think. I am going with mum to every appointment because really she hasn't got any family that live in the country so I am her only family support. I don't want her going this alone either.  I attend uni where we all live as I didn't move away to study which makes this much better and easier to support her.  Its the stress of the waiting game now which is hard but once we know fully what we are dealing with and what treatment she will need we can start to make plans and move forward.  Doctors yesterday said that they weren't really going to mention chemo yet which to me seems positive because perhaps they think it can be treated in other ways. This is one positive!!  Thank you for your kind words, I wish you such a speedy recovery and all the health in the world :) and love to your daughter as I am 21 so a similar age and sadly now know how she feels...

      "Content": "Hello again Kerry, Thank you for your message. I found the \"ask a nurse\" section very helpful and she answered so many of my questions very well and these are answers I've shared with my mum this evening and seeing her face light up has made me so happy. She has been touched by responses to my posts'. I think she was shocked that I went and did all of this and found out answers for her. She looks more relaxed after reading some of this to her :) I can't believe you had all of that done and walked out at 4pm that day!! Thats incredible but really reassuring that it is so manageable. You've shed some light on the process which is massively appreciated as this was a grey area for us both.  I've managed to talk to a friend today all about mums breast cancer without crying which I thought was a great step. I am slowly seeing its ok to say she has cancer because it is a fact but I must remember it is not a death sentence and you're proof of that and so are all the other ladies on here! This is positive.  I've shared your suggestion of the \"family and friends cancer group\" on Facebook with mum and she thinks its great!! We will be doing that as we have family in France and Spain and all over the UK so to connect with everyone at the same time would be so good!!  We love to do spa days so I will be looking into doing something like that once a month maybe with mum, even just a movie evening together with face packs and chocolate. Lots of uplifting and laughter. I am so pleased I have chosen to come onto this site and share my worries with you, I don't want to make my mum worried about me when she has herself to focus on. At least I can come on here and ask you guys what to expect, I feel it gives me some control and power over this horrible evil illness.  Thank you for your words, hugs  Jemima xx ",

      "Content": "Hi Kerry, wow, what a response! I can't tell you how much I appreciate that message. It made me cry! You clarified so many questions and things I was worried about. My mum has had a mammogram, ultrasound and 4 biopsy's. She was found to have dense breast tissue which made cancer very difficult to see on any of the scans. The \"lump\" that she felt was quite big but they did struggle to see it in the screenings. She had 4 biopsy's and we received the bad news yesterday. The cancer is hormone responsive too which sounds like what you had? We were told this is a positive thing as tablets can be taken. It has been put at a grade 2? I believe this means it has grown outside of where it originated from but I don't know what it means in terms of how bad it is... This is what is worrying me.  She needs an MRI scan to determine how big the mass is because as I said the scans were very hard to read. They will be taking lymph node samples on Tuesday too to see if it has spread at all. They want to see how big the tumour is before they operate as this will determine whether it is a mastectomy or just removal of the lump.  I am just so broken hearted that this has happened to my wonderful mum. She has been through an awful lot and my dad left us about 5 years ago which makes this all so much worse. She has not got a partner or anyone to lean on. She has amazing friends and family (our family live abroad however which makes it hard when you need a hug!!). I feel I have to take the weight of this to support her, I'm 21 and about to finish my degree this year coming. I'm so scared for the future and what may come of all of this. Right now I don't feel like I have anything to look forward to because I just don't know what's going to happen. My mum is my world and the idea of her going through this kills me.  I am so touched by your response, thank you and it is great it is coming from another mother as I can begin to understand her perspective! hugs back, and I truly hope you're feeling well again and are making a very speedy recovery!
