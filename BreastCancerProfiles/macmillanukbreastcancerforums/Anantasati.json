I was expecting the FEC to be worse than the tax.  Someone advised I should just take it one step at a time and one day at a time.  People seem to have different reaction to the tax and I really hope it will be fine for you.  Good luck for tomorrow.  I will be thinking of you.

      "Content": "Hi all George and Jackie suggested I join this group after I posted a message on the Chemo group.  They have been really helpful with advice and suggestions.  I would welcome any more that you may have.  Thank you.  I was diagnosed with breast cancer at the end of July.  Since then things have been a whirl with tests, scans, etc.  Fortunately the sentinel node biopsy showed no signs of cancer.  I am having six cycles of chemo every 3 weeks starting with Docetaxel ('T') and then FEC.  I will have a lumpectomy after that.  I know others have them in a different order and wonder how the oncologists make their decisions for this.  I had incredible pain in my joints (particularly in legs and hips) after the first 'T' session.  I was having gcsf injections but these were stopped after I had three of them.  I had an allergic reaction to the chemo at the second 'T' session. So I will now have to be desensitized to the drug by administering it very slowly, which will take much longer - instead of 3-4 hours, it will be 8-10 hours!  I will take my Kindle and think of other ways to pass the time.  I was having the cold cap but won't bother now as I can't bear keeping it on for that long.  Besides, despite having had the cold cap, I have noticed more and more of my hair is falling out.  It has been useful to read others' posts and replies.  I am now looking forward to watching Downton tonight. Good luck and best wishes M",

      "Content": "Hi Katie The tax itself should also only take 1 hour.  As I have diabetes I was given steroids and anti-sickness intravenously first then the tax.  So I guess it should only be 1.5 - 2 hours, but as I was having the cold cap - I had to have that put on first for 30-45 minutes before the infusions started and also had to keep the cap on 1 hour after the tax.  I was also given steroid tablets to take that evening and the following morning which meant I was wide awake that night.  I found this strange not to feel sleepy at all.  I had very painful joints, particularly in my legs (mostly knees) and in the hips on the 3rd day.  So I would advise you to make sure you have painkillers at home - co-comadol/paracetomol and ibuprofen.  I took paracetomol and ibuprofen at the same time.  The antibiotics I had to take on Day 7 messed up my digestive system and felt bloated and constipated.  Hope that helps. Good luck with the tax. Mx",

      "Content": "Hello JuJuxx I guess I have the joys of the nausea and chemo head to come with FEC!  And still have 2 tax to go. :-(  The Specialist nurse confirmed the pain in the joints is caused by the tax.  I can't believe I have only had 1 tax and yet my lump has definitely shrunk.  I get pain there from time to time but it's not too bad.  It's great that your lump has shrunk so much. I know I won't have a mastectomy.  George and Jackie mentioned that the lumpectomy is called WLE (wide local excision).  I wonder how much tissue they will remove.  I am just beginning to understand the effects of the chemo on my body but as you say - it is the price we have to pay.  Thanks for the info re nourishing foods - the beetroot, water cress, etc are on my shopping list.  Also, greens for iron.  I'll also have to get the Manuka honey.  I used Bonjela which did the trick and Corsodyl mouthwash.  I already have coconut water.  I have noticed I prefer fresh fruit and veg more now than ready meals - it is like my body knows what it needs. :-)  The nurses have also said to eat things I crave.  I have my appointment for the wig on the 26th.  I need to decide whether to have a real hair one or not.  I read that the synthetic ones are easier to look after but can be itchy and hot. I am pleased to hear that the hair starts growing back 3 weeks after the chemo treatment finishes, though several women have said it grows very curly at first.    I was told they would reduce the tax as I had so much pain after the first one - and still had the allergic reaction.  I hope you won't have the reaction.  At least you are aware so you can alert the nurses quickly if you notice anything unusual. I am so glad I was recommended this site.  Thanks again for your advice and tips. Hope your 2 tax sessions go well.  Let me know how you get on.  Best wishes Mxx",

Hang in there - you will get through this and beat this.  Hugs M xx",

      "Content": "Hi Last July, I was diagnosed with Stage 3, triple negative breast cancer in my left breast just above my heart.  I had chemotherapy (final one in Dec), a lumpectomy (in January)  and 3.5 weeks of radiotherapy (last one on 29 April).  The side effects from the radiotherapy were really bad and I was itchy and very sore.  I had an infection on the nipple which treated with Savlon.  On Friday 15 May, I went to my GP to obtain a Fit for Work statement so I could return to work this week.  She examined me and was concerned about the dense tissue where the tumour had been.  That area feels hard, the rest of my breast is soft.  I also have occasional twinges of pain.  I managed to arrange an appointment with the radiology consultant.  He said the denseness could be because of tissue knitting together following my lumpectomy, but he has arranged for an ultrasound and a biopsy if necessary.  The appointment for the US is on 27 May. One of the radiologists said it is unlikely that it is a recurrence so soon after the chemo and radiotherapy.  I am really worried that it has come back. I know I shouldn't worry until I know more after the ultrasound.  Part of me is sure it has come back because some cancer cells may have been left behind and could not be detected.  Being Stage 3, it was aggressive and it did not respond well to Docetaxel.  The tumour grew.  It shrank after the FEC treatment - so much so that I had the lumpectomy rather than a mastectomy.  I have also read on this forum that I won't be able to have more radiotherapy on the previously treated area.  Has anyone else had recurrence within weeks of completion of treatment?  I hate the thought of going through treatment again.  I am also wondering what my options will be for treating it this time, because the same chemo drugs may not be as effective.  Would having a mastectomy improve my chances?  Thank you.
