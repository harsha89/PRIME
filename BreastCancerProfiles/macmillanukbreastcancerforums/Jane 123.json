      "Content": "Can any one help ? I have a white spot on my nipple ( right ) it's been there for nearly a month. I've previously had breast cancer many years ago ( left side ). I'm not pregnant and never had children. So I presume it's not a milk duct. I don't want to go to my GP ( stupid as it may seem ) as having cancer has already left me feeling like a hypochondriac.  What could it be ? ",

      "Content": "Crystaljuju Hi jane123  It does sound innocent but I'm not a medical professional, none of us are. The only definitive answer you will get is from a GP. On the basis your nipple has changed, it needs checking out. I don't think you could ever be accused of being a hyperchondriac having had cancer once before. We more than any, should be more in tune and watchful over any changes in our body. GPs careers are based upon giving medical advice so never feel like you are wasting time.  All the best  Julia ",
