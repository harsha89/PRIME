      "Content": "My portacath looks something like a soft contac lens holder without the screw top lids, if you can imagine that, but about 1/2 to 3/4 smaller. The docs should be able to show you one. The only time I need a flush (with saline and heparin) is when it is used, no other time. The day surgery is done under a local with you underneath a bunch of draping covers. I could speak and hear perfectly fine. I lied still and they worked their magic. They made about a 1/2\" incision in my chest and placed the cath just under the skin. Mine is vertically placed. There is a small diametered tubing connected to it which threads up over my collar bone and into the large vein in my neck. There is a small, ~",

      "Content": "I have the portocath. My insurance paid for mine. It was put in as day surgery so I was able to go home that same day. The only pain you have is when they tell you, \"Just a pinch and a burn.\" Literally less than 5 seconds of ouuucccchhhh. Afterwards, when the cath gets accessed, it is a moment of ouuuch and the line is established to draw bloods from it or to give you meds, etc. No more arm/hand sticks. Just make sure the folks that need to flush the lines do it in a timely fashion (it can clot off) as one of mine is slow to flush now because of that. Mine also has 2 line ports, not just one. If you have any other questions don't hesitate to ask :)",
