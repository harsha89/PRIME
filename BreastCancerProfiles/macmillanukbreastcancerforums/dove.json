      "Content": "Hi Maz I feel a bit of a newbie myself - although I joined back in January I didnt post for ages - I just struggled finding my way around the site! But you have made a start and that always helps. It sounds like your back problems occurred before the bc? How come the breast cancer team didn't pick up on this and investigate for you! Thank God you went and got that MRI done privately. The spread to my bones was found when I knew I had problems because of the swollen lymph nodes around my neck. One day I had really bad sciatica and contacted the hospital straight away and they arranged all the scans etc. Something that may be worth discussing with your oncologist at a later date will be whether or not he/she will consider breast surgery to remove the lumps? Some say they don't do surgery on the breasts if secondaries are found at diagnosis but there is a school of thought developing that favours surgery when things are stable. I know that feeling of satisfaction when we get news that our bones are starting to 'repair'. I was thrilled when I saw the difference in the scans. My cancer was also her2 positive so I have been on herceptin now for 6 years. I found with that and the bone treatment I had no side effects that I noticed. It sounds like you have done really well on the taxotere - that is usually a tough drug with a lot of side effects. I was on it for 8 treatments back in 1999. How far have you got with the taxotere? If your mouth is sore are you using mouthwashes the hospital usually prescribe? Also a lot of people find frozen pineapple cubes really do help. Dove xx",

      "Content": "Hi Cat, I wanted to respond to what you said in your post above. I too remember asking to see the bone scans so I could compare the one taken when the bone mets was first diagnosed, and one subsequently when there was some improvement. They were truly quite shocking! as you said huge black circles everywhere. I couldnt help noticing so many in the skull area. After the first year of bisphosphonate the skull ones cannot be seen on a bone scan any more and quite a few others 'faded'. The skull ones show up on mri & ct as 'damage'. As Cat says Kerry I hope your Mum takes encouragement from our stories. Dove xx",

I am a little older than your mum (63) and my breast cancer spread very extensively into my bones back in 2002, and my original dx was in 1990. My type of breast cancer differs from your mums which must be what we call hormone positive for her to be having tamoxifen. Mine is not hormone positive, but is her2 positive and so I have herceptin regularly every 3 weeks along with a bisphosphonate (in my case pamidronate). Over the past 7 years I have had some radiotherapy to areas that caused pain and sometimes that has helped and sometimes not. My oncologists also held back on chemo when bone 2ndaries was diagnosed because I had already had several types and we were running out of options. But I think the treatment she is being offered is fairly standard when there is a diagnosis of bone mets with no further organ problems. Dove xx",

      "Content": "Hi Noj,   I am happy to help if I can. One thing I want to point out is that you have not mentioned Hickman Lines - they are the other option that is frequently offerend along with PICC and ports. Over the years I have had 3 hickman lines, and currently have a port. I come under the Surrey PCT (at the Sutton Marsden). I actually requested a Port before my veins finally caved in and my oncologist thought it was a good a good idea. Another point I would make is that many hospitals still don't fit Ports or have nurses trained in the use of them. Of course this adds to the expense as they have to be 'trained'. It makes sense for me to have a port because my treatment is long term and my port is accessed every 3 weeks, and has been for almost 3 years now. I think there are so many areas of the NHS where treatments etc. are held back because of cost when in the long term it will actually save money. One area is with bisphosphonates. The newest one(zometa) is obviously the most expensive by it takes a fraction of the time to administer (15 mins) compared with say pamidronate which takes 90 mins. Our chemo unit is so busy and frequently there are insufficient seats so obviously the faster treatments can be administered the quick seats are freed up. I suppose the same goes when oral treatments can be used compared with iv treatments. I wish you luck in your MBA and the research you are doing and would be happy to help.   Dove",

I was told total hair loss for this one and no the cold cap just did not work for this one either. I asked for the cold cap just because I was stubborn. I used it and I never lost any hair from my head - I did lose it all elsewhere - which proves I think that if I had not had the cold cap I would certainly have lost it from my scalp. On another occasion I was on ECF which is different to FEC in that E=Epirubicin, C=carboplatin, F=flurouracil/5-FU. I had some thinning but kept a reasonable covering. All this took place back in the 90s and there were no fancy caps or machines then. A number of icepack were moulded around a polystyrene head and kept in a freezer. They were then removed and placed on your head and squeezed around until they formed a reasonably close covering! But it worked. It was messy cos as they thawed out they dripped all over you, so you were swathed in towels and blankets. In some crazy way it was fun - well you have to keep a sense of humour dont you! It was painful at first but I always took a painkiller a while before we started. I felt it was all worth it because I couldn't bear the thought of losing my hair. Dove xx",

      "Content": "Hi Chris, Your post just highlights how individual is each persons 'journey' with cancer. It is indeed unusual for anyone with your dx of Stage 1 and no node involvement to progress to secondaries in such a short time. It makes me feel sad when I hear of oncologists saying things like without treatment xx months - with treatment a bit longer. Because we are all so individual I think to throw figures like that at a patient is so disheartening. Many many people with bc - even with 2ndaries live for considerably longer than average and of course some much shorter times. But to say you have 18 months to 2 years sounds too final to me. I don't have the same secondaries as you have - mine are extensive bone mets which were dx 7 years ago. When I was first diagnosed back in 1990 I never wanted to know what my life expectancy was - I just knew I had a particularly agressive cancer. I have had several new tumours and recurrences spread out over those 20 years but I am still here against any odds that would have been given at any point had I asked. I hope you get a really good response to your treatment and that the disease can be in remission for a good long time for you. Don't give up hope. Dove xx",

Only this past year have I started to have problems with pain in my lower spine so am a bit more restricted now. But there is much that can be done for bone mets.

My hospital (Royal Marsden) only does them under GA but I know many do it under local. If you go for that and have to pay for it I would ask questions about what happens if you get infection etc. (especially as you had mrsa previously). I have a friend who had one and was getting repeat infections and had to have it removed. Also I suspect if you have to pay to have it will you be expected to pay for removal. Has the hospital got nurses trained to use portacaths. I wonder if it is worth asking him again why you are being told you have to pay for it when other hospitals do not charge. I wish you luck.

I have done many and some have been relatively easy and others have been hell. Have you talked to your oncologist about reducing the dosage., and finding an anti-nausea pill that does work for you. Tell them clearly that you are having it bad and tempted to opt out - they need to take you seriously. Most chemos I have been on have had the dosage reduced by 25% because the side effects were too bad. It is important for you to have the chemo because you are Her2+++ and that is an aggressive form. You cannot have the herceptin unless you have had the chemo. I did not get herceptin until I had secondaries - long story cos I was diagnosed back in 1990 before her2 was even known about. I kept getting new primaries/recurrences, then I had regional spread to neck area and at that point they found I was her2+++ and it was like magic - within a few days of being on herceptin I could visibly see/feel all the lymph nodes go down. This was almost 6 years ago now and I have had no further recurrences. Rebilla I am sorry to hear you are having so much sickness with your chemo. Are you one 3 FEC /3 Taxotere? If so hopefully with just one more FEC to go the nausea will be better on the taxotere. As I said to Dragon - it is always possible to reduce the dosage on these chemos if you are having really bad side effects. I would say try being proactive and ask your onc to do that! I know we have to put up with a certain amount of side effects but if the antidotes aren't working then I think that is too much to cope with. Dove xx",
