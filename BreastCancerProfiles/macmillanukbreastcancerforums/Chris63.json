      "Content": "Hi everyone, I new to this so please bear with me. I was diagnosed with stage 1 breast cancer in Febrauary '07 no lymph nodes were involved. I had the tumour removed and had 3 weeks of radiotherapy and put on tamoxifen. I have complain about some breast pain but that was investigated and all came back negative . The consultant said it was probably the scar tissue healing itself. In January I started getting back pain and went to the gp who suggested I went for an xray. Thatr came back fine but the pain didn't go away. I went back for another xray and the gp said it was radiation damage of the nerves. Something I would have to live with and gave me pregamblin which sends the nerves to sleep and co codamol. The pain didn't get any easier and the fluid began to build up I went back and requested a ultra sound. which took about two weeks. The radiologist was concerned and said that there was a lot of pooling around the lung and ask for another xray to be done that day. Two days later I spoke to the gp who referred me to a lung specialist and order a ct scan which took nearly 3 weeks. The way forward was to do an aspiration to establish where the fluid was from and what it contain. I by this time was tearing my hair out and full of fluid around by right torso. Eventually the fluid was drain and a biopsy done. I found out the next week that I had secondary cancer which had spread into the pleural lining which had spread from the orginal breast cancer. I have been referred to see my orginal onocologist its been nearly seven months since I when to the gp and the outcome doesn't asound to good. My gp is not very optimistic about my outcome. I am 46 years old with three children the youngest is 16. Is there anyone out there that has been through a similar experience and could you give me any info about treatments. I feel I have just been left in a very dark place with no where to go apart from playing the waiting game. Many thanks for getting down this far and all responses are very welcome Best wishes to you all Chris",

      "Content": "Hi Tess, Thank - you for your reply and I'm sorry you're are going through this devasting time. I had the same procedure in march '07. Although I didn't have a bone scan until April this year which was clear. I am er positive and thats how they found out were the cells were from. The consultant said they had a hard time mapping them. (finding out were they orginated from) The results from my lymphs nodes were clear and the consultant said it was the best possible prognosis. Unfortunately for me they must have missed some cells and here I am again. Your are absolutely right the worse part is waiting and not knowing. Hopefully after today's meeting I will have some long awaited news. I know everyone is different but I know lots of people who have had bone mets for over 20 years and still going, but I hope that your scan will come back clear. Lots of women go through this and there is no recurrence. I wish you all the best for Thursday and will be thinking of you. With best wishes Chris",

      "Content": "Hi, I've written on this forum recently and have now seen my oncologist yesterday. It has taken 6 1/2 months to diagnose I have secondary breast cancer as the consultants could not believe that the cancer had spread from the orginal site as it was stage 1 with no lymph nodes involved. I have it in the pleural lining and a spot on my lung which they cannot do anything about as it is a secondary cancer I have changed from Tamoxifen to Arimidex which I am a bit worried about the side effects. I had trouble for the first year with the Tamoxifen but the side effescts seem to subside after then. The Chemo is FEC-T I have read up on the side effects and am hoping for the best. I have to remain positive through all this. The oncologist said if I didn't have the treatment I have got about a year to live. With the treatment between 18 months and 2 years. Feeling shocked and numb by it all. Any advise would be most welcome. Thanks and best wishes to you all Chris",

      "Content": "Hi, I just wanted to say thank - you to you all for you words of comfort and positive thinking, I think the effects of the Armidex started to kick in yesterday and I had a very bad day felt very depressed. I feel a little better this morning but had yet to taken the dreaded tablet. I never really wanted to know how long I may have to live but my husband wanted to know. Which with hindsight and the negative response I got from my own gp was understandable on his part. I think my gp already had my plot picked out, this has actually given my husband hope. I know this sounds weird, but even through I'm going through all this it has hit him so hard and I have to be strong for him. He has always been there for me and we have been together for 28 years. I am still waiting to hear from the hospital when the chemo starts oncologist said next week and I will chase it up. I have spoken to the breast cancer nurse and she said you have been passed from pillow to post. what an understatement! However, she said some people response really well to the chemo so I am going to remain positive and battle my way through the treatment. It can't be much worse than the pain I have initally before I was prescribed pregamblin and the painkillers. The fluid is my main problem and my overactive brain which is worry about everything and body else. My husband said to me you really must start thinking about yourself. Which is difficult when you spend you whole life looking after your family and working in social care. Thank - you for your positive post I do try and remain positive but still have my black days, I'm very good at putting on a good front. But my husband said its alright to let people see you're distressed and need support. I have requested a visit from the MacMillan nurse which is a huge step forward for an old marvick like me. Thank - you for reading my rant. love to you all Chris x x x",
