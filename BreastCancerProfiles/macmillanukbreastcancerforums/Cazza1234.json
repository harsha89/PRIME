    "Content": "Hi everyone, I was just diagnosed yesterday with breast cancer, 5 cm lump in breast and some in lymph nodes.  To say it was a shock is an understatement, it\u2019s so surreal, it doesn\u2019t feel real yet.   I have still to get scan to see if it\u2019s spread yet, but have already been told they will be starting with chemo after new year. My daughter is only 5 and as you can\u2019t imagine my head is spinning a million miles a hour with all the scenarios that could happen.  I\u2019m just lost at the moment. xx",
