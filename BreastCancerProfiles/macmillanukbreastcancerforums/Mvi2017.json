      "Content": "Hi Annak Sorry to intrude on your post. I hope I am not being insensitive here but please may I ask what form of bc you have been diagnosed with?  It is just I am in the same boat, been giving antibiotics for an infection but they aren't working. I've already had a biopsy and get my results on Friday.  But after my reading up like yourself i know what in going to be told. Which scares me to death as I'm a young mum with a 5 year old and a 6 week baby! Petrified doesn't come close.  And how quickly are they putting everything in action? Will you be needing chemo and have they already set a date for it.  Xxx wishing you all the best. ",

      "Content": "Thank you so much for replying and explaining your situation. It sounds like everything is moving as swiftly as possible for you and they are well on the way to start to make you better! Did you have symptoms that made you think you had inflammatory bc?  Some times I just want Friday to be here so I can get on with sorting it out. Other times I'm scared to death of being told and having my fear confirmed, I just keep thinking of my two tiny girls and how much they need me.  Thank you so much, I would really like to stay in contact and provide support for each either way.

And that the hospital staff are being comforting and supportive as I think that kind of care and reassurance really does make a difference. They will have you fighting this in no time! And you sound like a strong person so I know your going hit this head on!!  I see, so your symptoms are different to mine and why I am scared I have ibc. As of yet I don't have a time for Friday... I'm hoping my letter arrived today to clarify. If not received by tomorrow I will ring the consultants secretary to see if she can let me know.  Yes I do have a wonderful family who try their best to ease my anxiety but it's not much help I'm afraid. I am popping out with my sister and mother today to distract myself so hopefully that will help a bit. Having a new born means I'm not really out and about as much, I've tried popping for a walk or a drive but I find my head still comes back to this. But I'm trying to do better.  how long will it be till you get the results of all the scans you have been completing? Xxx ",

      "Content": "Hi there, I haven't been fully diagnosed yet but going in for some tests tomorrow and to get some answers. I am beyond terrified as I have suspected inflammatory breast cancer. I am 33 with a 5 year old and a 6 week old baby!  I've been so emotional today, I'm not sure how I am going to cope. I suffer from anxiety as it, this is making me a bit of a mess.  I feel the same- a bit lost in limbo, I can't quite believe this is happening.  Can I ask if you had any other symptoms other than a lump? Discolouration? Swelling? Pain? And how your coping with it all xxx ",
