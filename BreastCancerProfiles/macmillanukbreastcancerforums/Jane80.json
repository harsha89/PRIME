    "Content": "Hi there i am so sorry to hear you are going through this. I was diagnosed with triple negative breast cancer early in December. I have two boys 4 and 8. My first fear was for them and still is. Did you get the \u2018mummy\u2019s lump\u2019 book from the Macmillan nurse? It\u2019s so good at explaining things to young children. I told mine within two days of diagnosis. The youngest especially is doing fine and he looks at the book now and then and especially likes to focus on the last page where the family is happy again. i had surgery last Saturday and will start chemo early January. My lymph node was affected so they were all taken out but spread was only to two it turns out so that\u2019s positive. waitung for scan results for me was the worst. I was sure my full body ct would show something up but it was clear. I\u2019ve just had a PET scan as have pain in my shoulders which is probably tension but my oncologist wants to put my mind at rest. my advice to you having only just started this hideous journey is that you shouldn\u2019t google anything. I normally google loads of stuff but have avoided it like the plague since diagnosis. Trust in your doctors and nurses and listen to them. No two cancers are the same so your story will be unique. Just because things turned out one way for one person does not mean the same for you...good or bad. hopefully you have lots of support around you. Take all offers of help. You need to look after yourself in order to stay mentally strong for your daughter. The shock and anxiety during the waiting Â times completely floored me. I was physically wrecked before surgery purely down to the emotional toll. Please take care of yourself. Eat and rest even if you don\u2019t feel like it. wish you all the best and do stay in touch if it would help xx",
