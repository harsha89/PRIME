      "Content": "Hi Barfy, I was on Anastozole for about 10 months and was feeling so bad that I called my breast nurse and she told me to have a break and see the oncologist in 6 weeks. My symptoms were bad, aches and pains, terrible hot flushes that woke me up in the middle of the night so I never got any sleep. Significant hair loss and I felt miserable. Saw the oncologist who persuaded me to try letrozole and another drug for hot flushes (which turned out to be anti depressants which I haven\u2019t taken). Said I have 10% more chance of the cancer coming back if I don\u2019t take any medication. Spoke to my son who was against me stopping the drugs, (his father died 8 years ago and I suppose he was frightened of losing me). So letrozole has given me awful joint pain in my hips, back and hands (not good for someone who knits and sells stuff) and I also feel like a 90 year old. Can\u2019t get out of bed in the morning, always in pain. Just miserable again. I\u2019m going to come off it all and take my chances. With these tablets there is no quality of life, I dont feel like doing anything, work is hell now. so..... everyone is different and you just have to weigh up the plus\u2019s and minuses, I believe that if the cancer comes back, then you have to deal with it again, 10% more chance is not that much. I just want feel normal again. Good luck with your decision and do it for yourself, not your children as they are not the ones suffering the physical pain. sending love, Papplewick",

      "Content": "Hi little-Lizzie, Its Papplewick here! I\u2019ve just been to my oncologist and he has taken me off letrozole and prescribed Tamoxifen! I am having a break though and won\u2019t be taking anything until the New Year. He also tried to get me to take the anti depressant for hot flushes but I refused as I think I\u2019m taking enough pills. My joint pain was awful on letrozole but he says it will be better on tamoxifen. He did say that Tamoxifen can cause hair loss, and cancer of the womb as well. Thank god I have had a hysterectomy! If the Tamoxifen is as awful as the rest of the other tablets then I\u2019m done with it all. Won\u2019t be taking anything except my chances! 5 days pill free and I feel much better, although the joint pain is still there, it\u2019s not as bad. Just fed up with it all, and want a pain free life. Hope you get on with the Tamoxifen! sending love, Papplewick.  xxx",

I always went to work first and then had the radiotherapy.  As I said I\u2019m off letrozole, tried anastrozole, as well but nothing agrees with me. Having a break now. I wish you luck with it all, you are not alone. xx",

      "Content": "Hello All, Haven\u2019t posted since November as I have had a break from taking the tablets! Actually felt so much better for 2 months pill free. No joint pain, (except for my arthritis in my hands) no hot flushes, no mood swings and generally felt good. Well I\u2019ve been on Tamoxifen for 2 weeks now, and already the stiffness is back, depression and hot flushes, but the worse thing is I have a DVT (Deep Vein Thrombosis) in my lower left leg. My GP sent me to A and E on Friday as my leg had swollen up by 2\u201d and it was very painful to walk. Now I can\u2019t work, I have to inject myself in the stomach every day with anti coagulants and I\u2019m off to hospital on Monday to have a scan.  The only possible reason for this is Tamoxifen. I haven\u2019t been on a plane for 6 months, no trauma to my leg, I\u2019m not overweight and I exercise every day as I have 2 dogs to walk.  These cancer tablets are lethal! I\u2019ve been signed off by my oncologist for a year as he\u2019s fed up with me (this is the third cancer tablet I\u2019ve tried now) so the only alternative for me is to stop taking anything and hope for the best. I really can\u2019t believe that doctors just dish out these tablets and do not think of the damage that is possible. I understand not everyone has side effects from the cancer tablets, but I believe that not enough research is done to see what can happen after the cancer has gone and we all think we will be ok now. I\u2019m only writing this to warn you ladies that there are awful side effects from cancer tablets, and I think I\u2019m done with it now. Rant over, just be careful ladies!  Papplewick.",

      "Content": "Hiya, Just seen that we can\u2019t disclose our personal information, makes sense I suppose. If Macmillan gets the private messaging working then we can talk on there and maybe exchange details. I\u2019m curious as to where you are as it would be nice to meet up if we are near each other!  Regarding the Tamoxifen, I will start it in January but if I get any joint pain, then that\u2019s it! Funnily enough I seem to be getting really bad hot flushes now im not taking anything! I took a sleeping pill last night as I was so tired, couldn\u2019t sleep and fed up with being soooo hot! Worked a treat but couldn\u2019t get up this morning! Let\u2019s keep in touch on here and see if we can private message each other soon. Hugs, Papplewick. ❤️❤️❤️",

      "Content": "Hello Lizzie little!  Yes, what a game all this is! I haven\u2019t started taking the Tamoxifen as my oncologist suggested I flush everything out of my system and be pill free for Christmas so I\u2019m planning on starting in the new year. If it does not agree with me, then it\u2019s probably back to letrozole. I do not want a red nose, what\u2019s all that about!  I must say my joints are better already, I was worried that the damage had already been done and was not reversible but the doc says things should stop hurting once it\u2019s all out of my system. He also said that Tamoxifen causes hair loss so if that happens then I\u2019m stopping. You know we could be taking these tablets and doing untold damage. I read today in the paper that they are going to give cancer tablets to people who have high blood pressure as it has been proved to lower it. I bet they don\u2019t tell these people about the crippling side effects!  I too have been trying to private message you, but it doesn\u2019t seem to work. Facebook Instead maybe?  Keep on going, I know how you feel.  speak soon, love Papplewick.  ❤️❤️❤️❤️",
