      "Content": "I had a dodgy shoulder for over a year and my GP referred me for a nuclear bone scan and an x ray which showed a bony spur/calcium deposits and nothing sinister. It actually got better after I did some gentle weights work in the gym and I now have full range of movement. Hope yours is ok and gets better soon.",

      "Content": "Hi, I also had \"extensive lymphovascular invasion\" with grade 3 breast tumour but they have told me I do not need chemo as ER positive so the Letrozole will cover any cells which may have gone walkabouts as sentinel node was clear.  They also couldn't get clear margins as against chest wall.  I was assured that 5 radiotherapy boosts would cover that.  I really wish I could trust this information but have never had these problems pointed out to me only found out from path report which I requested. I wondered whether there was anyone else who hadn't had chemo despite lymphovascular invasion. All the best to you x",
