      "Content": "Hi. I am due to have a diep free flap reconstruction Mx on Thurs 14th march so this link has been so helpful.Thank you. Op has already been cancelled as I got really bad flu. But feel more prepared now so perhaps that flu was for the best. I think my biggest worry is not having a nipple. And the tummy bit will be odd as I am so used to having a bit of a podge. But thats why I'm such a perfect candidate for the op! Will report back if thats helpful. Hope your consultation goes well Bluetit. I am a nurse that looks after post op breast patients so will be very strange to be on the other side. Let you know how that goes! Vic",

      "Content": "I am 3 weeks following a Diep Free flap skin sparing Mastectomy. I have had very little pain . They removed my nipple and I am now getting shooting electric shock pains in the nipple area.It's like when your nipple gets really cold but all the time. I am trying to massage the area to reengage my brain and the nerves. Anyone had this or got any idea how long it may go on. With Thanks",
