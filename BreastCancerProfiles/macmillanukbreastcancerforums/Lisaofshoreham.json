    "Content": "First and foremost congratulations! I too found out yesterday that my surgery was completely successful However, I am triple negative meaning that my cancer has no hormone drivers and cannot be managed by just hormone therapy and radiotherapy, so I meet with my Oncology team for the first time on Monday to discuss chemotherapy. We are all lucky to have amazing medical teams around us who personalise the treatments specifically to our individual needs. Wishing you all the best for your future treatments xx",
