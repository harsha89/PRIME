      "Content": "Hello Linkj - I notice from your profile you are being given Zometa. I have been told I will take that too. Would you please advise when they started to give you it, how long they have said you will get it and is it an infusion or tablets?.  I will be starting chemo beginning of April, also Herceptin and then Radiotherapy. I haven't been told yet when I will get Zometa - I asked but was told 'one thing at a time', but I would like to have an idea just now. Many thanks. ",

      "Content": "I went to the cinema today. Just before the film the new 'Cancer doesn't care' advert came on by MacMillan. I found the advert really upsetting and by the time the film came on I was actually hyperventilating and felt dizzy. I thought about leaving the cinema. I had just wanted a couple of hours to get away from things, the cinema has always been my place of refuge from having to think about what's going on with my cancer, cancer of a couple of relations, work. My partner is really struggling with it all and he enjoys the cinema too - thankfully he wasn't at that screening. I hate the fact MacMillan are now advertising in cinemas. I can't switch it off, fast forward or mute it and close my eyes - it's in my face. There's one scene in the advert I have been seeing over and over again and I can't sleep, it's haunting me. I feel so angry about this. MacMillan does such a lot of good work, but this just feels cruel. I am going through cancer treatment, but I can't imagine how someone with more serious cancer than mine, or someone who has lost someone to it would feel. I have complained to MacMillan but I am anticipating I will just be told 'very sorry it's upset you but....' and will continue with the cinema adverts. I'm just one voice and what they want is donations and shock tactics mean people remember them. I fully appreciate many people may think it's a good way of raising awareness and raising funds, partly through shock tactics and please feel free to say so, but if anyone feels like I do, please let MacMillan know. There are a couple of other films I want to see, but I'm now going to avoid the cinema or make sure I know exactly when the film starts so I can try and avoid the advert. I'm going to make sure I record everything on commercial TV so I can fast forward adverts to avoid it. I didn't mind the adverts 'still a friend with cancer' etc, but this is on another level. ",
