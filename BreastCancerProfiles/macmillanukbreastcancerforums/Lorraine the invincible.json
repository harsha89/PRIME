      "Content": "Hi Sheena, Thanks for your quick response. I know, about 2 in the morning is my weak time too when the panic attacks, sweats, & heart palpitations set in. Am just starting to adjust to my diagnosis now so instead of being the centre of my thoughts 24 hours a day, it is now only there 23 hours. The radiotherapy is for my chest wall & neck, my onc has not suggested it for my bones as yet. Am meant to be starting the new quick infusion of bisphosphonates next time, can't remember the name but it begins with a 'Z' and was originally developed for prostrate cancer which had spread to bones. This will cut down the time from 1 1/2 hours to 15 mins which is great as I get too stiff sitting for a long time. I know you have coped with this in your bones for a long time, do you find any particular pain killers more effective which dosn't make you feel sick or aggravate your liver. Also do you take anything special to support your liver. I try to eat healthy and avoid alcohol (although been told by onc a glass of wine is ok). Although have complete faith in treatment, need to feel am taking charge of my life to some degree. Going now, 1st radiotherapy awaits!",

      "Content": "Hi Sheena, you are an inspiration to me as I was diagnosed with bc in March with subsequent scans revealing already had secondaries in liver and several bones. Have responded well to chemo, had mastectomy with lymph nodes removal and starting radiotherapy tomorrow. I do have Herceptin with my APD every 3 weeks. Was SO scared when told I was incurable and could only think I was going to die very, very soon. However, the more I hear from women such as yourself, the more hopeful I am that I do have some sort of a future. New treatments are out there just waiting for us I know. Hard to keep positive all the time but none of us know how long we are here for, and we just have to make sure we enjoy our lives as much as possible. Thank you again, every personal account I read that defies cancer gives me more hope. love to you x x x x",
