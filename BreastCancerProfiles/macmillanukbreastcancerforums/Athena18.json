      "Content": "Hi everyone!  On Thursday my little sister was diagnosed with stage 2 breast cancer that was spread to the lymph nodes. As a family we are absolutely devastated and in shock. I have never experienced a feeling like this and just don\u2019t know what to do. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s really hit my little sister fully yet and she is probably still in shock. She has her MRI scan on Monday and some other scans next week. They expect she will have to have a mastectomy and chemotherapy.   I didn\u2019t know where else to turn too so here I am!  ",

      "Content": "Thank you so much for your very comprehensive replies and your kind wishes! I am pretty sure I am going through the stages of grief (of the loss of normalcy). I woke this morning to just a desolate feeling where I literally don\u2019t care about doing anything other than being there for my sister and I am definitely more angry and looking for someone to blame now. I am hoping these feelings will go in time xx",

      "Content": "I don\u2019t know where else to turn. My little sister has been further diagnosed with secondary breast cancer in the bone, it\u2019s on her spine and in her pelvis. The prognosis is really bad but the doctors are going to throw everything they have at it. I am now facing the realisation that this isn\u2019t going to be a fight it\u2019s goibg to be all out war. I am in a lot of shock xx",
