    "Content": "Jump123 Hi There.  Started rads today and interview with nurse was alarming.  She launched into a spiel about skin reactions that included burns, blisters, open wounds and significant pain and said \"this is one time in your life when you should take as many strong painkillers as it takes to get you through\"  WTF!!!!!!!  I was a very reluctant starter and now terrified to turn up tomorrow.  Wonder if 1 session is considered therapeutic. Hi there, I'm halfway through 15 sessions of radiotherapy for breast cancer, and so far so good. Little bit pink and itchy but using moisturiser helps. NO pain at all up to now. I wasn't given that scary lecture and think it was a bit OTT. Hope this helps.",
