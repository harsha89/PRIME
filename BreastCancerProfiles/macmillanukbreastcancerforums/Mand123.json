I then got a pillow that goes around your neck to support it while asleep. It took me about a week to figure this out and wished someone would have told me.  Sorry to hear that you have to go through this.

Never had any surgery before this. Honestly, it's fine. I have to have a further op to remove expander and put in implant and they are also going to give my other breast a lift abx reduction and I'm actually looking forward to that! My friends and family can't believe it as I was truly terrified! The surgery is nothing that a bit of pain relief and relaxing on your sofa won't sort. I was out of hospital in 2 days and the nurses were amazing. Are you having immediate reconstruction?  Thanks for advice on chemo. I'm just having one of those days and need to put my big girl pants on! Xx",
