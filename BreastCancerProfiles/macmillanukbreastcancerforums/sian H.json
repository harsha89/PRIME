      "Content": "Wondering if someone out there has come across the following;- my friend has previously had breast cancer, now the BCN found a lump and noticed a dimpling of the skin.  (This is only when lying down and hand behind your head).  My friend has also felt the lump and agrees there is a 'dip' in the breast tissue - this is on the previously unaffected breast.  Been for an ultrasound today and they can't see anything?  Anyone come across this before and have any suggestions as to what may be the cause?  We can currently only think of asking for a mammogram, but would welcome any suggestions as to the likely cause or possible areas to investigate.  thanks in advance for reading.",

      "Content": "Best to speak to the breast care nurse or consultant regarding your worries as they will know why they are recommending tamoxifen for 3 years - it may simply be they plan to reassess at that point as it may be appropriate to change to one of the aromatose inhibitors at that time.  Regarding bone density you could ask for either a dexa scan or a heel scan.  My GP surgery have just got this new gadget that does the heel scans and gives an idea of bone density, so you know where your starting from.  I've just been diagnosed with osteoporosis and I'm not quite 50 yet!  Ask your GP to prescribe calcichew.  They are calcium and vitamin d supplements (they don't even taste that bad).  But I will say again, speak to your breast care nurse, phone up and ask to see her to go through your concerns that's what they are there for and she has your case notes so is well placed to alleviate your worries.",
