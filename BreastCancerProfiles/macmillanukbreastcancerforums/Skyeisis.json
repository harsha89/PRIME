      "Content": "Dear Deidre It kind of depends what kind of fear and anxiety you are experiencing. What might be helpful is if you go on the website getselfhelp.com and download the CBT (cognitive behavioural therapy) workbook. There are 7 parts and it covers mindfulness, imagery, breathing and relaxation, as well as helping you understand the connection between thoughts, feelings and behaviours. If the fear and anxiety become really overwhelming my advice is to go on the website EMDR UK and Ireland website and find an EMDR (eye movement Desensitisation and Reprocessing) therapist. This is a neurological technique where the brain reprocesses the emotions and related body sensations that are troubling you, and helps process negative thoughts also. You can find out more about it on you tube. It is used for processing trauma and a whole host of other mental health conditions including anxiety. I am a mental health nurse, working as a trauma therapist and use several therapies in my work. Try the CBT workbook first and also consider downloading the Headspace app. Good luck and best wishes Jane",

      "Content": "Hi Maxine I contacted addenbrookes in Cambridge where the clinical trial was led (Dr Coles). She found me a consultant nearer home for me in Birmingham. Because it's not yet recommended in NICE guidelines my local oncologist refused, even though that hospital has taken part in the national clinical trials. I respect that the oncologist said that it wasn't recommended yet as it's only just getting published and patients with DCIS were not included in the study, but I didn't feel I was given client centred care.  Fortunately the consultant at Birmingham was happy to support me. The trial evidenced that targeted radiotherapy to a third of the breast had the same outcome as full breast radiotherapy five years on in women who had invasive breast cancer and targeted radiotherapy produces milder side effects. Obviously I had to share the risk with my consultant as I had DCIS but for me it stood to reason if it had had good results for invasive breast cancer, and given that high grade responds well to radiotherapy anyway, why would targeted not be beneficial for me. Don't know where you are based Maxine but if you are interested it's worth looking into via Addenbrookes. Take good care",

      "Content": "Hi Maxine The most important thing is to get your head in the right space and focus on moving forward. I am getting through it a day at a time, counting down the days as I go and building in nice things to do at the weekends to keep me going.  Be brave and look forward to when your treatment is finished Hope it all goes ok Jane x",

      "Content": "Hi Sharmer.  I am so sorry you are going through this. I had a lumpectomy in march following a diagnosis of high grade DCIS. I am now having radiotherapy. I am also a nurse, in mental health, which hasn't helped me either but what being a nurse does do (whatever branch you work in) is give you confidence to ask questions and put yourself at the centre of your care and take part in making decisions about your care. I have chosen to have targeted radiotherapy rather than whole breast radiotherapy because of risks for my lungs and have had to research around past trials and get my care transferred to a hospital who would offer me the treatment I wanted because of NICE guidelines (which are only guidelines at the end of the day). I am not sure how long it takes for the shock to settle, I think I am still in shock a bit, but for me, giving myself time to think about what was right for me helped me get my head around it a bit x",
