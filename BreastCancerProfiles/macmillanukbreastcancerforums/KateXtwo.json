    "Content": "Hi Bandele.   I found when I was feeling \"a bit under the weather\" that I made sure I had packets of tea biscuits or digestives in the house which helped to get rid of the nausea to a certain extent.   I also took a packet of Trebor Aniseed Imperials with me to the hospital and, when I got the \"nasty metallic taste\" dose, the nurses always told me when to pop one of the imperials into my mouth (they liked them too so I shared - only too happy to).   If you don't like aniseed. peppermint will help whilst you are getting the metal tasting dose.  If you have constipation, try a glass of red wine at night.   I found it helped.   Don't know by your name if you are male or female but, when feeling sick, always thought of the symptoms as having a \"bad pregnancy\". If you are male, just imagine what females go through!!!   LOL.    Positive thinking at all times and never listen to anyone else's symptoms - just do what you feel is right for you.   One important thing, do as your body tells you and rest if you need to, night or day.    Good luck and God Bless. xx",
