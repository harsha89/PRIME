    "Content": "Hi  I found your post by Googling the Cancer head shave issue as they are doing one locally to me to support a local woman and it just doesn't sit comfortably with me. I'm hoping she'll be in recovery in 6 months time and I'm quite sure she doesn't want to be reminded twice daily at school pick-ups of her ordeal looking at people's hair growing back, particularly a child's hair! I have donated to the JustGiving page and giving page and will again but I just find it very showy of people that possibly do not have a clue! Though I myself have been fortunate enough not to have the experience of this!  Is it true alturistic support or is it self gratification and increasing one's popularity in the process I would rather just give what I've got!",
