    "Content": "Hello Debs I'm 5 wks and 6 days post MX, Sent Node and Strattice Mesh/implant reconstruction. Like you I am still getting very very tired and the smallest outings leave me exhausted. I had two WLE's just before the MX and wonder to what extent all of the anaethsetic stays in your system. I had my final drain in until week 4 and had to carry it everywhere with me. I was in pain for weeks too. I am finally seeing an improvement in that the pain is now more occassional discomfort and I get a large seroma under my arm which they have been draining with a syringe. The worst pain was nerve pain in my arm. It felt as though I had a raw open sore (there was nothing there) and even my own hair lightly brushing it felt like the 'sore' was being rubbed with a cheese grater! It is still a little sensitive but much better over the last couple of weeks. I had dihyracodeine and diclafenic for when it was at its worst. I am going to attempt a phased return to work in two weeks time but will be going back off again for another op on my left breast. Either a lift/reduction to match the implant or depending on results from the genetics clinic another MX/reconstruction. Our bodies are extremely complex with miles of nerve tissue no wonder we all have different experiences despite similar operations. I'm pleased for those who are back to normal in a fortnight or so, but from reading these forums know like you I am not alone in having a longer road to recovery. We will get there and our experiences can encourage others who are worried to 'hang on in there' I hope you have a better day today and that your BC nurse has contacted you. Regards Trudie  ",
