      "Content": "Thanks, glad you were ok. I've been joking saying my new boob will add to my buoyancy! My chest wall was radiated so there are a couple of places which are still tender and are likely to remain that way for quite some time, It's coming up to 2 yrs since finishing active treatment and I have to take things slowly as I'm blessed with chronic fatigue. I'm thinking I'll alter an impact vest as I don't want to bump a tender bit if I'm in the water as the reflex is to breathe in!",

      "Content": "I  was wondering if there is anyone who has taken part in watersports requiring a buoyancy aid or impact vest after treatment. I'm returning to windsurfing, but my buoyancy aid is flat on the inside so offers little ergonomic cushioning. My ribs and boob is painful in places (I've had the whole shebang of treatment and have a silicone implant) so needs some extra protection from falling and wondered if anyone else has experience of a 'better fit' brand or if they adapted their own. Any advice greatly appreciated :)",
