    "Content": "Hello :) How about a small MP3 player with some songs / music loaded onto it ? Could be useful for journeys or moments in hospital during chemo treatments when your friend may not always feel chatty. A selection of songs to prompt memories of funny / good / silly times you've shared might make her smile ! You could also use CD's compile some favorites from your time as friends, it's a thoughtful way of showing you spent the time thinking about it and producing the gift when some of the more conventional gifts are impractical. I'm sure you will find all the strength you need to be there for your friend, not an easy time but if you ever don't know what to say .... just say exactly that, she'll understand. Good luck to you both x",
