      "Content": "Dear Yvonne, my first thought when I began reading your email that you are brave to write, but no! You feel safe here and by writing about something so deeply personal tells me you want things to be so different... You have had a year of trauma, of highs and lows along with the continued medication which undoubtedly has an effect... and all this impacts life in deep ways that are not always 'visable' by others and even you have had to dig deep to deal with ...your sex life... Love making with your husband, being a part of this recovery journey....It is clear how much you love each other, and talk which is so important.  From my own experience it was difficult and I felt less of a person with little sexual desire ( but love my husband beyond words) and the first time I  even cried in love making because my husband still 'wanted me' and I suppose that letting go of my feelings...was part of a releasing for me...although he was confused I know...but just reassured and hugged me!!  a lot of the time I would just do it for my husband..although never said that to him!! Yet I know he knew!! .can you have an over night away.. Special for you both? i think it is about relaxing, about clearing your mind and concentrating on each other...sometimes that's hard at home..(from my experience)  if not try and talk together and almost set up a time, I know that sounds clinical...but it works! I found once I began to enjoy sex again, slowly it gets better...  Yvonne, don't fill your days with pressure..make it fun! A kiss! Hug! A touch! A look! A smile! Just giving that little extra of yourself to the man you love deeply will kindle that desire again..in time... It can even be better in the sense you 'know each other better' in the end let your husband love you .. You don't always need to take the lead!!...  I hope something of this email helps .. It might just be one sentence...one word.....and if not ..don't put pressure on yourself...xx  ",

      "Content": "Hi tansy, I have been on anastrasole for six months, (lobular cancer stage one ,grade two) at the start I had terrible hot flushes night and day! (I would loose count of how many in a day) fatigue, I would almost dred going to bed as i felt so awful and i  generally struggling with daily life. As the weeks rolled on I gradually improved, the hot flushes became manageable, i had more energy and felt 'more myself'!!! Then nearly a month ago I collected my anastrasole from the chemist, I noticed that it was a different brand this time 'Accord' which I had read on this forum that ladies had problems with, so thought let's see how I get on!!!!! .well, suffice to say I went to my GP yesterday, i have terrible hot flushes again, especially in the night, then came with that sleep deprivation and generally feeling unwell. My GP is very supportive and listened about the 'Accord' make, so I have seen my pharmacist who has put on my records to have the 'Teva' brand which I felt the best on!  So, yes there are side effects, but don't just accept everything that's given to you, it can be trial and error to find the tablet that suits you, we have to keep in mind that we are on these tablets long term and we are the ones living with the side effects, and we don't need to accept what is given to us without question...  Hope you find the 'brand' that suites you best quickl!!! best wishes AliRalph",

      "Content": "I was diagnosed with invasive lobular cancer through a routine mammogram in June, I had a MRI in July before surgery in early August... I had 20 radiotherapy treatments (five extra as I had pre- cancerous cells in the clear margin close to my chest wall... All apears welL.... i have a first check up mammogram in July .. I have not been offered a MRI scan.. But take comfort from the fact that the invasive lobular cancer was picked up by a routine mammogram.. My treatment has been at Poole hospital...at Poole I won't see a consultant in the follow up but a nurse practitioner which I found a little disconcerting ( all to do with 'value for money' as I was told !!!!!!!!

      "Content": "Hello,  five months from my routine mammogram and my whole life seems to have changed, i liken it to ..walking through a door into another world! One I knew existed (my Mum had breast twenty-five years ago) but it wasn't till I was diagnosed in early June, that I understood that this was about me, not my husband nor my children (who I always put first! Especially my grandchildren) but about me....I never felt so alone as when my husband left me the morning of the operation, as there was no point in him sitting waiting all day!! Now after surgery, hormone treatment, radiotherapy, it all feels strange what next??? Put it all behind me? Pick up my life as it was? But it doesn't feel like that, inside I feel different, sad, more than a bit lonely...my emotions and energy is all over the place!!! But thankfully not angry! I have a long journey to go and as with us all to find that place of peace. so, yes I think this is quiet normal when you think of what our emotions, bodies, minds have and are going through, we need to be gentle with ourselves, and give time for that inner healing to take place.... Then you know what...WE WILL BLOSSOM AGAIN, & have a spring in our step!!!  praying that will be so for you... Xx",
