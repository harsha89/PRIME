To find the full information I am posting a link : http://www.eczema.org/aqeous   I know this is the eczema website, but the test described were carried out on people NOT suffering from eczema, so valid for us. My preference is E45, or Sudocrem, but Sudo has lavender in it, so might not be very good for sore/painful skin. Although it is used on babies bottoms!!",

      "Content": "Hi nuttytart So sorry you have had to join this club  that nobody wants to join. I can promise that once chemo has started, you will find it's not as bad as you expected. I've had two sessions now, one more of Fec, then change to tax for last 3 sessions. I'm not saying it is pleasant, but you will get drugs for the worst side effects like nausea and sickness. Thankfully I haven't had that problem, but in the first few days after I use the anti sickness pills 'just in case' especially if I'm going shopping. As far as hair loss is concerned, the thought of it never bothered me, I'm proudly bald. But the other night I dreamt I put my hat on to go out, when I got back I took my hat off and found I had a head full of beautiful, auburn, shoulder length hair. But when I brushed it, it came out in long thick hanks and lay on the floor around my feet. So what does that say about me then? Incidentally, it won't come out in thick hanks. And if it does start to come out, you will know around day 9 of first cycle, as your scalp will become very tender and sore. But good luck with the cold cap and with chemo in general. Big hugs from Poemsgalore xxx",

      "Content": "Hi Lynne I to am on Fec T, but not bothering with Cold Cap. Don't really know whether you can use it with Tax, but I know several ladies who are using it with Fec, with mixed results. This quote from the booklet on Tax might help: \"Docetaxel causes hair loss. Most people will lose all their hair,including eyebrows, eyelashes and body hair. You may begin to lose your hair about two weeks after the first treatment, but it can happen earlier. Hair loss is usually gradual but it can happen very quickly, possibly over a couple of days. It can sometimes be minimised by scalp cooling. This involves wearing a \u2018cold cap\u2019before, during and for one to two hours after your treatment with chemotherapy drugs. How well the cold cap works depends onthe drugs and doses used, and it does not work for everyone.The hair loss should be temporary and in most cases your hair will begin to grow back a few weeks after your treatment has ended. Prolonged or permanent hair loss has been reported in a very small number of cases.\" Hope this helps you decide whether to use it on Tax or not. Using it for the Fec part  might help you keep your hair a bit longer if it works. All the best Poemsgalore xx",

      "Content": "May I just mention. Aqueous cream is no longer advised to be used as a moisturizer. Just  a soap replacement. It contains a substance called Sodium Lauryl Sulfate. This is what 'Natural News' says about it: \"Sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) is a chemical lathering agent that has come under scrutiny for safety and potential toxicity issues. It is found in a large amount of the products we use every day for personal hygiene and body care. Among them are toothpaste, shampoo, lotions, soap, liquid body and facial cleansers, and more. Sodium lauryl sulfate did not start off as a detergent that was meant for use in consumer products. It was initially sold as an industrial strength detergent primarily used for heavy duty cleaners and degreasers. It is now found in products which are in close and frequent contact with human skin. SLS strips the hair and skin of moisture because of its strong detergent properties. You can actually get your skin, mouth and hair just as clean using gentler, more skin and membrane-friendly substances. There are several fatty acids that work to cleanse the skin without disrupting the delicate acid mantle that protects it from outside elements and toxins. Sodium lauryl sulfate has been identified as one of the primary skin irritants that are used in body care products today. It has the ability to easily penetrate the dermal layers and enter the blood stream. The caustic lathering agent easily destroys the lipid layers that keep the skin smooth and supple.\" poemsgalore",

I had my first mammogram on remaining breast in December 2013, but in January 2014 I had a full breast check where they did a physical check on scar tissue and lymph nodes both beneath my arm and up to clavicle, then did the same to my 'healthy' breast and lymph nodes. But I'm worried about what happens after the five years annual checks. When they put me back on a mammogram every three years? They won't check my affected side then, surely it will be up to me??",

OK, so it's more common among us older lasses (I was 61 when diagnosed) but it does happen to women very much younger, sadly!!",

He told her: \"Breast cancer is just like any other long term conditions nowadays\"! Boy, did I give him a chewing over!! A funnier story. I had a mastectomy with no recon. The first time my dippy neighbour saw me with my (hated) prosthesis in, she said: \"Oh! has it grown back again??\" Doh!",

      "Content": "Hi Cbaz, My cancer was also Ductal Invasive, 100% ER + 70% PR +, HER2 - After my mastectomy and SNB I found it was 36mm, grade 3, stage 2b. Three lymph nodes removed, one with cancer. I was offered chemo but told if I didn't want it I didn't have to have it because of several serious health problems. I took it and got through pretty well considering. I was neutropenic once and in hospital because of it, but my side effects weren't too bad really. I had no nausea or sickness and only had six days in the cycle where I felt a bit rough (wiped out and very flaky). That was last February-May. So don't be too scared if you do have to have chemo. Radiotherapy was my big fear as I have a lung condition. I didn't have any radio but I'm taking Anastrazole now.",

      "Content": "Hi margr20, When you go to see the oncologist (who is in charge of hormone tablet) ask what percentage of benefit you will gain by taking the tablet. My cancer was 100% Oestrogen positive and 70% Progesterone positive, so it was a no brainer for me. I am taking Anastrazole for at least 5 years. Personally, if I was 'in the middle' I would err on the side of caution and still take the tablet and see how I got on regarding side effects.  xxx",
