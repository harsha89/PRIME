    "Content": "Hi,   Really feel for you - it is not easy.  I have not had to have chemo but just about to finish a month of radiotherapy. I have used all my strength to 'keep it normal' for our 5 year old daughter who knows Mum is having 'sun' treatment for the lump removed from her boobie but doesn't know anything more.   It sounds easy taking whatever help is offered but if you are anything like me you may find it difficult to accept.  My husband has been great but no one except ourselves fully understand the emotional drain on keeping it normal.  Children are exhausting in the best of health so try to grab even 10 mins when you can and sit down.  I have let the housework totally slide as just not up to it only do the basics and get to bed once the kids are in bed. Good luck, PaulaM",
