      "Content": "JHi ladies I'm looking for a bit of advice please.  I received pathology results yesterday, the surgeon advised me that all the cancer had been removed from my breast it measured 14 millimetres so quite small however they had removed two lymphnodes as well and they were positive for cancer, I have not been told what grade etc all I know is I need chemotherapy and I will speak with and oncologist on 15th February.  There was no mention of removing the rest of my lymphnodes, is that normal? I just assumed they would want to remove or at least check my other nodes.  I feel like I'm still completely in the dark.  I was hoping to have some piece of mind yesterday.  Thanks for listening, and I hope you're all well.  Kirsteen xx ",

I am sorry everything I'm saying is so vague, I'm still trying to take all of this in, I will defintley take someone with me to my next appointment and I will take notes as I never remember what has been said to me.  Thanks again Kirsteen Xx",

      "Content": "Thanks Julia, I just really hoped yesterday would have brought me some piece of mind, I will contact the BC nurse on Monday and hopefully get some answer.  They also asked me to take part in a trial which is called adjuvent therapy all I know is that has something to do with the lymphnodes.  I feel completely alien to all this. But I'll call them on monday.   Thanks for your reply. Kirsteen xx",

      "Content": "Hi guys so this is 2 years now since i was diagnosed with IDC i completed chemo and radiotherapy and all is well.  I had a Mammogram in November which was clear, however last week I found a small lump in my armpit on the left side where I had my surgery.  I have been to the docs today she examined me and felt the lump and has referred me back to the breast clinic.  I am just a little concerned and hoping it might just be a cyst but she did say she felt it was attached?  Any of you ladies had problems with cysts or anything after breast cancer.  Or maybe new lumps that appeared and have turned out to be nothing to worry about?  Sorry just hoping my mind can be put at rest as i have 10 days to wait before I can see someone.  Not sure I'm going to cope between then and now worrying about it. Thanks Kirsteen  Xx ",
