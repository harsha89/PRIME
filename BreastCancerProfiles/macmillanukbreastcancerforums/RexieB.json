    "Content": "I know exactly how you feel. Following completion of my treatment ,surgery, chemo, rads I had a major melt down. I experienced extreme anxiety issues and was very low. All I can say to you is nothing lasts forever. You have done the right thing ,seeking help . What your experiencing is very common, you are not alone, you only have to see on these forums how many women experience similar feelings. With the help of a very supportive GP, medication , counselling, and the love of my friends and family there is light at the end of the tunnel. I'm a year on post treatment now. Life goes on, it's just different to what is was before, and you have to accept that. I found courage in reading the comments of other brave women on this forum.Â  Be kind to your self, you should be proud , you've come a long way on a hard road, good luck, sending you lots of love xx",
