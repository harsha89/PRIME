    "Content": "I had private chemo and would recommend it. My stints were 6+ hours at a time and I had a very comfortable private room. During this time I took a laptop and did a bit of work, played some games and watched a few DVD's. The chemo nurses would have come to my house if I wanted but I figured if anything went wrong, hospital was the place to be. I wouldn't recommend the hospital I was at though, as the organisation was a shambles; I used to check on bloods and scan appointments that were often not made by the admin folks and make them myself. In some of the rooms there was only tepid hot water, (used to heat up my hands and arms to find veins). Although tea and coffee was always available, lunch wasn't too good, used to take my own after a while. That aside, my scan results and instant access to oncologist was a bonus. Hope yours goes well. Cheers, Mike",
