      "Content": "Hi there This year has not been one of my best. March had a car crash, April was attacked, June finished with my fiancee (he was taking advantage of my good nature), July 1 month after my 40th diagnosed with breast cancer, Sept mum in ITU for 3 weeks untill her cancer (treated as peritoneil in 2007, but they could never find the primary) returned. She had complete kidney failure, and it was in her liver, bowel and lungs. The autopsy showed it originated from her gall bladder. So 1 day last month I had radio 815 then cremated mum 315, not my best day. I finished my 25 sessions of radio on Monday, which included 5 boosts. All through radio ive felt positive, even wearing make up and high boots (well if you cant look good for radio). But today I feel really down. Ive been off work since 5th Aug full pay luckily and return 24 hours a week monday 25th. But I still feel very tired, my boob looks like a plucked chicken, the nipples split. My chest feels slightly sore and tight, when I breath in feels abit tight. If i dont have a day time nap im knackered by 8pm. Im paranoid about any pain, and thinking the good boob hurts/twitches/tingles now, and have been prodding around for lumps (which prob doesnt help LOL). Then under the arm felt prickly, so thought \"oh its in this boob and armpit now) but to be honest I think it just needs shaving.... as its spikey. My backs sore today, so I imagine its in there. Every time I hear the word cancer I jump, I even missread words that beging with C as cancer (ie a christmas film), and if someones star signs cancer ahhhh. Mine was 22mm taken out (inc a margin) ductal, in situ and hormone fulled. It was not in lymphs. My oncologist says shes not a betting women but if she were she would bet on me being OK. BUT I feel that ive been poluted with cancer, will it pop up somewhere else. i dont think people that havent had C understand the poluted feeling. Dare I think about being here in 20 years, am I living on borrowed time. Does the paranoid feeling ever go. I feel bad feeling like this as im sure there are millions of people that would have loved the prognosis I had. I feel deflated today.",

      "Content": "Thankyou for my 2 loverly replies last night, nice to wake upto. I am looking forward to work in many ways, ive been there 13 years. Im doing Mon-Thur 9-4 1 hour lunch. I used to do Mon-Thur 9-530 but mum was my child minder after school. I had to go to mums house yest (5 mins round corner) 1st time ive gone there in 3 weeks, it was terible. I realised that I dont go there or think about her death because it make it \"reality\", instead I think about her life. I was very close to my mum, I brought my twins up since day 1 alone (at 28 got myself in trouble tut tut). She took the place of a partner, in regards to holidays, outings ect. But I know that she wouldnt want me to be sad (something my sister and I who do not get on at all, are not in agreement with). I think my sisters ona guilt trip right now, as I did allot more for my mum, and saw her every day. Although she doesnt have to be on one, because we have to have our own lives. But I dont feel gulity. Also because I had/have cancer, I see things diff to her. I see that mums gone (she was 70) but im still here. And if I can make it to 70 (im 40) i will be well chuffed. I really appreciate life more. Nxt year I will be mortgage free (due to mums house sale and my cancer pay out) the 1st time ever that the twins and I will not be robbing peter to pay paul, and its because of dealth and illness (a sad fact). But im not going to feel bad about that either, im going to enjoy my time with the twins. This cancer, aint gonna get me yet ;)",
