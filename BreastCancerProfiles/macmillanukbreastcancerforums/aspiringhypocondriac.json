    "Content": "I am sorry you have had such a grim time of it.My cancer was genetic.It was caught in my first routine screening when I was 37.It is a harsh part of the illness,not the least becausse of the guilt aspect of handing on your less than wonderful geanes.I am sure you would make a great parent ,one of the things with all this health drama is you do find that even when the odds are hidiously stacked against you it can still work.I think it is good to try and trust your instincts as we are still in the early days of genetic knowledge and there are huge gaps which effectively can only be filled with best guesses.I have lurched from health problemÂ  to health problem untill my mid thirties when they joined the obscure dots and identified cowdens syndrom The brac gene runs in my father family It was breast cancer I worried about which I suppose made it easyer to go for a mastectomy when they found it.Good luck with whatever decesion you make.",
