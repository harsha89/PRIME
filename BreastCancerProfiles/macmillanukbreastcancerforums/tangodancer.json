      "Content": "Hi Ross &Jo (my son's girlfriend and my niece are Jo's too) I'm really sympathetic to your plight and Jo is very young for this to happen.  Good news that it is 'contained'.  I can only give you my situation which may help your decisions (or not). I am 60 and was listed for a mastectomy lfor a grade 3 tumour last month.  Howevver, I opted for a bi-lateral one (both off - symmetry and convenience and I don't want implants), so then the surgeon back-tracked and suggested a wide excision lumpectomy plus 2 nodes (inconclusive result from those at present).  This leaves the nipple and some breast.  Surgery done 2 days ago (monday) and I'll know next week if they 'got it all' and I just need radiotherapy, or whether mastectomy is still required.  Feeling pretty good (came home yesterday) and fingers crossed. I have been clear that I don't want chemo and I think you should do plenty of research on that in advance.  Much more wrecking to one's existence than radiotherapy  as far as I can tell but maybe your sister-in-law knows better.  If your wife has TRAM  etc tell her to be  very careful of not getting any localised infection; woman in the bed opp me had spent 4 weeks in hospital while they tried to put that right. I would read as much as you can and ask questions of your surgeon, and go for what you want.  Cancer is not necessarily a death sentence nowadays and the clinicians want to do a good job too, so everyone should be pulling together.  Check out your local cancer centre too and get advice on how/when you should tell your kids.  Maybe they are too young anyway and won't understand, so better to spare them the stress of Mummy being ill. Keep strong, good luck, hugs.",

      "Content": "Hi Sharon I'm sorry that things are not going smoothly for you.  It's good that you can write about your feelings so clearly afterwards, so there is a kind of diary going on. I've read through most of the posts here between you nad others, and also went for treatment on Monday - lumpectomy and 2 nodes on right breast.  Originally the consultant wanted to do a mastectomy and I said 'OK but can you take both off and get the whole thing over and done with' so then she back-tracked and here I am at half-way house.  Life is full of compromises.  I won't know until 17th if I will need radiotherapy or more surgery but have already said that I won't go for chemo.  My choice. I'm telling you this to reassure you that the op itself is not a big deal, only 24 hrs in hospital, and that your family and friends seem to be doing everything they can to help you through it.  But there's some sort of psychological block  for you and you need professional help to get you through it and to make a firm decision.  Then you will be in control of events.  I may sound cruel here, but you can't go on wavering and taking everybody on this roller-coaster with you when they have their own dilemmas to deal with.  Even the doctors will run out of patience.  I do sound horrible I know, but as I said, I really think you need a professional to listen to the issues, not other cancer sufferers. Talk to your GP and Cancer nurse and ask for psychological support, maybe some CBT during November.  Be strong and be brave, you have the rest of your life to live!",

      "Content": "Hi Anne.  I used to work in a PCT and with GPs and know how the funding works.  If your GP (or GPs) agree to your op then the money comes out of their practice budget.  The PCT just does the transaction.  Go and convince your GP that you need this particular reconstruction for psychological reasons, not just cosmetic. I have breast cancer but am going  for bi-lateral and no implants or reconstruction, but I am retired and a busy gardener so my partner and i are not too fussed if i become a boy most of the time!
