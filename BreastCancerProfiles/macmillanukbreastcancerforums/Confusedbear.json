      "Content": "I was wondering if anyone else is still getting extremely tired after treatment has finished. I was diagnosed with grade three breast cancer two years ago and have gone through a mastectomy, chemo and radio therapy and now I'm on tamoxifen for 10 years. But just lately I've been getting really tired again, which was the only other symptom I had other than the lump when I had cancer. Am I being paranoid, when worrying that the cancer may be back or is it just a side effect of the tamoxifen even though I've been on it for 6 months and this has only been happening for the last few weeks. Is this normal",
