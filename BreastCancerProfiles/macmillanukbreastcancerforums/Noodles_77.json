Anywaaaaaaay. I have a few queries so will keep it short for anyone who can elaborate a little.. * Tell tale signs your hair is going to go even if youve had a cold cap? Hoe long should I wait? * I'm lucky to have a beautician BFF who can tattoo my browsfor brows for me. But she is panicking about threading them to shape 1st? Is threading ok? Will they grow again? * How likely is it my lashes will fall out? Is it practically a definate like my head hair? * Nails need a thick dark layer? Is shellac ok? I used to have acrylics in the past but wouldn't risk that now I don't think! So thats about it. Want to be one step ahead of this if I can? Much live and God bless Helena",

The last 2 washes have shown signs of lots of whisps dropping out. No clumps or anything and not a massive amount when i brush it through. I decided to dye it back to dark brown for my little girl, i figured if its going its gonna go so what the heck. Im going to wait until Thursday night next week before my 2nd FEC on friday 12th to decide if i go for the cold cap again or not. If no big clumps have come out by then, i will go for it again. I really do think that the Aloe Arborescens mixture i am taking is helping a lot too in the way of hair retention and my over all wellness. I feel awesome!x Thank you Lord... XX Noodles",

      "Content": "Hey Ladyb111rd! I am taking the aloe Arborescens! I did my research and bought it from - http://www.aloeone.co.uk/latest/juice-500ml It is 10ml a few mins before each of your 3 main meals every day. I have just ordered my 2nd bottle because I think it may well be to thank for the fact I feel awesome with the chemo. It also helps to maintain a healthy digestive system so perhaps will help with bloating etc for some? I suffered with indigestion and bloating and constipation for just about 4 days, that was all. As far as hair loss, mine is starting to shed quite a bit more than before, however, I am now on day 18 post FEC1, and anything could happen, but I still have stacks of hair and you can't notice any has gone at all. I will wait for the night before my FEC 2 on friday to decide if I will have cold cap or not. Xxx Ps. I had the horrible bruised feeling around a week ago and felt like I had been lashed with a whip across the forehead!hair is dropping a lot more than before but mainly sideburns and round edge a bit maybe because the cold cap didn't really get to those bits?? Down below fell out almost completely on Saturday, that was a funny experience and my eyebrows pluck able with hardly any effort, they just slide out lol!",

      "Content": "Going Going ....not gone yet though but gee wiizzz that's a lotta hair that I just combed out in the bathroom. So my scalp has been itching like a mummachuffa, I have had my hair piled on top of my head in a loose bunch all week. But when I took out my hair and tonight I found a mahusive matted dreadlock in the back of my head! So because I have Afro hair and not sleek straight hair, my hair has been detaching from the scalp with no where to go and just getting caught up in the curls and sitting still. I decided it needed a good comb out before washing it (which luckily I can avoid for days due to the type of hair I have) and stacks came out. I was emptying my hair brush every few strokes and once I finally got the dreadlock out, BOOM, it revealed a big bald bit the size of a chocolate digestive!! So it's a bit drafty round the back now and I have probably half the volume! But I am, for now, able to tie it back to hide it. I'm waiting for the hair loss to be undeniably noticeable and then I will invite my children to shave it off for me. Right, best place for a real hair wig please... Xxx",

      "Content": "Hi there. I had a few questions that have been answered in some way through this post so thanks very muchos! I had my 1st FEC on Thursday 21st after discovering a grade 3 invasive tumor surrounded by a large area of pre invasive... so im in for the chop after my 6 FEC-T and a reconstruction. So I literally have 'trademark' hair. I teach dance and fitness in a lot of schools and my nickname is based on my huge curly afro hair... not sure how they're going to feel about my bandana or beyonce wig lol? So I tried the cold cap on the advice that generally the thicker and curlier your hair is the better the cap seems to work. Buy how do you know your hair is going. Someone said a bruised feeling in the scalp. Mine has been itching a bit... what do you think?",

My eyebrows are like miniature patchy caveman brows at the mo, I'm having semi-permanent tattoo this week with my bestie beautician friend so hopefully no need to worry about that side of things. The contoured make up is a real help as I will be biting the bullet too soon after the cold cap simply extended the life of my gorgeous Afro noodles but unfortunately didn't save them! You look goooorgeous bald, thank you so much for your dedication and time in helping us all to feel better and more confident on the bald side of life. Xxxxx",
