      "Content": "Hi Kipper I hate all the \"being strong\" and \"staying positive\" comments too. Sounds like you've got good support from sis and mum (my mum has been marvellous - my house has never been cleaner!). My husband works away Mon - Fri and I have refused his offer of spending more time at home as he is useless and irritating, but he is still there if I need him of course! I am having private treatment and have had best support from the chemo nurses (At Manor Hosp Oxford) always helpful from draining seroma after surgery (not really their department!) to silly queries about meds etc. Also I have direct email for oncologist who always gets back to me very quickly, so I've no complaints about private care. I spent a couple of days at Penny Brohn centre in Bristol after chemo, I can really recommend it, very calming and great advice as well as meeting and talking to others in the same boat. It kind of helped me get this massive experience into perspective..Check out their website - its all free, marvellous! Good luck and keep in touch! TJ",
