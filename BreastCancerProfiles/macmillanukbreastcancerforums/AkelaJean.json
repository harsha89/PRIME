      "Content": "Scarlettem  Hi Scarlett, I found that theses injections made me ache all over but didn't make me feel poorly. Id describe it like having a cross strapped to your back. It made my jaw, collarbone, spine and shoulders ache. I was taking codeine but didn't find it helped much. Speak to your chemo nurses to see if they can prescribe good pain meds for you. I would start my injections on the Sunday evening and the pain would start creeping in Tuesday afternoon. I found a nice hot bath helped as well. Just remember if you take codeine to make sure it doesn't bung you up. They may prescribe lactulose for you too as constipation is a common problem with codeine based meds",

      "Content": "Hi all, I've just had my 5th out of 6 EC-T chemotherapy cycles and have recently started suffering from hot flushes. The ones during the day are bearable but the ones at night are evil and waking me up multiple times a night and obviously causing havoc with my sleep. Does anyone have any tips on dealing with this. I'm due to start Tamoxifen in the next couple of months and hoping it doesn't get worse. I have bought a chillow which I had forgot I had so ill try that tonight. Any advice would be appreciated xxx",

I realised today that I have on a 13.5 tog feather duvet. I doubt very much that is helping. Clearly I'm cooking myself!!! xx",

I still have one chemo cycle to go and I feel like I just get re tablets added every time. I'm wondering if hypnotherapy or acupuncture or similar would help, actually that's a really good idea. Thank you for the suggestion. Ill call tm tomorrow and see what they say. xx",

I already take EPO but I cant remember if she said to take just starflower or if I take both. Ill have to ask. Ill have a look at the Lady Magnet too. Its all great fun eh!!?? I didn't realise how bad the hot flashes could be but I guess you wouldn't know until you experience it yourself!! xx",
