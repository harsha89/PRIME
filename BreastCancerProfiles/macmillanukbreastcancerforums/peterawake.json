      "Content": "Hi Calador, Thank you for your response. I will indeed keep everyone updated. I really hope I have a reduction in the pain as my hands are terribly painful. A friend who is a Pharmacologist said it's the fillers they use that cause the problems, we shall see! I spoke to my Chemist yesterday and Interestingly, the Letrozole range start at £1.67 and the Femara are £118.00!! How can there be such a difference, and I do wonder how they can make such a drug and retail them for £1.67. Hope your appointment goes ok, it is a benefit to have someone with you, I always feel stronger and more in control if hubby comes with me, on the one occasion he couldn't I felt undermined. So good luck. Best Wishes, Sharon.",

GP had written to my Oncologist saying I had asked for the Femara.  Not sure what Formulary actually means in terms of prescribing.  My painful hands just seem to get worse, so I have decided to fund the Femara for 3 months to see if the pain eases off, if it does I'll probably carry on buying them, although I'm shocked at the price.

We asked him about the shape of it as it was 4.5CM and I'm a 32B size I was scared it was so big and wanted to know whether it was long and thin or round, he didn't answer, even though we asked twice. Then I was worried about SNB missing some positive nodes that might have been left behind, again no answer!  Said I wanted too much detail. Oncologist was more forthcoming with info and easier to talk to but I think its a fine balance for them between frightening you more by telling you all the details or keeping you in the dark to a degree so they are more in control. For me personally I usually like detail but in this situation I move between wanting more info and then thinking it may be best not to know. I really don't think they have all the answers either because Cancer can be so unpredictable and they are constantly learning. Your BCN may be able to help if you want more detail.

I have certainly been through mental torment regarding the Chemo risks for such a low benefit. Had chest Wall RT. Hoping your results come back with good news, the waiting game is awful. x",

It's all a concern BC and every time something changes in the treatment plan its more anxiety. Breast Nurse should be able to answer some or all of the questions you have, if not you could ask to speak to the Oncologist again. Best Wishes.",

I am waiting for OncoType DX Results, already had Radiotherapy to Chest Wall and awful side effects ie Skin was badly blistered which then became infected needing to be dressed by Practice Nurse every other day, however, that's now ok. I'm on Letrozole and Bisphosphonates.   They did Predict Tool with me. It is a concern to me that it was in the Nodes, even though the Drs say it was micro and not to worry!! Best wishes, Sharon.",

I'm ok one day and then the next at an all time low and feeling like I just can't cope. Also, you are not having a Clearance and neither did I, although I asked them if they could go back and take more as I really struggled feeling there might be more micromets left behind, it was a NO!  Are they doing RT to the whole Axilla? I see him every day AM and PM but he's retired from riding now due to hind end Arthritis, so he's walked out in hand!! Regularly told by passers by to buy a Dog, Ha Ha! I also have a Dog but she wouldn't walk out with him. He is so good for me, Horses can calm the soul. Take Care and keep in touch. xx",
