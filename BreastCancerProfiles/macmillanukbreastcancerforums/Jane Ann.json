      "Content": "Hello, I tried to submit this a few minutes ago but don't see it on the forum, so forgive me if it gets on twice! I was operated on for the removal of a breast lump in the left breast and the sentinel node nearly 4 weeks ago. Cancer had spread to that node, so I had a second op 2 weeks later for removal of all the nodes under that arm (one more was affected, the rest clear). I have 2 questions... 1) The breast is still quite swollen and the nipple has retracted into the breast (though it at least now just visible which it wsn't immediately after the op) When asked if it would reappear when the swelling went down my surgeon helpfully said 'wait and see'. Has anybody else had this effect and if so any comments, advice or observations? 2) Because of complications of blood pressure, transfusions immediately after the second op, I didn't get exercises started immediately. I am still very swollen/numb down the back of the top of the arm and in the armpit and the exercise to raise my arm is nigh on impossible as there seems to be a restriction that feels like a rope at the fron to the armpit. Also swelling gets worse during and after exercise which in turn makes further exercise even more difficult. Any advice/comments? Grateful for any help and advice. Jane-ann",

      "Content": "Hi Debbie and April, thanks for your reply - it's really helpful and reassuring to get other people's take on things. I think, now that a few weeks have passed, that the 'rope' I described is just the scar - it's a lot better now, since I've had physio on it and have managed to do my exercises regularly. I found a really good electric razor on the internet...it's tiny - cylindrical with a diameter across the head of about an inch and because it's round there are no sharp edges. From other replies I've had, I think I've been very lucky....I don't have to have chemo and the cancer is apparantly the least aggressive. I hope you continue to do well, All the best, Jane-Ann",

      "Content": "Hello Kate, Many thanks for your reply....I guess you're right and I have to be patient. I have to say I'm confused about these lymph nodes. I was told there was cancer in the first 2 but 'the remaining 10 were clear'. From that I assumed that I had 12 all together and they had taken them all under that arm, but you talk of '18 of 20' and other people talk of 29...Very confusing. I still have lymph fluid (I assume) with , I had assumed nowhere to go, but if they've only taken 12, maybe there are more? A question for the Oncologist when I see her, I guess! My scar is now very solid (it was softening up nicely before the radiotherapy as I was sort of kneading it daily but they told me not to while I was having the radio) - I guess I should go back to that now. It's so helpful to get others' input and experience - many thanks to everybody. Jane-Ann",

      "Content": "Hi Carol, You really do seem to have a confusing schedule - it must be difficult, not just the travelling and finding your way round a different hospital but also having different staff and things....makes me realise I've been very lucky - even parking is easy at Maidstone. I finish next Friday because I have to have 3 'booster' shots of radio. I don't really understand the ins and outs, but possibly because I didn't have chemo and also because of the exact site of the tumour (very close to the chest wall), they feel this is necessary. It's a different technique, apparantly. I had to go and be marked up for it yesterday....my boob looks like a map at the moment! So my actual series of 15 stops same day as yours but I'll then go in for the extra 3. I'll be celebrating when it's over - I haven't had nearly the long run you've had, but quite long enough! I'll be thinking of you on Wednesday and will raise a glass to us both on Friday... All the best, and let me know how you get on, Jane-Ann",

      "Content": "Thank you, everybody, for all your good wishes. It was really strange this morning to hit Tesco instead of Maidstone Hospital! I have to say that the treatment I had there, the surroundings and the cheerful kindness of everybody in the oncology unit were just sonderful...even the parking was plentiful and cheap! I'm sorry to have been so long in getting back to you all - I keep forgetting to check this site...it was nice to find 5 messages today! Could anybody tell my about their experiences with swelling? I asked my oncologist if anything ought to be done about the lymph fluid, as everything I've read and heard says lymphodema should be tackled early. I have nothing down my arm (yet?), but pockets of swelling behind the armpit, down my side and over my breast. It gets worse when I do my exercises (particularly that awful one of creeping my arm up the wall!) The oncologist said to wait until my 6 week check up on Sept 1st, but I worry that, because it's not very noticeable to anybody but me, she doesn't realise how swollen I am. Any comments? Carol, I do hope your scan goes well - let me know when it is so I can think positive thoughts for you. I agree, I'm not the optomistic soul I used to be - can't help worrying about side effects and more bad news, but I think we just all have to be as positive as possible - partly because there's not much point in being anything else! I wish you LOTS of luck and hope you can go on that holiday with a clean bill of health. All the best, Jane-Ann",

      "Content": "Hi Carol, Sorry not to have got back to you sooner - I thought I'd set up the site here so that I get a message to my e-mail address which I check every day to say I if have a message here so that I remember to log in, but I guess I didn't! How is your radio going? I have to have 15 sessions, followed by another 3 because my tumour was very close to the chest wall and they need to be sure nothing has travelled that way. I've had 3; so far so good. I have a bit of 'sunburn' soreness, but not too bad yet and I don't yet feel the expected tiredness. The worst bit is staying still with my arms over my head. The first time, which took longer as they were working out how to position me, one arm went completely dead! Also I have this almost uncontrollable urge to move while it's going on! Poor you, Guy's is a bit of a grim area to get to, but it's the very best, I'm sure, for doing the job. I have to get to Maidstone which is about 3/4 hour drive from here - a bit of a chunk out of the day by the time you've waited etc, but not an unpleasant trip. Let me know how you're getting on, and I'll try to remember to check in here from time to time! All the best, Jane-Ann",

      "Content": "Hello, Jools, Thanks or your reply - sorry not to have got back to you sooner. I like your description of the 'sausage'....mine feels more like a steel bar! The nipple seems a little better but is still very retracted. I think the swelling is so bad that it is just overwhelmed by the rest of the breast and pulled in. I'm hoping that the swelling will go down, but it just seems to be getting worse, particularly after exercises. I'm now 4 weeks post lymph node removal and 6 since the lumpectomy. It's only 3 weeks til I start radiotherapy and I feel I should be less swollen, so I've called the MacMillan nurse and am waiting for her to call me back, more for reassurance than anything else - I don't imagine there's any more she can do than what I'm doing already! I've reached the very-fed-up-and-rather-sorry-for-myself stage. Not good, I know. Am trying to stay positive! All the best, Jane-Ann",

      "Content": "Hi, Carol, thank you for yours - good grief, I can't imagine what having 29 out was like....I only had 12, of which 2 were affected and that's bad enough! Where were all the others?? You talk of a 'strange itch'. I have this feeling, usually after my exercises (ugh!) or at the end of the day when I'm tired, that feels as if there was something sharp in my breast, scratching me from inside. It seems to be getting a bit better now, so I assume it's just stitches being absorbed or some sort of healing going on, but it's horrible. I am staring to feel a lot better, but I still have the feeling that I have a very tight underwired bra whose end has come through the material under my arm and is digging in to me! My lump was underneath, near the chest wall, so I suppose in pulling the remainder down and stitching the nipple has been stretched and inverted. I've seen the nurse who reassures me it will be better but may never come out completely. But I've been very lucky....I don't have to have chemo. I start my radiotherapy the same day as you, but at Maidstone hospital, so I will be thinking of you. All the best, Jane-Ann",

      "Content": "Hello Carol, I just thought I'd ask you if you've come across a thing called a 'chillow'. My daughter found out about it and ordered me one on the internet. It's a sort of thin pillow that you fill with water and it stays cool - not too cold, either. I'm beginning to get the sunburn effect from the radio and I find it very comforting and soothing. I have to take my hat off to you; I can't imagine what it must have been like to have had chemo and then to have to go through all this with the travelling you have to do. You must be exhausted. Are the staff at Guy's nice? I find everybody at Maidstone lovely except the people who actually do the radio process. I'm still very swollen from the surgery/lymph fluid and they seem very puzzled about it, but when I ask them if it's unusual they just sidestep and more or less ignore me. I know they're busy, but at the initial talk I had, they said just to ask if I had any concerns, yet they don't seem to want to know - it's almost as if I was swelling up just to spite them! Like you, I can't wait for it all to be over so I can pick up my life again. All the best, and look out for a chillow if you're feeling a bit burned! Jane-Ann",

I was told about the deodorant in the chat I had before my first session. They also told me to use only the Simple soap and /or body wash and only aqueous cream or E45 cream to soothe the skin. I'm still very swollen from lymph fluid...a couple of pockets under my arm and towards the back. Do you have that as well? You really do seem to have been in the wars. I hope you have a really terrific holiday - I love Greece. Can't seem to persuade my husband to go anywhere, though. Keep strong, All the best, Jane-Ann",
