Provides a little relief! I guess what I don\u2019t understand is if the cancer is only 2 millimetres then why is the actual lump 2 centimetres. Wouldn\u2019t the whole thing be cancerous! Also I think at worst I was expecting him to tell me it looks \u201csuspicious\u201d and then biopsy it rather than saying outright it looks like a \u201csmall cancer\u201d even before biopsy. The dodgy lymph node was a bit of an added surprise too. Thanks again for your calming words. Very much appreciated xx",

My consultant didn\u2019t want to speculate until the biopsy results came back other than to say it looked like a small cancer of 2 millimetres. Which doesn\u2019t make sense now I\u2019m home as the lump I can feel is bigger than that. I probably should have asked these things at the time but brain was too fuzzy.  Also I  think I had an MRI, rather than a mammogram, where they injected me with dye & that\u2019s what picked up the small cancer. He didn\u2019t specify much on my lymph node either other than to say it might be linked to cancer or just my body dealing with an unrelated infection. Wishing you all the best for Wednesday.

      "Content": "Hi i went to my gp last week as i discovered a lump in the left hand side of my left breast. I\u2019ve been conscious of this breast for a couple of months now Since noticing  pre menstrual aching in the breast only recently  but the lump itself doesn\u2019t hurt. GP said the lump was about 2 centimetres, was moveable, and the skin wasn\u2019t tethering so she thought most likely fibrocystic changes but referred me to the breast clinic.  I have had my appointment at the breast clinic . The nurse that examined me thought it was probably a deep cyst & then passed me to a consultant for ultrasound.  Ultrasound showed the lump was solid & therefore not a cyst and then he gave me a contrast enhanced digital mammogram. Consultant said the CEDM appears to show a \u201csmall cancer\u201d on the lump, \u201cabout 2 millimetres\u201d but the rest of the breast is fine. He then did an ultrasound in my armpit & found one slightly swollen lymph node. A biopsy of the lump & lymph node have been taken & I am back at the clinic next week for the results. He said swollen lymph node might not be related. I\u2019ve had sore throat this week & could just be my body fighting that off.  I have a one year old baby & therefore am fearing the worst, especially as it appears the consultant seems to think  it\u2019s cancer already just from looking at the CEDM even before the biopsy results have come in which worries me that this might be aggressive particularly as I\u2019ve had a baby fairly recently.  If anyone can help calm my anxiety and fear I would be grateful. Thanks  ",

What were your initial symptoms? I guess my mind is in over drive because the consultant mentioned that it can be more aggressive in younger women but then kind of laughed it off when I asked if I was going to die. My biggest concern is the swollen lymph node which I wasn\u2019t aware of till the ultrasound as cant feel it. He said he couldn\u2019t see cancer in it on the ultrasound but then biopsied it anyway.   Also don\u2019t understand why the lump in breast is big enough to feel about 2 centimetres. But the iodine MRI showed the cancer as only 2 millimetres and called it a small cancer. Should have asked this at the time but just wanted to get out of there xx",

However when I look online it suggests cysts can be solid and fluid  so god knows! I had the dye MRI after the ultrasound as he said the lump had some unusual characteristics at which point he said yes there appears to be a\u201csmall cancer \u201c about 2 millimetres (I\u2019m assuming in the same place as the lump). So maybe I have a random lump with cancer cells at the tip. It\u2019s a shame I couldn\u2019t have just asked him these things at the time but your brain just goes to mush as soon as the C word comes out their mouth. I have been out today with family to talk it through and it really does help to pass the time at least & get some perspective. Thank you everyone on here for giving me some perspective& context  too.

      "Content": "Hi Kate  sorry to hear of your news but great to hear how you\u2019re coping. I\u2019m clinging onto the doctor calling it a small cancer of 2 millimetre but doesn\u2019t change the fact that the biopsy results could say it\u2019s  aggressive & that theres this bigger lump in there which I assume is part of the cancer. And that this lymph node could come back the same. Just feels like the odds are suddenly stacked against me with little hope. ",

      "Content": "Thanks Bluebell. Seeing oncologist on Tuesday so will definitely mention it. It\u2019s almost like it feels bigger first thing in the morning and then softens after a while. I\u2019m doing ok but had to skip my last Paclitaxel due to all my bloods being too low. First time that\u2019s happened. Fingers crossed they are back up this week as I start 4 EC. So I\u2019m officially halfway through chemo now and glad to see the back of Paclitaxel. Just anxious that the chemo keeps doing it\u2019s job and there\u2019s no impact in me having missed a couple. Hope alls well with you xx",

      "Content": "Hi all. I am halfway through chemo for triple negative breast cancer and wanted to ask if someone has experienced similar to me. At my last check up they estimated my tumour has now shrunk by almost half. I\u2019ve noticed over the last couple days that in the morning it almost feels gristly but then once I get up and about it softens again. Am I imagining it or has anyone noticed similar? Thanks all x",

      "Content": "I remember you saying about the pulmonary embolism. Sorry to hear it\u2019s impacted things but I\u2019m sure they will know a way around it. I bet it happens quite often. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m halfway. It seems like only yesterday I was taking to you before I\u2019d even started. In many ways it has gone quickly but I find it quite stressful having the chemo first as I can\u2019t stop checking the blooming thing. Especially when I\u2019ve missed a chemo it makes me more paranoid. Thanks for your encouraging words xxx ",

There is a triple negative group on here aswell , and although it isn\u2019t as busy as this group i find it can be useful for advice and discussion on stuff that\u2019s particularly related to triple negative. Someone always gets back to you. All the best with your treatment x ",
