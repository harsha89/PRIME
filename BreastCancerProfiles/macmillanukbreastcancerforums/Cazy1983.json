I saw a few women today at the breast clinic who looked terrified before and after they went in and I just wanted to say how amazing I think you all are.  Whilst I was being irrational and paranoid you all tried to reassure me. Thank you so much for all your support and keep doing what u do. How are you all ? thabks caz x",

      "Content": "hi every1 my problems does seem so trivial compared to all of you who are going through this or has had it but I really need some advice . FOr the last week now I have had a sore right breast, quite tender to touch etc. I do wear too small bras so I'm thinking this could be it but wanted to get it checked out. I went to my Doc's and felt all round my breasts and said there was no lumps , just tenderness on my right boob, so he said he thinks it could be a cysts or l fibro something? He told me not to look so scared and he was very confident that it wasn't sinister but to get a ultra sound done just for my peace of mind .  I am absolutely terrified that I have breast cancer . It is keeping me up at night at the minute . I have taken Ibroupen and isles helped with the pain and now my left breast is starting to hurt too . (That would make a normal person feel better surely but not me )  i am so sorry that this isn't no where ar as bad and dramatic as to what you are all going through but I am terrified . I lost my mum 3 months ago to cancer(completely out of the blue) she was fine up until a week before diagnosis .  Just seeing really if anyone has a similar story or am I being just completely irrational .my scan isn't till next Wednesday . thanks caz  ",

The fact that you have all gone/going this and yet can still have me advise is amazing. You are all truly inspiring. I am starting to get pain in my other boob now so am thinking it's probably due to my cycle but after my mum I ain't taking any chances .  Does any1 know if whilst they are doing my ultra sound if they talk tony as they r doing it ? (As in if they c anything)  again thankuou so much for all of your advice . Am I also right in thinking that if this pain goes away or lessens with Ibroupen - then it can't be sinister ?  Caz x",
