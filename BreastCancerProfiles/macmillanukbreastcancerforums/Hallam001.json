      "Content": "I am writing on behalf of my wife who had a wide local excision a few weeks ago. Yesterday she noticed a small pale \"blister\" (maybe 3-5mm but very obvious) on the edge of her nipple where the incision was made. She wonders if anyone else has experienced something similar. We'll be going to the GP first thing Monday in any case but would appreciate any comments. She is also due to see the oncologist next week for her pre-radiotherapy assessment, and we are worried that the treatment might be adversely affected by this change. We are not looking for medical advice from the group, just trying to get things into perspective. Thank you.",
