    "Content": "By Fleet 2 minutes ago Hi, my husband has been taking tamoxifen after breast cancer. He became depressed following treatment and has been taking anti depressents. We are now wondering if the tamoxifen caused the depression. We intend to ask for a 3 month break from tamoxifen to see what effect this has on his mood. Has anyone else done this?  Thanks   Alert Moderator   Edit   Delete",
