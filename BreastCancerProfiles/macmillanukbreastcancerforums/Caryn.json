      "Content": "Thank you so much for your reply Elaine, The drain they have fitted goes into my cut about 2cm wide, if i put a dressing on it doesnt even last half an hour, so while in the house i have a towel held in place by my old bra, Im hoping the flow will abate a bit by the end of the weekend, I have my 2 week follow up app on Monday with my surgeon so im hoping something else can be done, I dont have an infection as yet so fingers crossed. The bcn gave me a whole box of dressings so will try them out when i go out, its hard to keep it dry as its constantly leaking, I had a drain fitted after the node clearance and that was fine, easy to empty but now im emptying onto a towel and have a soggy armpit lol. thank you for your reassurance, it helps to know others are facing the same problems . ",

      "Content": "Hi all I am just asking if any of you ladies had any trouble with full node clearance. Had my op on sept 26th, all went well, had my drain out 2 days later. then i felt awful pressure around the wound site and knew it was a seroma, this was uncomfortable but not to bad, then a couple of days later my cut was seeping a bit so i covered it when i went out, then i was about to get in the bath and the seroma burst through my disolveable stitches, I rang the district nurse who advised me to see the breast nurse next day which i did, by this time serous fluid was pouring out of me & i had to have a folded towel under my arm as a dressing was out of the question. The breast nurse said there wasnt much i could do but wait till it abated, so i went home a bit soggy but ok. The next day my disolveable stitches had dissolved and i had a gaping hole about 3 inches long, I went back to the breast nurse today thinking they would stitch me back up. They told me that they couldnt stitch me up as i was losing too much fluid so they stitched me a drain in, i was told this would take weeks to heal and i would have to catch the fluid in a hand towel strapped to my waist. so i am sitting here really uncomfortable and have to hold a towel under me everywhere i go, has any of you ladies had anything like this ?? I now have my bra fastened round me without my boobs in the cups to hold the towel in place.. I really would be grateful if anyone has any better ideas i could try. ",

I have around an inch of new baby down hair & have ditched the hat, people made me feel uncomfortable in my hat as they stared at me with pity all over their faces, so now i let them stare at my new fluffy very short hairdo and it doesnt bother me 1 bit anymore It would be nice if people could be a bit more considerate as we are going through hell without the worry of being noticable. I am hoping to have a short crew cut for christmas !! Also my eyelashes and eyebrows are coming back which i am so grateful for, I bought the new Benefit mascara, it was pricey at £18.50 but I cant believe how fantastic it is, my new stubby lashes look amazing without falsies, Its definatly worth the money love & Hugs to all you ladies xx",

Im sure you will be fine, keep a diary of your side effects so next time you are prepared and can sort it pout beforehand, let me know how you get on. much love to you Caryn xx",
