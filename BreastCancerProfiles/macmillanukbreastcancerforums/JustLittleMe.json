Did you have any complications during/after surgery? How long did you stay in hospital for? And finally are you completely immobile at the moment or can you still do basic things? Kerry xx I had no complications during a nine hour surgery. Nursing care was outstanding.  I had my op on Wednesday and was home on Monday.  I was out of bed day two in a chair and day three started doing laps of the ward. I was told the more I move the quicker I'll heal.  Getting out of bed was painful to start with, but tell the nurses and they control your pain meds.  I refused morphine after day two as it made me feel so ill and coped mainly with paracetamol and ibuprofen. On two occasions I asked for something more and got tram afoul.  I'm doing my breast/arm exercises everyday and walked for half an hour yesterday, although that was exhausting and I came home for a nap!  There are things I'm not allowed to do like lift a kettle or carry my two year old.  I'm still getting meals prepared for me, enjoying being pampered!  The thing I found most difficult initially was getting out of bed.  I could lie down, but it took two weeks before I could get from horizontal to vertical.  My husband had to pull me up, but I can do it myself now! Good luck with your surgery. Any more questions, I'm happy to answer.  Stay positive, you will get a little better every day.  ",

      "Content": "Wendloui Hi justlittleme I've already started Tamoxifen and so far doing ok but my ocologist has also asked me about zoladex and her reasoning about the injections were if you have too many effects from the lack of eostrogen the injections are reversible, ovary removal isn't, i'm back on the 15th feb to discuss a start date then if all goes well i'll consider a oopherectomy later, i personally don't want to have any more surgery just yet, still trying to recover from the 3 i had last year That's a very good point Wendy. Thank you. Injections being reversible is a definite consideration. I guess if my body copes with injections for a while first, it would cope with ovaries being removed?  Thank you for this insight. ",
