    "Content": "Hello all, in Feb 2014 I was diagnosed with stage 3 breast cancer. The tumour is in my left breast and it  was  37 mm. One month ago I completed 6 chemos, however, the tumor only shrank 6 mm. The breast surgeon gave me both option of mastectomy and lumpectomy. I want an option which cause less scar and less complication. I am very concern how it will look after reconstruction. I am thinking to have implant. I may need radiotherapy for both options. The surgeon says that they won't know whether I need radiotherapy until they operate me. I am very confused and I am very worried. Please help me. Many thanks  ",
