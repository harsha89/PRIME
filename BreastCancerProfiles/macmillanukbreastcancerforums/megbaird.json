    "Content": "CAN ANYBOBY HELPME OUT WITH ADVISE ON EXERCISE TO GET MY BACK AREA MOVING AGAIN. I HAD A LD FLAP RECONSTRUCTION IN APRIL 2009 AND EVERY THING WENT FINE ALTHOUGH THE BACK SCAR HAD A SMALL PROBLEM WITH HEALING IN ONE SMALL AREA. ALAS A NURSE AT MY GP PRACTICE REMOVED THE SCAB WHEN DOING THE DRESSING AND 9 WEEKS POST OP A VERY BAD INFECTION GOT INTO THE AREA AND I ENDED UP WITH QUITE A LARGE OPEN WOUND. IT HAS TAKEN ANOTHER 8 WEEKS TO HEAL. THE PROBLEM IS I WAS NOT ALLOWED TO DO ANY POST OP EXERCISES AND AM NOW LEFT WITH A VERY HARD AND STIFF BACK. ANY SUGGESTIONS WOULD BE GRATEFULLY RECIEVED. JUST IN CASE ANYBODY WAS THINKING WETHER OR NOT TO HAVE A RECON I CAN RECOMMEND IT. THE WAY I FELT ABOUT MY BODY AND THE WHOLE CANCER IN GENERAL MADE ME SO DEPRESSED THAT UNTIL I HAD MY RECON I COULD NOT MOVE ON. NOW I AM A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PERSON TO WHAT I HAVE BEEN FOR TWO YEARS. MY HUSBANDS COMMENT WAS \" I HAVE MY WIFE BACK\". FROM THE MOMENT I CAME ROUND FULLY THE DAY AFTER MY OP I WAS LAUGHING AND RELAXED FOR THE FIRST TIME FOR AGES.  NO PAIN AND A LITTLE DISCOMFORT AND THAT I COULD PUT UP WITH BUT I DO NEED TO GET SOME MOVEMENT IN MY BACK AND SHOULDER AREA. i AM 63YEARS OLD AND HAVE NO FAMILY NEAR ME BUT MY LIFE HAS NEVER BEEN BETTER. I WILL NOT LET CANCER TAKE ME OVER AGAIN WITHOUT FIGHT ",
