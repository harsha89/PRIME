      "Content": "Hi, I'm new here but not new to breast cancer. After almost 2 yrs in remission after a lumpectomy I've been diagnosed with cancer in the lymph nodes under my arm. This is still classified as breast cancer. My question is has anyone tried or heard of anyone trying HIFU (High Intensisty Focused Ultrasound) for breast cancer? I know it's now used in the NHS for prostate cancer & sometimes kidney.  I know the NHS don't use it for breast but wondered if anyone had heard about it being used in this country privately or even in Europe. I want to avoid another op if at all possible and better still chemo! Many thanks",

      "Content": "Hi Kate. I did actually ring up the support line & they said to ring various private hospitals which I did - unfortunately the hospitals I rang did not do it for breast cancer. The support line also said to post a question here! Thanks again for your suggestion. Best wishes Diva    ",

      "Content": "Hi George & Jackie I think I came across the same info - I've had info overload when googling! I know it's to treat a single mass but didn't know it was no to lymph nodes (wonder why?). I'm sure it will become the norm in future as there have been successive trials in China on breast cancer. Can't see me traveling to China though! I guess I realised that it won't replace chemo & am trying to find something that might - but don't hold out any hope for that. Many thanks for the link - I'll certainly look into it. Best wishes    ",
