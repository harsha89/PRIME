      "Content": "Hi, thank you so much for your message. I have been trying not to run to the letterbox! Usually I let my little ones bring me the post so I\u2019ve even been ruining their fun.  I can\u2019t believe you had such a long wait. I understand we need time to heal in between the op and therapy but didn\u2019t think it would such a long wait. I hope you were able to enjoy your Christmas knowing treatment would start in a couple weeks.  I was supposed to be on holiday from next week but my surgeon advised me not to travel. I was hoping it would have taken my mind off of the wait but now I am just torturing myself. Just trying to remember that I\u2019m not the only one waiting and there are unfortunately many of us due for treatment. I can\u2019t fault the NHS so far! Just have to have some faith and a lot more patience  xx",

Trying to be patient but thought I\u2019d try my luck here. Can anyone say how long they waited for their treatment to start? Or at least when they were informed about it?  Thank you, ",
