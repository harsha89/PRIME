    "Content": "Hi Worried Hubby, I can only comment on my own experience as I had one large lump 4 cms in diameter in small boob, I had mammogram, ultrasound and biopsy one after the other in same day and was told that day I had breast cancer!  It was a great shock and very upsetting!  I've been having chemo for last 3 months to reduce size of lump so hopefullY I won't have a masectomy, all going well and lump has reduced in size quite a lot so fingers x'd! My partner has been great, been extra loving, patient when I'm in tears, boosting me up by makng me laugh when I feel down!  Losing my hair has been hardest part, you feel like you've lost your identity!  I've got a great wig but still don't feel like 'Me' now, so your wife will probably need lots of love, patience and a good sense of humour to get through this, try and listen to what she feels, sometimes it's a lonely journey as nobody can feel how you feel, but she can come on here and talk to peole going through same thing which is great. You will need to be able to talk to someone about your feelings about this so hope you have good close friends you can confide in but dont' forget to talk to your wife, tell her how you feel, I'm sure you will both get through this and I wish you both all the luck in the world!  It has made me and my partner a lot closer, I think it's because you can't help taking people for granted when you've been together a long time, this has made us realise how lucky we are",
