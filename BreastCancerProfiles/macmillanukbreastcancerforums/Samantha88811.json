      "Content": "Hi ladies, new to the group and just looking for some advice.  I went to my doctor 12 days ago as I've been bleeding from my nipple for around 4 weeks now and have a long hard lump directly behind my nipple.  My doctor said he'd put in an urgent referal and i'd be seen within 2 weeks.  I didn't hear anything after a week so phoned the doctor surgery to chase it up only to be told that the doctor had put the referal through in error as a routine appointment.  The receptionist resent the referral as urgent that day (Thursday).  I haven't heard anything yet and just wondering how long it usually takes from referal to getting your appointment letter.  Feel like I'm stalking the postman!  The bleeding did stop briefly for a few days and I was leaking clear fluid but it's went back to bloody which is understandably freaking me out.

      "Content": "Thanks for your reply, I'm usually totally not a worrier in the slightest but I literally can't get it out my mind which is just making me feel worse.  Im working all day tomorrow unfortunately but I do plan on going to the surgery on Thursday and hopefully getting it sorted.  I'm so angry with my doctor!
