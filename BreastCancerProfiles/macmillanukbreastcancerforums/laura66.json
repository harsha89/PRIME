    "Content": "Hi Rosiero I joined the forum about 11 days ago.  i was diagnosed on 2nd October, but was due to go on a two week holiday the day after. I'm hoping my surgery is on 17th November, pre op is next Monday.  I joined the forums for support and have been helped and guided so much to make decisions that are important for my future.  People have been so kind and helpful to me on this forum and you are right that it does help speaking to someone who is going through it first hand. I'm triple negative and so will need chemo and radiotherapy afterwards.  I'm guessing that once I come to that hurdle I'll be postyin many questions again Good luck with your surgery,  Laura x ",
