      "Content": "Thanks everyone. I suppose that the condition is irreversable threw me but I guess I can manage the sleeve if I have to. Many of my clothes are too tight on the arm for comfort at the moment but hopefully it will get better. My shoulder is killing me too so I hope something can be done about that. Haven't worn my wedding rings for months. I am worrying about flexibility when time comes to have radiotherapy as I am so stiff on that side but I hope they can sort it out. To think that this time last year I was blissfully unaware of what was ahead! Andrea x",

      "Content": "I have now been referred to a specialist. Whilst I was warned this could happen it has shocked me just how much my arm has changed shape and now my hand has also swollen up. Will be fitted with a compression sleeve but any advice would be appreciated on reducing affects. I was hoping to dodge this one but looks like my arm is going to be a problem now. Also next t chemo postponed due to having yet another tooth out this week so I'm pretty fed up!! I am trying to keep my spirits up whilst my body is falling to bits. I don't really recognise myself in the mirror anymore. Sorry just feel like a moan today Andrea x",

      "Content": "Thanks londonlass. I guess it's one more thing to stress over. I am trying hard not to over think it but your right it's another reminder of the cancer. It's interesting that heat brings it on given the warm weather recently. Does that mean holidays to the sun in the future should be avoided?  I have found a practitioner locally who specialises in manual lymph drainage so will give it a try. Did you try this? Thanks Andrea x",

Nausea is really OK and manageable with meds during the day but I take last tablet at 7pm then OK till bed. Once I get there I can get to sleep OK but then wake up 4 hours later with upset tummy and sick feeling. Any ideas please as I am a grumpy lady at the moment. Thanks",

      "Content": "Hello ladies. The ups and downs are driving me crazy. I was so relieved to finish the chemo and felt I was moving forward on to radio then bang my world has fallen apart again.  Last year my husband got through both prostat and testicular cancer before I was diagnosed and has been my rock through this.  His outcome was very positive as both cancers were caught early and operations to remove successful now we found out it's back and we are facing more surgery and chemo. We are devastated and the \"what ifs\" feelings are back again. I am just so sick and worried again. Just when you think there is light at the end of the tunnel we are back to square one again. I will have to pull myself together now again which I know I can. Just need to share this as we have all been there. ",

I have felt from day one that everyone on breast care team was on my side and I have put my treatment and care in their hands. About to start chemo which I am dreading but looking to the future with positive thoughts. My mother has recently passed away with terminal liver cancer which unfortunately they couldn't cure but she would have given anything and done anything to stay with us. She gave me the determination to fight this. ",

It has wide shoulder straps and more importantly a wide support round the side as if you are having lymph nodes removed you will have also have some swelling which will be cushioned under band. I also went one side larger is 40g as you won't want it too tight around you and you will find it hard to fasten for a while. I also work in an office and no way was I going back to work braless to scare the customers! You will be fine once you get your head around it. The waiting is horrible but you will feel so relieved soon x",

      "Content": "Hi try womanzone.co.uk as I found this was the only site I could order larger cup sizes. They have a good range of comfy post op bras and you can say which side you need the pocket. I also had left side MX early December and whilst it is mentally a hard process once you accept what's going to happen you can come to terms with it. I also looked at scar straight away and it wasn't too bad. You will definitely be better with front fastening blouses flowing down.  As a G  cup myself front fastening clothes really helped in the weeks after surgery when wearing a bra was impossible. Accompanied by a pretty scarf you can get them cheap in charity shops gave me a feeling of privacy down the front.  Also bought lots of ladies vests which I actually stepped into and pulled up my body as no way could I lift up my left arm for quite a while.  As others have said be kind to yourself and take little baby steps one day at a time. Good luck. Andrea x",
