    "Content": "Hi Joanna Good idea to get organised while you're still strong and like you I got evrything you have got which proved really useful. My chemo for lymphoma advised no soap - but shower gel is fine, and aqueous cream is a good cleanser/moistiser. I also got crystal deodorant that is fine, and you'll need more thn one toothbrush to last the duration. I went wig shopping before I lost my hair,as hair loss was 100% certain, and was glad I had done so while advisers could see my 'normal' look & colouring to match. I could order but didn't have to commit to buy at that point. That said, I've only worn it once as it was very hot and I prefer scarves - silk or cotton. A stretch cotton turban or two was useful when it came out, and I had had it cut short in readiness. Food -wise, I was told to eat anything I wanted - just keep the calories going in as much as possible. If you don't have much support, I'd stock up the feezer with ready meals, as fatigue has been my biggest problem so energy for cooking/shopping is in short supply.Only other useful purchase I can think of is a thin wrap/dressing gown and slippers in case you do end up in hospital. Best of luck, and keep us posted! Hilary",
