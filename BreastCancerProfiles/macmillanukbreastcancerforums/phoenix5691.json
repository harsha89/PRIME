      "Content": "Hi Gillie my nails were always quite long so I used nail hardener all the time, even if I didn't put nail polish on them.  It just made them look better. I used all different colours of nail polish but never used black.  I had not heard of using dark colours until months after I started chemo. In the end my nails went an orange colour, then purple (like they were bruised) then pure white.  It looked like the white of my nail went half way down instead of being on the tip.  Now 2 months after chemo and 1 month after rads finished the white bits have snapped off.  Now it looks like I have bitten my nails all my life! It all happened very slowly over months and is on my right hand more than my left.  My left hand looks like it is just starting and I can see it going the same.  My big toe nails are like that too.  As for my hair (I am 51 now) it started to fall out on day 14 after chemo and it was a mess so I shaved it off.  I was really worried about losing my hair before I lost it but when I shaved my head it was such a relief.  I didn't have to worry about dropping food in the pot when cooking or leaving clumps around the house.  I wore scarfs when I went out during the day and bought a wig through the hospital which I used when I had the occasional night out.  I now have hair all over my head again and people say I am rocking the JessieJ look.  It started growing in pure white but now has a little bit of brown in it (but mostly grey). At the end of the day both my nails and my hair will grow back.  I may never get it coloured again as I think I have a chance to non damaged hair again at my age why do I want to cover it in chemicals.  I will wait and see how it is when longer and can be styled. My eyebrows and eyelashes are back too. My eyelashes came in better than before so please with that.  Good luck with your treatment.",

      "Content": "Hi jmp i have lymphoedema in my breast.  It is not in a pocket so cannot be drained. It is between layers of skin.  I get MLD (manual lymphatic drainage) massage twice a week but had to wait almost 10 months for my referral. I started seeing the breast nurse having my arm measured every so many weeks but my breast was like a bowling ball - very hard, heavy and round.  It was very uncomfortable.  Now I use kinesio tape which i keep on for 3 days at a time.  It dries your skin out so i then have a few days off before putting it on again.  I have padding which I can only describe as looking like bubble wrap which goes under my normal bra.  Then I have a lymph oedema bra that i wear over the top of my normal bra.  I can say from experience that the MLD massage makes an instant difference every time.  It does come back but it is getting better.  The aim is to get down to one MLD per week and then once it is under control I will get one every 6 months or so.  Ask your nurse for some of the padding.  I have big breasts and it makes my boob look like a golf ball with lots of dimples but my nurse said that is good.  If I can help with anything else just let me know.  Good luck",
