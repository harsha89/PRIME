      "Content": "Hi Joanne My diagnosis is very similar to yours, I had a mastectomy (and node clearance) in August and have just had my first the chemo session. My Oncologist told me to consider the Op a success and that the treatment now is about making sure it doesn't come back. I have 5 more to go, then radio and 5/10 years of Tamoxifen.  My aim is to get through this as best I can and then put it behind me - make good and healthy choices, appreciate all the positives (family and friends have been amazing) and live my best life. I take great comfort from all the women who have gone through this and come out the other side.  Sorry for the early morning waffle but I just wanted to let you know that you're not alone and you will get through it. All the best!",

      "Content": "Hi Joanne Right breast only with reconstruction.  It was originally diagnosed non-invasive DCIS and they weren't expecting to find anything in the nodes but, lo and behold, there were also invasive cells in the breast and 11 lymph nodes. So after mastectomy and clearance, CT scan was clear which was an absolute massive relief. The Op itself was OK and recovery was straightforward enough, just gave myself over to it, if that makes sense?! I just need to get through treatment now and out through the other side. The surgeons and nurses (all the NHS staff) have been brilliant and people on this site are very supportive. Ask as many questions as you like, there's always someone to help and it demystifies the whole thing. Take care x",

      "Content": "Hi Scaredgirl34 Its an awful shock and a worry I know and there are so many things that run through your head.  I am in a similar situation to you, I had a mastectomy in August and it went from non-invasive DCIS to having 11 positive nodes and finding both invasive and non-invasive cells in the breast tissue.  I am also HER2 positive which means its hormone dependent and its classed as level 3 because its travelled to the nodes.  However, the oncologist told me to consider the mastectomy a success as the nodes and breast were removed which means I am now cancer free, all the treatment I am about to have - chemo, hormonal and radio is about making sure it doesn't come back - so that's how I am dealing with it.  To my mind, being hormone dependent means that its linked to age (I'm 50), fitness and weight (not very and I am over), too much work related stress over the past year or so and drinking more than is sensible - these are all things I can change and work on once treatment is over so means that I have control from here on in.  Also, as a result, and because there's no history of it in my family,  I don't think there is a high probability of passing it on to my daughter.   Everyone's diagnosis is different and we will all deal with it in our own way.  Try and take some comfort from the fact that so many women are dealing with this at the moment, are coming out the other end and getting on with their lives.  You are on the right path and will work your way through it. All the best wth your journey xx",
