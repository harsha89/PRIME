    "Content": "Hi everyone, I'm wondering if anyone else has experienced anxiety as a result of taking Tamoxifen. I've been on it for three months now and thought I was free from side-effects. However, I've recently become aware of increased levels of anxiety. I thought it was down to the pressure of work and having too much to do but I've just been away for five days and the feelings have got stronger rather than lessened. I feel 'nervous' all the time and have noticed a dip in my confidence. I really don't think I'm imagining it. I've no previous history of mental health issues so can only put my feelings down to my hormones. There's no ebb and flow which would come with genuine nervousness. The feelings are just 'there' and won't go away. It would be helpful to know if anyone else has had a similar experience. KÂ ",
