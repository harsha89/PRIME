    "Content": "Sorry you're in this position Suzy.  I saw a genetics team as was referred for regular screening at 30 due to my mums early BC. I don't know my dads side at all and only my mum had BC so they weren't able to test me - she had passed away 3 years before (after a long remission she had bowel cancer).  I guess all you can do is go by your current diagnosis and hope that you stay clear. I don't think genetics would show up any chance of reoccuring cancers, though I may be wrong. I remember being shocked on my mums death cert that they put down the BC as the underlying cause. Even though she was 20 something years in remission.  Good luck and keep fighting, x ",
