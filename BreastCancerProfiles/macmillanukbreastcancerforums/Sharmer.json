      "Content": "... thank you everyone for your quick replies.  I am a nurse, so this is possibly contributing to my anxiety, horrible to find myself as a patient. I haven't told my girls yet, so was going to go to the appt next week on my own. Feeling quite sore from the core biopsy and its bleeding a little.  From what I can remember today, radiographer said lump approx 15mm with calcium deposits spread approx 8 cm.  couldn't see any lymph node involvement. However, the lump is in the upper inner quadrant  at 11 o clock, so I am a bit nervous about the lymph nodes close to the breast bone, I am sure these cannot be tested? Not sure   Thank you again for your kind replies, I am determined not to wallow in self pity, I just want the biopsy result to know exactly what I am dealing with and get on with treatment, going to be a long 7 days. Much love x",

      "Content": "Hi everyone x Thank you all so much for your kind replies, it really does mean a lot.  Well attended my appointment today for results of biopsy....... Grade 2 idc, booked in for mastectomy 13th July, and then straight onto chemo.  Biopsy revealed HER2 positive so straight to chemo after surgery, not sure yet about RT.  Unable to have reconstruction at this point but will be referred to whiston (sp) when recovered from treatment for DIEP reconstruction. Any advice, because I am still totally shell shocked! Just don't know what to do :-( x",

      "Content": "Hi all, I am new to this site and looking for help and support.  To cut a long story short, I found a lump in my left breast 2 weeks ago, I am 51 single parent with 3 beautiful girls and one beautiful grand-daughter Attended breast clinic appt today, surgeon said he was extremely worried as soon as he examined me.  Had mammogram, ultra sound and core biopsy.  Been told he is 99.9% sure I have invasive ducal carcinoma.  Got appointment next Wednesday for results of biopsy and treatment plan.  Breast care nurse also said I could be given a date for surgery next week. I was sort of expecting this, but it has still come as a shock, and looking to chat with anyone in the same position, feeling really shell shocked to be honest. Love to everyone and than you if you find the time to reply x",

      "Content": "Thank you toxophilite, just read your profile, I too found mine on a bank holiday weekend! The extra testing is definitely giving me the wobbles purely because I believe the upper inner quadrant doesn't tend to travel to the axilla.   I am an orthopaedic nurse so my BC knowledge is fairly limited really apart from the obvious. Do you think I should mention my worries about the breast bone lymph nodes? Part of me wants to but the other half doesn't X",
