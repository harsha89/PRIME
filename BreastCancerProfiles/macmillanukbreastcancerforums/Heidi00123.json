      "Content": "Hi all, im 32 and on 5th August I found a breast lump as I turned over in bed. I was diagnosed 2 weeks later with invasive ductal carcinoma grade 3 after ultrasound and biopsy. One week after that I had a WLE lumpectomy and sentinal node biopsy. Today I returned to clinic to face my results. Thankfully I had clear margins and node clear. The consultant informed me I am unusual as they found its Metaplastic triple negative cancer. She seemed quite upbeat and told us to celebrate (not sure about that one!). This is quite rare and doctors don't know much about it. This freaks me out a bit as I'm concerned they won't know how to treat it. The plan is for 6 cycles of chemo then radiotherapy. I will meet with oncologist next week. I would just like to know if anyone has this rare type or can enlighten me on it. The Internet has limited info on it and all seems very bleak!! Thanks for reading, Heidi x",
