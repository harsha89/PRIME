If your are post, maybe they can switch you to one of the aromatase inhibitors or, if you are pre, have they considered the possibility of putting you on Zoladex? . If still this drugs got the same side effects in terms of cloths, I am wondering if they could prescribe you and anticoagulant.    Good luck xx",

      "Content": "Wildbeast!!!!!! About the symptoms after surgery yes, sadly, I have to say I am experiencing unwanted side effects. During the two first months, I was quite low, I event burst into tears when I went to the gynecologist follow up. Tiredness, this has always been an issue for me and, I have to say it has worsened considerably. Also, memory loss.   About my bones and joins I can't tell just yet, I am having a bone density scan on the 18 so, let's see.   .... And Ruby, just spot on!!!, I think the same as you. Actually, it something that really concerns me. The long term side effects are really looooooong, maybe chronic. I find very harmful and misleading not to pay attention to them and just to try to push cancer patients into an unfeasible per-cancer routine. This just bring stress, health deterioration  and poor quality of life. Personally, I am tired of being referred to complementary therapies, being really sceptical myself, I find them useless. I think than more research on bc treatment long term side effects, medication for it and financial help it's needed. I was thinking of creating a discussion group for it as a possible way of bringing more awareness to this problem.",

Although my periods stopped around 6 years ago due to the chemotherapy and they haven't returned, according to the blood test, I did not have a clear menopausal status. I finished Tamoxifen on feb and, I was hoping to go on to Letrazole but, my oncologist didn't advice this as my hormonal status was unclear. I decided to have a bilateral salpingo oophorectomy and now I've been put on Letrazole.",

I did a lot of research myself to support my decision. I did not find any thing. I had to have and ovary removed due to a cyst so, anyhow, I had to go to the theater, (what strange name for something it has nothing to do with the entertainment industry), so, I decided that once in there I better had my ovaries out.   I don't know if this help, I guess it doesn't because I am still confused myself. ",

Right now, and after a scared of lung mets, (which turned to be nothing), on October, but I am completely shattered, I feel impossible to deal and cope on \"normal\" basis with the fact that:   1) Breast cancer is unpredictable and, after going through a grueling treatment, all what I got is \"remission\" or \"no evidence of desease\" 2) The fact that I am still dealing with fatigue 3) As many young women, I was misdiagnosed, and I have faced uncountable problems with the health professionals during this 6 years so, my trust is completely broken. I don't believe health professional are on my side at all. I have seek therapy, I have started counselling which I don't find useful and I am waiting for CBT therapy.   I believe I have PSTD. I guess ii's a matter of adjusting to my new normality. I think that conventional standards of  what is common and ordinary need to change to accommodate the variety of true human experience, where death and illness are just part of it.      ",

Well, I had the scan last Thursday and my appointment for results was the 2cd of November. Just 1 hour ago I got a call from the hospital moving forward my appointment to this coming Weds because they cannot see me on the 2cd. My first thought was \"Oh my God/ess I am dying!\", so I asked if this had something to do with my CT scan the results and the lady on the phone told me that they said the results would be available on Weds morning and has nothing to do with it. Obviously my heart beating is rising by the minute and I am quite shaky as I remember a similar experience in the past. What do you think?, have you ever been called to put forward your appointments because they showed cancer, mets or whatever? xx   Wild",

I noticed a lump and, on a regular consultation with my gynecologist, I mentioned it to him. He couldn't feel anything and concluded that, it was noting. 6/12 months later the nasty surprise unfolded and,  my worst fears become alive.  I was very difficult to deal with the dx. I had neoadjuvant chemotherapy  to try to have a less invasive surgery. After a few chemotherapy sessions, I requested a meeting with the surgeon to discuss my options and, she told me that, in multifocal cancers the protocol was mastectomy. I was very upset and, I felt let dow by the medical team. I was told that neoadjuvant could boost my chances of having a less invasive surgery and, after that meeting the surgeon told me a different story. I requested a transfer to  the Royal Marsden Hospital and, the consultant offered me a WLE, he said that my tumors were all within the lower external quadrant so, he could try although with no no guarantees that I had to undergo further surgery. Everything worked very well and I managed to save my breast. I am very pleased with the results although I have body issues after all.  I don't know if I can be of any help to you but, if you think you feel like talking to me don't hesitate to contac   xx ",
