      "Content": "hi my mum is taking letrazole, put is getting a lot of aching/pain from it to the point of her being in floods of tears.  i don't know what to do to help!!!  she takes paracetamol, but this doesn't even touch it sometimes.  she is unable to take ibruprofen due to having previous kidney problems, so cant go down that route.   she did say after having the most horrible experience from FEC chemo where she had side affects that werent even in the books (well she is very special!!) and have to have the chemo stopped that she wouldnt mind the pain from these tablets as it would be nothing compared to the pain she had from that - she has since changed her mind and considering stopping the tablets completely, which i really dont think she should do. has anyone else experienced this or had loved ones experience this?   any help would be so much appreciated, as yet again i'm on the side lines feeling completely helpless again as i dont know what to do!! thanks nia xx",

      "Content": "Hi Helen Thanks for replying! I have suggested this to her, would seem like the most sensible thing to do.  We are looking into the different brands too as I have read quite a few peoples posts on here that a different brand has made so much difference to them -   will def be giving this a go I think. Thank you for the advice Nia",

      "Content": "Hi Pat Thanks for the reply! My mum went to her gp this morning and they have changed the brand of her tablets. She has to monitor how this goes for next few weeks and if no better go back. She has been taking them since about July last year. They also said to take paracetamol and codine to help with the aching/pain - the codine especially at night to help her to sleep a bit better. She also uses a heat pad on her shoulders etc and ibuleve gel on her joints etc when they get bad, and of course a good old fashioned hot eater bottle too- they mayhelp you too if you haven't tried them already? She said she can put up with the aching in her legs to a point, it's her arms/ shoulders/ wrists that are getting her down at the moment :-(. She also says it comes and goes, and that the warmer weather helps. Hope you have lots of lovely people around you to help keep your spirits up?! Nia Xxx",
