      "Content": "Hi Gnj THANK YOU FOR YOUR REPLY ...you have answered my question very well, so even if they do a biopsy, it doesn't  mean i need to think about what sort of treatment i might have to have or that i need to think about finances .... see with me i need to know in my mind what steps i need to take to help me get through anything .... so i won't panic if they need to do a biopsy xxx ",
