      "Content": "Hi Noj, I had 15 treatments one every day. Your skin does go red and you will need to apply the aqueous cream regulaly. My nipple went crusty approx 2 weeks after I finished my treatment and the scabs just came off in the bath they were not sore, under my breast was open because of the burns and I was given a mild hydrochortozone cream, this helped and my breast is back to normal, although it does feel like sandpaper but my oncologist said this would go with time. i finished my treatment on the 21st february.  good luck Caron x",
