My way would be if you are going to wait until morning give your BCN a ring for advice as my breast was sore when I saw oncologist a fortnight ago and he told me no radiotherapy till I was less sore . If your really unwell go to A&E tonight but looking at time and knowing how long the wait it could be morning before your seen .Sorry I'm not more helpful but wanted to answer you as you must be so sore.

With removing so many lymph nodes although very glad I don't have to have chemo but see on here some only had a few removed but have to have chemo .I'm having radiotherapy in February so know what they doing but praying cancer won't come back after having so much of breast removed as tumour was in nipple and so many lymph nodes.

The staff were brilliant and gave me a tabbard to wear until treatment finishes so can wear it under a jumper so won't have to get undressed every time . Started chatting to a few ladies so although out of house a long time made time go faster . Good luck all on RT this week xxxxFran",

I finished my radiotherapy yesterday and happy its all over as the journey back and for was the worst part of treatment as out of house 5 plus hours . I'm a little sore but that will clear up soon . I also saw my oncologist who has taken me off Letrozol and am now on tamoxofen so hope I won't have so many aches on them .I met some lovely people there who I will keep in touch with.It really wasn't as bad as I thought as if hubby hadn't been I'll and I lived nearer hospital I would have sailed through it. Hope your all near the end of your treatment .ones who have finished well done and ones near end it is all worth it Fran xxxxx",
