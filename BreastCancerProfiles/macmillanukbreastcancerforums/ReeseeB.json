    "Content": "Hello. I have suffered from chronic neuropathic chest wall pain ever since my bilateral mastectomy in 2005. I have tried acupuncture, physical therapy, meds, ice, TENS unit, and injections but unfortunately nothing has helped so far. Wondering if anyone on the board has had any success with alleviating the symptoms of PMPS? Thank you",
