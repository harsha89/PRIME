      "Content": "HI all. Im 20 years old and I had tests on tuesday on a lump in my breast which had been there for 7 years to find out if its malignant (find out results on tuesday). However I am in agony when trying to sleep. I cant lie on my left side at all as it puts pressure on my lump. I also cant not wear a bra, for again its too painful. Even for gravity to pull it down. Is this anything I should worry about or go back to the doctors? Or does anyone have any advice on what to take for the pain (not co-dymal or co-codimal) Â as I literally cry every night because im in pain and cant sleep from it Thank you - Georgia",
