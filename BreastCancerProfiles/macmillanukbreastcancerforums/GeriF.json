      "Content": "Day One done ...  Most of you know how terrified i was but you know what,  it was ok. The staff here at my hospital are fab & there's a lovely relaxed atmosphere. I'm cold capping & that was the worse bit. Apart from the added time, i had a constant headache but i coped. Had my hickman line inserted too before chemo so a bit battered & bruised but onwards ...... Hopefully the SE won't be too bad. Good luck to those starting over the next few days. You'll be fine!

      "Content": "Hi Skye01, sorry for delay responding. I'm 2 days in from having the line inserted. During the procedure you will feel some tugging but keep your eyes closed & try to relax. The staff will reassure you all the way through. Afterwards you will experience some discomfort when swallowing but that soon wears off. Now, i hardly know it's there & will have some stitches removed & the line flushed on tues. When having chemo, the line made the procedure very easy. Wishing you lots of luck xx",
