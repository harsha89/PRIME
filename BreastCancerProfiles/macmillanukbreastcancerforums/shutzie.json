    "Content": "Hi All I am just about to have my 2nd chemo on Thurs my hosp has been amazing and given me some very good tips i.e. keep crush pineapple in the fridge to cleanse your pallet, keep up with the anti sickness tablets and drink lots of water! It is harrowing when you first get told you have cancer but once you get your head around it you realise how many people have survived it and this is not the end of the road just a blip! Also if you are ostrogen receptive like me I have been told to eat lots of colourful fruit and veg, oily fish, olive oil and cut out all over types of fat and no alcohol as this will cut down on the amount of oestrogen the body makes.xxx",
