      "Content": "Hi Hattie I wanted to reassure you as well that the biopsy will be fine. I have had a needle biopsy (with no local anaesthetic ) and a core biopsy with a local. For me, the needle one was more painful but not horrendous, and only felt a scratch with the core one. I have to have another one on Friday too, and like you, I'm waiting for a proper diagnosis. Good luck with your last weeks/months of uni, try not to stress too much.....easier said than done though!! Hope all goes well with your biopsy and results  Xx",

      "Content": "Hi all, I've been a bit quiet on here lately, been nervous about my op, but also have been able to have my holiday first. So after finding my lumpy area 5 months ago, and going through biopsys, scans etc, I am finally having my mastectomy and immediate diep reconstruction .  I am glad that they are finally removing the DCIS , but nervous incase it has started to become invasive after all these months. It is such a big op and will be 6-8 hours, that's really scary, but the 2 surgeons are lovely and I have faith in them that they will do a good job. I have been reading comments from some ladies that have had the same op and that has helped. I keep saying to myself that by this time tomorrow it will all be over and I will be back on the ward and starting the long recovery! Oh my goodness, I feel sick ha ha Xx",
