    "Content": "Hi I am nervously waiting for the result of my oncotype dx test to come through. I was diagnosed with breast cancer on the 1st October, 5 weeks after having my daughter. I had found a lump 5 weeks before her due date, which was put down to a blocked milk duct. I was seen on the ward after having my baby and the consultant still thought it was a blocked duct but said he would arrange an appt at the all inclusive breast clinic. 3 weeks later after me chasing it up 5 times, I was given an appt for 2 weeks later - 10 weeks after I first mentioned the lump at the antenatal clinic. If I hadn't been pregnant I would have had to have been checked out within 2 weeks as per NHS guidelines - ridiculous. Though if I hadn't had the delay I wouldn't have had the chance to breastfeed, so am grateful in a way. I had a lumpectomy at the end of October and was advised that I only needed radiotherapy and tablets, however when I went for my oncology appt was thrown a curveball of the oncotype dx test. I was adamant that I didn't want chemo but when advised that if it comes back it could be secondary and might not catch it in time, what's a girl to do...  so am now in the waiting game hoping that it comes back less than 20 (that was our agreed cut-off) and I don't need chemo. I am so frustrated, it took me 19 years to finally become a mum and this time should be all about enjoying my daughter but I have had all this to deal with and while I am fine physically, it is constantly on my mind and I hate not knowing what is going to happen next. I am so worried that I will need chemo and that I will be really ill with it and how will I look after my baby. I hate relying on other people and I have already had to get so much help. I am just trying to be hopeful that when I go next week it will be a low score and I can get the radiotherapy done in January, out the way and I can get on with enjoying my last 4 months maternity leave with my baby. Thanks for reading, just needing a wee rant tonight, helps to just get it out there without upsetting family and friends or them upsetting me with the usual \"you'll be fine\" Wishing everyone the best Jaki",
