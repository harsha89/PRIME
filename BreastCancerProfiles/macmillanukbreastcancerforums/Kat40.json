But everyone is ifferant!! i was quite lucky as I didn't have side effects other than my hair. well done on. It going for the pic line though, only reason they like them as it takes the hard work away from them putting your canula in. Plus your more prone to blood clots so stick to your guns I did. so you just havering fec then no dozeytaxul? take care B x",

I am currently on tomoxifan and have 4 more years et could this be a side effect from that? ",

I lost my hair after the first FEC  Dozeytaxul caused my eyelashes n eyebrows to fall out. i had no side effects from either chemos except for some leg ache from the dozey chemo.  My hair has grown back now but totally differant to how it was before as it's curly :( am really trying to embrace the curls but sadly loosing hahah.  I then had 17 herceptins which I am still having at the mo n due to graduate in June. Also 15 sessions of rads which out of chemo or rads I would rather have chemo again as rads really made me tired n tbh I am still suffering :( hope all is going well with you ?  Kat xx",
