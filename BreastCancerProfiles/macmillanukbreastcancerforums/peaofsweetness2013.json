I was also on a high dose of steroids and then tamoxifen which I understand can make you put on weight.",

      "Content": "Thanks for your response.    Mine is going to be a little more complicated as I have a vertical scar running down my stomach. My new breast will have to be made out of two halves; one piece of tissue from each side of my stomach.  They're not sure how much of a breast they will be able to make as I don't have much fat either.  I'll probably have to have my other reduced at a later stage.   I don't smoke so the blood vessels should be ok.  I've had a CT scan to check on that and the amount of scar tissue from previous surgeries so will get the results from that when I see the surgeons in a couple of weeks.   I'm feeling so confused and scared.   I so wish my implant had worked .",

I had a tumour removed from my leg earlier this year.  Within an hour of dropping me off at home (on crutches and barely able to walk) my very new husband disappeared up to his old house in London (as he was very busy ... don't think so!).  I was left feeling shocked, unvalued, unsupported and unloved.  I wasn't able to walk to the kitchen to make a cup of tea and had to sleep on the sofa for weeks as I couldn't get up the stairs!  I couldn't believe he just left me to fend for myself! I'm due to have a diep flap reconstruction on 30th September and I'm terrified; not only of the surgery and recovery but what it will do to our relationship.",
