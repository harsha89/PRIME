      "Content": "I had a lumpectemy followed by radio therapy three years ago also prescribed tamoxifen. I had my first mammogram since my op last year. About a month later my breast became very red and inflamed I also had a fever Gp gave me penicillin and it cleared up. Well about a month ago I had another mammogram and the same thing has happened again I am still taking penicellin at the moment and again the fever has gone down. Is it just a coincedence that it happens a few weeks after my mammogram.",
