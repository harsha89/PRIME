I was like th e honey monster of cooked breakfasts , I just couldn't get enough & every time I ate it it was the best cooked breakfast ever . It was quite like being pregnant & having cravings. It's only now, 10 months on from chemo that I'm really getting to grips with my diet. There are so many 'foods that cure cancer' . I try & listen to my body but have recently started introducing coconut water , coconut milk & coconut oil into my diet as they have so many benefits for hair, skin, bones & energy. Zinc is meant to be good for bones too & it's definitely the bones that seem to suffer mostly through all the treatment & beyond. focusing on one day at a time is definitely the best advice & be kind to yourself . lots of love xx",

Last Christmas I didn't recognise the fat , hairless creature I'd become but decided to put my face on Facebook to help my daughter raise money for Macmillan in the London Marathon. It shocked a lot of people But raised a staggering £1700 in 4 days ! She went on to raise over £5000 & has just been told by McMillan that she was in the top 1% of fund raisers last year.  A year later I have very thick very curly hair which I've had cut into a pixie cut & highlighted. After each hair appointment I look more like the old me but it's a slow process, much slower than I hoped to be honest.  BC treatment removes all vanity & lets you see your true beauty , your soul. Embrace the experience & hold the faith that you will feel & look like a sexual human being again in time . Love & hugs, Lorraine xx",
