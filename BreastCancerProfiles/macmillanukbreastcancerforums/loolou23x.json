      "Content": "hi all i have been told that i am her2positive so its a different ball game now like choices as in chemo and herceptin. as i live on my own im very worried about being able to cope with it all and taking tablets on time and cooking and stuff and i still cant make my mind up about if i should just trust the stats  and prognosis and just have radiotherepy or what im so frightened of side effects and chemo brain especially and now two months have passed since the op i have to do something soon so im in a pickle. prognosis is according to adjuvent ..risk of further recurrence aprox 20-25%, with endocrine treatment this is reduced to 10%.The   chance of being alive in 10 years with no further treatment  is 85-88%. the addition of Letrozole increases this to about 90%. Because im Her2 Positive i could have chemo and herceptin but it only adds another 2% benefit on top of the benefit from endocrine treatment. the risk of life threatening complications in the order of about 1% so actual benefit is small. ? also radiotherepy improves overall benefit by 3-4%  so overall survival with just letrozole and and radiotherepy is over 90%.   I dont know if over 90% includes living with cancer cos it may have returned. so im in a nightmare trying to make a decision. especially the chemo brain thing.  can anyone offer any advice loolou23x",
