      "Content": "Hi Everyone I'm new to the group and would really love a bit of advice! I'm due to have mastectomy on left breast 8th June with immediate reconstruction. I'm a big boobed girl and he said rather than do uplift and reduction at same time on the natural boob, he will wait until the new one has settled so he can alter accordingly. My worry is...What d I do about the difference in size, uplift etc whilst waiting for the reduction? Will it be really lopsided and noticeable? Also I have ordered some front fastening bras from Asda (they were highly recommended by the nurse) how long will I wear these for? and will I need to pad the new boob out to match my natural one?! I'm really unsure what I'm going to do! Thanks for any advice - much appreciated Suzyque63 x",
