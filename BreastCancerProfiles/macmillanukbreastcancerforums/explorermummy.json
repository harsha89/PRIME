    "Content": "Evening all. Hope no-one minds me posting but just need to say this out loud sort of! And my lovely family struggled to cope last year so I do not want to cause them more upset just because I have probably silly worries. I had a left lumpectomy, lymph glands removed, chemo and rads for triple negative bc between April and late November 2014. I was 38. I have my six month mammogram on Monday which in itself is a niggle in the back of my head but.... my breast is quite tender - the slightest bump is ridiculously painful and the nipple is very dry and itchy. Tbh I assumed the latter was a leftover from rads but now I am worrying (probably seeing monsters in the closet!)  Thanks for reading / listening - any and all advice appreciated x    ",
