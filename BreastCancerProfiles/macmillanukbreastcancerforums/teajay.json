    "Content": "Hi  I have been there done that and worn the T Shirt  I was told in July 2010 I have cancer.  I have 2 sisters ans 1 brother and they live close to me.  1 Sister comes every other day to see me the only family member that bothers with me  .  Yet my other sister and brother live 3 mins away and dont either bother to come,  Best of it my sister works 4 hours aday and told my mother she has not got time to call at my house.   I miss my mum coming to see me she is in an old peoples homes and cant get out as she is not well herself,  I make every effort to go and see her twicw a week even when I have been feeling really poorly due to my chemo and I have to walk a mile there and a mile back as I donr drive and no buses go that way,       I have neice's and newphews that live 3 mins away and guess what they dont call either   in fact they dont phone text or anything unless they want me to do something for them,   Well I have made it clear to them dont ask me any more as you will gwt a big fat NO   My sister said to me oh you will be fine,  I was told last week my cancer has come back and all she said was oh well its not that bad you can have more treatment.  I have also found out who my real friends are .   some that come are brill take me out and treat me to meals and bits and bob.  others come and all they do is moan about work and there lifes,,,   Oh and there are so many people that i thought were my friend say I will call see ya  well they must of forgot where I live as still waiting for them to call.      So as from now on I am just going to look after me and my 2 dogs they have kept me going on good and bad days   Teresa xx   Moan over",
