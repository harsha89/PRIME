      "Content": "Hello I am new to this site.  My mother told me on Sunday that she has been diagnosed with breast cancer.  I feel like I've been hit by a juggernaut and even as I'm typing this I cannot take it in.  She is 69 and has a 19mm Stage 1 cancer.  She is due to have a lumpectomy on Friday.  Going with her to the cancer unit yesterday to talk through the operation and treatment afterwards really hit home to me that I could lose her.  I haven't been able to stop crying since.  I am trying to put a brave face on in front of my children and at work but I don't know how much longer I can do that.  And there's still so far to go.  The doctor has emphasised that its the lowest stage of cancer but even so I know how sly cancer is and I am so worried.  I constantly feel sick and I'm not sleeping.  My mother has known for 3 weeks already and she seems calm.  She said \"It is what it is and we just have to get on with it\".  I just feel so lost.  Is there anyone out there going through this?",

      "Content": "Thanks so much for your kind words. Yes I do feel like I'm not ready to be the grown up. My mother has always looked after me not the other way round. I can't physically get the word cancer out of my mouth. It gets stuck in my throat. I havent told any of my close friends. Only my husband and my boss know. Work is horrendous. I can't concentrate on anything. I keep seeing my mum's face nodding along to the Macmillan nurse as she explained radiotherapy. My mum having radiotherapy! No!! I can't accept it. It's good to know I'm not the only one who feels like this. Thanks x",

      "Content": "Hi Londongal  Thanks for your kind words. My mum kept it to herself for weeks because she didn't want to upset us. Also my brother's wife had a baby last week so she didn't want to spoil her arrival. She still hasn't told my brother for this reason. I suppose that's what mothers do at the end of the day -protect their children and try to shield them from pain. I would want to do the same for my sons if it were me. I guess however old we are we are still children of our parents and we always want them to be strong so it turns your world upside down when they are not.  Thanks again for your message x",

      "Content": "Hi Carolyn Thanks ever so much for your kind words of support. I'm at my desk trying not to cry with relief at your words. I know nothing is a given and things don't go to plan but those sort of percentages have to make me think positively about my mother's treatment. I have to be strong for her and I will be a rock for her the way she has been one for me all my life. I'm so glad I found this message board.  Thank you thank you thank you xxx",

She needs me to be strong for her and you are right that helping in practical ways will help her but also help me to feel I'm doing as much as I possibly can to help her through this.  Thanks x",
