      "Content": "Hi all I am new to this site although this is my second time around with breast cancer.  last time i had a lumpectomy and radiotherapy and i have been on tamoxifan for 3 years.  But all to no avail as the tumour returned and i have just had a mastectomy. All at a time when I had just retired and was about to set off to the wide blue yonder ( well a house in France)   Now the decision is do I do chemotherapy.  There is no spread in my body i have had 2 clear scans both CT and MRI, the lymph nodes are clear.  the cancer is on the cusp between grade 2 and 3 at 2.1 cm.  The statistics would seem to show that there is very little advantage to having chemo in terms of percentage likelihood of survival or recurrence and I am reluctant to put my body through what I know will be hell for 6 months. I Know the decision is mine and mine alone but how did you all make up your minds one way or the other  in a situation like this where the evidence is not clear cut?  Any thoughts?",
