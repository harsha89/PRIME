    "Content": "Wow  Lauraloui5e. It is incredibly young to be going through this. I was diagnosed last year at the age of 33 and had chemo, Herceptin, a bilateral mastectomy and Tamoxifen. Get my new boobs in 2 weeks... I've started writing a blog of my experience during chemo with tips from everything like coping with chemo, beauty tips etc. If you'd like to have a look, it's www.chemoforbeginners.com. I'm part of a secret Facebook group for young women. If you're on Facebook and would like to join us, send me a PM - either on here or through my blog. There are some girls there in their 20s, but I have to be honest, it's mainly late 20s... It might be worth getting in touch with Coppafeel as the girl who set it up, Kris, was 23 when diagnosed so she might know some other younger girls for you to get in touch with.  Well done for getting the first treatment done. The first step is the most difficult. x",
