    "Content": "Hi Carol Have you seen any information about Daniel Field's hair colours? If your nurses say its OK to use hair colour, Daniel Field's colours don't include peroxide and give good coverage on grey hair. I used a colour recently. It has left my frazzled hair really soft and shiny. Take care if you use it the first time as the colours can be darker than expected. The site I used is www.danielfieldmailorder.co.uk. There is a leaflet on the site with some tips for covering grey hair. The mail order team are also really helpful if you have any questions. Good luck with your treatment",
