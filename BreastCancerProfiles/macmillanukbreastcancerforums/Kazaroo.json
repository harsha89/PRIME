      "Content": "Hi Jane. I realise this is some time since you posted but I'm new to the forum and was surprised to read your entry. I cannot express how identical my story is, 3 years later!  I have tried 4 different brands of letrozole and the only one that gave me any respite  from the horrible side effects was Sandoz . Unfortunately, like yourself, I was told it was not possible to request that brand as regular treatment. I pushed for Femara as my side effects became so bad on Activist, that I seriously considered not taking the tablets and leaving things to chance. My quality of life was horrendous. However, Femara has been wonderful (if you can call it that) . My quality of life is bearable and as long as I can stay on this I believe I can live my 'new' normal life.  I just don't understand that if Femara now costs £128 and the Sandoz approximately £5, why are the NHS not using the latter as a regular product offered to breast cancer patients????",
