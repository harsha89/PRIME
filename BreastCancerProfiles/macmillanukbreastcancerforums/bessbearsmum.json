    "Content": "pinkshoe Hey all, I'm pre-menopausal and was given letrozole instead of tamoxifen. I also take zoladex. I was told that, because I have a slight tendency towards thrombosis, it is better to go on letrozole. I questioned that at the time as tamoxifen seems to be the gold standard. My oncologist insisted letrozole with zoladex should do the job. She said that latest research suggested letrozole has slightly better results if combined with zoladex in pre-meno women.Â  Has anyone else has had a similar experience? i like you have been told the same but as yet not started as no letter to my gp",
