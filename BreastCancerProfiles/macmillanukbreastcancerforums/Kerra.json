    "Content": "My lovely mum is due to have a mastectomy on Wednesday next week and I know she is putting a very brave face on at the moment as my father is also very poorly with pancreatic cancer.  I know physically she will need help after the surgery but can anyone advise me on how I can help her emotionally with it? She says she doesn't care that the boob is coming off - in fact she can't wait having completed chemo.  I want to be as supportive as I can emotionally as well as practically. She's always been a great friend to me as well as a wonderful mum, and now it's my turn to be there for her.  Thanks in advance :)",
