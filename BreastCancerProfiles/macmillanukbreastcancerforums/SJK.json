    "Content": "Hello Fran Just read your post.  I am 72 years old and I was changed by my previous oncologist around 6 months ago from letrozole to tamoxifen. Letrozole made me so fatigued I could not live properly. I have secondary breast cancer locally advanced er +  I am coping OK with tamoxifen at present, just some muscle cramps. I am seeing another oncologist on Wednesday and having my 13th Herceptin if my recent echo was OK! I'll let you know how I get on and what the new oncologist says if she has a view on tamoxifen.  Best wishes and hugs to you. love Sonia x",
