    "Content": "I too have survived Fec-T last one was 4 weeks ago and also feel completely different. I used to be quite confident but with no hair and 2 1/2 stone heavier. I am also still suffering water retention but it does seem to be slowly getting better. T just keeps giving though as I now think I am going to lose my nails .  Rads are booked to start on 22nd Feb as I am going to Rome for a week with hubby. Went to see my GP today to try and get R1 and R2 for the rads but she had never heard of it so I'm of to see BC nurse next week. I just think if there is something out there to make our life easier why shouldn't we have it. We have been through enough already. Don't hold out much hope though.  We will keep walking the walk",
