      "Content": "Hi Sharon, Femara is the original brand and if it is written on your prescription the chemist cannot legally issue anything else. It costs the NHS £90 per pack.  If the prescription is written for letrozole the chemist is legally entitled to issue any generic letrozole from any licensed manufacturer eg RelonChem, Dr Reddy\u2019s etc. These cost the NHS 86 pence per pack.  Where women are being dispensed their preferred generic letrozole it is because the chemist is providing additional customer service and can source that product at 86p or less per pack.   Most women tolerate the generic versions just as well as Femara and it does not make any sense for the NHS to spend £90 per month instead of 86p when there are many other pressing needs for that money. However if you find a generic letrozole that suits you it does make sense to find a chemist who understands your needs and will agree to source that version for you. The prices being quoted to you are different from those above because you are buying it privately.  For this you will need a private prescription.  The chemist can charge more or less what they like in this context.  The NHS prices are fixed. To answer your other question, the generic prices are low because these drugs have been around for a long time, the patent has expired and they are cheap to make - think paracetamol etc. Good luck!",

Chemo won't kill you and there is never a good time to have it!  You can skip a few birthdays and a Christmas - your family will prefer you to be around for future ones.  You are not letting them down. If you take sensible precautions to avoid infection you have every chance of being fine.  You sound young enough to be able to cope. There's no point in trying to do all of this by yourself.  Ask family and friends to help you - that's what they are for and they will probably be pleased to be able to contribute. Be demanding of your clinical team - insist on clear answers and a clear plan, with time to ask and repeat questions.  Your breast care nurse should be totally trusted and if not, ask for a different one.  You have to put yourself first; you can be assertive and demanding without being a pain in the arse. Best of luck.",

Previously I was a fit & healthy 50-something who ran regularly although not competitively.  I had to stop running during treatment but have recently started again and am completely happy that I'll be back to where I was fitness-wise in a matter of a few months. I had very few side effects from treatment - the horrors you hear about here are only one side of the story; many women have a fairly easy time but don't come here to mention it.  I did ensure that I remained active throughout treatment by lots of walking, Pilates & yoga and I also had regular sessions with a specialist macmillan physio.  I wish you the best of luck.",

Dr Susan Love\u2019s Breast Book (5th edition) has a lot on this. She is a US Professor of Surgery and her \u201cbible\u201d is often mentioned here.  We tend to focus a lot on the medical treatment because that is what we are offered by our medical teams.  I have previously commented on this forum that giving up smoking does more to increase your chances of disease-free survival than pretty much anything else.

To expect any treatment for any condition to have 100% success rate over 5 years is frankly ridiculous.  News flash - you could die from all sorts of things over the next 5 years, nothing to do with cancer.  Particularly if you are older and like any other cancer, prevalence rates rise with age.  Many cancer patients will have other medical conditions as well as cancer. The reason the NHS provides evidence-based medical treatment is precisely because there is evidence behind it.  The problem with alternative treatments is that the evidence for their effectiveness is usually either weak or absent.  For those of us funding the NHS it is therefore unacceptable to include them in the standard treatment pathway. I will also repeat myself on the subject of \"research\".  Google searches and reading a few papers does not constitute clinical research or replace many years of study and training.",

Letrozole is classed as a category M drug which means that the NHS sets the price reimbursed to the dispenser (i.e. Boots or whoever). Currently it is £1.02 for 14 tablets.  So Boots must buy it for that price or less from a wholesaler in order not to lose money.  If Sandoz is charging £1.50 and Accord is charging 95p then Boots will buy in the Accord version.  Exchange rates often affect this situation, as do manufacturing cycles and stock issues and other factors.

      "Content": "Hi Amy, I\u2019ve had private treatment via insurance and as others have said, the cost depends on what diagnostics and treatment you need.  I had an initial sentinel node biopsy followed by single mastectomy and axillary node clearance with immediate temporary reconstruction with tissue expander, then 8 cycles of chemotherapy and 15 cycles of radiotherapy.  I had a number of scans and tests including an echocardiogram.  I had about 15 sessions of physiotherapy and 4 sessions of counselling with a specialist cancer therapist.  All my chemo drugs and post-chemo injections were covered by the insurance but I got a variety of drugs from my NHS GP to counter the side effects of chemo which would not have been covered by my insurance.  I\u2019ve also had 3 x 6 monthly bisphosphonate infusions at the hospital.  I have tamoxifen from my GP. The bill currently stands at around £70k.  I had no complications, no admissions for infections during chemo, no problems or unscheduled treatments.  I do have 3 consultants (breast surgeon, plastic surgeon, oncologist).  I have not yet had reconstruction surgery. Hope that helps.  Good luck xx",
