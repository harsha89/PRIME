    "Content": "Hi, my name is Jess and I am 28 years old. I have 2 young children. I went to the doctors in Feb of this year after I felt a lump in my armpit. I had it felt and the doctor just said it was a tissue lump. I worried a lot about it so went back at the start of August this year. The doctor examined me and asked me to push down on his hand whilst he felt the lump. He said I was feeling the tendon on the end of the muscle. Or something along those lines. Anyway I'm still not convinced. It feels worse when I feel it when it's wet. I'm a great worrier and have terrible anxiety. My mum's battled a brain tumour since I was 6 and is now terminal. She's been very poorly recently and I'm not sure if this is why I'm worrying about my own health. But I was just wondering what people's thoughts were. If I was to go back again could I demand the lump was investigated further? Many thanks",
