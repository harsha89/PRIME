Jeez this time last week I had a perfect life. Trying to stay positive Just wondering how people cope with chemo, I have 3 young children and need to stay active for school runs and a toddler at home.  Thanks in advance xxxxxx",

Just been talking to a lovely nurse right now she said we can leave the room and go to the loo and she said it's shocking I'm in this room with sick people and I should ring Christie's tomorrow and get some advice. So depending on what docs say I may have to discharge myself. I have literally been sat on a bed since Sunday night. How are you finding things with 2 little ones? They really keep you going don't they. So glad you can go ahead with your 2nd treatment, this thing just need kicking into touch doesnt it  Xxx",

      "Content": "Hi ladies, Yes I got out, I had to tell 3 different doctors I was going home, they wanted me to stay in so they said they'd chat to me after my bloods. Platelets cane back at 10, not good but an improvement on 2. I'm on steroids, the Trans thingy acid tablet and another tablet so feel like I'm rattling and not sleeping at all. I had to go back in yesterday for more bloods and the hematology doctor rung me personally to say platelets are now 49. Wow best bit of news all week. Got an emergency oncologist meeting on Monday, I guess to discuss treatment but I really want to stay on TCH-P as it's what I need. I've seen online papaya leaf extract brings platelets up so I'll be mentioning that. And apart from the thrombocytopenia I have had NO side effects, no sickness, no  D or aching muscles. It's amazing to be home and I reckon after this week I can take anything this treatment throws at me. Sorry for the long post, I hope all you lovely ladies are well and I'll catch up with your posts tomorrow Much love xxxx",

      "Content": "Thanks ladies The whole week just seems a bit unreal. My bloods today have shown no changes in platelets so they're keeping me in. Not seen kids since Sunday. As all other blood levels are ok apart from platelets, they're worried. Just had some steroids and I think they're testing for further stuff with more blood tests. Obviously the first thing that comes to be mind is mestastis, apparently chemo doesn't lower your platelets for at least the first 10 days so my platelets should, in effect, still be normal.  I have had no other side effects apart from bleeding. Thank god I've not got the big D as we have to use a commode.  Hope everyone is all well, woman opposite me (who got the ward shut down) keeps shouting for a bed pan and another woman keeps chatting rubbish to me.  Xxx",
