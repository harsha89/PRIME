      "Content": "Hi all, I am a bit of a lurker currently as I finished, chemo, radio, 4 lots of surgery and now letrozole. I am currently planning my DIEP in June and hoping to have 'the other one off' but have private insurance so waiting to see what they will and wont pay for. (Any experience of this welcome). My reason for posting today is that my children are running race for life at school in a few weeks and on my(11 years) daughters sponsorship form, she wrote 'I race for life for - \"my mum\" and in brackets she wrote SURVIVOR!! It really made me think as I occasionally have moments where I forget that that all happened to me (and them) just over a year ago, and is still happening to some extent. But what I really wanted to say was, in the words of Destinys Child \"I am a survivor\" and no matter what your journey and how hard it is going through it, keep strong!!! Would love to hear from all you other survivors out there! It can be done! Much love to all no matter where you are on this nasty (but life changing) journey. Keep your head high and dont forget to breathe!! x Julie",

      "Content": "Hi there, I had my treatment and subsequent mx and temporary implant done on my private insurance. I am now planning definitive reconstruction with mx to the 'other' side and DIEP with small implants. I had (I like 'had') lobular breast cancer which I believe has a higher percentage of another occurence. My insurance company has not given me a definitive answer but is saying that they do not usually pay for prophylactic (preventative) surgery. I have no BRCA gene or family history. I wonder if anyone has had this done on private health insurance? xx Julie",

      "Content": "Hi Clair, do it! It's a little unpleasant but not too bad and it's worse to start with but your body acclimatises to the cold. I don't post much but have literally today just had my last chemo (woohoo!!!!) 4x fec and 4 x docetaxol and feel strongly that everyone should give the cold cap a go. I have kept my hair mostly and it has been a real comfort. I was told, like you that it was pretty much given that I would lose my hair and I have been told that no one could tell that I was having chemo from my hair. I lost what felt like loads from my crown in the 1st fec but still not noticeable to anyone else. Then each treatment, I noticed a little extra in the bath and when I touch my hair but this settled after the first week each time. I have had thinning of my eyebrows and eyelashes with the docetaxol and have v little pubic hair or leg hair ( not that that bothers me). It is a little extra time in the hospital when your having treatment but that is only an extra hour after treatment. I know I am in a minority but there are others so it is definitely worth trying! Feel free to ask if you want to know anything else. I've still got a way to go , I still have got radiotherapy and surgery to have but really feel as though I have leaped a huge physical and mental hurdle and feel as though I can move forward with a more positive frame than I have since diagnosis in April. Good luck with your journey! It's a tough one but worth it! Xx hugs julie",

      "Content": "Hi Denise, I had 4 x fec and 4 x tax and then mx afterwards. I have 2 children although a little older- 7 and 9 at the time. I found that I needed support for about a week after each dose of chemo (even just for moral support at times when i didnt feel I could cope alone) I was very lucky to have parents and inlaws who got into a good rhythm of helping each chemo. I would have my mum arrive the day I had chemo and stay for a week to pick up after me and keep an eye on kids, take to school etc ( my partner is not the most domesticated and was at a bit of a loss). After that my inlaws would come and mop up in a lighter touch way then by the end of the second week, I would feel more myself and able to cope so kick them all home, but needed the rest of my kids being at school. A couple of my friends would cook a casserole, curry etc for me when i came out of hospital after each session. Take support, rest sleep, eat, drink. You can do it but make sure you have help so you dont feel overwhelmed by your childrens needs. Any questions, feel free to contact me. You can do it! Love Julie",

      "Content": "Hi Guys, It is nearly a year since I was first diagnosed and I have been up and down and done it all! SNB, chemo, secondary scare (turned out ok), mx, radio, oopherectomy and now letrozole (did I miss anything?). After the main treatment and radio finished (mid Feb), I felt euphoric and have been riding that wave for a few months. I have been really motivated- cycling, walking, doing drawings and baking bread. Suddenly, today, I cant stop crying and am feeling really moody and emotional. I am not sure what to think... it is the Letrozole? Is it the last of oestrogen? Is it one of those delayed shock wave things? Is it that I have had to cancel weekend away this weekend with a friend because she is unwell or because my 7 year old had a tantrum this morning and told me he hates me? Oh it could also be the thought of starting my phased return after easter? Oh and Im not sleeping well- bad dreams, unable to go to sleep after falling asleep onthe sofa. I am sure I will be ok but am not used to being so emotional (Cancer diagnosis aside). I really feel like I have my own black cloud at the moment and just needed to pour it out! Thank you for listening and if anyone has any nuggets of wisdom on this one, i would be grateful.( Im thinking maybe a cheeky cocktail later - cant seem to drink wine but spirits seem ok) x Julie Wow- Ive jts reread that and I would be worried about me",

      "Content": "Hi lizane I don't post much but I saw your post and thought I should reply. I am a secondary school teacher too. I am just waiting for a cab to go to my 3rd chemo (adjuvant to mx and rads). I stopped work straight away- I was so shell shocked , there was no way I could have held it together to go to work. I have 2 young children so even if i could have managed work, i really would have nothing left for them at the end if the day. Now I struggled with the 1st chemo ( partly because I had surgery for a port and sentinel nose biopsy the week b4). The 2nd was easier but I am not really fully functional for a week after the chemo and then don't think I could handle the whole intensity of a classroom consistently enough for the other 2 weeks. Full respect to you for going to work but be realistic. Teaching is not really a job you can dip in and out of easily. Be kind to yourself and check your sick pay arrangements. You really don't want to catch something on top of everything else. You will need to rest and make time for yourself to adjust, go to appointments etc. saying that- you must do what's right for you to get through this and beat this bugger! Feel free to message me ( not sure how to do that myself). Xx Julie",

      "Content": "Hi Kat, It will be a tough day.. no matter what the result. Take some deep breaths..... Feeling sick is a normal reaction to fear. Take some more deep breaths.... (it does help, i promise). No matter what the outcome, it will be fine. It is very treatable (in its may forms) and you can get through today and will find the strength after to deal with whatever the result may be. Try not to second guess it too much and, if you can, take someone with you to hold your hand. The ladies on here are great so do post if you need after your results if you need some answers or reassurance. ... as Jane Fonda said (oh youre probably too young to remember her...) \"don't forget to breathe\". x Julie",

I sailed through rads but did feel quite emotional on the way home today. Had a few tears in the car. Like you kipper107, im not sure about getting all these emails from the mac blog going forward but will see how I go. I guess I would have missed the chance to celebrate this occasion with you guys if I didnt. Its been a long deep and dark (at times) journey but we made it out the end and now the worlds our oyster!! Im going skiing tomorrow, starting as I mean to go on by doing something new! Got lots of other inspiration but something this journey has taught me is 'one day at a time'! It is all doable, in its own time! Much love to all of you out there at whatever stage you are at in your Breast Cancer journey. x Julie",
