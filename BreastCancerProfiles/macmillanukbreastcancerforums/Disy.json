      "Content": "I go for my first chemo session today and still haven't decided about the cold cap.  It's interesting to hear you say about the headache as that's my worst concern as I suffer from migraines and worried it will bring one on.  Think I would prefer the hair loss than the migraine and maybe even look forward to my hair growing back differently!! Hope you feel better soon Wendy Dianne",

      "Content": "I was recently diagnosed with tachycardia of unknown cause and put on beta blockers.  When I went back for a  meds review I saw a different GP who suggested it might be due to having chemo and radiotherapy.  She is going to speak to another GP who has an interest in the heart, but I was wondering if this has happened to anyone else and what treatment you might have had. I just did a google search and wish I hadn't! Thank you",
