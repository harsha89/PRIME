      "Content": "Hi Alison, is it still 6 week recovery from a lumpectomy too? As I think you might be able to see from the reply I wrote to Jo, I am in a similar situation. Â  PS I have had my hair cut short, partly because I couldn't face the thought of blow drying and straightening it after the operation and now cos I know I'm having chemo. I'm hoping it'll make the hair loss easier to cope with. Vicki xx",

      "Content": "Six weeks waiting between each treatment is immense!! That means it could be nearly Christmas or beyond before I get back to work properly. I'd better start looking into benefits and funds etc. Whereabouts in Yorkshire are you Bongo? I'm in Penistone and am being treated at Barnsley. I'll definittely look on E Bay for head scarves etc. Having to have the 2nd op has really slowed things down and I am frustrated not to be able to plan and map out dates of treatment (typical teacher) and not knowing what I'll be able to fit in during training etc. Thanks for your help Vicki xx",

      "Content": "Hi Jo, I'm in a similar situation. I have grade 3 and had my lumpectomy on 26th March. I now need a 2nd op on 15th April to remove more breast tissue and then there's the wait for more results and chemo, cos it's HER2 so needs herceptin and chemo then radio and then tamoxifen. I would love a chat with the oncologist beofre 24th April so that I could get an idea of when the chemo starts, how many sessions, when it'll finish, when the radiotherapy will start etc. IT's really frustrating not knowing and not being able to plan other stuff around treatment or whether we'll be well enough to plan around treatment. I hope you get some news too, your op sounds more complicated than mine and therefore may well need more recover time. I'll let you know if I find out any more information. Vicki x",
