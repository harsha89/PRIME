      "Content": "No need to apologise, Kelly. Fear is a perfectly normal reaction in the circumstances. We've all been conditioned to think cancer is an automatic death sentence when the truth is that most people are now completely cured. So don't beat yourself up.  We all have down days. And this forum is a good place to turn to when we do. It's full of people who have been there, done that, got the t-shirt. People who understand.  And it's true, the waiting is the worst part. Once your treatment starts you'll be doing something positive to fight this off, and many besides myself have said that that makes a huge difference. So try not to worry too much. Enjoy Christmas with your family, concentrate on your house move (exciting!), and come back ready for anything in January.  Hugs to all of you.",

She brought loads of samples, with swatches of other colours, too. I should have my wig next week. I'm in Berkshire, not London, but it's worth asking if there's something similar in your area.",

      "Content": "Thanks for the good wishes on the March thread, everyone. I was allowed  home fro hospital on Sunday afternoon, with instructions to see my GP for blood pressure meds asap. That's now taken care of, so I should be okay now. Still no explanation, but at least I'm home.  Now the tax truck has hit. Anything that can hurt, does hurt. And I have no energy at all. Apart from the GP visit, I've been in bed, dozing and aching. Chemo brain, blurry eyes, diarrhoea. And cold, so cold. I just can't get warm.  2 more T sessions to go, then  I can start thinking about surgery. ",
