    "Content": "Hi to everyone, I am new to this site so any info would be gratefully received. Had lumpectomy in June but had to have 2nd op on 3rd July as not enough margin taken, 3 sentinal nodes removed in first op, saw my specialist 2 weeks ago, 2nd op all good margin now correct and nodes all clear. Went to see oncol Monday for info on next bout of treatment offered chemo but was told only 4% chance of it making any difference so I have opted for radium and hormone tablets. They prescribed the tablets there and then and am now waiting for details of when radium treatment will start. When reading all the info on tabs and radium the side effects are more or less the same, so not sure sure whether to start tabs no or wait until after radium,. As the way I look at it is that am I going to give myself a double whammy of side effects. Anyone else had this senario",
