      "Content": "Hi after diagnosed 5 weeks ago with a grade 2 breast cancer, I've had it removed and all seems clear. My nodes have also been checked and are all clear. So i thought I would just be having radiotherpy and hormone treatment since I'm ER positive. I have not seen a cancer nurse or had very much information from my hospital. Yet after seeing the oncologist this week, she told me I should have 8 sets of chemo, followed by 15 + 8 radiotherpy and a minimum of 5 years hormones. The shock of being told i have breast cancer still has not sunk in. Now I'm being told i need FEC Chemo. But then i was also told the Chemo was my choice to have or not. I have to go back on Thursday 27/12/12 and tell them. But what do I say? I have no idea why they are saying Chemo, and what will be the long term benifits be if I do have it apart from being one of the extra 2-3 people who servive over 10 years. If anyone can help set my mind at ease, has I know Chemo is not to be taken lightly and there are lots of side effects. But why are they saying i should have it but its my choice. To me its either you need it or you don't.",

      "Content": "Thank you for the advice. I'm still unsure of my final choice on the matter, I still have questions I need answers to.......I have had other healthh issues myself and have not had much support with those either. Its been a case of take the tablets and get on with it.....Saying that I do have quite a healthy life style, I eat very little fatty foods, exercise regulary and don't drink. But this percentage stuff is baffleing me, I can't see why they harp on so much about the 5/ 10 %. I would like them to give me the benifits and does anyone do these %'s on the risk of a secondary cancer arising? I know a few women who have had breast cancer and given the all clear but then years later have had a secondary cancer somewhere else. I think if I had straight answers from the medical team i might feel better.",

      "Content": "Thank you for your advice. I don't seem to be getting much from the local medical team where I live. I saw my breast cancer nurse the day I was told I had it and she gave me print outs on the operation, then later after the operation she told me what results they had and what treatment she thought I would need. i.e Radiotherapy and Hormone. But my treatment plan was for me to have 8 cycles of Chemo over 6 months first. I only know my was a grade 2 boardering a 3. no Stage wa given to me. Just the fact that a cancer like mine had never been seen in our clinic and that they were surprised I had found it myself. This is the main reason i came onto this site to see if anyone else could give me their views and maybe some advice. My GP is asking a cancer nurse from McMillan to call me but with the holidays and the fact my oncologist wants an answer by Thursday doesn't give them much time. I understand that the Chemo is to make sure they have managed to clear it all. But yes I would like to know more about the benifits apart from the percentages. This is a scary time and my family are still in shock and don't say alot in fear of upsetting me further.",
