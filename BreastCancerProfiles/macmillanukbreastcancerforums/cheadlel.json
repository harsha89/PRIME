      "Content": "Hi Fiona, Glad you're coming out of your 'Cold' spell. Its horrible and worrying at the same time as the simplset things can really make you feel ill when you know that normally you wouln't let it get the better of you- but when your immune is off theres nothing you can do other than to ride it out and keep an eye on your temp etc. I have my 2nd Taxo next week. Its odd but on the EC - even though in my opinion i seemed to fair pretty well- i had the odd days througout the 21 day break that i just felt 'off'. Now even though the start of the Taxo was bad with the joint pain and Thrush in the mouth.- i feel great at the moment! No stuffy heads, no tiredness, sleeping better, etc.  Its weird but at the moment i welcome weird!! Ha. I have my last treatment mid may and due for lymph node clearance early june and the 3 weeks radio. My consultant said i could book to go on holiday in August as should be all done by then. He just said to be Sensible when sunbathing and make sure to use protection on treatment site and try and get a bikini top that covers a lot of my boob. (No string bikinis then- bummer!) Take care all. Lou xx",

      "Content": "Hi Josie, sorry to hear things wernt oo pleasant in the beginning...but hopefully they will get better as they go along-I found that after the first EC...i was taking lots of paracetamol to ease off the headaches - but this dropped off to taking none at all by my last EC. I didn't feel sick once- the only bad thing was the Stomach Acid- hungry all the time- (EAT LITTLE BUT OFTEN) dry biscuits and crackers help just to soak up the acid. Just started the Docetaxol and OH MY GOD!. Had treatment on the wed- by Friday i was starting to ache. By Sunday i honestly hought that someone had snuck into my bedroom on Saturday night and broke every single bone in my body. I found it difficult just walking- i wont kid you - it wasnt nice- ! As you say everyone is different- but have some stroung painkillers at the ready just in case. As for the hair I had my first EC 9th dec...it started to come out on Xmas eve. By New Years day i took the decision to shave all off as was too upsetting keep coming out in bits. Just get it all off once it starts..It better that way. Didnt look too bad actually...just needed to get it tanned! lol.  like you my downstairs carpet went first! haha Must admit. time has flown by and i have 3 left and i think my hair is just startng to make an appearance-my legs have stubble- yippee! Didnt think i would ever jump for joy at that! stay strong. Love to you and all louise xx",

      "Content": "Hi Kat,  Fortunately for me i work for BUPA and am offered a free health check every year. For some reason i decided that as soon as i turned 40 i would have a health check and as i had turned 40 the check offered a mammogram with it. How fortunate for me and how thankful to god for whatever reason made me think to have one this time. All my treatment through bupa and they have been great- from treatment to giving me time off paid until all this out of the way. I'm interested to know how many ladies have had an LD  Flap skin saving masctectomy with immediate reconstruction- which is what i have had done- and how they have found the recovery. My implant seems to have folded inside and has created a crease. The boob looks great apart from a littel sticky out bit, which is the edge of the crease, which would have been great had it been in where the nipple needs to go back- but its not......so will sort of have Three nipples...unless i want to have the implant replaced when chemo over? Mmmmm...do i really need to go through anything else one asks. And for what? No one else can see it but i know its there and it pops in and out like one of those Turkey poppers...that lets u know when its cooked. haha! lou xx",

      "Content": "Good day to all you wonderful ladies! I hope that you are all the very best that you can be- considering! Well today is a good day- for a change! Its on days like these that feel like a fraud and could have gone into work! If i didn't know any better i would say that there was bugger all wrong with me! Anyway-  Yipeeeeee!  My hair on my head has started to grow back. The nurses said that it may start to regrow on the Docetaxol and sure enough its making an appearance! I look like a newly hatched chick ! Haha. Its nice to feel something up there again rather than just skin and bones! It feels fuzzy and furry- its great! Keeping with the theme of chicks and easter - i'm considering dying my FUZZ yellow! Wot do you think. !  I only hope that my fuzz continues to grow and doesnt do another runner in a couple of weeks from the Docetaxol. (I will keep you ladies posted on that one) My nails are still fine although the new gothic look i have adapted with the black nail polish an all-  may have helped. Needs must and all that eh ladies! Roll on the GOOD DAYS! Hoping you all stay well and keep your spirits up. I know the bad times are bad- but like childbirth- the difficult bits are soon forgotten- cos its all worth it in the end! Love to you all xx  ",

      "Content": "Hi Bev, and Hi to all you brave , brave ladies. I had immediate reconstruction after my LD Flap mastectomy, and yep i too feel like just tearing the bumming thing out when i've had a treatment. Everything is so sore and tender and it just feels so Alien to me. I cant wait to get the treatment over with so i can really get to grips with my implant, as until then we wont know what it really feels like!. 1 out of 3 lymphs taken at time of surgery was affcted and i have to have 15sessions of radiotherapy around june time, they said that they were just going to throw everything at me to make sure. (Great). They were unsure if i really needed it but decided was best to give it.! I read ur earlier post and would check again about the follow up scans. My consultant told me that these would be done again when chemo stops- CT , MRI etc.- like you- i did not feel my lump/cancer- it was found accidentally- so they want to make sure that not gone anywhere else! Are you on the EC at the moment! I too found the stomach acid a pain. I seemed to eat all the time until it calmed down- i was always at the fridge! Haha......yet have only put on a couple of pounds since last treatment. (amazing) little but often...and no bigs meals...thats they key! Well i have session  6 of 8 this wed. More Taxotere. (BUMMER) GONNA GET LOST OF DRUGs to cope with the joint pain and Thrush in my gob! I noticed lots of comment about avoiding dairy and so forth. I havnt been told to avoid anything.- just to be sensible- especially with takeaways and fast food etc as i am not preparing my own food! But as far as alcohol, dairy , etc they just said if i fancy it- have it!  Try to carry on as normal  so i have. I must say i trynot to let it stop my nights out! I hope you al have a good week - esp if you have a treatment ! Take care Lou x  ",

      "Content": "Hello kat and hello ladies; Hope u dont mind me joining in, but its hard to talk to close relatives about your treatment as you seem to think its all you go on about and they dont want to hear it. I have jus past passed the half way mark - had 4 EC which i seemed to ge through ok. Just had the first of the Taxotere- !  Thought things were going well- rather too well...but was short lived. Had on Wednesday and by Friday and fel like i had been hit by a Juganaught. Joint pain really bad and then got thrush in my mouth. As some of you other ladies, co-codamol and paracetamol...rather like a chocolate fireguard- useless. Will get some Tramadol for next time me thinks. Just coming to the end of my painful week i think- thank god. Cant taste anything so no point making a big effort with dinner os spening a lot on shopping as everything tastes so bland. Living on Spag on Toast and Rice Pudding. Yum! Three more to go...and then radiotherapy. Its so encouraging to hear all your experiences, like you say, i have wanted to throw in the towel after this last one....but i wont let it get the better of me! I hope everyone  is doing well...and we can do this together. Good luck to everyone for whateva the next appt is, and i hope we dont feel too bad ! xx",

      "Content": "Hi Fiona, I know wot you mean about the Nurses. They are all wonderful, but you never get a straight answer about wot to expect. You just want to prepare yourself the very best you can for whats to come, but when they said slight joint pain. what they should have said to me was MAYBE...you might want to tp prepare yourself for being Steamrollered!. I felt about 110 years old !lol. I'd just turned 40 When i decided to have a routine Mammogram. I felt no lump or pain. Had mammogram in 07 and there was nothing. 2009 - Lump found and all surrounding tissue affected so full breast off and lymph nodes affected. Consultant said i would not have felt the lump for another 2-3 years maybe and then very different situation! Outlook positive- caught early enough to treat....god knows wot would have happened had i not gone for mammogram. I have fab 11 year old...and its a shame she has to see her mum like this...but she's great and massages my bald head. Ah bless! Youre right about one thing honey...a bloody big party at the end of all this crap. Love to you and all  Louise xx",

      "Content": "Ah Bev, I m glad i made u Chuckle- and the night before treatment aswell. My Breast nurse also explained that Chemo has an effect on the healing of the surgery, as effectively our bodies are trying to repair themselves, ie with Fast dividing cells trying to repair scars and so forth...and then along comes the chemo and batters those fast dividing cells to death!!! Its like building a wall and then keep having it knocked down - time and time again.!...But as soon as the chemo stops then we should get a better idea of our healing. Also with the boob thing- another funny thing is that when i stand up they look great and my husband says they match and look great.....but when i lie down...MY natural boob runs for cover under my arm pit..and my BIONIC boob is readyy for action.- and standing to attention. LOL. You have to laugh dont you- or youd cry! I'll have to get a bikini that sorts that out for my hols. Padded on one side! I hope your treatment goes well and you dont feel too bad. Chin up! Look after yourself and take it easy lou xx",
