      "Content": "  Hi Sue I agree the waiting is the worst bit and not knowing what your facing. I had to wait 2 months to find out if I was getting chemo or not. Luckily they have decided not to give me it but I have a wait of 9 weeks between seeing my oncologist and radiotherapy starting. I am like you and want to know whats happening and people will tell you to try and not think about it but it's on your mind all the time. I have found the BCN to be really helpfull and never make you feel your being a bother so speak to them. I think they actually know more than the Dr. Take care and Good luck Tibby xx",

      "Content": "I have had a lumpectomy and am waiting to start my radiotherapy. My consultant wants me to make up my mind about having the genetic testing done when I go bakc to see him in 5 months. 3 of my mums sisters had breast cancer 2 in their early 40's and 1 when she turned 50. I also had ovarian cancer 6 years ago. Dr said if test was positive I could get a double masectomy. I don't know what to do either. To put myself through further surgery when I might not get cancer again. 2 of my aunts never had any more bother 1 died aged 82 but of a heart attack and the other is still going strong in her late 70s. I have 2 sons and thought at least if I have the faulty gene it won't pass to them but dr advised me this wasn't so . It's such a hard decision to make and my husband isn't happy about me having further major surgery that isn't neccessary. Good luck with whatever you decide x",

      "Content": "Hi   I wore Baker boy caps when I lost my hair as well as bandanas. I didn't like wearing my wig and after the dog got her teeth into it I kind of gave up. My hair has grown in silver and at first it was curly which was really strange as I've lways had really straight hair but after a few cuts it was back to straight again although I think much thicker than it used to be.I've just left it like that as everybody says I suit it and it saves me a fortune not getting it coloured anymore. Also my over plucked eyebrows came back in thick and dark which was a bonus. Losing my eyelashes and eyebrows was much harder than losing my hair. I had enough hair to go out about 3 months after chemo finished. It was very short but I just wore big dangly earings and I felt fine Tibby xx",
