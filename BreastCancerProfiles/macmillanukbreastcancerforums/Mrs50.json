I still found it upsetting despite telling myself it was likely to happen even using cold cap. I can\u2019t beat to get it cut but it is going very quickly. I have 2 wigs which actually look really nice and everyone says you can\u2019t tell it\u2019s a wig!  No other side effects apart from the slight nausea but will let you know how the injections go.  Good luck for next week.

      "Content": "Hi LH60 I was diagnosed in August  last year. Had a Wide Local Excision in September with no clear margins then a further re-excision in October. Unfortunately no clear margins again so was recommended to start Chemotherapy as 3 lymph nodes involved. After Chemo it was going to be Mastectomy with immediate reconstruction. At my appointment to discuss surgery, my surgeon said he could do another re-excision which came as a surprise to me but I was advised that if that wasn\u2019t successful then it would be Mastectomy. I think they try and preserve the breast as much as they can if possible. I had this done  in April this year and thankfully got the news that the cancer has now been removed. It\u2019s a difficult decision to make and you have to decide what\u2019s best for you I just decided to go on the advice of my surgeon.   I had some lipofilling done as by 3rd op quite a bit of tissue had been removed but I am happy with the results.  Wishing you well with the rest of your surgery and treatment.  S",
