    "Content": "I am interested to know if anybody has ever asked questions about the use of CCTV during radiotherapy.  Having read all literature provided I expected to be observed by CCTV during actual delivery of treatment because a patient has to be left alone in the treatment room.   However I did not  expect to be observed by CCTV during the daily setting up which is  done by a minimum of two radiographers and certainly did not expect CCTV images to be beamed into an open plan control room where any authorised person is permitted to enter and can clearly see live CCTV  images despite there being no clinical reason for them to do so.   ",
