      "Content": "Hello everyone. On Friday my grandma (92) went was taken to the Dr's after her care worker found a breast lump. (My grandma has bad demntia) The Dr said he thinks the lump has been there for a while. We are all absolutely heartbroken as I know everyone with this news would be. She's at the hospital tomorrow for all the tests and to get some answers but I was just wondering what to expect. What will they do test wise? How good of an answer will we have tomorrow? Any advice or information would be so helpful to help ease my mind. Xx ",

      "Content": "Thank you for your fast reply. My mum will be going with her to help her understand where she is and help her with the tests. Her Son's will also be there but waiting where they are able to. I understand treatment is different for everyone, I am generally under the impression that little will be done due to her age, how bad her dementia is and the fact she's very frail. But it's helpful to know that after tomorrow there will be a meeting for us all to discuss and figure out what's best for her as she is unable to understand. I will make sure to tell you what's said in hope's you can maybe explain it to me. Thank you so much ",
