      "Content": "No point in complaining I asked the question and she answered it honestly. Apparently breast cancer returns at sometime between 2 and 5 years and as I have survived thus far it is likely it will return this year and then stats say there is a 95% I will be dead in another 5 years maximum. So taking out time for palliative treatment I have maybe 1-2 years of reasonable life left. I was due to retire in 3 years so now dont know what to do. Do I plan for a long retirement or a short one ? Do I give up work now and enjoy what I have left or think positive and keep working. Or do I just face the future honestly and stay in charge by sorting the whole thing out myself, I presume you understand what I mean. I have never felt this bad before,even when I was first diagnosed. I felt so positive then about everything and my chemo,op,radiotherapy went so well",

I looked at my oncologist to give me some encouragement in my thoughts but she just said \"you are in a very high risk group\" and the cancer would probably return this year and any treatment thereafter would be palliative only.I feel like my life is now on hold until the cancer returns and then I will just be waiting for the end. It has made me so sad and negative",
