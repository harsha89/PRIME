I developed a seroma in the area but it went down of its own accord within a week. I also developed an infection in the wound site but it cleared up with an antibiotic. The exercises were a bit uncomfortable to do at the beginning but that soon wore off. I wouldn\u2019t worry too much as from my experience it wasn\u2019t too bad at all.",

Nothing showed up there but DCIS was discovered in my right breast for which I had a lumpectomy and radiotherapy. Now after my first annual mammogram I have been called back for an ultrasound scan of the left breast and axilla. Am very concerned that something was missed on the original mammogram and ultrasound scan and has now had 16 months to grow and spread.

A CT scan showed no spread and an MRI showed no primary in breast. I had an an axillary node clearance at beginning of October where 5 out of the 11 nodes removed were positive. I then had chemo, 6 cycles of FEC followed by 15 lots of radiotherapy. I am now on Letrozole which is giving me a few aches and pains and disturbed sleep. I was also supposed to have Bisphosonates but I declined because my dentist told me I would need to have at least 5 teeth taken out before I could start them which put me off having them. That and the fact I read somewhere that Bisphosonates only give you a 2 to 3 % chance of stopping cancer spreading into your bones. Must admit though that at the back of my mind lurks a suspicious I may have made the wrong decision. Good to meet others who have the same rare type of breast cancer as mine. Meant also to say I had another MRI in March this year when chemo finished and a mammogram in August, both of which were fine. I now have only to get yearly mammograms.",

      "Content": "Hi Grogg. Was interested in your reply to mamma pink regarding radiotherapy. I saw the oncologist for the first time yesterday to discuss radiation after my WLE and further excision to get clear margins and am now waiting on word as to when I will have the planning CT. I told him I was a bit concerned about the time it has taken between the re-excision and seeing him (9 weeks) and the further wait for the CT scan and radiotherapy as I had read somewhere that radiotherapy should be done between 6 and 12 weeks after the lumpectomy. He agreed the timescale was going to be very neat and said he would try to get it hurried up. He also said the re-currence rate for DCIS high grade after WLE and radiotherapy was about 15% and considering 1 in 8 women get breast cancer that wasn't too bad. Glad to see pure Aloe Vera was recommended by your hospital for use during radiotherapy. When I mentioned to the BC nurse that I had brought pure Aloe Vera home from holiday to use she said I should probably use what they recommend which is usually Diprobase. But I have seen that quite a few ladies on forums have recommended it so I will be too. Princesa 8",

      "Content": "Hi again Dolina. I think when nodes are involved a CT scan is given to find out if there has been any spread from them elsewhere. It\u2019s just another part of the procedure to make sure you get the proper treatment. Like you I\u2019d never had one before as last year I had only a lumpectomy for DCIS followed by radiotherapy. You certainly don\u2019t appear dense as you have to ask questions to find out things you don\u2019t know about or are unsure of.  ",

      "Content": "Hi Dolina. You get a blood test to check your kidney function before having a CT scan or an MRI.  It\u2019s because you are given a drink containing a contrast Dye before you have the CT scan or MRI and if your kidney function is poor it could damage your kidneys. So it is perfectly normal to have the blood test to check your kidney function is ok before having your CT scan. I had it before my CT scan. I also had an MRI but didn\u2019t need another blood test as had had the one prior to the CT scan. Hope this puts your mind at rest x",

I should have said it was only 2 or 3 ladies with this rare form of cancer that both the consultant and the oncologist said they come across  in a year. Neither of them had named it but my daughter found out it was called Occult  from googling. Unfortunately neither Macmillan nor Cancer Care UK seem to have any information online about it as very few studies have been made on it because it is so rare. I spent last night trying to find out more about it but most of it was in small studies done in various parts of America so I just ended up feeling dissatisfied which wasn\u2019t good for trying to get to sleep. I haven\u2019t really been given any information about it from my consultant and oncologist rather than it\u2019s very rare. Did you get any information about it from yours?",

I'm still a bit concerned about chemotherapy as in the oncologist words 'I'm not in the first flush of youth' and the side effects will probably be a bit more  harsh for me but the MDT think I'm fit enough for it. I had DCIS ( precancerous cells) in my other breast  last year and I had a lumpectomy followed by radiotherapy. I'm cheesed off with hospitals and tests but know I'm lucky to get such good treatment. My daughter lives 6 miles away but I see her and her two wee daughters every day. ",

I had just read last night on one of the American sites about ALND being just as effective as Mastectomy but radiotherapy to the axilla and whole breast was also recommended. My oncologist said my radiotherapy plan was to the axilla, the clavicle and the chest wall but he did not mention the whole breast which I\u2019ll need to ask him about.",

I was also told it was very rare and only about 10 to 12 ladies in my area are diagnosed with it each year. You are the first person I have come across on this site with it. I had an axillary clearance on 5th October and 5 out of 11 nodes taken out were positive. I have to have chemotherapy radiotherapy and Letrozole as it was oestrogen positive. Glad I've  at last come across someone with the same type of this wretched disease as me. ",

Hope your results are favourable when you get them especially as it will be your birthday. Hope you and your husband get out to celebrate. As for indigestion maybe caused by the co- codamol I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t help you. I was given ibuprofen and paracetamol to take after my surgery but I took the fewest I could because I\u2019ve never liked taking painkillers and they didn\u2019t cause me any indigestion, which can be awful as I\u2019ve had it in the past. Hope you get some relief from it soon. Take care",

I had a wire guided WLE 18 months ago and every step of the way on the day was discussed with me by the consultant radiologist, the surgeon and the anaethitist. The surgeon come to speak to me after the operation to tell me how it had gone and I was given an appointment to see the breast consultant in 10 days to be given the results. The exact same kind of treatment has happened this year when I went in for an axillary clearance.",

Because cancer was found in my lymph nodes but not in my breast, part of my treatment plan is a 6 monthly mammogram of that breast to keep an eye on it. When I saw a different doctor other than my consultant on the day of the mammogram she suggested as well as the 6 monthly mammograms I should also have an MRI. I know that I should be grateful that I am receiving such good monitoring but it gets me down at times thinking about the never ending worry that scans and mammograms cause. Sorry for ranting again- think it\u2019s all I seem to do on here.",
