      "Content": "Hi, Who told you it was secondary cancer? it is not secondary cancer when it spreads in to your lymph glands under your arm. i had a 5cm tumor and mine went in to ALL 25 lymph glands. i had a CT scan and it hadn't spread thankfully. As far as i know it is only secondary if it's spread in to your liver,lungs, bones and brains. Mine was stage 3A . Are you stage 4? i always think to myself that my lymth glands did a pretty good job of stopping the cancer going any further.. Keep being positive..:) Karen xx",
