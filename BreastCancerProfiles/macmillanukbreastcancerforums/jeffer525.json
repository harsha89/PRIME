      "Content": "Hi Janet   Looking forward to hearing how you have got on once you get home.  I hope that it was not too traumatic.  To Celia I can understand you being nervous but I hope there is a bed for you.  It seems a long way until the 11th but the sooner it arrives the better.  I went to the Crohns specialist yesterday and declined any treatment until after the cancer is sorted.  I did not feel I could cope with two things at once.    Love to all - keep writing.   Sheila",

I am delighted to hear that you got fit so quickly.  I am training at present so that I should be up and running as soon as possible after the op.  Whether I have a reconstruction will depend on how I feel in a few months time.  I presume from what you said you did not need either Chemo or Radiotherapy.  I am expecting the worst but if I get away with only hormone treatment that I will be jumping for joy. Thanks for all the messages. love  Sheila xx",

It was good to hear that you did not need chemo I cannot wait to find out whether I will need it but the specialist said if you lose your hair it sometimes come back curly so I have decided that will be the positive. How long were you that before you felt well? sheila XXXXX",

Feeling wonderful at present for the last 10 days, since the op I have been surprised how well I have felt, better than the previous three years. If anyone out there is waiting for surgery it really is not as bad as you are anticipating.  A double mastectomy, all the nodes from the left side and three from the right and I was home within 24 hours or the op and feeling OK.

      "Content": "Hi Celia and Janet I bought a pillow, before I knew I had cancer, from Amazon for £10 which has speakers in the pillow.  This means that I can either plug the radio, CD or Ipod into the pillow and listen without waking Eric.  I sometimes listen to world service but lately it has been annoying so I tend to just lay there.   I am not thinking too hard at present about reconstruction as I feel I can only cope  with one thing at a time and when the op is over I may be able to get my head around it.  I have always had small breast but do wonder how I will react with none. I have the added stress of having just been diagnosed with Crohns so how will one affect the other I just don't know.  The Medical man said get you flue jab as soon as you can. Big hugs are required all around. Sheila  ",

It was a joy to talk to her and here how positive she was.  She says if you have chemo and radio then after about 9 months you look back and wonder what you had worried about. Take care of yourself and I will hear your results after my op.   Love to all Sheila",

      "Content": "Yes, I took my daughter and husband along with me and got all my questions answered plus all theirs.  Helen took notes that were useful so we could check on what was said when we got home.  Much more reassured as the surgeon had done 284 procedures last year and is one of the best.  She was very happy that I had checked her credentials.  Still a bilateral mastectomy and ll the nodes from the rhs.  There was good news on the LHS as it is only DCIS and has not spread to the nodes.  I now have to bite my fingernails until the 11th Oct.  I will not know until after the op whether it is Chemo and/or Radiotherapy but I will have to take the tablets for 5 years.  No sweat for that I have been taking Thyroid for many years and do not forget, what is one more tablet? We went to M & S for coffee this morning to support the Macmillan nurses.  On Monday I go to see the specialist re Crohns.   Thinking of you all Sheila",
