      "Content": "To all the lovely ladies out there who kindly responded to my original post. I saw Oncologist yesterday; actually the one who was answering queries on here a few months ago. We discussed all options. I had previously said definitely 'no ' to chemo even if was suggested. Onco didn't seem bothered, so I assume he didn't feel it necessary. I did agree to 15 sessions of radiotherapy, reluctantly. But, it is only 3 weeks and I know I can handle that. However, the main topic was what he called 'anti hormone' tablets i.e. Letrozole plus bisophosonates. I told him that under no circumstances would I agree. One tablet would have been bad enough but having to take another to counteract effects it would have on bones was unthinkable. Understandably he attempted to explain that these tabs would /could prevent cancer coming back in breast or elsewhere. I want quality of life and not necessarily quantity and refuse to be 'made ill' with the side effects, regardless of what was actually being put into my body. He is going to refer me for a bone scan, which can be done at my GP surgery. I'm not sure if that is normal - pre radiotherapy, or if he was trying to find out if my bones are strong enough not to need these bisophosonates. If that is the case, it wont make any difference as my mind is made up. No tablets whatsoever. Whether or not this decision will turn out to be the wrong one, only time will tell, but it is one I will live with.  I got a copy of pathology report. Don't understand most of it but it seems that although initially I was told bc was Grade 3, it was 2. Seeing Oncologist in 3 months after radio and to further discuss tablets. I shall re-iterate that I will not take the tablets. He was very pleased with my progress. I had no pain whatsover after surgery. Very slight cording and lumpiness under arms and armpit but all gone. My goals now are to lose some weight and to eat more healthily. Still have the occasional square of dark choc and a few chips, roast pots etc. There will be many people here who will disagree with my decision. I really admire those who have the 'throw everything at it' attitude, but not for me. I shall continue to read all the posts with interest. You have been through so much and continue to do so. All the very best to everyone.",

Tumour was 3.5 cm and Surgeon removed all lymph nodes, only one of which had been infected. My nipple was removed. That doesn't bother me. Slight cording, but making vast improvement with exercise. I have had no pain or discomfort whatsoever and no 'after effects'. Grade 3. IDC. ER 8. PR5. Consultant very pleased. Been told that next step/s wiil be radiotherapy, Letrozole and Bisophosonates. Meds for 10 years. These worry me far more than the actual operation. Any form of medication, other than the occasional paracetamol, scares me rigid. There are so many side effects, more tabs prescribed to counteract this and it goes on and on. I'lI be meeting with Oncologist in 10 days to discuss way forward. Whilst I will go with an open mind and prepared to weigh up pros and cons, I'm really leaning towards declining treatment, particular medication. I have, and want to continue to have, a good quality of life, not hampered by side effects of meds etc. I am a widow, have no family (other than my cats) but several good friends and do voluntary work, fundraising etc. Has anyone been in similar situation?  i.e. declined further treatment after op and if their decision was the right/wrong one. I understand everyone's situation is different and decisions are personal, but it would be helpful to know your thoughts in general.",

He was very evasive, but I will badger him for an answer when we meet in 3 months. Have you started the radiotherapy yet? Do you feel comfortable in giving a bit more information? i.e. background, diagnosis etc? You could always have a 'chat' privately if that's preferable. All the very best.",

However, during 3rd week of radiotherapy - last week of June -  I got a bronchial infection. Radiologists and GP said it was because my immune system was low. Prescribed 1 week course of antibiotics. Cough also seems to be in throat, not from lungs. Dry most of the time, but so much better when it 'clears'. Very much improved, but still there.  slightly. No other symptoms. I saw GP a few days ago. He couldn't detect anything, but has referred me for a chest XRay. As it is slowly improving by itself, I'm not worried. Probably just taking longer due to recent treatments. I wonder if it was actually caused by the radiotherapy treatment or, as the professionals said, just because my immune system was low and obviously taking longer to go for same reason. The treatment was on the breast area only, but I guess the rays go right through the body. I don't take any medication at all and definitely not Letrozole, so it can't be due to that. Any ideas?",

This is more likely to happen if treatment is aimed at nodes as well. Most likely reasons are immune system being low and if anyone continues to smoke whilst having the treatment. Either way, unless accompanied by other worrying symptoms, the cough should gradually subside on its own. As has been said, if cough doesn't go or gets worse, get advice from GP.",

This will be right next to the operating theatre. As I said, procedures will likely differ between hospitals. If you've had pre med, you'll probably be wheeled into theatre. I would imagine that as you're nervous, they wont ask you to walk into theatre. I asked my lovely Surgeon why I had to walk into theatre. His reply was 'because you're not ill'. Bless him. Maybe your hosoital doesn't have this procedure anyway. Best thing to do is make a note of your questions/concerns and discuss with ward staff or the Surgeon and Anaesthetist when they come to see you before your op.",

That was funny as I was having breast surgery. Walked into operating theatre, chatting to staff and anaesthetists. They just uncovered the affected side ready for the op. Remember, doctors, nurses etc have seen all shapes and sizes of bodies. Yours wont be any different and in any case, all they're concerned about is carrying out the procedure to make you well. They wont care what you (think) you look like. You'll be sedated, so wont know or care what's happening anyway. I didn't have a pre-med, but as you are nervous, you could ask the anaesthetist when he/she sees you before your op. There's really nothing to worry or be embarassed about.",

Having major surgery and worrying about nails. I did take them off as soon as I could. Someone mentioned about wearing glasses right to the last minute. I did too and they were handed back to me in recovery room the moment I came round, the male nurse confirming that I'd 'got all my marbles'. I was also a little concerned about my dental implants getting damaged during the op. Anaesthetist was lovely about it and promised to be extra careful. They were fine. I do hope that all these responses have put original poster's (apologies, can't remember her name)  worries and concerns in some sort of perspective and put her mind at rest.",

      "Content": "Kenla210 Hiya, I am due to have my lumpectomy & OSNA on Friday - I started with 26mm lump, which has shrunk to virtually nothing. At last scan 6.5 weeks ago it was 6mm and I have had one session of chemo since then and am certain it has shrunk more as I literally cannot feel/find it at all any more! It looks like (fingers crossed) lymph nodes are clear. It is day surgery and my surgeon told me that I would be able to drive after 7-10 days and exercise after 2 weeks. It strikes me that they always err on the side of caution, and as such am expecting it to not be too bad... However, my husband has been getting annoyed with me when I was arranging for friends to come visit etc, telling me I need to calm down and make sure I have enough time to recover. I should add that I'm a stubborn cowbag, who tends to view timelines as targets to beat etc. (I even race the sat nav LOL) and rarely lets something like a minor op get in the way of plans... So my question is - how have other people found the lumpectomy/sentinnal node removal? How long till you were up and about as normal? Am I kidding myself? Also, is there anything I should specifically prepare myself for? or things that will aid with recovery? I've got my \"granny bra\" (aka 34ff non wired bra which is SOOOO attractive) at the ready, not sure if there is anything else I need? 27th March this year, I had lumpectomy, including removal of nipple due to Pagets. Level 3 node clearance. Tumour was 35mm. Total of 19 taken, one of which had been infected. Op was mid/late afternoon so stayed overnight, but I felt well enough to have gone home before that. Up and about as soon as I got to the ward. Slight cording, but not painful. More 'awkward', as had drainage bag. Breast Care Nurse had given me a V shaped pillow/cushion to place under arm. Never used it. Apart from not lugging heavy upright vacuum upstairs, I did all usual household jobs, albeit more slowly due to the bag. Bag was really annoying and took longer to drain than had been suggested. Such a relief when it went. Cords popped quite quickly after regular exercises. Had 15 sessions of radiotherapy, starting 6th June.  The exhaustion and fatigue started about beginning of 3rd week and did continue for several weeks, but not really debilitating. Was advised to keep hydrated and keep slapping on the cream and Aloe Vera gel. I also made sure I walked quite a bit as had been advised. You be fine, I'm sure.",

This would apply to me. All other sites promote AIs as follow up treatment/possibly to reduce recurrance. It seems unlikely that Consultant would suggest I take Letrozole if ineffective. I will of course include this in our forthcoming discussion. Although I wont change my mind about not taking any drugs, I would like to have all the facts and am now confused.

It is recommended to eat more fish such as sardines, mackeral etc., but as I can't bear anything with bones in, I have salmon and tuna. Smaller portions of pork, chicken, lamb and a smaller plate.

Less fat. Exercise more; walk instead of hopping on the bus or driving. My pedometer has been a great incentive. And yes, smaller potions. It's actually surprising how salad and veg and some protein can make you feel full anyway. I've also swopped milk chocolate for very dark. Eat a lot less and it's supposed to better. Don't know the veracity of this. However, don't deny yourself the occasional treat. Not fast food rubbish though. Don't ever crash diet. Bad for the body and weight comes back eventually.

      "Content": "Frenchiemum. I don't know if this will help your financial circumstances, but might be worth inquiring. When my late husband was diagnosed with Vascula Dementia, I found out in a very round about way, that someone with dementia does not have to pay Council tax, provided that they continue residing in the property. This is not advertised or widely known of course. I was sceptical and doubtful, but checked and yes, it's correct, so we didn't pay until he was admitted to Care Home. Then I had to pay as a single occupant. I've no idea if same applies to cancer treatment, recovery etc., as it is, hopefully, relatively short term, but why not phone your local Council and ask if there is a similar scheme? It might be they will agree to reduction or nil payments? If you don't ask, you'll never know and Council definitely wont tell you.",

      "Content": "I feel so very sorry for everyone who is upset and emotional about their diagnosis and treatment/s. I too had Pagets disease. Lumpectomy with nipple removal and full lymph node clearance, followed by 15 radiotherapy sessions. At no time have I been frightened, worried or emotional. No, I wasn't in denial and am definitely not emotionally 'tough' or unfeeling. The only thing that really worried me was what would happen to my cats during my hospital stay or if there was a problem. A friend very kindly stayed in my house and all was fine. I volunteer in a charity shop and worked between surgery and radiotherapy. Had a few weeks off whilst therapy carried on doing its job. Now back doing usual hours. Also working hard at fundraising. There are of course very many people who continue to work during most of their treatments. I'm almost 70 and don't worry about things I can't change.",

It might also be helpful if you asked before the meeting if the doctor will be recording, but if not, would you be permitted to do so? My Oncologist made a recording of our meeting following my surgery and gave me a copy. It was really helpful as although I made notes as we went along, I still didn't remember everything. You're not at that stage yet, but worth thinking about for any future meetings. People on here are so kind and helpful. Just keep posting. Someone will respond and try to help.",

      "Content": "Hello GK1 I'm 69. Almost 70. Recently had lumpectomy which included removal of right nipple. Also removal of 19 nodes: 1 of which had been infected. 15 sessions of radiotherapy. It was suggested that I take Letrozole for 5 years. This was subsequently increased to 10. I did a lot of research about this drug and have made the decision not to take it due to the possible/likely debiliting side effects. Of course I appreciate that many women only experience relatively minor effects, or none at all.  Oncologist, GP and several people on here suggested that I try these tablets for a while and if the side effects are too bad, then stop. This would likely mean even more presciption drugs to counter the effects. Some people think I'm really silly not to take medication to try to reduce oestrogen/prevent recurrance. I take no other meds whatsover, apart from the occasional paracetamol and prefer to spend however many years I have left feeling well and fit (well, reasonably!). Trying hard to have a better diet, lose weight, as was recommended, and exercise i.e. walk more. No ovaries as they were removed in total hysterectomy over 20 years ago To take, or not take, these meds is a very personal decision. Many women are frightened about recurrance etc and put up with the side effects - just in case. I do respect that it is their life and their decision. My decision not to take may prove to be wrong. No-one can accurately predict one way or the other. It might be worth having a look at NHS Predict. Best of luck with whatever decision you make.",

      "Content": "Radiotherapy is really nothing to be scared about. Skin type or colour doesn't determine whether or not there will be an adverse reaction. If you do as has been suggested, hopefully you'll be fine. Start moisturising before therapy starts and continue for several weeks after it finishes. Not just prior to the actual therapy appt though. Also use Aloe Vera gel to cool area if it does become warm to touch. There are various recommendations regarding which moisturisers to use. Very different but all valid. Your therapists will speak to you about this at the pre therapy appointment. The general concesus is that anything containing Sodium Lauryl Sulphate should definitely not be used, nor anything that is perfumed. Make sure you are well hydrated. I too have very fair skin. Used Superdrug own brand cruelty free moisturiser and Holland and Barrett Aloe Vera gel. Had no problems whatsoever. There is a dedicated Radiotherapy group here which you might find useful. Hope all goes well.",
