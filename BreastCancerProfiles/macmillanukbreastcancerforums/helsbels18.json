I was diagnosed last January and had wle, couple nodes emoved,  chemo and rads which finished october and I feel very strange about it all.  In some ways it feels like it happened to someone else and I feel in some ways I managed on my own as hubby couldn't cope with my cancer and both he and the kids (10 yr old) think it's all over and done with and iam back to normal and iam not, the anastrozole  is horrible (and iam to scared to change in case that's worse) and I am still stiff and painful after the rads. I also think of others whose are in a worse place and feel guilty.  I have just had my first mammogram after treatment and I think this has stirred things up in my mind also. When reading through things it seems our feelings are very common it's just that it's to hard (in the main) for our nearest and dearest to understand how it affects us and to be fair I don't think people who have not been in this position ever can and to some extent we bob along with them and turn to safe places like this forum when we need to. I am also interested  in the to the thing also as since chemo I lost a bit of one tooth and the enamel off another 2! Sending a giant hug xxxxx",

I am not sure i want to invest any more time sitting in hospital feeling grotty for hair that i will need to get cut much shorter, will thin (maybe come out anyway) and possinly still need a wig.  I also get  horrendous  tension migraine and the thought of that kicking off on top makes me feel quite ill.  I possibly would feel slightly different  if I hadn't seen my mum go through chemo for  lymphoma, her wig was fantastic and we begged her to keep it rather than grow hers back  (she didn't lol). I think it's a really personal descion as I know there are many ladies  who it worked well. However  if there are some starting treatment where oncologists  are not recommending it they need to explain why so people can make an informed choice. All that said I may change my mind in the next week . I do know  that losing my eyebrows really does bother me and I am getting semi permanent ones done .",

What I would say is that treatment to the axilla seems contentious and varies by centre! I was diagnosed in January with grade 2, stage 2 idc with 1/2 nodes (macromet) affected on snb (3 week wait for results!!) Which was a bit of a shock as it wasn't seen on ultrasound and i am presuming you are the same. I finished chemotherapy  begining of August and due to start rads which after much debating with oncologist and surgeon i went for rads to the axilla rather than clearance. My surgeon was quite adamant that clearance would not improve survival and although there was a risk of lymphodeoma with radiotherapy that long term issues where much higher with clearance.  I aldo spoke to the macmillan advice line who were very helpful.

Either way he needs to find a way of dealing with it both for you and him.  I agree with  Fiona you do think you need to be able to talk to others for support and I think this is the same whether or not partners are super or need a bit of a shake as sometimes it gets a bit intense  if there is no outside support to bring you back from the dark places of the mind and sometimes to chivvy you along and get a grip when everything seems to be spiralling out of control which happens to the strongest of  us.

My surgeon was very clear that radiotherapy to the armpit rather than clearance was the appropriate way forward as Nick has said it seems to vary by centre but very much standard practice in the US. I did have chemo followed by radiotherapy and last year is a bit of a blur but i am now back at work. Whilst you would always hope for clear nodes it definately doesnt mean that it has spread elsewhere and it certainly isnt a death sentance. You have to put your faith in the clinical team to give you the best info to make an informed decision xxc",

In my view it's no worse than other chemotherapy it's just that some of the potential side effects are different as has been said many people do not have a problem. Helen",

When I saw the oncologist in my case chemo was recommended, plus he wanted to discuss mastectomy (i have micro calcs in another area in the breast)and axillary clearance which we have agreed to park the discussion for a bit.

I work in the nhs and the last year has been horrendous  due to mat not covered due to cost cutting , my team are lovely but my post has been in a precarious position due to pay banding and the need to cut cost and I have found out that there are further changes which may mean I don't have a post to go back to or at am lower band.  I am lucky  that I get full pay for 6 months and whilst I didn't have critical illness cover (dam) I do have insurance which will cover any short fall if I go into/2 pay. The role is very challenging and mentally I don't think I can cope especially  when I will have no influence over future changes despite reassurances I do (for the past year i have watched a colleague being covertly bullied out of the organisation).  My hubby fully supports me not hoping back till chemo is finished. Physically  I don't know if I can/want to spend the last week of my treatment cycle trying to manage work mentally i dont think i can and I really feel pathetic when I read about people who have a few days off and work through chemo  (really admire them though) as i didnt expect to feel like this. ",

You are not selfish at all you have just been given life changing news and everyone here can relate to the way you are feeling at the moment. It may not feel like it at present but it does get better you just have to work  through things 1 bit at a time.  As others have said no one is \"brave\" as such as we have no choice,  the \"brave\" face is generally for others whilst our insides are in turmoil, however, we learn to deal with things in our own way. Accept/ask for help with practical things, your daughter will learn to cope. I used to wake up every morning thinking everything was fine and then the reality would hit me again, I don't do that now but I am not sure  when that stopped it just did at some point. Please vent, rant or whatever on the forum it is a great support, sending a hug x",

No one thought there was going to be a problem and in total I ended up with 6  biopsies before surgery. I built myself up for the results last Friday  but unfortunately they weren't ready so appointment rescheduled for this Friday.    Now starting to wobble so badly that my GP has prescribed low dose diazepam and I feel a right pathetic person for not coping so well at present  as there are many people in much more difficult positions than me. I am generally one of the most resillient people going so annoyed with myself at the moment.  The plan has always been surgery  followed by radiotherapy/hormone therapy and I am now terrified  that the results will change this, margins won't be clear, grade 3 instead of 2, the weak ER+ will be negative,  I could go on and on! Sorry for the ramble I think part of the problem  is that no one expected  the cancer so I am not quite believing the results will be what was expected either if that makes sense?  Helen ",

I think it's more than \"not coping\" and he seems clinically  depressed, in fact i was quite scared at some of the things he has been thinking of!  He seems and says he feels better now he has admitted  it and is taking some action. Has anyone else been in this position, if do how did you get through? ",

Don't know why i am posting this here and dont want to depress anyone further but its probably because my hubby doesn't understand how it makes me feel but also the realisation that after coming through treatment that the future is much brighter than sometimes it feels xxx",
