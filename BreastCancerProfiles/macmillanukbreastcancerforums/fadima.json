I had a really emotional day yesterday, woke up this morning still feeling abit down but I am going to try and motivate myself and try and get on with things its just so hard I find myself thinking about things like what if it comes back, when will my hair be back to how it used to be and so on sorry for going on it would just be nice to wake up in the morning not thinking about cancer, its just so tiring.",
