    "Content": "Hi Jenny, I was diagnosed with breast cancer in July and August 13th had a lumpectomy where they also took sample of lymph nodes. Had results 23rd august and unfortunately, did have to go in next day for a lymph node clearance. It kind of took the wind out of my sails and i felt exactly like you do, I know your original surgery would have been bigger but honestly I think it is better should you need to have a second op (hopefully all will be well and you won't) to go in quickly and get it over with then you can just concentrate completely on healing and not worry about further surgery. I don't know if you were given a hardback folder with dvd on Breast Cancer? The dvd is for exercises to do and please take a look at it and although they will be difficult to begin with, do try and do them they do help A LOT. I will think of you and hope all is well on Tuesday.JoB",
