Gonna go for double MX in case. however, on the positive side they have found it early and treated it it has shrunk you need lumpectomy only they will find a vein somewhere don't worry I assume it was a stage 0 or 1 which has a survival rate of 100% !!!!!!! so stop panicking, start being positive and get ready to get on with life, it is too short as we all know so make the best of whatever you have.

Having a diagnosis is probably the worst thing ever and like you I was soooo scared and fearful I would die. However there are many types, grades and treatments for breast cancer. Extra tests are vital to make sure you get the right one. The next week will be hell, go with the flow and cry, scream and rant here if you need too. It is hard to let go when family are also so scared for you and their journey is as difficult as yours. So, take each day as it comes, do some fun stuff as once on the treadmill it seems to take over life going from diagnosis, appointments, investigations and treatments in a whirl of fear,anxiety and shock. BUT YOU CAN DO THIS. WE ALL CAN BECAUSE WE HAVE TO! please know you are not alone, stay positive that so much is out there to help and as soon as you are given a Macmillan or oncology nurse ( scary words in themselves) use them to access support of others near by in the same boat or coming out the other side. hang on in there, stay positive and love yourself. much love and strength Jackie",

It is early days. it is normal for you to feel tearful and low after any operation as the anaesthetic takes time to get out of the system.  Recovery wise I would not count on 4 weeks, I have been told 8 weeks and that seems much more realistic to me. so, don't despair, I am sure you will feel better. Yes do your exercises but don't push it too hard. Your body has been through MAJOR TRAUMA as well as the psychological trauma of having cancer, needing a mastectomy and a traumatic surgical situation.

I am sure your boobs will look better, remember they have pulled you about and so there will be swelling that takes time to settle.  As for the feeling of being butchered I am not surprised. it is traumatic enough without the added trauma of your theatre experience!! It is early days. it is normal for you to feel tearful and low after any operation as the anaesthetic takes time to get out of the system.  Recovery wise I would not count on 4 weeks, I have been told 8 weeks and that seems much more realistic to me. so, don't despair, I am sure you will feel better. Yes do your exercises but don't push it too hard. Your body has been through MAJOR TRAUMA as well as the psychological trauma of having cancer, needing a mastectomy and a traumatic surgical situation. Please be kind to yourself, keep talking to us and give yourself time to heal physically and mentally. much love to you J",

Like others have said food tastes different and so you tend to eat what tastes OK. I went to the yoyo diet type of eating. Chemo week hardly anything, week 2 sweets and crackers, week 3 healthy food. Along with no energy meaning no exercise (any excuse) weight went on. It did stress me big time and I have to admit I went into bullaemia mode ( not a good idea).  However I resolved to sort it out. Having said that 7 weeks in hospital after a  double mastectomy with disastrous reconstruction meant I ended up losing 2 stone (result)! So, all I would say is don't beat yourself up about weight gain, you have enough to deal with getting through this damn journey. Good luck, stay calm and be kind to yourself. You WILL come out the other side a changed and beautiful new person. Much love xxx",

I seem to cry with exhaustion rather than feeling depressed. I too have tight aching feeling from back of chest and around my back which makes walking painful, simple painkillers help, make sure she asks for some and doesn't just soldier on. as for the feeling poorly 4 days after, yep me too, I find it continues for about 7 days and I feel semi normal 3 days prior to next chemo which does indeed put the dread into the next one. so all in all what mum feels is pretty normal. Although I don't get confused as such words fail me and I use the wrong words all the time, ie. The red sassauge - a tomatoe, suitcases - shoelaces and best of all going to the water seat- toilet, so I guess there is no hope for me. please reassure mum and get her to read this site for some sense of normality, if she doesn't use a computer either do it for her or ask what she wants to know, post and print answers for her. I have found this site support is sometimes the only thing that drags me out of bed. she is lucky to have a daughter that cares so much, well done, keep strong and don't dis pair it will end sometime and some sort of normality will prevail. much love to you and mum J",

I had FEC followed by T, the side effects are very different, do take anti sickness and I used sea bands as well, every little helps! And yes feels naughty when you say FEC but I soon referred to it as FECCY FEC!! 3. I take multivitamins daily and added calcium too, do ask as they sometimes say you shouldn't take natural stuff, oh yeah my Achilles heel in all this has been urine infection so added in Cranberry tablets too. Load up on plenty of pampering before hand as most therapists won't touch you with a barge pole during chemo.  Finally, I don't know if you are cold capping hair but invest in a silk pillow case, it helps with the itchy scalp and is nice and cool on sweaty nights. good luck J",

It is possible to survive, one day and one tiny step at a time. Keep going, stay positive, remember cup half full not half empty and keep talking weather to friends and family or to friends and virtual family here. My heart and prayers will remain with all who are fighting this bloody horrible disease and those who are supporting them too.

I am pretty sure they are able to put you on SSP but if it was a formal meeting that may lead to dismissal due to ill health they should have given you written notice and a chance to bring someone with you. Also should have produced formal minutes of the meeting. If it comes to it I would think you have a case for unfair dismissal or if you feel you have to resign then constructive dismissal. Do go to CAB and get advice. Try not to worry as it will affect your wellbeing and you need all the strength you have to keep on track. Good luck and much love xx",

For those of us that have chemo and lumpectomy it is usually use to the lump being active and broken out of the duct. chemo is the only drug available to mop up cells if you have triple negative breast cancer, that is not any of the three hormones sensitive, oestrogen,herceptin  or progesterone. I can only assume the cancer DCIS was only in the breast tissue and no lymph nodes affected, they tend to test or clear them anyway, which is why you don't need extra treatment. I would say you have been very lucky to have caught it whilst still dormant and having mastectomy means the breast tissue has gone and the cancer with it. well done for getting this far and all the best with your healing. hope this helps J xx",

Needed right removed as had grade 3 cancer removed then found multi focal DCIS fast growing in remaining tissue.mI opted for removal of both even though no sign in left one.

If I had the same dilemma I would go for bilateral but get the recon later, especially if had already had chemo. I don't need radio so am now cancer free and on the mend slowly.

What a shock for you, it is not an easy thing to get your head around. have you seen an oncologist yet?  Just do the exercises, it is very sore under the arm when you have nodes removed, I have not yet had mastectomy but have both breast removal to look forward to!! am currently having chemo to wipe up any stray cells prior to further surgery. I am triple negative, however HER 2 positive means they will throw some hormones at you to reduce the risks of future return. be kind to yourself, make sure you ask for help from friends and family, with such little ones you have it very hard. all the best and much love  J",

Why waste this next year cause if you are gonna die anyway then have a bloody good time going down. Take analgesia regularly to stay comfortable, use oromorph if you need to but be aware it can make you feel even lower in mental health. I do think the memory thing is due to the treatment and the stress.  I know it is a cliche but please do see your GP and get some support through councelling, some anti depressants, cause your serotonin is probably screwed up from chemo and disturbed sleep patterns etc. or even occ health may be willing to help you. The thing breast cancer has taught me, don't wait to have a life, make a life. If you really do think it is all over then go seek help and get some answers. sending you love and positive vibes J",

This does not show up on mammograms and it was luck the have noticed it before it breaks out. however as was trip,e negative no hormones for me so having chemo. I have made the decision rather than go for further WLE I will go for mastectomy and the surgeon has agreed it sensible to remove both with reconstruction at the point of removal. This is based on our lifestyle, due to go live on our boat in the Med so apps for scans could be difficult. although my diagnosis didn't change much the treatment has, first said 6 chemo, then 5 , back to 6. Then was due op and radio but due to mastectomies no radio required. good luck with the op and your journey, do keep in touch or friend me if you want to chat privately. kind regards J",

The last 5 months has been a whirlwind of surgery and chemo and living with a friend. i can't wait to get to the life we planned but need to get through this first. be kind to yourself, don't rush it, when else are you gonna have the support of colleagues other than now and your job is hard enough without having to be fighting this damn critter!! good luck xxx",

Yes you will be concerned for mum but she will have others to care too and you need the strength to get through chemo week by week. I amsure mum has been as she is because she feels guilty that you have to go through this. You know we all hit out at those we love, and she may also be so scared re her future, possibly leaving you and not seeing you get better. However, maybe she is just a selfish lady, some are and they will have to get on with it. Whatever she is she is your mum. Be kind to her and you. Do what YOU need and fit her in on the better days. Fingers crossed for her and obviously a huge gentle hug for you Much love xxx",

When I last saw him he would not consider surgery as I had needed to inject blood thinners into tummy because of a clot in PICC line and had 2 small pea sized lumps in tummy fat. he said if operates with them there the diner tissue will die. So I have been popping arnica tablets and rubbing arnica into the areas, one has gone, one is smaller but still there, you can also still see the skin discolouration from the bruising that was there. not sure what he is going to say but really hope to gat a date for the op, know it will be at least mid Jan but need to know when to settle my mind. So, wish me luck and keep fingers crossed for a date. Love to all and hang in you will eventually complete your journey. Much love  J xxxx",

This followed a spine fracture last year as well so guess I am hard on myself.  I thank everyone so much for support and send positive vibes to all going through the quagmire of cancer ! JJ xxx",

      "Content": "Hi, Well 7 weeks later and I have finally left hospital!!! I had bilateral mastectomy and DIEP flap reconstruction. I knew things could go wrong but never expected what happened. The flaps took with a few hiccups and some extra surgery to graft an area that died after excessive swelling. This is still healing. However it was the tummy that has been the issue. I got infection in the wound, a resistant superbug ( Not MRSA) the result it ate away my flesh and I have ended with what can only be described as a crater in my abdomen. They have put a graft on but this just covers the muscle, there is no fat over it and I have a 'ledge' about 4 cm deep where the rest of my abdomen finishes. I don't want to scaremonger but PLEASE think about ALL the possible risks. I have been unlucky but would never had this done and would have just had mastectomy if O knew what was going to happen. I got home yesterday, am so weak could barely make the stairs and have a long way to go. Hope all are hanging on in there. It is not the cancer that you have to fight it is the results of the treatment that kills the bugger!!! Good lock and love to all",

I too was convinced it had spread and I was gonna die but it hasn't and I am NOt gonna let this bloody disease get me. hang on in there, get as much help,as you can and TALK, here or call the Macmillan helpline, they are amazing and such a comfort. the worse part of this is it can't be seen so your mind runs riot, what if this, that and the other. you my love are lucky, you have been caught early and like Driemthief says 90% of us beat it, You and me we are in that, positive thinking promotes the inner being to succeed. stay strong, keep posting even if you feel daft and I send you a huge hug and a bag full of positive vibes to be used little and often. take care and hang on love J  ",

I know when you take them you buzz, shake and don't sleep but surely if you are going to go through the hell of chemo you want to take the best care of yourself and body that you can. Steroids for short term use are safe and can be vital in ensuring safe take up of the chemo drugs given. i have to say after this round of Tax and the steroids before and after not taking them would be better but, hey, just gotta do whatever it takes to kill this nasty little critter!!! please think carefully before making such decisions, especially if you haven't spoken with the one first, if you don't have all the info your division can't be informed and may be dangerous. sorry nag over.
