      "Content": "Hi Claire Libby is right we each react differently to chemo but mine wasn't as bad as I was expecting. If you can warm your veins up and keep a glove on this would help find a good vein. I had the sickness drug then steroid then the chemo mine was red (Epirubicin) yours may be different they follow with saline solution to flush vein. The 1st ones are cold as they are kept in fridge and the saline feels strange as it flushes but this wears off. Don't be supprised if you tingle down below lol this is normal and wears off. I was lucky and did not feel sick ( I ate every 4 hours snacked on cereal bars seemed to help) but did have headache which got worse when I took the extra optional sickness tablets, I will ask if they have different ones next week. I had the nurse write on the tablet boxes so I would remember what and when to take. These last 3 days and my energy seemed to be ok till day 5 when I woke with wollyhead and blured vision I did not drive for 2 days and took it easy. By day 10 I would of been ok if hadn't of caught a cold. Be careful around crowds and touching handles it's easy to pick up germs. I would say the 1st week is worst then should pick up. I kept a diary of side effects so I can prepare for next week. You need to take temp every day so pick up a digital one from asda £5. My tastebuds went experiment with stronger flavours I can taste ceaser salad dressing, chilli sauce, regge chicken, curry. I find I have more of an appitie but eat things that I can taste so dont overeat (cereal bars are good to keep in your bag along with fruit sweets). You could plough your way through loads just trying to find something you can taste! Have you got your wig yet? Everyone is different but my hair was thin anyway and by day 15 started major hair loss may get it shaved tomorrow I look like cancer now so need to take next step to look good again. Use the time when you feel ok to get yourself ready for this step so your prepared. I spent extra on my wig cost £230 but i will wear it and it looks like me! Don't forget eyebrow pencil and false eye lashes! I am flying to spain after my next chemo for couple of weeks to be with my husband will let you know how that goes! Good luck for tomorrow I hope some of this helps, you are not alone, hugs Michelle x",

      "Content": "Hi Elaine I have had problems on chemo from start with heartburn took gaviscon but only limited effectiveness Ask your onc or GP to prescribe Ranitidine (I  rang the surgery and asked didn't need to see doctor) it supresses the acid i take 150mg twice a day but just after chemo i have to double up to 300mg also helps to keep something on your stomach i use cereal bars with oats and avoid spicy food which helps.   I keep a diary of symtoms and have a drawer of remidies that I have checked are ok to take :-) Hope this helps take care Michelle",
