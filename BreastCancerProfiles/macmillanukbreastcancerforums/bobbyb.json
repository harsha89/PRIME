    "Content": "I have had dry / flaking skin were my implant is and have tried several different moisture creams including e45 but none of them worked. The only thing that did work eventually was Arnica Cream (which is a herbal remedy used for bruising) i still use it a couple of times a week to massage the area. Im not sure about using it if your on Warfarin or Asprin though, you would have to see your GP first. You might find these webites usful too as they do good quality creams and oils. Try Bayhouse aromatics or vits4u websites. I hope this is of help to some of you as it took me ages to find something that works, so I know how frustrating it is. And remeber this isnt a rehersal, this is life so make the most of every day.",
