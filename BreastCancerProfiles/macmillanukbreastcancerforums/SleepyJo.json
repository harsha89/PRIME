    "Content": "Hi Sue I had a bilateral LD flap 11 years ago aged 33 and I am thrilled with the results (still) The recovery period is long, however. I can't now remember how long it was until I drove but I did have to change my car as I didn't have power steering. I still can't drive a car without power steering! I was fortunate enough that I was able to get a lift to work from a colleague until I was able to drive. Is it worth seeing if that is an option? This time round (I now have Mantle Cell Lymphoma which is unrelated to the BC!) I live alone in a fairly remote location. I was unable to drive for sometime. I relied on Tesco for food delivery and friends and family for doctors appointments and \"crip trips\" as my sister and I call them! (she would take me out for a few hours to get me out of the house) Is there a dial a ride bus in your area or a similar scheme? Your doctor's surgery, local library or parish magazine may have information about such things. As far as the surgery goes, it would be a shame to miss out in the long term for a short term problem. I hope your find this info helpful Jo",
