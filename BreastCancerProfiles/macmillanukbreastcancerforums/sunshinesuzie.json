      "Content": "Hi. First time on here. Started FEC on Monday, so day 5 now. Despite being told I would have first 3 days of feeling \u2018invincible\u2019 have felt pretty lousy, but today a very little bit better. Couldn\u2019t eat until yesterday and have had little bit of rice pud, piece of banana and 2 slices of toast over the last 2 days. Any suggestions please, as I know I should be eating something, but just don\u2019t really know what I fancy, or would fancy. Sounds stupid, I know, but guess there are lots of you who have had the same.",
