      "Content": "Hi,  I just joined.  I too was diagnosed with stage II breast cancer with 2 positive nodes in June 2017.  Opted out of chemo and radiation with the support of my OC.  Had bi-lateral mastectomy and now on Tamoxifen, so far so good.  Had cancer on just one side.  Other side was done as preventive care.   All of a sudden in the last month my period has went haywire.  I am doing ok, am thinking its all related to the Tamoxifen.  Hoping my period will be a thing of the past.   I see my OC again in January, if things dont change with my cycle that will be discussed.   I have been having some hot flashes but not many, niht sweats come and go, no weight gain, very dry mouth, so there is a discussion that needs to be had. I too at times feel alone as it seems everyone flocks to chemo & radiation without doing any research of their own.  I was diagnosed in early June had surgery in late August.  I have my reconstruction on November 27th.   I will keep an eye out for any replies and maybe my post will give you some relief. Smile-God is in COMPLETE control!",

      "Content": "Hi I too opted out of both chemo and rads.  I did allot of research and discovery prior to my bi-lateral and now am on Tamoxifen.   Yes, I too had a band wagon of folks being ride and goving their strong opinions about me taking and or not taking the traditional route of chemo and rads.  I am like, there isnt enough data there to convince me to kill all of my healthy cells to prevent reoccurance.  And the precentages of reoccurance after my Oncatype DX text just did not give me the warm fuzzies about traditional chem and rads to treat me.  So with allot of prayer and the support of my family and my OC Im on Tamoxifen.",
