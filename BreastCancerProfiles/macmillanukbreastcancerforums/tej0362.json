Main things for me have been continued hair loss after ec very tired two days after treat so rest and drink water all day. Then gets a bit better can exercise a bit but not too much before back in clinic. Going every week bit time consuming but if less side effects then worth it. Only major prob I have had is anaemia but had that on ec as well so ob a bit suscepible. Good luck its really doable and better than ec. Tej",

      "Content": "Hi Helen I agree with all amanda has said. Take the meds drink loats of water during and after chemo. Keep a diary how ypu feel as will be reassuring during each cycle how you felt. Whilst we all react differently to chemo you shd not get all the side effects that get listed. Getting a baby toothbrush and non alcholic mouthwashalso good Iidea to keep mouth infection free. I had seven mths of chemo. Gen felt great day after (mainly due to the steroids) crshed and tired day three and four then able to get out and about rest of time tol next session albeit at a much slower pace that wld have before. So not all bad news gave time to catch up with loads of peeps. I did cold cap for four sessions of EC. Hair still fell out. Did not find cap uncomfortable just cold at first then you go numb. Import to get very close fit if u do use. Hardest thing is time it ectends treatment by. Adds hour at beg and two hrs at end. Does not work for everyone but you lose nothing by giving it a try. What I would say if you do lose your hair is it starts to come bacj quickly. Mine started to grow bacj while still on chemo. Enough after two mths to go without wig or scarf as is a short crop. Good luck with your chemo you will be able to do this xxx",

Theres a realyy helpful thread on things to help during chemo. On EC it is a thick pink liquid which nurses will sit with you and infuse slowly. Tell them how you feel and they can adjust speed as nec. Also goodopp as they will be sittong with you to ask any questions or discuss any concerns you have. Im sure theyve told you your pee will be pink for a few days after. Bit of a shock to start with but soon goes. Drink loads og water to help flush through. Its natural to be worried as its another thing your body has to cope with but it is doable and you have to remember it is doing a job. If it helps I had chemo before op but by completion of chemo I had a complete response so chemo got all the nasties. All studies show tnbc reacts well to chemo. Good luck for Friday.

      "Content": "Hi. Understand worry before starting as fear of unknown and how you will feel. As Jacqueline has said nurses great and you can ask them any questions during chemo. You shd alsi talk to them re any side effects as there are drugs that can help. If you get an opportunity also talk to others having chemo at same time. Most people happy to share experiences. You will get contact details so if you are concerned at any time you can call your team if you are happy to share drugs you are getting there will also be lovely peeps on here who can share experiences and stuff that worked for them. Whilst nit everyone gets same side effects and what works to alleviate on some does not work for others everything is worth a try. A few practical points drink loads of water during and after chemo. Helos flush toxins through and keeps you hydrated if you get hot flushes. Go with wot your body tells you. If you feel tired rest but try and get a lityle daily walk in to get fresh air. If you do get sick there are good drugs to help. Keeping a note of how you feel is excellent idea as you wont remember everything and when it occurs. Good for you so you know how you will roughly feel in each cycle and to update drs. Mosr of all take adv on days you feel good and do stuff you enjoy. Not sure how long you are having chemo for. I had for seven months and still managed to see friends and have a mini break but best of all is the chemo seems ti have doned its job. I finished two months ago and already effects fading. Ob hair takes the longest to come back but it will get there. Good luck it will be worth it. Xxx",

So my question is should it be cut to help it grow faster or leave til longer.  I no longer wear scarves or wig as sort of looks ok?  Thanx In addition when hair started returning my facial hair seems to have grown longer.  Its still fine and white so not growing whiskers or anything but wondered if the longer fuzz will stay or drop out or go back to normal length. is it related to the steroids and is there anything i can do?  so many questions thanks for listeneing. Also for those lovely ladies losing their hair know it willl start to grow back. mine did whilst still having chemp with pacitaxol. xxx",

I have found that there is a little swelling by end of the day but nothing like what it would be without the sleeves.  If it is swelling too much you should get checked out. i have been given simple exercises to do with the sleeves on to try and keep the lymph moving. plus some basic massge.  Also attending a consultatnt to do manual lymph drainage to try and reseve the fluid retention before it hardens (after which it is irreversible). If you are being asked to pay for these services and unable to do so suggest you speak to the mcmillan helpline. Plus there is a mcmillan booklet all on lymphodema that contains exercise and simple massage that is very helpful.  This can be downladed or ordered as a booklet. good luck as it is no fun - one of worst things about the cancer again cos its so visible probably. tej",

Once starts you go with the flow and it becomes more reassuring and theres comfort in the routine. Its nit unusual to have chemo first. Your team will ecplain why its the best action. Write diwn lists of q for each appoint. You wont remember them otherwise. When you know which chemos you are having post the details as there will be someone here who has had simiar and can offer all sorts of help. I had chemo first. Grade three triple negative in rhs. I had six mths chemi which at the end of was told no sign of cancer on scans. So whilst its a bit scary before u start chemo can do a good job. Ask away with any questions concerns you have. We are all at various stages and here to help and support as we were helped and supported when we started the journey. Chemo is not easy but it is very doable. Xxx",

The day of the op i had no time to think about it as everyone in team came into room at some point to put at ease. went down for op about 10.30 and back in recovery around 12 (had mx and aux node clearance). I felt no pain after op (good meds :-)).  You may get a strange feeling like little electric shocks just after op but dont worry that is nerves mending and just a surpirsie rather than a pain.  The drains are awkward til you have out but you get a little bag to carry them around in so you will be mobile after a couple of days (takes about that for anethestic to get out of system). best advice is to do all the exercises set as these will help you get feeling back and movement and prevent any cording.  Fell a bit weird at first but perserve (if you get pain when doing tell BCN).  Drains were taken out days after op for me but will vary. since then be able to do all stuff did before just have to be vareful not to lift anything for a while and prob wont drive for  2 ish weeks. I stayed in one night because requested, so worth asking for this.  Its worth it to get rid of the cancer.  Good luck and let us know how you get on. if you wnted to chat in private Mcmillan do a buddy service where they match you up with someone who has been through similar. I found it really reassuring to be able to email direct as well as using this site so is another invaluable service Mcmillan can provide.xxx",

Dont hold your breath when chemo starts it will make you sick (found that the hard way!)

      "Content": "Hi Jeanette hope you are recovering well after your op. i used the cold cap but still lost my hair after 3 sessions of EC.  From what i have seen its a bit hit and miss whether it works.  It extends the time for chemo by about 3 hours (half an hour before start and two hours after. plus waiting for nurses to be available). If you do have cold cap wash hair as little as possible to try and help it not fall out (i only found that out after mine had gone) As mentioned good to sort out a wig before you lose your hair. Tony and Guy have a partnership with macmillan where you can get your hair sorted for free whilst on chemo and they will source wigs for you to try on or your nurses will prob have recommendations of local places for you to get them. Just dont be drageed into paying £300 plus for a wig at a wigshop as there are eqyally good versions available for much less!. Have fun choosing wigs scarves hats etc.  all are good at any time of year. Also may be worth visit to Boots who are also in partnership with Macmillan for a makeover as this will help you make up should eyelashes and eyebrows also go.  Then if they dont go you have still had a fun makeover before starting. Not sure how many FECs you are having.  I had pacitaxol after EC and hair started growing about two months after EC finished. Started off as a peach like look and currently quite dark and about 1 inch but baby fine.  I wash once a week with organic shampoo but rub in organic almond oil every day. Not sure when to get it cut as not at that stage just yet. Hope that helps Tejx",

If drs say not infected that is good but I would insist on regular check ups with nurses in GP or at hospital so they can redress for you.  Anything that concerns you is a distraction and you should keep on to get comfort it is being addressed. xxx",

Currently on pacitaxol weekly with avastion. Again get tired but avastion worse than tax. Do get running nose as no nose hair. Having said all that side effects can differ. For all cycles I have used a childs electronic toothbrush and change head for each chemo. Hope helps. If in any doubt during chemo phone chemo nurses who can chat through.

      "Content": "Hi. So sorry that is the news and i am sure you are both still in shock. You dont say what type the cancer is but if it is triple negative then that responds really well to chemo. I was in a similar situation in that cancer spread to lymph nodes under arm and in chest so could not have surgery they said at first. however after chemo there was no eviidence of the cancer as it was completely resolved. I then had surgery (they gave me the choice) and radiotherapy. I had my first scan after treatment finished recently still showing no evidence of disease. So what I am saying is that this can be beaten even if it has spread so of course enjoy every moment but Im sure there are other ladies like me on here that can reassure that its possible to control it. Good luck at the planning meeting next week. You will prob have loads of questions afterwards. The chemo link given will be great as well. xxx",

I onlt mention that to assure that even if spread it is treatable. Had last year off but just about to testart work.
