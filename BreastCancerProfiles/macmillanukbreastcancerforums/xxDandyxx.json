    "Content": "Hi everybody,  I am new....... I have had breast cancer 3 times followed by radiotherapy, chemo and medication.  I have been under the hospital for 17 years now.  I have returned to work soon after each time (mostly with no choice but I do want to continue to work).  Now I find that initially the fatigue was getting to me and I tried to carry on, but now I am seriously struggling.  I find I can't cope with such a stressful job and intolerable work environment, the pace and the pressure has been getting to me and I am now finding my mental wellbeing is suffering greatly.  I have mustered every thing I possibly have to continue but I just can't cope any more and this is presenting problems at work.  I am only been in my new job 8 weeks (I was severely bullied in my previous job) and my manager is raising issues.  I can't afford to be sacked and I can't afford to leave, I will lose my house and will have nowhere to go.  I could manage part-time but I need full-time pay to live.  I have had no support from family or friends and I have managed on my own but now its becoming too much. I would be grateful for any suggestions at all, please?  Thank you so very much.",
