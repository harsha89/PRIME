My hair is currently shoulder length and quite thick, I\u2019m not sure whether to have it cut in to a short style or just buzz cut it so I don\u2019t notice it coming out as much. My head feels very odd, like my hair follicles are super sensitised as if I\u2019ve had a tight pony tail in for too long, very weird. Next EC 12/12, all going well...",

I don\u2019t think I had enough in my stomach when I had my first treatment which made the nausea and vomiting much worse so I\u2019m going to line my stomach pre treatment. I went for a shower last night to ease my aching head and lost LOADS of hair but I still don\u2019t see any gaps but it\u2019s floating about everywhere I\u2019ve ordered a couple of hats as the ones the chemo unit gave me we\u2019re not pretty hope everyone else is doing ok.

I developed a hot, slightly swollen boob last night which I was slightly surprised happened so soon.  I thought it would take time to build up (guess who did no real rads research before starting lol) Apprehensive about breast clinic this afternoon but relieved to have got an appointment so soon after mentioning the lump to the BCN. Good luck to.everyobe else having rads xxx",

I'm just day 1 of cycle 2 and my lashes and eyebrows are certainly getting thin.  Like a lot of people above I too am finding this more upsetting than my hair as I can just bury my head under a woolly hat but I'm worried about it being really visible on my face.",

It\u2019s an awful feeling when they tell you it\u2019s up to you isn\u2019t it?  I\u2019m not surprised your head is spinning. I was offered the oncotype DX test but in the end after talking to my hubby, friends and BCN I decided to forego oncotype and take the chemo as my 10 year benefit from the Predict score of having chemo was nearly 9%. I\u2019m waiting to see the oncologist on Friday to find out when my chemo will start. It is a very difficult decision but I felt so much calmer and less all over the place once I\u2019d finally made it, I hope the same for you but it would be so much better if they would guide us more. Can you speak to your breast nurse to try and help you decide?",

      "Content": "So last chemo was 6th March.   I had my planning CT scan for radiotherapy last Thursday and the plan was for 3 weeks of whole breast radio followed by 4 boost doses to the tumour bed which is marked with internal clips after my therapeutic mammoplasty in October.   The oncologist phoned me this morning to say that the tumour bed area ion the CT is too large in relation to the breast tissue left post op and they can no longer do the boost sessions as the side eects would be too great.  Has anyone else had radio but no boost?  I'm just worried as I feel that I was throwing everything at this horrible disease and now part of it has been taken away leaving me at higher risk of local recurrence.  I'm going to try and formulate some questions for the breast nurse but I feel a bit down that I am missing an important part of the treatment if that makes sense.  Probably being stupid ",
