      "Content": "A little help and guidance needed. I've waited 4 weeks for an appointment...yes..2 weeks longer than NICE guidelines and my appointment on Monday 24th has been bounced until further notice. I have a 2\" vertical crease in the armpit of my left boob, the left boob feels like that of a 16 year old girl just before her period...the right boob feels like that of the 54 year post menopausal woman that I am. Where do I go from here...do I complain and shout that I'm already 2 weeks behind NICE guidelines of being seen by a consultant within 14 days.......",

      "Content": "Hi Gay Yes, cancelled until further notice.  It's frustrating the north Wales breast clinic is on a Monday, of which we lost one for Easter last week and may day coming next week, I suspect this is what's causing the problem..I sympathise with the difficulty they have but until the cancellation letter I've  been holding it together rather well..now..urgh. Once again thank you for your reply. Xx",
