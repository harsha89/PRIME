    "Content": "Hi all I'm new here - I was diagnosed with tn last August, had a  mastectomy last Sept and have just finished 6 months of chemo.  I had 4 tumours, all grade 1 or 2, and negative sentinel nodes, so I guess that why I'm not having radiotherapy. I've just been to see my oncologist - but saw one of his 'team ' instead, who just said make sure you have mammogram once a year,' and that was it. Overjoyed as I am to have finished chemo, I feel a little bit abandoned - I thought they would tell me about my future prognosis and stuff like that.......am I being naive? My mum died of secondary breast cancer, but as she was aged 62 when she got it, they told me it was probably not genetic....I have 3 daughters so I hope so. Having said that, I now want them to remove the other breast, as I don't feel I can cope with worrying about it reappearing again. I have been offered recon surgery in 6 months, but  I hope I don't have to fight to get what I want......",
