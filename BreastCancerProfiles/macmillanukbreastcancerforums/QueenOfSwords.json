    "Content": "Hi Meggie, I'm glad you posted and don't want to scare you, but unfortunately, rare cancers do strike. My mother developed angiosarcoma almost 5 years ago as a result of the radiation she received to treat her breast cancer in 2003. Her breast cancer has not returned. The angiosarcoma cancer is very different from breast cancer even though that's one of the locations where it can develop (it can arise in any part of the body.) Any unusual bruising, redness, lumps, or \"blood blisters\" (even tiny ones) that appear in the irradiated tissue several years after treatment should be immediately biopsied to rule out angiosarcoma. Although it's very rare, it is VERY aggressive and requires treatment and monitoring by only the most experienced sarcoma oncologists and sarcoma surgeons. We are in the US and her doctor, Dr. Vinod Ravi located at MD Anderson in Houston, Texas, is one of the world's experts on this cancer.I know there are experts in London as well. If it turns out that you have developed angiosarcoma, please consider reaching out to the support group on Facebook for advice. There are more than 1,700 patients, their families and friends who post there, and there are several patients from the UK who read and post on that site and can give you the best recommendations for treatment in the UK: Facebook group: \"AngioSarcoma Cancer.\" We also have a website that provides more information: www.cureasc.org. Neither my mother's breast cancer oncologist nor her general surgeon had ever seen a case of angiosarcoma, and unfortunately, the tumor does NOT usually show up on a mammogram. I'm glad that your doctor is being assertive. This is a very rapidly growing cancer that can spread quickly. Time shouldn't be wasted, and fast treatment is important. My mother had both chemo and surgery to treat her angiosarcoma. Fortunately, she has not suffered a recurrence and is doing well right now. She is getting frequent followup scans and meetings to make sure we catch it if it recurs. I wish you the best!",
