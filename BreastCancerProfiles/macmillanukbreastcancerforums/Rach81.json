      "Content": "Thank you all so much for taking the time to reply to me. It really is very kind of you.  I was scanned by the consultant radiographer who works in the breast clinic as at my hospital for things like this you don't go to the breast clinic as such but you still see same team.  He told me that it was fine, nothing to worry about, was just slightly inflamed. I asked 3 times if he thought that it was sinister looking and was told no. I don't know if I am right, but if an experienced radiographer says it's fine, surely he knows what he is doing? I'm driving myself mad. I work for the NHS, and work in children's outpatients where I help run the paediatric oncology clinic...I don't think this helps my cause.  I'm just tired & confused. Keep wondering about the lump I had biopsied 2 years ago which turned out to be fat necrosis would have something g to do with it.  The fear of the unknown is driving me nuts.  Thanks again for listening.

      "Content": "Hi, I'm new here so please bare with me.  I'm after some advice, it's a bit long winded. In August I started feeling a swelling under my right armpit, was painful & I couldn't sleep on that side. My GP got my bloods done which all came back fine, and the pain seemed to subside for a while. I went back to see him in December, and the pain had reared up again in November. He referred me for a chest X Ray (I have a pre existing condition of dilated cardiomyopathy and polycystic ovaries) which came back clear. I had been feeling run down, headaches, ear aches, sore throat etc which he said were all viral. He also referred me for a an ultrasound. I went for that ultrasound on Monday just gone. The consultant radiographer scanned me and asked me how my cycle was, to which I replied not the best due to the PCOS. He scanned me and asked where the pain was, I informed him and he looked again there. He said there was an inflamed node but I asked if there was anything sinister looking and his reply was no, I asked if it was likely to be hormonal & he said more than likely but they like to rule out anything structural first. Fast forward to Tuesday and I went for my ECG at the doctors, to be told my ultrasound had come back as abnormal and the doctor was going to call me. He called on Wednesday and told me what the scan said, which was 'there is abnormal lymph node no cystic lesions or focal solid is seen'  My GP has said that he isn't happy with the report back from the hospital and that he is referring me to the breast clinic - I have an appointment on the 27th. He said to me that it could be breast cancer, it could be lymphoma or something less serious called a reactive lymph node. I wasn't overly concerned, but I am now. I don't understand when the radiologist told me it was fine, why my GP has referred me? 2 years ago I had a lump picked up on an ultrasound where they did a biopsy and it turned out to be fat necrosis and nothing to worry about. I'm 34, have 2 children aged 10 & 8 and the worry is real.  I don't really know who to ask for advice, I feel like I'm going out of my mind with worry when it could just be absolutely nothing, but I also know if could be something. The waiting is doing my head in. Does anyone with experience have an advice on this? I don't want to go on where there are ladies here who are really suffering with such a horrid disease. I thank you I advance for any information and advice given.  Rachael ",
