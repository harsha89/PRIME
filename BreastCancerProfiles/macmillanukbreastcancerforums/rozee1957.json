    "Content": "Look for my posts under Rozee1957 on Letrozole and my experience of the horrific side effects which increased tenfold after being given a generic brand Accord and not Cipla. I stopped taking it 3 weeks ago as I could not bear the pain any more which was impacting my body so severely in every joint and muscle. I weighed up 5 years of pain v 5 years of a better quality and given I am having yearly mammgrams for next 5 years from April I feel its the best option. The oncologist said her advice was I was low risk for a return andÂ  I could try Arimidex or Exestemene but both likely to cause the same side effects so at the moment I am not willing to risk it. Even travelling in a car was a nightmare when on Letrozole as every bump or dip in road had me gasping with the pain and even if I was driving I was experiencing severe pain. Three weeks after coming off Letrozole (Accord) I still have pain but so much reduced to a manageable level. There are other hreads on my earlier posts all ladies with same problems made worse by cheaper brands being dished out. I mentioned why I was stopping the tablet because of shitty cheap brands with more side effects and there was no chance of being offered Cipla brand again and actually they couldn't care less is my experience. Good luck with getting the proper brand.",
