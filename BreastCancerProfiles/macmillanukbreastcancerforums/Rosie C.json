    "Content": "Dear Vic, In answer to your questions (from a non professional) - no, the amount of secondaries isn't a lot, the cough indicates she's smoking too much and should cut down, at least a little (which is difficult when you've just been diagnosed), weight loss is usual if you're feeling ill ( but can be combatted by eating high calorie things - check the 'Cancer Back up' site for ways to increase calorie consumption when you're not hungry). Lastly, people react differently to chemotherapy, and you can't go by your general fitness as a guideline, but I was extremely ill during chemo - the doctors were very helpful and the amount of medication was reduced significantly so the latter stages were easier, but I could hardly stand up at one point, never mind go on holiday, so check to see the insurance details on the holiday money. Lots of love, Rosie C.",
