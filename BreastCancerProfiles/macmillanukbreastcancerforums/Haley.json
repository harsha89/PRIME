    "Content": "I went back to work early after my surgery and worked through my chemo and radiation treatments. Everyone kept telling me they couldn't believe how great I looked, but I was so tired and in pain, etc. etc. Work was something I felt I had to do at the time, for many reasons. There were lots of days when I just wanted to say \"stop\" to everything. As strange as it may sound my treatments were one of the few times I can think of (since I married and had children) that I actually put things on hold and took time for myself. In doing so, I realized I need time for myself. Since I finished treatment (10/08) most people think I should be at 100% plus. I know I need to find a way to make time for me, I know I need the time and space to pull myself back together instead of this full speed ahead race I'm in, but I haven't quite figured it out yet. I do think it's important that you find peace and space for yourself. I think it's important for overall wellbeing and our families. I think we need to remind ourselves that we should be a priority in our own life. Allow ourselves to be a priority. I wish you luck in making it happen. Love and Hugs, : J",
