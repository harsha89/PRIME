      "Content": "Hi Barbara and everyone - that's reassurance that all has gone so well for you. I'm going in at end September and am petrified and still don't know if im doing the right thing. Unlike you I am have the diep. I had breast cancer 22 years ago and have had several ops with chemo and r/t. Had implants but have very bad capsular contracture so the skin, especially on left side is very thin. I look so ugly and feel like a monster and this is the only thing I can have done apart from having the implants taken out and have nothing. It would really upset me personally to be flat chested although I am so grateful to still be here. I feel like a winger and inside I'm going crazy ( thinking shall I or shan't I ) for many reasons as the time is drawing near. Has  anyone been through the same scenario or has anyone gone through a delayed bilateral diep with damaged breast skin and tissue. I would be so grateful to hear any of your stories. Thank you so much. I do private message a lovely lady who has had the diep and she has been so nice and inspirational and she is the only person that I really know that has had it done recently. Sorry to go on and on but do hope there is someone out there who can put my mind at rest. L x  ps. Don't usually write on here cos I don't really know what and how to do things so not sure if i am doing it right.",

      "Content": "Ahh thanks for letting me know that. I had a delayed bilateral diep reconstruction in September 2015 and the lead up to having it done was quite lengthy due to several visits to the consultant and other hospital visits for various tests. I also attended the Keeping Abreast Show and Tell which was brilliant and if anyone is thinking of having any reconstruction I would definitely suggest they go to one of these showings if possible. This, at the time made my mind up to have it done even though I was told it would be about a 9 hour operation and I was scared to bits, I felt quite happy to consent in having it done as I felt that I would look and feel more normal than I did. I had capsular contracture to the breasts and they were hard, tight and very uncomfortable and I looked like a monster. Whilst I was waiting for a date to go into hospital I started to feel very anxious and scared and the more I thought about it the more I wondered if I was  doing the right thing. I watched and read lots of ladies stories but I still couldn't imagine what the finished result would be like so I contacted the breast care nurses at the hospital to ask a load of questions. The nurse put me in touch with a lovely lady who had had the same operation done and i was told that she would be able to answer any questions I had. I am so grateful that i was able to speak to such a lovely person. I spoke on the phone to her for ages and found out that she lived near to me and she kindly offered to come to my house and show me her results. When I saw her new breast I couldn't believe it. Absolutely wonderful, and seeing what could be achieved completely made my mind up in having the operation done. I am now very happy and have to say that I absolutely love my new boobs. The operation was lengthy and I would probably say that 'yes' it is a slow healing process but you do get stronger and stronger week by week.  For me it was the right thing to do and I don't have any regrets whatsoever.  I did get a couple of different infections but with the proper antibiotics everything cleared up nicely. I am now all healed and waiting to have the tattooing done as i have decided not to have a nipple reconstruction,  just a 3d areola plus I went to my local Show and Tell evening a few weeks ago, but this time I went as a volunteer model, showing others my diep reconstruction and telling my cancer journey and hopefully helping the ladies to make the right choice for them. I am now over the moon with my results and looking forward to receiving the icing on the cake so to speak (tattooing). I hope this helps anyone who is at the stage of making such a major decision and im so sorry if ive gone on and on but i just wanted you all to know how extremely satisfied I am with my diep reconstruction.",

      "Content": "Hi Angela - i too was concerned about my tummy, not so much the scarring because I knew that the knickers would cover it and I also contemplated having a tattoo along the scar if it bothered me that much  but to be honest the scar is very neat and doesn't bother me in the slightest. The thing I was worried about was having enough tummy to make 2 breasts.  I thought that because i didnt have hardly any tummy they would never be able to make a decent size bust and thought they would not have a  lot to play with, but how wrong i was. I am a size 10/12 and I have recently brought bras in a size 36c so I am well pleased. It's very deceiving but if the consultant says u have enough tummy to have a diep done then trust me,  you will have x",
