It would probably be worth calling a MacMillan nurse and/or asking for more information from your mum's clinical team. I only know women who have had just chemo, or chemo and radiotherapy, so not a great help. If the cancer is HER2 positive (HER2 is a hormone cancer uses to grow) Herceptin is also offered, and if it's oestrogen positive, hormone suppressants are also offered later in the treatment. Good luck to you both.",

I know two women who also are taking the non surgery / chemo route, diet is the main area they focus on, growing wheatgrass and other 'sprouts' at home for juicing. I'm doing a mix of diet, surgery and chemo as lots of us do, and also working on keeping endorphins high and adrenalin and cortisol low - gut feel tells me stress and anger played a big role in my cancer. A useful book for me is The Endorphin Effect by William Bloom. It would be fantastic to find an option that makes chemo redundant.

If the full list would be useful let me know and I'll try to spell them right! I don't know if it's helped but I have dropped all dairy, most meat, and sugar from my diet. A massage would be lovely, or reflexology, but I'm not sure if a therapist would treat us at this stage. You can always do reflexology yourself of course - there is science to it but a good massage all over the feet always feels good, and squeeze each toe at the tip:) It would be lovely if the next treatment were easier but will have to wait and see.

It might be worth asking your medical team if they can help too, although most of us don't want to add to our medicine intake... Also talk to Julie, she might be getting enough sleep, or you could explain that you cope better if she does sleep. She might have some better ideas than these :) Sending you love and hugs. Anne x",

      "Content": "Hi Gill, I was also diagnosed in September, I had a mastectomy and rebuild also on 6th October and started the chemo today. I have 3 x 15 year olds and a nearly 18 year old, so far they're concerned, caring and well balanced but I have been very well of course so I'm a bit worried out looking unwell to them. They have A Levels/GCSEs this year so quite tough on them but school are keeping an eye out for them. My son has type 1 so I'm aware of the injections you have to deal with too. Your family sound wonderful, as do you! It's tough to keep positive all the time but you're clearly giving it a go! One idea I was given was to focus on how I feel (happy etc.) and then think about what's going on around me and in my life, rather than let what's going on around me etc. decide how I feel - subtle but can help, I manage it about 10% of the time so far. For chemo etc. I have a portacath which is inserted into the upper left or right chest under the skin when you're sedated.All fluids are given via this and all bloods taken from there too. It does involve a single insertion of a needle into the portacath at each visit which is like an injection but might mean the minimum number of needles to deal with for you. The Hba1c blood could also be taken from the portacath if you wish. The PICC line is probably similar but I know less about it. I get brain freeze from ice lollies so declined the cold cap - wimp hey:) I hope that ramble is a bit useful. Love Anne xx",

      "Content": "Thanks very much for the ideas - lots of water and advance tablets for constipation especially, I had horrible constipation after the mastectomy/reconstruction and really don't want to go there again. I'm having a portcath fitted tomorrow so I'll ask about if I can have advance tablets. I'm procrastinating on the chemo, thinking of all sorts of reasons not to start it now, one oncologist said it would be ok to wait until 10 weeks after the op but I really should bite the bullet. Thanks again for the support, love this forum. Anne xx",
