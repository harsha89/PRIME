      "Content": "Hey Chrissie, Wow home the same day, amazing! I am post op 18 months mastectomy, I had a 5 day stay as I had a drain and had to be under a certain amount of fluid being lost before they let me go home.  Everyone experience are different some good some bad. The hospital where I had it done ( I work there too) make family members say good bye at the hospital entrance rather than come in, I was so glad of that as I think I would of been more upset if they where sat with me. Instead I went in was prepared-by a lovely nurse, in fact we had a good old laugh so I wasn't too bad with nerves.  Just remember, tomorrow is the first day of  your recovery Good luck my friend,  Lots of love n jelly tots Jacqueline",
