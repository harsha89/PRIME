      "Content": "Hi Darryl. I'm in a similar position to you as I'm taking lifelong Warfarin as I have Atrial Fibrillation, an irregular heartbeat, which was detected during my cancer treatment. I take Anastrazole which causes similar side effects. My main problem was the bone pain and joint ache, which was stopping me from sleeping. My GP and I have found medication, by trial and error, that works for me. It's taken a while to get it right but now I just get occasional aches. I take slow release Tramadol and 30mg of Amytriiptyline each night. I generally sleep well now! These drugs may not work for you but with a sympathetic GP and a bit of experimentation hopefully you can find a solution. Hope you find some relief. Take care",

      "Content": "Hi girls I don't want to put a damper on your sunbathing but just want to remind you to use an effective level of sun protection. A couple of years ago, following the end of all my treatment, I had a small mole on my arm that was worrying me a little as it had darkened. I had mentioned it during chemo and was told that if I was worried then I should show my GP. Of course as I had a bit on my plate at that time I left it. During some further treatment a year later on my scar, the surgeon noticed it and told me to see my doctor. It turned out to be a malignant melanoma. I was lucky that it was in situ and has been successfully removed along with clear margins. Some one this site (sorry forgotten who you are!) alerted me to a study by a team in Dublin that appears to have found a link between breast cancer and malignant melanoma and suggests that women, and not forgetting the men too, who have had BC should check for skin changes. It is rare so please don't all panic! Just use a high level sunscreen, preferably 30 or above. I use factor 50 now. You will still tan just not burn.",

      "Content": "Hi Powlar. You do come across as a positive person but there are times in life when we all get worn down. All of the \"blessings\" like family, friends, colleagues etc also bring responsibilities. I too was a teacher, now retired, and know only too well the daily effort that is needed to be good at it. Even when I was younger and long before the cancer I would come home exhausted and flop for half an hour before starting dinner, dealing with the teenage angst of my own three, listening to my husband's work concerns and so on! Add cancer to the mix and you can see the strains you are coping with. There is a thread on this site where people are discussing the need to carry on with hormone treatment as the side effects are so difficult. I've decided to battle on but just take one month at a time. I did ask for my oncologist for my survival stats ( I was a Maths teacher!) much to my husband's dismay. This is the 10 year survival figure and is of course out of date when you receive it. In my case the hormone therapy increased my survival chances by 10% so it's a given as far as I am concerned that I will carry on as long as I can. My next aim is to keep going for 3 years which will be April next year. I know that as the years go by your survival chances increase. It's just the element of chance that is so hard to live with. Lots of women do give up and take that chance. I feel it's all about quality of life and if the side effects become unbearable then I will probably consider stopping. One friend who was feeling nauseous now takes her tablets before going to bed instead of in the morning and that simple step resolved the sickness. I have one really good friend who had BC ten years before me and I can talk to her and express my fears in a way that is not possible with anyone else. You are right in that this is really a lottery. I just keep hoping that I'm one of the lucky ones and hope that you are too. Hugs",

      "Content": "Hi Anna . Thank you for the link. Have just read it with great interest. My mole was spotted by a surgeon who was about to perform some extra surgery on my scar. He told me to go to my GP and tell them to remove it. I don't think that he was aware of the possible link. When I told him later, after removal of the mole, that it had been malignant, he said \"I'm just a busybody who can't keep his nose out. You've made my day\". I told him he'd made my life! I wouldn't have gone for investigation without his input. Fortunately it was still in situ but my days of exposure to the sun are well and truly over. I suspect that not many medics are aware of this possible link but it could certainly be a life saver. Powlar I hope you are feeling better today? Do you have days that seem better or are you feeling totally overwhelmed? Take care.",

      "Content": "Hi Powlar. I don't think that your feelings are unusual. You have faced your own mortality when first told that you had breast cancer. Going through the treatment gives focus to it all and it's only later when everything has calmed down that you begin to face your fears. The ovarian cancer scare certainly won't have helped. However when you say that you feel paranoid I think that you need some professional help with these feelings. You say you know it isn't rational, but you will feel what you feel regardless. Ask your doctor if there is any counselling available. Trouble is there could be a long wait. Meanwhile you may find that meditation or reiki might help. Reiki certainly helped me. I'm now 3 years since diagnosis and last year a small mole turned out to be a malignant melanoma. A totally different cancer unrelated to breast cancer. But somehow I still feel very positive about my long term health. I personally get cross with the idea that you have to \"battle\" cancer. I have lost some good, strong friends to this disease. I do think being positive helps your feeling of wellbeing and my oncologist calls me one of his 100%ers. But I have always been a half full sort of person so maybe it's easier? You seem to be suffering from a kind of post traumatic stress which is perfectly understandable. But with support I'm sure you will move forward and regain your equilibrium . Hugs",

I initially had a lot of pain in my feet but it subsided very slowly. My fingers are just numb so that's not as bad! I had acupuncture at the local hospital courtesy of the physios there and it really helped with the pain in my feet. Would certainly recommend it if you can get it. I had around 6 treatments and was far more comfortable afterwards.",

      "Content": "Hi. I'm also new to the forums so we have that in common! I've now been on Anastrazole, which is an aromatise inhibitor and works in the same way as Aromasin. I've been taking it for two and a half years now. I do still suffer from some side effects, mainly bone pain and joint ache. Theses are worse at night and mainly ok during the day. I'm trying to learn to live with them as Anastrazole has higher survival rates compared to Tamoxifen in post menopausal women. Not huge percentages but there nevertheless. My team have agreed that I can change to Tamoxifen if I want to. I cope by taking painkillers when necessary and also my GP has prescribed Tramadol. I take only one 50mg tablet each night, although you can take two. This takes the edge off the pain and I can get back to sleep most nights. I also sleep on a 5cm memory foam topper as my joints ache wherever they touch the bed. I do have days when I think I don't want to continue with the drug, but am encouraged by research which shows that patients who have side effects also have better outcomes! I think it depends on how well you can cope. The effects may well lessen for you. Some people have very few side effects. The drop out rate foe these drugs is high but I think of the eventual outcome and soldier on! Gin and tonic is good too! Goodness it's past six, better go and pour one! Good luck Maggie",

      "Content": "Hi Genorm You really are having a tough time with Anastrazole. I'm lucky in that I'm now retired so if I have an bad day I can take it easy. I am very active, playing tennis twice a week and rowing on the River Dee twice a week. My husband worries that the exercise may be worsening the aches but I've found the opposite to be true. If I don't use my muscles they seem to ache more. I was given some physio when the back ache was at its worst and still do the exercises when I remember. The physio told me to use a heat pack for relief and also before exercising. I had a bone scan, an MRI scan and lots of blood tests when I originally complained of pains. Thankfully they were all clear so I was sent to physio. I don't think that the medical staff quite understand how debilitating constant aching can be. My surgeon actually said that 'we have to expect some aches and pains as we age' (closest I've come to walloping anyone lately) It's a tough choice and I suspect that some people have much worse reactions than others. I suppose that painkillers are the only solution. I find that co-codamol is fairly good as pain relief. (I personally can't take ibuprofen as I take Warfarin) there was a time when I wouldn't take medications if I could avoid them but now I take them if I feel I need them. It's one day at a time and keep looking forward. I am truly grateful that I am still here to moan! Wish I had something more useful to say.....oh yes, have you tried reiki? I am a massive sceptic who was bowled over by the calm that it induced during chemo. It really helped especially as our last granddaughter was born with severe cerebral palsy just as I had my 4th chemo and the whole family was in shock. I received reiki at the Macmillan Centre of the hospital where I was being treated as it was offered along with other complimentary therapies. It really helped with stress. Must finish. \"Im outdoors\" is digging the garden over and needs advice. At least I got out of digging too! Small blessings",

      "Content": "Hi again Mythos It is lonely on the end of a computer but this is proof that there is life out there! Prosecco sounds like a reasonable substitute to me. Enjoy. I was feeling exhausted until I started taking Tramadol. Some people don't like it as it is an opiate and can be addictive. My GP said that he felt the benefits outweighed that and that as I take such a low dose we will be able to deal with withdrawal when I no longer need it. I now go to bed knowing that most nights I will get a reasonable amount of sleep. I find this reassuring in itself as you can get easily overwrought in the middle of the nights. A friend who had breast cancer over 12 years ago talked of \"long nights of the soul\". In the early days of treatment this was most definitely the case but now I feel more grounded and able to cope. I originally thought I'd try to stay on Anastrazole for at least 2 years but when that passed I thought I'd go for 3 as my next goal. I know that a fairly large percentage of women give up. I've come this far with all the other lovely treatments and will not let this drug get the better of me if I can help it Hope you sleep well. As you can see, I tend to keep late hours. Not sleepy yet. We have a new word in our house. It's \"tramboozled \" that's how I feel in the mornings if I take it too late. Hope you sleep tonight.",

The bone scan just showed some\"age related\" degenerative disc disease! The only way to find out if its all caused by the anastrazole is to stop taking it. I don't really want to take the risk so my GP has been trying various forms of pain relief for me. I have been taking Tramadol, just one tablet before bed and that has helped to a certain degree.( I can't take ibuprofen as I take Warfarin for an irregular heartbeat) I was also taking 1000mg of paracetamol each night, but my doctor is now trying me on Amitriptyline, which is an anti-depressant when taken in large doses but at lower doses helps with joint pain. This solution may not be for you but I just wanted you to know that there are options out there. The right medication can really help you cope. I find that I ache really badly at night but can cope during the days. Some nights I think I'm at my wits end but next day it seems much better! Hope you feel better about it soon Hugs",
