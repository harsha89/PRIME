    "Content": "Hello Marg I've just joined because like you, I just felt like I was going through treatment overload.  I am so happy to know that I'm not the only one.  I stopped chemo after 3 treatments with the support from my Oncologist and am about to start radiotherapy this week.  Then they are talking about Tamoxifen.  It just feels like it will never end.  I have work to keep me sane and have a wonderful supportive husband and family.  Nice to have a forum like this that keeps you in touch with people going through the same thing.
