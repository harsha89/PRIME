Struggling with the EC chemo to be honest and not sure I'll get through all 4 :-( I'll be having 4x dose dense paclitaxel every 2 weeks after the EC which takes me to November :-( xx",

      "Content": "Thankyou for all your replies, interesting to see which other regimes people are on. Funnily enough I think I'm doing better this time round than after my first EC but the steroids finish tomorrow so no doubt I'll crash by the weekend. I think my oncologist just wanted to do the whole 'belt and braces chuck everything at it' type of thing as its grade 3, tn, I'm 38 etc even though my tumour was only 8mm and no nodes, I really questioned whether chemo was the right thing to do but too late to go back now! Thankyou for all your replies again, this sites been great :-) Sue xx ps not sure if I've posted this in the right place! ",
