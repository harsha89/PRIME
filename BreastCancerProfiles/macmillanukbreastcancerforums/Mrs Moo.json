    "Content": "I'll say welcome too even though I'd rather not! :) My husband had 8 courses of chemo last year (ending on Boxing Day). He is a teacher and was determined to work but after his 3rd cycle (which was about 2 weeks after the beginning of term) he caught a cold and ended up in hospital for 5 days on intravenous antibiotics. I don't want to put you off spending time in school with your daughter but just be careful of the snotty noses! Perhaps you could invest in a face mask to wear? I am not sure about the effects your chemo will have as his course was different (CHOP-R). He did get progressively more tired and his hair did fall out - but started to grow back in patches after the 6th cycle. s you say it is different for everyone. Feeling positive and trying to remain positive is the best thing you can do, but I totally understand your frustrations. Just do what you can do, when you can do it. Good luck and enjoy the play if you decide to go, Sally",
