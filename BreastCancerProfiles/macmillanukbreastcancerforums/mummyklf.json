      "Content": "thank you all very much for helping me. i went to my local shop today she didnt have great selection but told me bout the same websites that that you ladies have said. i like to beable to try them on as they all fit diffrent but ill just have to order on line until the shops catch up. and didnt know bout asda so thanks for that. it is very bad bout the amount of money these bras cost as you say it is only a pocket spose they think they are doing us a big favour by taking the vat off but i spose its better than nothing. thanks everyone mummyklf",
