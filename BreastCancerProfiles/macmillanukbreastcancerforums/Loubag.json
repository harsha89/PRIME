      "Content": "Interesting but doesn\u2019t hold a lot of weight in my mind. 10 year old study would have been replicated a few more times and moved in to next stage if it showed any real promise.  Plus cancer is such a diverse disease, in vitro studies may well develop areas of interest and are very necessary but there will never be a one fix for cancer as it\u2019s as different as there are types of cells  I think the best we can do is eat well, exercise and move and if the worst happens we will at lease be in the best shape to help get us through treatment and recovery  ",

      "Content": "Welcome to the forum!  I\u2019m not sure much can be done to prepare as you never really know what side effects you might be blessed with!  Im two rounds in, and happy to report only mild wise effects so far (weekly Paclitaxel and carboplatin every 3) l. Everything I\u2019ve experience has been thankfully short lived as there is usually something to be done to help but frustratingly one can lead to another... last weeks sore gums, helped by mouthwash has made my tastebuds go funny!    I think it\u2019s helped that I have been mentally prepared, taking lots of nice walks, resting when I can and trying to keep things as normal as possible (if slower paced!)  I try to drink loads of water and am being reasonably sensible about food in that I\u2019m conscious to eat veg/fruit plenty of protein and healthy fats but I am eating an astonishing amount of cake too! I\u2019m trying to give my self a break, make sensible choices, move as much as possible and rest when I need to. Doesn\u2019t always work and sounds a lot smugger than I actually am! I allow myself days to cry into my coffee and take my dog into the woods to sear and have a good ugly cry! And the odd G&T when I feel like it! Good luck and  I hope treatment is kind xx",

Feeling quite daunted by the whole thing now I have a plan.  Planning on mentioning something to my 5 year old this week. Am planning on reading the \u2018mummys Lump\u2019 book and just saying I need to go in for hospital to have some medicine each week. I dont think I want to tell him the exact date though as he will probably go home from school that Friday and stay at at his grannies so I don\u2019t want him to worry.  Having some drinks with friends on Friday night, weekend off, hair chop Monday and start chemo Friday! ",

Every day that I say \u2018actually I\u2019m doing ok\u2019 it makes me think I should have gone to work!  I am doing ok, but I am having lot s of naps. Only because I can, while my son is at school. I know emotionally I would struggle with work (I am a chiropractor so quite physical and also a lot of my patients offload a lot of emotional stuff on me too) I\u2019m claiming ESA (or trying too) so I could possibly work up to 4 hours a week, without affecting that. But my jobisnt one where I can just decide to work one day I have to book patients in in advance. My husband is having to pay for everything which I know he is struggling with, and we will probably add to our debt considerably as a result. But what if I say I\u2019ll work a few hours a week and end up not bei able to? ",

Was more eventful than I expected as I had problems with my veins and they couldnt find a cold cap to fit as they only had one large one and it was being used! I had o wait for the lady to finish. Then tey had trouble canulating me. First failed, second ok till half way though carbo then vein had enough! Had some weird local reaction. Then it took 2 hours to get another one in! I\u2019m full of holes! Port fitting next week thank god. I was there 10 hours!  Feel ok this morning but woke up so early! Conscious of \u2018overdoing it\u2019 but not really sure what that is? Might take the dog out in a bit.  Do I take metaclopramide even if I don\u2019t feel nauseous? They said take it 3xdaily for 3 days then as required? But I feel ok so it seems a bit unecessary?  Hope you are all doing ok? ",
