      "Content": "Hiya I'm not massively knowledgeable on the topic but I'll try to help as best I can! Is it definitely flu or could it just be a nasty cold? I'd say for anyone to get full blown flu four times in the space of 18 months wouldn't be normal, I think it may be worth a trip to the doctors to ask them about it, they may suggest a flu jab or something like that to stop her getting it if she seems particularly susceptible to the flu.  All the best and sending positive thoughts ❤️",

      "Content": "My mum was diagnosed last week with breast cancer grade 3. She's had it a good few months now, estimated between 6-10 months. She did to to the doctors when she first noticed it but they didn't refer her, she only got referred second time around. They're checking for any spreading to the lymph nodes, bones, stomach, and chest this week so they can stage it and discuss treatment, we're all a bit nervous given how long she's had it now. The cancerous lump is 2.5cm long, she's not had any symptoms of it having been anywhere else and the lady examining her felt under her arms and couldn't find any lumps there, but it's such a worrying and duanting process.  Can anyone shed some light on this to us please? Many thanks x",
