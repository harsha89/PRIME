      "Content": "One more question, when I had my expander implant put in, i had a mesh put in to support it as well as the implant being put behind the muscle, when the new silicone implant is put in, the incision is under the boob, does it affect the muscle or the mesh ? Sorry, just struggling with the decision. Thank you in advance.",

      "Content": "Hi, when I was diagnosed with breast cancer, I was literally so scared and I wanted to understand from the outset what a cancer looks like. A cancer is a tightening of cells, which were very clear to see on the X-rays they showed me. You must remember the nurses and especially the Nurse Practioners, who are easily almost the same qualified in their field as a doctor,  do this for a job every single day, and are the most qualified to say if you have cancer or not.  I really hope this alleviates your worry slightly. If I was you, I would just keep an eye on it, if anything changes go back, they are a wonderful caring team and will always be there to set your worries aside.  ",

      "Content": "Hi, ive been on tamoxifen a year now.  once you\u2019ve been on them a while everything has settled down for me. The only side effects I feel now, is that I sometimes get leg cramps, but I think I have worked out that one brand of tamoxifen does this and the other doesn\u2019t so I just need to work out which one it is and the pharmacist will order that particular brand that doesn\u2019t cause the cramps in for me each time. i dont like taking any kind of tablets,  but each morning I take them, I feel \u201csafe\u201d if you understand what I mean  stick with it, I\u2019m sure the effects will calm down, and if they don\u2019t, there is an alternative they can put you on, just not quite so effective so I understand.",
