    "Content": "I too have been recently diagnosed and had right mx with node clearance last Wednesday. Back for path results on 6th June. I had a grade 3, 4cm tumour with possible multi focal and 3 lymph nodes looked to be affected from the scans. I try not to think about results as yet, although I will always prepare myself for the worst news, ie that is has spread. Still find it hard that I feel and felt so well and fit yet i have cancer. Since surgery i have lots of nerve disturbance and discomfort under my arm and down my arm, but I guess its normal. Havent been in any pain and the exercises are definitely helping, i have good mobility in my arm and shoulder. I am based on the south coast near Eastbourne if there is anyone else in the area going through the same things. Gill xx",
