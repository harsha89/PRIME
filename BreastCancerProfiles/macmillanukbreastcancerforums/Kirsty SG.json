    "Content": "Thank you.... soooo goood to hear things like that! I have had a roller coaste few years.... maybe somewhat similar to many here. IVF and infertility treatment, a break down in my marriage and relationship of 20years and then cancer diagnosis.... I don't think it is all unrelated either, although doctors seem to like to tell me I am unlucky. I recently bought a sweatshirt from www.hush.com which gave the majority of the proceeds to breast cancer research. It has the word LUCKY embroidered on it and that is how I feel. Lucky to have the information and knowledge to deal with this thing, lucky to be alive, lucky to have friends..... What a crazy journey.... sounds tacky, but what doesn't break us makes us stronger, hey! Love and strength and thanks xx",
