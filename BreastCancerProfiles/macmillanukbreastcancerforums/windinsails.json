I know I did panic about the gap but was assured it was fine. I had all my lymph nodes out as had spread but feel very positive. Hope that helps.",

Does anyone know of a good place to buy a one strapped rucksack with good waist support so that I can still do some long distance walking routes if I feel so inclined in the future? Not sure anyone has so far asked this question! I had all my lymph nodes removed (21 I am told) and want to avoid aggravating any lymphedema issues but don't want breast cancer to stop me in my tracks! ",

When I find a good rucksack though for the longer walks I will definitely let you know. Not great at sorting this website yet so not sure how to add you to my favourites so that I can find you when I find the right rucksack. But I will!!! A x",

I am looking for a good day pack so that I too can carry everything and not rely on partner and others! Ideally one with good support around the waist which takes most of the load anyway. I have been out walking with just the one strap on normal rucksacks, not a good look and all lop sided! x",

I have done lots of long distance walking and lovely day walks and am keen to carry on and not let this thing stop me doing the things I love. I am a relatively fit 50 year old but whatever age I get to I want the choice! I will let you know when I find one that is decent when I have done my research, purchased and tested! Get out to those beautiful hills of yours even for half an hour and cheat by getting to the highest point you can by car!! i took my mum (83) up to near Hay Bluff in the Black Mountains and sat her some 200 metres from the car but a spectacular view with no effort but so good for the soul. She loved the feeling of just being there. Alison x",

I honestly don't think about it too often but the taste in my mouth is  definitely there and noticeable at times. Hey ho! Sorry to hear you are suffering and I hope your doctor can give you some good advice. Not enjoying a cup of tea is the pits! Can I just ask whilst you are there, how long do you have to be on Anastrozole for, is it 5 or 10 years?",

It is mild but slightly annoying.Otherwise I don't seem to have too many side effects (cross fingers) other than stiff joints first thing in the morning which goes once I get moving. One year on and getting on with my life and appreciating it even more! windinsails x",

I am only one year in so mustn't look too far ahead, but I seem to be the other way round from you, Tamoxifen and then another, I guess when I get post menopausal. I was just thinking in my head that after 5 years on Tamoxifen or whatever I might go back to oncologist and get my profile stats run through the machine to see if worth taking for 10 rather than 5 years. Anyway side effects not too bad at the moment. Good luck in your journey . We are certainly not alone!!! ",
