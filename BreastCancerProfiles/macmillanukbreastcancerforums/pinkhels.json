    "Content": "Hi Allison I had a lumpectomy followed by lymph node clearence in jan 2010, i was also diagnosed with tnbc stage 3 grade 3. This was followed by 6 rounds of fec and 4 wks of rads. I still have shooting pains now under my armpit and I believe these can last for many years. Please try and continue with your physio as it really does help, just dont try and push yourself as it does take a while and my arm is still weaker than the other. When it comes to the steroids I also did not take them all. I cannot possibly comment on whether you should take them, if the doctor prescibed them then they are obviously needed, for some reason I just couldn't face putting any more pills in me. Maybe I was silly, I dont know! I was only prescribed them for 3 days after every chemo but just did not want them. I dont know if Ive been any help but I guess its always nice to hear of someone in your shoes. Good luck with rest of your chemo, keep well :) Helen xx    ",
