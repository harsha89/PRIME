      "Content": "Hi Joanne Reading your post brought back the memories for me of last year.  I was diagnosed April 2013 with breast cancer.  My daughter was with me when I was told and whilst she was having a sniffle or two, I sat in total disbelief and all I could think of was I couldn't miss my daughter's wedding (abroad) at the beginning of June! My surgeon and head of my team explained everything to me in easy and understandable dialogue, and wrote things down in a list, which he gave me to take home and refer back to when needed.  My breast screen nurse Helen was so lovely and put everything in perspective.  I then went away and told everyone, spoke very openly about it and learned that I was not on my own and the more I talked the more I learned that many people were or had gone through what I was about to go through. I found I gained confidence and faith that I was being looked after by the best people possible and due to all the research and the wonderful specialists in this field I was going to win this battle. It is now almost a year on from when I had my surgery (mastectomy to the left breast with immediate implant), which was on 18 June 2013 and I am getting my life back.  I am back at work, been on a long overdue family holiday with my partner and my two step daughters and I feel happy. I will never forget the months of treatment and how it made me feel, but I am so glad I stuck with it and put my total trust in my medical team.  When I went for my 6 month check and mammogram (to just the right breast) and was told all appeared fine and I do not need to go back for a year I was elated, I have put it behind me now and moved on and it feels great. Don't bottle things up, learn to talk it out and tell your medical team if you are worried or concerned about anything, they are there to help you and make you better. Keep smiling and I wish you all the very best Much love and hugs Wendi x",

      "Content": "Hi there Yes like everyone on here I am sorry to hear that you are going through a worrying time just now. I went for a routine mammogram last March (the 50-70 call up). I made a joke about it at the time because I am only 49!  However, am I so glad that I kept that appointment as at the beginning of April I was told the awful news that they had found a lump to be cancerous. Like you I was aware of this lump already and I had it checked out 2 years previous.  They did a mammogram then, a physical examination and too a fluid biopsy.  I was told at that time it was nothing to worry about and so nothing further was done. 2 years on and that same lump was found to be cancerous, which showed up after having actual tissue removed and examined.  After further tests and scans I was informed that my lymph glands were also showing signs of cancer cells so was booked in for a mastectomy and lymph node removal. Don't get too disheartened though as things aren't always as bleak as you imagine.  After examining my tumour I was diagnosed with a stage 2 cancer that was called mucinous.  Although it had spread to the lymph nodes it was a slow growing/spreading cancer, which is very treatable.  I am half way through my chemotherapy now and do not have to have radiotherapy, so will be finished by the end of November and will be on hormone tablets/3 monthly injections for 5 years. This site has been extremely helpful to me through my journey as well as having an excellent medical team behind me.   Stay positive and focused, but try not to worry at this stage.  whatever the outcome the breakthrough in ways of treating this is great for all concerned and you will get the very best medical help to combat this. hugs and best wishes Wendi ",

At the beginning it seemed such a long way off to reach the end, but you will be surprised how quickly the weeks in between go and at each treatment date you can say, 'there is another one done'.  Before you know it you are nearing your last one and that light at the end of the tunnel is much brighter. It is so worth the effort when you get to the end, the feeling of triumph and victory is immense and the load you shed off your shoulders gives you a real sense of relief. Good luck with your journey and wishing you a happy Christmas and very best wishes and good health for 2014 Wendi xxxx ",

The problem I am now faced with is the girl who has stepped in to 'look after' my job in my absence has slowly taken over.  I am employed as a P/A, but since my return I have been treated like a typist!  I am continually told that things have changed and they do things differently now.  The girl doing my job has been kept on and her sister is head of accounts and also has the role of Practice manager. Slowly but surely I feel I am being pushed from pillar to post, one day being sent to work in one department and then sent to work somewhere else the next!  It is all more than a little disconcerting and I can't help feeling surplus to requirements now and that what they really want to do is let me go. Has anyone else found returning to work uncomfortable or felt uneasy with how people treat them?  I am so worried, I can't afford to lose my job.  I have been with them 8 years now and have always enjoyed it, but lately I feel the pressure on and the atmosphere in my actual office has changed so much I feel I don't belong anymore",

      "Content": "Thank you all so much for your comments, it appears that coping with your return to work affects more people than I realised.  It really does seem to be a problem that employers are not addressing. I have to say that like some of you have experienced, my employers have also been supportive and I was kept on full pay for the 6 months, but that did come at the price of being reminded by my boss (the director I am supposed to be P/A for) that he was down financially and how hard it was with money going out and nothing coming in! I was informed by the Practice Manager, (the sister of the girl who stepped in to 'look after' my job) that my job was safe that she was dealing with it like a 'reverse maternity leave' and that when I was ready I could return to my desk and pick up where I left off.  So far that just hasn't happened and when I did actually raise this with her she fobbed me off, said she would call a meeting in our office to discuss how we move on and who was responsible for what role.  That meeting never occurred and that was at the beginning of January!   I am now being moved around different departments whilst my 'stand in' gets on with doing my job!  We had appraisals this week and whilst I was kept to my strict 20 minutes the other girl was in discussing things for over an hour.  I have to say at this point that yes, it was our practice manager, the girls sister who was carrying out all the appraisals and no one seemed to think it odd that a family member was appraising her own sister! I have to say I am so sorry to hear you have been made redundant Karan and I am afraid that this is what my employers are aiming at for me.  I am now keeping a diary and having to be very careful what I do and say and I am not allowed to enjoy sharing a joke with my colleagues as we used to do before I went off sick.  Things have changed and it is making me feel so insecure.  I shall read the booklet G & J, thank you for your advice.",

I had my last chemo on 25 November and still suffer from a dry mouth and also congested, dry nose. Some days I just can't get enough water, feeling really thirsty, but I think about the good water does for your body and giving you a right good flush that I don't really mind it.  It is more annoying when you wake up feeling like your mouth is full of gloop and no amount of brushing my teeth helps it at all. I have gone for chewing gum and found that helps a bit, it stimulates the saliva and freshens your mouth at the same time. I haven't spoken to any of the nurses or oncology team, I just seem to be in the frame of mind that everything that happens now that I didn't have problems of before is down to after effects of chemo and just accept it.  Not sure this is the right way forward or not. Take care and hope all gets sorted out soon xx",

I have read through a book about chemotherapy and it does say that for the first few days the drugs can be passed on through bodily fluids and blood.  Obviously have to be careful during these days, but otherwise it should be okay afterwards. 2 more days to go before I hear what my treatment regimen will be, all this waiting just kills me.

      "Content": "Hi Trina I had my mastectomy operation on 18 July (Tuesday), as well as having lymph nodes removed.  Initially I had two drains attached but the axillary drain was removed on the Friday before I left the hospital.  I went home with the drain for my breast still connected and a note for the district nurse for when she called round to check it and perhaps change the bottle.  The district nurse called in to see me on the Saturday and that was it, I didn't see her again!!!!  I had an appointment at the hospital for a check up, but they left the drain as it was and did not change the bottle or suggest having it removed.  By the Wednesday the bottle was getting quite full so I contacted my district nurse who was unable to change the bottle because they do not have spare ones and I was given any spares when I left the hospital!! My surgeon had suggested to me that he preferred the drain to remain in place for at least 2 weeks.  I had to stay in hospital slightly longer as well due to a lot of swelling, above the normal swelling.  Maybe this was why he suggested leaving the drain in longer to avoid fluid accumulating in the breast area. All I know is that it was extremely irritating having to take the drain bottle with you everywhere.  However, my breast screen nurse gave me a super fabric bag that had been made especially to keep the bottle in so I was able to become hands free when getting about!  I think we learn that at times it is the small things that make all the difference. Good luck with everything, best wishes and much love  ",

Anyway, that part is all behind me now.  A bit frustrating at the time, but I am moving on and looking ahead at what else I need to do to concur this fight.  It is the winning of the small battles that will eventually win the war!  I just take each day as it comes, try to stay focused and positive and eventually the day will come when I will be able to get back to normal and put this all behind me. I hope all is well with everyone and that you are all managing to deal with your experiences without it getting you too down. Much love and hugs xxxx ",

I started chemo on 29 July and I am having TAC.  I was told that the type of treatment I was having my hair would definately fall out.  I decided against the cold cap, I just didn't feel this was for me, so I braced myself and arranged with my 28 year old daughter for her to come round and shave my hair prior to starting treatment. A colleague at work suggested I donate my hair to be used for children's wigs.  I went online and found a charity called The Little Princess Trust.  They provided information on how to cut and pack your hair to send off to them.  My daughter plaited my hair and secured it, then cut each plait off and shaved the rest very short.  I had my wigs at the ready and a soft headwear cap and scarves.  It was a little scary, but I would rather that than go through the emotional trauma of seeing my hair drop out.  I have had my second treatment and my hair has almost gone, I am left with what I call my baby hair!.  However on a very positive note I received a lovely thank you certificate from the Little Princess Trust for my hair donation.  I was filled with immense satisfaction that something good had come out of my experience.

      "Content": "Hi Chris I was first diagnosed back at the end of April.  At first the felt it was only a small lump and that we were looking at a lumpectomy and radiotherapy with Tamoxifen for 5 years.  However, they sent me for an MRI scan and what showed up meant I had to go back for further biopsies.  The results of these showed the cancer to be in the lymph nodes and a further area on the other side of the nipple was also affected. We were then looking at something slightly more involved and as such I had a mastectomy on 18 June and I also had 11 lymph nodes removed from under my arm. I am to start chemotherapy on 29 July and will have 6 sessions then move onto tablets.  I am unable to take Tamoxifen so my oncologist has said that there is an alternative tablet with monthly injections as a back up. Everyone's situation appears to be quite different from the next person and there does not seem to be any logic to cancer and how it is affecting different people.  Even the treatment that is suggested to each person seems to be slightly different.  That is why I try not to get too hung about it and stay positive that my team of professionals understand my personal situation and are treating it the best way they know how. This site is excellent to keep 'abreast' (pardon the pun) of how people are facing up to their own diagnosis and there are a lot of helpful tips from people who have either completed their treatment or who are still going through treatment. I have never felt caught up in such a whirlwind as this before, it is certainly an eye opener.  Talking about cancer and dealing with it each day it is like being part of another world/planet.  The terminology and abbreviations can be quite confusing at times! I hope all goes well for you, I shall keep an eye out for other posts to see how you are getting on. Best wishes  xxxx  ",

The medications we refer to here are specific to cancers that are triggered by oestrogen or progesterone.  The medication that is prescribed prevent your body producing the type of hormone that is causing the cells to change and become cancerous. Your type of cancer may not be affected by hormones within your body, so you would have no need to take them. Please though speak to your medical team, they will be able to explain things much better for your own particular circumstances. Best wishes and hugs Wendi x ",
