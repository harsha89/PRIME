    "Content": "Hi there Ive been on Tamoxifen for 3 years and was considered pre menopausal at diagnosis(48 with previous hysterectomy so no periods) Due to the side effects I asked my oncologist about changing to an aromatose inhibitor. I told her my GP had checked my hormone status and was waiting on the results. Her reply was that due to the Tamoxifen this result would not be 100% and would not change my medication. She said I would have to be given Zoladex injections along with this other drug and she was not willing to go there. Her other option was to stop the Tamoxifen and take my chances!! I chose to continue with the Tamoxifen as did not want to increase my chances of a recurrence as I have recently had my kidney removed due due to a new primary cancer. Not sure if any of this information helps. Regards Ann x",
