      "Content": "Hi Topsy, I had DCIS diagnosis April 2010 and two ops - second to clear the margin and lymph node test which came back negative.  Mine was also oestrogen fed.  Had my radiotherapy through 3 weeks in August and started Tamoxifen in June.  All went okay - please try not to worry about radiotherapy but also do not underestimate that you will begin to feel tired as it has a cumulative effect - mine made me feel like I had run out of petrol! however I was still trying to go to the gym and do various daft things! Also my oncologist would not let me get anything on my breast other than Johnsons Baby soap during the treatment and 3 weeks after, this made showering difficult and hair washing over the bath, but I had no trouble with soreness so not sure if this was the reason. Good luck I will be thinking about you - I have had two check ups since and each time been lucky enough to have a scan which is very reassuring but you are right it is always at the back of your mind but you have caught it really early and you will beat it - take care x    ",

      "Content": "What a worrying time, I was diagnosed 3 months ago and have found the waiting for results and the differing advice given from breast nurse, surgeon etc., to be so confusing - I am a naturally inquisitive person and always wanted the worst scenario explained which I dont think helped! I start my radiotherapy tomorrow and to this point have had two lumpectomys and a sentinel node biopsy (blue dye injected which I had an allergic reaction to and looked like someone from the film Avatar!)  I personally found the meeting with my oncologist, ironically the last meeting with a professional, to be the most helpful - he explained it all and I really did believe him.  However as someone else has said this is when they have all the tests back and can give you a truly informed decision. As difficult as it is to do, I would advise you to try not to jump to any conclusions until results - all cancers are as individual as your dna - the results will come and so will your treatment plan.  In the meantime if you have a breast nurse request a meeting and make a list of all these questions you have - you deserve answers. Hope this helps a bit sorry i have dribbled on a bit - difficult to put it all into words  x",
