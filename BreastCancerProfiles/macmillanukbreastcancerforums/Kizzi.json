      "Content": "I was diagnosed with invasive lobular Breast cancer in 2014 Sept, started 3 sessions of fec and 3 tax, also have her 2 protein, I only managed 16 herceptin due to echo results being low. I had masetomy and reconstruction of the right Breast.   On the 20th April I had an appointment at the beast care clinic, the doctor asked me if I had been taking any medication ie tamoxifen, zoladex, exemestane, which I said no I hadn't hurd of these med's before.  He wrote to the oncology dept, and told me to contact them directly, I called for 2 weeks without anyone getting back to me, then received an appointment in the post, 5th may 2016.  The doctor apologised and said he didnt understand how I've been missed and I should have been taking tamoxifen for the past year.  Now that I've have some time to process this I feel really upset and angry, I'm only 34 I've just been getting my body back to feel relitively normal, and now going to have to start messing about with it again.  Not sure if I'm going to be able to cope with the side effects, and I don't want my children to have to see me feeling ill again. ",
