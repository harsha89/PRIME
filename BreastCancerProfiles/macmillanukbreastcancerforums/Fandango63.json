    "Content": "Good morning, Like you I had a mastectomy and reconstruction due to high grade DCIS, but no lymph node removal.  I was not warned that there may have been a chance that invasive cancer could be found.  When I went for my results, expecting to be given the all clear, I was told that there were some small scattered areas of invasive cancer within the DCIS. Due to the pathology (HER2+, ER+) I am having a 12 week course of adjuvant chemotherapy as a preventative measure, with Herceptin injections for one year followed by Tamoxifen.  To the best of my oncologist's knowledge, there is no evidence that I have secondary cancer. The oncologist and nurses have been fantastic, and I am sure yours are too!  I also attend a breast cancer support group at my hospital. One thing I have learned there is that all our stories are different, and what has happened to me will not necessarily happen to you - including any post-surgery treatment. Stay strong, and good luck for next week!",
