      "Content": "Hi, I was diagnosed in Dec 2011, had a lumpectomy, Also had lymph node clearance, where only one was infected out of 20 removed.  I had 6 Tax Chemo, and 18 rads.  Am now on Aromasin for five years.  My breast has been full of fluid since I finished the rads.  Have been back to hosp numerous times, also had mammograms done, but everything clear.  Surgeon and Onc have said it's a bad reaction to the rads, and it will eventually disappear, but at the moment the breast is very sore, especially at night when turning over in the bed. I am now taking pain killers to ease the pain.  Sorry can't help you anymore. Take care, Yvonne",

I found it hard to cope with losing the hair in the beginning, but I got used to it, and now even go out with no wig or hair covering when the weather is warm. Hope you get on ok. Yvonne",

      "Content": "Hi, I had six sessions of Tax and cyclophosphamide.  Finished them at the end of May.  I was given loads of anti sickness medication which worked.  Another side effect of it I had, was very sore bones, for which I was give ibrofen and other pain killers, also had very sore mouth, and lost all sense of taste for a while. I had my treatment in Ireland. This was followed by 18 rads.  I did get bad burns from this treatment, on my breast, underneath, and also in my neck.  The hosp did give me cream to put on after each treatment, and up to three times a day.  One of the burns blistered, so that had to be dressed by the local doc everyday, as they were worried in case infection set in, but eventually this all healed.  Still have swollen breast from the rads though.  My surgeon saw me last Thurs, and said this was normal, and could take a couple of months to clear up.

      "Content": "Hi, The cream was Aqueous, the hospital supplied me with loads of it!!!  I would shower before treatment, and as soon as I finished, while I was changing, I would put loads of it on me, and then a few more times during the day.  Hospital also told me to bathe my breast with camoline tea.  Used to make up a pint jug of it every day, and bathe my breast with it and also the surrounding area. Did ease the burns a little. Though treatment is finished now, I still feel very tired everyday, and need to have a daily rest in the pm.  I am now taking Arimidex, which does give me hot flushes and my joints do tend to seize up, when I am sitting for any length of time.

Hope you get on ok with the Tax. Yvonne",

Also my eyebrows have started thinning. I have always had straight hair, and a few days after the chemo it started going curly, and everyone was asking if I had it permed!!! Hoping it will come back curly!  Have bought some lovely hats, turbans and bandanas. As Tibbty says, I do find it hard to lose my eyebrows, have come to terms with the hair coming out.

      "Content": "Hi, I started my chemo beginning of Feb, just had my 4th one last Tuesday.  Two more to go. First refused chemo as I could not get my head around losing my hair.  Well, eventually decided that my health came first, and my hair started coming out with two & half weeks of first chemo!  I had a wig fitted before the hair came out, so it matched my hair, and now I get compliments on my hair style from people who do not know that it's a wig!  Also have lots of hats and scarves to match my outfits.  At home family and friends are used to seeing me with no hair now, even the grandchildren when visiting don't take any notice anymore. I go to work everyday for four to five hours, I know I am lucky as we have our own workplace, and I can pick and choose my hours, but I feel that I need to work to keep myself sane, and not sit at home and start thinking about everything that could happen.  I am on Taxadore and a couple of days after treatment bone ache sets in, and then I have to rest for a couple of days, but most days I seem to get by ok.  My way of dealing with my breast cancer is to try to keep everything normal, and to keep going and doing all the things I would normally do.  I did tell the docs that the treatment had to fit into my life, and not the other way round, and for me that is working up to now. Hope you get on ok Yvonne",
