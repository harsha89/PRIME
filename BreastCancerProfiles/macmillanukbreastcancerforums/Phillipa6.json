      "Content": "A few weeks after I started to take Tamoxifen I noticed I started to have heartburn, something I have only suffered from when I was pregnant over 24 years ago.  I later started to belch.  My G.P. Prescribed Lansoprazole which has had some good effect but wondered whether others have experienced this.  ",

      "Content": "Hi grannylara thank you for your reply.  it\u2019s comforting to know other ladies have had the same side effects on tamoxifen My gp has referred me to the gastro team and I\u2019m now awaiting an endoscopy.  It feels like a constant round of tests and more tests and although I am so grateful for all the care I have had I do find them anxiety provoking now.  I\u2019m sure ladies on here understand that.  But Thank you you again for your support and advise and I see my oncologist soon and will also mention it there. Sending love and hugs to you and I hope your treatment goes well.  Take care Phillipa6xxxx",
