      "Content": "Hi vonnie  I have had similar problems with my fingers and hands, I couldn't grip things and had no strength, I also had bad pains in my arms elbows and ankles, these started when I started taking tamoxifen 9 months ago . My consultant is adamant it is not the tamoxifen but after affects of the chemo therapy ? Not sure I'm convinced but it has eased off enough for me to go back to work now x It comes and goes more now x Sara  x",

Good luck x",

      "Content": "Hi I was wondering if anyone has been advised to have there ovaries removed after being diagnosed with ER+ breast cancer ?   I was diagnosed 12months ago with stage III ER+ breast cancer in my left breast, I had a mastectomy and chemotherapy FEC-T and am now on tamoxifen.  I had not had any periods since Oct when I had my 1st Fec so presumed as I had been told the chemo had thrown me into the menopause, then suddenly 3 weeks ago I got a period really heavy, horrid, I was having blood tests done so I made the doc do one to see if I was menopausal, it came back I am not menopausal so I panicked because when I was told I had cancer I was told to have my coil taken out because it had a small amount of hormones in it and hormones feed my cancer so all I can think as reasonable or unreasonable as it may be is that if I am not menopausal my hormone levels are higher than they would be if I was menopausal. To cut a long story short/shorter he he   I rang oncologist to ask, all they said was your consultant says you are on the correct meds.... I know that!!!   I just wanted to know whether ovary removal was an option as I am not there to see him till Oct. Has anyone been through similar or had this suggested to them ?? Many thanks Sara xxxx",

      "Content": "      Many thanks, think I will have to wait and discuss it with my oncologist in Oct it has never been discussed with me as I think maybe me being 45 I am near to the age when menopause starts and when they spoke it was as if it was inevitable, so will have to wait and see what he says,  think I would feel better with them gone anything that reduces the risk of it coming back is good by me. Thanks again xx",
