    "Content": "Just read your comments Bigburd33. I have this side effect - some days worse than others. Really depressing me now. Did you find it settled down? I\u2019ve been on tamoxifen now for nearly 2 years (this effect getting worse) with a gao in between as I couldn\u2019t cope with the joint aches. Pain seems less on Teva but more hot flushes, night sweats and the added bladder thing. Totally wondering if it\u2019s all worth it.  hope you\u2019re doing better with the Milan. ",
