      "Content": "Hi there ... bless ya, it is a really worrying time, and your hormones are probably all over the place ... and looking after your baby ... what l would say is far more lumps are negative then positive .. my first 4 call backs were fatty lumps and they said l had very lumpy boobs ... and every time I'd worried sick for nothing ... it really does help to keep busy, and with baby that shouldn't be too hard ... l know it's easier said then done ... but everything about our breast lumps is waiting ... for appointments / tests / operations / results ... l think that's why they call it a \"waiting room\" and wer called \"patients\" coz that's what we have to have lots of ... Try not to say what if and please don't Google symptoms as you put in sneezing and Google will tell you , you've only got weeks left ... l used McMillan help line while l was waiting , and it really helped me .. so hunny got everything crossed for you .. hold on and you'll get there ... take care of your heart, and be kind to yourself and know we all go through those feelings while waiting ...
