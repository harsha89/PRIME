      "Content": "I wonder if anyone can give me any advice? I finished my chemo in May 2013, all my hair had fell out within a couple of weeks of starting the treatment. Now almost 8 months later, it has grown back in most places but is really thin almost patchy in on my crown and at the front. The surrounding hair is grown longer now, but there is no sign of the 'missing areas' growing. Im not really worried that It wont grow back at all. I look like a balding man. I feel quite guilty worrying about considering what others have to worry about, but still, I hate to think Im always going to look like this.",
