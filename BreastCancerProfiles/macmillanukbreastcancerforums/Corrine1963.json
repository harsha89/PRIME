Hope this helps!",

      "Content": "Hi Mandy Cant help with the zoladex I'm afraid but I've been taking tamoxifen since end November 2010.  For me the immediate side effects were not pleasant - night sweats, hot flushes, aching legs - I used to have to hobble down the stairs one at a time and if I sat still too long I'd be hobbling too. I'd say its taken a good six months for me to get settled - the night sweats are few and far between, still get a couple of hot flushes each day (compared to 5 or 6) and although my legs not quite back to normal they are miles better.  I'm not sure if they have affected my moods because I always was a bit moody anyway :-) Have you spoken to your BCN about any possible alternatives?",

      "Content": "Hello I didnt have herceptin or any scans at the end of treatment either.  I had chemo and then a lumpectomy followed by radiotherapy and now take tamoxifen.  I was told after the op and axillary clearance that there was a clear margin (no cancerous cells remained) and was given scans prior to treatment to ensure it hadn't spread (which it hadn't).  After my first post treatment mammogram I was told there was 'no evidence of disease'.  I think being told you are 'in remission' in very much dependent on the hospital - I phoned my key nurse to ask the same question and she said they dont really use the word remission for breast cancer but that technically I was 'cancer free'.  I also think that technically i dont get the 'all clear' until 5 years is up.  Do you have a key nurse you could phone to check?  If nothing else it would put your mind at rest. Good luck.",

      "Content": "Hi Jules I managed to work through most of my chemotherapy - as my side effects were cumulative I found that for the 3rd and 4th cycle of each (EC and Taxol) I was unable to work as normal - I had chemo on the Friday and then had the Mon-Wed the following week off sick.  For the earlier ones I worked at home on the Mon and Tues and travelled to work as normal on the Wed.  I worked throughout radiotherapy and just had the time off for hospital appointments.  I had no real side effects in terms of tiredness - to be honest I didnt feel tired at all.  I did have some minor skin blistering though - but it was very minor and the hospital gave me dressings and gel which really helped. My one motto during treatment was 'if I can, I will, if I can't, I won't'. Dont push yourself too hard and rest when you need to - listen to what your body is telling you - especially during the chemo stage. You need to do what you feel you can, nothing more. Good luck and hope all goes well. xx",

Its a bit like being told I shouldn't have my legs waxed or my feet pedicured as I have diabetes - twaddle.  If it ever got to the point that I had neuropathy and couldn't feel my legs or feet then I may think again, but all the time I am feeling normal (well as normal as I can under the circumstances lol) then I dont even fess up to having it. I can understand the need to be sensible here in terms of massage - it's just a shame that there is so much nonsense to be found! Take care xx",

Good luck with finding a massage person who knows what they are talking about ;-)",

I still say its a small price to pay. I'd tell the mammo nurses how you feel - I did.  Good luck - let me know how it goes - mine came back NED which was a great relief!",
