I will look into this if i know i am definitely going  Take care and I hope your next op goes well Fissi xx",

      "Content": "Annie That's great news that it's non invasive. I think in your position I would be happy to give up the holiday and get the rads done without delay. Then you can move on and perhaps get away when it's all over. I've spoken to so many people who have been though it, about chemo and they have all said if it is offered or they give you the choice just go for it. It may not be as bad as you think. But like I say I won't know for definite until I see the oncologist and as you know in this game things can change pretty quickly. Good luck on the 11th and I wish you a speedy recovery Fissi Xx",

      "Content": "After discussing with my BCN and surgeon it appears there isn't a problem as there is a delay with seeing the oncologist and getting rads sorted so if that is all i need it can be done on my return.  Having said that it is,looking more likely that i may go down the chemo route as i am in rhe gray area  for recurrence and obviously want to give myself the best chance of ut not returning or spreading and a holiday will set me up for whatever i have to go through As far as travel insurance goes i rang my insurance compamy today and because i took out the policy before any symptoms and diagnosis i am covered for this trip. For any future trips i will have to declare it as a pre-exsisting condition and either pay any charges but what the hell will just be grateful that i am around to go on holiday.   BEST WISHES Fissi xx",

      "Content": "Hi everyone Don't know if there is anyone that can give me some advice. I am 54 and found a lump in my breast in April. My doctor quckly referred me to the breast clinic and after the usual tests we were looking at a 2cm grade 2 IDC with lymph nodes looking ckear. I mentioned that i had holiday booked in July and was advised that i would need a WLE and radiation and we should be able to complete the treatment to enasble me to go away as planned. Had my surgery on 13th Msy and have recovered well and return to work tomorrow. I have been informed that they got a ckear margin and the nodes are ckear and that I am ER positive as i expected but that the cancer was grade 3 and so more aggressive. This means the possibility of chemo which will be discussed when i meet the oncologist. That is where the probkem starts as i got my appointment date on Saturday and it it not until the 19th June. This means,that if I only need Radiotherapy there will nit be time to fit in 3 weeks before i go on holiday and i have read that you shouldn't delay radiotherapy as it increases the chances of a recurrance  If i am to have chemo it's not so much of a problem as i know i can delay for a few weeks. Has anyone else had to delay radiotherapy abd for how long? I know it sounds,selfish when i have been very lucky compared to a lot if you on here but i hqve been looking forward to to his for,so long and it has given me something to ficus on over the last few weeks. It' just been a psin that it's happened over the bank holiday weekend when i can't contact my BCN ",

      "Content": "I was diagnosed in April and had WLE and radiotherapy, ER+ so tablets for 5 years. Anyway as to the topic of travel insurance. Someone at work put me on to Avanti and i got a reasonable policy for a week in Ibiza next year. This was after AXA refusing to cover the cancer and SAGA wanting to charge through the nose. I think it is not a case of us being taken ill while we are away, but we are more likely to cancel due to unexpected problems relating from the cancer Haven't tried for anything else yet so cannot help with mortgages, critical illness etc. Hope this helps xx",
