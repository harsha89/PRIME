      "Content": "Hi there, I saw the plastic surgeon last week about recon. She seemed very keen on a LD (back) flap with a small implant behind. I was all for it until I read a few horror stories on here, and discovered it's a 6-7 hour operation. She said expanders and implants alone often cause problems with capsulation and don't look as natural. Now I'm in a complete quandary and need to decide relatively soon. Would any of you who have had either procedure please let me know your thoughts and experiences?  Many, many thanks in advance. Coco x",

If you were comparing it to your original mastectomy, was it much more painful? Lastly, do you have any pain now? I've read about people having nerve pain long after. Sorry to quiz you! Thanks again.

I was wondering, if my score comes back high, would a second mastectomy of remaining breast be as effective as having chemo? I've searched for info to no avail. I guess a call to bcn would answer it, but wondered if anyone had any knowledge or experience of this? Thank you in advance. Keep warm everyone! Cxx",

      "Content": "Hi there, I get my Oncotyppe results tomorrow so I'll let you know!  Almost identical diagnosis as yours, although my 1.8cm IDC was grade 2 but I also had large areas of high grade DCIS (2.5+5.5cm) I did a lot if reading beforehand about the choices that I might face. I am a little different as I'm thinking if I'm in the 'dreaded grey area' I will opt for no chemo. That's how I feel right now, but I will take advice I guess and that may change.  I looked at a US forum community@breast cancer.org where there are many accounts of Oncotype experiences. Bear in mind though that US treatment may differ. Having a glass of wine to calm my nerves before tomorrow.  All the best - I really empathise! keep posting!. Xx",

      "Content": "Hi,  Hi. I read your post with interest. I think I have a similar situation as regards diagnosis at least. ER+ 8/8 Grade 2 IDC tumour with an additional large area (5.5+cm) of DCIS. No lymph nodes involved. Ended up with a mastectomy. Consultant at follow up this week said in his opinion no chemo was needed. I asked to have the Oncotype test which he agreed to reluctantly. He said that that if I get a high result \"You'll think you'll need chemo, and I don't think it'll make a difference, it's just a statistical 'best' guess\" This seems an unusual attitude. I'd be very interested to follow what informs your end decision and what your Oncologist says. I'm sorry if this is unhelpful to you. I suspect I may have the same dilemma in a couple of weeks so hope you feel my support for you!  Thanks for posting and all the best. Xx",
