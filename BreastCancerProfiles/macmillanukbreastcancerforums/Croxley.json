I felt like I shouldn't have been there and they were only doing the scan to pacify me. However it wasn't me who ordered the scan!! I discussed various lumps with the surgeon and he ordered the scan.  I am probably being over sensitive but I just find all of this so stressful. Definitely don't want to be scanned again to be told off!! Of course I'm worried, I have been treated for breast cancer, why would I not be worried!!! But they didn't seem to get that!  So sorry moan over just needed to rant.",

I didn't want to go in the first place as I was so anxious but now just feel so fed up like I'm wasting everyone's time.

      "Content": "Lisa Mc Hi Croxley, I had an expander fitted at the same time as mx in June 2015. In July 2016 had expander replaced with silicone and reduction and uplift on other side done at same time. Both surgeries went very well. No issues with healing and little pain. As you say in clothes, bra etc all looks the same. However when I look down neither of my boobs look like 'mine' now! I did think long and hard about whether to have the other one done but as one was pointing forward and one pointing down lol I thought it was silly not to as I was being offered it. I have to say I do feel very lucky to have had such a brilliant surgeon and I am sure I will get used to them both in time and for me was a much better option than no implant at all. I can have a nipple made on the mx side when I next c surgeon although I don't think I will bother now. It really is quite amazing what they can do for us . Good luck and hope this helps Lisa Mc   Sorry more questions, did you loose any feeling or sensation on the side you had the up lift?? As I have no sensation at all on mastectomy side and really worried that if I do anything to the other side may loose feeling there as well.  Has anyone else had loss of sensation on other side following any surgery for evening things up.",
