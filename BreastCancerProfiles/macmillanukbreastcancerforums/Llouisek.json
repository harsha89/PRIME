      "Content": "Hello, I have just been diagnosed with secondary breast cancer in my shoulder bone. Huge shock as only last month they told me all scans were CLEAR?! I was experiencing pain in my left shoulder which I had told to my BCN, oncologist and GP prior to having the MRI. It wasn\u2019t until I myself requested an X-Ray to see what else could be causing such pain, which is what showed up the strange area. Am waiting on a bone biopsy but is pretty certain it is what it is. I am so angry that this has gone undiagnosed untill now and although it wouldn\u2019t change the out come, I wouldn\u2019t have felt so relieved to then hear the worst news.  Am wondering if anybody else has secondary in the bones and what treatment you\u2019ve had and how you are coping now etc? Am 29 years old and 17 weeks pregnant so really struggling with decisions moving forward.  Thanks  Laura",
