      "Content": "Hi everyone. I was diagnosed in June and had a masectomy and will start chemo in next couple of weeks. The shock of it all, the lack of knowledge and information from the hospital is truly overwhelming. But I have almost got my head around it now with so much help from family, friends and this site. I wholeheartedly agree with making lists of questions and taking someone els with you to every appointment to support you and listen with you. It is surprising how two people can understand one statement so differently! Keep strong and good luck. Mother goose",

As far as you saying about dogs, I cannot agree more my cocker spaniel has been my constant companion and is nick named velcro dog as she is never far away from me. Wonderful creatures. Kindest regards Mother goose",
