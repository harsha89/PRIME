I hope all goes well for you and thank you for your advice, it really means so much and has helped me so much today with all the replies...  Tasha x ",

The surgeon has not offered node clearance he said he would presume chemo but he's not the oncologist, and he would take chemo if offered, but he said the only operating he will be doing again is to get the clear margin... im so confused by what it all means with the nodes.",

I just hope all the delay in getting to actually see the oncologist doesn't affect anything. its hard not knowing if it has spread, when we were told Monday he literally just said two sentinel nodes were taken and both had cancer and that's all we know about the nodes. ",

      "Content": "Hi Recommended to post on here by a very helpful Dreamthief who also gave me some very helpful feedback, hopefully anyone who has been in same position could also give me some advice, all very much appreciated... Hoping someone can help, my mum was diagnosed with breast cancer and had lumpectomy and 2 sentinel nodes removed, the surgeon said that the margins are not clear and she needs to go back in to have a shaving more taken off (he said margin was 0.4mm and not 1mm) they said the nodes looked ok from the ultrasound and couldn't feel anything, so we were shocked to receive the news that both nodes removed do show cancer. We haven't been told much more than this, other than now she will have to have the operation to get the margin. Do they do scans to see if cancer has spread elsewhere? she was told it was early stages when she went, the cancer was 3cm in size and the surgeon said he would say it will be chemo she is offered but his words were, he is a surgeon not an oncologist... so whilst the shock is sinking in, we do not know what to expect from here on in, sick with worry it feels like the future is uncertain and we can't move forwards..... any advice from anyone who has had similar situation would be hugely appreciated...... Also, sorry another question, does it spread fast once it is in the sentinel nodes? Thank you  ",

      "Content": "Thank you very much for your reply, I think I automatically assumed it had spread and didn't fully understand that the sentinel nodes could have trapped it. I really appreciate hearing your journey, we have all sorts of worry and not knowing what is going on a the moment, as we haven't really been explained that much. We are due to go back to see the surgeon tomorrow, we went Monday and he only had provisional results 70% re the margin, but he confirmed the 2 sentinel nodes he took both had cancer in them and that he suggested that chemo would probably be used for those, but he couldn't say much more being the surgeon... he did say when he operates again to get the clear margin he will only be operating in the one area, so looks as if no plans to remove any further nodes. Thank you for your kind words.",

      "Content": "Thank you so much for all the replies. The surgeon said he will not be touching the nodes at all and that chemo and radiotherapy would be used. She has to go in on the 23rd February to get the clear 1mm margin at the moment it is 0.4mm. We did get these results but I am searching the net now trying to get more info on what they mean, if anyone could help explain would be very grateful. This is what we have been told: G2: Ductual Carcinoma PT2: 23mm Whole tumour size: 24.5mm PN/(sn) 1: 2/2 ER: 8/8 HER 2: Negative  Many thanks again, really appreciate how helpful everyone has been  Tasha ",
