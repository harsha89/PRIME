      "Content": "hi penny, everyone is different and your treatment will be tailor made for you, I also was diagnosed with grade 3 invasive breast cancer and last Friday I had a lumpectomy and node biopsy, im now on day 8 since op and today I feel great today ,my breast is yellowing from bruising and feels like ive been kicked by a horse ,my armpit incision was more sore though ,ive only needed paracetamol though. just waiting for my results Thursday to see what is next, hopefully no more surgery and straight on with chemo ,ive chosen not to return to work until all treatment on advise from the bcn as my job had a high risk of catching a virus as I work with small children. the way I see it is if I live to 80 (im 34 now) and this is what I have to deal with for a year ,then its worth it xxxxxxxxxxxx",
