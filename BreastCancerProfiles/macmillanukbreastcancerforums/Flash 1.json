      "Content": "hello everyone, I\u2019m new to the group and awaiting results of a core biopsy.Â  I received my first mammogram invite appointment at age 53 nearly 4 weeks ago. After 3 weeks I received a letter asking me to return, problem was that the appointment had passed! I phoned to make another appointment which was scheduled for 5 days later. Longest 5 days of my life (mum died of breast cancer aged 50), but in the back of my mind I was telling myself it was because they had nothing to compare against, When I arrived for my appointment I was told that \u201cmy name was not on the list\u201d. I calmly said, \u201cwell you had better put it on, I\u2019ll sit here and wait\u201d I was lucky, (think clinic had finished) and I was taken straight through for another mammogram then through to ultrasound. The radiologist said that the 2nd mammogram looked better (no idea what first showed)! But as she began scan a lot of clicking happened, she then said, I\u2019m concerned about this mass which I was able to look at on screen, and asked if she could biopsy. She completed 5 core biopsies and inserted a clip, I was then asked to for another mammogram. Following this I booked an appointment which is tomorrow and left with a leaflet re biopsy and a form to complete for next visit. Sorry for the long thread but as many have, are and will have similar tests, is all of the above normal practice?",

I had to make the appointment before I left, that was last Tuesday, they only give results Wednesday afternoons so it\u2019s been a lengthy wait but on saying that not compared to some. Not sure where you are on your journey but do hope all is going well!",
