      "Content": "Hi. I went yesterday to have a picc line fitted at the top of my arm , as my veins in hand are just rubbish. However they could not get a picc line in yesterday , after 3 trys on 3 different veins they gave up , They said my veins are huge at the top of my arm , but in each vein they tried every time the line got half way up my valves in the vein kept closing not allowing the line to go any further. Was not a nice experience , not painful painful more rather uncomfortable. So now ive got to have a goshong line fitted in my chest and am worried that i will have the same problem fitting this as the picc line , as anyone had a goshong line in the chest and how did it all go , not having a very good start and its all making me feel down now.",
