    "Content": "Hi ladies, I hope I am in the right thread. I feel a bit dazed as my diagnosis of ILC was confirmed earlier this week. I saw a surgeon privately as I am insured and he said that he'd operate in the BMI Clementine Churchill in harrow on the hill as this is where he generally performs his surgeries.  I wonder... is this a good idea? Everyone in the thread talks about the Royal Marsden. I feel I should get a second opinion on my scans. Any suggestions (I understand this has to be a pm) and what do you think... should I wait and see someone who works in a different hospital?  And help, thoughts and opinions would be much appreciated. My ability to think ia not at its best at the moment ",
