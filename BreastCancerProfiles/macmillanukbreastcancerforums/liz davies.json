    "Content": "I have just been diagnosed today.  Mastectomy definite on 24th possibly double, more tests on second breast on Friday.  Really feeling sick and shocked but know I have to have the treatment to be there for my kids in the future. Scary times ahead. Haven't even thought whether there will be other options - probably not - so head down - be brave and get on with it I think.... if only it were that easy.   Take care hun, Liz  ",
