I asked the receptionist at my doctor could possibly write me up for Femara as I've been having such awful side effects from the Cipla Letrozol. I wasnt holding out much hope as I was told it was too expensive! Going to change over to it tonight! :o) ",

I go back for a scan on the 5th of January so should know then. I was told nothing at my appointment except 'it's cancer'. Introduced to my breast care nurse and sent on my way. She was lovely and said to call her if I had questions but when I tried I just got the answering service which I can't talk to. I've felt pretty numb so far.... it still feels unreal. This group are brilliant for support and you can ask them anything!  Carol x",

I lost both parents to cancer, one lung and one bowel so obviously a bit nervous about having this thing in me. I live in Scotland by the way. I also had a Dexa scan which I arranged through my GP. I'm on 1500mg of Adcal twice a day, Fultium-D3 200's and Vit K as it showed g already had serious bone loss. They put me on Risedronate too but I only took it for two weeks as was concerned about the side effects.",

      "Content": "Hello Heather, sorry ive taken so long to reply.  Life seems to have gone a bit crazy just now. The side effects from the Letrozole have been giving me a lot of grief and trying to get them sorted out even harder. I guess it takes my mind off the bc tho! It sounds like you've really been through the mill with yours but hopefully out the other side and still keeping well. If I can get a make of Letrozole that gives me less side effects I will cope with continuing the treatment until im ready for surgery. One of the additional problems I've got is under active thyroid which I've had for over 25 years. Its never been very well controlled and I'm on Thyroxine for it... side effects joint and muscle pain and raises cholesterol.  The Letrozol causes cholesterol to rise too! I was put on statins to lower it but couldnt tolerate the extreme joint and muscle pain so had to give it up after 18 months. I can't give up Thyroxine, can't take Statins, can't stop Letrozol.....  all of ehich are driving me crazy!  As you'll know, the other side effects are awful too, I'm feeling like a dried up old prune. I've got an appointment at the hospital eye department as I've been getting double vision and horrendous dry eyes. I can no longer wear my contact lenses. I sound like I'm feeling sorry for my self but I just feel I could cope with the treatment if I could even minimise some of these problems!  It would be nice to stay in touch and I promise to try and not complain as much in future!  Regards, Carol x",

      "Content": "I found the lump at via end of Sept last year and by the time I was seen at the hospital it was the 3rd of Nov. I had biopsies done on three areas including lymph nodes that day and was diagnosed with bc on the 10th. I was seen again mm the 17th and put on Letrozole that day. I've had 3 hospital appointments since then, each with ultrasound examinations. My tumour measured 28mm on the 10th of Nov and each appointment since then they've said it's \"softening\". At my appointment last Wed I told them I'd had discomfort under my armpit and it was scanned too, I asked about surgery and was told I could be on the Letrozole for up to a year before its done! I just don't know if I'm happy to be sitting about with this alien thing in my body for that long! Help, info, anyone? ",

I also had my sentinel node and three others removed. So far I've not been in too much pain but I have had a weird dizzy/nausea thing for the last three days. No rise in temperature on my incisions or swelling. Anyone have any ideas on this as I don't go back to see the surgeon until Wednesday.  I'm also getting my results then so nervous in case I have to go back in for more surgery. Thanks Carol",

My tumour shrunk from 28mm down to 10mm. the surgeon thought that was a pretty good result and the time was right to get the little beggar out! I'm still on Femara and although I still have side effects...joint, muscle and bone pain, I'm managing to get on with life. It's seven days since my surgery so hope to be free of this woozy feeling soon!  Carol ",

      "Content": "Hi all, I had my third hospital appointment yesterday and now know what's what. My breast cancer is ER+ 2. I saw the surgeon and he put me on Letrozole to try to shrink the tumour before surgery. So six weeks on it then ultrasound to check the size again. If it looks like it's got smaller... another six weeks on it then surgery.  If not surgery right away. He wouldn't discuss type of surgery until he knew what he was dealing with!  Only real question I've got is in the booklet they gave me about the drug, it says I will be given a bone density scan before treatment then again at the end to check for thinning. I wasn't.  They said I'd be given one at the end.... how can they compare if they don't have a pre treatment scan? Probably nothing in the grand scheme of things!  Carol ",
