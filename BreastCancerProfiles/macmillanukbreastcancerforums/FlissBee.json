      "Content": "SaxxyD is right that nails will recover...only problem is whether you want to wait!! nails grow quite slowly so it can be best to stop the problems earlier on.Â  There's been quite a lot of talk about the best products to use recently in the forum - here's my quick summary Onicolife drops - from www.mosaiclife.co.uk (they also do a good fact sheet on nail care during chemo) - good for yellowing and brittleness and sore nails evonail - online from farmaline - comes from Europe I think, but quite quick to arrive emu oil - can get on amazon paint with dark nail varnish - sometimes can help with photosensitivity, but seems mixed views on this ...and last thing, you mention numbness. docetaxel can also cause peripheral neuropathy so I think it is well worth telling your onc or nurse about these symptoms.
