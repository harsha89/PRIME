      "Content": "Just like to ask if anyone else has really struggled with chemo hair loss? I lost my hair in October 2017, and finished chemo in January 2018. My hair is growing back now but Ive got to stage where Im going to have to ditch the wig (its becoming too hot to wear it) but I really need to find some confidence from somewhere to go into work with this new short chemo crop! Any tips/advice please?",
