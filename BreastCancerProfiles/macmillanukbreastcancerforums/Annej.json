      "Content": "Hi Caitlin I'm only just going back to work, one year on, but my Job is very hands on so unable to do it from home. Working from home shouldn't be a problem. My late husband managed to continue working through his cancer.Â  I did feel if he had done it then I should have been able to work. But he didn't have chemo and radiotherapy. On a lighter note chemo brain, make list if you can remember what to put on them and don't try to start the car with the front door keys and open the door with the car keys.",

      "Content": "Hi I brought 2 bra's from Amazon. They are front fastening and the sizing is small medium etc. They are made by Amoena the one's I have is called the Frances non wire front closure bra. They are soft enough to be worn at night. Due to the position of the of my surgery I found that crop top bra's would ride up and dig in. My scars are under both breasts. I still occasionally wear them as sometimes my breast get sore. My surgery was almost a year ago. The only downside is you can't wear low cut top's. But at that time I was more interested in comfort then fashion.",
