    "Content": "You have expressed a \"flare-up\" in your leg.  I get them too.  They are painful as I have experienced the muscle spasms in my breast too.  I went to my Oncologist and expressed my concerns.  They were very rude to me,  said it was all in my head and treated me with no respect or dignity or compassion of any kind.  They don't know is the problem so they turn it around on the patient.   I had DCIS , surgery and radiation.  The Surgeon said I didn't have enough radiation to cause muscle spams.  I have also experienced neuropathy  and the tingling in my legs and the needles I feel under my feet are debilitating.   I feel the radiation caused this problem.  However,  the Oncologist again made me feel as though I made it up.  A CT scan was ordered from another Oncologist because they didn't know what to do with me.  I was not impressed and these spasms are real and many women are suffering.  I was put on muscle spasms and a anxiety med.  I was told by my Primary Care that Botox injections are used.  The one Oncologist I saw suggested a mastectomy to cure the problem.   I personally feel these breast spasms need to be understood.  They are not and because Oncologist are not up to date they will turn it around on the patient.  I am seeing a Neurologist and will address these issues.  I can't even walk the pain is so bad and its not diabetic related. I had blood work.  I blame my leg's and breast spasms on radiation.  I know my body and its still a science with cancer.   I will write back in after I see the  Neurologist and let you know.  We still need to report these issues to the cancer society,  whoever cares to listen.  It was bad enough going through cancer, but worse when the Oncologist refuses to believe these are real in women.  They are not God's and mine act like it.  I have a few months to go till my 5 year mark.  Due to the horrible experience, surgeon telling me the cancer I had meant nothing,  called me fat,  I was a liar about the spams, I refuse to go back. ",
