      "Content": "Hello As you say there is so much to learn. I've noticed a lot of people have been talking about side effects but please try to remember that everyone is different, and will react differently to chemo. Not to mention the fact that we're all having different regimes. The only universal reaction seems to be the feelings of nausea - and these can be controlled by taking the antisickness medication regularly without waiting for sickness to kick in. I am going to have my 5th chemo this week - at no point have I had headaches nor have I lost my sense of taste. I had mouth ulcers for a couple of days, and I've had joint pains and tiredness. What I want to say is you won't know what side effects your friend will experience until she actually has the chemo. We all worry about it beforehand, but it may well not be half as bad as you're expecting. Good luck and please let us know how she gets on. Very best wishes. Kate xxx",

      "Content": "Hello Dee Yes - I agree with Ruth - please get it checked out ASAP. Just FYI - at several points in my life, I have been sent to work abroad, recruiting and training staff for my Firm's new offices. Every time, without fail, I have had either styes or small cysts on either the top or bottom eyelid, and I was told these were caused by stress - and heaven knows, we all have enough of that !! Please do mention yours either to the pharmacist or the cancer clinic - it may be nothing, but at least they will be able to give you something to make you feel better. Love, Kate xxx",
