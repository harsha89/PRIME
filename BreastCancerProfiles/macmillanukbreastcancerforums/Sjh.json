      "Content": "Thanks for your reply Maree I went to my GP who prescribed me Gynest. Have been using it for a couple of weeks now, and with success!! She did warn though that it cannot be used for more than a couple of months at a time, due to small increase of womb cancer risk. Honestly, I sometimes think you can't win! My cancer was a grade 3 triple negative, so could not be treated with tamoxifen, just chemo and radio. Unfortunately, 10 months down the line, I have found another lump in the same place, so have to go back to hospital next Thurs to get it checked out. Hopefully it's just scar tissue, but best to make sure. Best wishes to you Sarah",

      "Content": "Hi there, I'm a new member and would really welcome any advice as I'm feeling really worried. I was diagnosed with triple negative in march this year, had a lumpectomy, SLNB, 6xFEC chemo and radiotherapy. All my treatment finished in October, and my partner and I are trying to get our lives back on track. The chemo has put me into menopause, and the hot flushes are coming thick and fast. However, upon trying to have intercourse I found it impossible, as the pain was incredible. It stung like crazy and felt like razor blades. Sorry to be so graphic, but is it just me? my GP prescribed me some sylk water based lubricant, but it hasn't helped. Has anyone else experienced anything like this? will I ever feel normal again!!!?",
