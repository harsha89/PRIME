      "Content": "Hey Catflower When we first find a lump we imagine everything. Any ache can become a pain. I now have secondaries in my spine a few years after my original breast cancer diagnosis,AND I have yet to have a single pain or ache. Long may that continue. The biopsies for me were the worst part of all my treatment and left me with more aches than anything else. Fingers crossed you will be OK and not only the lump will be nothing but so will all those aches. Take care  Xxx",
