    "Content": "hi, i had my lumpectomy in dec and i was left with quite an obvious indentation where the tissue had been removed. however, over the months this seems to have filled out with fluid and now is hardly noticeable. in fact, the only way you can tell any difference in the area is the discolouration in the skin from radiotherapy. personally i'm not too bothered about it as i see it as a kind of 'war wound' but if it's annoying you then speak to your breast care nurse/surgeon. hope radiotherapy goes ok. x",
