    "Content": "Hi I had surgery last May, and completed radiotherapy in Sept last year. I feel very well, but am still getting niggling sensations in my breast - it is not quite pain but I am aware of it. My surgeon saw me in Jan of this year, and says all is fine, but I am not sure. Has anyone else experienced this?",
