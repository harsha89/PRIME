    "Content": "Bedford69 Hi Ronstar i was originally due to have right beast mastectomy but combination of large breasts (52H) meant problems with balance and heavy prosthesi and reconstruction was not an option also given my family history of breast cancer and the fact it was triple negative it was agreed to have a double mastectomy- and I love it!!!!! 3 weeks after op I hit the swimming pool and began a new health regim as part of the new me and I now swim 4-6 days a week and feel great!!!  I love that I can fit in any clothes and don't have gaping buttonholes lol Mine was a 7 1/2 operation but I was up and about the next morning right as rain and apart from a bit of fluid retention when one of the drains had to be removed as it was starting to come out it was plain sailing.  Wouldnt want reconstruction as its not going to be my boobs back with the same feeling so not interested. love the freedom I feel now. Only thing is I can see my belly now!!! Lots of work to do now to rid that too...lol goid luck in whatever choice you make xx I feel so much better for reading yr story Bedford69. I had left side mastectomy with immediate reconstruction using expander in Aug 15. I had asked for double mastectomy and was told it wasn't possible, since I gave a problem with symmetry I opted for the reconstruction which was a massive mistake. First the expander kept deflating when I eventually had expander replaced with implants in March together with uplift of rite boob I was great for 7 wks then my perfectly healed scars on both boobs began to split open and I had a constant escape of fluid on mastectomy side! No matter what my consultant did the scars would not healing.  I had 4 procedures over a 6 wk period.  Eventually I had to have implant took out and replaced with expander. The idea being to leave it flat let my v thin skin heal then begin to inflate it. Sadly this didn't work I continued with same problem until eventually I had a hole the size of a tennis ball and the expander fell out! My consultant operated leaving the loose skin with intention of fat harvesting to build a boob! Again the scar healed perfectly then again I started with the same problem  I now have two holes in my chest with a 5cm cavity which has to be packed and dressed every other day! Had I been able to have a double mastectomy in the beginning I wudnt of gone thru all this pain and suffering.  I've been pleading for them to remove my other boob I don't want any more reconstruction but they still reluctant.  I have been referred to a plastic surgeon who has said she will support me on my fight to get another mastectomy!  Finally someone is listening!  I'm not doing this lightly or because I'm afraid of cancer returning I'm doing it to be equal. I cannot bear the tght of wearing a prosthetic 24/7 I wud be far happier having nothing and wearing nothing for everyday life just having a set of prosthetics to wear for special occasions which I can then put away in a drawer till the nxt special occasion!  Reading replies on here has made me more determined to fight harder to get what I want not what they think I should have. It's great and positive to hear that yr happy and have moved forward with yr life minus boobs! ",
