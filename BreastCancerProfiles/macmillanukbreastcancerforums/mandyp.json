      "Content": "It's 3 weeks since my law chemo, some of my toenails ate really sore (or the skin below/surrounding them). Was going to redo toe polish and they look disgusting.  My big toenails have gone dark brown and really thick. I'm not sure if there's anything I can do about the discomfort/if it's normal or not. I won't be at Oncology for a while and Radiotherapy starts on Wednesday.  I'm unsure if it's chemo related (pacletaxo) or I have a fungul nail that will need treatment. Thanks",

      "Content": "I've sort of cut my nails after soaking and have a 90 minute foot mask on as I type, having pumiced my feet. I was out last night and couldn't wear any 'going out' shoes or boots as it was too uncomfortable. It does look like one of them is coming away a bit. I've been moisturising my feet as the nurse said that was the only thing I could do to protect my toenails.  I won't put any more polish on, even though it's how I've been trying to hide it.  Didn't realise radiotherapy could also affect nails.  Thanks for the replies",

      "Content": "I had my second of 9 weekly pacletaxol yesterday. Got curious and wondered what the blood results meant in my chemo book. I notice that 'neuts' are a lot lower since I first had fec chemo back in April. I'm desperate to get chemo over and with all the delays due to recurrent uti's I don't want that happening again. Neuts are down to 1.8. I did a wee search about and found that apparently Manuka honey will increase neuts. Has anyone tried this/found it worthwhile? Also, due to delays/surgery I'm now sporting a fairly  thick (albeit short) white head of hair. The colour is horrific however I'm pleased with the regrowth (btw I used Nioxin shampoo etc and would recommend it). I've been told my hair may go and it will go by 2 different oncologists. Sounds silly but even hanging on to this bit of hair would feel like a small victory. Thanks once again in advance for any help",

That said I wish my beard and moustache would go and they've not either! Also still have a little bit of leg hair growth and some hair on my head!  Unsure if it would be ok to wax tache as i normally would Congrats to all the ladies and any kind of victory!",
