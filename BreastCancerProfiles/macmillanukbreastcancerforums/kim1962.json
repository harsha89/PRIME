      "Content": "Hi all, i was diagnosed at mamagramme on 16th June , had bone scan the next day and c.t scan on the monday. I  had masectomy on 1st July, am still in shock really. I go back to hospital on 18th July to see what further treatments i need, have been told i will need tamoxifen and radiotherapy for starters.I also  have Lupus which may effect my treatment options. Is anyone else at the same stage so we can compare treatments and share advice, I am worried about the amount of numbness i feel all down the effected side and parts of my back, is this normal? thank you anyone who replies",

      "Content": "Hi Tessa thanks for replying, i am glad your lupus improved after treatment, I have had lupus and lupus nephritus for 14 years and was doing well on 5mg prednisalone and 150mg azathioprine with no real lupus symptoms. I am a little worried however as reading other comments on chemo, that steroids have to be taken as well. do you know what dose is given as i already have thinning bones from the steroids and dont fancy putting on more weight as steroids tend to do? thanks KIm",
