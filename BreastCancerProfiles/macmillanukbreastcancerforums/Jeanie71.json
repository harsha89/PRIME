      "Content": "Hi. I'm 48, I was diagnosed with BC on 14th March but (due to test results coming in a day after that weeks MDT meeting) only found out the type and grade today. I'm feeling so overwhelmed, confused and (in a way) angry. I have a 15mm Grade 3 Triple Negative Right Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (how can something so small be invading my body?). I met with my surgeon today and I have a treatment plan, that helps me get my head around what's happening (I felt in limbo before knowing). Surgery is booked for 11th April where I will have a wire guided wide local excision and SNB. Surgery will then be followed by both chemo and radio therapy. I'm concentrating so much on being positive for my family (especially my 11yr old daughter) I'm exhausted already. I am positive for the final outcome but it doesn't mean I'm not scared of the journey to get there - I just don't feel I can let my family know my true feelings x",

      "Content": "Hi Haysie I've read your blog. I am sorry to see you are facing this battle a 2nd time. I'm sort of finding it easier to cope by concentrating on the permanent exterior bravado, just waiting for when I will break - I've not really had a meltdown/hissy fit so far! To start with, I was given the choice of chemo or lumpectomy 1st, but then my surgeon suggested that, as the lump is less than 20mm in size, to have lumpectomy then chemo. I hope your kids are able to hold onto the fact you 'kicked ass' the 1st time when you tell them of this new fight. If I can figure out how to/if it's possible, I will add you to my friends list if that's ok! Kick Ass. My thoughts are with you. Keep in touch with me also! Jeanette x",

      "Content": "Thank you for your response Gail. I'm sorry for you being on a similar path, it sure is scary! I've managed to openÂ up to my husband - we both found ourselves awake at 3am, and turned to each other for support. He doesn't want me to hold back my feelings from him - he says he's with me 100% of the way (I surely do feel blessed to have him). With regards to my daughter, she knows about the BC and that there is a treatment plan, reassuring her she can ask me anything as and when she feels ready and luckily she also has two older brothers (24 and 22) to turn to. Her school is also aware and keeping an eye out for her. Holding you in my thoughts. Jeanette xXx",
