It's a very safe procedure nowadays, but ask about any concerns on Monday.  You'll probably be asked to keep an eye out for any signs of an allergic reaction (e.g. a rash). I don't much like the sight of blood going into me myself, but just try not to look at the bag...  Think I remember someone covering the bag up, which you could try if you really don't like the sight of the stuff.  If it helps, blood is quite a distinctive red colour - definitely looks quite different from Daunorubicin, though don't know about epirubicin.",

The effect on fertility is something that it's quite reasonable to consider when deciding what treatment to have (I don't have any kids, and the possibility of my being fertile after chemo was one reason why the treatment I've had was recommended over more intensive treatment).  It's very reasonable to have questions, though - I hope you can get the treatment that's right for you.",

This is a small risk - so I wouldn't panic if you've been drinking bottled water.

Personally, I'd go for tap water as it's cheaper!  I know some people prefer bottled though.

Debates about using mammograms in screening don't really relate to the way a mammogram was used in your diagnosis.  No-one sensible is saying that mammograms shouldn't be used as a diagnostic tool when there are symptoms or a lump is found (as in your case).  What is uncertain is whether or not using them to screen all women in certain age groups is useful.",

The problem is that - when deciding whether or not to choose screening - people don't know which group they will fall into.  This means that it's important for the risks and benefits of screening to be communicated well to women who are deciding whether to get screened - I'm not convinced this happens in the NHS at the moment.",

E.g. if fewer women are diagnosed with cancer through screening (younger women are less likely to get cancer) but 10% of women don't have cancer are still called for additional testing, there will be more false positives for every accurate diagnosis. - If you screen older women, this is likely to lead to treatment of increasing numbers of women who wouldn't have become ill with or been killed by their cancer even if it had never been found. Although people are living longer we all die of something eventually, so a slow-growing cancer found when someone is 75 is a lot less likely to need treatment in their lifetime than one found when they're 40.",
