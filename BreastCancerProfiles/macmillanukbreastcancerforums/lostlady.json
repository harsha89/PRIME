    "Content": "Hi there,I would like some information on IVF if possible,Im still having periods although on tamoxifen for two years,also had injections in my tummy which was apparently to protect my eggs? I am quite confused wether I still can or not? Is there such a place for people like me? I had my fallopian tubes removed ten years ago,as was in danger of eptopic every month,hence will I recieve any help now Im hopfully in remmission pending results 12th march,do they still treat people who have had cancer? & does this cost or can I have help for something good in my life to look forward to? please please help me? id so long to walk out of a hospital with my partner smiling with great news!! my three year journey has strained or relationship,but lt also made us so much stronger,really hope anyone can help me??
