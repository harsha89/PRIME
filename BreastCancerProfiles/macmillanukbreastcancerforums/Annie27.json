      "Content": "I'm one year post mastectomy and 6 FEC finished in March. Diagnosed with ductal breast cancer, ER+, with lymph nodes clear. Finally got appointment to confirm reconstruction (going to have expander) but do I have the other breast removed? I've been told that the chances of it coming back in the other breast is the same as any other woman, due to type of cancer and the fact it hasn't spread, but it's still a 1 in 8 chance!. To me that's still high. My partner says \"do you really want to risk going through that again?\". They also say I will have annual mammograms for 5 years, but if there's no additional risk, why increase the frequency? I'm confused!",

      "Content": "Hi. Due to the euphoria of your wedding and honeymoon, I would think you may have a little further to fall, so to speak, but everyone reacts differently. Glad you had an amazing time and managed not to let the diagnosis sour it . I sound a bit like your wife - stoic, and just taking it in my stride. To me I just see it as a stage of life. Obviously none of us want this disease, but someone has to, so no point in feeling sorry for ourselves - well, that's I feel personally. My partner and I were devastated when I got the news (Grade 3, but not spread), but soon came round in a week, knowing that once we had a treatment plan, we could see a way forward. Although your wife's acting very strong, remember that she may be trying to hide her fears from you, but no doubt you've got a strong relationship, and talk things through, which is always a good thing. Sure they'll be times when you both get down, but it's been caught now, and she can be rid of it, and in say 6 to 12 months, the treatment will hopefully be over. I've had my mastectomy and now had 5 chemo sessions, so now looking forward to returning to some sort of normality (and work), although reconstruction still needed. Glad to hear you've got loads of support - it makes a real difference, and this site is brilliant! Best wishes x",

Shouldn't be too late to get it done. Only downsides are showering and the weekly trips to have it flushed/cleaned. We always had heats pads placed around arm for probably 10 mins to help the veins and assumed this was normal. Seems to be the best option for you, so may be a good idea to request this? x",

I've just had my 5th session, and my 3rd was the worse (so far!), with bad indigestion and backache (latter due to the GCSF injections). Fatigue and dizziness seems to be getting worse. Also suffered from fuzzy brain and dry eyes, so your symptoms seem to be quite normal, so as long as you haven't got a temperature, shouldn't be anything to worry about. Well done on your walk - I don't even manage that a lot of the time! x",

You have to accept that you can't physically be the person you used to be. You have to accept that YOU come first. I used to do the same - think I'm doing OK, then do too much, and end up trembling and dizzy. It's early days for you.Â  I've had 4 chemo's, so have learnt to pace myself, and learn from my mistakes. I also seem to eat a lot, mainly because of my furry mouth (yuk!). I do a bit of Yoga at home, but take it very easy as both my arms are achey and weak, but gentle exercise is all most of us can or want to do. Nothing wrong with a weep, but don't let it get the better of you. Keep positive, and you'll come out the other end. People always say REST is the key to recover - don't over do it, and accept you can't do what you used to do. You'll be back walking your dogs soon, but in the meantime look after YOURSELF, and if you can get someone else to walk them, it may be best x",

They come with wider and softer straps for comfort, pockets in both cups for prosthesis, and they're obviously higher at the front to hide the lack of cleavage. I didn't wear one for weeks after MX as it didn't feel comfortable, and was worried about the scar healing, but it's different for everyone. I chose a bra that was slightly bigger i.e. 36 not 34, so when wearing one, I could tighten it if I wanted to, but kept it a bit loser most of the time. I won't be switching to normal bras until I have my reconstruction. You should be able to see your BC Nurse to discuss this, and they can give you some good advice. Best regards, xx",
