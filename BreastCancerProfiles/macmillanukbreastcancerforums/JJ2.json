    "Content": "Hi Linda, I too ended up in hospital after every FEC chemo treatment. I also had the gent injections to boost my marrow as my counts dropped from as early as day 4 after treatment. I think we are both too sensitive. I didn't have my last FEC as was told it was to dangerous. This was discussed at length with my oncology team. But as I was moving onto herceptin they didn't see it as too much of a problem. I followed all the guidelines to the letter, resting, eating and being on lock down and no visitors during days 10- 14. It was on day 14 of my first treatment that I was neutropenic. After that it was day 5, day 4 and day 6 twice after treatment. I don't think anything I or Dr could of done would of prevented my admission to hospital. Just too sensitive to the chemicals. Your oncology team may want to reduce the strength of the chemo to prevent admission but they will discuss this with you. I was told about Manuka honey said to help boost the immune system. Nice honey can't say it worked for me. Unfortunately it's just something that i/we have to endure. It's never nice hospital stays but the safest place to be. Hope the rest of your treatment goes well.",
