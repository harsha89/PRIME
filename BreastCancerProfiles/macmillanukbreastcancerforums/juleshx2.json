    "Content": "Hi, I was diagnosed with DCIS high grade cells. Had a wired excision in November 08 but histology revealed extensive disease so advised to have Mastectomy. I had a skin sparing mastectomy with a DIEP reconstruction on 13th January 09 at Broomfield Hospital in Chelmsford Essex. I am now 7 weeks post op. I have no nipple at the moment as this is reconstructed at a later date but it does not look as bad as you might think. I decided that i wanted to get all the surgery done in one go as i am a nurse and was not keen on being a patient too often. I was in theatre for 7 hours and an inpatient for 7 days. Surprisingly i was not in very much pain. The worse part for me was lying in bed flat on my back for 3 days and not getting any sleep. My essential list of equipment to take into hospital would be a mobile phone, an ipod (if you like music), Some cartons of juice with straws and a spray bottle that you can fill with water or a fan! I got extremely hot. The results of my surgery are amazing, far exceeding my expectations. The post op recovery has gone well but is very frustrating. Be prepared to be patient and dont be afraid to take up all those offers of practical help from friends. Good luck on whatever course you choose to take. I have found the breast care nurses to be invaluable. Take care, jules x",
