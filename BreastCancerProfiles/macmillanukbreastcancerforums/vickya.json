      "Content": "KateG, What side effects did you have, if any, from the Tamoxifen?  I was on it and had periods, some very bad, some lasted a few weeks and then maybe not so I never knew when I was safe. Also very tired most of the time although do try and swim/gym/walk dogs to keep active as am also arthritic and was also struggling with weight.  I was changed to  anastrozole (Arimidex®), after 18 months and the removal of polyps and D&C didn't stop the periods but now still getting them and all other symptoms on the new drugs.   I'm seeing hte consultant again and asking if I can just stop taking them as my chances only improve 5% with them.  DId they give you choices with percentages of treatments? ",
