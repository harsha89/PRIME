      "Content": "Hi summer holiday, I\u2019m on week 9 of weekLy Taxol, now aiming for 12 as it\u2019s working. Steroids - l only now have the steroids via IV on chemo day, l stopped taking the 4 x 2mg on Sat and Sun as l found steroids made me feel worse, made me very emotional, like hysterical crying, spoke to onc and he said drop them, and lm much better.  I\u2019ve been fine without, lm much better on Taxol, l was pretty ill on the dreaded EC, but lots of women ate fine.

      "Content": "Hi JammyR, I think everyone is so different, l had a terrible time on EC,neutropenic and infection on first one, hospital for 5 days very ill, neutrophils were 0.002 - non existent practically, with temp of 39.9 at one point, very scary times.  for the other 3 sessions, l had to spend 10 days in bed afterwards. Now on 3rd Paclitaxel ( out of 12 ) and so far thankfully  l have had very few side effects,no days in bed, as l was dreading it too, just a bit of sore mouth and quite tired, but nothing like EC.  After being horizontal for weeks on end, this is so much better, l have come off Dex steroids too as just made me cry all the time. Plus my hair has started growing again after 3rd EC (ironically when l stopped using the cold cap). Everyone reacts differently so l hope it goes well for you too. Good luck",

      "Content": "JammyR, You were awake early! It was a very scary time as they couldn\u2019t get my temp down, but they did an excellent job, and it seems adding Asprin to the paracetamol did the trick in the end.  Good old Asprin eh. It was over Christmas so l met loads of the lovely nurses as they were doing like 4 hour shifts. And l see them when l go for my chemo now which is nice.  You were in hospital on first cycle too, that\u2019s not nice,  l maybe should have gone in earlier but being first cycle l guess l thought feeling unwell was normal. I would think you should be fine now you are on day 12, l used to be okay after day 10 (they did reduce my dose after 1st one) then they removed the C for 3rd and 4th and lump shrunk loads still.  I read lots about women having problems with Taxol too, so was very apprehensive and can\u2019t quite believe I\u2019m ok (touch wood so far) l know it can change of course. Lots of luck Nikki ",
