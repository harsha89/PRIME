      "Content": "Hi dear Mandz, I had much the same and am inclined to get red irritable skin on my face when I am stressed. Before my op I went running a lot which really helped the stress levels. I was stupid and overdid it straining my achilles though :( !! So don't go crazy, but something which makes you feel you are satisfying the fight/flight may well make you feel better. Be nice to yourself, this is a time to indulge both mind and body. And I promise nothing will be half as bad as you are imagining.  thinking of you",

      "Content": "Hi Charlene, thank you for asking questions I too would like the answers! I have been recommended Endocrine manipulation with Tamoxifen but have not actually been given the prescription yet, maybe I will get it after Radiotherapy. I had highest score, 8 for positive oestrogen receptor. However I am 58 and have not had a period for several years so I am confused why I am being prescribed Tamoxifen rather than an Aromatase inhibitor such as Letrozole. I had been on HRT before my diagnosis. Now I'm off it I can remember why I went on it!! Hot flushes, anxiety, sleeplessness, muscle craps, aching joints.  I wonder if different Endocrine manipulation drugs effect people differently? Is it possible to switch till you find one with the least side effects? Is there a way of measuring your Oestrogen levels, seems ludicrous to take a drug unless you definitely need it? Keep us posted on what you find out and good luck :)",

      "Content": "Hi Charlene, thank you for getting this thread started, it has been really helpful to get all the feed back from so many kind souls and I've learnt a bit from it. Let us know how you get on. Sounds like a bit of a minefield but at least there is the option to try different pills to see which works best for you. Does anyone know if a hormone test is informative, my Oncologist seemed to think not? I would like to know if a drug I take is having the desired effect. If it is, it is easier to tolerate the side effects!",
