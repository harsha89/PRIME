      "Content": "Hi I am new to the forum, just wanted to make new friends along this nightmare of a journey and to seek some of your knowledges and personal experiences. I am 51yearsof age, despite having two knee replacements I am fairly, active. I teach part time, walk my dogs 1-2miles every day longer at weekends, visit the gym twice a week and generally have never been fitter. Last month I was diagnosed with multi site high grade DCIS, clear SLN (thankfully) and I will now be having a mastectomy, immediate LD flap and implant reconstruction on the 11th Jan and I am dreading it. It took me some time to reach this decision about the LD flap as opposed to an implant, but the consultant did think this was my best option and his results i have to admit do look very good. If you have been through this experience would you please mind sharing your experiences good and bad. The questions that are going through my mind are..... Drains how many ....urinary catheter as well? What is the pain and discomfort levels like initially? Is the back wound very painful? Sleeping positions.? I am happy to do physio religiously, good record with my knees. As i cannot kneel, i use my upper body and legs to get up off the floor, and to get out of the bath, long term am i going to be able to do this? All experiences appreciated. Xxx",
