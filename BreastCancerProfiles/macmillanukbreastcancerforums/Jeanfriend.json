      "Content": "Hi Mudge Kung Hei Fat Choy to everyone. Blue Peugot 208. My further thoughts about chemo are I couldn't have done it without my fantastic partner,don't suffer in silence-if the anti sickness isn't working tell them immediately, be open with your loved ones. I was advised not to go into crowded situation but not to give up the stuff I enjoyed, so I continued to go to the theatre and pictures. If we ate out we were told to go early and to avoid food that may be high in bacteria content, no takeaways. I was very good but got a water infection after the third round which meant I had to stay in hospital. I had a fear of hospitals from childhood experiences but they were fantastic at the fabulous Christie in Manchester. Although I was wiped out some of the time I was still able to go on long bike rides on the good days-upto 20miles. I have been very lucky-a statement my partner thinks is crazy but they caught it early, I have had fabulous treatment it has brought us closer together and I have got a new slant on life. Best wishes for Tuesday and let us know how you go on. By the way I have written a blog and if you google lankielass.blogspot.com you can read the whole story. Jean Xxx",

      "Content": "Hello Mudge, I didn't quite have the same as you. Grade 3 tumour with no lymph node involvement. Chemotherapy had not been suggested initially but when it turned out to be a grade 3 tumour the surgeon said that I might want to consider chemotherapy. I would have liked them to make the decision for me. My partner and I did a lot of research and we asked as many people as possible about their experiences and I also spoke to my GP who said that if his wife was in that situation he would not hesitate to say have it. They said I would have FEC-T and on my next visit to the hospital the doctor listened to my chest and said \"do you know that you have a heart murmur?\" So I had to have an echocardiogram and in the end the FEC-T was changed to TC because the E in FEC can effect the heart. The first dose of TC was on the hottest day last summer and I had a bad headache for several days that week. It wasn't a fun week. I had the immune system boosting injections for 7 days after the chemo which were administered by the district nurses. They were absolutely fabulous and sorted out any problems that arose. The next 3 cycles were easier but I was very tired. On seeing the specialist before the fourth I told him how tired I was and he said they would therefore stop at 4. I can't say I was sorry BUT I have no regrets about having the chemo. I got my partner to cut my short hair shorter and spent some weeks bald. I didn't bother with a wig but bought lots of caps and when my hair grew back it was much thicker. I was fatigued for quite a while but have done all the exercises and made sure that I get as much exercise as possible. I am feeling very good now and today went and bought I new car. I am glad that I had the chemo. I wanted to give myself as much chance of surviving as possible. So I hope you can make an informed choice. Best wishes J",

      "Content": "Today I was discharged from the wonderful Christie centre in Manchester. My cancer was very similar to yours but I guess I am a bit older than you. I had to decide whether to have chemotherapy as it was a fast growing tumour that had not spread. I had some experience of watching someone go through chemo some years ago and didn't fancy it, but I wanted to live and decided to go ahead with the FEC-T. Only problem was that they discovered that I had a heart murmur so I had to have TC instead. Although the chemo was not fun I got through it a lot easier than I thought I would. I developed an infection around the fourth cycle and had to spend 6 days in hospital. I have had a fear of hospitals since my teenage years so all this has been a real test of my strength. I have discovered depths that I didn't know I had. I am blessed with a wonderful partner, who I love more than ever. We talked and joked about it right from the start, which helped us both get through it. I am certainly a stronger, better person than I was before all this. I have wonderful friends who have helped me through by cooking for me and taking me to the hospital. Friendships have been enhanced by me letting people do things for me. I now live more in the moment-life is good. You will get through this. I wrote a blog to keep people informed and to help me keep a record of what has happened. Have a look at it if you want-lankielass.blogspot. My best wishes to you and your family.",

      "Content": "Hi Mudge That's one thing I haven't had. I do have eczema and have used E45 and aqueous cream over the years. When it was really bad I was using the aqueous cream as soap. I now just avoid anything perfumed and keep away from biological washing powders. I had meant to say to you last time that my hair (on my head) has grown back much thicker and I am sure it's not as grey as it was. So I am dead chuffed. Hope it clears up for you very soon.

      "Content": "Hi again Mudge Paint your finger and toe nails with very dark polish. Drink lots of water. As I said before don't put up with any sickness and if any of the anti sickness drugs don't agree with you get them changed. I had the immune boosting injections for seven days after the chemo. These were administered by the district nurses. They were great support and source of information. Do not be tempted to take laxatives to soon. If you think you might need them go for the most gentle approach possible. As I started mine on the hottest day of the year I found myself very hot and didn't know whether it was the weather or the treatment. After using ice in plastic bags for the first lot of chemo I ordered a lot of cool bags of different styles and sizes from Amazon. A friend also lent me a big fan which was great. I found reading, watching the tele difficult so the cheap DAB radio was great for the times I couldn't do much. When I was upto reading and watching the box I found my small iPad fab as I could download programmes to watch later, download films and read the iPad versions of the photographic mags that I subscribed to. The TC did mess with my sense of taste and I found that I was using more salt on my food and that I had a craving for vanilla slices- a great excuse. I had bought different cordials to help me keep my fluid levels up and milkshake mix. However I found that I could drink milk drinks but the cordials were fine. I did develop a sour mouth on the first cycle. I do however haver lichen planus anyway in my mouth so it was not unexpected. Pineapple ice lollies help but the nurses had the problem sorted in 24 hours. Don't be frightened of asking the breast care nurse, the GP, the hotline, any of them for advice. The best helps were my partner, who I could not have got through this without and my friends that cooked for both of us. I can't remember everything but I do know that I have got through this amazingly well and am a much better person. As I said before have a look at my blog lankielass.blogspot.com to get the bits I have forgotten. Best wishes, will be thinking of you. Jean xxxx",

It made me think of the time during chemo when I couldn't go to cafés but there I was having got there in my new car! Life is really great, so I hope you will soon be upto full strength and upto taking the dogs for long walks. Take care Jean xxx",
