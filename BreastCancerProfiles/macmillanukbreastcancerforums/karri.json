I am honest with him and he seems to manage it well even though he's only 23 now. Its about taking one step at a time, there is no magic cure to how you feel, sites like this will help as talking is helpful, talk to your mum like a friend she will be more worried than you think, about you and what she has to go through. This is hard for you all, hugs to you all xxx Karri",
