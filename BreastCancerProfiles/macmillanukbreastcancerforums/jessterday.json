      "Content": "Hi there, I have 3 children a 16 year old daughter  an 11 year old  boy he's autistic and I have a 3 year old daughter, I must admit my good days are few n far between,  My patience is really wearing thin, mainly due to the lack of help I'm getting,  a lot of  it is just frustration, Hubby is also Autistic, so my world can get pretty lonely, I started writing as I find it therapeutic only problem is I don't get any me time, to actually sit and relax or vent, I actually enjoy my hospital visits as it's the only time I get a break.  sorry for the rant, from the sounds of it you guys have pretty much nailed it and have loads of support which is great!  ....x",
