      "Content": "Hi Maree, I've just finished my first box of Tamoxifen (only 59 more to go!) and can report that my periods have gone bonkers - first of all I was late, and then I had another one 2 weeks after!  I'm not sure if the tabs are making me gain weight, as I had gained a lot anyway during chemo, and am having trouble motivating myself to do much exercise (skin still sore from radiotherapy, so can't start swimming again yet, and boob area too sore in general to anything that requires less gentle movements!) I have woken up a couple of times during the night due to being hot, but the weather has been a lot warmer this last month, so I can't be sure if that's the Tamoxifen or not!  One thing I have noticed is leg cramps every now and then when I wake up, which I saw listed as a side effect somewhere. I'm only 30 and know what you ean about wanting to live a normal life.  I don't think the Tamoxifen will impact too much on your everyday life, I suppose it's just like taking the pill, you just have to remember it.  It's a bit strange for me as I know that I'll not even be able to think about having kids for another 5 years now...I hadn't really thought about it before diagnosis, but since being told the treatment may have affected my fertility and I can't get pregnant whilst on Tamoxifen, it seems to be all I can think about!  How fickle humans are! Hope all goes ok for you, keep us posted on whether or not you decide to take the Tamoxifen or not :-)",

      "Content": "I've been on Tamoxifen since June and have had cramps in my calf, like the other lady says, when she stretches her legs in the morning!  The weird thing is, I used to suffer from this about 10 years ago, long before I had to start cancer treatment.  It used to be so painful I thought my legs were going to fall off, but went pretty quickly and then stopped for years.  I was on the pill at the time, so I'm guessing it's something to do with hormones maybe?  Seems to be a pretty common reaction to the Tamoxifen from looking at these posts.",

      "Content": "Sorry to hear of your mum's troubles.  I was diagnosed in September and have had FEC, a mastectomy, radio and am now on Herceptin and Tamoxifen too.  I have definitely noticed that I am not quite right and as you say, I am often fretful and moody.  I originally put this down to steroids at the start of my treatment as I found myself feeling really \u201cbuzzy\u201d but also weak and shaky, as well as having MAJOR mood swings, but I haven't had any steroids now since January and the mood part doesn't seem to be improving.  I was wondering if it was the Tamoxifen as this can cause menopusal symptoms (I am only 30, but I'm guessing your mum is nearer the natural age for the menopause to occur) and I was also on Zoladex during my chemo, which can also cause menopusal symptoms.  Basically, I think they pump us so full of all these different chemicals and treatments that it's hardly surprising when our bodies and minds go a bit bonkers!!!  I'm sorry if that's not much help, but it's what I've had to keep telling myself to convince myself that I'm not going mad!  It is a lot to deal with emotionally too, so maybe your mum would benefit from some sort of counselling?  I was dead against it, but have now seen the light and it is good to have someone to speak to who is totally unbiased and non-judgemental.  Good luck with it all, I hope things will improve for you and your mum.
