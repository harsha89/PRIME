    "Content": "I'm only 39 but was referred for investigation after finding a lump that the GP said was not an obvious cyst. I had an ultrasound which was inconclusive and a mammogram which didn't detect anything. Consultant requested a core biopsy which was done yesterday although he says he isn't really that concerned but needs biopsy results for definitive answer. I had a chat with the oncology nurse before  before going home  and she explained that everything points to it being a fibrodenoma but that on occasions it can still come back as cancer. I get my results on Thursday. I am trying not to panic as everything so far appears positive. Has anyone else gone through this and it has actually come back as cancer? ",
