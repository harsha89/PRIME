    "Content": "Hi eveyone, I was diagnosed November 2012, had chemo prior to a mastectomy, followed by radio therapy. Developed seroma very quickly after the surgery, which caused a bit of a problem with RT, but overcame that easily. However seroma a kept reappearing and I ended up having surgery in November to stitch everything down. All went well for a few weeks and then boom, the area below the scar filled up again, I had 350 mlls drained last Wednesday. I now squelch , oh joy, it also feels like it's filling up again. Has anyone had this experience? I would be grateful for any suggestions. Good luck to all of you, keep smiling, it will confuse everyone.",
