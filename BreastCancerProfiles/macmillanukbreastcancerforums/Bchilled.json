      "Content": "For the last 3 or 4 weeks I've had a painful hip - right over my hip bone, hurting when I put weight on that leg and made much worse by running (only for the bus, nothing too athletic!). It started a week after I started tamoxifen and a couple of months after finishing chemo, but I don't know whether it's linked to either or just random. I mentioned it to my gp last week, and he said if it wasn't any better after a couple more weeks I should get it scanned just in case, and he was obviously thinking in case of mets, which threw me, as I hadn't thought of that, just thought tamoxifen or yet another docetaxel gift (still losing fingernails.) don't suppose any of you lovely ladies had anything similar?",

      "Content": "When I had my lump removed in the summer, the sentinel node biopsy came back with 3/3 nodes cancerous. I'd gone in for my post surgery checkup expecting the all clear and suddenly was faced with chemo, more surgery and rads, plus the agonising wait for MRI/CT results to confirm it hadn't spread further. Just had my axillary clearance results - 10 more nodes removed, all clear. On the one hand, I guess the fewer nodes affected the better the prognosis, but on the other, I'm left feeling that the node clearance, which leaves me with a significant lifetime risk of lymphodema, wasn't actually necessary. I've always considered myself a real glass-half-full type, but some days it's really hard to focus on the bright side!",

      "Content": "Just accept you have no way of knowing how it will affect you! It's so random, the best thing you can do is resign yourself to the uncertainty. Report any sickness and they'll give you better meds next time. Some effects are cumulative, so make the most of days when you feel well at the beginning as there could be fewer of them towards the end. And at the end, don't focus too much on looking forward to the last treatment - I did, and then got really fed up the following couple of weeks when I was still going though the side effects. Best tip though - if you've been trying to justify getting an ipad or similar, this is a brilliant excuse! I downloaded tv and radio programmes, puzzles, games and things to read .",

      "Content": "I bet \"bewildered\" is just the tip of the emotion iceberg. Maybe it's the time of year, but I'm having a major wobble today. Finished my chemo last week and should be glad, but now all I can think about is the lymph node clearance (January), rads, and then tamoxifen - it seems to go on forever and with no guarantees. Like you I was total unsuspecting when I was diagnosed - I was 46, fit and healthy, no family history or other risk factors, no symptoms. Everyone thinks I'm coping well, but I'm angry and scared and lonely - I too don't want to worry my partner even more, I'm sure he's in denial about the fact that even all this treatment might not work. People think I'm a bit of a control freak, and suddenly all I can do is turn up at hospital and have them put stuff in me or take stuff out of me and there's nothing I can do to help myself. Sorry - I know I'm not helping, just feeling sorry for myself! You're still in the first phase of shock - be kinder to yourself! The next year will be a roller coaster. Once I started chemo I actually felt ok as it wasn't as grim as I'd feared. A week after the first dose I felt better than normal! I joked about gaining superpowers from the chemical enhancement. I think it's these times in between treatment which are worst, when all you can do is wait and worry. But I guess what we all find from going through this is we're stronger than we think. You'll pull through!",

The fortnight after the last dose was among the hardest time of the whole experience, because I just wanted to stop feeling rubbish, but I was at the lowest point physically.

      "Content": "Hi - hope you're recovering well from the op. The waiting for the path results was one of the worst bits for me, and I ended up having no real choice about having the kitchen sink flung at me. You need to have a really good conversation with the oncologist. They have a predictor tool that works out what the added benefit of each treatment is for your diagnosis, and if the cancer hasn't spread to your nodes, I think the benefit of chemo is minimal. I was like you, ok about losing my hair (and actually, some days on chemo being able to shower and go straight back to bed without all that tedious hair drying is as good as it gets), but there's a whole load more potential side effects, some of which could continue affecting you for years, if not ever. I'm not trying to scare you, just to say - make sure you inform yourself of all the risks so you can balance them against the benefits. I genuinely don't know what choice I would have made, now I've gone through chemo, if I had thought it would only increase my chances by 1or 2%. Haven't started rads yet, so can't comment on how that makes you feel. Good luck, and stay strong.",
