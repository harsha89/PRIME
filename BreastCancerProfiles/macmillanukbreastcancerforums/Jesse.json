    "Content": "Hi I have secondaries in my liver too. I am not suitable for resection and I am looking at Radio Frequency Ablation. I have given info to my oncologists and they are all for it if I am suitable. Have had an MRI and a bone scan today to make sure there is no cancer hiding and when I finish chemo (2 more to go) I will be referred. Check out this website http://www.rfablation.co.uk",
