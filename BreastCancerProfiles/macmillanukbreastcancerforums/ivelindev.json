I am currently on chemo, 4th cycle this Friday. Hate it but so far so good. I haven't had any nasty infections or have been feeling sick. ",

      "Content": "My oncologist told me that after my axilla clearance I might feel a funny feeling where the nodes were, I might feel pain in the muscle at the back if some of the nerves were damaged since at that spot there are lots of nerves and blood vessels but then it would gradually pass. And this would happen only IF any nerve was affected and she also said that this rarely happened. ",

Still have got hair but it is disturbing.  I cut my hair military style as it was quite long and did not want to see it fall off in strands.  Tomorrow is my second chemo. Dreading it! But the more I get through, the less it is left. Trying to be positive!   X",
