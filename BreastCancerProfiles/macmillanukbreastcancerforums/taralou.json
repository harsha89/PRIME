Had lymph node clearance and again results showed more again. Thus put me into chemo which I was not due to have originally. Think they do chemo to be sure if any minute bits might have got away!!! None of this is easy but great community on here for any problems, moans, groans etc.  Goid luck and take care xxx",

      "Content": "Dreamthief; AnnieH1; collies; Boobylou; ArgyMargy; oks; Hi All Just an update on my zoledronic acid infusion which I received on Monday. All went well as most people have said about 15 mins with a flush either side of it. More than anything I noticed the difference with no Picc line as had to have the dreaded cannula!!! On Tuesday I noticed the \u2018flu like symptoms\u2019 arrive. A couple of painkillers and all was OK. Had it again on Wednesday but soon went. The couple of things I have noticed was firstly, I was not firing on all cylinders if you know what I mean. Just concentration levels seemed to have dropped considerably. Have got to Saturday (today) and everything is ok. Secondly, and would like advice on (hence I have tagged you Dreamthief!!! Before the ZA treatment and since chemo and RT I have had pain in my arm going all the way down to my fingers. This was waking me up at night as the pain was so severe. My fingers were/are numb and tingly. I mentioned to the Oncologist and he just passed it off as common side effect. However, since the infusion of ZA on Monday my fingers have got worse. The pain and numbness is apparent every morning and eases slightly as the day goes on. I would be grateful for any advice if anyone else has experienced this? I will be speaking to my BCN on Monday as am starting to get a little concerned. The Macmillan website states: Increased pain Sometimes pain in the affected bone can become worse for a short time when you start taking zoledronic acid. If this happens, your doctor can prescribe painkillers for you until it wears off. Flu-like symptoms These include a high temperature, chills, and pain in your muscles or joints. Let your doctor know if these effects are troublesome. It may be helpful to take mild painkillers. Numbness or tingling around the mouth or in the fingers and toes. Funny thing is I got through chemo with nothing untoward,  just the ususal side effects and feel I managed the majority of it pretty well (no hospital visits etc!!). So this is quite puzzling!!  ",

I have had the surgery, over halfway through the chemo (just waiting to ring that bell) and then 3 weeks of rads. Like jacks77 can't wait for it to be over but, I suppose, we don't really know what this means until it IS over!! We are so comsumed with the inital diagnosis, appointments, scans, chemo etc etc we just want to see the end of it and think YIPPEE all done............but is it??? This is when the emotions go into overdrive I suppose. We all think how well we are doing but there is so much support around you which in a way protects you and I suppose you feel a bit on your own when it is all over. I tink your post is sooo important to all of us and make us sit back and think where we will be a  years time Well done Alison xxx",

I had 7 rounds of chemo and didn't feel sick at all as the sickness  tablets they give you are very good. I would also be concerned about what you read on the net as it is not always accurate. Also your Oncologist/Oncoolgy nurses might not approve as you need to eat the right foods for your energy levels, blood count, immune system etc. Please note this is only MY opinion and I'm not an expert and can only speak from experience.

Oh no..... the 3 lymph nodes 2 were infected so I had a complete lymph node removal followed by chemo, RT and now on Letrozole. I am sure they know what they are dealing with when they are offering chemo instead of another op, the chemo should get rid of any strays. I would also advise you try and take someone with you to your appointments so that what you miss they will remember. Hope all goes well for you on Wednesday and be sure to llt us know.

Like Jacmatholmad I had clearance on 20th Dec and waiting until the 8th to get results. My oncologist has already told me I will be starting chemo in the new year. I am assuming that whether the lymph nodes come back clear or not it is a precaution. I would like to ask anyone who has had a clearance. It has been a 10 days since op and all was well up until a couple of days ago and I now have swelling under the arm, under the scar. Is this normal? Is it just swelling from op or something else as in lympedema? Many thanks for taking the time to read this and good luck to EVERYONE in 2018, we will all get well!!",

I would also mention that I go to my appointments from work so I am deodrant and moisturised up and there have been no complaints!!! Very weird this information given (or not as the case maybe) as it maybe different trusts we are all attending but they are still using the same machine for our treatment!!! My theory is that some hospitals have maybe had complaints when someon has had a bad reaction to RT so they tell you everything to cover themselves. Just my thoughts. Yes, I am having 15 as well, so 2 down 13 to go!!! Can't wait for this to be finally over, I have REALLY had enough now and have days when I feel totally sorry for myself and wallow in it and have a good cry. I am still so very tired and this heat is just killing me. I have always loved the sun and always out in it. Now, I'm not in the least bit interested as is far too hot. I just sweat all the time (not very ladylike I know!!). I know we shouldn't go in it anyway but I'm not even tempted which is so unusual for me. Ah well that's my moan over with.

      "Content": "Hi Moomc , I think I am 2 days in front of you as I have my 3rd zap tomorrow. Like you when I had the first treatment didn\u2019t even know it had been done and the same with the second!! I also had the same problem at the planning appt as was so, so long my arms went from pins and needles, numbness and then hurting as no feeling left in them!! That was awful. Must say apart from that everything has been fine so far. XjulieX I was a little bit worried about the breathing especially for 20 seconds (odd smoker as well) but I surprised myself and just about managed it. You will be fine, I think I had to hold about 2/3 times during actual treatment. I would also like to mention that I had seen on here about swimming so asked the radiologist and she said yes it was fine to go just that it could cause irritation and to keep an eye on it if I did swim. As for cream they, very reluctantly, gave me a tube of something (sorry, can\u2019t remember the name) but was quite happy me using my usual unless I get any irritation. As others have mentioned different protocols for different trusts. Mine are very laid back!!! Not sure if that is good or bad but they make me feel welcome and relaxed.",

      "Content": "I was approached by my radiography hospital a few weeks ago as to whether I would be willing to take part in a trial for a new drug called Abemaciclib. My first reaction is 'YES' of course, anything that can help I'm willing to give it a go. The drug is being trialled for patients with early stage HR+ and HER2- breast cancer. The idea is you take it alongside either Letrozole, Tamoxifen etc. The reason for this is to see whether taking this decreases the proportion of relapses after surgery compared with adjuvant endocrine therapy alone. I thought this sounded great and said I would participate. Anyway, after much tooing and froing (I was on holiday as well) they are still asking me to take part but I think I have had a change of heart and feel really bad and guilty  about it. The reason being are the side effects are almost as bad as chemo and I just don't think I can go through all that again. I am just getting back to feeling 'normal' and am back at work and thinking I can't start going sick after all the time I've had off with surgery and chemo etc. Would love to know if anyone is on this or just your thoughts????",

This surprised me but when answering the health questions they did ask if treatment was finished.

Without knowing your circumstances fully you said you have previously worked? If so you can claim ESA for up to one year based on your NI contributions whether you have a partner working or not. If he is not working you need to tell them regardless of the self employed status and he can also go on the claim with you (as a carer??). I work at the jobcentre but NOT the benefits centre so I know a little. I hope his may help. If you would like to ask any questions then please do however, I recommend you call the ESA claim line asap and make your claim. This will not help your recovery until you get help.",

      "Content": "Hi Veronica14, I have been thinking about applying for this as well. The only thing I can say is to reiterate what others have said and to also add my own advice (for what it might be worth!!) I know that claimants on ESA this is what they can expect and the main thing from their assessments is: They are asked to travel a fair way - this tells the doctors how bad is this person if they can travel here was it by bus/train/car etc. They are nearly always upstairs - they watch claimants if they use the stairs or lift. They are normally kept waiting a long time - again they are watched to see how they handle the waiting ie sitting/standing etc When they eventually get in to see the doctor they say a lot of what they tell them is ignored so be aware you make your point quite forcefully if you need to. I think from the above you can see what they are looking ie if you cannot walk how did you manage to walk upstairs? And yes, this is true. Unfortunately, the 'fiddlers' of the system don\u2019t usually have a brain and have stated they can\u2019t walk more than 10 yards however they have been seen walking upstairs!!! And all other similar. I did say this was ESA but I\u2019m led to believe it would be similar for PIP. As you are genuine you don\u2019t have much to worry about just remember they are there to declare you fit, the onus is on you to prove otherwise. As with everything you will need to exaggerate your symptoms, sorry but it\u2019s true. Definitely take someone with you Wishing you the best of luck and please let us know how you get on.",

I responded previously about my experience with ESA and have spoken to many assessors about the rules and regs. I know it sounds harsh what they do but in my experience 50% of people claiming ESA ( I can't speak for PIP claimants) are not entitled to it and are quite proud to be climaing this benefit and know all the tricks to use at assessments. Then again, there are the 50% of people who are entitled to benefits and have to fight hard to get them sometimes as with  Dayityrose. So I do try to understand both sides of the coin so to speak.

No phone call so I called at 1pm and asked about my appointment, yes, machine all fixed come in at 2.50? No, my appointment is for 2.15, No come in for 2.50. OK I will. It is a 45-minute drive to the hospital so I am three quarter of the way there and I get a call to say, sorry we need to cancel your appointment!! I said that I had been told to come in and am nearly at the hospital, ok she said come in and we will see you. EXACTLY 5 mins later another call (same girl) said we must cancel as your team who are going to do your treatment are not in today??? I asked why I was not told this before and explained that I was just about at the hospital by now. Ok she said again come in and we will see you. Got there and waited a couple of minutes and a guy called me. Went in and took me to a 'quiet room' and he explained that as the machines had only just been fixed they had a backlog of people waiting since this morning (??) and would not be able to do my treatment today. He did apologise and went through all the excuses blah blah blah. Am now booked for tomorrow AGAIN!!! It\u2019s such a shame as up to now I could not fault the NHS for the care and treatment I have received but this leaves a bad taste as the second call the girl was obviously lying about the team not being there. I hate liars and it was a bad excuse because if that was the case I would have been told this morning. So will wait and see what tomorrow brings!!!!",

I am sure there are lots of you knitting, crocheting, sewing etc to keep the dreaded side effects at bay and help us cope day to day. I personally knit and have posted on here some of my knitting. Would be nice to see/hear what other people do. We could share pictures, hints and tips as well So I will start with a couple of things I have done in the last few days. This is my slouch hat that I finished on Friday night. Will be wearing it for the first time today!! This was on the needles saturday night ...... And finished saturday night.    A little headband/earwarmer for my granddaughter. I am now off to have my PICC line inserted ready for 2nd round of chemo tomorrow (!!!!!!):) Hope to see lots of pics when I come back!! Have a good day everyone  xx",

I'm thinking of taking them to my chemo when I go, I think it would be nice to leave them there for people to take who need them (thats if they will let me but I think they will). The idea is to do pairs and then let people decide if they want one or 2!! I knitted on straight needles but on the Knitted Knocker official site (yes american) they do ALL, straight, DPNS, magic loop, crochet etc. I downloaded the pattern and after a few rows was so, so easy. I have also used the recommendations on the pattern such as over stuffing the knocker and leaving a kind of drawstring so the person can re-arrange or remove stuffing untill comfortable. I am going to match this one and then have a go at DPNS on another pair and see if there is any difference!! Here's the link for the pattern I used: https://www.knittedknockers.org/make-a-knocker/ Ask me anything I really don't mind!!!! Take care",

I did hear (from where I don't know!!) someone said they had a knitted knocker and it looked like a false boob and din't like it?? I can't really understand that as they are stuffed so you can make comfortable adjustments to them.

The pictures of everyone's arts and crafts are all AMAZING and everyone DESERVES A PAT ON THE BACK. We are a very creative group so keep posting!!! I have been busy knitting dishcloths, haven't taken any photos yet but will do and then post them, I have done these for friends at work who have been so supportive so wanted to show my appreciation. Really easy and quick to do and able to pick up and put down whenever. I have done a few 'Breast Cancer Ribbon of Hope' in pink of course just to keep raising awareness. I have also knitted quite a few 'Knitted Knockers' in different sizes (again no pics but will download asap) and my chemo unit have welcomed them. I did these as i feel very lucky that I not had to have a masectomy and feel for the people who have to go through this. The chemo etc is bad enough without that as well. So... here is a couple of pics of the patterns I am about to start for my little grandaughter. Hope you like them and will post pics of the finished items.                        Love Edwina xx You\u2019re allowed to scream  - You\u2019re allowed to cry  - But do not give up",

I have been a knitter for many years and can do all the usual i.e. cables, fair isle, intarsia etc but have always knitted on straight needles. Why do I need circular\u2019s I asked myself?? A lot of ladies think they are much better than straights. So, I asked hubbie for a set of circulars for Xmas, which I duly got and started straight knitting with them and had no long needles poking into me, got on great with them. So yesterday, I had a beautiful afternoon in the garden and actually knitted my first item in the round!!! So proud of myself, yes, there are a couple of mistakes however, the second one is even better. I now must say I much prefer circulars for ALL of my knitting now. The next thing is to teach myself continental knitting. This will be hard as have been a \u2018thrower\u2019 for too many years but I will overcome it and then see what I prefer.",

I am the same as Jacmatholmad, I too had lumpectomy followed by further surgery of lymph nodes which meant I am gong down the chemo route followed by radiotherapy. So, as GRANNY59 says a lot depends on what they have actually found and your results Originally I was having lumpectomy followed by radiotherapy which was a great relief however, after the lumpectomy they found lymph nodes infected so it all changed for me. Your team will meet up and discuss the best treatment for you based on their findings. Nothing to worry about and as previously said write everything down and take someone with you as it is usually a lot to take in at first. My DH always comes with me as I tend to forget what SE  I've had or questions needing asking and he always remembers!! Chemo brain I'm afraid. Rest assured, we have all been where you are now and lots are now coming out the other side and others are nearly there. We are all surviving this and you will too.

My saga today....hope I don't bore you all!!!! Zap no. 8 today, halfway through. Appointment for 13.45. Got there at half one (usually early) got called in an HOUR later. Now this is unusual where I attend as always seen within half hour at the most. So, obviously something has happened so not unduly worried. Got changed and waited about another 15 mins. Eventually went in for RT treatment. Laid down, arms up etc etc. and they start shifting me about to \u2018line me up\u2019. Started breathing in and out when asked. Off they went to get the images. They were gone a good 20 minutes and left me with arms up and just completely numb and dead by now. They came back and said \u2018we are having trouble lining you up so sit up and wiggle your arms and hands. As we cannot get the images you can either go home and come back tomorrow or go and have a rest, we will see another patient and then try again when you have rested\u2019???? I said I would wait and try again. Half hour later I got called back in, went through all the same procedure and again left for ages. They called another radiographer to have a look as well. By now I was losing the will to live (never mind my arms!!). They then decided that we should leave it for today and try again tomorrow. When I asked if it was me or them they said me as I must have moved (didn\u2019t seem too sure if I had or not) and they saw I was wiggling my fingers. I said I always wiggle my fingers as they go numb and everything was OK last week (and I wiggled my fingers) and I hadn\u2019t moved. One of the radiologist said to take a couple of paracetamol about 20 minutes before my appointment tomorrow as this would help the pain in my arms and also relax me???? So, paracetamol is now a relaxant???? I am not sure if it is me or something else was going on. Has anyone else had this happen to them? I eventually left the hospital at 5pm and caught all the rush hour traffic and got home at 6.15pm. Annoyed is not the word I would use. Please someone tell me this is normal practice. Thank you for reading all through this without falling asleep!!! Aliblue Interestingly I had a midway review today to see how I was getting on (this was before the debacle that took place) and will have another near the end. All in all, I am fine at the moment. A little bit pink and some shooting pains which they said was quite normal.",

      "Content": "Well ladies thought I would give you an update on my \u2018traumatic day\u2019 on Monday. Went as usual on Tuesday, still waited an hour and found people were going in before me with later appointments!! (as you can see I have the bit between my teeth now!!). Finally got called and asked, very politely, were they running late and did I have the right time for my appointment? Yes, they said to both but got an apology this time. Anyway, two wonderful ladies I hadn\u2019t seen before. One said she heard I had a spot of bother yesterday, yes, I said. So, she said not too worry will get your sorted today. On the bed, lined up, images taken, RT given, all done. NO PROBLEMS at all. Amazing!! So, have gone today (no appointment yesterday, day off, probably sick of me). Same lady and man I had seen first week. On the bed, lined up off they went. Images taken however, had a bit of a problem with my breathing in but that got sorted. BUT\u2026 images had to be taken again. They came out and said I was slipping down the bed, very minutely but obviously puts the lining up out. Second time and all done and was still only about half hour. I have called my BC nurse and have told her what happened on Monday and she was so surprised that they did not give treatment that day, and yes, she said it is their job to ensure you are lined properly and not send you home like that. She is going to report it to the head honcho of Oncology and the head of RT and said she will let me know what they say. I will definitely be hated now, oh dear!!!! So, I now know I slip down the bed slightly, well, I can\u2019t be the only one who never, ever moves a millimetre am I??? ha ha I don\u2019t think so. Anyway, feel better now I know what it is, even though I asked on Monday and got very vague answers with nothing positive. Having said I\u2019m feeling better is not true. I feel totally fed up today. Think it is all now getting too much. I am back at work, albeit on reduced hours, the travelling every day and I\u2019m only number 9 today which, if machines and staff were not broken I would be 13!!! Two days to the finish line, instead another 6 still to go. Well, I hope everyone is having a better time than me. It does sound that way from your responses. Long may it last and the best of luck to all.",

So far I'm only a bit pink and slightly sore nipple but nothing I can't handle. It's just that it has taken me into a 4th week instead of 2 or even maybe 3, so just a bit fed up tonight but it will pass.

Mine cleared quite quickly but I did have an irritation on my arm that felt like my arm had rubbed badly on something and was very irritating however, after speaking to the BC nurse and, of course, with is wonderful community it all proved to be quite normal.

Doctor gave me codiene and said Ican take it with ibuprofen as well. He said should not take the co-codamol as too much paracetamol!!  When I follow posts on here there sems to be mixed consensus on what we are told by our Onco's. To be honest not sure if it has made any difference anyway, as today took steroids this morning and been pretty good all day but felt that wearing off at about 6ish so have taken painkillers a little while ago but fingers and toes still tender whereas they were fine all day with steroids!!! Yes, my brows and eyelashes have nearly all gone now as well. Well, it must be good if your first cycle is not too bad as according to others on here most have said the first is the worst and calms down on following cycles. So fingers crossed it will be good to both of us. Take care xxx This has definately got a lot to answer for!!",

Both are very apt!!  It is only now I am getting some relief with the steroids and codeine that has been prescribed. toxophilite  Yes, the red face is very becoming!!!  And red eyes to go with it.  Lucky not had any skin peel on face (but who knows) and yes, painkillers will be taken VERY early next time. I really did not think it could be as bad as what people described and it is one of these things you have to experience first hand to empathise and sympathise with others. Have a great wekend ladies,  I am going to keep taking the medicine!!!!",

Went to pharmicist and, as only just finished chemo, would not recommend anything and advised doctors. Seems such a minor thing to go to the doctors with however, made appointment and saw a doctor I had not seen before. So told him what I was there for and felt a bit guilty wasting his time, and said I had been to see chemist but they advised to see doctor. So, he said, do you suffer with hay fever? No I said. (felt like saying I would know what it was if I did!!). Emm he said, well nothing I can do????? Oh really i'm thinking. Well, I will give you some drops and see if it clears up otherwise you might have blocked tear ducts and will have to see an eye specialist!!. Great I'm thinking. Gone to pick up prescription and he has given me eye drops for hay fever!!!! Could have got the same thing over the counter. I know in my heart of hearts it is due to the chemo but just wanted to be sure, not a lot to ask. Anyone else suffering/suffered with this? Doesn't hurt at all and is not infected as clear tears all the time and is only in one eye.",

I didn\u2019t think I could get them tattooed and wasn\u2019t really sure I wanted something as permanent as that anyway, but definitely won\u2019t think about it now!! My eyebrows have always been a bit sparse the older I\u2019ve got so think will practice with eyebrow wand from Benefit that I have got. Bigguy and MaggsT   I am going to enquire at my local Boots as it is a fairly big one and get some help! Teeshun    Thanks for the advice, funnily enough I was using fake tan during the winter to give me that healthy glow, have now got a little bit of sun which has helped. Going into work tomorrow to \u2018plan\u2019 my phased return. Should be interesting mops   Many thanks. What a good idea, will definitely looking into that idea about glasses. SueG   Yes, my eyes are very sore at the moment and I usually wear a fringe (with my wig) so will bear that in mind! Nutmeg56   Ha ha I am a young 64. I have a minute silver hedgehog on my head which is STILL slowly disappearing!! Make up is all new to me as well as have not bothered with hardly any for years but definitely need something now with chemo/steroid face and eyes it is pretty horrific!! A big thank you to you all for the invaluable advice it is much appreciated. Good luck with all your appointments and treatments. I have nothing until July now, seems really weird not traipsing to the hospital every week for one thing or another!!!!",

      "Content": "maggiemee; Ginacarla Hi ladies. I too am on Letrozole and have all the side affects you are both talking about. I am also reluctant to change as they all seem to have the same side effects so it might just be that one brand suits you better than another. I am also on Letrozole for 10 years and my thinking is: 1. It is keeping the cancer gremlin\u2019s away and \u2026\u2026 2. Hopefully my body will eventually get used to it!!! (fingers crossed) I will say I am back at work and the more active I am the better I feel. I admit I don\u2019t exercise much and some people have said they feel a lot better with regular walking or some other form of exercise. (I\u2019m just too lazy!!). I have also started taking cod liver oil with calcium as there was an old post on here that someone said they were pain free while taking this supplement. Too early for me as only started this week however, if it works I will definitely let everyone know as so many of us are suffering through Letrozole. If you search 'Letrozole' on here there are pages about it. xx",

Also you will have horrible hard stubble which is uncomfortable. Obviously only my advice but my little hedgehog I have left is lovely and soft. Also think about investing in a silk pillowcase. good luck",

How interesting and refreshing to find that there are people out there that understand what you could possibly go through when treatment finishes. I have just finished all mine, my last RT was on Thursday. Much as I am relieved and happy I didn't sleep well last night and consequently feel quite emotional today. Reading this article also brought a tear as some of it was definately me!!!! Many thanks for sharing this and would urge anyone finishing or finished treatment to read this, no matter how well you think you are it is definately worth a look.",
