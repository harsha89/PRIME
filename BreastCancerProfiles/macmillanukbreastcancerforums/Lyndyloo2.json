I will most probably find out next week if it's worked, I'm booked down for it for the next session too, it's bearable but cold and headachy for the first 10-15 mins but after that your brain accepts the cold, i just felt if I don't try it I will never know if I can save my hair.  Your hair can still thin a little/lot but everyone is different.  I have my wig already just incase it doesn't work.

It looks like from the replies on here that everyone thinks you should leave it and let it grow.  I have an appointment Friday with a hairdresser who deals with chemotherapy and will see what they say about keeping the fluff or shaving it off...I will keep you informed :) Lynne :)",

I am coming to terms with it a bit now, at first I felt like you - just numb, that's the only way to describe it, people were reacting to me different, tiptoeing around the subject as they thought I would burst into tears.  I know so much how you're feeling, I had no appetite and just felt drained, I cried but on my own as not to upset anyone around me, It took me a while to actually have a full nights sleep but now I feel a bit calmer towards it all and am sleeping a bit better. Your appointment with a Macmillan nurse with reassure you tomorrow, they are fantastic and know exactly how you're feeling, I've found the posts on here quite good - lots of good advice. Good luck tomorrow, Lynne xx",

Any advice would be good  or just how to cope with the first course of chemotherapy, it's all so frightening!  ",
