    "Content": "Morning. I was also asked to consider this trial back at the end of last year. I finished my last chemo on January 5th and feel really good. Iv had all the tests required to take part and started this trial 4 days ago. I'm also at Southampton general. Jenny the research nurse is just wonderful. Few jiggly stomach aches but it's early days. I'm so happy to be helping out. Apparently they keep testing patients and a lot fail to tick all the boxes. Good luck with the rest of your treatment  Lauren ",
