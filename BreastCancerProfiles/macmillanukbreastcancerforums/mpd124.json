    "Content": "Hello. I hope this helps some of you.  I had stage 4 lung cancer and got done chemo at the end of  March this year.  I'm doing great and no sign of the cancer anywhere so far.  I was given Opdivo treatment..I got 2 series of treatment  (back to back)  did very well.  But then came the rash...the rash has  water bubble that breaks and gets your clothes wet and sticky.   I was covered by this rash and still am. I saw 3 different dermatologist.....none of them had seen this rash before..Opdivo is a newly treatment not much is known about it.   I was given hight dosage of prednisone..but as soon as you get off prednisone the rash comes right back.  It does keep the itching away though so I am staying on 15 mg just to keep the itching away...It's a nasty rash and predinisone just as nasty.   This is a rash that needs to be kept mosit...so I take a shower morning and night and cover myself with creams given to me by the dermatologist.These are the names of the cream....Triancinolone Cream....Betamethasone Diproponate Cream..Triancinolone Acetonide Ointment,   My scalp is covered..so I bought over the counter Dermarest (Shampoo and Conditioner)  I believe that the last few days I got to understand that this rash is here to stay as long as it wishes and will leave when it's ready too..  It is an immune system rash,it is fighting the change that the chemo had made to my system. I have a very strong immune system and I am very lucky for that..that is what help me fight the cancer.   It is fighting and it gets confused resulting into this rash.   Once it accepts the changes to my system the rash will go away. Ive been through hell with this rash but now I decided to make friends with it.  I am eating very healthy, walking, working out  and hopefully my system will accept the changes.I have a lot to be grateful for and I hope you all have too. Be well! God Bless.....",
