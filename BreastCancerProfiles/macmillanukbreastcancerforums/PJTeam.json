    "Content": "Hi there, I was also diagnosed in March with grade 3 and 1/5 nodes affected. I had a mastectomy with immediate reconstruction in April and meet my oncologist to agree chemo plan on 28/514, so can totally empathise with where you are and how you are feeling. It's tough, I'm 46 years old and raise my 15 year old son on my own but you HAVE to stay positive to get through the rest of your chemo journey and beyond.... You HAVE to do this for YOU and for your family and friends.... The best advice I have been given is not to look too far into the future and to try to take things one step at a time.... I try to think about it as a hurdle race and just concentrate on the next hurdle rather than worrying about the hurdles down the line.... I've also bought a few books to help with positive mental attitude they are both by Rhonda Byrne, one is called The Secret and the other is called The Magic. They both give you tools/ways to focus on positivity and visualising where you want you life/health to be in the future. I would strongly recommend them. Remember there is a CAN in CANcer - so try to stay strong and make every day count! Best wishes for better days ahead and good health in the future. Take care. P xx",
