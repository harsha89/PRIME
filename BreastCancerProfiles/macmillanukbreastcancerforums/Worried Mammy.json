    "Content": "Hi all ive joined this forum because my anxiety is at an all time high. Im 27 found a lump on left breast this week. Attended GP same day who said she thinks its just cystic but referred me to breast clinic anyway. I also have shoulder pain, chest pain, arm pain and some leg pain. I booked a private appointment to be seen in 2days time but im so so worried. Has aby of you ever heard of a wrong GP diagnoses? Many thanks",
