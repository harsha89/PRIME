      "Content": "Sally  Sorry to hear your having a crappy time and feeling low. I am not even close to where you are with treatment at the moment so I can only imagine what you're going through. However going out and doing fun stuff I think certainly helps. Having stuff planned a little way in advance helps to have something to look forward to (granted I'm sure it's dependant on how you feel on the day but nonetheless). My partner and I have decided to have something planned once a month, nothing major but a little treat for us both. We're having a little overnight stay in a hotel next week and planning a few spa sessions for the end of the month. Just little things to look forward to. Who'd you go see?  Sending you hugs xx",

      "Content": "Got my first appointment with the oncologist on Monday and now my MRI scan has been bought forward to Saturday now after getting a cancellation. To be honest I'm just more worried about getting the rest of the tests back now. I feel like I am ready to cope with the treatment for the breast cancer although that may just be blind naivety more than anything else! I need to get some questions together though this weekend where people have mentioned asking for a certain combination of drugs before surgery. Nice to hear that people are coping with the chemo and making their way through things and feeling more positive about seeing the light at the end of the tunnel which gives reassurance.  Xx",

Still hopeful I'll be able to manage some exercise but I haven't even started treatment yet and feeling tired and sick of the poxy hospital with all the tests. I'm very lucky compared to some people who still have to work and care for a family so can't grumble too much I guess. Just want to get on with it now though x",

      "Content": "Might seem a bit of a daft question but I was wondering how people coped with the fatigue? I know everyone's different but wondered how bad can it get? Are we talking days on end without getting up or less? Also what's the average length of time in between sessions and does the fatigue wear off over the following few days? And finally I've heard a bit about cold caps what is this? I'm thinking about leaving the hair to see what happens and hope for the best but unsure if it'll become too painful maybe if I leave it too late to shave it off. Read someone on here done it with a bottle champagne and personally I could see myself doing that with my other half just us get wrecked and trying out some ridiculous hair styles along the way!  Thanks in advance  JennyEm  Xxx",

      "Content": "That's impressive that it worked when nothing the docs gave did then! I'm gonna keep taking it (bought it now, well the other half did anyway) but think the salt water will be worth it to and I'll ask about the doctor for the mouth wash (well given we've got NHS exemption card things might as well make the most of it!). I've never been one for supplements or taking medication but I've found myself ordering all sorts on the internet. I've even bought a poxy nutibullet thing although most of the mixtures I've thrown together have been like drinking swamp water",

I was thinking as it is now I could maybe donate it but if I wait then it falls out in bits and pieces then it's no good to anyone. Personal choice I guess x",

Re the whole sore mouth thing I've heard high strength Manuka Honey is suppose to help I've bought some on line as it was much cheaper then in the shops (£50!!). I've got the 24+ one. Tablespoon a day in a honey and ginger drink. Anyone find this benifical after they started? Xx",
