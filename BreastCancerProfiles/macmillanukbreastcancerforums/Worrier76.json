      "Content": "Wow Tingk I don't usually post but felt I had to when I read this. This is an almighty c0ck-up on behalf of your hospital. If lumpectomy was a possibility at the beginning of treatment, they absolutely should have put a marker in before the end of neoadjuvant chemo (ideally before it started). Surgery is always done for primary BC - unless you're part of one of the trials that your surgeon mentions I don't think you will be able to dodge it. So, unless a mastectomy was always on the cards, it sounds like your hospital's negligence has caused you to need to have much more invasive surgery than was necessary.  I'm not litigious but if I were you I would take legal advice. At the very least, you deserve a huge apology from the hospital and an assurance that lessons have been learnt.  I wish you all the best in the next phase of your treatment.",

      "Content": "Good for you, jmc1002, it's a great thing you're doing! I started going to a local Breeze ride last year, when I was looking to get fit after chemo (I was busy and active before but did no regular exercise) and can definitely recommend them! The rides are graded and at some of ours they even lend you a bike (good for me as I don't have one!). They are really friendly and you don't need to be a cycling nut to go. It's a really good network and I'd recommend anyone to go, no matter how unfit you are.",
