      "Content": "It gets better!  Unfortunately, sickness is harder to treat once it gets a grip but it will go.  Ask if they can change your meds from the start for the next round.  Emend is the really effective one.  Also, just because you are really sick on one round doesn't mean it will happen every time. I've been fasting on the day before, day of, and day after chemo - plenty of fluids but no more than 200 cals a day.  Can't say if this has helped, but I haven't had nausea on the rounds I've done it.

      "Content": "The horrible truth of the matter is that the vast majority of people who endure adjuvant chemo either don't need it, or don't benefit from it.  We are living with the reality of lack of medical knowledge combined with some very toxic chemicals, many of which are the same ones that have been used for decades.  They have serious short term and long term risks.  But then so does cancer. Personally, I think it sucks.  My own benefit was estimated at 3-4 percent, but the oncologist guesstimated it up to 6-7 percent because of the HER2+ status.  They don't actually have statistically reliable figures for HER2+ with regards to chemo but you have to have it, otherwise you can't have Herceptin.  To me, that still mean that I\"m more likely to be in the 93-94 women out of a hundred for whom chemo is of no benefit.  Good in some ways, but bad when you are suffering the side effects. If you are not HER2+, there is a test that can be done that examines your own case more accurately, with regards to the cancer markers.  It's called oncotype I think.  It's expensive, although some people seem to get it free (postcode lottery, again).   Whatever you decide, I think you have to set your mind to it and know that it was the right decision for you.  A rock and a hard place is a little bit what it feels like to me.",

Sugar also feeds yeast - and systemic candida (thrush) can be a real problem with chemotherapy. It can make you really ill as well as leaving oral and gastric lesions which make eating unpleasant. It's a toss up though because sometimes something sugary is all you really fancy (I see a lot of people suggesting ice pops and other sugary things while on chemo).  Personally, I have manuka honey to add sweetness, or even on its own.  It's a natural healer and will help strengthen the immune system rather than weaken it (as sugar can do).   You can get a free DVD that has advice on diet and other stuff from a place called The Haven.  If you live near a centre they also offer free complementary therapies and counselling.",

I don't think it is illegal for the hospital staff to make religious comments but they should probably be trained to keep their unverified views to themselves.  There are religious outlets at the hospital already for those who want them (prayer room etc).   It's possible some religiously-minded friends and family even thought my diagnosis might make me find some faith.  As if getting a nasty and potentially terminal illness is something that would suddenly make me think there is an all-powerful being deciding these things, who might turn it round if I whisper enough of the right words.

My oncologist gave me the survival sheets for my cancer stage (unfortunately they don't cover HER2 so they just make an educated guess with that one) and I was surprised to see I have a 2 percent chance of dying from something altogether different in the next 10 years anyway, and always have!   I think this disease screws with your head more than anything and a lot of that is fed by other people's fear of it too.  We're dealing with a massive human fear here - not just the the fear of dying but the fear of dying slowly and in pain.  Somehow we have to navigate ourselves around that along with the pressure to be positive all the time.   ",

I've been on tamoxifen for 2 weeks now and can honestly say I've not had any terrible side effects.  Upset tum for a couple of days (but could have been something else I'd eaten) and very mild and occassional sense of being overheated that I usually get before my period anyway - and since my period still started on the day it was due (wasn't expecting that to happen) I feel fine.  So think the so-called side effects were just my usual PMT. Tamoxifen is a very effective drug for ER+ cancer and I'd be willing to give it a go at least.  If the effects are too awful you can always stop taking it but you won't know unless you try. By serious side effects I assume you mean the slightly elevated risk of womb cancer?  My thinking is to deal with the here and now cancer.  The increased risk of future uterine cancer is very slight, especially if you have no additional risk factors.  Unfortunately it is much slighter than the risk of breast cancer recurrence.  ",

      "Content": "Most breast cancers contain parabens but using paraben-free cosmetics doesn't actually reduce risk from them because there are so many in the environment.  That's why there is no link between using paraben-free cosmetics and reduced breast cancer.  There are also many naturally occuring parabens such as in blueberries. I have changed to paraben-free stuff for most things but have to admit this is largely irrational.  What we do as an individual is a drop in the ocean compared to what we are doing as a society - it's the social (industrial) scale where the effects are largest.  Unfortunately, most public health campaigns don't highlight this.",

      "Content": "Hi Annie, So sorry to hear your results weren't what you were hoping for.  I really hope the tax does the trick against your primary and mets. I'm moving onto tax next week too, although I only have 3 and then a year of herceptin. Could they explain why some of the mets have shrunk?  Is it possible that there are a couple of different types of cancer cells and so some responded well to the first chemo, and the others may well respond well to the tax?  I'm not an oncologist so just guessing really.  The good thing is they still have some weapons up their sleeve to try.  You've already acheived a massive thing by getting through the first chemos - which did shrink some if not all of the cancer.    How are you feeling generally energy and healthwise at the moment?  Wishing you all the best for tax #1 and beyond.   Nicola x ",
