      "Content": "Hi all, find myself In a strange situation. 8 rounds of neoadjuvent chemo worked so well that there is no sign of the tumour in MRI or ultrasound scan. However, there was no marker put in at the original biopsy. The minor tissue conservation surgery cannot be completed as they cannot identify where the tumour was without the marker. Mastectomy is now the only way to safely proceed with surgery to a successful conclusion but is this really necessary given the results post chemotherapy as it seems so extreme now.",

      "Content": "Hi Worrier76, I'm the same as you regarding the  legal side, there is an investigation being undertaken which is most important to help make sure this doesn't happen again. Mastectomy was never on the cards because of the treatment plan and the success already seen within the trust. The only thing that would make me go legal is if I find out that my reconstruction will need future surgery in a maintenance capacity? I don't know much about it yet but in 10/15/20 years would I have to have further surgery to maintain the appearance of the reconstruction. I'm 51 so plan on being around for quite some time! Thanks for taking time to reply.",

      "Content": "Thanks for support. They do have scan and mammogram images but have said they aren't accurate enough for tissue conservation surgery. They have also tried rescanning for scar tissue indicating the area but they couldn't find anything. I have support in the appointments and will get all the info. I'm surprised there doesn't seem to be anyone in the same situation but relieved it's not a common occurrence. There are studies starting up on how to improve proceedings after cpr but nothing currently that gives enough evidence for my surgeon to advise anything different from mastectomy in this case. Thanks again.",

The team considered the no surgery option but felt there wasn't enough evidence to convince them it was viable. I am having Herceptin jabs continuing on from chemo. It could be down to the different health teams and their opinions I guess. I have to trust them as they have got me this far and I can't ignore the positive outcome from chemo. Thanks for the info re your friend too.",

I didn't think I would be the only one in this situation but can't find anyone with similar experience to call on for advice. I know I'll be fine in the end so just trying to focus on the end goal.",

      "Content": "Hi Vic, thanks so much for the response. That's all really useful information to have. They are going to tidy up my dog ears at the same time too. Sounds like my procedure will be similar to yours as they plan using inner thigh fat because there isn't much left on my tummy after the diep. I'm still considering whether to go for it or not as the prosthesis they've given me matches up pretty well for getting a bra to fit and clothes looking good. I've been through a lot in the last year with everything so just sure how much mores to put my body through! Really appreciate your input and this site in general has been very helpful. cheers Tingk x ",

I'm definitely getting dog ears done so kind of thinking I might as well get lipofill at same time. I have time because nothing will happen until around a year after mastectomy.  This site is so good for getting real experience advice, so appreciate you taking time to respond. good luck to you and everyone else on this road.

      "Content": " Hi all, i had a mastectomy with immediate DIEP flap reconstruction in July 2018. My newly constructed boob is quite a bit bigger than my healthy one and I'm considering having the healthy boob lipofilled to even them out. The surgeon recommends waiting until a year after the mastectomy and I know she will go through the whole process and options with me beforehand but I'm just curious about how it is done, how long it takes, are you under general anaesthetic, how long is the recovery. General information really if anyone can help? Thanks Tingk x",
