      "Content": "Hi am awaiting biopsy results (go back this Weds) but I was told when I had my mammograms done they were 95% certain that I had breast cancer. Was wondering was anyone else told this before biopsy results? Keep thinking is mammograms that effective  as a diagnostic tool that they could give me diagnosis without biopsy results??? Has anyone else had this? Head wrecked keep thinking about that 5%!",
