      "Content": "Hi, I know how scared you are feeling, i had two tumors one 4cm and one 8cm by 6cm and after a course of chemo , mastectomy and a blast of radio therapy my tumors have had a full response and have gone! I had some rough days as you will but ive felt like ive been in good hands all the way -  I was diagnosed on xmas eve, put on a brave face and got through the festive season for the sake of my daughter bacause thats what mums do . - you might want to scream and shout but once you have done that you will find the fighting spirit . i hope you have been given a breast care nurse? They will do everything they can to make sure your needs are met and will also help you with any questions you might have regarding treatment. you will find the strength from family and friends and your children. I was told yesterday that i was now a member of the Macmillan family and now you are too. There are loads of fantasic people on line with great advice and hints and tips on keeping positive and getting through IT!   You can beat this! x",

      "Content": "Great advice... one day at a time and you will get there. I too had a large tumor 8cm by 6cm and another lodged on my breast bone 4cm stage 3 and scarey. I was on the trial but not the extra drug - i was just given fec and taxioter in the reverse order. A full response and my tumors vanished. The only time i cried was the day i found out which was xmas eve. I had a bit of a spring clean and got my house in order so to speak- then i chose to fight and stay positive and i believe. I think my loved ones were the perfect people to unload my fears onto because they are going through it with me. They made me stay strong for them and Brought us even closer however, we are all different and deal with things differently which is the beauty of this site. sending you a hug xx",
