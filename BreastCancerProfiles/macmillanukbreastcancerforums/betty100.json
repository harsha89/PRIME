    "Content": "I had an extravasation injury (leak into my arm) on my last session of Taxotere. This was around 6 weeks ago and I am still suffering from horrible swelling and pain. My whole arm and hand blew up due to Â the effect of the chemical burn and I was in such excruciating agony to begin with I had to be on a round the clock cocktail of powerful painkillers. I was sent for a washout operation (slitting the arm open and draining the fluid) immediately after the accident but although the hospital played it down I think a whole load must have gone in for the effects to be this bad. I can't find anything on the web that reflects my experience and at times it feels like I'm going mad. I have already been through so much - with a protracted diagnostic procedures (uncovering 5 cm invasive lobular primary tumour, and 4 other tumours in the same breast - one large area of DCIS, one small area and one other small (less than 1cm) invasive lobular, 11 out of 12 lymph nodes affected, mastectomy, 6 sessions chemo - 3 FEC-T and 3 Tax, and 5 weeks radiation - currently half way through, I can hardly cope. I have 3 kids and life is tough. Can anyone help me or has anyone been through similar experiences? If so I'd love to hear from you.",
