      "Content": "Dreamthief Afternoon  Billybunter, Surely I am too young to remember that schoolboy ? So sorry to read about the worries with your wife and seeing you joining us here I don't want to alarm you any more than you already are but an inverted nipple was my wife's only symptom and she was diagnosed with breast cancer - it was only 8m/m and right behind the nipple and too small to feel.   OK, that is not what you wanted to hear but... That was over 5 years ago and she is thankfully still here and finding me jobs and decorating to do.Fingers crossed this is something like scar tissue from her previous surgery pulling it in, but if your fears are confirmed the treatments have improved greatly over the last 10 years so please put away these worries you may lose her. Obviously we would all prefer you both don't have to go down this road again but unless it is very advanced (which sounds doubtful) this may well be treated as recurrence and not secondary cancer. Keep chatting to us here and asking any questions you have until you know where this is going.

Take care, G n' J Hello and thankyou for a lovely reply it does give me some assurance as their is just the two of us,but after all these years I find it hauntingly scary as she in 2015had a carcinoma on the side of her nose which had to be removed and she endured pain from injections then, now this it just doesn't seem fair We have no family just the two of us and I'm disabled with a shattered back and a bad heart she cares for me and I try caring for her best I can, she's scared too.",

      "Content": "Thankyou for your reassurance we are both scared as their is only the two of us and it was noticed only last week but she has an appointment at the hospital in Lyn next Tuesday and we both hope it hasn't returned. She's scared which is obvious but the doctor who examined her couldn't feel anything around the nipple or on her breast generally so perhaps nothing is there as her lymph nodes were taken out under her right arm and she had drainage tubes their and on her back for a week and was put on taxifermin for 6 years so has it returned ! We hope not ",

      "Content": "KiwiCardi I had a mastectomy last year and since finishing chemo and radiotherapy the nipple on my remaining breast has started going in, so now it is completely inverted. I was full of anxiety and panic, but I saw my surgeon and he did an ultrasound scan on it and said it's just due to the ducts shortening and pulling the nipple in. He said it's fairly common in women as they get older and nothing to worry about. I've also had my first mammogram and that didn't detect anything either. Fingers crossed your wife will have something similar and it will just be a false alarm. thankyou for replying that's sort of eased our concerns my wife was full of panic but it's still worrying it's the manogram that reveals all, it the cancer we hope hasn't returned as it's in the breast she had the lumps removed. As said she had surgery 2006 on taxifermin till 2012 the only cancer she had was near her nose a carcinoma in 2015 which she had removed, this inverted nipple was only seen a week ago, when she went to the doctor's nothing was felt on the breast nor round the nipple or over the top so I hope it's not deep in the breast, as in 2006 the surgeon removed her lymph nodes under her right arm so it couldn't spread, and he removed two lumps he told my wife one was growing under the other so all we can do is pray it's not sinister. ",
