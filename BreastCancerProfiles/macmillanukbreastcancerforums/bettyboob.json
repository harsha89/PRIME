    "Content": "I'm due to have a mastectomy and lumpectomy on the 10th Sept. I'm told I can't have immediate reconstruction because of the radiotherapy interfering with the Diep reconstruction, if that's what I choose to have. I'm still undecided about which recon to go for, implants or Diep. My other concern is that I have stretch marks on my tummy, will that result in a new breast with stretch marks?",
