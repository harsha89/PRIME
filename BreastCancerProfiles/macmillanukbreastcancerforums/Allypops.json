      "Content": "It was never really resolved. It kept happening with each cycle of EC.  I was in hospital on cycle 3 with neutropenic sepsis and was examined by the general doctors who thought it could be an abscess or cellulitis in the affected breast but nothing showed up on ultrasound.  The experienced breast nurse said that they do see it at occasionally but it is not a common side effect. The onc wasn\u2019t concerned. It was very sore, hard, swollen and looked bruised.   After EC I had 4 accelerated Paclitaxel and didn\u2019t have this problem with that chemo.   I hope yours resolved and isn\u2019t too sore. xx",

      "Content": "It did shrink a bit, but it was less dense rather than smaller. It then shrank more on Paclitaxel.  I\u2019m not  having surgery until January so quite a while to wait to find out how much of lump was left. x",

      "Content": "Hi, room for another July chemo starter? I was diagnosed on 31st May.  Initially it was going to be a lumpectomy and radio but after mri and more biopsies, the doctors found other areas of cancer in the same boob so chemo first, then probable mx. Tumour is er8/8, pr8/8, HER2-. Chemo is 4xEC then Accelerated Taxol.  I had first EC on Friday 13th.  Feeling a bit groggy and weak so far but not too bad.  Today though, my bad boob is sore and hard.  No temperature but I am a bit worried about why my boob hurts in case it is growing instead of shrinking. I am not cold capping and so next stop on Friday is choosing a wig.  Hope you\u2019re all ok Allypops",
