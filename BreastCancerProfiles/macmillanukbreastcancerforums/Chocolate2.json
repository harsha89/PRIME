Sometimes the waiting for surgery and results is often the worst, You will get through this difficult time You have friends and family to support you, but sometimes it's nice to hear advice/ support from women who have gone through the same/ similar experience. Within a month,I  have been diagnosed, had surgery and now going to have chemotherapy, so I do understand how you feel Hope all goes well for you",
