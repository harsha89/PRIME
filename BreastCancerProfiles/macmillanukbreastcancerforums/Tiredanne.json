      "Content": "Hi Mamma3, the cold cap didn't work for me unfortunately. Left me with excrutiating headaches later in the day AND.....I still lost all my hair!! When the headaches came they were bad!!!! I became a total Sweary Mary & potty mouth :-D. I have a wig but only wore it twice, I thought it looked so false. Got 3 scarf things & only ever wore 1 & only around the house. They SCREAM cancer. I was 'lucky' in that my hair loss was over the winter (thought I'd got away with it, finished chemo in Aug with thinning hair but by Oct it had all gone :-( ). I wore a bobble hat if ever I needed to go out anywhere (mostly appointments) & felt a lot better about myself :-). Had my mx in Sept last year & finished radio in Dec, just in time for Christmas. I have about 3 to 4 inches of hair now, grey & CURLY!! & a wonferful hairdresser who has given me a brill cut & showed me how to dry it flat. Get yourself a pretty summer hat. Positives of having cancer.....I've learnt to be more patient, tolerant, accepting, I've lost 2 1/2 stone and......short hair suits me, makes me look younger :-D :-D. Does anyone on here want a wig & scarves?",

I did worry a lot about him & my son Antony throughout treatment, hard for them too. How will they cope if I pop off? Who will look after my dog & 2 cats? BUT.....I'm still here & feeling better every day.",

      "Content": "Hi unicorn12, I felt like you, felt every emotion going.....disbelief, shock, anger, fear, sad...it's a total rollercoaster &, apart from all this emotional stuff, you're ill!! My son is 29 & it was still hard telling him. I was diagnosed in April 2017Â  had chemo from May till Aug, a left side mx in Sept & 15 rounds of radio which finished in Dec. Got the all clear in Jan this year & on 2 lots of tabs for 3 years & another lot for 10 years. I won't lie to you, some of it was very hard going & I had some very dark days. Went to bed & bawled my head off. BUT......I'm here.....I've done it & so will you. During the dark days you feel \"I can't do this\" but you can & will. I PROMISE things do get better & easier & life is good again.",

      "Content": "Docetaxal is horrible, I really struggled whilst on it & was quite ill. Was more bothered about losing my hair than my boobie!! Hair's back now, short but there, & I'm going to colour it in a few mins :-). Couldn't have an immediate recon cos the chemo made me so ill. I was devastated but 8 months down the line I don't know whether I want a recon? I'm not specially 'well endowed' & do I want another 6 hour op? It's hard & no one can decide for us ( I wish).",
