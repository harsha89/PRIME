      "Content": "Hello Sammystaff, I am sorry to hear about your diagnosis, but I welcome you to the community. I popped over from the womb cancer forum to say hello and can at least relate to having trouble sleeping. You have come to a very supportive community here and the breast cancer groups are massively supportive, and I am sure someone will be along to share their experiences very soon. Have you been given a timeframe for your results, I know waiting on results is really daunting and very scary. You have all kinds of things rushing though your head. But strangely enough it\u2019s often easier to know exactly what is wrong and have a treatment plan in place. Please be reassured that you will get lots of support every step of the way and of course you can ask questions from the experts online as well as the shared experience from others. Sending you a gentle hug and best wishes.",

      "Content": "Thankfully you know when you will get your results it seems about the right timeframe, one of my friends has breast cancer which was diagnosed just before Christmas and I think it was 10 days to get her biopsy results back. I am sure it will feel a very long week but again it\u2019s nerves. I don\u2019t think I slept well at all when I was waiting on results. I was diagnosed last June with womb cancer after months of problems and pain and the unknown. I was in total shock I suppose it\u2019s normal I don\u2019t think I have excepted it all yet, I do keep thinking it\u2019s happened to someone else. But being only 38 and pre menopause having a total hysterectomy with ovaries and tubes removed put me in the surgical menopause, luckily I feel blessed it\u2019s not effected me too badly - yet, but I better not jinx myself and the doctor will not recommend hrt because of me being high risk breast cancer so I too keep checking my breasts for any changes especially due to complications in my abdomen that their not sure what is happening but I get breast pain on my right side which they believe is caused by my liver being enlarged. But what I will say is I hope you are fortunate to have a great medical team looking after you, trust is so important. Have you been assigned as specialist nurse (CNS for short) they are a great resource to ask questions to and are your link to your medical team. Each team have a MDT meeting in which everyone involved in your care discuss how your going to be treated and they all meet on different days at different hospitals, mine is a Wednesday.  Just remember your doing all the right things I know that must sound strange but expressing your feelings helps you to cope and here your free to rant and vent all the frustration and worries. Because chances are there is someone else feeling the same. Try to get some sleep I know your worried but sleeping will help, but your not alone with having trouble sleeping. If you want a bit of light relief during this time there is a really good thread called AWAKE  in the breast cancer group, I will admit to finding it funny but very supportive.Sending a gentle hug.",
