      "Content": "Hi, a good friend of mine has very recently been diagnosed with breast cancer and after a whirlwind of tests she's already launched into chemotherapy.  Any advice on help I can give would be much appreciated.  I've read some of the posts about the ways in which people feel terrible but if anyone had any specific advice about things that would help them feel better - any kind of beauty/health treatments or bits of clothing or house things to make their life easier, I'd be really glad. thanks!
