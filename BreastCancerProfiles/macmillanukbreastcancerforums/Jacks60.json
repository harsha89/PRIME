      "Content": "Hi I was offered chemo as apparently I was borderline. I asked the oncologist what she would recommend and she said for me to have it as there was a slightly higher chance of it returning within the next 10years without chemo so I am going to have it. Although I do think it's the right decision for me I am also very aware that the oncologist has to cover herself ( as we all have to in our work ) so she  's not going to advise me against it as I'm not going to be best pleased if it returns say next year. So I still have some uncertainties. I am concerned about side effects both long and short term and the impact on my life again long and short term. On the other hand as things mess with my head quite easily, if I don't have chemo I think I would be paranoid about every twinge, ache etc that I feel and would convince myself that the cancer had returned. I actually don't think either decision for me is ideal but at some point you have to make the decision and deal with what it throws at you. I start my chemo next Thursday and between now and then my brain will probably be doing somersaults and getting clogged down with \"what if's\" Sorry if I've confused you more just wanted to share that I understand where you're at but I'm afraid I haven't come up with an answer!  Jackie x",

      "Content": "Hi M i too start chemo on 2nd April. I have my initial assessment on 31st March so we will be going along our journey at the same time. I was in a state of absolute terror before having my op and it was nowhere near as bad as I thought so I'm trying to be a bit more rational about chemo. I have loads of leaflets to read but I don't feel I want to read them. I'm not sure if it would be better if I did or to just refer to them if I need to. So I'm afraid I can't offer any advice or answer any questions but maybe we can support each other during the next few months. Jackie x",
