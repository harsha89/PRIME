      "Content": "Hi Julia, No the didnt run through the riskier side effects, but I am keeping a log of anything I experience.  I am just amazed at how many people feel they are entitled to say what they wish.  I remember telling someone when I was first diagnosed, that out of group of four friends, that I meet up with, three of us have now had breast cancer... to which she said 'oh are the others still alive'.  Shocking yes, but my Managers remark made me feel vulerable, I guess its because I have been fighting to carry on as close to normal as I can, and as positive as I can, so it just made step back a bit.

      "Content": "One of my managers came to see me at home yesterday. We were generally talking about who will cover my work for me, (I have 2 out of my 6 FEC-T treatments so far, and decided maybe I should have a break from work now). I was telling her how I was lucky that so far I have not experienced much in the way of side effects and it's the loss of hair that has had the most impact on me, but generally I'm well and still the feel the same as I was pre-chemo. When she said 'you are aware that some side effects are irreversible '!! I pushed the comment aside, but it's bothered me all night.. I really can't understand why she would have said that too me, are they expecting me to return with less capacity to do my work ... sorry to rant , but this has really set my paranoia off. I've even been on line looking at permanent side effects",

I did go to the look good feel better session , amazed by the products they give you and the advice regarding eyebrows . I never had to pluck mine much, but remember the pain it caused. At the moment I'm using eyebrow pencils , although I have got some false eyebrows , I can't bring myself to wear them. Also using eyeliner for my eyes , to give them some colour. Getting ready to leave the house is an ordeal! ",
