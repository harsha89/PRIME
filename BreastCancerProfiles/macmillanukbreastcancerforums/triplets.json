    "Content": "Hi Joanne, My husband had one put in in June, it does put an end to all those needles, and he found the process painless. The only problem he had was it got blocked causing a blood clot, so it had to be removed and another one fitted. It was basically the hospitals fault, they had him in suffering with dehydration as he also has a ileostomy bag, they forgot to flush it, hence the clot! Harry has to have another 3 months of chemo after liver surgery, so the line will stay in. The only bug bear is that it must be flushed every week whether you are using it or not!",
