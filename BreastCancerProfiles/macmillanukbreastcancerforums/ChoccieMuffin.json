      "Content": "My immediate family know (4 kids from 23 - 12), but I'd rather keep most of my life \"normal\", so I'm not going to go broadcasting it until I'm at the stage of needing a bit of help with things, then the people you tell don't feel so bad because they can then actually do something practical, so everyone feels better. Until then I'd rather be allowed to just get on with stuff and not have that blasted word twisting everything. At the moment I don't need the practical support and I'm going to use you lot for any emotional support, if you don't mind.  I had a row with my 14-yr-old last night over just ordinary stuff that was none of the cancer's business and in normal circumstances it would have been a storm in a teacup, but of course with cancer sticking its nose in, the argument went nuclear. I'm still really upset about the row and am now feeling pathetic and sorry for myself, as well as feeling horrible for upsetting her. I am angry that I can't even have a normal family argument without it butting in! As for the rest of my family, I don't have much to do with my sister and she's quite a way away, so I wouldn't expect to tell her now. My dad has his own health worries to deal with and is already being really lovely in other ways not connected with it, so he's already helping me out more than I could dream of, bless him. As there's nothing MORE he can do for me, I'll leave the light off there for a while until I know a bit more, as there's no point in getting him worrying when I only have scant information at the moment. I might tell him once I've seen the surgeon, but for now I don't want him to worry when there's no point at the moment. He's no spring chicken, and we lost my mum many years ago to cancer (a different type) so he would find it very upsetting and frightening when the prognosis from what I currently know is so positive. My boyfriend knows but he has his own health worries (waiting for heart surgery) so the timing really sucks - I was intending being his chauffeur and runner-about-after once he's had his op, but the calendar looks like he'll be out of action just when I'm likely to need someone to run round after me. Think we'll have to do a bit of head-scratching. Had a phone call from my GP earlier today, just to let me know that she knows and that they're there for me if I need them. A very nice lady, my GP. Thing is, I'm fine if people are ordinary to me, I just fall to bits when people are nice! (That's nothing to do with the current situation, it's a long-standing self-esteem thing I've had for as long as I can remember, but it's a bloody nuisance.)",

      "Content": "First post on here, so hello. I'm much earlier in the story than others who have posted on this thread, having just had diagnosis following a core biopsy (IDS, Grade 2, 16mm), and haven't even seen the surgeon yet. I'm still at the stage of reading everything I can find and trying to put my own situation in perspective, so I'm hoping to learn from the experiences of others and have somewhere to off-load when I don't want to bore (or scare) the pants off my family. A little thought for you - it's bad enough to have this condition, but does it HAVE to have the same name (IDS) as a politician?!  ;-)",

      "Content": "Keep your fingers crossed for me tomorrow, please. It's been 14 days since I first saw the doctor at the clinic as referred by my GP and had the core biopsy (bruises still pretty, a nice shade of greeny yellow now). Saw her again last week for the results and the dreaded diagnosis, so tomorrow I meet the consultant for the first time and find out what she's actually going to do to me. I have an idea of what I think is likely, but of course I'm not the oncologist so I'm not the expert. As the lump is small and the nodes looked very good on the ultrasound last week I'm hoping for lumpectomy followed by radio, but as it's grade 2, who can tell. I have to admit I'm feeling very odd about the whole thing. One moment I'm having palpitations and bursting into tears, the next I'm just breezing along and feeling a bit like a fraud because I don't feel any different physically today to how I felt three weeks ago before I'd cheerily taken what I thought were a couple of breast cysts off to the doc. It's a bit like how I felt when I'd found out I was pregnant for the first time but hadn't had any symptoms, so it all feels very unreal. Reckon reality's going to hit me in the guts tomorrow afternoon though. I've got a busy morning going on tomorrow so I won't have time to work myself up in to a state of panic, which is a good thing. I'll post tomorrow to let you know how I get on.",

      "Content": "Oh yes, the kids and their exams. My biggies had a seriously pants run-up to their GCSEs and A Levels a few years. Not cancer-related, but an absolutely massive pile of poo for us all to deal with, and it wasn't pretty. Thanks for the other possible side of the coin re how it's possible to feel during treatment. I've been hearing lots of people saying how exhausting it is, and being a single parent of two still at home and no other parent to take the pressure from the kids, I admit I'm very nervous about how I'm going to cope with treatment, so your post has been really encouraging. I know that it's all just crystal ball gazing and there's no way I can tell how I'm going to feel through treatment, but it's really nice to know that not everyone get the \"hit by a truck\" feeling.",

      "Content": "Thanks tessa. I still don't know what I'm going to get as the consultant now wants me to have an MRI scan to check exactly what we're dealing with. This is because the lump we know is there doesn't show up on the mammogram so she wants to be absolutely certain that there isn't anything else that needs to be dealt with. The \"problem\" with an MRI is that it shows up loads of stuff including things they're not worried about, like cysts and I already know I have loads of them. So I may THEN need to have further core biopsies or have cysts aspirated, and depending on the result of either the MRI (if it can be read clearly) or any other biopsies I might end up with a lumpectomy or a full mastectomy, or if the MRI is really dreadful (and I'm being really negative here), have them both off. So I'm afraid it's more waiting for me, with surgery now not happening until the new year some time and I don't know what surgery I'll be having. Urgh. Oh well, there's nothing I can do to speed up the process and I have to admit if I'm going to have to have a mastectomy or two I'd rather know before the op than have the fear going into it that I might wake up tit-less. And on the positive side it'd be good to know for sure that there isn't anything else in there because they looked and found that it was clear rather than just them not finding anything because they haven't looked closely enough.",
