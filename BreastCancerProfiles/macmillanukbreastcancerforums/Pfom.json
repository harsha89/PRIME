      "Content": "Hi All, I am having my 1st session of EC chemo next week ( first of 4 plus 4 of T). I need to decide if I should use the cold cap or not.  I suffer from migraines, triggered by stress ( actually they strike when I start relaxing)  and by my periods ( so at least once a month I have a crisis that will last 1 to 3 days). Usually I take a pill (my lucky pill) that reduces the pain to bearable levels and allows me to have a \"normal\" life. This medication still hasn´t been approved by my oncologist as it is not a migraine medicine. Most of the migraine medication doesn´t work out with me and the pain without medication it is unbearable. If I didn´t suffer from migraines I would give at least a try to the cold cap but just the thought of the cold cap triggering one of my migraines crisis and have to deal with them together with the chemo side effects it is scaring me. Can anyone who suffers from migraines tell how the cold cap affected their migraines? And the chemo itself does trigger migraines as well? Any personal experience shared will be much appreciated. Thanks. Paula ",

      "Content": "Hi JudyR58, Thank you for your email. The possibility of not having migraines while on treatment is very comforting. Hope it will happen the same to me.  I used very short hair ( almost men style) for 15 years and I actually enjoyed it. The hair doesn't define me as a person ( actually I am more worried in loosing eyebrows and eyelashes) but the image of me bald it has been quite hard to imagine and accept. I am also very practical and the extra time and extra care that you have to put into it doesn't attract me either.Put extra pain on top.... Tomorrow I am going to try some wigs and head accessories and if I feel comfortable with it I decided not to use the cold cap. At the moment I am in the middle of a light migraine crisis of 3 days and If I had to put sickness on top of it I wouldn't be able to handle it. Nothing like reality to force you to make a decision lol Thank you for sharing your thoughts. Paula",

      "Content": "When I was diagnosed last August I started researching as much as I could about cancer. I got to the conclusion that having or not cancer it comes down to our immune system to be prepared to kill the cancer cells when they \u201cshow\u201d up. If in one of these moments our immune system is not in conditions to protect us that is when we are in trouble.  I also had a proper lifestyle before I was diagnosed but unfortunately I coudn\u2019t keep that lifestyle through the entire year. There were several periods (sometimes up to 3 months) of stress and lots of overtime at work when my diet was crap and I didn´t have the time to go to the gym- perfect conditions for cancer to develop . We just need the bad luck of the faulty cells to come up in one of these periods... I know it is a very simplistic explanation but it works for me ;) I am triple negative, grade 3, which means that after the chemo, the surgery and the radio, conventional medicine can´t do anything else for me. I am on my own until recurrence\u2026 But I have a powerful ally: my immune system. And I decided to help this friend of mine, which so many times I neglected, as much as I can and not leave it to luck: 1. Stress leaves immune system vulnerable. So I will have a balance between work and private life and will find techniques to stop worrying too much. Things eventually will be sorted out, even if you don´t worry about it. Please be aware \u201cdon\u2019t worry\u201d doesn\u2019t mean not taken action. 2. I am trying yoga, meditation, acupuncture, massage shiatsu, Qigong . They help with stress. There are several charities that will offer you some classes for free or at affordable prices. I will select 2 for after treatment and will attend them religiously. 3. Going to the gym 4 days a week religiously 4. Beauty products (make up, creams ...): I am sourcing ones that are made of natural and organic ingredients. Your skin is the largest organ you have and when you start investigating the things you put on it is appalling. 5. Diet: my main changes were: - I try to buy organic as much as I can afford. For me is important to not overwhelm my immune system with the chemicals that non organic food might have. At the moment I am having chemo so order using Ocado as they deliver at home and they have very vast organic offer. - Lots of vegs and fruit \u2013 I was doing this already but I am trying new recipes where I can include garlic, quinoa, spinach , fennel, kale, avocado, broccoli, etc - I eat whenever possible whole foods: processed foods not only loose most of the nutrients you need to reinforce your immune system but some will also have added preservatives or other chemicals - Alcohol: stop drinking on my early 30's - Red meat: very rarely used to eat it so stop having it for good - No refined sugar: I replaced by xylitol. Outside home use brown sugar. - Dairies: the ones that come from cows might have hormones, antibiotics and other chemicals. I miss cheese so sometimes buy organic cheese or feta cheese just to end with the cravings. - A recent study came for triple negative only: they found out a direct relation between cystine  levels and TNBC: today.duke.edu/.../breast-cancer-cells-starve-cystine Controlling cystine levels might reduce cancer cells or even eliminate them. I am only doing this while I think I have cancer cells inside me. Yes, reducing food that produces cysteine might not affect cancer but if I replace the list of items by vegetables or fruit , with same nutrients while I am still in treatment, will this harm me? These are MY conclusions and my decisions but the fact that I am doing something that can help me to win cancer is very important to me. My diet before cancer wasn´t very different from the one now (the hardest one is to cut with the cheese and reduce bread) so the \"sacrifice\" I have to do is a lot less than to other people.  In case of recurrence (hope not ) I prefer to be in a position where I can say \u201c I did all I could\u201d than wondering \u201cif I had all of this I could have avoid the recurrence?!\u201d  But probably is a trauma of being triple negative\u2026 In your case, act accordingly with your conscience and belifs, with no regrets, while still enjoying life in full J     ",

      "Content": "Hi Turbo, I had 4 EC+T every 3 weeks. My oncologist authorised to extend the period between my last EC and T by a week, which means that between the day I had my last EC and the day I had my first T passed 28 days. The doctors didn´t raise any issue with that but there were several health safety issues that I had to address as I suffered from very low white blood cells count: - I requested a declaration to the oncologist authorising me to fly. Ensure with them that you won't have any extra appointments or exams to do over the period you are abroad. - I had to carry with me filgrastim injections so I needed a declaration from the oncologist so I could carry them with me in the plain. I also contacted the flight company so I could put them in their fridge - I decided to fly in the days which my immune system was stronger: the day after chemo or from the 15-16th day after chemo. You need to check your own cycle and side effects pattern - you don´t wanna spend the entire flight vomiting... - I bought some masks to use at the airport and inside the plane. After investigating I bought these online as I wasn't happy with the ones sold at the pharmacies : Mask Pro3 (Pack10) FFP3 Masks CE Certified FFP3 Respirator Face Masks Valved Highest Graded - In Portugal I was staying at my mums place so I could control cleanliness and the environment surrounding me, inclusive the people who would be close to me ( it was winter and colds are very common in the north of portugal) - I searched for travel insurance but or they were to expensive or they wouldn´t cover private treatment. As I was staying with family and had my European Health insurance card ( I requested a new one online which came in less than a week) I decided not to subscribe the insurance but you need to look into your personal situation as you are going to stay in a hotel and most probably is worth to have one - but have the the European Health Insurance card as well. You need to look into your particular situation and make your own decisions. At the end I spent a lovely Christmas with my family with no health issues . I hope you can enjoy your holidays as much as I did mine. Paula",

      "Content": "Hi 4paws, About financial support, I was advised to call first Dilberby Cancer Care 02071885918 ( they actually have an office at Guy´s Hospital).  Unfortunately they have a big backlog so they forward me to Macmillan 08088080000. They were amazing. After the moment they create a registration with your name you can always come back to them for help. They also offer a small grant for people in need. Ask them for it to see if you are eligible. Prepare yourself. I never applied to benefits in my life and my process has been very hard on me. All the benefits process is very humiliating, they make you feel like you are begging. For a couple of times I just felt like telling them to stick all the bureaucracy and paperwork where the sun doesn´t shine. I applied in August and with all the errors that they have been made with my process I am still waiting for approval!!!   About infections please be careful. I was lucky. Although I was put in isolation for a week in an hospital room because my blood cells were very close to zero ( actually they hit zero 1 day!), receiving strong antibiotics through a canula, I didn´t have any infection. The detection was simple luck! I frequently go out for a 30 minutes walk and sometimes get home very very tired. I then measure my fever that can range from 37.5 to 38 - which is not normal. But I knew, at that time, that it was an abnormal reaction just to the walk. It would be impossible to catch an infection just for walking on my own!!! After a couple hours of resting, eating and drinking the fever would go down to normal. One day I decided to do some exercise at home and twisted my ankle. Went to the hospital to show it to the nurse and request advice for the treatment. In conversation I told her about my unusual spike fevers and she decided to do some blood counts on me. And that was how I found out about my big exposure to infections and how lucky I had been when I twisted my ankle lol. So please check constantly your fever and if something like this happens talk to your nurse. One week in the hospital as preventive measure is nothing compared with staying with infections with high fever for longer periods.  A very good advice that was given to me when I started my chemo: drink lots of water. I always try to drink between 2 to 3 litres a day and I think is helping a lot my side effects.  This process is a life changing process. Not having all the pieces of the puzzle is the worst thing we have to handle and learn how to manage so take one step at the time. Don´t stress: at the end the solution will come at the end of the tunnel :) Good luck with your treatment and any other information you need please feel free to ask. Paula",
