    "Content": "Hi Lisa Snap, i was diagnosed last thursday and i totaly understand how you feel, my son is 17 and took the news better than i expected, i have been as honest as i could and told him i would update him as they updated me. But i too have spent the weekend terrified, i had a biopsy yesterday and now have to wait until after the bank holiday to get results and find out what they can do. I am due back at work tomorrow but have no idea whether this will help or not, so i do sympathise with your situation. You havent let any one down, i lost my dad 29th nov 2013 and my partner walked out 3 weeks ago, you will be amazed at how strong your family will be for you. Take it easy, thinking of you. Liegh",
