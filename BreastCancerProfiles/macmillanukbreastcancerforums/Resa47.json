      "Content": "Hi figkip The waiting is awful isn\u2019t it?!!! My initial HER2 test came back borderline so I had to have another core biopsy done. They were only going to take 3 samples but I made them take 5 to be on the safe side.  I was due to have a lumpectomy and axillary node clearance but some minuscule calcified areas were found on one of my scans so they biopsied those too, luckily they were spotted by my eagled eyed consultant as they turned out to be precancerous. So my plan was changed so I\u2019d have chemo first, then the op and then radiation. I had my 2nd cycle of EC-T yesterday and my HER2 results came back yesterday too. I\u2019m HER2 negative. I asked my oncologist what that meant exactly and whether it would change my treatment plan and he said that the only difference it would make is that I won\u2019t be given Herceptin.  I hope you get your results soon  Resa47 xx",

      "Content": "I met this afternoon with my consultant and I have have my treatment plan. I was so worried that the cancer had spread but thank god it is contained in my left breast and nodes.  She will operate next week to remove the lump and auxiliary node clearance. 4 weeks later I\u2019ll have chemo and then rads. When I\u2019m all completely healed she will reconstruct my good Breast to look like the new improved cancer free one.  I know it\u2019s gonna be a long hard road but for the first time since I found my lump last month I feel positive.  Theresa",
