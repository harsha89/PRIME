    "Content": "Hi Tessa My mother has been having chemo for the past 5 months. She finds she is really tired after each session and usually has to be driven home as she falls asleep. That is the main reason for her not driving to and from appointments. Not sure what the general recommendation is, but I know in her case, that she could not possibly drive home afterwards. All the best for your first session. Lal",
