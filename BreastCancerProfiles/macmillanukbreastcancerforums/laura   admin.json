      "Content": "Hi Sophie,  Just to add to Kate's reply, someone from the team who puts that information together, Graham, has recently started a blog about travel insurance, right here on the Community.  He'll be posting monthly with up-to-date information as we hear it, but we're also hoping people from all over the Community will add to it, letting us know about companies who don't charge the earth for insurance when they hear the traveller has cancer. ",

      "Content": "Morning everyone, Hope you don't mind me butting in - I just wanted to say a massive thank you to all of you - for putting, on, going to and donating to Coffee Mornings. It means such a lot, and because of you we'll be able to carry on supporting as many people as we can affected by cancer. If you have any pics of your coffee mornings (or raffle winnings!) we'd love to see them, so do post them up if you get a chance. Laurax",
