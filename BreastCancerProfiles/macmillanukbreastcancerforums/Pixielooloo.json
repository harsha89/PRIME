      "Content": "Hi guys I have a couple of dilemmas. Firstly I wore the cold cap to my first chemo session and my hair around my hair line has now started to fall out, I had my hair cut short before treatment, i'm undecisive whether to leave it and see what happens and how much I actually lose or cut it really short!! I'm not ready to have the lot off, even though my scalp is very painful. Also my 2nd chemo session is Tuesday and i'm now not sure whether to bother with the cold cap. Any feedback would be much appreciated Many thanks",
