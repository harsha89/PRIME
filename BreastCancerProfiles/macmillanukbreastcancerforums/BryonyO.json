      "Content": "Hi Dotty25 The waiting is truly awful. I find it helps to be proactive. Chase this scan, speak to the department and ask when it is, tell them you\u2019ll take a cancellation. Phone regularly and politely ask. i usually apologise for inconveniencing them (Though it is their job. I\u2019m just trying to win them over ).  When the scan happens, ask how long it takes for reports to be done. Technicians  aren\u2019t allowed to tell you what they see (for good reasons). So don\u2019t ask them that, just ask about timing. Tell them you\u2019re worried.  Make sure your appointment for results, ties up with s soon as the report will be available. If it\u2019s a week later, then call and get it moved. If the appointment department won\u2019t move it then call hospital and ask for secretary of your oncologist, get them to move it.  You cant change what\u2019s happened already, but you can be proactive from now on. You can take control and decide that you\u2019ll do your best to never let anyone dismiss your concerns again.  For now I\u2019d look out the phone numbers ready to make the calls on a Tuesday morning, msybevareange for someone to come round to help with your baby so you aren\u2019t called awaycwhen you make the call. It may take a few phone calls asking for numbers to get through to where you want. If you get someone unhelpful, then try phoning a different number. Keep a note of all numbers in case you need them another time. Note names of people you speak to.  Once you\u2019ve got this ready, then try to put it to one side and enjoy every moment with your precious  child. You May find it easier once you\u2019ve s plan Try and have a Happy Easter ",

      "Content": "Hi Jo My partner also had a rough time with FEC-T and I'm sure your stairs experience was very disturbing indeed.   You mentioned that the steroids were affecting your sleep, can I double check when you are taking them? We've been advised not to take the decsamethasone after 2pm because of the stimulation side effect but atbthe moment she's taking a low dose to address inflammation (so it's just one dose a day) and takes it at 9.30am so it doesn't mess with her sleep at all.  We found our local hospice were the best with side effect management. You might find it all more bearable with more support.  I hope you find the strength to have another dose of FEC but it's your body and you need to do what feels right for you. Talk to your Oncologist and see what they suggest.  Good luck.  Bryony Carer to partner with Secondary Breast Cancer. ",

      "Content": "Jo666 Thanks Kacang and Bryony. I'm taking 16mg of dexamethasone the day before, 8 on the day as the hospital give me steroids through the drip and another day of steroids the day after. I take them at 8 am and 3 pm. Haven't had an accident yet but I had to rush home from Asda and only just made the toilet. During that time as soon as I eat I get stomach pains and I'm on the toilet within the hour. I'll be glad when all this is over. Jo x Can I suggest speaking to your Oncologist about timing of steroids. Taking the second one so late in the day as 3pm is possibly what effecting your sleep. My partner was advised by both the nurses in the treatment room and the hospice specialist nurse that the second dose should be taken before 2pm as it would interrupt sleep. I assume it's common to have doses at the level you take as mynosrtner was given the same for those few days around the intravenous chemo too, though with her last typebof intravenois  chemo she only took the hospital based ones and declined the ones to take home because of side effects.  Please get some advice because you need to learn how to manage symptoms. We have laxative and anti diarrhoea meds in the house. Hopefully your experience will be different to ours as my partner has spent five years going from one treatment to the next. Even if you are fortunate and you don't have surgery and/or radiotherapy to follow, it will still be helpful to know what you can do to help with any symptoms, as it will take a few weeks to recover from the chemo.  Good luck and please keep sharing. You aren't alone.  Bryony xx",

      "Content": "Jo666 Thanks for your advice Bryony. I have my blood test tomorrow so I will see what they say at the hospital. One thing is for certain is that I need to be fit for my radiotherapy planning session 7 days after my chemo which involves a train and a bit of a walk. I will keep you informed what happens and plan to stay on this friendly forum. Jo x Hi Jo Please do keep posting. Your journey won't be easy but hopefully it will be a little easier for sharing.  My partner's first radiotherapy (to chest after mastectomy) was 15 days over three weeks. It was an hour away and she drive done days and other people drove on others. It was exhausting mainly because of that journey so, what you said about the train and walk makes sense. Thinking about the impact of that. On top of chemo is tough. If you've anyone who's offered to help, see if any of them can drive you. Even if it is just one day, especially at the end of the week. We have friends who run their own businesses and others who work shifts, so a couple of them helped out. It was only two days out of the fifteen but it did help.  I shall look out for your next post.  Take care Bryony",

      "Content": "HI There are many options, but one thought I have is that your next appointment is on a Monday, so clearly your consultant has a clinic on a Monday. Why not go tomorrow and see your consultant and discuss the issue with them. If your results aren't available then, you can just keep your other appointment the following week. When my partner had issues, I would call the department and tell the receptionist that there were worrying side effects and ask if she could be seen. On occasions, the consultant would phone us instead of taking up an appointment slot, but I know not everyone has such a decent consultant. If you don't have the number for the clinic (get it next time you are there, if they have someone who sits their regularly, we found it helpful to get on first name terms with that person), then call the hospital and ask to speak to the consultant's secretary. You might find it useful not to go into details over the phone, just saying it is worrying you and you were told to let them know if there were issues. Mention that you have never called in before, it lets them know you aren't always calling. I suspect there is a simple fix to this, and that it is not a serious issue. It seems that your bowel has become irritated and fibre is an issue, you might find taking some acidophilus (friendly bacteria fro the gut, you can get small amounts in those yoghurt drinks etc, but I'd just get tablets from a health food shop). However these things can spiral and FEC-T is a harsh chemical. My Mother-in-Law had a different cancer/treatment, had ascites drained so that could have caused it and also had previous bowel surgery, so had a weakness there) but died following chemo which was said lead to a burst bowel. I am not saying this to scare you as I don't think this will be your issue at all, but if you think your hospital won't take you seriously, implying your symptoms could be something more serious, could mean you get to speak with your own consultant sooner and possibly even get results sooner, which might be useful too but will mean you get to speak with a specialist rather than relying on us well meaning folks here. I hope your tum feels better soon and the scan results are as positive as they can be.",
