      "Content": "Hello and wishing you and your loved ones all good health! Please excuse my ignorance in this post but we are confused and would like some advice!  I am here because my father was diagnosed with Male Breast Cancer (stage 3 invasive, triple negative- 38/44 infected lymph nodes) back in September. He had the mass removed. He began his chemo treatment in the first week of Jan - FEC-T- 6 sessions every 3 weeks. Unfortunately the poor guy reacted badly a couple of times, so ended up in isolation at the hospital because of dangerously low White blood count and sepsis. As a result they have now changed his chemo to weekly at a milder dose. He finishes up this week. He begins his radiotherapy next week. This will last a week.  We met with the consultant on Friday for a catch up and asked him what will happen after the radiotherapy. He simply said \"we will them review you in 3 months and see how you got on with everything\".  My question is- is that it??? How do they know the treatment worked?? Surely they do scans afterwards to see the position of the cancer? Is he in remission? Did it even work slightly? Has it grown?  Why do they wait 3 months? Isn't that leaving it a long time, it could grow in that time too especially if the chemo wasn't a success.  Please could someone tell me what happens now? Our key worker never gets back to us. We don't know what to expect. It seems like we are being let out into the world again without any idea of the position of the cancer. Its terribly scary.  Thank you. ",

      "Content": "Hi all! So my 68 year old father in law (fil) was diagnosed with secondary cancer of the left axillary a few months back. There has been lots of to-ing and fro-ing as they couldn't figure where the primary origin was. Firstly he was told primary was in the stomach but they've now said it originated from the breast itself. It's signet cell in nature (rare and aggressive). He has had 2 operations so far to remove the mass.  What we know so far is that it's : stage 3 secondary , 38/44 nodes cancerous, grade 3 - ER PR HER2 Negative.  He has been told it can be cured , with a 55-60 percent survival prognosis.  He starts 6 rounds of chemo next week- FEC-T. He won't be given any hormone therapy as he is triple negative. After this, he will begin radiotherapy.  But we are clueless as they don't seem very convinced with what is going on themselves! They said \"for the time being we are treating this as breast cancer\", but signet cell itself is more often than not associated to the gastric region. They just don't seem to want to investigate the gastric and colon region as previous endoscopy was clear (despite the nurse recommending that it be repeated because of a few suspect areas). Just looking for someone/anyone who has any understanding of male breast cancer to offer me some advice or share their story. From what I've read up on, his prognosis seems quite dismal! Mil is falling apart at the seams from the stress of not really having any direction after 2 months of being told \"we don't know what it is\". Fil is being positive though, he is a great spirit! ",
