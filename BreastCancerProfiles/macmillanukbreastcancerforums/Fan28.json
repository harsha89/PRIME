    "Content": "Hello Twinkle79 Please see your GP. I found a painful lump and a indent around the lump on my upper breast. It was clear to see the lump through the skin. My shoulder and arm hurt too.  Terrified I went to the GP who found another 1cm lump and was referred to my local breast clinic. After a nightmare 2 week wait and convinced of the worse, the doctor found the lump and could see the indentation but thought it was just dense breast tissue. He also found the 1cm lump. A mammogram and scan confirmed all were normal breast tissue and no signs of cancer or tumours. The staff were amazing, understanding and professional.  I had lost a stone in weight and this caused the lumps to be visible and indentations, I had also pulled a muscle in my chest which was causing the pain.  I\u2019m so glad that I went to my GP because I was worrying myself stupid. It is not always bad news even though all my symptoms pointed most likely to a cancer tumor. ",
