    "Content": "Hi Caz and everyone.    I, too have a problem with my arm, I even had my 3rd lot of chemo delayed a week while i was on a hefty dose of antibiotics for cellulitis in it. . It is still a bit tender and lumpy and my GP said yesterday it looks blocked to him! I am desperate not to have next Tuesdays chemo put back again, it might only be a week, but you all know what I mean? Just get it over with!!  I'm halfway through, then Radiotherapy.  Anyway, i was wondering if any of you ladies get the same side effect as me, cos I'm sick of it, 2 weeks after chemo ( when I'm starting to feel good again) I get cold and shivery and at the same time run a temperature! My oncology nurse has got me to go to my GP each time for bloods, as my white cells drop so low, but this means I spend a lot of time in fear I will be told to get myself into Hospital for IV antibiotics! I get moody, and snap at my husband, and when it happened yesterday ( he was spending more time looking up spare bits for the new caravan than asking if I was OK, or anything!) he eventually cleared off to bed at 8 pm, leaving me to see if out of hours Docs would ring me like they had before when my bloods weren't good!  Am I being unreasonable about him? Perhaps I am being a bit \"me, me, me\", but a few kind words and a hug would have been enough. I always knew he wasn't the most patient sort of man, but at times like last night I felt he was one of the most selfish men ever!! How about you ladies? Anyone finding similar, or have you all got the sort of man I sometimes wish I had?? I did get a cup of tea in bed this morning, with the comment \"hope you feel better this morning\"  And they say romance is dead!. xxx",
