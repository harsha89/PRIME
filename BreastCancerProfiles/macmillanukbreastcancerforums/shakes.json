    "Content": "My partner was put on tamoxifen after finishing her radiotherapy and since all of this is now terrified of going to a doctor. We are getting there but I'm worried that the tamoxifen is causing the side effects she is suffering and just wanted to know if anyone could tell me if they are \"normal\" or if I need more help encouraging her to see a doctor urgently. She is only being able to sleep for small amounts of time like 2 hours through each night and is then exhausted, but what concerns me most is that she describes her head feeling as though it's hot inside like filled with a hot liquid? This comes in waves and at first I thought it was hot flushes but I can't find any accounts of people explaining them like this. I have enquired into herbal help but have been told she can't have anything like red clover as will contract the tamoxifen. Just slightly lost and hoping someone can tell me how concerned to be as my mind is racing, thanks for just reading this far.",
