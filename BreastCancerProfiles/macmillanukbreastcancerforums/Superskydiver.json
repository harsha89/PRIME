      "Content": "Hi  I had my left breast removed four weeks ago and had a reconstruction with an expander implant. I had my drains for 3 weeks. My breast is so sore and and hoping that it goes down in size as it feels hard and goes very tight. Is this normal, I told a different consultant who didn\u2019t seemed worried. I\u2019m frustrated as I\u2019m such an active person working outside doing manual work. How long till I can at least drive??? Would love to hear from others xx",

      "Content": "Hi there  4 weeks ago I had a cyst removed that had cancer cells in it.  My breast is still very painful and feels like it's on fire sometimes, I'm due to see my consultant in a few days but just wondered if this was normal, I'm so uncomfortable and can't return to work and I'm conscious about money I'm not being in. Thanks ",
