      "Content": "Hello AnneH Thanks for your reply. I rang Zentiva this morning and was told that they have discontinued their Anastrozole so I am going to have to try another brand soon.  Your comments about aches and pains also helped as I am getting the same symptoms and thought it was because I am getting older, but maybe it is the tablets.   I have just had a call from Boots saying that they have managed to find the brand I am happy with and have ordered 6 packs, which \"IF\" they are the right ones will last me a while.  Knowing that someone else has had the same problems has helped. Thank you",

      "Content": "Hello I have been taking Anastrozole by Zentiva for 5 years now and have just been told by Boots, Paydens and Clockwork pharmacies that they are unable to get it. I have stuck to this brand as I have not had any side effects from the extra ingredients.  The extra ingredients in tablets I have taken in the past have caused stomach problems. Can anyone suggest an alternative brand that doesn't have lots of extra ingredients. Celia",

      "Content": "Hello Joyce Thanks for your reply.  I had to do something similar in the past at Boots to get them to get the brand I wanted.  Last Friday I gave Boots Zentivas telephone number and asked them to ring them direct. This morning I had a call from Boots saying that they have managed to find the brand I am happy with and have ordered 6 packs, which \"IF\" they are the right ones will last me a while.  I also rang Zentiva this morning and they told me they have discontinued their Anastrozole so I am going to have to try another brand in the future and hope I can find one that that doesn't have unexpected side effects. Thank you   Celia",
