    "Content": "Hi all, A bit of advice if I may, on the early side effects of tamoxifen.. So I've been on the meds for just over a week now after having seen oncologist last week and I'm getting awful headaches and am a complete emotional wreck! Literally can't stop my eyes from leaking! I can't honestly say I'm 'depressed' as I feel ok in myself, but it's really quite annoying when at work and I start welling up very nothing! Anyone had the same? Any help/advice greatfully recieved",
