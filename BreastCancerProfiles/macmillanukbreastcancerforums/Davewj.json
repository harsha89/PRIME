      "Content": "Hi everyone I am a 73 year old male dignosed with breast cancer July 2017, I had a mastectomy and lymph node removal August 2017 followed by radiotherapy in November 2017 I then started on Tamoxifen. I seem to read a lot about long term use of Tamoxifen and depression is depression a normal side effect or am I reading something into this. The only side effect that I have noticed so far is chronic skin itching does anybody know if this is the norm in men or is there anything I can do to relieve this. Cheers in advance Dave",
