I was diagnosed in July and had snb followed by left mx , node clearance (it was in 5 nodes) and ld flap recon but no implant yet until treatments are finished. I find it really hard to cope with the emotional side and all those tears. I've never been a tearful person and my hubby doesn't know what to do. You def find out who your friends are. I have found a couple of real friends from acquaintances and been surprised about some ppl I thought were good friends who seem completely distant. I am sick of bein told to stay positive, that I have to fight it, that I don't look as bad as expected etc. I am just trying to get through it all physically and keep believing that I will recover and it won't come back! Having a smile face and being jolly is a step too far sometimes. Nobody gets the fear unless they've been there. This forum is a lifeline of people who completely get I and just try to help and support. you have had so much more than I have had to cope with and you seem an amazing lady. We all have the right to feel how we feel as it's mostly outside of our control. There are people here that will give you great support. Sending you a big hug xxx",

      "Content": "Hi Dawn I also had grade 1 tumours but had a biopsy ahead of my mastectomy on the 3rd Sept. I was advised that they would expect the nodes to be clear so I am keeping my fingers crossed for you. I was told that the risk of lymphoedema was low but I have been careful and seem ok. I had to have full clearance because there was tumour and traces in some of the nodes to am now being extra careful. As this is unusual I will be having radiotherapy and we are discussing whether to have chemo with the oncologist. My understanding is that they only take the nodes that react so that is probably why your surgeon took just one. I'm sure George's link will tell you more. You do not sound pathetic! I felt that it was just a barrage of information, appointments and procedures that just kept coming. You only had your op yesterday so will be feeling sorry for yourself. I am a big wimp and have been surprised by how I've coped with things. People say you just deal with things as they arise and they are right. Just look after yourself, cry, rant or do whatever you need to do. If i'm having a bad day i just accept it and know that the next day will be better. Sending best wishes and hugs xx",

The Onc said that it was not unusual and that going to hospital daily is draining plus the travelling and I had early starts for 8am appointments. I came home and put my feet up every day, schlepped on the sofa and rested. You need to be kind to yourself as your bodies under a lot of strain and needs its energy to heal. Apply the aqueous cream 4 times a day to help with the skin quality and internal scar tissue and keep it in the fridge so it's really soothing. I also got some weird internal itching and took Piriton which worked fine, as recommended by the radiotherapist. You'll get there! Good luck xx",

I had my node biopsy 2 weeks before so know what the pain from that (as apart from the mx pain) and I swear the clearance was worse in the early days. The other Angie is right to mention cording. Mine came on in November but gas all cleared with help from my physio. Speak to your bcn and ask to be referred for physio. It really helps bug the NHS seem to try to save on this area of treatment. I was told to stand facing the wall then walk my fingers up until it was twingeing, hold for 5 then walk them back down. Do this about 6 times but don't push yourself to make it hurt. Do the same sideways to get the arm moving. I have other exercises I can explain if useful. It does take time but you'll get there. Take care of you xx",

They couldn't save my nipple which also bothered me (almost as much as losing the boob) but it looks ok and I'm getting used to it. Misty Moley who posted earlier has a you tube vid of the 3d tattoo which I found helpful and may reassure you wife about options if it can't be retained. Funny the things that hit us hardest. I was all about the op and recovery and underestimated the emotional impact of this. I tried to keep it together for my hubby but it all comes out eventually. Just give her lots of hugs and reassurance. I was quite perky post op but really down a couple of days later which is a really common side affect of the anasthaetic so be prepared. Best advice I had from a friend who's wife had bc was some days are sh*t, just accept it! scream, cry or hide under the duvet and know that tomorrow will be better. He was spot on and it has helped me cope. This is a real roller coaster but somehow we all manage it. Word of advice, see if someone can sort out food for you. My poor hubby was working, hospital visiting and updating everyone then getting his meals. He looked worse than me when I came home! Lots of support is great but sometimes people like to be asked to do specific things to help. Also see if you can get a heart shaped cushion. It's the perfect shape to fit under the arm and helps you get comfy after the node clearance, specially in bed. If not that shape any soft smallish cushion will help. Hugs to you both and best wishes for Tuesday xxx",

We all know exactly how you feel because we've all been there and that's really helpful. I was diagnosed in July which seems a lifetime ago and had mastectomy (mx), node clearance and ld flap recon on 3rd Sept. I take tamoxifen and start radiotherapy next Wednesday but didn't have chemo so feel free to contact me if I can help. I think that you are at the worst time. You're reeling from the shock news and waiting for results but don't know the treatment plan. It feels so out of control at first with endless appointments but you just need to go with it. It sound like you have good medical facilities and support but your sense if humour will be a huge asset. No, it doesn't always hold up but if you have a bad day just remember that tomorrow will be better. It is an emotional roller coaster but you will get through and we are all here to help.

Flashbacks, body image issues that weren't there post-op (I was really pleased with the recon having been told it might be very small) and generally fed up and tearful. It's like finally I have to come to terms with everything that happened in such. A rush last year. I swear if one more person tells me to be positive I'll slap them.

      "Content": "Hi Mudge Like Dorothee I've posted on this before so apologies to those who've seen it before. I had left mx, ANC and ld flap recon in September ANC like you was exodus ting to have just rads so I know how you feel with the chemo bombshell. However, in my case the node involvement meant that my Predict results were between 80-86%. I was lucky to bad able to have an oncotype DX test. This is the test recently approved for the NHS if there is no lymph issues and gives you a prediction of the likelihood of cancer recurrence and the benefit of chemo based on your actual tumours rather than a sample. In my case this said that the recurrence risk was low and that because the tumour was slow growing, chemo would probably be of limited benefit. Based on these results I opted for no chemo but have had rads and tamoxifen. My husband and oncologist have supported this and we would have had long discussions if the risk score had been higher. I was certain that the potential side effects and the extended treatment time might be offset by no real benefit but I am very analytical and this is not an exact science. My onc's assistant find say that they tend to default to giving chemo because that was the norm. You may be able to arrange for the oncotype test to give you more info. Some people decide to throw everything at this and some limit what they will do. It's a personal choice and no one way is right. A friend of mind requested a second opinion when told no chemo was necessary just to put her mind to rest. Could you do that? Hope this helps. X",

I had a left mastectomy because the tumours were too close to the nipple and the location would have left a very deformed breast. I had an ld flap reconstruction (where they use back muscle to make a new breast) at the same time and am very impressed with the results. My left boob was always a cup size smaller than the right so it doesn't look too odd to me as it still is, although a little smaller. I am a dd/e cup which made recon more challenging. At the start I was desperate to have recon and look \"normal\" and my surgeon was happy to do this while it was medically sensible but lymph node involvement meant that she couldn't add an implant as I need radiotherapy (rads). Even without it looks ok. This is the scariest thing I've ever been through but your health has to be the primary focus. I would be guided by your surgeon but if you feel strongly about reconstruction as I did make sure that they know. My team have been great at taking my wishes into consideration when recommending treatment. Lots of people will tell you that you will come through this and cope. They are right. Somehow we all find the strength to deal with this roller coaster although it doesn't always feel like it. I am sending you a big hug and wishing you all the best for your appointment. Xx",

A Breast cancer diagnosis is covered by the disability legislation and therefore your employer needs to agree a staged return to work plan.

I have to manage on SSP until I am fit to return to work so completely understand the financial implications of this illness.

I work for a very small business which can't afford to pay long term sick leave but from very soon after my diagnosis my MD (based on external HR advice) said that I am entitled to Stat sick pay (28 weeks I think) and that we need to agree a \"return to work plan\" which is currently based on 1 day per week for a couple of weeks gradually increasing to full time. She has been really great and had based this on the government guidelines etc. I also thought that your GP can issue a certificate that says that you are fit for work on certain conditions I.e. limited hours so it may ask be worth talking to them. It sounds like you work for a larger organisation so they will understand the risks of to following the rules. I hope that this helps you and Jackie. I send you both best wishes and hugs xx",

      "Content": "Hi Steve I'm also not medical but did opt not to have chemo. I had two grade 1 tumours and had a mastectomy in September but was lucky that my clinic is part of a trial so I was offered an oncotype test despite having tumours in the lymph nodes . This confirmed that the tumours are slow growing and that because the chemo kills cells that are actively dividing there would be less benefit for me. My understanding is that it attacks any cell that is dividing when the drugs are given hence the impact on good cells but any stray cancer cells might be inactive at that time and therefore not affected. I am having radiotherapy though as my oncologist described this as smart in that it is aimed at the area where the cancer was. It is a very hard decision but I felt that the negatives were not outweighed by the possible benefits. Very best wishes to you both and I hope that your wife is soon feeling better. How lovely that you care enough to post here :) Good luck!",

I know that's not for everyone and my GP doesn't hand them out line sweets but you do need to get a break sometime! Definitely speak to Macmillan about benefits or look to send if you have a local cancer centre or hospice as they usually have an advisor who can help. I'm getting some advice as I am coming to the end of SSP and have no idea what happens next. I don't get laid sick leave either and never expected to be if for 6 months. Do not let your employer pressure you back to work too soon. You are covered by the disability act and they have to help you. My GP is refusing to sign mad back for more than 1 day a week and only on a month by month basis so that she can manage my \"back to work\" plan and friends who've been there have warned me not tk rush things even if it's financially hard. I don't have children (that must be hard to deal with) bug do have a husband who has been amazing. You really find out who your friends are and there will probably be done surprises but let them help . Not sure why they think you're lucky... there's nothing good about having cancer! I'm not a group person either but have found great support and advice on this site and reluctantly joined a local hospice group which has proved to be brilliant and I have made a couple of good friends there. Take each day as it comes. You will have good days and bad days. Just roll with the bad ones and know that the next day will be better. It's a roller coaster emotionally which you can't prepare for but you can make practical preparations. I hog some good button front nightshirts and loose shirts for post op from Primark and m&s do decent support bras and the most comfy vests. Rant all you like to us. We all know how you feel. Sending you a big hug. Take care of you xxx",

      "Content": "Hi Kay. I had 5 weeks of rads and found the tiredness kicked in within the first week. I also had lumpy areas that hurt to touch and throbbed and the radiographer arranged for me to see the oncologist in charge of rads (clinical oncologist I think they're called). He said it was completely normal but to request a further appointment with him if I was worried. By week 4 I had a lot of pain and my skin was very sore but nobody was concerned and my GP told me to take cocodamol rather than paracetamol. I've still got pain now, about 6 weeks since finishing but still it's been checked and declared normal. My GP said that I've just been unfortunate in having a bad time with rads. I kept my aqueous cream in the fridge and applied it 3 to 4 times a day. My bcn also suggested putting a wet flannel in the fridge and laying it on the boob to take the heat out. I gave up with bras (I still find them uncomfortable) and have worn m&s basic vests which have very low seams so don't rub and they wash/dry in no time. My skin was close to breaking but never did on this regime. I would ask to see the oncologist to have it checked and put your mind to rest. Most people seem to cope well with rads but some of us react more and quicker. Sending you a very gentle hug xxx",

      "Content": "Hi. You need to get advice from a professional. I used to run but my physio and surgeon have both told me not to start back yet because of impact (I had ld flap recon, mx and clearance in Sept 2013). One of our local hospices had an adapted gym for cancer patients and you can be referred there by the physio or GP. The hospice that I go to is running adapted tai chi and yoga classes which are great. Hospice is a scary word but I am not terminal and didn't realise that they offered these services to those of us recovering! I have been told that lower body work is fine - walking, cycling and other machines as well as lower body weights equipment. My physio showed me how to do a Pilates sit up and I understand that Pilates and yoga are ok. The golden rule is that if it hurts, stop. I had rads and am on tamoxifen and just stop if I feel tired before I planned to stop. I think kettle bells may be a bit ambitious! Word of warning to Virgin Active members, I've been a member for over 9 years. They gave put up signs asking to be informed if there are changes to your medical condition. When I spoke to the staff I had a form to fill in but as soon as you answer \"yes\" to a question or enter any details they insist on a medical letter to say you are fit to exercise. I explained that I am not working /earning and that I couldn't afford to pay for a doctors letter and we are still discussing. I am furious! I have paid a fortune in membership and training and we have struggled to keep up our membership so that I could use the gym as part of my rehab. Seriously thinking of cancelling. My GP said she has endless requests for such letters from corporates trying to cover their butts and it's a complete waste of time. Sorry, rant over. I hope the info I've been given is helpful. Your bcn should be able to point you in the right direction for local services. Best wishes xx",

I kind of resent that some of the things that are part of the build up for me (going into London Xmas shopping and listening to the carols from Kings college while making mince pies) just couldn't be managed either physically or emotionally. New year was even worse. Had to go to a fancy dress night in my in laws village. Just wanted to stay home not face people asking how I was doing was topped by someone trying to drag me out to dance arms linked round the clock tower then when I explained I'd had mx said she volunteered at the hospice and would look after me. Seriously, if I'd wanted to go outside I would have been with my family so I ended up in tears which was just what I was trying to avoid. Sorry for the rant. I have a wonderful husband and family who have been brilliant through this all but please, don't ask me to be uber happy and cheerful just at the moment.

I also work in a small company and we are fighting to survive (i'm on SSP so also worried about money) so I understand your concern for your colleagues. I hope that they are like mine and 100% behind you and willing to cover for you to get better. I've been told of people who worked through chemo, rads etc, but my GP said that as a rule she believes that you should be signed off so that you can focus on getting better and reduce exposure to bugs etc. Breast cancer is covered by the disability legislation so companies have to give you the time off and protect your position. I know it's really hard when you are a loyal member of a team but you and your hubby are the most important thing now. I have had weekly chats with my boss and a couple of calls with the team. I've also said that unofficially I'm happy to help with odd things unless I'm really suffering. My boss really appreciated that offer and said that her business concerns would be mistakes because I'm not up to par and finding things that can can dip in and out of. It may be easier for your company to get some additional resource for the next few months than trying to work around inevitable absences. I'm sort of glad to be signed off as I don't have to worry about taking time for the various appointments and if I break down in tears only the dogs see - I'd be mortified if it was in front of colleagues or clients. This is a big thing both medically and emotionally and you are also worrying about and caring for your husband! A friend whose wife had bc told me that this puts work into perspective (I was a workaholic) and to speak to Macmillan or the local council about in avail entitlements. I wish I could just give you a big hug. Nothing worse than those days when the black fog descends but remember there'll be sunshine tomorrow. Happy to chat direct xxx",

I had sentinel node biopsy 20/8 and laft mastectomy, node clearance and ld flap recon on 3/9. It is hormone receptive and as 5 of the 24 lymph nodes had either tumour or traces I have been advised to have rads and tamoxifen. However, the need for chemo is not clear. In theory I am low risk and have major issues with chemo. I see it as non-targeted, brutal treatment which may not significantly improve my prognosis (I would have 6 cycles of FEC). My onc was honest that the treatment is tough but I am still feeling rough from all the surgery without launching into months of being poorly. I am really lucky that I have been offered the chance for a US test to assess the likelihood of recurrence but will need to wait 2 weeks for the results. Can anyone who has had FEC treatment give me any advice re the treatment and the risks of refusing chemo?",

The only ones that didn't hurt me were a 34c where I'm a 32e on my remaining boob. I just used the filler to boost Leftie. I didn't have an implant though. I went to Rigby and Peller ((thank you hubby xx) and they fitted me with bras with wider straps and a bit of a band underneath which has finally meant I can wear a bra! You won't want to spend much if you're still \"expanding\" but if they have a branch near you I'm sure they could advise or contact your nearest john Lewis and ask to see someone who understands breast reconstruction in lingerie.

I go to the local hospice who provide day support groups, advice, exercise and relaxation and a drop in service. I had no idea that they provided anything but palliative care for terminal patients. My day hospice means that I see a nurse every week and a chance to drop the facade for a few hours as we all know what it's like. Yes there are tears but I've also met some really nice people and we have a good laugh too. There's another service at the hospital where I had my rads so you may find a support group at your local cancer centre. Xxx",

That may be shallow and vain but the consultant said that there a psychological benefits to recon with mx and it usually reduces the number of ops even if it makes this one longer. A lot of my pain is from the lymph clearance as it damages so many nerve endings and the rads have caused some internal upset to the recon but this should resolve eventually. I've had little pain in my back ! Mistymoley has had great success with implants and a 3d nipple tattoo which she's written some great posts about. We all just want to feel better and recon is part of that for some but not all. My surgeon pushed for LD flap but it may be her speciality. She did a darned good job. Can you ask to speak to a second surgeon? LD worked for me but I freaked about the port for increasing the implant. At the time I freaked about pretty much everything! I think there are pros and cons with all and it takes time for things to settle. Let us know if you have any questions that we can answer. Big hug!",

      "Content": "Hi Tracey Glad your appointment went well. I saw my Onc this week too. I have some fluid above the recon and pain in the recon which is being put down to radiotherapy but have been told that it will all gradually settle down. I saw a doc at our local hospice and she said to try up to 8 paracetamol and 6 ibuprofen per day as the ibuprofen helps with inflammation including that in the nerve sheaths which with the nerve endings get damaged during surgery but do heal. I believe nerves repair at a rate of 1 mm per week so slow progress. If this regime doesn't work then amitriptyline is usually effective. Since you're going away soon it seems sensible to try this sooner. I hope your GP has sorted this for you. I also asked why they don't say how long it really takes to recover and she said that the surgeons are very focused on the surgical wounds which are pretty much healed within a couple of months. The nerve damage and emotional side takes much longer and not really something the surgical team are involved with. My surgeon said about a year for the back numbness to subside but that this may never fully clear. Keep doing your physio as you can get muscle tightness and potentially cording later than I thought. By gently stretching the muscles it will settle down quicker but no strengthening exercises for a while yet as this will bulk and tighten the muscles. Do you have a Breast care nurse? They can really help. I know what you mean about implants but my surgeon us adamant that the flap recons give a more natural result. Well done doing the race for life! Have a great holiday and I wish you well xx",

I was told that i would be ok to fly 7 hrs after 8 weeks but don't think I could have coped. I still have the \"rolled up newspaper\" feeling under my arm but that is partly from the clearance ANC I'm not sure if you had that too. I remember at 8 weeks feeling pretty fragile and I'm still tearful now. My back is still very numb, feels a bit like a shell, but I didn't have extreme swelling. I did get some fluid but was advised to keg it reabsorb naturally if poss as it can recur if aspirated. I had a range of pillows and cushions to egg myself comfy. You have been through a massive shock with diagnosis followed by major surgery and you need to give your body time to heal. We girls play down what's happening hug you need to take it slowly. George ANC Jackie are right, you need to see your bcn, GP or consultant and get them to check. I says my bcn a couple of times to monitor but had to call each time, no planned appointments. I was told that it takes about a year for the recon and back to finally settle so if you're impatient like me, we're going to have to take it easy. We're off on a 4 hr flight next month and I've been advised to take aspirin before flying, wear flight socks and get up and walk around as often as possible. Sending you a big but gentle hug.

      "Content": "Hi Sharon.. I had ld flap recon at the same time as my mx and clearance in September. My surgeon was concerned that she would not get a good result because I didn't have enough back fat but was also convinced that the DIEP would be problematic as not enough there either. I was stunned as I'm a normal size 10-12. I drew the line at them using tissue from my bum! I was set on implants at first as it was the shortest op but my surgeon said it would not look natural on me (Lefty was 32dd and his remaining pal is a 32e) and always favoured flap recon as they use mostly your own tissue . My oncologist asked her not to put a small implant in to balance because I would need rads. I am smaller on the left but I can live with it. She has said that they can look at an implant once the rads reaction internally has settled and can do a reduction and lift on Righty to even them up. She has also mentioned nipple recon but I'm thinking I may opt for the 3d tattoo as described by Mistymoley. The ld flap is quite an op but I am really delighted with the results so far. It's taken me longer to recover than I thought but I had node biopsy op 2 weeks before then the full surgery so it was a lot of surgery in a short space of time. I have had no infection or rejection issues and actually it's the clearance that's been most painful. Loved Rebecca's post about the things people say! My nicest was the nurse at my GP who asked me last week which arm she could use for a blood test because she had looked but couldn't tell which side was the recon. Just the little boost I needed. Also my rads Onc who called my surgeon to discuss treatment as it was such an amazing recon he didn't want to damage it. I hope that helps. Good luck!",

My husband and I had a near split two years almost to the day I was diagnosed but we stayed together and he has been amazing. I do believe that things happen for a reason... we didn't split and I can't imagine coping with this on my own, I've realised how much I still love him, I've discovered a couple of new friends, I've realised what's important to me, our planned house move fell through last January but the care and treatment where I live has been much better than if we'd moved etc, etc. If your bf couldn't support you through this then he doesn't deserve you. Bad enough to walk away but to cheat on you really shows his mettle and you've probably had a lucky escape. I know it won't feel like it now but you will find the right person who deserves you. I am still crying and I haven't had the emotional upset you've had! I had mx in September with immediate ld flap recon. Because I've needed rads I couldn't have the implant but we've both been amazed by what my surgeon has achieved. I was a 32 dd before (32e on my remaining boob) and even without the implant I look pretty balanced in clothes. It's incredible what they can do and once you have your recon you'll feel happier about how you look. What goes around comes around so he'll get his payback. Just remember, you have a normal body, it's just a bit battle scarred at the moment. Beauty is you and how you treat people not how you look. Sending you a big hug. Xx",

I was advised to check anything new that I bought to make sure I had no allergic reaction just to be safe. I've done this on the wrist of my good arm and have been using the aloe deodorant which I've found good. Before my first op my work colleagues made a basket of treats and essentials. One little thing that was brill was a lip salve.

You are invited to go along (you only go once) but mine fell about 4 weeks post op. really useful but would have been nice to know some in advance. I found out that the hospice by the hospital, there a 3 different ones near me, is actually a day hospice and rather than focussing on end of life care has alternative therapists, advisors etc aimed at people who are going through treatment. They also have a course on life after treatment that is highly recommended. I had no idea that anyone did this as the other two hospices are very much for terminal patients. I didn't even realise this from the hospice website. There seems to be a lot of help out there if you look but by the time you feel like doing the research you probably don't need it. Everyone raves about the support line here and they were lovely when my mum called to talk and find out more. Will be my first port of call for general things. I think that the NHS has huge demands and different priorities across the uk and charities also can only cover certain areas or regions.

My cousin who went through thus last year supported me based on her experience and regardless of my results. We are all different and must make our own choices. One thing I would recommend is that my mum-in-law made me a lovely heart shaped pillow which I have slept with since my mx, ANC and recon op. It had been brill at easing the discomfort and been a bit like my childhood bear by wag of a comforter. I wish you all the very best not least for standing up for your own way of getting through this. xxxx",

It's designed for people with cancer so I'm lucky to be on it. I used to run and do weights but haven't been able to since my op last September. Saw my surgeon a couple of weeks ago and asked about running and was told just to walk even on a treadmill but I had ld flap recon and I think it's about the impact. My physio showed me a Pilates sit up so I assume that Pilates may be an option. Her golden rule is no weights and stop before something hurts. I was warned that pushing myself would cause more problems and I also started cording after 4 months. For me it's all about gently stretching the muscles rather than building them. I am feeling so unfit from sitting around for months but start slow and build up seems to be the message. Good luck!",

I asked a couple of friends at my support group and we had a very amusing conversation about this. Apparently it's not unusual although more common with chemo. Luckily mine does not seem to have caused dry skin although it was itchy for a while. I got some cream from an Aussie company called Moo Goo . It's their Skin Milk Udder Cream and it's recommended by the Australian Breast Cancer society. It smells lovely, is recommended for chemo and rads skin issues and has worked really well for me. I used it on my reconstructed and irradiated boob and body. They have a uk website so you can buy online and have a range of products for other skin problems. They also have a deodorant that can be used by bc patients. I also have the Full Cream product which is richer I hope that helps. Take care of you xx",

It's so annoying that they announce the test is available but there's a delay while they sort out the funding when people need it now. This is such a difficult decision to make. We have said that if I need to go with the chemo I would only do FEC not FEC-T and if it was too bad then I'd stop. I was told that the CT and bone scans don't always pick up tumours that are very small or rogue cells and that the chemo mops this up but destroys healthy cells in the process. As my tumours were oestrogen receptive I feel that the tamoxifen is a more targeted treatment that, with the rads, were the key treatments. But I've no medical knowledge so we think we have to listen to what the bc team say and decide what works for us. I am worried that I might regret this if anything else flares up. My hubby has been brilliant but it's hard on us both. We don't have kids (2 dogs instead). I think I'd be close to strangling a 10 year old if I was left in charge of one at the moment :) I could have killed the dog when he ran off last week and made me chase him down the road and into the field in flip flops, not what the doc meant by light exercise. Thinking of buying shares in Kleenex seeing the number of tissues I've been through over the past few weeks, Angela x",

      "Content": "Hi Kim I completely get where you are as I am in almost the same place. I had left mx, lymph node clearance and ld flap recon 4 weeks ago. I was grade 1 and was told rads and tamoxifen would be the treatment. I was then told that the lymph node involvement meant that I was also flagged for chemo. I am very anti-chemo because of the aggressive nature of the drugs and the effect on my body and my oncologist completely understood and was supportive of my views. However, he went through the decision tool used and explained the percentage improvement associated with hormone therapy and chemo so that I really understood the basis for the decision in favour of chemo. It increased my survival rate by 6-8% which made it a yes for the medical team but a maybe for me. I have been very lucky to have the chance for an Onco DX test which assesses the likelihood of recurrence of cancer by analysing your tumour rather than based on a sample of cancer patients. My hubby and I have discussed this at length and have provisionally agreed that if low or medium risk I will probably not have chemo but we will talk it over with the Onc. My hubby said that this is the biggest decision we have ever had to make but he will fully support me if I say no to the chemo. I would ask if you can have the test which the NHS has just approved to fund although I understand that this depends on your local health authority. Mine was part of a trial that my clinic is participating in. Re the weeping, I posted here at the weekend about being a wimp for exactly the same reason. Had a complete meltdown and could not stop crying from body wracking sobbing to general tears. I had lots of supporting replies assuring me that I am not a wimp and my BC nurse said it's completely normal. This is such a rollercoaster emotionally and I think sometimes you just have to let it out. I feel a bit better today but am sure I'll have more tearful days. I think we have to accept the sh*t days and know that tomorrow will be better. Sending you big hugs and hope that this helps. Always happy to talk if you want. Xxx",

The surgeon did an amazing job but I am still lopsided and very self conscious about it. The whole experience has been an emotional roller coaster and a complete mind f**k (excuse the language) I had 6 months off work and a gradual return to work so I'm up to 4 days a week now. It's exhausting. My advice for what it's worth, take it slowly, cry, scream or whatever you need to do. If you have a bad day just go with the flow but remind yourself that things will look better tomorrow. Someone told me this at the start and they were right. The emotional healing takes a long time. You've had a massive shock, radical surgery and been thrown into a new and not very nice world. Don't rush to go back to work as it's very draining both physically and emotionally. I've also had to go back for financial reasons. I completely relate to what you say. Hate meeting people coz I think they all notice the change. Roll on autumn when I can get back into baggy jumpers. Dressing for the summer has been a nightmare with a softy that keeps feeling the need to look at the world. Over time it has got better but I'm not there yet. You'll get lots of support here as we've all been there. Just be nice to yourselves. Take care of you xxx",

Like you I've been told they took all the cancer and I just have tamoxifen now for 5 years and then something else for another 5 but I have really struggled with the emotional side if this. I go to a day group at our local hospice which has been really helpful. As everyone there has had or is living with cancer you can really be yourself, no need to keep up appearances and other people who've been through it have some really helpful suggestions. I also had to go back to work after my SSP ran out and have found it a real struggle. I am on a phased return starting at 2 half days a week but find even that exhausting. My GP is great and sees me monthly. I was worried because I keep forgetting things (I didn't have chemo which is usually blamed for this) and she said my brain is very busy healing my body so it can't do everything. At work they think that I am the same as before but just physically weaker but I feel totally different. I suspect that once I am back full time I'll look for something else, possibly completely different. I am getting a cotton mattress protector as someone told me this can help with the night sweats. Not sleeping is such a pain once you're working as you can't catch up or take it easy during the day. You will be able to cope but you need to look after yourself and not do too much. You are covered by the Disability Act so your employer has to help you return to work with a phased return etc. Macmillan have some great advice on this. Good luck xx",
