      "Content": "I go to a local hospice that offer treatment to those of us who have this bloody thing and they are taking on this new acupuncture as it seams there is a good result in helping with fatigue , so if they are doing it it must be ok as they would not put any of us in a position that would harm us as they are here to help and make our life through this journey a little easier , I quite fancy it , but due to not really starting my chemo yet, I do not need it , but later I may have a good look at it . I did have hypnotherapy the other day and if you are open to these things I highly recommend it , it made my day yesterday far more bareable and a lot easier. See my blog below it explains a lot more xxxxx",

      "Content": "Yes I got steroids for 3 days and on the first reaction they gave me more steroids and antihistamines and tried again , it's common apparently , some times the extra stuff helps and you can get through it but I'm must just be sensitive to it , they may try again next week or give me the tax after the fec instead of before but who knows , they have loads to chose from , so I may just give me 6 fec as that is another common choice of treatment , watch this space xx",

      "Content": "Hoping to find out today what treatment I will be getting due to the reaction I had on Friday, even though I only was able to get under a 5th of the bag in me I still have had side affect especially aches in my bones , I have had to take painkillers every 2 hours and do feel wobbly in the morning ,I can't imagine you guys out there that had the full bag and times that by 3 , you guys should be well proud you brave people. Now I have had a taste of things to come I'm now worried that its going to get really bad , They did mention that I may only have 6 fec instead I hope that it does not compromise my treatment , wonder how they decided what to give you , and if that does not work how they decided what alternative to have . Back to now knowing again",

      "Content": "So been for first chemo today and because I agreed to go on to a trial I was goin to have tax 1st , so all the bloods went well and I got hooked up to my new allie , but I have an allergic reaction I started having a really bad hot flush and wanted to take all my cloths off , but I didn't , so they there a load of antihistamine and steroids in me and tied again dripping it in slower and after 20 mins it happens again , so I have been pulled off this drug now and may possibly just having 6 fec instead , has this happened to any one else ?.?? We just feel really disappointed that I was not able to start my fight and I have to go back again next week to start anew course of action. , and I'm hoping this I not the way it's going to go and that the next set of drugs my body will accept.Â  Sarah xxx",
