      "Content": "I too was called back after a routine mammogram, the letter stated that I should feel free to bring someone with me.  My husband who himself was undergoing chemotherapy for prostate cancer insisted on accompanying me although he's not good in the mornings and it was an early appointment. But when I was called in first to the nurse and after that to a radiologist they both refused my requests to bring my husband in, even after explaining the circumstances I was told he could hear later.  As a result I was alone to hear that there was a mass I was shown scans and talked through everything and took absolutely nothing in.   I had to have a biopsy and ultrasound immediately and I was alone until the very end. I have since had surgery and am having chemotherapy at present which will be followed by radiotherapy and hormone medication.  I am doing well now and feeling very positive and only have praise for my treatment. But this first experience was unacceptable and left me very angry and feeling very negative for a long time. When I accompanied my husband for every appointment I was encouraged to be with him. I contacted the head of the Breast Cancer Centre to complain and she was most apologetic and said that the medical staff would all be questions as to why this had happened, and that my difficultexperience would be used in future staff training. I do hope all goes well for you, most cases are usually positive, but I feel it is essential to have someone with you whatever the outcome. Also take notes. Best of luck",

      "Content": "Thanks so much for your uplifting post Lizzy, my eyes are constantly streaming .   Finished my chemotherapy 9 days ago still have a few lashes not sure if they'll all come out before they start to grow back, but you really cheered me up. You're so right it has been the worst experience I still can't  believe I've managed to cope with everything that's been thrown at me.  Starting radiotherapy and Letrrozole shorty hopefully the worst is over.  Yes  we're all different but thanks for sharing something positive.
