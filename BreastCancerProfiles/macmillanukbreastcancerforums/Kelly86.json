    "Content": "Utterly gutted someone close to me who has breast cancer has been diagnosed with it spread to the bones. Doctors want her to take chemo to extend her chances but she is refusing she is elderly with heart failure which has affected what treatment she took in the first place limiting her choices with no surgery she was on pills which had little to no effect to shrink the cancer.  I guess what I really want to know is how long I have left with this person?!? I know what is inevitable but not how far away the end may be...this is not something I can speak out loud to my family...I just cant :( I cant tell you what bones it has spread to as she is unable to have an MRI scan due to pain when lying down. she is in a lot of pain ad using morphine at night times.",
