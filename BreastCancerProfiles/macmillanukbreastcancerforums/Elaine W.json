      "Content": "Yes it does make you tired and my sessions have got slightly longer as I go along so I feel tired a lot and as I have fibromyalgia amongst other things I am tired most of the time, the only answer is to go to bed, and let someone else do all the household stuff if you can, but as you go along I do feel that I have got a little less fatigued, eat well drink lots of water and sleep whenever your body tells you to.",

      "Content": "It was my understanding that is there is no lymphnode involvement and the margins are well defined as in my case then the radiotherapy is merely to help ensure there is no recurrence of the cancer, so it doesn't actually treat the tumour as such so I shouldn't worry too much, my op was on January 10th and I started myÂ radiotherapy on 10th March so that was exactly 2 months, that is in Southampton, but I think it varies depending on where you are and the demand for radiotherapy sessions in your area.",
