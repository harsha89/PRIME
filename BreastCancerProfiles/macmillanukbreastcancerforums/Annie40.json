      "Content": "Hi Rebecca Sorry to hear about your diagnosis. I too am having chemo first to shrink my lump. I visited my chemo unit first and also had a half hour chat with one of the nurses for her to go through what would happen, possible side effects, what to bring with me etc I also got to ask questions including coldcap questions. I found this really helpful. This was just after my first Onc appt so you may find they do the same, if not it's worth asking. I've had one round up to now. Wore my own clothes, didn' t have make up but wasn't told I couldn't I just don't wear it in the day. I sat in what was like an upright dentists chair, very comfy. I used the cold cap and at the moment I haven't had any hair loss. I'm on Day 18 now and generally I've read hair can start going around Day 14 so I'm hoping the cap is working. That said I have my second round this week so we'll see if that makes a difference. I think the odds are pretty 50/50 from what I've read. Works for some, I'm hoping I might be lucky. It really doesn't cause that much discomfort. The first 15 mins are the worst and then you honestly just forget it's there. It just adds a lot of time to your session as you have to have it on 45 mins before chemo and 2 hours after. Worth it though if it works. Take some paracetamol about 30 mins to an hour before your session. It is a personal thing and I know some don't get on with it but I found it totally fine and no headaches after and I'm quite a headachey person. Good luck with it all. Lots of love xxxx",

      "Content": "Hi Dorothee I didn't think you were being rude, I know you didn't mean it that way! We just all reply from our own individual experiences. I feel a bit rude not asking about your first chemo, sorry! how did it go and how are you feeling? Hope the steroids are working for you. Do you have anti sickness meds, which chemo are you on? I'm feeling a bit low leading up to the second one, I'm not worried it just puts you out of action and I feel guilty not being able to do much with kids/hubby. I was ill all last week as well so didn't do much then either. I suppose it's because I've got another Onc appt as well and so it's all real again this week. That said, I've felt a real difference in lump size since first treatment and have no redness now so I am also 'excited' (wrong word!) to get it in my system again. Hope yours went ok and you're not feeling too bad. Lots of love xxxxx",

Just do whatever you comfortable with as regards your modelling, take it easy as well as you need to get lots of rest after a chemo session. If you're not going to try the cap, the chemo is only about 40 minutes...that's the plus side of not using it!! Keep us up to date with how you;re doing. Lots of love xxxxx",

      "Content": "Hi Sascha So sorry for your shitty appointment, even though you were probably 'prepared' for it it is still inexcusable how you have been treated. how can you feel safe with your life in their hands when they are so cold. When are you coming over for a second opinion? Not just for that but to hopefully talk to someone who really cares about you. The first thing I remember about my ONC is that whenI sat down, bolt upright he told me to relax and that we were all friends in the room and I really did. That's what you need when you are going through something like this. I hope you are coming over asap so that it can give you some confidence about what will happen. I'm on the FEC, first 2 days...mostly slept as felt bit wobbly and sick. Haven't been sick though. Feeling tired and sicky has been the worst for me but started to get better yesterday which was Day 5. I suppose it's too early for me to give you any real advice but I know it's not as bad as I thought it would be. I feel 'pregnant' not much appetite, certain foods/smells making me nauseous. Not sure when hair will go, used cold cap and am a bit nervous about infection risk...especially with the kids and the germs they bring home! I haven't had constipation or diarrhoea...just been normal in that dept so all in all not bad really. Sorry today was awful, I know you mentioned prognosis without chemo but I reckon that would be about it for most of us without it. I bet with chemo you have a much, much better prognosis and maybe him only giving you 4 FEC this won't be as hard on you. I'm having 6. Sending you lots of love and hugs xxxxx",

I know you've said you've not started it yet anyway but just thought i would pass this on to you for you to ask too before you begin chemo. The hypnotherapy sounds interesting :) xxx              ",

You can still care for your hair, just not blow dry (can cold blow dry) or use straighteners. I still use my normal shampoo and conditioner as chemo nurse said if you used it before, no need to change. She did say using Simple shampoo and conditioner was good but I found it doesn't condition enough so just use what I did before chemo. I tend to bath more than shower now so I'm not wetting hair unecessarily. I suppose as a model not being able to 'do' your hair will be more of a problem, It's a good point to bring up though as you're not supposed to wash or brush it as often, but I brush mine and put it up in a scrunchy or loose clip and it's fine. If it does come out then so be it, will just opt for scarves. I have 2 young boys 7 and 3 and just wanted to keep looking 'normal' for them. Another good point Dorothee has made is ipod and books, makes the time fly! Lots of love xxx",

      "Content": "Hi Rosielee What is it you are feeling unsure of? Is it how treatment will go etc. I had my first chemo 11 days ago now and it really isn't as bad as I imagined. I presume all your surgery is over? If so, at least you will be cracking on with chemo and nearing the end of treatment. I'm doing it the other way round, chemo then surgery. I'm exactly like you, I have days where I'm positive and strong and then others when I think negative things all day and keep crying. We all do, it's only natural. Ok, we's all like to be positive 24/7 but we are only human and bound to be frightened. I know I am. Keep coming on here and writing, it really helps...you should look back at all my posts I'm always worrying about something or just offloading when I feel down! Someone, or lots of others on here usually say something to perk me back up. I find most of my support on here, my family are good too-hubby is great. But no-one really understands what it's like. Only others on here who have been through it or going through it. No questions are too silly and no-one minds if you just want to offload. I hope coming on here helps and if you want to send me a message anytime if you don't feel like posting, feel free :) I totally understand how you feel, we all do. Lots of love and a big hug xxxxxxxx",

I started my steroids today as nurse said it can stop you having a reaction to the tax as this can happen but quite rare, this has scared me a bit...and will be at the back of my mind. hopefully all will be ok.

The initial diagnosis really is the worst time, I still wonder how I got through it. I went through all the same emotions. Believe me, once you do crack on with treatment you do feel 'calmer' and have something to focus on and a timeline. I'm like you and have chemo first, I am having FEC for 6 sessions, had second one yesterday. Actual treatment and side effects have been fine not half as bad as I imagined. I was really worried about this too. I have 7 and 3 year old boys and just wondered how I would fit treatment/side effects in but luckily have an amazing husband and family. If you have this support too it will be of great help to you. Give yourself time to get your head around things and it will get a bit easier. It's a very up and down journey and not easy at times but you will get through it. Well done on your race for life achievement! I think having your wedding next year is a great focus and something nice to look forward too. I have been looking at holidays somewhere hot and tropical for next April/May...that's my focus! Keep coming on here, it really helps. Don't know what I would have done without all the lovely ladies and their support and advice. Lots of love xxxxxx",

I was diagnosed in May, through the holidays he was a pain and he lashes out mostly at his Dad. He actually hit him in the face last night and my husband was so upset he cried...but he doesn't punish him and I told him to do what we've always done. I actually find he's worse when he's tired so I make sure he starts getting ready for bed early..easier now the nights are drawing in. I find it difficult as it could be his age and he started Junior school this term so he could be worrying about that. He probably is picking up things but I get really upset when I try and talk to friends and family about it as they always say it's beause I'm ill so then I feel massively guilty. There's so much to deal with with this illness and a lot of guilt. All we can do as others have suggested is do what we always have, even if it's hard. Good luck xxx",

I'm having FEC and just before the actual treatment they give me a cocktail of tablets...anti sickness/steroids and I don't ever feel too bad until either late evening or the next day really and that's only nausea. I also have to hang around an extra 2 hours as I have the coldcap. Of course, everyone is different but hopefully it will be similar for you xxxxx",

If it was just a wig without the cancer I'm sure it would be different but this journey is so up and down. I always have highs followed by lows but the important thing is you still have occassional highs. I had a good hair day yesterday, I've kept most of mine using the cold cap, I cut myself a fringe and blow dried it for the first time in months (I'm due my last FEC soon) and I liked how I looked for the first time in months! I had a lovely afternoon out with my Mum but I still ended up going to bed last night in one of my panic moments, worrying about everything. I don't know if it's a bit of when we feel good  we forget about things so when we remember things come crashing down again. That's my analogy of things anyway....we don't really want this do we.

I keep getting a 'tingle' here and there and next week will be 2 weeks after first chemo so I reckon I'm going to be losing it. It's just something else to make it more real. It won't be long before this is all over and it will be growing back. It's such good news about your lump so as i keep being told \"chemo is your friend\" Hard to feel like that sometimes, I know. I'm off to wash mine in a mo. I've left it for as long as I can-about a week now as not been out this weekend. Am wondering if some will come out. Did you use cold cap this time? Sorry to hear your feeling wiped out too. I felt like that Days 2-5 but then felt ok. I'm really hoping it will be the same next time. Yesterday was the first day I didn't take any sickness meds. Hoping I feel ok now until the next round. Just remember to ring them if you feel wiped out for too long, hoping you'll be on the up very soon. Lots of love and a big hug xxxxxxxxxxxxxx",

But please don't see it as the end just yet. Talking about dividing her stuff will only add to your heartache and there is so much that can be done for your sister. Others have said on here too and I have took comfort from these posts I have breast cancer that has moved to lungs so understand all the scary stuff. I was only diagnosed in May but am now just living my life. I have 3 children, one at university and a 7 and 4 year old and I cried so much thinking I won't see them grow up but I am not going to be beaten yet. My ONC said I will just be treated as though I have a chronic illness and her words 'there are lots of treatments out there' These things may not be 'cured' but they can be kept under control for many, many years and being at the Royal Marsden is absolutely amazing. I don't know if you have been on the breastcancercare.org website but their secondaries forum is great and there is even a thread for 'success stories' ladies on there 8,9,10 years past diagnosis and they are just the ones who post. There are many people out there getting on with their lives as treatments are so advanced now. Take a look, just reading these from time time makes my day. We don't know what's around the corner..there's no 100% guarantee we'll all be around when we're 'old' so for now, if you can I know it's hard take one day at a time and think about your sister being in the best hands and you having many more years together. Sending you lots of love xxxx",

      "Content": "Thanks everyone for your messages, I know I must sound very irrational but my fear of this disease and dying seems to have taken over at the moment. I have just met my Mum in town for a coffee and being out has made me a bit more rational. I am going to wait to see what the Onc says tomorrow and try and just not think about it. Sascha, I don't know if you remember but had a horrible Onc appt where she said bluntly they wouldn't give me surgery as they didn't think it would make any difference...unless my boob was giving me problems pain etc she said because of lung mets I would have chemo with breaks in between to keep me stable. The other Onc said he wouldn't plan any treatment until this lot had finished and I had another scan to see what was happening with lungs as mets only small and would hopefully shrink. I suppose this is why my head is all over as I don't have a proper plan and the Onc I don't like is not very positive, all though saying that she did say there are lots of 'treatments but I just took that as chemo as this is what she had said earlier. i know I need to get things clear but last time I asked i came out in tears and terrified by what she told me and ever since I think I've only got a short time and now with boob flaring up etc I'm convinced that's it for me. i know all of this sounds really stupid and OTT but I really can't help it. I think i'm just drowing in it all. I upset my inlaws last week as when I had a crying meltdown I said I wish i was dead as then I wouldn't worry. Sometimes I feel like that and others I want to fight to stay alive. My children will be back soon so I won't have time to think and I got the M&S tenner meal deal for hubby and I to have a nice meal tonight so hopefully all at the back of my mind tomorrow. That's going to be interesting...a blubbing wrech is what they'll be getting. Catherine...lump not 1cmx1cm...I wish!!!! It had shrunk by this much last time when I dodn't think it had. It's still big but shrunk 5cmx4cm in all so the chemo has been working. Thanks again everyone, sorry for coming across as a nutter!!!! xxxxx",

Was a bit uncontrollable in the evening and just stayed in my bedroom. Am so worried about these patches that have appeared on my boob with lump. After first chemo all the redness and patches disappeared and lump reduced a lot. Now the patches are back and the lump doesn't seem to have gone down much. I did think that last time but it had gone down 1cmx1cm. I suppose I can't expect a dramatic reduction every time. I am just worried sick about theses patches. I'm sure it must mean it's not working and that the cancer is winning again. I feel sick and have already started the day in tears. Luckily the kids are at their grandparents and hubby has gone off to work. I have Onc appt tomorrow and I am absolutely terrified, I am always scared anyway. Being TN chemo is all I have, I was so positive when I could see the improvement in my breast and now I'm just expected awful news tomorrow. My mind has gone haywire and i'm just thinking what if this is it and they can't do anything for me because my cancer is so aggressive. I'm a real mess today and I'm so used to just getting on with things as normal xx",

Hubby has talked to them about me being ill, not in loads of detail and not the 'c' word. just think they're too young to get their head around it. When I start to notice hair coming out I think I will try getting hold of the book you mentioned. It's really good you are sharing the hair loss/style experience together. It does get very real once the chemo starts, I had my first last thursday. Finding things a bit difficult emotionally, think just with it being the first but also trying to remember I've started so I can finish! As will you :) Lots of love and big hugs xxxx",

Every littltr thing is such an effort I have completely lost the person I was and I just hate my life and me.

I'm Day 10 past first chemo so it will be interesting to see if I start losing hair next week especially as I've used the cold cap. I found the cold cap fine to use and the nurses snuggled me up in blankets so I didn't feel cold. had a couple of cups of tea as well. I think I too am more worried about losing eyebrows and eyelashes. I've got naturally long, thick eyelashes so will be gutted really. But hey-ho, as long as the chemo is doing it's magic on me i can live with it. I'm looking forward to being shown how to draw on eyebrows, what to do with eyelashes etc I have never been able to put make up on properly either so once I'm shown I'll definitely make more of an effort if I have a hairless head! xx",

I got the scissors out and cut myself a fringe! it actually looks loads better as I then blow dried it and straigthened it and left it down for the first time in months!!!!! Naughty naughty....I wouldn't use them every day or even week but I thought if I'm going out I will do. It's ok this morning, not all dropped out!!.

And no horrible smell so was impressed. It's turned out ok too, my grey is gone. Decided to do all hair as i went for the dark brown so didn't want it to just look dark on top. I'm not sure about the 3 seperate uses, you have to use all the powder in the pack I had. Just been looking at their website for refills but can't see them so I guess I'll just pay the £6.99 which isn't too bad. Could be they're out of stock as I wanted some of their shampoo but that's out of stock at the mo. You're right it does give you a boost. You do feel people wonder why you've 'let yourself go' I did with my grey frizzy hair, but then I would have been more paranoid losing it. It's just something else to deal with that you could do without. xx",

My Daniel Field stuff arrived this morning, very impressed as ordered thursday afternoon...chose free delivery which said can take up to 7 days but here it is this morn! Am excited! Not using it until Monday though as no time this weekend. But will let you know asap when I do and how I get on. I was a bit naughty yesterday, was a bit fed up of hair. It's about shoulder length at mo, all one length. The front is thin and when I tie it back it's starting to look like a cap on my head! I got the scissors out and cut myself a fringe! it actually looks loads better as I then blow dried it and straigthened it and left it down for the first time in months!!!!! Naughty naughty....I wouldn't use them every day or even week but I thought if I'm going out I will do. It's ok this morning, not all dropped out!!. I only had dryer and straighteners on a low heat, gave me a boost though to look a bit like my old self...but with a fringe haha! xx",

She thinks I could do with some anti depressents asap and she made me feel better about how I'm feeling. I have felt so awful since first tax, still do and I have second one thursday which is still really worrying me. Had my bloods done today ready for thurs but the way I feel, it won't surprise me if there's a prob. Mac nurse was reassuring as I told her I thought I felt so awful because of the cancer and I was going to die soon...I'm sorry I know that's so morbid but she said it's the toxins in the chemo affecting me mentally and physically. I know I sound a bit 'mad' but it was good just to be able to say anything and her not think I'd lost the plot. I've made an appt to see the Dr re anti depressents, see if they help me cope more. I'm still worrying I haven't seen any change in boob since chemo, with feeling so crap it's well and truly in my system so why isn't it doing anything to boob/lump. Just fed up worrying xxx  ",

      "Content": "Hi Ladies I went for my bone scan today. Wasn't the slightest bit worried by it.(the actual scan) Went in at 9.15 for injection and was told to come back at 12 so I nipped into town to do a bit of present shopping. Got back on time and was straight in the room. The radiographer started talking through what they would do, how the machine would cover my head/face first and be very close to my face....woah!! stop there!!!! I had a massive panic as wasn't expecting that. I just started saying I couldn't do it as claustrophobic and she said there was nothing on my notes and I said 'nobody asked'!!!! I cried....big baby! She was really lovely and said she could sit with me for the head bit and she would stop the camera coming to low.She said i should have been warned about the face bit. I was still a bit hesitant, she said it would only be for 5 mins so I just thought I've got to do it, no choice. Anyway, did it...was horrible but it helped having someone there talking about xmas etc. I was just really upset when i came out as felt embarrassed and am so sick of all this horrible hospital stuff. I KNOW it'll be in my bones, it's moving around everywhere else and I really don't know how I'll handle more bad news as I will just feel like that will be the end. I'm so sorry for being soooo morbid. I still feel rubbish from tax and I have my 2nd one next week, don't know how I'll cope. All I seem to want to do is drink but I have no appetite most of the time.....is this normal on tax? When I was on FEC, I felt crap for a week then normal for 2. This is very draining. Am also having a panic as just over 2 weeks since 1st tax and can't see any effect on lump size :( What if I'm someone chemo doesn't work on??? No good when you're triple negative. I'm so, so sorry to moan I just wish I could have something positive to cling to as depression and cancer are beating me and I don't want them too. Thank you for reading. Lots of love xxxxxx  ",

Never been in touch witn my BN and she's never been in touch with me, which I think says a lot really. I was ok and living with it all until scan a few weeks back showed crap results and all my treatment plan changed. I just haven't been 'right' since then. I was starting to take the dog on long walks for exercise but the tax has really wiped me out. I feel like a 90 year old woman. Thank you so much for replying and the nice big hug. Your post makes a lot of sense. I jut can't make myself see sense or hope for some good news or beat this for a few years at least and get a break from it. Thanks again xxxxxx",

I seriously think tax has a real depressive side to it and we can't find that light at the end of the tunnel anymore. I've had my treatment plan thrown in the air as things are not 'working' so I know how frustrating and horribly down you must feel. You just want a little bit of good news or something positive in all this shitty treatment but it ends up being one thing after another. My hubby is being really good as well and like you, I feel a bit useless, feeling sorry for myself, with my hair slowly coming out....what a catch!! i think we have just lost the person we once were but it can't be this crap forever. I'm sure once your wound is a bit better that will help you and I'm crossing my fingers for you for chemo, it's not trivial to want to feel better for christmas. As soon as I got my dates for this second lot of chemo I worked out how it fell over christmas and luckily quite good!!!! I hope I haven't made you feel more depressed, just wanted to let you know I understand how you feel. Whinge as much as you like, i know your journey isn't an easy one but it will get better and it will get to the end before you know it, you've been amazingly strong.

Something about the cancer that scares me but I know Ive put up with this for weeks now and its making me miserable. Im scared it might be my lung mets out of control. Or I havent been eating/drinking as much as I should...my lips are dry so cud be dehydrated, could that show nasty symptoms? Anyway, trust me to be wallowing near xmas.

I would like to get rid of my grey though so am going to ask the chemo nurses today if I can use the health shop vegetable dyes. I used to have to straighten mine as kinky and frizzy so it does look a bit of a mess, probably more to me. I tie it back though or use a clip so it's not that awful, I just can't wear it down and have it all sleek like I used to. I don't care though as long as the kids see me with my normal hair I'm quite happy. I can't work either as I'm a teaching assistant so if I have to just tie it back then all the easier :) It really is a personal decision and people's circumstances are different. I definitely thought it was worth trying and seems to be working so far but we'll see what happens after round 2 xxxx",

I hope you get some answers on thursday as I suppose 'shadows' and 'deposits' don't really mean anything definite for you yet so hard to have a treatment plan given to you yet. I had had lung mets at diagnosis and now have a spot on liver and a few bone spots behind affected breast. Still having chemo to reduce breast lump so it can be removed with clear margins. It's been a tough year, was diagnosed in May and just want rid of this boob but just seem to be being hit with bad news each visit, so delayed surgery. My FEC chemo was working really well to start with but then stopped Having secondary does scare you but there is so much they can do and they're always telling me that and they are on top of things so I trust them but obviously have my worrying time, not much I can do but follow their plans and you read a lot of positive things like it being treated as a chronic illness etc.etc I am now on docetaxal and my Onc is hoping this is going to kick some butt. The tax is hard but just had my dose lowered and that helps. So visualising proper butt kicking!! The shock does go down and even I surprise myself at how I just get on with things, even with a manic 4 year and 7 year old boys. Just have to keep positive and living each day and taking the treatments that we're lucky to have. Hope you get all your answers Thursday and you feel you can move forward with a great treatment plan that will work for you. Sending you and your husband lots of love, it's a tough time and having each other for support will help so much. Good luck to you and let us know how you get on this week. Much love xxxxx",

I have 3 children, a daugter 23 and 2 boys 4 & 8 and I am heartbroken. I cant have hormone treatment as I am triple negative so that narrows down my treatment plan. I still keep being told new treatments are comi g out all the time and I 'should' be able to have treatment with breaks in between. I try and think like that as much as I can but I do wobble. We all will its a ride where we dont want to think about the outcome too much but with support from family, friends and here we can get through the toughest times and not let it stop us see our children grow. All the best with your treatment plan, keep us up to date xxx",

All morning he was 'chipper' had the radio on, talking loads when really I just wanted to be alone in my fear! Then all the way to the hospital, he was chit chatting away and I just did the odd nod of my head. I couldn't talk as I was so scared. Anyway, the chemo wasn't as bad as I thought and I got in a state for nothing really, but natural I suppose. I didn't feel too bad after but BOY did I appreciate my husband being off then!! He was brilliant, waited on me hand and foot and took care of the kids. Your mum will probably take charge when she sees she has to. Go and have a bit of 'you' time. Can you ring the nurse yourself? If not, if you're appt is booked then try not to worry too much about her ringing. Good luck for tomorrow, it'll be over before you know it and it's great they're coming to you. It definitely isn't as bad as you imagine and apart form having bad cold/cough I have felt fine. Let us know how you get on, will be thinking of you xxxxxxx",

My hair has always been thick so it thinning wasn't really a problem. I'm really pleased I used it. i have a 7 and 4 year old and I've looked 'normal' to them which was my main reason for doing it. Also, I've got away without having to tell all and sundry about my condition. Mainly, it's left me with a bit of confidence through this awful treatment. If I'd have lost it I'm sure I would have learnt to live with it, but I'm so glad I gave it a go. it does make treatment time longer but my hubby stayed with me or i always had a good book.

I know everyone is shocked and wants to send their thoughts but it is really upsetting me today. I am really sensitive and down and I knew as soon as everyone knew it would make it all the more real. I had a text from a friend who works with my hubby, we haven't actually met up for a long time. It said 'sorry to hear about your cancer, thinking of you x' ok nothing really offensive but the 'your cancer' reduced me to tears, it's hard enough for me to say it never mind read it as 'mine' I've had 'OMG, so sorry to hear your news' again nothing bad but 'OMG'...it's all shocked messages, nothing calm...I would like to think I would be a little more sensitive and subtle. My Mother in law has texted me twice today and asked if I feel more positive, I said no! She said she was praying for me which totally freaked me out, she may not have meant it in the way I thought...i.e. I'm dying so need praying for me!!! But it's hard to be positive with everyone's pity being bombarded at me. She has literally just sent another text to say she has just told a friend who is on hoilday in Tewksbury so now she is off to pray for me in the cathedral! It's all a bit overwhelming. I'm not having a good week and I'm worried how I'm coping as I wake up each day feelng like I can't spend it thinking about all this. I know I'm lucky to have caring family and friends but I just feel at the minute all I have is their pity and doesn't help make me strong. Sorry for the offload. Hope everyone is having a good day, the sunshine helps a bit :) xxxx.",

I'm still very worried by it all so have left a message with Onc's secretary to get an appointment asap. My lump seems to have grown and I have seen to spots on boob now, it's red etc etc It's just so distressing as the chemo seemed to be working so I don't know what's happened. It firghtens me that the lump seems to have grown and when did chemo stop working? and has it spread more???? Have all these agonising questions 24/7. Been able to cope with everything up to now as it all seemed positive but this is just downright frightening :( Hopefully I'll have some answers and some treatment planned soon.

      "Content": "Hi Sascha Sorry you still feel like this. I feel a bit like this now, except the opposite really. I still have this manky breast, red raw...skin lesions, bigger than the other. I feel disgusted with myself. I have to hide away from hubby to dress and undress as I think he'll think I'm so gross. I can't wait to be rid of it and I was so close but then all this crap with chemo not working...new mets etc. Looks like if I'm lucky it may be next March sometime. But...time does seem to fly, only seems 5 mins since I first started chemo and I thought that would drag but seemed to fly! What I'm trying to say is time will go quickly and the 10 months will be up before you know it. I know you now have worries about the actual recon and can't actually help you there but I'm sure in the next 10 months you can do plenty of research, get lots of advice and you'll feel more confident in a decision. You are definitely depressed by it and who wouldn't be. I feel depressed, cancer and it's effects are bloody depressing we can all relate to that. Just wanted to let you know i'm thinking of you and sending you lots of love and hugs. Thank you too for your lovely reply to my message :) xxx                ",

      "Content": "Hi sending you lots of love and a hug. I know exactly how you feel as I finished my chemo 2 weeks ago, I have a scan booked then onc appt to discuss next plan. It' most likely mx as long as no more spread and lung spots hopefully shrunk. It really is the not knowing what's next. When we start chemo we just seem to concentrate on getting through that, the next step seems so far away at that point but when it starts looming I think the nerves kick in. I know that's how I feel anyway. It does make you feel low, it's only natural...it's a rubbish time and it does affect out partners and family, it basically turns our lif upside down. It does kick us hard when we read about sad news, we feel for them and ourselves and it naturally frightens us. I usually try and pick myself up by reading some positive things and finding hope there. It can be so hard at times but you will pull yourself out of it and feel positive again, it's so very up and down I find it difficult to cope at times but we can and will do it. Once we're on to the next step I'm sure it will get better...and near to the end :) Treat yourself and hubby to a nice night out or a romatic meal in and push that C to the back of your mind for a night, I do this sometimes...with a nice glass of wine :) xxxx",

Glad you feel better after surgery, it definitely must help having the lump out....I just can't wait to be rid of mine. What happens with results after surgery? I keep seeing about people going back after surgery for pathology reports, clear margins etc but not sure what all this means. Good luck with your results on Friday, let us know how it goes xxxx",

      "Content": "I started my chemo at the beginning of June, 6 rounds of FEC. This was to shrink my large breast lump and also lung spots which showed up on CT scan. I responded really well, and by the 3rd round my lump had shrunk 5cmx4cm. The next 2 rounds I struggled to feel any difference, had some swelling got paranoid and worried. I had my last round 3 week ago and then thoughht I felt a difference in the lump i.e. more shrinkage.Then all last week I had tenderness and stabbing pains, this week I have had more swelling and hardness and my boob looks a lot bigger. This is how things were when I was diagnosed so I am now beside myself, I just think it's all over for me and the cancer is taking over with a vengeance. I looked on the net and saw some things that said chemo killing cancer can cause similar symptoms but I still think it's going to be bad news. I have a CT scan next friday and I am more terrified now than when I was diagnosed. I know I come here and have these panic's and I feel awful bringing everyone down so avoided posting but today I have had such a meltdown and cried myself stupid I even had thoughts of not wanting to be alive and dealing with this, only for a bit. I want to be here as long as I can for my children but all this gets so hard to deal with and I daren't face any awful news after my scan. My boob is so sore I can't get comfy in bed. I am ringing my breast nurse tomorrow, but at the moment I am feeling so sorry for myself and just wanted to offload on people who might understand. I'm scared they will say I'm untreatable now if it's the cancer again growing so quickly, it's bad enough getting my head around secondaries but I am struggling to get my head around any of this at the moment. So sorry my post is overwhelming.... I can't talk to anyone :( xxxx",

      "Content": "Hi Londongurl Thanks for your lovely message, I think I've started threads before that have started other 'heated debates' haha! I think you can only feel how you feel, if you know what I mean. I can't make myself be positive but I know I have positive or 'better' days. I think waiting for results etc or having something to worry about makes me negative so the stuff about CBT is very interesting. I did have counselling booked at the hospital but then found I couldn't make myself go. I was fed up of being at the hospital anyway and I was also quite scared about talking through it all...silly I know. So, the book you mentioned sounds really good and I have just ordered a new copy from amazon at £10.50 so pleased and at least while I'm reasing it I'm not thinking about 'C' I have an appointment with Onc on thursday, his wednedsay clinic was full but his secretary was lovely as I got a bit tearful and she's put me in his specialist outpatients clinic on thursday which is normally for first appointments. I've also just booked a reflexology session for tomorrow, been thinking about it for a while and then saw some positive posts on here. Just had a lovely chat with her on the phone so I'm really looking forward to it :) Thanks again. Lots of love xxxx",

I think things do suddenly hit you, you get carried away by diagnosis/tests etc and then reality kicks in. Glad to hear your surgery is out  of the way, are you having chemo? The injections sound fun, but it's good your on the case. I am sure you can re set out your adventures once this is all over, it might give you something else to think about. It won't be long before you're back enjoying life the way you want it. Someone has that quote at the end of their messages, not sure who but it is an amazining quote. SO true!

He has a completely different plan from horrible lady onc; Horrible lady Onc- no surgery, not worth it as won't change life outcome (her words) just chemo with breaks in between. Top Dog Onc - Said although lump shrunk, not significant enough and wants me to have surgery to remove primary tumour...er...yeh!!!!! This is what I wanted all along and couldn't understand them leaving the cancer source in my body. He also said will look at CT scan, which is booked after 6th round and if lung spots shrunk enought then they can just 'keep an eye on me' Just feel his plan is so much more positive, since lady Onc told me hers I have been so down but now I actually feel like I'm being 'treated' and feel like I have a bit of hope. Rashes on boob are from tumour being so close to skin, hopefull disappear again after this round. Thanks for the support on here, it means so much xxxxx",

I then got diagnosed in May so after just 6 weeks in my new job I had to leave to start chemo :( The school were amazing and have always said they would keep my job open. I went in today to take a sick note, everyone was so pleased to see me and hugging me it was quite emotional! I have my last chemo next week and then surgery is planned but not sure when. I know you have to have at least 6-8 weeks break from last chemo so work have asked if I'd like to come back for a few months at least and I must admit I was sooooo excited by the idea, there's no reason why I can't. It was only because of the chemo/low immunity I couldn't go to work. the thought of doing something normal again has really made my day and now I can't wait. Ideally, I wouldn't have surgery until the new year and then I can get 2 terms in :) I don't think I'd have to have too much time off post surgery so could get back again. Only worry is lung spots, if they haven't gone/shrunk. There will be more chemo planned BUT I can worry about that when I need to and just enjoy living a normal life for a bit xxxx",

First 2 rounds made a big difference but seems to have slowed down now. I have small lung spots too so hoping these have shrunk and keep shrinking. I reckon I'll have rads and depending on that hopefully a break. I've been happy to have the chemo even if felt rubbbish as I  wanted some protection of any further spread, hope it's been doing it's job. Would be such a great outcome for me, especially now I have a plan in place. Would help get rid of some of that 24/7 worry xx",

      "Content": "I don't know if any of you remeber me saying this but I trained to be a TA over the last 2 years and I got a job in March, it was only my second interview and it was a school in my area so was over the moon! I then got diagnosed in May so after just 6 weeks in my new job I had to leave to start chemo :( The school were amazing and have always said they would keep my job open. I went in today to take a sick note, everyone was so pleased to see me and hugging me it was quite emotional! I have my last chemo next week and then surgery is planned but not sure when. I know you have to have at least 6-8 weeks break from last chemo so work have asked if I'd like to come back for a few months at least and I must admit I was sooooo excited by the idea, there's no reason why I can't. It was only because of the chemo/low immunity I couldn't go to work. the thought of doing something normal again has really made my day and now I can't wait. Ideally, I wouldn't have surgery until the new year and then I can get 2 terms in :) I don't think I'd have to have too much time off post surgery so could get back again. Only worry is lung spots, if they haven't gone/shrunk. There will be more chemo planned BUT I can worry about that when I need to and just enjoy living a normal life for a bit xxxx",

I don't feel like i csn't breathe or anything like that, just aware of the sound. It's not really loud either. I remember having it quite soon after a FEC session and was told it was the chemo doing it's job. Am Day 7 post tax so wondering if something similar? Don't want anything else to worry about at mo and was hoping for a plain sail 3 weeks this session :(",

It's my last chemo tomorrow so he talked about CT scan, meeting breast surgeon etc. He read all the notes into his computer as usual and listening to him it all sounded scary :( It's not like I don't know what's happening but I suppose now chemo coming to an end and all 'the what next' questions and 'how long' morbid questions. I heard him say he will wait on the results of CT to make sure no further spread or more lung spots or growth of the ones I have, this has scared me as he must think it's possible for more spread while having chemo...this is what scares me and keeps me awake at night :( I know there isn't much I can do about any of it, just offloading I suppose. Good news is I can go back to work and am going back on the 9th Oct. Just hope CT scan doesn't bring more bad news. Last FEC tomorrow though, that's a relief to know that side is over.

Yes, if my lungs are behaving I will be over the moon and will give me a much better prognosis...but, I am rather scared at what my next CT scan will show.

Silly question but is this tested for through a biopsy? I am still thinking I have it due to these ptches that have appeared on boob with lump. I have also read about chemo related patches too. Could I still be having 'new' IBC symptoms while going through chemo? Or am I just googling all the wrong info. I have Onc appt on wed so will mention the patches anyway, having IBC won't make much difference in my head as what I have now isn't great and I don't think treatment plan would be any different. I should have better things to do on a bank hol but I went a bit mad this morning gardening/housework and then had to go back to bed! Hubby dropped kids off and we were going to go on a walk but lovely bank holiday rain here. Might go out for a meal but have woken up just as tired.

I saw someone different last time, he was lovely and had a nice manner. Some continuity would help as then I might feel able to open up with them and feel comfortable asking things. I wonder who I'll get tomorrow!! I think you're right, to most of them we're just another cancer case and they are going by the text books i really wish i had a good onc who I felt was on my side and was really going out of their way to help.

I wouldn't feel guilty about the pill thing, I have never taken it in my life and I got breast cancer at 39. I'm sort of vegan, but i find the first few days after chemo i can only eat PROPER cheese sandwiches. Not the fake crap i buy or the soya cheese but proper, proper cheese...mmmmm.

I was a vegetarian but decided fish would be really good for me. I eat loads beans/pulses etc. buy them organic and dried from my local health shop. I am really good about 75% of the time and I know for my health I should really make more of an effort but I gave up alcohol, well wine. Hubby and I would share a couple of bottles over the weekend or a bit more if we entertained. maybe an odd one in the week. I think giving it up has given me a sugar craving as I never had a sweet tooth before but have been a bit naughty with cakes, sweets, chocs. Was never that interested before, was always a savoury gal. I'm also finding once I start to  feel well again after chemo it's like my hunger motor kicks in. Tonight I had a chippy tea..chips, fishcakes and mushy peas and I've just eaten a doughnut. I feel sick haha!! I'm a bit mad with myself as know this won't be doing me any good. Yesterday I ate a really big bag of crisps, I mean the big family bag things followed by a cream cake. I will get back to eating healthily tomorrow but I thinks it's my body craving stuff after feeling so ill for 4 days after chemo. I just wondered if anyone else went through similar once they were out of the chemo rut. Glad I'm wearing jeggings today, elasticated waist..mmmmmmm xxxxxx",

Not many treats in life at the moment. At least I've been good with wine, half of that is because, like tea I can't seem to face it anyway. Although, I wouldn't drink through chemo..you feel bad enough anyway! xx",

I went to the chemo unit yesterday to talk over with the nurse what would be happening and ask any questions. I also had a 'tour' and was sized up for a cold cap which I'm going to give a go. It all felt very surreal and very real and this is really all happening. I'm a bit scared and got even more scared with all the 'rapid response' talk. I know it's all a good thing and I will be finally doing something to try and get rid of this. Can't seem to get rid of the butterflies though. Got my heart scan today, seems that I am never away from the hospital at the moment. At least after chemo tomorrow I won't have any appts booked in for nearly 3 weeks. Hoping everyone is ok Lots of love and hugs xxx",

The sickness is the downside of FEC, but I think it is one of the better chemo's. My Onc said on a scale of 1-10 it's about 4 in regards of being nasty. Hope you feel better soon, mention it to your Onc on your next visit, if you're feeling really rough they may lower your dose so it's more bearable xxx",

Yes, the chemo nurse said do a dairy as she said you should get the same 'symptoms' on the same day each cycle so then you will know what to expect. I have my orange ice lollies ready and ice packs on the freeze to take tomorrow. The nurse did say even if I don't feel great after my first session it doesn't mean the others will be as bad.

It's just a shame it adds 2 and half hours to the session but will be worth it if it works. I t does sound like the delivery suite tour! I felt a bit awful really as people were sat having their chemo. I am taking my husband but have been told you can only have someone with you for your first cycle just because it gets busy in there. She did say if I really wanted someone I could do but I'm not bothered really. They did say not to drive home though and get someone to pick me up when I go on my own. I got a bit upset when they were talking about germs etc, I have 2 young children and they said if they get ill to have no contact/kiss them etc I'm usually the one who looks after them when they are ill...cuddle them etc. I know it's not forever but that did start the tears rolling. lots of love xxxx",

I just really need something to work asap.I think I am getting worse as it's leading up to xmas and I am having to leave hubby to everything. I am a useless blob. I got so upset this morning and hubby broke down as well, he was talking about if I hadn't got long left and the hospital weren't being 'honest' with me and that a book the macmillan nurse left had not left his mind. She'd left 3. One called 'Mummys lump' another about talking to children about cancer and ANOTHER for children when a parent dies :( OK I'm not kidding myself in any of this. I have mets and am triple negative so really not the best outcome but this was like a massive smack in the teeth. I can't grab any hope from anywhere anymore, been trawling forums and depressing myself. I used to have a bit of fighting spirirt. I know hubby is scared, worn out from kids/housework and he doesn't have anyone to talk to. I feel so scared too now, it's been a wierd day. Lots of 'triple negative secondaries' talk months, even with treatment. How do I fight, especially with tax being such a beast. Am I even fighting for anything much? :( :( xxxxx    ",

So that was the decision made for me. I didn't know how I would react to chemo, have had 2 so far and even if I could work I definitely wouldn't be able to for at least a week as that's when I feel pretty crap and then days 7-10 your immune system is supposed to drop so it doesn't leave a lot a time to work! That said from I have loads of energy this round and could have managed work say days 12-20? I only work part time. Further along the line I may get more tired, I don't know. If you have set hours on set days and there is no flexibility it migt be difficult. Do you have a 'boss' you can talk to about your hours? People do and have worked through chemo. I miss my job and the time it occupies, leaves me to dwell to much! That said I have a 3 year old and 7 year old and tbh I am loving being here for them :) It is hard to plan for the future, in my head it was chemo then surgery/rads. All done and dusted for the end of the year, back to work in January. But, having to wait to see how I respond to chemo first so that's my timescale out the window! I hope you don't stress too much, work is important but you being well enough to get through all this and cope with chemo etc is important. Good luck with it all xxxx  ",

I know I expect the worst now, it changes your frame of mind. You know the google rule!!!!! It never really helps, we all do it though to try and find a bit of comfort and then I always find something to fuel the fear as you have! How are things now? I think you should ring the GP back, I think considering you're a BC patient and you have been suffering so long they should see you immediately. I don't thinking sitting in A&E for 4 hours with potential germs is a good idea. What about the rapid response chemo number? They might ask you to come in and sort it for you as it is related to your condition. I can imagine having another health problem on top of everything else does not help your state of mind and I really feel for you. Lots of love and an extra big hug xxxxx",

I have got some counselling booked next week so hoping that will help me offload but still a worry all this trip neg/lungs etc I don't know too much about treating secondaries and am worried that because there are no 'after drugs' with trip neg that it applies to lung stuff as well. I just daren't look for anymore info. I have 3rd chemo in 2 weeks and they did say they would do another CT scan after to check lump and lung nodule shrinkage. I think I can probably ask more then as they will know how I am responding to treatment. My lump has shrunk a lot in just 2 sessions so maybe the nodules will have too or maybe they'll be worse and spread...that's my mindset at the moment :( How are you doing now, so sorry to hear you were ill after the first chemo. As if there's not enough to deal with!!! I hope you are feeling a lot better and your next chemo experience is a bit better! I had a chest infection on my first chemo, am on Day 10 now and so far am ok. I was ill by this time last time. I have got a bit of a sore mouth which started today so can tell I'm getting 'low' and feeling bit more tired but my sickness wore off quicker this time.

Only found out I was triple neg last weekend, been in a morbid mood trawling the internet. Ended up on breastcancercare as a lot of activity on their secondaries forum. I also didn't realise the full extent of triple neg :(  and then triple neg with secondaries has just upset me more as there is no treatment for me after chemo, surgery, rads so my body can just let it spread wherever it likes :( The only positive I read about TN was it responds to chemo and I can definitely tell, My mini football size lump is now about egg size-still huge I suppose in terms of prognosis etc but it is good. I am also scared as i haven't had an MRI or bone scan so it could be somewhere else now I've read how aggressive TN is.

Michelle, I would perhaps get in touch with your breast/chemo nurse for extra advice.

I'm also glad to see the back of the cold cap, even though it's worked. Glad I stuck with it. Surgery next...gulp, glad to hear that most of you seem to think that this is easier than the chemo! xxxx",

I'm just wondering who gave up, who has a bit etc. I actually had a glass last night as I just felt like a treat after a shitty few weeks. I know I've read odd glass of red wine can be good for you, but can't drink that. I just thought maybe a small glass or 2 at the end of my 'good week' each month, life is pretty crap going through this  but I kinda feel guilty today!! Lots of love xxxxx",

It measured 10x8cm after round 3 or 4, I forget now! But now boob is swollen and lump has grown BUT when I hopefully see onc this week I am desperate for them to say they will take the f***ing thing out, sorry for the foul language but I have spent 10 months arseing about with this lump, it's so distressing obssessing over it. Onc said surgery would be next but now with this spanner in the works I'm worried he'll say more chemo. When I say worried, I'll be glad I can still be treated but if it's this aggressive I just really want it out now...I think they will see how distressed i am as i know I am going to cry at this next appointement. I also want it out so it can't spread anymore. As you can see I am totally obsessed with my BC at the moment, it's just a bit of a nightmare as we all know. i hope everyone is having a good weekend and I hope I get this appointmeny asap so i don't have to keep badgering you lovely ladies.

It's natural to be scared of chemo, I was terrified. Couldn't even speak on the way to my appointment. But it was really ok. The chemo nurse was lovely and it was all pretty straight forward. I have felt fine since as well. Day 1-5 I felt very sicky and tired but the meds really helped and the sickness tabs work very quickly. I haven't been sick. Each day I have felt better. Am 10 days past now and a bit tired today but overdid it yesterday. It really isn't bad at all. I have 5 more rounds to go so hoping they'll all be like this. I wanted to try the cold cap but, again, wasn't looking forward to it but it was ok. Very cold for about 10-15 mins then you get used to it. It's downside is you have to have it on 45 mins before and 2 hours after treatment so it does make for a long session but worth it if it works. I keep reading hair tends to come out 2 weeks after first chemo so we'll see what happens next week! Sending you a big hug xxxx",

Well I had 3rd one today, not a lot of choice really :( I also found out my blood count was low yesterday and i told them i was short of breath and everything was an effort e.g. just climbing my stairs i am having to sit at the top panting! So they decicided on a transfusion which i also had today so a long day at the hospital, am very tired. Hope the blood makes a difference as I've not done a thing with feeling so awful. Feeling really guilty and sad that I missed my youngest's christmas show at nursery and my other son's at school this week. Had a cry earlier, then got mad, then made myself more tired haha! Hope it all helps me sleep tonight :) Just wanted to say thank you. I will catch up with everyone's posts over the next few days. Much Love xxxxxxxx    ",

I just can't get my head around tax very well and I suppose I can't beleive how awful it is or how it's stopped my family functioning. Poor hubby takes them to school every day and my eldest is really starting to play him up which then makes me me feel guilty/cross. I felt awful this morning as I thought he was going to cry as he's been is as well. At least he is off now for 2 weeks, it's also hubby's birthday tomorrow and I haven't planned as much as I used to, I'll be lucky to even drag myself up with him. Anyway, enough moaning and thank you for your virtual hugs and good thoughts. Lets it all hope we have a good christmas week, it's creeping up!

I can't walk upstairs without almost collapsing, my legs feel so weak, I feel so 'ill' when I have to be on the move. Feel ok when in bed and hubby says I have colour. Is it the tax? I cry every night thinking aggressive cancer has it grip. TMI my manky boob is now covered in ulcers etc and is being dressed everyday. I can't even tell now if tax is working as I cant feel a lump as boob is just hard. I get the feeling its not working like the FEC and am now untreatable with all my mets as well. I'm sorry this must be the most morbid post ever, but just feel so awful. Can tax make u so weak and disabled? Deep down I cant stop thinking about dying 24/7.

I have been very up and down since diagnosis last week and last night I had a big cry to hubby who cried too. I have been looking at boys a bit older than mine and wondering if I'll see them at that age and thinking all sorts of dark thoughts that just came to a head last night. Hubby and I had been out for a lovely meal as well and I just wished our life was normal again and I could just fully enjoy everything. I am so scared of the scan showing something as I have large lump and sore/swollen armpit for months, it's had time to get around. if they tell me this then I just don't know how to have any hope for treatment or beating this :( My lump is already a problem as it's so large and needs to be shrunk by chemo so even that is a big worry for me incase it doesn't work. I know I have probably gone over this so many times but I just feel like these obstacles are going to be a problem somehow and my treatment won't be straight forward....maybe just my huge negativity but I can't seem to drag any positivity into myself at the moment and I'm trying to. I'm paranoid at the moment as well with the hot weather, as only wearing tops I can't hide the fact that one boob is obviously bigger that the other and feel that everyone is looking. Feeling a bit of a freak! I know I'm a moaning Minnie on here, I look forward to the day when I can post soething positive. Hope you all have a good weekend in the lovely weather. Having a bbq later which the kids will love so I'll try and take my mind off things. xxx",

This has obviously pushed things forward now. My last chemo was on the 20th September. Just worrying there is a long gap now before treatment plan, well not worrying...I quite like the idea of a break. There's not much I can do about it but do you think anything 'nasty' could be happening in those few weeks?

I've had chest infection that is just starting to get better now so the antiobitocs have kicked in. I am on those until Monday. I've also got a sore mouth, so much so it's been difficult to eat last few days. The hospital are doing me a prescription to pick up in the morning for some mouth wash. I am guessing I am pretty run down and am worrying my bloods will show this and I won't get my chemo next week. I dod ask the chemo nurse about taking any kind of vitamins and supplements but she said not to bother. just wondering what you ladies think? I am trying to eat fruit but have given up until I get the mouthwash as just too painful on my mouth. Lots of love xxxxxxx",

I coud have spent a fortune but I have been eating loads of fruit and veg so didn't think I would go too mad with supplements, but costly! I forgot to write down spirlina and wheatgrass so will def go back for that as it's all buy one get one half price at the mo. Sorry your bllod count got so low, bet it was a bit of a worry when they said they may have to stop!!! That's what worries me as I'm having chemo first to shring my lump...can't miss any! I don't eat meat but will go fish n veg mad from now until next week. Stocked up on my nuts. Will avoid sugar, thanks for that tip. Will make sure I get plenty of rest. Bloods on Tues so not too far away and still have dregs of this cold/infection. Fingers crossed bloods will be ok. Hopefully after all this great advice, they will be xxxxxx",

After a few days my boob and under my arm got really painful and seemed to be swelling. I was a bit panic stricken as thought it was growing, but others told me on here that that was normal and the chemo doing it's work. It stopped hurting and the swelling went down. the last few days it has felt smaller and my bra hasn't felt as uncomfortable. I decided to try on a bra that had got way too uncomfortable to wear and use it almost as a test to see if it fitted me again, and it does!!!!! It had gotten that my boob would not fit in the 'cup' at all but now it does again. It is still bigger than my other boob and still needs a lot more shrinking but am feeling really positive now after just one round of chemo :) xxxxx",

I also now have 1 spot on my liver now which is def cancer, so looks like while the chemo wasn't working it managed to move around just as I was imaginging it was. I start 6 rounds of docetaxal tomorow and onc thinks this could blast all the mets. I'm feeling pretty down though. 6 months down the line and I'm nowhere near beating this thing I've acheived nothing and I'm still stuck with this goddam boob/lump...it just gets worse.

I did loads of housework and maybe I should have just had a complete rest. I was really snappy with everyone and the kids were really playing up. I just couldn't cope with it. I went to my room and just broke down crying. I felt gulity about having no patience with the kids and I feel hopeless in my treatment ahead. I am so worried about the scan checking for spread as I had lump a while before diagnosis and my under arm is swollen. I am so worried about my lump size, I have mentioned this lots. I keep hearing the Dr saying it's a 'significant problem' It is nearly my whole boob. I can't help feel the prognosis is not good before I've even started any treatment.  I basically cried myself to sleep in the end. I don't feel much better this morning, still very tired as my 3 year old has awful sleeping habits, then they were both up at the crack of dawn! I know I should be enjoying time with them but I feel so drained, emotionally and physically. I'm not doing myself or others any good especially as we were talking about stress levels yesterday.

      "Content": "Hi Sascha, I feel exhausted. It's almost like now I know I've got cancer I can feel it. No energy, tired etc but like you say that's probably all due to the diagnosis and stress of last week. I don't think I'm that fussed knowing if IBC or not. I mentioned it at diagnosis and Dr said it didn't say and even if it was the treatment plan would be no different. And he said to keep off the internet! I'm assuming he meant I shouldn't be diagnosing myself! My big fear at the mo is spread, I have a niggling pain near my shoulder blade so am convinced spread to lungs-I really don't do myself any favours I know. Some of me also wonders if it's the weight of my 'manky' boob as it's directly in my back behind it if you know what I mean. That's what I think when I'm rational...most of the time it's spread. And why not, I left it long enough too. They said lymph nodes in armpit were swollen hence scan but said there was nothing to suggest spread but I can never think positively and I suppose that is a 'bit positive' Thanks for taking the time to reply, you always make such an effort I really appreciate it. I wish I could help you a bit more. Dr's are a bit blunt I suppose but then wih someone like me it might be good as I find hidden meaning in everything...not good!! xx",

Do you get chance to snooze in the day to catch up? Saying that, I've tried not to nod off in the day and then seem to sleep better at night. I hope you're feeeling a bit better today about the chemo. I know I thought to myself I won't be nervous now about the next one but I know when it gets nearer I will. Just remeber you will be 2 down after today :) Looking forward to hearing about the book and thanks for the positive grade 4 story, amazing! Dorothee-my hair is ok at the mo, but am only 1 week past chemo. It loks a mess with no being about to blow dry, colour or straighten it but it's there for now so not complaining. I think I read somewhere it gets affected after the second cycle? But I suppose we're all different and maybe the cold cap will work. Are you going to try it?   Lots of love xxxxxx",

I seem to be always on at them. They are a handful when togther but I have little to NO patience at the moment. I keep saying I'm going to start this yoga dvd and still haven't. I don't get a great deal of spare time as youngest is only at nursery until11.30am. Just wondered if anyone has any relaxation techniques that help, I'm sure my illness was brought on by lots of stress in the past and me not being able to handle it very well or seeking help for it. My only other option is anti deps to perhaps chill me out...but more drugs??? :( Lots of love and hugs xxx",

All your kind, lovely and positive posts and your all right of course! I will do all I can to beat this and like some of you have said, I have to focus on the fact there are treatments and I am responding well. I'm going to read the books I have...properly! Make some changes and work towards knowing I'm doing all I can. The Dr I have now is not the original Onc, she's his registrar. I did see her last time though. She even told me today she should have measured my lump last time but she forgot so I m slightly worried being under her. I will get all my chemo done then they are scanning me and planning the next step, then I may ask more or ask for another opinion. Just going to concentrate on the chemo it's about all my mental state will cope with at the moment. I will catch up with all the other posts on here later, some good/distracting news is I'm just off to pick up my new car. Really excited. Been 8 years since I've bought one!!

Just had some vegetable pizza and am in bed feeling VERY queasy. How are you doing? Fingers crossed they'll be no little vacations for you and I'm hoping for an antibiotic free round! Planned a hol for the 30th July and now chemo nurse has made me all nervous as she said I need to make sure I know where the nearest AnE/hospital is incase I'm poorly. I can see her point and I would have done that, I told her it would be Day 12 of my cycle so not my low days but she said it doesn't matter. Why do I always come out of that place with something else to worry about haha!! She was lovely though and concerned so I'm not knocking her and I'm still going to bloody enjoy my holiday. It's only for 4 nights as well and I won't go to crowded places or swim etc. I don't think I'll be able to do anything about the counselling appt as I have tried already, might be time to get some anti depressants though. Well I'm halfway through FEC now, hope to see some good results again this round just to show my Onc I'm worth saving ;)!! Hope you're feeling ok and have a good round this time.

The good news was she measured my lump and said it's shrunk loads and that's a great sign that the treatment is working. She said it should be doing the same on the inside (lung mets) she then said I probably wouldn't have surgery as because I had the spread to lungs having surgery wouldn't alter the life outcome!!!! I was just so shocked, I know my situation isn't great but I am just devastated. She said there are lots of treatments for me and because I'm responding so well to the FEC that's really good. But....she obviously has little hope for me and so neither do I now xxxx",

You're also right about the shrinkage and I am focusing more on that now, at least there is some positive. I had my 3rd round of chemo yesterday so keeping my fingers crossed it keeps on shrinking!!!

      "Content": "Hi Kelly Definitely the right place, just sorry you've had to join. You will get amazing support. Your feelings are the natural feelings we've all been through and the shock is awful but I promise you it does 'get better' I was diagnosed a couple of weeks after my 40th birthday. I knew something wasn't right and was expecting bad news but it was still a shock for me and family. I have a 22 year old daughter at Uni and 2 boys at home, 7 and 3. I went through all the same feelings as you about my youngest especially. Worried myself sick how my 7 year old would be a he is an anxious child, sometimes telling me before school he'll miss me and looking like he will cry. I used to cry on the way home thinking how he would cope without me. We all have these morbid thoughts to start as we have no idea what's going to happen and it's the 'C' word. I had 3 weeks of different tests, I was at the hospital 3 times a week I was still terrified and in shock the whole time. I daren't tell family and friends what I thought or my fears as I didn't want to scare them so I use this site an awful lot and it has helped so much to calm lots of fears and i have some lovely friends on here. I have a large breast lump and some spots on my lungs so I am having chemo first to try and shrink stuff down. I had my first chemo last week and it wasn't as bad as I thought and am feeling quite good this week (touch wood!) I also feel that the shock has worn off now and you will find it does too. it is all up and down and good days and bad days. I still think when I look back at my posts from the beginning I am generally calmer about stuff, it's hard at your when you're at the beginning to think you will feel any better but you will and you will be around for your children as treatment is amazing. I still have a cry when something sets me off, do it...it will help. Keep coming on here for support and feel free to message me if you need to talk. Lots of love and a big hug xxxxxx",

It's when my eldesy (7) gets home from school and he and his feisty little bro (3.5) get together it's like 3 hours of madness! Everyday I tell myself I'll be calmer tomorrow haha! Maybe I'm expecting too much from myself. My chemo nurse has put me forward for counsellingm she just asked me last week if I wanted to try it and thought I would, maybe they'll recommend anti deps alongside it. Although I reckon I might be a wreck if they ask me if I'm ok with allsorts coming out, they might end up locking me away!!......now there's a thought :) I think I could perhaps do with some support of that nature, like you say we shouldn't be too proud to admit when it's difficult to cope because in all fairness it pretty much is. Sorry to hear about your spinal pain, but glad drugs are helping. Thanks for the top advice Much love xxxxx",

I must come across as looking like I don't want to know too much as the first Dr said it didn't say I had IBC when I asked and told me not to google. I take it from that comment he thought I was diagnosing myself. I did ask about the lung thing and he just said 'it could be worse, it could be better' and that the chemo would hopefully sort it. I think at the time of appt's I take in what I need to know and I can't handle too much detail and don't feel it helps at the time. It's only afterwards I get niggling thoughts. Maybe further down the line I'll be braver, at the mo I 100% trust the ONC and my hospital has an amazing rep. I don't do myself any favours I know. In a way you are probably right, just can't cope with too much info at the moment xx",

This is the best I've felt in months even though a long battle ahead. I met my ONC for the first time who was lovely...didn't say one negative thing which is good for a person like me. I had my CT scan results and unfortunately some spread to lungs but he said it could have been better and could have been worse and he's hoping chemo will shrink that and my massive lump. Bless him he didn't even mention the size. I am awaiting a phone call as they want me in chemo asap. I have 6 sessions and after 3 they'll give me another CT scan and check lump size and lungs to see if responding. he said all my other organs were clear and this was the main thing so I feel quite 'happy' I know there will be more worry ahead but for the time being I actually feel aok and just want to enbrace that for a while.

I was told Derby was brilliant for treatment and that the Onc I had on my first appointment was the best there. I only saw him that once. I've seen this one twice now, last time she forgot to examine me and this time she hadn't even read my notes and blurted out horrible info without a care in the world. So i am disappointed with my care, I know my diagnosis isn't their fault. I don't know why I was passed to her, I'm paranoid that it's because my original Onc thinks I'm not worth dealing with as I've not got long. I have woken up this morning with all the most depressing thoughts going through my head, I also have chemo later so dreading that. I don't know how to pick myself up or stop focusing on all these horrible thoughts. I keep gong off for a cry where no one can see me as i don't want to worry them. Sorry for being like this, I know I need to be strong. I appreciate everything everyone has said. Picking up my car did take my mind off things for a bit...Dorothee-it's a new shape vauxhall meriva, very nice :) We took my hubby's parents out in it and went for a meal. I couldn't stop myself having a couple of glasses of wine, it helped for a bit. Not great night before chemo but needed something for the shock. bed bound after today's chemo and am dreading how this round will affect my already, very low mood. Sending love to all of you, I know we're all in the same boat so sorry for being so self-absorbed at the moment. I'm sure I'll be up and fighting soon. Lots of love and hugs to you all xxxxxx",

I had lung mets on diagnosis so already had spread but I was/am still treatable. All I am trying to say is you could be worrying unnecessarily or if the cancer has spread you will still have lots and lots of options. i know this is a bit of a blunt reply and i hope I've not upset you. I'm not saying any of the symptoms point to this (I had bleeding piles on FEC :S) and tbh the lung stuff with me was a surprise as I'd had NO symptoms at all. Our mind can go bonkers and be very cruel to us. Why don't you ask your ONC for a CT scan? Tell him how much you are worrying, this could put your mind at rest? I'm so sorry to hear about your Dad and this obviously heightens your fear of cancer. Sending you lots of love and a big hug, I hope things feel a bit better soon xxx    ",

I asked the chemo nurse if cutting my hair short would make any difference and she said no. My hair isn't too long. it's a bob about up to bottom of neck. My hair is VERY thick though so I was hoping with the cold cap it might just 'thin out' It just looks a bit of mess at the moment as I can't blow dry or straighten it so it's a bit frizzy and I'm all grey at the roots :( I don't think it's trivial and I hope you get some advice. I know my hair looking a bit crap makes me feel a bit crap so you go ahead and treat yourself to a colour and cut :) xx",

You're right Catherine, mornings are not good and not just for a few hours ALL morning haha! I'm sure it will get better. I went to sleep at 1pm and then got up a 4pm so my body sure does need it. I hope it's all helping. I have an hours school run which dreading but hubby taking Sam to nursery and I may have to nip Will in the car, I can't imagine walking it. I was only given all the sickness meds for 2 days, must mention it next time that could do with them lasting a few more days. (apart from the mets) Am just having a panic as hubby back at work but my mum is coming up tomorrow. I'm sure it's all doing me good and it's good it doesn't last all day. I ate my tea outside so some nice fresh air, the sun has actually come out here! Here's hoping for a better day tomorrow and thanks for the advice lovely ladies. Lots of love xxx",

I have mostly stayed in bed as not feeling great. it's probably not quite as bad as I expected but still not great. I feel awful in the mornings and can't get with it until late afternoon. I feel like I did when I was pregnant. The thought of food making me heave, very tired, constantly nauseous, water and tea have started to turn my stomach. I know it could be a lot worse than this, but I had a bit of a cry today as not felt physically up to anything. Hubby has been brilliant with kids but just wish I could be doing a bit more. I know it's early days, just wondering from anyone elses experience when they start to feel a bit better? I got my period yesterday which was shitty timing and isn't helping but just looking for a bit of light at the end of the tunnel. Thanks xxxx",

Should I just put up with it knowing it's at it's hardest?? That said, we have to have some quality of life and I think we are given the highest dose to see how we cope and they do have a limit they can come down to. They know what they're doing and it's no good them making us more ill, more prone to infection etc. I don't think you can be expected to stick to your original dose with what you've been through Sending you a big hug xxx",

Think it's because I had so much growing back on the top from some of the bits I lost with FEC. But I seemed to be hanging on to my rats tail of a pony tail for dear life! I wasn't brave enough to go for the whole bare scalp look so did a high grade and just looks like a really short crop, it's amazing how thick it has got on top! It looks and feels a million times better but I did cry like a baby throughout!! Hubby said he loves it...bless him...I knew he would. He said he wasn't just saying that and that I looked like I had been to the hairdressers haha! It's done now, I'm going to go to town in a bit and look for another nice hat and some pretty earings. Got to have some retail therapy after that! Hope you ladies are all ok and have some nice plans for the weekend xxxx        ",

      "Content": "Hi everyone. my name is Annabel. I am 40 years old with husband and 3 children- 22, 7 and 3. I don't know how I've gone on these last few months but to cut a long story short I am booked in the breast clinic on Monday and expecting the worst. I seem to have all the classic signs of IBC. It didn't start like that, I had a lump/thickening that I didn't notice for a while so not sure how long it was there. Went to Dr and said to wait until my next period. It didn't go..i actually waited a couple of periods. It continued to grow and went red so visited the Dr. I hate to admit I was terrified after googling and it took a few weeks to go back. Dr thought after a look and feel that it was an infected cyst and gave anti-biotics...the breast redness did seem to go down but still pink. I know I have most of the symptoms of IBC and a very hard mass in my breast so I kind of know it's not good, if that makes sense. i've tried to fob myself off with cysts/fibroadenomas etc but I think i need to accept what's coming. I'm not being a drama queen about it, in fact I have been carrying on as normal through the day, doing my job as a TA looking after the kids etc. At night I'm in bed terrified and crying for my children, I can't bear not to be here for them. I haven't spoken to anyone about this in all the time of my worrying. I think I must have been in a bit of denial. I have only just start to talk about it because of the breast clinic to my husband, best friend and Mother in law. Everyone is really dismissive and telling me it will just be a cyst when I know it it's going to be bad. I'm sorry if I am waffling, I just felt the need today to try and talk to people going through similar. I'm almost at the point...and I apologise if this is really insensitive...where I just want the diagnosis and just get on with getting better instead of all the worry and wondering of the last few months. But then I think about the treatment and I am terrified. I'm sorry for posting here but I couldn't find a forum for 'worried' and am pretty sure I'll be a proper member next week if you know what I mean :( Thank you for reading.",

If you google 'look good feel better uk' it will bring up their site and hospitals that do it. It is such a boost. We were given a good bag...oh my! It had £250 worth of stuff in it, I kid you not. There were things like Chanel lipstick, clinique face cream, all top brand make up/face stuff stuff like lancome, elizabeth arden etc Everyone even had a bottle of perfume...big size, mine was Armani code...saw online that was £70 alone. Just in shock! We got to use all our stuff and were shown step by step how to use it and the best way to apply the make up. Brilliant for me as I've never really worn make up much as no clue how to put it on properly. It was lovely to speak to other women and it was really nice to see us all just excited and happy and all looking fabulous by then end of it. The volunteers who run it were brilliant too. Everyone came out feeling really lifted. I really needed that this week! Am really impressed that these big companies donate all these products and that 'look good feel better' is a charity. Such a fantastic idea for us ladies who are going through a crap time in our lives. Lots of love xxxxxx",
