      "Content": "Hello Michele Thank you for posting. And for sharing your insights. It does sound like it can be a tough time trying to manage the two illnesses at the same time.  I am still in the process of collating all the great tips and advice that people are sharing, but may come back to yo if i have any questions - if that's OK? Hope your last chemo goes well. BW, Richard ",

May be the advice your diabetes nurse gives you. Anything you think helpful really! I hope that the chemotherapy goes well - and that you don't have any issues with your diabetes. BW, Richard ",
