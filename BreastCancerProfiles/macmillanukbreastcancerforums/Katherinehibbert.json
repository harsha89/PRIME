    "Content": "Hi Louise, I'm only 32 and I'm electing to have a bilateral mastectomy asap as I had breast cancer in April and then found out that I am a BRCA 1 gene carrier meaning it's likely to come back. It's so scary hacing cancer at our age insn't it! Have you had your op yet? If so, what type of reconstruction did you go for. All of them sound pretty horrific. I hope yours went well and you are on the road to recovery. Any advice you can offer on the recon would be greatly appreciated. Katherine",
