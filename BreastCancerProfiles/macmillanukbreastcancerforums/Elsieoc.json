      "Content": "Hi Lynnyk, Sorry to hear about your diagnosis. Did they tell you what treatment you will be having? I know when I was first diagnosed the hardest bit was not knowing what was going to happen although I still remember the relief when I came out of my appointment having been told it was cancer. Although it was the news I dreaded, I found the waiting worse than the actual news itself. Once I knew what I was dealing with I could begin to focus on what to do next. It's good that you finally had some sleep. I think the whole emotional side of things can be hard to deal with and lack of sleep can add to this. I hope your treatment goes OK. Wishing you all the best. Lorna x",

      "Content": "Hi Kath, Did you get a prosthesis from the hospital? I am a 40GG and I now have 1 breast smaller than the other due to surgery. I went back to work this week and the nurse fitted me with a breast prosthesis which just fits over the top of my breast inside my normal bra. It's huge but it does even things up & makes me feel a lot more confident. I was told that I can even use it for swimming (although I won't be able to go anyway once the chemo starts) I think you can also get ones that you sew in but, once in place, the one I have stays put. Perhaps you could ask your breast care nurse about getting one? I don't think this is minor at all, before I had the prosthesis I covered myself up with scarves & things but was really self conscious about going out and thought everyone was looking at me. I work in a school office and would not have had the confidence to go to work without it. Good luck with the rest of your treatment. Lorna x",

      "Content": "Hi MamaSm, In addition to all the other great advice that people have already given you I would recommend of having a notebook or diary to make notes about your treatment. I had my first round of FEC nearly 3 weeks ago and I wrote down all the doses of each different medication I needed to take and when to take them. I then ticked them off each time so I didn't forget whether I had taken them or not. I also wrote a few notes each day about how I felt which was really useful when I saw my oncologist because I was able to refer back to them when he asked how things had been. I also recorded my temperature each day so I could easily notice any changes.  Good luck for Friday, I hope your treatment goes well. Lorna x",

      "Content": "Hi Carla, I had a lumpectomy in January and it all went really smoothly. I was signed off work for 3 weeks but, as I work term time only, I was actually off for 4 weeks in total and I found that I really needed the extra week because I was still quite tired. Your body will tell you when you are ready to return to work. One piece of advice I would give is to accept all offers of help. People don't offer unless they really mean it and you need to look after yourself both physical and emotionally. Also, make sure that you do the exercises they give you. At first you might feel like you don't need to but after a couple of weeks you will realise the benefits of them. The final thing I would say is make good use of your breast care nurse. She is there to help you and will be happy to answer any questions you may have. You can also get lots of help and support from this website, breastcancercare.org.uk and Maggiescentres.org. Best of luck with your surgery. Lorna x",
