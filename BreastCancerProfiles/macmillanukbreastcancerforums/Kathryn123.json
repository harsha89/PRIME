      "Content": "Hiya hun I am currently recovering from my second operation after my lumpectomy and have had my lymph nodes removed.  I was absolutely gutted when they told me just like you but you have to look at it as they are doing everything they can for you.  They do know what they are doing as much as we question it a lot.  I was much calmer the second time going to theatre and waking up.  I had a drain for 6 days which is a pain in the arse and annoying but not painful at all.  I went to see my surgeon on Thursday for my results and finally some good news after months of bad news.  The lymph nodes were clear, I thought I would feel cheated that I am having to go through pain and discomfort with my arm recovering from the op and there was no need for the op.  But I don't i am just grateful that they are clear and it could of.been a lot different if I hadn't had the operation.  I would never of forgiven myself if the cancer had spread and I hadn't done everything possible to remove it and live for my husband and three children.  If you want to message me please feel free.  Am here for you.  Kath xx ",

I used to have really long gorgeous curly hair and it's devastating to me to lose it, I can't look at photos anymore without crying and taken them all down.  But then I went for my wig fitting and I do absolutely love it.  If anyone else is struggling with this part of the treatment I hope that when you get your wig you will feel as happy as I do with mine. ",

      "Content": "Hiya hun  So I am in exact same boat as you and also feel like there are great big holes in it and I'm sinking.  I had 1 lymph node removed and it had cancer in it, I have opted for the operation and am going in for mine on 31st July which is my son's 15th birthday. (Am not happy)  I also don't do well with anaesethic and am really ill when i wake up and I have a collapsed right lung and major lung problems.  So for me another operation is a nightmare and a big risk but you know how I think, I HAVE TO DO EVERYTHÌNG TO GET RID OF THIS DAMN CANCER.  I owe it to my children to do everything offered to me. I would never forgive myself if i didnt do it and it spread.  Please message me if you want a chat.  Sending you a big hug  Kath xx ",
