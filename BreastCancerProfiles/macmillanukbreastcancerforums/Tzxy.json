      "Content": "Hi Oksana, I had a mastectomy and nose clearance in December (following WLE in Nov) had drains in for nearly 3 weeks. Shortly after I got swelling as you describe - was in A&E twice over Xmas as I then got an infection. The first surgeon who saw me dismissed me saying lymphodeama surely I knew this was a known side effect. Thankfully the second time I was in as now needed IV antibiotics a breast surgeon was on duty took control & drained 85ml from my Seroma. It has puffed a tiny bit since but is slowly going down. Worth getting a formal diagnosis so that it can be dealt with either way. Hope that helps! Good luck. Tzxy xx",

A good cry, a scream, shout or whatever it takes. I want to do all of these for you - I will if it helps :-) On a positive note they are looking to do something to sort out your lump/swelling and truly get you fully healed. Focus on a pain free outcome as your light at the end of the tunnel - there is light - your tunnel has just (frustratingly) been extended. I'm no practical help I know but hope the empathy helps.

I didn't have an easy ride pre-chemo but once they put the port in it was plain sailing for both giving blood and having chemo. Best decision ever! Slightly reluctant to let it go but I do need to book in to have it removed. We are all different so make the right call for you. Wishing you well Tzxy xx",

My advise is always have someone with you even if it is a hospital chaperone. It is always easier to defend someone else especially when you are not feeling on par. I didn't change my oncologist but I did change my surgeon. When you go back after a WLE to be told bad news what you don't need is the surgeon to burst into tears and say I'm sorry but I've never had to give anyone this much bad news before. I'm not saying the second operation went without a hitch but I felt in capable hands and reassured throughout.  When it comes to your care, your treatment, the impact on your life you need to be listened to and records accurate. I get you are all complained out so maybe try the GP approach so have someone focus on you rather than you having to fight & complain. Or see another oncologist and then their assessment will supersede what is on your file - focus on the positive which is restoring you. Hope you find the inner strength to resolve this and get the outcome you deserve. Tzxy xx",

I wasn't ambivalent to my breasts I loved them and always had they were a big part of the pre-C me. So felt very let down by my favourite booby (doesn't pay to have favourites). Because of this my husband and surgeon talked me into a therapeutic mammoplasty - one sided boob job with WLE.  I didn't like it! The results were great cosmetically (people pay good money for this) but it wasn't the same. I may have come around - I only had a fortnight before bombshell.  Needed further surgery and so went for the get rid option (no immediate reconstruction). Possible reconstruction is a decision I've decided to park for a rainy day in the future. Wearing a fake one is no problem at the moment as it is so cold and everything is under several layers but I'm thinking wardrobe for the summer may need some rethinking. Good luck! Tzxy xx",

The surgeons and oncologists are entitled to their medical opinions but at the end of the day they don't have to live with it or with the side effects of the treatments. Which if you're lucky are minimal but at the other extreme can destroy any quality of life.
