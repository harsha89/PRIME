My church were my biggest support but as people do they tend to go away at this stage considering that you are better. It's so hard to try to explain. No one who hasn't been through it can understand. I have nerve damage from tax chemo and dare not go out as I don't know day to day how far I can walk. I can bike but its hilly here and I am still weak. I feel for you. I do feel like a prisoner in my own house. I went shopping  with a friend to hold onto and looked at the people all shopping I so wished I could just go out alone like I used to. I am sure your friends would help if you have one special friend can you talk to them? It's hard but I guess you need to try to explain to someone. I send you love and agree this is the worst stage. When on chemo you get offers of help but no one understands that its a much longer struggle. God bless Trudi x",

In the middle week i just slept 3 days solid that was the main side effect the engulfing tiredness as blood cells drop. Don't fight it accept your body needs sleep in that middle period my blood hit its lowest at 10 days after chemo. Then 4 days before my second my energy came back. So I plan to get things done a few days after and before chemo and the middle week I rest as I am out of breath trying to walk up the stairs. The anti sickness drugs work well although do give me a bit of virtigo. I felt sick but have never actually been sick. After first one I find it is easier as you know what to expect. My love Truidi",

I suddenly was so angry and upset that I was sitting in the corner being ignored they seemed to have no thought for my feelings about me not being able to do any of these things. My sister said when I was diagnosed \"Your lucky you can have a boob job and a tummy tuck\" I was in shock - LUCKY !! I had chemoto go my right breast removed (left flat) radiotherapy and 17 herceptin ahead. I hate to feel angry and try to think they can enjoy what they do - it just felt so unsensitive especially as I now have neripheral nurology and my feet are so numb I can't even walk to the local shop. In fact my whole family just seem to avoid ever asking how I am or feeling. They just seem so unsensitive I felt so small slumpedin a chair feeling rough as had a long day for me wih them all igboring me. I really want a group in Felixstowe were I live but all the support groups are a few bus stops away too much for me. I am trying to stay positive but I have aged over the passed year my hair is still very short, dry skin and I am so thin my surgeon has said I need to put on weight to have a reconstruction. Also I am finding this site hard to navigate!! I have HER2 breast cancer hormone negative had 15 lymph nodes removed 8 had cancer and my arm seems so weak still I am winging and don't want to but at least recognition I am in the room would be nice Trudi x",

I keep looking up statists for my cancer to return which is a negative thing to do. It's like everyone expects me to be normal again and I have 15 herceptin to go and a year until I can have a reconstruction. Having one breast has suddenly got me so low. I feel like I should be stronger and fitter at this point but I feel awful. I am just emotionally falling apart. I cry all the time my sister is not talking to me as I brought up the subject of my cancer the other day and she was annoyed I think she feels I should just \"get over it, deal with it\" stop winging. I know she has thought all along its nothing and it will be easy for me so I deliberately avoid talking about it but I felt so low I mentioned it she just walked out not wanting to hear. She is the extreme but it seems everyone else too thinks by now I should be normal again and all the cards and support seem to of vanished. I cry because I feel so alone and scared to tell my family. But today I just had to say I can't do anything and go rest in bed or I'd of really pushed myself too far. Is this normal at this stage?? Anyone else experienced this terrible low nearing the end of Radiotherapy?? Any advice be so helpful.",

It all happened so fast diagnDoes 24/8/13 to l had cancer but NOT breast cancer  !! So had CT MRI & bone scan. Only for them to come back to the breast tried 2nd biopsy no results. Breast surgeon was 'highly suspicious' we're cancer was I had a to sign permission form for them to remove my breast & I wouldn't sue if found nothing. They did in ducts tiny area considering 8 nodes were cancerous. I have had FEC-T ch.emotherapy. 3 FEC 3 TAX.  First 3 were not to bad. Bearable. Then whofen I started second 3 the Taxotere I got a. Shock it's far worse. Not wanting to scare you  But lots of people say same. Be prepared In case you too find it tough. Get aqueous cream for washing canister cream for itchy skin. I didn't and had to crawl to my GP for some. Skin gets very dry and I had a purple rash were bruising and bleeding under my skin and big lumps under skin. Caneston stopped itching and I could sleep although I had itched my skin raw. I then was out for 4 days solid. The tiredness is overwhelming so ask for help around house as you (if like me) will be asleep and nothing can rouse you. Enjoy this sleep part. You may be fine on Tax only telling you my experience. I cried as the line was put in for my final one. That was 21st May. My skin looked 10 years older lost 3/4 of my nails. Eyelashes fell out making my eyes sore. I tried false eyelashes but if you wear eyeliner no one notices.  You soon get skin tone back MY eyelashes grew back quite soon. I did shave  head as first time it grew was white and long round side with a few long dark hairs on top I looked stupid!!! But then it grew evenly and dark but seems curly. I now have full eyelashes all body hair and my head hair is about 3-4 cm long. I dyed it pink your NOT SUPPOSED TO DYE HAIR TILL IT IS 4 inches!!! I thought what the he'll (excuse my phrase) be not long before I get a haircut. I bought lots of wigs from Amazon as my NHS one went bald and course. At first I had fun with different wigs but decided I don't need to hide so I just went out bald. I felt so free. I actually quite liked the bald look it suited me (when I was looking better) I have peripheral nurology numb hands and feet so keep an eye out and if you start to get numbness tell your oncologists straight away. Mine came on 2 months after. Now I can't walk far. This is a rare side effect but look out for signs. It will ease I'm told but I might have it for life. Also radiotherapy is so easy compared to chemotherapy. I enjoyed my radiotherapy visits. But I hit. A low and suddenly was scared cancel would come back. I felt so alone everyone had stopped sending cards/flowers and offering to help. This is normal and very common. You realise that your still recovering and need to go slow. Others think oh she's had chemo/radiotherapy she's better. You can't explain to them how you feel no one who has not been through it doesn't understand. Sorry I went on that's me lol oh on herceptin 17 _10 down 8 to go. I've had few side effects from it but not much and most people are fine on it. Love thinking of you. Hope I helped. In my prayers.

      "Content": "Hi I just wanted to talk to people who understand. All my family and friends think I am 'better' and I can just get over it jump up and move on forget it ever happened. I can't I hate to mention that I still have pain in my arm where all my lymph nodes were removed still just one huge breast and just been told NHS can not do a reconstruction as would never match so no pioint. My surgeon is going to apply on psychological grounds as I am still fairly young (44) with 2 kids aged 10 and 11 and their friends do not want to see me with one breast but the fake thing is so uncomfortable so I did buy a lightweight breast that is much easier to wear. I will never take my top off not even in front of my husband. My hair grew back so awful curly and a bit rough not like it was so I cut it all off again look a bit like a shorter cut Annie Lennox I miss my thick dark hair. When I got up in morning I looked like Tom Jones on a bad hair day. I feel very tearful today. Husband is at good food show all day kids spend all day on PS4 and Xbox. I have 2 loads wash to do all the ironing and then try to tackle cleaning as it got so bad while I was ill. I was refused any benefits and my poor hubby couldn't do everything he did provide our tea he loves to cook anyway. But he is not good at cleaning and I do not hold that against him he did what he could. My mum and sister showed no support help or understanding I feel a bit angry at them and don't want to feel that. Mum was so ashamed I was bald so thinking of shaving it all off as I liked it and everyone else said how beautiful I looked it did suit me. But do not want to do it in spite as I can not hold feelings like that I only hurt myself. I am sitting here on my computer reading patronising emails from my mum (only way she ever contacts me) my sister said I am lucky it is a breeze and get a free boob job!!!! how on earth can she think that amazing. I know I have to get wash and ironing done help kids do homework. I must get this house tidy. Over last 3 months trying to deep clean rooms but then I get bouts of pain and weakness again. I love my garden and it makes me sad it has been left to just go to pot. My husband did prune the most important things but no weeding, cutting back more pruning and plants to pot on in greenhouse my rabbit needs a good clean but even that hurts my arm. Wish we could of afforded a cleaner and gardener for a while keep on top of it all. Anyway those things are not important. I paint but have no time now as trying to manage the home and garden takes all day. But I am alive I do have a faith but it's hard to hold on to it. You all know people say how great you look how strong you are and amazing always still smiling but at home alone I have cried many tears. I hope this will wear off. I just want people to know I will never be the same I will always need to ease up on my life. I just hate mum patronizing me going on about she knew so and so who had cancer they never winged mentioned it looked amazing and are totally recovered now they have just got up and back on as before. Ha bum to that she didn't see the pain and tears. Well so sorry but no where else to turn. Has anyone felt the same? has anyone with a full lymph removal found their arms still weak?? I try to lift weights as lost so much muscle then pain comes again at times have to rest. It's a no win situation. If anyone can relate or understand please tell me I am not the only one who cries and struggles with other people. Thank you Trudi",

The test was inconclusive but highly suspicious of cancer.  I have HER2 cancer if you heard of it 19% people seem have the HEr2 receptor.

However doctor gave me antibiotics and all cleared up. I am sure on your foot will be fine, I didn't realze that my neck was so vunerable as my right arm was wher had 15 nodes removed. Oncologist said radiotherapy targeted the lymph nodes under my collar bone which can take a year to heal and return to normal. She told me in time my body will adjust and my arm will have some innunity but I have to always watch that arm. I found a wrist band you can wear that acts as an insect repellant each one lasts 120 hours only £1 for 2 bands. So much easier than carrying around a tube of insect repellent and protects all of your body. I got mine from SAVERS in a green box sorry can't think of the brand name now but if you have not heard of them try one so easy - yellow and not the most attractive bracelet I admit but works definately.

I just went with my cancer team at hospital and I had right breast mastectomy and 15/20 lymph nodes removed (8 wete full of cancer) Initially where cancer came fromm seemed conduse my breast surgeon. I am hormone - but HER2 + They found an 8mm pre cancer area in the breast. If I had not had a mastectomy it would of never been found til it had spread. I believe God works through doctors and NHS professionals please don't be afraid. Here I am one breast bald but at least I have an idea of when chemo and treatment will end. If I had refused op. I would still have that cancer growing and spreading. I was well only sign was lump under my arm. I am Trudi by the way. Good luck with your decision I personally think go with surgery. You at least may still keep your breast. I lost mine but I would loose a leg if it meant I will see my 2 kids grow up. It is hard I know. Think of it this way sooner its out and tested. Sooner you can get treatment and get well. Good luck I mean it thinking of you. Trudi",

      "Content": "Hi I am Trudi, Waiting is the hardest part think I nearly had a nervous break down as my doctor started looking for cancer everywhere (I had a cancerous lump under my arm) just get my results out. Found them lol I have ductal (the type in milk ducts) nodes 8/15 meaning of the 15 lymph nodes they removed 8 had cancer in, 18mm of pre invasive cancer in right breast which is gone now only got the left one!! Margins clear (think means only in my ducts) Grade 2, hormone negative but HER2 positive (which is not your standard breast cancer as no hormones involved instead I am a 1 in 10 who has this protein receptor called HER2 which once cancer forms locks on and stimulates its growth rate. Hence seeing 'invasive, aggressive' which was scary. Your doctor doesn't seem that supportive? my surgeon and oncologist have been great I had a lot to learn as even though did my A level biology this HER2 was only found 13 years ago 3 years ago herceptin was licensed for use to kill it. Cancer seems to be different for us all and a clear explination in a user friendly format from the doctor is vital I think. I was told at first \"You have cancer but not breast cancer\" looking back maybe the surgeon should not have made such a statement until my biopsy was re-tested. I was thinking agh is in lung? live? kidney? blood? lymph? so on a rollercoaster. Praying for you thinking of you (I mean it) at this hard time. Stay positive, and I hope the results are clear and not too bad. All my Love let me know on 13th what they say. Putting a dampener on Christmas for you I expect. Trudi xxxxxxxxxxxx",

      "Content": "I don't want to dishearten you but I applied in August 13 twice medical examiner didn't show up. Third she was very of fish with me. Got a letter saying I was not entitled to PIP I appealed. Kept phoning. Both McMillan and my MP have written to the DWP on my behalf. Today they eventually phoned. The lady said decision was now being sent to me. I could tell by her tone it is a no!!!!! Now I have to clean 9 months worth of grime from my house. Garden has not been tended. If PIP payed out I could of hired a cleaner and gardener. I was a full time mum that may be why as I didn't work or was on any other benefit. They overlook my job was housework gardening and washing, ironing. Plus taking care of my children. At last they have had a haircut I was too ill to take them to the hairdresser. I feel fairly hard done by. If emotions from cancer weren't enough the stress of needing to clean but am still weak is mounting to overload. Good luck hope you get yours soon Trudi x",

      "Content": "Hi Mandy, I am very emotional reading how you sadly lost your mum. My mum has in fact not been there for me she is very hot on appearances and when I was at my illest she made me put my wig and fake breast on and make up. So her attitude has been more hurtful than supportful. So sorry you lost your mum. I lost my dad in 2002 but not to cancer. I am finished chemo and radiotherapy but still a year of herceptin injections and a reconstruction as I am flat on the right and have this large breast on the left. I was so strong through chemo but towards end of radiotheerapy every emotion possible hit me. Now people ecpect me to be 'better'and I hurt inside. You will get through the tratment I did, taxotere chemo did knock me out and I was asleep 4 days solid!!! I cut my hair off so I wouldn't see it fall out and surprisingly I look ok bald. I had hair growing bac in patches but shaved it off to grow more evenly. I am brave enough to just be me now no wig I just go out with a more or less bald head. Everyone has been fine. I will be thinking of you and remember it won't last long a few months and out of your life that isn't much. Wishing you love Trudi",
