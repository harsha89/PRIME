    "Content": "Hello all,  Just looking for a bit of advice and reassurance. I had my mammogram 2 weeks ago(I'm 41 and because of my family history I started having them last year). They found a mass and I had a core biopsy last week. I always check myself and I can't feel what they found.  Had my letter for my follow up appointment today and it's from general surgery appointments but within the breast clinic. I'm trying not overthink things, but does this mean they want to remove it, is it cancer? I'm trying not to get to wound up, but I'm worried. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!  Thank you all so much x ",
