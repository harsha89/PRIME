I suppose you have 2 choices. Dump him or try to \"work it out\" with relate. So he's been unfaithful twice then? In October and February? A couple of questions that might help you. Could you forgive him for being unfaithful to you while you were going through treatment for breast cancer?  Could you see a future with a husband who you can not trust and has let you down in your darkest hour? Could you live with the stress and worry that he will be unfaithful to you again?   Does he love you?  I believe that unfaithfulness is not a weakness because a man is \"stressed\". I believe that they choose to do it and it is NOT YOUR FAULT. I am no expert so perhaps the best thing would be to speak to one. You need to look after yourself.  I am so sorry. ",

My boyfriend ( we don't live together and I mainly visited him because I have 2 teenage girls, say no more! ) was very supportive to begin with but now I think it's all become to much for him as he is finding more overtime to do etc all the classic signs of withdrawing. My daughters are also \"acting up\" a lot more now. ( Their father died of a heart attack 7 years ago). They were very rude when he last visited. They can be quite hurtful. Which is very shocking. The cancer, mastectomy and chemo are not getting me down its my homelife! ",

So it seems that a little withdrawal from my boyfriend is normal only time will tell. People say that I'm positive, strong  and I'm doing really well. I think its because its happening to me. I lost a boob, haven't really missed it. I had a reconstruction same time. My hair is falling out. It'll grow back. I know how the yucky chemo days feel. I know I'll get through it. BUT it must be very,very scary to watch all of this happening to a loved one. I am so sorry I feel for you. It's worse I'm sure. I suppose the best advice I could give Sarah, would be to just be there for him. Don't let him feel lonely. Go to the appointments together. Make that special snack on yucky chemo days. Lots of love and hugs. My daughters are acting up because they are teenagers and I'm not myself.  School have been very good and have a social worker who is spending time with them. They have been good today.  I feel very positive thank you all. Lots of love and hugs from me xx     ",

My surgeon used a silicone implant which was placed under the chest muscle.It feels and looks very natural, with actual feelings to the touch, in the top half of the breast. I can lie on my tummy and the tissue around it looks natural.  My cleavage in a bra is excellent. Looks normal. ( 38DD ) I am very pleased with it. Even so my surgeon has offered me a lift and slight reduction to the unaffected breast to even them up a bit. ( I didn't realize how far south they had gone lol). I have been offered a nipple and tattoo as well! I have full movement and swim. I am back in work but not allowed to lift anything heavy. I hope that my experience is of help to you. As each N.H.S trust is different it may be good for you to discuss your options with your breast care nurse.  Good luck and take care. ",

I was in a similar position to you four months ago. Node was clear and er+ . I made the choice to have Chemo because the oncologist had said there was a very slight chance that cancer cells could escape into the blood stream and spread that way.  So in my mind I needed to prevent that and throw everything at it they were offering. I'm a single parent of two teenagers ( their father died 8 years ago). So I still need to be around for them and plus I  want to enjoy retirement!  I suppose I made the choice because I wanted peace of mind that I have done everything to get rid of this cancer.

So my girls did not have too much of a shock I wore little caps at first.

I am one of those woman who at this moment in time who has chosen the very tried and tested, conventional route and is trying to \"come to terms\" with the side effects plus the loss of a breast and my hair. WHY go down this path? Because I want to live. I want the best chance I can get for myself and my family. I'll fight for that and go through the hardship of leaving my \"immune system to deal with the after effects , if it can\". I turn to this site as I know I am not alone.There are some lovely ladies here who have given me some very helpful advice as I travel down this route. They all mean well and have every ones best interests at heart.  When I sat with my breast care team and oncologist to discuss my treatment not once did I feel that they were giving me the cheaper, cost effective version. Thank goodness for the N.H.S. If I had to pay for all of my treatments I would be dead!  ",

She's no expert.  Go back to work when you feel you can. My G.P signed me off for as long as I wanted. (6 months in my case). I know some woman have taken a year out. Be kind to yourself.",

      "Content": "Hi Carriek, I've had a mastectomy and reconstruction with an inplant.  I'm starting chemo tomorrow so advised to have an uplift and reduction on the other breast at a later date. It should be a better match when the inplant has settled down.  I was able to get a lot of advice from my surgeon and breast care nurse ( She should be able to tell you what your surgeon is qualified to do ) . But in the end the decision is only ours.  For myself the one wound, pain and \"clipped wing\" on one side was enough to deal with at the time. I was happier with a quicker recovery time for my own peace of mind! I hope my experience and that of lots of others here can be of help for you to make your decision?",

      "Content": "Hi Ladies has anyone had any experience with dating after breast cancer? After discussion with some male friends/colleagues,  I have concluded that  a man would like to know from the start if a women has had a mastectomy etc etc.  Female colleagues say don't put anything like that on my profile. It will scare them off! To be honest if they are going to be scared off. I would sooner it be before I met them!  When and how do you tell a man that you have had a mastectomy? I'm on tamoxifen and I think a sex life is going to be difficult.  Any suggestion?",

      "Content": "Hi Wendy. I had a mastectomy / immediate reconstruction with a silicon implant. 31st Aug last year and I haven't looked back! ( Only I had my 4 Tax after ). When I woke up from surgery, I still had a cleavage. that was important to me and my surgeon knew it. I'm very pleased with his work. ( I'm a 38DD ). The 1st week was a bit rough. I needed to be propped up in bed to sleep. ( couldn't sleep on my side). I also needed regular painkillers and had the drain in for a week.  By the 2nd week I was driving and went to a fancy dress beach party! ( I did sit a lot and drank orange juice to be on the safe side).  Like you say we are all different. I hope very much that everything goes smoothly for you to get to your daughters wedding. What a lovely event to look forward to after treatment! Take care.    ",
