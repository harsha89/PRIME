    "Content": "I had my latest 'catch up' with my oncologist yesterday and am just wondering if anyone else has appointments that last about 5 mins, if that? I go in, she then asks me what cycle I'm on and when my next one is due - I assumed she would perhaps looks at my notes and know this? I then had to remind her I had had an MRI the previous week - that she had ordered?! - she just said 'oh yeah that looked fine'Â  She then flies through a tick chart of side effects, not really giving me a chance to go into any detail. She then prods my boob - after I had reminded her what boob had the lumps and where they were. Thrusts a blood form into my face and tells me she'll see me in 3 weeks time. I walked out and promptly burst into tears, this is what happens every time?? I've had 4 appointments with her now and they are all the same. I understand they are probably very busy, but I don't feel I am allowed time to ask anything. I've got side effects that are really getting me down but don't know who to speak to about them - I assumed it would the oncologist but obviously not?? Is this par for the course? I feel like a I want to ask for different Oncologist, but at the same time, I don't want to 'rock the boat' halfway through my Chemo.",
