      "Content": "Hello Carolyn, I thought I'd replied to you but obviously not. I am going to see the Oncologist , who I do have faith in, on the 9th October. He asked to see me before but typically I'm going to a music concert and Its been booked for 7 months I'm not giving that up. Anyway the upshot is that my body has decided that the Foob I have on my left side is not healing, its now leaking in a different place, so really I decided that with Chemo it will definitely not heal at the moment I can see a light at the end of the tunnel. The drs want to help and make sure that they offer the full gold star treatment but for some people it doesn't work. Everyone's body is different and everyone want to try different things. So really that's my theory and I'll ask for the next plan after no chemo and see what they say. How are you doing Chloecat? Thanks Fran",

      "Content": "Hi Chloecat45, I wanted to join in your discussion it was highlighted to me because I like you want to say no to chemo. I was been really uplifted to read your story and you are managing it. I have to admit i try to do research but my memory can't hold much information  and I forget a lot of details which is probably why my research for my particular BC has not been good. I just wanted to give you a brief synopsis of my story( if you are interested) I was dx in 2011 when I was 39 I followed all the treatments because that's what I thought you had to do. I had a lumpectomy followed by lymph node removal. I had grade 3 idc 8/8 and her2 neg. then I had chemo this is when everything went wrong, I was ill everytime ended up in hospital the whole time and only managed 4 EC . The oncs didn't listen to me when I said I wasn't well but went ahead with they 4th then I got meningitis shingles and a chest infection I nearly died. I was so ill it was very traumatic. Then I had 20 seas of radiotherapy . After that I went on tamoxifen for 5 years.  Fast forward to 2017 discovered the brca1 gene was in the family and I have it so prepared myself for a double mastectomy and ovaries out.  However a week after finding out I had the gene the yearly mammogram showed 2 tumours idc again grade 2 and grade 3. I had an LD recon on the 11th July. This has not gone well and as I'm writing my wounds are leaking.  Now the Drs wanted me to have chemo again but Ive said no due to wound heals and also because the tumours have gone and it's given just in case there are any invisible cells.  Ive had a bone scan and ct scan all clear.  Ive got till the 9th oct to decide. The onc said things like how will you feel it is comes back and is incurable. So that's my story I do t want chemo I'm not having it. Any advice would be good ",
