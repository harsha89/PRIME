I feed three feral's and very rewarding it is to see their furry faces each day. Good luck with the cream on your skin :) I am glad I am not the only one falling out with so called friends after being diagnosed with cancer and sort of expecting support from friends.  As well as my five wonderful cat friends I also feed the ungrateful farm cat that was abandoned by the two previous owners. I say ungrateful because she tries to rip your hand off if you try to touch her. Which is why the last two people abandoned her, and I took over providing for her.  I tell her she's an ungrateful cat. But then what right have people got to expect her to like them just because they feed her.  Which is why I had to get rid of the car two years ago when it fell to bits. Was it keep the car and get rid of the cats and stop feeding the ungrateful farm cat, and the even more ungrateful wild birds who hate me and leave bird poo all over my outside chair. They all decided the car had to go. Now a dog would have shown gratitude. But did the cats? Well I'll let you work that one out!",

I am someone who likes to do my research, and it's frustrating when someone just spouts a bit of opinionated claptrap. I would love it if people just asked me questions (and some of my friends do) or just asked how I was feeling and were prepared to listen to the answer. I am lucky that I found this site early, and I come on here when I feel that no one else really gets it. As yet I have not really 'contributed', just asked questions and had a bit of a whinge, and everyone's been lovely.  I hope the rest of your treatment goes well, and that you and the cats make some good, new friends, as life returns to a new normal. With love Lizz X  Hi Liz. Well I thought it made me into a moaner when I talked about people I had fallen out with because of the way they treated me without actually wanting to listen to me. It takes the anger out of how I started to feel towards people when I hear people on the community have had similar problems. What really made me want to punch someone was when I was told I had been given cancer for a reason. I had been given it to teach me something. A lesson to learn. If only people would think what they were saying before opening their mouths.",

Why couldn't they just ask, instead of telling me how I should feel. Why couldn't they read booklets, or even google it. But no, they just wanted to control me. One friend who had been a friend for nineteen years even had to write a nasty letter to make sure I got the point that she was in the right, and I should listen to her as she knew best. To begin with I was hurt, and blamed myself for not covering up my emotions that had started to break free. Now I just think stuff the lot of them. I actually am relieved to be free of them and their controlling ways. ",

I am a great believer in positive thinking and healthy eating but sometimes you just want to be miserable or angry and eat crap. I get really fed up of people telling me inspirational stories about how someone beat cancer just by eating brocolli and meditating.  My friends have been mostly supportive but I have dropped a few - one  told me that now I have cancer no one will want to date me (like that's a priority) and I'd basically die alone riddled with tumours and get eaten by the cat (ok so I exaggerate a little).  I have found this site invaluable. There always seems to be someone who knows exactly what you are going through. Wow Fi. That is how I feel. All the inspirational stories about broccoli etc. I am sure someone was cured by eating broccoli. But what about all the other millions that weren't.  On a lighter note. There seems to be a few animal lovers here on this site. I hope this photo comes through properly. If not perhaps someone will tell me how to do it. Size etc. Last night in the early hours I discovered I had a new pet. A baby kangaroo. A little Joey snuggled in his pouch. If this doesn't come out people are going to think me crazy!",

Thank goodness for red cross or else I would not be able to get to have treatment. Well that's about it.

Sick of people saying they had a friend who had cancer and they were able to do this, that, and the other. And people telling me I'd be fine, then changing the subject. I am normally a very laid back person who agrees with people to keep the peace. But the cancer made me touchy to start with. So I lost all my friends by telling them it wouldn't be the cancer, or the treatment that would kill me, but people stressing me out. Now I just have five cats to support me through this, who don't deliberately upset me. I was fine doing it on my own.

But after a couple of FEC chemos my bloods were really poor due I think mainly to all the D & V. They had already delayed the second chemo and and the NHS transport you have to ring are really hateful and I dreaded keep ringing them and changing appointments. I had been told I couldn't have transport for pre assessments, only for the chemo. I told them they were giving me a death sentence as without the pre assessment I couldn't have the chemo. Their answer was would I like the chemo transport cancelled then. After a long story the cancer centre stepped in and made the NHS transport people give me transport for all my appointments. But I dreaded ringing them as they made me feel I wasn't deserving of transport. So I decided to make myself eat every thing I could in order to get my bloods back up so as I could have the chemo and not have to change the transport dates. I rang up the hospital at one point and told them I was giving up my treatment because of the hassle over transport.. Lucky for me I got a really caring patient nurse who persuaded me I must carry on. Anyhow, back to the point of this post. I decided to go back to vegetarianism so as to have more choice of foods and boiled myself a couple of eggs. I couldn't eat them. Or anything else containing eggs however disguised. I did during chemo find all food tasted disgusting, or had a metallic taste. But now I have got most of my taste back, I still can't touch eggs. Has anyone else found a problem with certain foods whilst having chemo?",

It must have been so stressful having this additional worry on top of your diagnosis. I'm glad you had the support of a caring nurse to get you through.  What a pain it must be finding out a food you previously loved now seems to be off limits. I think a lot of people find that chemo affects their sense of taste. I haven't any experience of it myself but noticed you hadn't had any replies yet to your question so didn't want you to think no one was listening.  I've had a quick look on the net,  and  while I haven't found anything that specifically mentions eggs, I  came across this information on our site here at Macmillan about changes in taste which might be of some use? Breast Cancer Care have an online forum and lots of information too that you may like to look at. Cancer Research UK also have some information on it. Hope some of this is of use. I'm sure you will get some replies from people who have gone through the same thing and can share their personal experiences.  Meanwhile, take care. Hugs Sue x Thank you so much for finding useful links for me Sue. I wouldn't have bothered, it was just that one of the Red Cross drivers said she had come across people that had a problem with eggs, and some with potatoes after chemo. So I thought I would ask.  I am not the only one having a struggle with transport to appointments. The Red Cross used to deal with it all. But now patients have to ring a NHS number who then try to stop you having transport. I have heard some awful tales about people being refused transport. If you can then convince them you really do have to have transport they then send details onto the Red Cross whose drivers then contact you. But if you manage to be able to book transport, they only let you book one week at a time. It's a real battle. I am sure they are only doing their job by trying to weed out people that don't really need the hospital transport. But it's very stressful for those that have no other way of getting to have their treatment.",

      "Content": "I have been vegetarian since I was 15. When I was diagnosed with breast cancer I went vegan. But after a couple of FEC chemos my bloods were really poor due I think mainly to all the D & V. They had already delayed the second chemo and and the NHS transport you have to ring are really hateful and I dreaded keep ringing them and changing appointments. I had been told I couldn't have transport for pre assessments, only for the chemo. I told them they were giving me a death sentence as without the pre assessment I couldn't have the chemo. Their answer was would I like the chemo transport cancelled then. After a long story the cancer centre stepped in and made the NHS transport people give me transport for all my appointments. But I dreaded ringing them as they made me feel I wasn't deserving of transport. So I decided to make myself eat every thing I could in order to get my bloods back up so as I could have the chemo and not have to change the transport dates. I rang up the hospital at one point and told them I was giving up my treatment because of the hassle over transport.. Lucky for me I got a really caring patient nurse who persuaded me I must carry on. Anyhow, back to the point of this post. I decided to go back to vegetarianism so as to have more choice of foods and boiled myself a couple of eggs. I couldn't eat them. Or anything else containing eggs however disguised. I did during chemo find all food tasted disgusting, or had a metallic taste. But now I have got most of my taste back, I still can't touch eggs. Has anyone else found a problem with certain foods whilst having chemo?",

      "Content": "suze99 Hello I'm so sorry to hear you had such a battle to get transport for your appointments. That is shocking. It must have been so stressful having this additional worry on top of your diagnosis. I'm glad you had the support of a caring nurse to get you through.  What a pain it must be finding out a food you previously loved now seems to be off limits. I think a lot of people find that chemo affects their sense of taste. I haven't any experience of it myself but noticed you hadn't had any replies yet to your question so didn't want you to think no one was listening.  I've had a quick look on the net,  and  while I haven't found anything that specifically mentions eggs, I  came across this information on our site here at Macmillan about changes in taste which might be of some use? Breast Cancer Care have an online forum and lots of information too that you may like to look at. Cancer Research UK also have some information on it. Hope some of this is of use. I'm sure you will get some replies from people who have gone through the same thing and can share their personal experiences.  Meanwhile, take care. Hugs Sue x Thank you so much for finding useful links for me Sue. I wouldn't have bothered, it was just that one of the Red Cross drivers said she had come across people that had a problem with eggs, and some with potatoes after chemo. So I thought I would ask.  I am not the only one having a struggle with transport to appointments. The Red Cross used to deal with it all. But now patients have to ring a NHS number who then try to stop you having transport. I have heard some awful tales about people being refused transport. If you can then convince them you really do have to have transport they then send details onto the Red Cross whose drivers then contact you. But if you manage to be able to book transport, they only let you book one week at a time. It's a real battle. I am sure they are only doing their job by trying to weed out people that don't really need the hospital transport. But it's very stressful for those that have no other way of getting to have their treatment.",

I have had six lots of chemo, and 15 lots of radiotherapy as well as surgery. I am now on herceptin and letrozole. For me I felt I have made the right decision by accepting all the help I can be given. Doctors and nurses choose this profession because they want to save lives. I also feel with all the steps forward scientist are making to finding a cure for cancer, that even if the treatment I am having now doesn't work, there will be a treatment that will if I get to that stage. In the meantime I feel if I am strong enough to get through all the treatment, then I am strong enough to beat this cancer. ",

You end up telling people around you that you are alright, it ends up easier that way.

But of course this started around the same time as starting the herceptin and then letrozole as well. It's gone on for so long, just over a year that I can't remember the exact time it started. But it makes sense now that it is the letrozole causing it. I saw the oncologist last Tuesday for a check up. She made no mention of letrozole causing it, just said go to your GP if it gets worse!

      "Content": "Hi Sue. I was diagnosed in November 2016. had surgery, chemo, was ER. and HER2 positive. I had horrendous diarrhoea with the FEC. Not so bad with the Docetaxol. But continued having loose stools that are not really diarrhoea, but two or three times a day I need to get to the toilet quick. I always have to put on a pad for safety when I go for hospital appointments. I also take imodium before I go. I blamed nerves for a while when the chemo stopped and there was no reason for the loose stools. But after radiotherapy finished on the 15th June and no more hospital appointments until the 12th July, I couldn't blame stress. So I have been blaming the letrozole which I started with the fourth lot of herceptin. I can't take pain killers for all the back and joint pain, again blamed on the letrozole. I get stomach ache and indigestion that is worse than the pain. At least the pain goes if I sit or lie down, but the stomach ache and indigestion gets worse and lasts for at least 24 hours. I wake up feeling sick each morning which usually is gone by midday. Again blaming the letrozole. But perhaps the three weekly herceptin has silently been causing the problem. But I'm really not sure. I have had so much treatment I really don't know what is causing the loose stools. So sorry I'm not much help really. ",

      "Content": "All my hair fell out within ten days after the first chemo. I had long hair down to my bottom and my hair had always been my safety comfort zone. It felt good to have it hanging around me. It made me feel like me. What annoyed me was the stupid things people would say. Tales about someone they knew whose hair grew back curly, and a different colour. Those telling me I should colour it purple or pink when it grew back. WHY? And those dummies who knew of someone whose hair never grew back at all. And was I going to get a wig. Get stuffed. Time and time again you would get the stupid remarks. Which is why they got their marching orders out of my life. What annoys me about the advert people are discussing is the fact the participants are not even bald. They have had a short crew cut which is an accepted form of hair cut. I was totally bald. It made me look, and feel like an ugly little old person that had to hide herself away from life, and only feel comfortable around people at the chemo centre where no one took any notice of me because they all knew how it felt. Now the hair is starting to grow slowly back, and I can see the ugly little old person starting to disappear. But what won't disappear is the hurt people inflicted on me with their thoughtless hair jokes at a time when I was at my most vulnerable. ",

But I am always open to the fact that there may be a diet out there that really can cure cancer. But I am very suspicious of sugar being cut out, and replaced with some other miracle substance so you can still eat sweet things. Most of them actually contain more sugar than refined sugar itself. And hardly any have any clinical backing behind them. When a study was done on honey most of them contained very little real honey. Just sugar and anti biotics and sold as real honey. But to be fair, I will take a proper look at Dr. Johanna Budwigs website and diet. I only skimmed over it and was put off when I saw the sugar alternative. I have read about flaxseed and cottage cheese as a cure for cancer in dogs. But there again, no clinical research details. But I think everything is worth a look at. The cure is out there somewhere!",

Being ER. and HER2 positive scared me, and it wasn't until I started waking up each morning during chemo and being disappointed I hadn't died in the night, that I decided that if the cancer came back, I wouldn't have chemo again. Or for that matter any other invasive aggressive treatment that poisons me to within an inch of my life.

      "Content": "chloecat45 Hi Hedgewitch Good for you, girl!  I'm all for empowerment.  Just to put the cat amongst the pigeons I saw another video which recommends conventional (surgery) and alternative for better results.  They feel like me that chemo and radiotherapy are dinosaurs of the past - they do more harm than good.  Complimentary therapies like acupuncture are good as is yoga, reiki, massage, etc.  Getting good sleep (in total dark) is too.  Fixing your diet, exercise, environmental factors, stress management, etc., also contribute to mental and physical wellbeing.  But you don't have to wait.  Start doing them now. ... still fighting this nasty little critter.... Hi Chloecat45. I wish I had been brave enough not to have had the chemo and radiotherapy, just the surgery. But I didn't have the courage. As we all know, the treatment for cancer has basically stayed the same for decades. Surgery, followed by chemo and radiotherapy. I have read both sides of the argument from conventional doctors, to those supporting the alternative approach.  I do believe the harsh treatments from conventional medicine leads to a lot of deaths. But I did hear one bit of sense from a conventional doctor. He said that most people won't stick to alternative treatment because it takes too much effort. Especially when it comes to diet. Following a vegan, sugar free diet is probably very hard for most people. That is why most people prefer to just sit and have their chemo and radiotherapy and let someone do it for them. I did see some truth in what he said. You have to be dedicated to go alternative, and totally believe in what you are doing. I took the middle road, by doing both. Although there is probably a lot of bad reviews about John Kelly's book, I did find it inspiring as he went along the lines of recommending a vegan and sugar free diet to his patients.But to have the chemo and radiotherapy as well. ",

I hardly got home from the hour journey from the hospital without having an accident. I had it for ten days up to 15- 20 times a day. Then it did slow down as I took more and more imodium.  And the second chemo was delayed for a week as I lost a stone in weight due to not only the diarrhoea, but sickness as well. They told me that a few people have an enzyme missing, which only shows up when you have  chemo. It gives you the diarrhoea constantly, but you never know if you have this missing enzyme unless you have the chemo. I had to wear ginormous pads and live on imodium. It should have stopped as soon as I started the T part of the chemo. But I was so fearful of it happening that anxiety would set it off the day of treatment. Even now for every appointment I take an imodium just in case. I have never had bowel problems before. But fear of what happened with the chemo has trained my bowels to play up any time I leave for the hospital.  There is a bit about it in this link.  news.cancerconnect.com/.../",

Number seven I blamed on the nurse slamming it in quickly and and saying \"yes it does sting badly\" when it hit me like a bee sting and I winced and had to stop myself leaping up. It stung badly for hours and that night I had what I thought was a large bruise and swelling. I measured the bruise so as I had a base line to go on as to whether it got worse overnight. It measured six and a half inches across. The swelling under it went from the side of my thigh from my knee, to hip. It pitted when I put my finger on it. I took pain killers to try to sleep and next morning the dark mark what I thought was a bruise had turned red, and the surrounding swelling was less. So I didn't do anything about it and a couple of days later things were back to normal. I was dreading the injection this time, but luckily it was a different nurse. I told her I had had a reaction the time before and she said she would do it slowly. It did sting a bit to start with, but nothing too bad. But afterwards the area went red and swelled up. Only about three inches across and no further stinging. Now tonight it is up again swelling from knee to hip on outside of thigh with pitting when touched. There is no dark, or red mark now. I have been having a lot of problem with oedema. Every time I do something like a lot of hoovering, or gardening my chest and top of arm areas swell. Also most of the time my ankles are swollen. I have mentioned it, but am told it's the letrozole, or the herceptin. I had an echo a month ago and it was fine. I didn't want to bother people, but it is beginning to worry me a bit. ",

      "Content": "Thank you every body for the useful info. Carolyn I only had three nodes removed. All clear. I am doing too much like you suggest as next day when I have been doing strenuous things everything swells up, and I'm in a lot of pain. So I have made myself slow down. I feel compelled all the time to get things sorted. I want to get everything in order. I have felt so ill for so many months, now I feel better I want to do things. But my body rebels. As soon as the nurse had gone after giving me the herceptin I went outside hacking a large bush down for an hour. No wonder the leg came up like it did. I do blame the letrozole for all the chest and scars swelling and pain, arm and legs and ankle swelling. But as all the other side effects have died down, I had hoped the swelling and joint pain would. But I guess I don't give it much of a chance. I just wish I didn't have this compulsion to just sort and throw away, and clean everywhere. And this urge to completely rip everything out of my garden and start again. I normally only clean up if someone is coming. And as for the garden, I used to tell people I had let it grow wild for the wildlife. ",

      "Content": "I went for my echo scan and assessment on Tuesday because I am on herceptin. I have also been on letrozole since middle of May. I have been having a lot of problems with it and asked if I carried on having the problems with side effects could it be changed to something else. I was told it could be changed. But because I was HER2 positive I should try to stick with the letrozole because if there are tumours else where it would shrink them. I had surgery end of November 2015 and some nodes taken out. The nodes were clear. But I was told even though nothing showed up, it only takes one seed to pass the nodes and cancer could set up anywhere. So stick with the letrozole. Now my hospital treatment is good, they are a great team. But I have been told some odd things at times that have turned out not to be true. So I am just wondering how true it is that letrozole shrinks tumours other than breast tumours.",

      "Content": "Thanks George and Lynn for the information. I keep hoping the aches and pains will improve. All the other side effects have. But my movement is getting worse. I walk each day and do gardening and try to fight the pain and stiffness. I keep telling myself I have only been on the letrozole for a couple of months. I'm not sure if the herceptin is adding to the problem. But never mind, if it gets unbearable I will try harder to get it changed to something else, like anastrozole Lynn mentioned she's on. I'm not being a baby over the stiffness and pain. This time last year I was riding horses all over the moors. This morning I couldn't even climb over a gate I came across on my walk. Let alone get on a horse and stay on for miles over rough ground. Such is life when cancer strikes!",

      "Content": "Hi Mark. Interesting you should mention the vivid dreams after chemo. I wish I had noted it down when mine started. I'm still getting them now night after night. I know they started during chemo which finished the end of April this year. But I started the herceptin half way through and am now coming up to my 12th injection. But I still get the vivid dreams that seem to take me into a larger than life world where I usually am glad to wake up from and discover they are not real. I wonder if the stress of everything brings them on as I have suffered from sleep paralysis in the past. As for the side effects from the herceptin. It's difficult to tell as I am also on the dreaded letrozole daily tablet. I do get sore feeling feet and sore numb finger tips. But that could be due to the letrozole. I feel like the princess with the pea syndrome. Except I feel every stone and bump when I walk however thick my soles on my boots are. Some days I'm tired and just take it easy. But again that could be left over from all the chemo and radiotherapy. I have just googled vivid surreal dreams and cancer. It seems a few others have it too. But I haven't done any research to see what it might be linked to. I hopefully finish the herceptin in March. I will be able then to see if the dreams end there.",

      "Content": "I have been taking letrozole since May 2016. I had a bone density scan and was told I had osteopenia. So I was prescribed calcium and D3 . My hair before chemo was long, fine and straight. It came back thicker and curly. I was worried about the hair loss with letrozole so I started taking Tesco's hair skin & nail suppement. It has got the same ingredients as the posh expensive stuff. But it is only £3 a box of thirty. Up until the end of 2020 there is an offer of three for the price of two on it. Which makes it only £2 a box. Worth it I think. My hair at the moment is still thick, though not so curly. I will certainly carry on taking the supplement as after fifteen months on letrozole, there is no noticeable signs of hair loss.",

      "Content": "Hi Maria. I started to keep a diary after my second lot of chemo.To begin with it was just a log of my side effects which I found useful later. I could check up after further treatment if side effects were the same. I would get something I thought was new, but after checking what had happened before, would find it wasn't new. Then when emotions set in I started to add feelings I was unable to tell people I had. Hopefully if something happens to me I will have time to burn the diary as I would never want people to read some of the things I have said. Which I meant deeply at the time. But felt different about at other times. Although I can only read back at the physical symptoms, not the personal feelings, it has helped me to be able to talk out my innermost real feelings. Even though be it only to myself. This years diary is full of all the pain I have gone through. Next years diary is going to be full of all the joy I bring into my life. It's going to be the new stronger me that doesn't have to write about all the things that have made me cry. I am glad this subject has been brought up as it might help others be encouraged to start their own journey in a diary. I wish I had started a diary from the very beginning. But what has been written, has in many ways been a big comfort to me.",

      "Content": "Hi nicnic. I have always wanted smaller boobs. I used to ride welsh ponies in ridden classes at shows all over the country for the boss I worked for. I always wanted small boobs, and long thin legs to look good riding in the show ring. As I had large boobs and short legs I was top heavy. And when I reached pension age, my boobs had reached my waist almost. When I got breast cancer my surgeon gave me the choice, mastectomy on the cancer boob, and a rebuild, or cancer removed and large reduction to both. He said in my case because I had always wanted smaller boobs, and because of their drooping large size, the reduction was best for me. I asked him to take off both. But he wouldn't. I said take loads off, he said he would. I said what if you don't get all the cancer, he answered he would go in again. Well nicnic, all I can say is I have now got the boobs I always wanted. I don't even ever have to wear a bra. They are like teenage boobs. I have got a long way to go as I'm ER and HER2 positve. So I have the horrid letrozole, and the three weekly herceptin. But I have perfect boobs. Which is a nose snub to cancer. It hasn't been able to completely ruin my life. Pity about the long thin legs I've always wanted. But then I suppose you can't have anything.

      "Content": "Hi Debs. You have had lots of advice. All I can add is that I too live alone with my five cats. I got all sorts of warnings about not letting the cats sleep with me, lick me etc. I was even told to foster the cats out or re home them as they would be too much for me. I of course took no notice. It was my cats that would get me through this cancer thing. My reaction to people was it was not the animals that would infect me, but humans with their filthy germs. My only concern was them jumping on my chest after surgery. But they seemed to know mum was in pain and steered clear of my chest area. I had FEC - T and herceptin and finished radiotherapy on the 15th June. Yes it was difficult at times. But I find being responsible for animals seems to always give you the strength to care for them however bad you feel. ",
