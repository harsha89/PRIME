      "Content": "Yes I did. I used to have chemo on a Friday by the following Tuesday I was back to work.  I worked because I wanted to and not because I had to. I am entitled to 6 months full pay sick leave so thought all the while I felt well enough then no reason not too work. It would depends on how you are effected by the side effects and what job you do. I work in an office so not really exposed to germs etc.",

      "Content": "Hi there I had all my treatment privately apart from radiotherapy, as I have private medical through work, they capped the amount spent on cancer treatment, so I did not have enough in the pot for radiotherapy, however have been seeing my onco privately. If I had gone private with radiontherapy then I still would have to go to my local NHS hospital althought have a \"VIP\" service but with radiotherapy you are in and out very quickly- well I was anyway so the VIP bit would have been wasted!!! With moving from private to NHS for radiotherapy, I had to obtain a referal from my GP which took longer than expected, so from having surgery to starting radiotherapy was 9 weeks. I have two sessions left of radiotherapy- total of 24!!!",

Have a look on the NHS choices website. ",

      "Content": "I experienced the same and after doing some research I found that the hair is dead which is causing the pain and the only way to have comfort is for the hair to come out. I had long hair, first had it cut to a bob, then as my hair started to fall out I had it shaved to a grade 5. Don't shave to bald as this will be even more uncomfortable. I found the penetration of the shower would pull the hair out and ease the pain and i used to pull it out too!!! I had EC chemo and unfortunately the cold cap didn't work for me and I have some lovely wigs and hats. ",

At St Lukes Cancer Unit in Guildford there is a charitable run organisation called the Fountain Centre whereby they offer acupuncture so I jumped at the chance to do anything to help with these hot sweats!! The only thing to remember is if you have had any lymph nodes removed then they won't be able to touch that arm. They say you should see an improvement after around 6 treatments. Good luck Claire xx",

I had to pull over on a main road and wait for help as i could not go any further. Thereafter i always had a lift as the side effects will kick in as your treatment moves forward. To be honest if you can get someone to take you then it is alot safer and i dont think you will feel up to taking the train and tube, when you are not feeling 100%. Claire",

I would take tablets for both about 3 days before chemo and about a week after which helped loads! Once the sickness had gone i felt pretty normal.  My hair did fall out after my second chemo. I did try the cold cap but it did not help but my hair was the least of my worries compared to what you are going through. My treatment finished in September and i have a lovely pixie cut!  Claire x x",
