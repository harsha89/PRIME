    "Content": "Hi Jackie I had daily nose bleeds while I was on chemo.  They didn't last long; like yours, about 3 mins or so.  I spoke to my oncologist who said that the chemo I was on (Paclitaxol + Carboplatin x 12), could cause nose bleeds as the lining in your nose can thin out a bit.  Needless to say, I had tissues everywhere - just in case, and a towel on my pillow at night.  About a week after I finished the chemo, my nose bleeds stopped, though, it took me a while to get used to not having the daily bleed.  One thing I found that did help was to moisturise your nostrils with a bit of Vaseline or lip balm.  It feels a bit weird, but it helped.   Have a word with your oncologist; hopefully they'll be able to set your mind at ease.
