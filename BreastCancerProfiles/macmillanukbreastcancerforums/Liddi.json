      "Content": "Hello I had biofocial breast cancer with three tumours 2 were grade 2 and one a 3 they were invasive. I had skin sparring mastectomy after the surgery the cavities were there and the orange peel look. I raised concerns from the start but was told to moisturise which I have done. The radiotherapy has made this worse and now my skin in swollen. I went to see my BCN on Monday and she took pictures to show my surgeon. She said she will look at it in about two weeks when my treatment has stopped which is this Friday. I wanted an immediate reconstruction and was told there would be changes however the only change is the sore dry skin and a little firmer. I want the inplant removed and have a tram flap or simular as I hate the feel of the inplant. I want to be soft again!",

      "Content": "Hello I am hoping someone will be able to help me. I had my surgery in Nov 14 had a few issues with infection and I had two deep creases within my skin. I spoke to my BC nurse who spoke to my surgeon who said moisturise. Ive always done this anyway, but increased. Still no change! I am now having radiotherapy and apart from being very sore still no change. Ive been talking to an american lady who calls themÂ breast concavities! No professional has told me what they are or what can be done. They are very ugly and deep, and they are where the tumors were removed. The skin looks like orange peel and the pores very large. My skin was never like this before. If you can advise me please do. I know things will change after treatment has finished but these things skin creases or concavities are not going away. Has anyone got or had them and how was it cured? Thank you",
