      "Content": "Hi all im recently diagnosed 3 weeks ago and i was due to have my oncology appointment today to discuss my treatment. Ive had a biopsy on my lump which showed cancer stage 2 then a node showed on mammogram but was just reacting so far thats all ive had. I came home from the school run to find a letter saying they have changed it to next week! I worked myself up for this appointmemr as i e been going out of my mind with fear and anxiety. i called the breast department and the receptionist found out that as i recently had a chest xray and CT scan they hadnt recieved the results yet. When i had the scans done the nurses said they are on the computer straight away for the docs to see. As you can imagine my mind is now going into overdrive thinking omg what if the tests have picked something up thats worse and they need to rethink treatment. Would they make me wait another week of things were bad? At my last appointment the doc knew i still had tests to be done but i wouldnt need to wait for them. im just in such a state now...i rung the bcn amd had to leave a message so im waiting for her to call back. Has anyone else experienced this? Please help any advice how to cope with this. Thanks",

      "Content": "Yes it would ive only had ultrasound on armpit, mamogram and 2 bipsies so gues thats not much to go on.... My bcn rung me back thank goodness and said they was waiting for the CT scan results but they wernt through. By next week it will be so all the info is all together then they can give me the info in one go. Gonna be a tough weeks wait again now. She did give me some positives as no cancer detected in one gland that showed on mammogram also my blood results were good.",
