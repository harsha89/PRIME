Had my mri this morning and have just had a call from my bcn telling me not to go next week as woman who does marker has looked at my mri and said she would struggle to find where to put it,cant tell me much more all to be discussed on Tuesday and they will ring me. Iasked if I was still having my chemo and yes that's all on track. Is my marker not being done because my cancer is to large they wouldn.t say...I am back where I was at diagnosis thinking all the bad things have any of you had this happens I am in a bad place again right now. grannie xxxxxxxx",

      "Content": "Hi Lynn,Carolyn,Steve and Helen Many thanks for your replies I am a little more calmer at the moment,have thrown myself into some good old fashioned housework in readiness for my chemo. Its just so worrying and as hard as you try to drive those bad thoughts out they seem to sneak up on you. My ct scan a couple of weeks ago showed I didn.t have it anywhere else,but mri is more in depth I know but best to find that now so treatment plan can be tweaked if necessary its just when bcn said they would struggle to find space for marker I panicked, As soon as your messages started coming in I didn.t feel alone again so if the sqatters in my right breast have invited others to stay or I have an obese squatter or they are taking up residence outside of my breast then they had better watch out because they have really peed me off now and the eviction notice is on its way. thanks all of you, denisexxxxxxxxxx",

Hope this helps Dee xx",
