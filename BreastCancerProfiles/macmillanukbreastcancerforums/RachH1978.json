    "Content": "Hi I discovered a lump in my left breast whilst showering on Friday evening. I have been to the GP today and after examining me he has referred me fast track to the breast clinic. To say I'm terrified is an absolute understatement! I am 40 & quite overweight & after reading various threads on google I'm now convinced it will be bad news. Don't know how I'm going to bear the wait & carry on like normal around my 3 children. Any advice would be much appreciatedÂ ",
