    "Content": "Hi Maria   I have been on Tamoxifen for nearly 12 months and suffer from hot flushes and night sweats, I have just started taking evening primose supplements as advised by my oncologist and it seems to take the edge of symptoms. I also suffer from joint pains especially my right hip again on the advice of my onc. I have started taking pain relief tablet and they have worked.  JayD",
