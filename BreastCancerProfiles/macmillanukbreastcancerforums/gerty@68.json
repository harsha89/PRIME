      "Content": "Hi, I had my NM appoin 1 week ago today. Nothing to worry about! Just like any other injection, little bit of a sting & that's it. I had my mastectomy & immediate diep reconstruction last Tues & came home on Fri evening. I was so worried about everything but thankfully I've found it not as bad as I'd built it up in my head. Try & stay as positive as you can, I believe it's helped me. Please let us know how you get on. i hope it all goes well. Big hugs xx",

      "Content": "Hi Rachel, Sorry to hear you're having to have mx surgery. I'm 2 weeks post op mx & immediate recon using DIEP flap. I know it's not exactly the same as what you're having but thought I'd share my experience to hopefully give you some sense of ease.  I was due to stay in for 5 days but was discharged after 3. My 2 breast drains were removed on day 2 & my abdo drains on the day I went home. It didn't hurt to have them removed. I have waterproof dressings on all of my wounds, tho I didn't manage to shower until the day I was going home. I was getting a wash in a disposable bowl for the first couple of days. Now I'm home I've been able to shower every day. My hubby helped for the first couple of days as certain movements & stretches were a bit difficult. Your drain dollies sound like a good idea as the hospital put mine in plastic carrier bags. I was advised to buy a couple of front fastening sports bras & it was good advice. I found it so much easier when my breast was getting checked so often by the nurses & doctors. Things I found useful during my stay that you haven't already mentioned were: None perfumed facial wipes (once I'd had a morning wash that was it!) Tissues Knickers A hand held or battery operated fan (my room was like an oven) Carton soft drinks as I was really thirsty all the time The hospital also gave me a \"sippy\" cup when I was coming round from the anaesthetic as I couldn't sit up properly to drink from a proper glass. It may be an idea to take one in case they don't offer you one. I really hope it all goes well & wish you a speedy recovery. Take care Lorna xx",

      "Content": "Hi, I had left mxt in Feb this year with imm recon. My plastic surgeon told me to buy front fastening sports bra/s 1 cup size larger & 2 back size larger (I'm normally 38D so bought 42E). She was spot on. I bought a couple & wore them continually for 6 weeks. I still occasionally wear one to bed if my boob feels a bit tender or achey. In the day I wear none wired bras in my old size. I find wired bras too uncomfortable now. New boob is a little bit big for it but not over noticeably. I didn't want to buy any more until everything has settled & fine tuning has been done.  I hope everything goes ok & wish you a speedy recovery  Lorna xxxx",

      "Content": "Hi Welshie007, I'm 2 weeks post op single left mxt with immediate DIEP reconstruction & feel much better than I thought I would. I had previously had my appendix removed, x2 laparoscopy & an ectopic pregnancy. My BMI was 31.7. When I knew I had to have a mxt the DIEP recon was my preferred choice. I live in Liverpool & was told by my surgeon in the Royal Liverpool Hospital they couldn't offer me this choice there. They said there was a surgeon in Whiston hospital who specialised in this area especially with ladies with higher BMI's. I'm not sure where you are based but the surgeon's name is Ms Rieka Taghizadeh. My treatment was done on the NHS & the care I received has been amazing. She really took pride in her work. I was told to expect to stay in hospital for 5 nights, but they were so pleased with my progress I went home after 3 (drain free!). I had to return 4 days later as I thought my newly positioned tummy button had an infection. MS Tagz was out of the country speaking at a conference but had left word with the other surgeon that if I contacted the hospital for any reason she wanted to know about it. Her colleague informed her I was going in & then also contacted her to let her know how my appointment went. I needed a CT scan before my op to make sure the blood vessels in my abdomen were ok after having previous surgeries there. My op was supposed to last approx 9 hrs but ended up being 12 as the blood vessels were' as good as they had hoped. I hope this info helps you in your choice of treatment. Wishing you well & a speedy recovery. Big hugs Lorna xxxx",

I'm interested to hear from folks who have had immediate reconstruction using an implant or DIEP as these are the options I'm considering. How you felt asetheticly after surgery? Recovery time? How long you needed off work? Thanks again for being there for me. Big hugs Lorna x",

I had a VAB biopsy on Friday so will hopefully know next week. I was worried about the recovery part but from what other members are saying it doesn't seem TOO bad.  Best wishes to you for the remainder of your recovery. Lorna xxx",
