      "Content": "Hi everyone I was diagnosed 4 weeks ago with Lobular Breast Cancer, Ive had an MRI scan and am now waiting for a CT scan, which is on Sunday and then finally my results and hopefully a treament plan next Thursday. As my cancer is slow growing my BCN and consultant have assured me that the wait wont make any difference but as time goes on I wonder if every ache and pain is the cancer spreading ... strange but before being told about the CT scan had no aches and pains !! Staying positive and taking a day at a time ... but god it tiring keeping busy all the time !! Would love to hear from anyone else in the same position, maybe keep each other entertained while we wait :-)",
