      "Content": "Hi Uzumex Firstly welcome to What Now, I'm sure you will find everyone here friendly and helpful. I am nearing the end of my Herceptin treatment, have 2 more cycles to go (had 18 in total). I'm pleased to say I personally have experienced no unpleasant side-effects. I'm sure you have been made aware of the risk of heart damage, but you are scanned prior to and constantly during treatment to make sure that all is well, and so far (touch wood!) I have had no problems with that either. I've even started running again! With regards to Lapatinib, I have heard of this drug but don't know a lot about it. Do you know if you will be given Herceptin also as part of the trial, or is it a case of \"either/or\"?? It's a tough decision you are faced with, and all I can suggest is that you try to gather as much information about both drugs as you can. Clinical trials are usually a good option, as you are very closely monitored, however I would definitely compare available statistics on both before I committed. There is a section on Cancerbackup on BC trials, and also on Cancer Research UK's site. Very best of luck with whatever you decide!",

      "Content": "Hi Anneliese Sorry to hear you are feeling a bit down today. We all have our off days, and after what you've been through you've every right to feel fed-up every now and then. And you're right, it will all come with time, you just need to learn to be a bit patient with yourself (and your body!) A couple of tips; if you feel up to it, try and get out for a little walk. Exercise is one of the best ways of improving your mood, even if it's only for a few minutes. I would also have suggested Starflower oil supplements, but as your cancer was hormone positive I would double-check with your Onc. before taking these. A cancer diagnosis impacts every aspect of our lives, not just physically, and what you are experiencing is not petty, but absolutely normal. Hopefully this feeling will pass as quickly as it arrived!",

      "Content": "Hi Caroline I had 4 cycles of Taxotere following 4 cycles of AC last year. I personally found the Taxotere much easier than the AC (I had bad sickness with this), and actually had more energy, none of the associated joint/muscle pains, and no sickness at all! The only thing I did have was a severe allergic reaction to the first infusion - almost a blue light job! - but fortunately with the correct level of pre-med and steroids my Onc. was able to stabilise this so I could continue the course. With regard to your nails, a top tip I received was to keep them painted a really dark colour for the duration of your treatment. The reason they can fall out is due to a reaction with sunlight, so by blocking the light you can save them. I'm pleased to say that I did this and had no problems whatsoever!! Oh, another thing, you will probably find your hair starts to grow back - this is quite common when Taxotere follows AC/FEC. It's peculiar because Taxotere on it's own causes hair loss, just one of those strange but welcome side-effects!! Best of luck for tomorrow, I really hope you find it as easy as I did.",
