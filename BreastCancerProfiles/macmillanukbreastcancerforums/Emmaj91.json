      "Content": "Hi all I'm here just looking for some advice. I went to my gp on Monday as I've been having an contionous pain in my left breast and under my arm and blood stained discharge from my nipple. The gp examined my breast and said he could also feel a lump to so referred me for an urgent appointment at the breast clinic. The wait is horrific even though its only been a few days. What is the experience at the clinic like? I've read the wait for younger patients (i am 28) is longer is this true do you know?  Thank you",

      "Content": "Thank you for replying its nice to have people who understand as my mum and sister arr continuoulsy saying dont worry, your to young for it to be cancer. Which I hope is the case but it doesn't seem to be helping. Thanks for the explanation of the clinic I got my appointment through this morning for next Thursday so hopefully the week wait won't drag too much. My Gp found my lump but I can't seem to feel this that normal?  So sorry to hear of your diagnosis and hope your doing as well as you can be.  Xxx",
