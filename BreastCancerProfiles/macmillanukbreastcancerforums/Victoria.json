      "Content": "Hi Lynne, I have my second dose of FEC tomorrow and I too used the cold cap. I thought it was working until the start of this week when I got a burning sensation all over my head and it started coming out in clumps yesterday. I spoke to my BC nurse and she said it may not all fall out and that I should maybe try the cold cap again tomorrow. I dont know if I dare shave it off but its horrible how  it keeps falling out. I hope you feel better now you have shaved your head and hope your feeling ok after your second session. Good luck with the wig shopping :o) x x",
