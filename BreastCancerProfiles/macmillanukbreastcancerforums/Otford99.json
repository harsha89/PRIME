    "Content": "Hi Jen  I have had two sessions of FEC my third session is next Thursday.  I found my first chemo much easier to cope with as I had my hair, it didn't start falling out until Day 12 so I would say keep you hair for as long as you can and have it cut once it start to thin and fall out.  Once it started falling out in handfuls then I had my hairdresser come to my house and she cut it into a short pixie cut.  By the time I had had the second chemo session I had very fine strands and with the help of my son (aged 10) we decided to clipper it (number 3) it then felt so much better. I think it is better to do it in stages.  Your head feels very cold, I now know how babies feel but it is so much quicker in the mornings to get ready!  There is always an upside.  However, although I jest don't underestimate how you will feel without hair, it takes a few days to come to grips with and as you say it is quite scary, initially.   Good luck.    ",
