      "Content": "Hi Shimmer star , Hope your bad day has passed you by now.  You are towards the end of your treatment and then you can look at asking your surgeons opinion . I also had my mastectomy with reconstruction using an implant in Nov 17. I had a reduction on the other side at the same time . I was pleased with the result  , the nipple was moved upwards to bring it back into normality.  I would recommend this as my reconstruction is much smaller than my original boob. Good luck with your last chemo Your life will soon be all back up and running and you will look back and realise how strong you were. Hugs Jan x",
