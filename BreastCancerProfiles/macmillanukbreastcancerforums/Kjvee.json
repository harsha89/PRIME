      "Content": "Hi Rose! I was the proud owner of 46DDs! I also opted for a double MX for exactly the same reason! I remember my surgeon saying to me the day of the op, you do realise you will be an A cup after the surgery? I didn't care, I wanted the \"alien critter\" as I called it OUT. And if he took the other one too it couldn't come back there either! (plus it was a lot easier, only one operation, and I wasn't sure if I could cope with one DD breast and one A breast, one with a nipple one without, it just made sense to me) I didn't look at my breasts for a while after surgery, and when I did, I sort of liked them, and now they're being \"filled\" I like them even more! It's lovely to be asked what size would you like to be? I just said, keep filling till I say stop! Lol All I can say is embrace your body. I sold all my bras on eBay before treatment so I have money to spend on pretty bras when I decide what size I want to be! I hope my story helps hun, good luck! Karen xx",

      "Content": "Hi, I'm new to the group and I was wondering if you could help me. I was diagnosed with breast cancer last August, I'm now under the heading of \"survivor\" but I can't stop crying. I'm so unhappy, and I don't know why. I'm pushing my family away, the same family who stood by me. It's breaking my heart. I'm so confused. What's wrong with me?",

      "Content": "Thankyou Helen. I am seeing my Doctor next week, as I know feeling like this s not good for me or my family. I just feel so guilty. I survived CANCER. It was hard, no, it was the most difficult thing me and my family have had to go through. But I survived. I should be high fiving, jumping for joy, smiling from ear to ear. But I'm not. I'm crying at the drop of a hat, being horrid to my family and friends. But why? Have I gone mad? Is it the tablets? Am I depressed? Am I being selfish? Why am i here? I'm so confused",
