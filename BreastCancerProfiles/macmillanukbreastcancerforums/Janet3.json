      "Content": "That is a very strange comment about chemo not reaching the liver as it has recently reached mine. My breast cancer spread to liver and lungs. Now the lung tumours have stayed the same size for 3 and a half years! and to be honest they don't bother me. I have hadespecially good results on my liver with initially taxotere and cepcetabine and then taxol and avastin (I think these drugs have less side affects to those suggested for you). After 6 cycles of each ( Have had 3 full cyles in all) I have had a partially liver met reduction of almost half. I think that is very good and I then had six months off it using either capcetabine on its own or femara. Hope this helps.",

      "Content": "my own experience of taxol is very good. I have had at least 12 cylcles with a break. I worked throughout about 12 hours a week. It was the journey to and from the hospital, I am about an hour away, sorting out transport and the time there that was particularly tiring every week. In addition I used the cold cap, the elctric plug in sort and have kept my head hair, though no eye lashes. I too have had the \"bloody\" nose, though nothing else particularly to report.",

      "Content": "I have just read your post on the brain tumour site Jan, and find I am in a changed position now. I had a MRI on my brain again and it has shown multiple brain tumours (odd one or teo before). I am devasted like you.My onc said that the brain tumours were now more imp than liver. Surgery is not an option, my option has been radiotherapy, which I do not want as it is only 50 percent successful I am told and chemo which has also not good odds. I am though currently looking on the internet about Gamma Knife radiation. Dont know if you are suitable. I have not been HER2 for Heceptin to work, I have been on Taxotore and capcetabine or later Taxol and Avastin, I am now immune to the Taxatane group, so trying EC chemo. I was first diagnosed with secondaries Oct 2000, so I guess I have done well.",

      "Content": "Hi, This is my first post, so hope I am doing it right. It is reassuring to hear of others who are breast cancer met survivors. I try to remain positive. I have had secondaries in the liver, lung, brain and spine for 3 1/4 years. I have tended to be on one of the taxane group with first capcetabine then avastin for 6 months on then 6 months off. However I have only gone 3 months this time off chemo before it has become more active in my liver. I may becoming immune to the taxane group now. I have tolerated them very well and have kept my hair thanks to the cold cap. My question is what are the next possible treatment options? Thanks. First time I have spoken to other people with mets, sometimes I feel very alone.",

It is my liver mets that are my concern, I have numerous and my largest is 9cm, so it needs to be shrinking quick. I can feel an uncomfortable bulk now under my rib cage. Is there anything new and radical treatments out there or other chemos that might work? I am on nothing at the moment, until my onc. comes up with something. I too though would like to check it out.",

      "Content": "Hi Annca, Yes it is worrying, to answer your questions. There was no explanation by my consultant what happened, so I have another one now! I think the treatment after mastectomy now is tamoxifen for 2 years and then changing to Femara which has found to be more effective. I would look into Femara if I was you. The bone secondaries where eventually diagnosed after I had been treat for back pain for about 6 months (it wasn't supposed to come back remember, a good prognosis) it was like dull ache and that time I also said I felt uncomfortable in my right side under my ribs (felt a bit bulky) so after my GP hand examined me she said my liver was enlarged, I knew it was bad news, so I had scans and everthing else was then picked up. The same year I had my 5 year check with my first consultant, he felt my spine and my left side and didn't find anything, but 5 days later I returned to my GP and it was her who told me initially about the liver. Sorry just read my post again and it sounds a bit jumbled but I hope you get the main points. Janet",

      "Content": "I strongly regret not being offered chemo or radiotherapy. Had breast cancer 2000, mastectomy, no lymph glands involved and my Doc said don't need chemo as 96% sure not come back, had tamoxifen for 5 years. 2005 I find that cancer spread to liver, lungs, bones. I still blame my doctor to this day that he did not offer me chemo, as I trusted him. I feel if i had had it, it would have mopped up any cancer cells still there. In fact I am quite jittery typing this as I am so angry. I no longer trust Doctors and do my own research. (He also later let me down not spotting the secondaries). Chemo is a piece of cake to what I am faced with now.",

      "Content": "I think Lyndy you have made an excellent point, about trusting Doctors. It is strange I am an confident, capable 40 year old woman, but STILL I trusted in what the Consultant said. He had an air of confidence himself which obviously reflected back to me. I am annoyed with myself for also trusting my GP who treat my back pain with ainti inflammatries for 6 months. She explained it was two small bones in the base of my spine rubbing together!(the 6 month later, I experienced the pain in my right side which turned out to be my liver mets)She sent me for an xray, which showed nothing as they were looking at the base of my spine but the mets were in the middle of the spine where the xray did not reach! Why did I not insist on a proper scan? Whether deep down we are still too trusting of authority figures and want to believe what they say. My health care was a total shambles. That is why I really despair of people going through an illness just relying on the total trust of Doctors. The downside is that it is quite exhausting researching and checking things yourself. Sometimes I would just like to be able to \"flop\" and relax in that total trust, but never again.",
