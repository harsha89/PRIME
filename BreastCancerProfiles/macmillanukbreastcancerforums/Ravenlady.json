      "Content": "Hi Susie, I finished chemo on New Years Eve. I got my hair dyed with an organic dye at the hairdressers in June. She said to avoid bleach until it's longer as it's so damaging for the hair. I had long straight highlighted blonde hair previously. It grew back white at the sides and dark grey down the middle so I looked like a badger! It;s also curly now. My hairdresser advised against dark blondes because the white roots would show too much so now I'm a light platinum blonde and everybody says it looks great. If you wanted to try home hair colour look for Daniel Field products online. The colours get very good reviews and they're free from the chemical that can damage your hair. Hope this helps. Annette",

      "Content": "Hello, I'm due to have a right mastectomy with axial lymph node clearance on 11th August, followed by chemo and possibly radiotherapy. The thought of only having one breast for ages depresses me and I would like to have immediate reconstruction. My surgeon hasn't refused to do this but he has advised that if I do need radiotherapy later then this can have an adverse effect on the appearance and texture of the reconstructed breast. Has anybody had immediate reconstruction and then radiotherapy who can tell me of their experiences please? ",

      "Content": "Hi, thanks for telling me of your experience. After weighing up the pros and cons I think I'm going to hold off on the reconstruction. While I dread the thought if only having one breast, my new breast will have to last a long time so I think it's better if I don't risk spoiling the look of it and maybe having to haveit reconstructed again after radiotherapy. ",
