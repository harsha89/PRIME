      "Content": "Wishing you all the best for Thursday, I hope all goes well for you. I'm waiting anxiously to get pathology results which will determine if I'll need to have a mastectomy or not. I had a lumpectomy at the beginning of August but 1 of the 4 samples taken came back positive so I've had a second operation to remove more tissue. It's inspirational to read your post and I admire how calm your feeling about your operation. Take Care Janice x",

      "Content": "Hi Everyone, I was diagnosed with breast cancer at the end of January 2015. I have lobular cancer in my left breast with a mass that measured 5cm. Initially I was told I would need to have a mastectomy because of the size of the tumour. When I seen the Oncologist in February I was given the option to have chemotherapy first to try and shrink the mass so that I might have a chance of saving my breast but there were no guarantee's as I was also told that lobular cancer is unpredictable. I've had 4 chemo sessions so far and today after seeing the Oncologist he says the chemo is working and my tumour has shrunk by half and I've still 2 more treatments to go, so pretty positive news All being well the tumour will be even smaller by the time I go for surgery early August then it'll be followed by radiotherapy. I am so relieved and wanted to share my good news with everyone and tell anyone out there in the same boat not to give up hope and stay positive.",

      "Content": "Hi Elaine, Thanks for your reply, it always helps to talk to people who've been through the same thing. I had my 1st mammogram check in April and everything was fine and I've got an appointment to see my Oncologist next Monday so will ask her to check it out. As you can imagine my minds working overtime because I don't know what's causing the discomfort all of a sudden, I've had it for a few days now. You're right the scar site does feel lumpy so hopefully I'm worrying about nothing. I'll keep you posted. Janice xx",
