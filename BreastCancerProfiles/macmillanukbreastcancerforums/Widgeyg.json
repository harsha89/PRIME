    "Content": "Hi,  I am 66 years old, and I had a Diep flap and a double mastectomy on 26th February this year.  It\u2019s one of the most painful experiences I have ever had, and I wish that I hadn\u2019t had it done.  Weeks on, I\u2019m still in pain with my tummy, it feels like I am pregnant and when I move, my tummy goes into spasms and causes a terrible tightening feeling.  In Hospital I was heavily medicated, but felt I was off the planet.  I take paracetamol regularly, but nothing else.  Cosmetically the doctors say that I\u2019m healing great, but the scar is from my left hip to my right.  My breast reconstruction is not a pretty sight, but I am grateful that I\u2019m cancer clear.  My left breast is constantly filling up with fluid, and blood, two weeks ago I had 360mls drained from the breast, the relief was wonderful but short lived. It has started to refill once more.  I\u2019m due to see my Plastic Surgeon in 3 weeks time, if my breast fills much bigger I will have to try and get it drained sooner.  Has anyone had any of these things happen to them.  I would appreciate any replies. ",
