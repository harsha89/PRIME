      "Content": "hello Chrissie,  I celebrate your 5 years survivorship.  I am 37 years old. I was diagnosed at the beggining of this year and currently I am undergoin chemotherapy. I will have my 3rd round tomorrow. 1 more of the red one and then 12 more each week of apparently of earsier ones. I feel so lonely many times, I dont know young people that have gone through it...I am in Colombia and in the support groups the majority are elderly...that is fine...the thing is that the process is different. So, I dont tjink they understand my process.  My husdand left me as soon as he knew I needed chemo and he told me two days ago he is already in a relationship...he ment someone he has strong feelings for.  so, I really strugguling right now. This has been a difficult year, but I am doing everything I can to get over this.  Would we lovely if we can mail each other... take care and thank you for been there for so many peple...it is lovely, hugs,  Xxx",

      "Content": "Ogre, Kipper and London Butterfly I cant even believe that there are strories so simmilar to mine...they really got to my heart. I just can say that you are very strong and amazing women. I am 38 years old and for a few years have problems with my husband. Things got really bad last June and I decided to leave -for a few  months- an try to finish my PhD in my own country after been in the UK for 10 years. He came to visit for 3 months, during that time a doctor discovered the lump in my breast - thing that he didnt even cared that much, he left and a couple of weeks later I got told that I have BC stage 2A. Then, I decided to have my treatment in my own country and couldnt went back to the UK. At first he was sort of supportive but he just became more distant with time. Before my surgery he didnt even reply my phone calls...and when he did it was just really weird. I new it was the end. One day over the phone he told me that it was better to finish our marriage and 3 months later I decided to write a letter to him saying good-bye to wich he respond saying he meet somebody else months before... he met her after my diagnosis. It was heart brooken and I have to admit it havent been easy...but I hope time will help me heel. I did love him with all my heart. Since I havent been in my country for so long I havent got many friends here and it is just akward to say to people that I havent seen for many years I got BC...they just run away scared. I live with my mum who is 83 with many healt problems but thanks God I have her. I have been to all my appoiments and chemo treatments alone...at the begining it was weird but I actually now like to do things that way...I feel somehow more in control. I miss ex, but at the same time I know that this person didnt made me happy for quite a long time, our plans in life were different  _ I wanted to have children for many years and he didnt- and that he find a \"girldfriend\" during my treatment was just really a nasty thing to do. He send me e-mails asking me for forgiveness but I decided not to reply since I dont feel he is sincere and he ask for it just to feel better himself...he dont really mean it. He is happy with his new girdfriend and I just want to get out the way. I actually amazed of how strong we can be when we need to... there is not other choice but carry on. I close to finsh chemo soon in 3 weeks and I just hope things get better...I think, I have been to the ultimate low in my life that things just have to get better after this...or at least I hope so. I close to finish treatment but I am not sure what is going to hapen in my life...BC changed everything...I know I have to go back to the UK to finish my PhD and to pick up all my things that I left in my in-laws. I somehow need to restart my life. Ladies, I wish you all the happiness in the world and I have to say I admire you for been so strong. All I can say is that now I have a deep sense of connection to people who share simmilar stories to mine becouse they are the only people who understand what  we have been through. X, sandy",
