      "Content": "Hi, i am 46 and getting treatment for BC at the moment, i am getting a MX on Thursday, after previous surgery was unsuccessful! My mum died 18 months ago of Ovarian Cancer, which she fought for 7 years, she was 68! but to get back to your mums situation!! A close friend has gone through similar with her mum!, although she was first diagnosed at 70! Her breast was ulcerated and very advanced, further tests showed it had spread to her bones! They said there was very little that they could do, she had less than a week of Rads, as she said she wanted quality and couldnt be bothered with it! but she did start taking Tamoxifin! They later found that it had spread to her Brain - but she had a good 3 years from diagnosis (breast ulcaration), and those 3 years were good ones! I know your mum is older and everyone is different, but when my friends mum was first diagnosed, we all expected it to be very quick, but she enjoyed a further 3 realitivly good years. I know it is very hard, but all you can do, is be there for your mum, even if your choices for her would be different!! My mum came to terms with what was in front of her, and seemed to gain an inner peace, she knew she had only a few weeks left and said and planned everything that was important to her! It was heartbreaking at the time, but when i look back, i think, she brought me into the world, and i saw her out, and it was a privalge. xxx",

      "Content": "Hi , I had WLE & ANC on 17th January, but results showed it was bigger than thought (5cm) and 4 lymph nodes involved, so i had to have an MX a week ago! I am 46 and like you have looked into reconstruction! I think it is a very personal thing and everyone is different! I have decided that i am not going to have any reconstruction, i have read about it and weighed everything up! i just feel that if i can get through the next 18months of treatment, i dont want to put myself or my body through anything more! But everyone is different and i am stage 3 and HER2+, so i think it depends on the treatment ahead! I think it is a very individual choice and i wish you good luck with whatever you decide.

      "Content": "Hi dorothee and lindy, thanks for your replies. I have got my head around it a bit more now, and happy to take everything they throw at me!! Just the initial change threw me a bit, as I had started to make some plans around rads ect, but nothing that can't be put on hold!! Sorry your FEC didn't go as planned Dorothee, this certainly teaches us to go with the flow, and not plan too far ahead!! Lindy - glad to here you are coping well with TC too!! I had read so many negatives about TAX, but am also coping well!! I have experienced mild constipation, followed by mild diarrhoea - lol, one extreme to the next, mild aches and pains and a lot more tired after the 3rd ( only managed 6 days of work), but by far the worst is my mouth!! My ONC has prescribed tablets that are normally given to leukaemia patients, she thinks the steroids are causing it more than the chemo!! Just hope they work!! Do either of you know much about Neuts? I didn't know much about this, but a friend has sort of explained it!! Mine has increased with each chemo, is this normal? My last was 6.1!! Lindy can I ask why got TC rather than FEC-T? My Muga scan was borderline! I am due to start Herceptin with 5th or 6th! Take Care Ladies xxx",

      "Content": "Hi All I haven't posted for a while, but read posts and replies regularly!! I was due to have my last of 4 TC on Thursday, but after an appointment with my ONC today, I am now to have 6!! I really wasn't expecting that as 6 was never mentioned and I had a referral appoint for radiotherapy on Friday! Has this happened to anyone else? She said that as I have tolerated it so well, and taking into account, that I am HER2+, stage 3 and my original tumour was 5cm, with another one found in MX histology, she felt 6 would be better! I do think I have been lucky so far as the side effects have been minimal and I have managed to work part-time for 50% of the time! The worst so far has been my mouth and taste, it has been a nightmare - horrible creamy coating in my mouth, everything tastes disgusting and no texture, everything seems to disintegrate into mush!! My ONC has prescribed FLUCONAZOLE, has anyone had these tablets and do they work? I was also more tired after my 3rd chemo, will this get progressively worse? I was so prepared for Thursday to be my last, so felt I could cope, but the thought of another 3 is a bit daunting!! Although I am glad that they are giving me the max available!! Any advice or info is greatly received, big hugs to everyone, whatever stage in this journey you are at!! I have remembered things from past posts, that weren't really relevant to me at that time, that have helped later in my journey - thank you xxx",

I am 46 and was diagnosed in December with HER2+ BC, I hade a WLE & ANC, 5 weeks ago, but my 2cm stage 2 is actually 5cm stage 3, and i am going in on Thursday for a MX! Like you i cant have reconstruction, as i will get Chemo, Rads, and Herceptin. At the moment i feel fine about the MX, but realise that might change when reality hits! I have looked at some pictures online, and am glad i did, as they have prepared me for whats to come! My first op, was not nearly as bad as i expected, and have been told that this one wont be either! Good luck with your op, and just hold onto the thought - that its getting rid of that evil C!",

      "Content": "Hi Cathy, My situation is similar, I live in Aberdeen and the screening age is 50. I found a lump in December, age 46 and was referred by my GP, original diagnosis was 2cm with lymph involvement, after an unsuccessful WLE and node clearance (4/14 affected), I had an MX. The histology showed the lump was 5cm, grade3, stage3 and another lump!! I am HER2 +, so dread to think what would have happened if I didn't find it?? I think the screening age should be reduced, but to what, I am not sure? I think some regions are screening at 47, which would have been too late for me, but every little helps! I am sure the 3 year difference would pick up thousands of women at an earlier stage, so well worth it. 40 would be the best age, although I know lots of younger woman are affected, but mammograms don't work well on younger, denser tissue.

      "Content": "Hi, I finished rads two weeks ago, after WLE, Node clearance 4/14 affected, MX, 6x TC Chemo, stage3, grade 3 IDC, and waiting to start Herceptin!! I thought rads were going to be easier, and the actual 15 sessions were, until day 19, when my skin broke down big time!! It's got progressively worse, It is now 16 days since my last session and not much better, still really burnt and sore, I have been to my GP twice and have steroid cream, antibiotics, diclofenic and antihistamine tablets! Has anyone experienced this, and if so, when should I see an improvement? This is really getting me down, I managed to work 50% of the time during chemo and during rads, but have been off for the last 2 weeks, and can't see me getting back to work any time soon? To top it all, I haven't been able to start Herceptin yet, as my MUGA scan results have been too low, so started Ramapril 2 months ago! I had another scan on Tuesday, so waiting to hear if herceptin will start on Friday!! Really scared that the delay's will affect things? Anyone been in the same situation? Xxx",
