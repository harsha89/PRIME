      "Content": "I don't have anything very helpful to add to this but also interested in knowing when you can stop wearing compression/sports bras post surgery.  I had mastectomy almost 2 weeks ago with a permanent expander.  Drains came out yesterday - cannot see any problems with that and don't have a dent.   I haven't been expanded yet so probably cannot compare.  Overall, I am doing good but still taking lots of painkillers as pain/ tightness is pretty tough.   Feeling very cheered by talk of holidays and swimwear -  back to our normal problem of what to wear on holidays, sounds like a nice problem now :-)",

      "Content": "Hi  Thought I would add to the Tamoxifen experiences.  I started tamoxifen last September and was first given Teva which I had read was a more favourable brand re side affects.   I then asked my Pharmacist to give me Teva each time which she has done with no issues.   Really,  I cannot complain too much as my side affects are not bad.  At first, I was very tired particularly in the mornings, had brain fog, a few hot flushes and dry mouth but most of that has eased off now.  I have joint pain which at times is quite bad particularly in hip and sometimes I take a painkiller for that.  I am planning to ask my GP if she can give me anything for joint pain as I like to do exercise and now I am finding that I am in a lot of pain afterwards.   The tiredness in the morning is a funny one, it is a sort of sluggish feeling that I never experienced before, I think initially I was also feeling a bit nauseous in the morning but I think that has passed too.  I think I was expecting things to be much worse, I had read about awful side affects so I think I can manage what is currently going on and hope that it continues like this.  M xx",

      "Content": "Hi Sacha,   tomorrow I am 3 weeks post right side mastectomy and reconstruction with permanent expander implant.  Its still early days for me but I will tell you what my experience has been so far.  I was very anxious about surgery but thankfully it all went well - my surgeon appears very happy with his handywork!  I spent 1 night in hospital and went home with 2 drains - I had the option of staying another night but all I wanted to do was go home to my own bed.  The pain was probably worse than expected - chest feels tight and sore so I took lots of painkillers.  It surprised me how much you use your chest muscles - moving in bed was agony.   A large V shaped pillow was/is wonderful for providing support in bed.   I did very little for first 2 weeks, rested and tried to sleep.  Drains came out after 5 days and the last one after 10 days.  I have just got the pathology results (stage 1, grade 2 multi focal) and  I don't need chemo or radium - big relief.    I had a sentinel node biopsy before the mastectomy which was clear.  Before surgery, my surgeon said I might need chemo or radium afterwards however he still went ahead with the permanent expander implant so I don't fully understand why they do that if there is a chance of radium interfering with the implant.  I have developed some swelling (seroma) which had to be drained yesterday - this is getting me down a bit, as its red and sore.   But I have to say, yesterday was the only day since surgery that I felt low (related to seroma draining and discomfort), I have mostly felt very relieved and looking forward to getting my life back.  For me the diagnosis stage  took 2 mths - a lot of tests which I found enormously stressful.   Once you know what you are dealing with, you can get your head around it and prepare.  I have been told 6 weeks to recover so 3 more to go!   Hope your surgery goes well. ",
