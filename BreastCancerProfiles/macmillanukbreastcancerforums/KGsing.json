      "Content": "Thank you all for taking the time to write to me. It\u2019s so encouraging to hear other people\u2019s stories and know that we aren\u2019t the only family going through this. Sometimes it does feel like that! Tallantire: my mum is receiving treatment in Surrey - about 2.5 hours from me. I have a young family and find it hard to get up to see her as often as I would like. And on days like today, when she is receiving treatment for the first time, I wish I was able to be there to support her.  She has a very supportive husband who is accompanying her to all her appointments. He too lost his 1st wife to cancer so feel like we are surrounded by it!  Thank you again and love to you all x x ",

      "Content": "Hi all, My mum was diagnosed with BC in September just before my 30th birthday. She has stage 2 with lymph nodes involved. She\u2019s had a mastectomy and nodes removed and is now on the next phase of treatment, starting chemo tomorrow. I don\u2019t live nearby and therefore feel so removed and unable to help her. I lost my dad 5 years ago to cancer also and am just so scared that I\u2019m going to loose my mum aswell. I always assume the worst outcome and read into everything but trying to remain positive for her.  Sending all you ladies lots of love x x",
