      "Content": "Hi Jean J, Thanks for the names of pharmacists. I have asked my GP to write Sandoz on prescription but they are not happy to do that, say they can only put description as Letrozole??? Thought I had managed to track Sandoz Brand down from Boots but they have now said that their supplier can no longer get that brand, even by trying to order it through their \"Special Request\" process. Will try Rowland and Newark and see if I have any better luck âœ¨",

      "Content": "Hi, I've been on Letrozole since June this year and also getting Herceptin by 3 weekly intravenous injection. Getting quite a lot of Side Effects. Been on Cipla Brand until a few days ago and now taking the Accord Brand. Would really like to have a go at taking the Sandoz Brand as it seems to be the one with the least side effects. Have tried to source this from my local pharmacies but not having much luck. Wondered if anyone knew of the name of any pharmacies that they had got the Sandoz Brand from ?",
