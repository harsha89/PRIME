      "Content": "Thanks, Twinwtower. Glad you were successfully treated for the rash & if my hand worsens during this cycle, I shall consult the Dr, although at the hospital, they are very much in their own mindset & don't take kindly to hearing about other peoples' experience - understandably I suppose! Pez, your tale of suffering is hard to read. Where on earth is the compassion? The side-effects are so nasty anyway, that to have this inexplicable rash which dominates every second of the day as well, must test your friend to the limit - the moreso since she doesn't have the reassurance that the drug is completely effective. With her immunity affected, it could take longer than a week to heal & life must be  a trial for her. (My last dose saw yet more different symptoms & I felt so faint & weak, with a racing heart that I spent 2 days staring into space, counting the hours till i could sleep & hopefully wake up a little better.Time hangs heavy when you're rough !)  I hope she gets through the days with as little pain as possible & that someone may find an appropriate medication for soothing her skin. How many more treatments is she likely to have, if things go ahead, is it one now?  I shall be thinking of her & hope to hear better news from you on here next time. Also, the topic of sending information by text message adds a very casual air to the procedure. I would expect a phone call, maybe supported by a quickie reminder closer to the date by text. I have been informed in person at clinic & have had blood results phoned to me, but have never been texted.  Strange how hospitals adopt very different procedures.  Regards, Heather",

      "Content": "I have found new symptoms with each of the 4 doses of Docetaxel and have found it a rough ride, as many have said. With the 3rd dose, I developed the bright red rash on the back of my injection hand, on Day 9. I got it checked out at the hospital & the Dr was baffled, claiming to have never seen anything like it. When I quoted the experiences on this discussion forum, he was simply dismissive! I had a dozen photos taken as a precaution, to monitor changes in size, severity etc. My own oncologist also claimed to be ignorant of such a rash. On my 4th dose of Docetaxel, I printed off these comments & took them in, but the nurses were again disinterested in these experiences. Being my last dose & (hopefully) my last visit to the chemo suite!!!, I went round & thanked all the nurses who'd treated me in chemo & in clinic & the last nurse I saw told me that there was a woman in another bay, receiving chemo, who has exactly the same rash!!  So, I was not so unique after all & she shares my oncologist! !Fortunately, your comments on here had reassured me, otherwise I may have feared all sorts of foolish problems!! The skin has now peeled to a pale brownish colour, but is very noticeable. I wonder if this final dose will produce another rash???",
