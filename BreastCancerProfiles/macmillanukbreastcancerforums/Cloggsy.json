    "Content": "Hi Anna I had EC then Docitaxel. I finished it in May. I agree with the other comments people have left. Keep on top of the side effects. I took lots of painkillers for the muscle aches and, cut my nails really short and used difflam mouthwash for my sore mouth. I also found using a hot water bottle on my back was really soothing. My taste was funny so I just ate what I felt like when I felt like it. I didn't have any nausea.Â I found that my spirits were really low when I was on Docitaxel. I wasn't depressed just low. I tried to go out with my husband and friends as often as possible. That helped me. One more thing, I had less side effects with each dose. I ached the most with the first. I hope it all goes OK for you Cx",
