    "Content": "Hi LondonLass I was also told my periods would stop before the 2nd injection but it ended up taking 4 before they did.  I then had a period after 7-8 months so now take tamoxifen as well (I was on letrozole).  My onc was surprised and I have been thoroughly checked by gynae with the final decision that it's just one of those things.  Do mention it at your next check up but I think it's more an issue if you are also taking eg letrozole etc that are only for post menopause.  I also get no symptoms from zoladex alone, they kicked in when I started the tablets after the 3rd injection.  You could consider an oophorectomy - my onc prefers the injections and I've had enough surgery so plod on with the jabs!  Lisa",
