      "Content": "Thanks Judyr58   I will certainly let them know about the tingling, pins and needles.     I go back for assessment in a week.   Dosen't matter how much you get told, or what information you gather, you never know until you go through it and then realise how much or little it effects you personally.   Just have to way it all up.       Just ironic that the preventative treatment causes more symptoms than was there before surgery.    Hugs!",

      "Content": "Hi,  wonder if anyone is on Abraxane and what your experiences are? I had Mas in July, and then onto FECT, however, after muga scan FEC was recommended, so T was recommended.   Then had a severe reaction to T after a couple of minutes of  the first dose.  So recommendation was for Abraxane.  Am now on the first one.   Chemo unit said no one on this chemo with BC but is on pancreatic.",
