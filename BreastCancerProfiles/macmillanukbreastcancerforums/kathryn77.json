      "Content": "Hi Mary Well done, I told my 5 year old twins after I had my long hair cut off. We read the book \"Mummy's Lump\" and then I told them the reason why I cut it off was that I would be having medicine which would make it all fall out. I told them I sent my hair to a charity that make wigs for little girls who lost their hair having the same medicine.   I then let them help me choose a headscarf at the hospital and I also got an NHS wig, but found that they really don't care what I wear (or not as at home and on holiday at Center Parcs in the swimming pool I went bald), in fact quite often when I am talking to people with my headscarf or wig on the children will say \"did you know - my Mummy's got no hair\". One of my children's classmates also asked why I was wearing a headscarf and I told them I was having medicine which made it fall out and it was just a bit cold to go without a scarf on my head. I know my children talk openly with their friends and teachers about it all and I feel we have approached it in the right way. Good luck with the chemo. Best wishes and take care.",

      "Content": "Hi Danielle I had my lumpectomy on the 6th June with one sentinel lymph node removed.  I had chemo prior to surgery. I had long hair and decided not to use the cold cap, the drugs I was to have on chemo were a certainty of it falling out (EC) and my chemo would take about an hour however with the cold cap this would be 4 hours in the hospital and I decided I didn\u2019t want to make it a whole day thing. I had heard it wasn\u2019t pleasant like ice cream head all day but there are plenty of people who do use it so I don\u2019t think it could be that bad. I would say at the hospital for chemo about 30-40% use the cold cap. I\u2019m sure you can start having it and change your mind if you find you don\u2019t like it. I cut my hair off prior to loosing it and sent it to a charity that makes wigs for little girls (this felt good to do something positive from something negative). I then went to the hairdressers and had it shaved off when it started to come out as it was very painful washing it with the chemo damaging the hair follicles.  I do miss my hair I\u2019m 37 and get hair envy a lot but it is starting to grow back now so I\u2019m looking forward to experimenting with hair styles while it grows.  I love the fact that showers are very quick with no hair washing or conditioning followed by blow drying and straightening it. I wear headscarfs, my wig and go bald quite a bit now. Good luck with your choice.",

      "Content": "Hi Caryn I had my last chemo on 11 May 2012 and due to have surgery on 5th June 2012, which is supposed to be lumpectomy and sentinel lymph node removal but I think the timing is the same whatever surgery you have which is approximately 4 weeks following chemo.  Then I don\u2019t know whether I\u2019m having radiotherapy, first I was told yes and now they are saying maybe not depending on the pathology results following surgery but I\u2019ve been told that will be about 4 weeks again after surgery (if I\u2019m having it).

      "Content": "Hi, I'm currently having chemo. I had 3 cycles of EC (Epirubicin & Cyclophosphamide) and have had 1 cycle of Docetaxal (I've a further 2 Docetaxals to go). I have to say it isn't as bad as I feared.  I was lucky on EC and didn't have two many side effects. I did get a couple of mouth ulcers but the nurses at the hospital gave me a fantastic mouth wash. I haven't had any since between cycle 1 and 2 and so I don't use the mouth wash but it's there if I need it. The nurses told me to tell them every side effect as there is sometimes drugs they can give you to help, even if you are thinking the anti-sickness tablets aren't working tell them they can tweak them to work. I find little things like if you can when you've had a shower I would wrap myself in towels and towelling bath robe and lie down on the bed to literally drip dry rather than dry myself (it helps that showers are quick with no hair to wash, condition, dry or indeed legs to shave!). On EC I would only really be tired between day 7 and 10 after chemo. On Docetaxal I get tired quicker so about day 4 or 5 but again start to pick up about day 10.   It is hard to get yourself back up to know you are being hit again, I made a pact with myself to buy a treat after every chemo, then I look forward to chemo as I will get a little gift to myself. I also enjoy the counting down, only 2 more to go now! ",

      "Content": "Hi, I started chemo at the end of January and I have to have 6 cycles like you.  I'm having chemo number 5 a week today.  I too had long hair and I decided not to have the cold cap and to just loose it.  I thought having the cold cap (which I've told isn't pleasant) would make me dread the day of my chemo even more than I would. I have three scarves, a wig and if I'm at home or going round to a friends for a girlie night with wine I sometimes go bald.  Yes I do miss my hair and I get hair envy but I'm looking forward to experimenting with different hair styles (some shorter than I would normally brave) while it is growing. I'm lucky I can go into work as and when I feel like it as my bosses were very supportive.  I have chemo every third Friday.  Between 1 and 2 I worked normally. Then after 2 you get more tired as you don't have 100% energy going into it like you do the first time.  I normally don't work the first week after chemo and then the second week I work 2 days instead of my normal 3 days and the last week I work my normal 3 days a week (as that is the week I have chemo so feeling pretty normal).  Part of me likes going into work to feel normal but another part of me thinks there is more to life than work and on a good day I sometimes want to go shopping or meet friends rather than be stuck at work. Hope this helps, feel free to ask if you need to.",
