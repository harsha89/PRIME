I also have Royce cotton and M&S cotton rich bras non wired. My old lady bras I call them. They\u2019re not seam free and not the most attractive but are very comfortable and miss my underarm scar.

I know I\u2019ve had a really easy ride with the Big C but really appreciate all of your experience. The tip about the silk hankie under your bra is AMAZING! I\u2019m on 11/20 with last 5 being boosts and have Bolus on my boob job scar. I\u2019ve been a bit paranoid about my bra strap rubbing that area so asked the radiographer who said go bra less (not something I do being of generous boobage). After a couple of days in a crop top and with plenty of dog walking, the scar is still great but managed to give myself a bit of joggers nipple with all the unsupported jiggling.Two days with the silk scarf and plenty of cream and I\u2019m almost back to \u2018new\u2019 normal. You guys are life (and nipple!) savers. Liz x",

I\u2019ve not actually seen my surgeon yet, just someone from his team, so I know nothing other than they removed a tumour and 2 nodes for biopsy (1 big, 1 little).  Concentrate on healing and try not to worry too much for the next 2 weeks (nigh on impossible I know).  Whatever will be will be and we will deal with it.  Big hugs Liz",

No sign of lymph node involvement but they wanted to remove a couple to check. I had a wle with snb last week and now I\u2019m stressing about them having to go back in and remove more. Scary isn\u2019t it.  Thinking about everyone in a similar situation but it\u2019s heartening to read how others have dealt with it before us. Best wishes Liz x",

They seemed surprised that I hadn\u2019t been told that clips had been put in when they removed the tumour to mark where it had been. Mine are in there for good now apparently but shouldn\u2019t set off any security alarms! Definitely a postcode lottery for information. Liz x",
