      "Content": "Hello all, Well, I was due to start chemo tomorrow but it's been postponed as I've ended up with an infection and a seroma. The surgeon drained the seroma which didn't hurt at all at the time. However, now I'm in a lot of pain. Is that normal? The needle was bloody massive so I suppose it's a bit like the discomfort after the biopsy. Anyone else have quite a bit of pain after theirs? I've got another week of antibiotics and hopefully then I'll be well enough to get chemo. I just want to get this out of the way now. Bit down in the dumps tonight. Going on a chocolate hunt! X",

My decision was taken away after they found a second tumour in the same breast and have recommended I have a mastectomy. With that said, I had planned to ask for one even if they offered the lumpectomy. I would always be frightened of it coming back.. I've opted for a reconstruction to be done at the time to save future skin grafts etc. maybe you could have a chat with one of the nurses here who can give you unbiased info and help you to come to a conclusion you are comfortable with.

      "Content": "Hi there, Sorry to hear your having a hard time. I was diagnosed in August and since then have had ivf, a mastectomy with recon and am now 1 chemo into my 6. I run my own wedding dress making business and really struggled with what to do regarding work. I decided in the end that my health was far more important and that I really wouldn't be providing my best service to customers if I did continue which would be detrimental to the business long term. I finished my last wedding dress on Sept 6th and haven't looked back since! Once I'd made the decision to give myself a break, I felt a huge weight lift off of me. I was a workaholic too, and at 32 didn't think anything would stop me from achieving my goals. Funny to think that in 2 short months, my entire outlook on life has changed! I'm in the process of applying for Employment support allowance and I am also going to apply for the Macmillan grant. Things will be tight for us but it's not forever and when I can commit myself again, I'll be strong and ready to get back to it! Please be kind to yourself and remember that you are not superhuman. The best thing you can do for you (and those who count on you) is to get better! Dee Xxx",

I think I'm reading too much into preparing for chemo and freaking myself out a bit. I will endeavor to go with the flow as much as my OCD type brain will allow.  Hope you are happy and well  Dee xxx ",

This is a link to me of the forums but if you google 'fasting before chemo' there is a huge amount of info. http://community.breastcancer.org/forum/69/topic/804844 I'm seeing the doctor on Tuesday so will ask her opinion before I decide if I'll try it. There seems to be a lot of merit in looking at the types of foods we eat around the times of treatment too, but, I have a feeling this is going to be easier said than done when I'm actually going through it. Saturday night and I'm lying here thinkng about this. How exciting am I?",

What you've described sounds manageable and you've really put my mind at ease. I'll be stocking up on the mouthwash, spray (your church yard story made me giggle) and lots of healthy snacks and dvds. I'm self employed too so have slowed everything down with my business until I know how I'm going to cope with each cycle so no stress in that area luckily.  I'll find out tomorrow when my first session will be and I'll try my very very best to be as relaxed as possible about it.  Thanks again, Dee xxx ",

My mum has had great success in using fasting to lose weight and increase her overall health. I wondered if any of you have tried this and it helped reduce any of the known side effects chemo brings? I'm finding out in Tuesday when my chemo will start and am clutching at straws to avoid the associated illness that comes alongside it... Any opinions/experiences would be most welcome.

Initially, I was offered a lumpectomy but after more tests, another tumour was found in the same breast so they decided on the mastectomy with immediate reconstruction. I was given a mesh/implant reconstruction and so far, so good. It's a fair bit smaller than I am on the other side but I'll get a reduction on that side once treatment has finished. I believe the recovery time is a little longer having the recon done at the same time but the bonus is, I didn't need any skin grafts as they cold use my original skin and muscle for the op. i also didnt want to deal with having no breast at all at any point. This is a lot to cope with as it is, feeling 'normal' was really important to me. Have they told you how much longer you'd need to wait for chemo if you got the reconstruction?

I have my appointment to see the chemo doctor on Tuesday but they've indicated it will only be 2 or 3 weeks until my first session. My BC nurse took me to see the chemo room and I was amazed at the lovely atmosphere in there. It was a nice bright room with lots of chatter going on. Everyone was drinking tea and eating sandwiches. A massive contrast to the image I had in my head. I chatted to an older lady who was on her 6th session and she was lovely. She looked really well and told me it was nowhere near as bad as everyone thinks it'll be. She just let herself sleep more whe she need to! I love sleep so that works for me :) Do you know when your surgery will be? Dee Xxx",

That was removed after an infection and was replaced with a tissue expander. Unfortunately, the infection made me really ill and the wound didn't heal. I had to have it operated on again and the stratice and expander were both replaced. This time my health was much better and I really focused on resting, eating well and listening to my body. I went on a super high protein diet with loads of dark green veggies and oily fish.   Finally, my wound healed and I've had no more problems since.  I know it's a knock and going for more surgery is not what anyone would want but it's the best thing that happened. My poor body was fighting so hard to heal, I was constantly unwell. Now, I can focus on getting through the rest of treatment and when I'm strong and we'll, I'll get another implant.   Best of luck for tomorrow. I hope you heal well soon Xxx",

I had my results today too and like you and getting ready to go for chemo, radiotherapy, 2 years of zoladex and 5 years of tamoxifen. You won't be alone going through this! I was told right from the start I'd be getting chemo based on the size of my tumour so I've come to terms with that. I think once it sinks in and you get used to it, it'll be easier for you. Remember you're not doing this all at once so just deal with one thing at a time. I hope you've got a good network of support around you. My friends and family have been wonderful and I've found that if I ask for help, people are only to happy to oblige. Take some time to do something nice for youself and listen to your body. If its telling you to sleep, do it! Thinking of you Dee Xxx",
