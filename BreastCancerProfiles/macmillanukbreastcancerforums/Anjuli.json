      "Content": "Hi all, I have been following the Kadcyla issue for some time now as it is my next drug...  I was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer, now in my liver too, six and a half years ago. I have had many chemo drugs and am currently on  Lapatinib and Capeciterbine which I have been on for three and a half years!! My onchologist is very surprised I am doing so well, so I am looking forward to Kadcyla and hope to do well on that too. I have a good quality of life and suffer very little side effects.  I am shocked that this is being possibly withdrawn as it is a wonder drug and we need people like me to be on it to see how successful it is. Apparently after its patient the cost goes down significantly, in about 6 years, far too late for me..... Let's hope the government debate next Thursday gives us good news. X",

      "Content": "Hi Carolyn, Thanks for replying. I am new to this site. I saw my MP Ian Stewart Tuesday and he is going to talk at the parliament debate (I spoke to his secretary this morn) and he is going to talk about me. I have put the petition on my FB page and it has got loads of signatures and shares. It's also on twitter. I will start a new thread and will try to send it to you privately.  I agree we need to get it out there and make the most of it being in the news. There was a programme on it last week. The Victoria Devonshire show I believe BBC 2. It should,be on catch up and worth watching.  Best wishes Anjuli",
