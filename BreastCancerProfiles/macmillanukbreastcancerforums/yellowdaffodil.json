      "Content": "Hi Muldoon I can\u2019t say whether leaving chemo out was the best thing as I\u2019m not a doctor or a statistician, but I felt for myself any slight chance of it not coming back was best for me.   I will say that I was fit and well and have no real health problems other than the giant turkey, breast cancer.  What I will say is that you need to do what you think is best for yourself.  Chemo comes with lots of side effects that seem to affect those areas that are already weaknesses worse, for example my teeth ached during docetaxol, so there are no guarantees that chemo wouldn\u2019t have affected your lungs if they were weak and made them worse.  You yourself had to weigh those options, as we all do, to decide what treatment would be best for you and if your decision was no chemo then no chemo it is.  There is no right or wrong answer.  There is no guarantee that it won\u2019t come back with or without chemo,  we just have to do what we think is best for ourselves and let time dictate what will happen.  We need to move on after treatment but also be in tune with our bodies so if there are any other signs we can get it checked out ASAP to either put our minds at rest or get treatment early. Sorry I couldn\u2019t give you a definitive answer on your question but I just wanted to say I believe you did what was best for you in the circumstances. Hugs Xx",

      "Content": "Hi Harridamen Wish I\u2019d thought of that.  Brilliant way of making a positive out of a negative. Have you asked for things for the stomach cramps.  After the indigestion of the first time I have been taking omeprazole to line stomach, domperidone for anti sickness, Rennie 10 min before food to protect oesophagus.  It seems to be working.  Still feel nauseous and have other side effects but it helps.   My oncologist also changed some medication before second chemo which help with migraines.  So it always worth telling them about your problems as they may be able to make it easier next time. Hope you enjoy your third week Take care Hugs xxx",

      "Content": "I'm currently sat at home feeling sorry for myself.  Kids have gone to school and husband is working away this week, back tomorrow. It's the 5th day after chemo on Friday.  I seem to get down around this time as it happened on the 1st lot as well.  My shoulder blades and upper chest have ached for 24 hours now.  Told nurse and she said to call her back if I become short of breath.  This is because I've already had one clot in right shoulder due to portacath and am now on blood thinners each day. My hair has started shedding and I'm wondering whether to get it cut even shorter than the short bob I have now.  No serious bald patches yet but I think by the end of the week there may be a few.  A little scared to go out and about as I've got no one with me at the moment, although I know it will make me feel so much better just to get out. Normally I'm quite positive but this time it has hit me for six, hopefully by the weekend I'll feel more like myself.   Can't believe what a moan a lot I'm becoming.  ",

      "Content": "Hi everyone  It looks like I\u2019m finally joining the radio group after having finished docetaxol chemo on Friday.  I am so glad that is over. My initial appointment is on 25th for measuring and to learn the the technique of breathing as my breast cancer is on the left side, so I\u2019m unsure yet whether I\u2019ll probably be more of a July radiotherapy girl rather than June.  But the end is now in sight. I have been told that I\u2019ll be having 4 weeks of radiotherapy so fingers crossed I\u2019ll be finished completely by August. yay. I am now looking forward to getting fit again as there was no point with the chemo as when you just felt better and on your feet again you were due some more.   So the question I have is which type of exercise will be best to start the process during radiotherapy.  I will start walking regularly and possibly some gentle exercises at gym, but is it possible to run or does the soreness and tiredness become an obstacle. Would love to do the park run again as I have lots of friends there. Just looking to get back to normal now Hugs xx",

I made me feel cleaner, whether it's a PLACEBO effect for me or not, the next day my scalp was a normal pink again and my hair stopped falling out for a little while.  I have now done this a few times and it seems to work or at least make me feel better. As for the hair on the legs, well I'm with you on that, I've had to shave several times through the 3 FEC's I've had.  I thought at least I'd not have to do that throughout this, but alas it's not to be. ;) Good luck on your next chemo Lots of hugs xx",

      "Content": "Just to let people know a port is not necessarily the best thing to have especially when they are trying it out in an arm. How they are in the chest I don't know, but I suspect the veins there, are slightly larger. I had a port implanted into my arm which caused a slight bleed the day before my first lot of chemo.  The nurses said they wouldn't use it because of the huge bruise that encompassed the top of my arm.  So I had my first fec through the vein at the wrist.  It then took the nurses three weeks and three flushes to get the port working properly.  In the meantime I developed a blood clot at the top of my arm whereby I was then put onto daily injections of clexane.   The oncologist said I needed to keep it in as with FEC it can seriously hurt your veins.  So after the next two lots of FEC they took it out.  Now I have yet another huge bruise, still have the blood clot and still taking clexane; until my arm begins heal and turn back to the pale colour it used to be instead of the slightly swollen red, bluish colour it is now. Whilst it was in the arm it wasn't uncomfortable or annoying.  What was annoying and hurt were the symptoms caused by the clot.  If I hadn't had complications I'm sure it would have been perfect for the job (trying to provide balanced argument).  Personally if given a choice I would ask for it in the chest as these are more frequently done so I'm assuming there would be less complications.  On the negative side you'd have a small scar on the chest instead of inside the arm. Anyway I'm hoping the clot will now clear with the clexane and that the T cycle in a week or so isn't too bad.  fingers crossed. :) Hugs for everyone.  xx",
