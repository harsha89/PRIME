    "Content": "Thank you for such a positive missive to those of us that are doing chemo this month - I had my first today & was terrified ... particularly as I had to wait 10 weeks since my surgery (mastectomy) as the implant became infected (long story) the cold cap was initially excruciating but I hung on ... & the rest was relatively easy  a lovely friend held my hand throuout - I\u2019ve got a lot of meds to help avoid nausea & so far that\u2019s ok - slightly head achey at first - (may have been the freezing of the head ) & I\u2019m ok now in bed post early supper warm & relaxing  Might I experience things getting worse in the nxt day or so ? Or weeks ? (Plan EC x4 cycles then Paclitaxal x4 cycles : total 20 weeks )  Thank you so much for reading  Krissi ",
