      "Content": "Hi Annie, Sorry to hear about your cancer and lung mets, hope the chemo does work and they shrink. I have lung mets from bowel cancer the nodules are scattered on both lungs, have had 10 chemo sessions got 2 to go , then  a scan to see if they have changed. They had'nt in April after 6 sessions. It does worry me as my nurse said my onc likes to keep you on chemo but I need a break and get away, your body can only take so much. I am staying positive and hope one day thet will find  a cure. Good luck with treatment be nice to keep in touch to see how we are both doing, Take care, Pam x   ",
