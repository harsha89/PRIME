      "Content": "Yey! Me too, I just had my last chemo last Thur (I hope I can safely say, ever!).  Well done on the T, I ended up going back for another FEC.  I'll be so pleased when these bloody injections are finished too and I can draw a line under the whole chemo malarkey.  It sucks that you need rads, I'm lucky enough to skip that side but other than that...I'm walking your walk  xx",
