      "Content": "Hi,  I\u2019m new to the group.  Recently been diagnosed with high grade DCIS and awaiting further test results on two further areas of concern.   Been warned that due to the position of the DCIS that I\u2019m likely to need reconstruction and radiotherapy or possibly a mastectomy and reconstruction which would not require radiotherapy.   There is so much factual information out there but if anyone has any advice from personal experience with similar diagnosis it would be much appreciated?  ",
