      "Content": "Hi Clarkie 13 You\u2019ve done the right thing telling your hubby and seeing the GP. I kept my lump to myself for a couple of weeks last October whilst I was trying to work out in my head if it felt the same the other side, was it my age (49), I wasn\u2019t exactly sure what normal was meant to feel like. When I told my hubby, he insisted I made an appointment ASAP to get it checked out. The GP referred me to the breast clinic due to my age (lol), if I was 25 she to,d me she wouldn\u2019t bother! My clinic appointment didn\u2019t come through until December about 5 weeks later and then I had a mmamgram one week, ultrasound and biopsy the following week. Due to Christmas and new year it meant I didn\u2019t get my results until early January.  I did have early stage breast cancer and it\u2019s been an awful few months of tests waiting, more tests , more waiting not to mention the continuous worrying etc but these clinics are amazing. The staff are there to support you and it was stressed right from the beginning that breast cancer today is treatable and that they they would do their very best to take care of me which they have. Obviously some lumps turn out to be nothing but until it\u2019s checked out you won\u2019t get that peace of mind.  This forum has been a life saver for me to ask questions and also just read up on what others are going through, showing me I\u2019m not alone and that others are far worse off than me. Whatever your results may be you will get through it so in the meantime take care and let us know how you get on. Sending hugs Helen xx",

      "Content": "Hi I had an implant 8 weeks ago, it looks natural ie you can\u2019t see the outline of the implant - I think it sits under some of my chest muscle at the top and then there\u2019s a mesh covering the lower half. I didn\u2019t ask many questions . On the day of my surgery consultant mentioned an expander implant but I felt it was too late in the day to be changing plans plus I just wanted it over and done with.  It obviously feels a bit weird but I kept my nipple so it still looks like a normal boob.  Recovery was fairly quick and my only concern is that it\u2019s too small, at least a cup size smaller than my healthy breast so I\u2019ve been wearing some inserts in my bra to fill it out - bought a pack of 12 from Amazon.  Good luck with your surgery Helen xx",

Hoping to keep my nipple, well i\u2019ll have it for a little bit unless the biopsy comes back unfavourable then it will have to go.  It\u2019s been a big decision for me to make but after 3 months of going back and for excisions, waiting for results and all the associated stress I think i\u2019ll Be glad to get it done. My BCN showed me pics of the recons that my consultant had done and I was surprised at how good they were - in most cases it was hard to tell which was the reconstructed one. You are very young so imagine your boobs are in good condition anyway. I\u2019m 49, and have had 2 children, breast fed both and apparently my boobs are in good shape taking all that into account lol!  Also saw a private plastic surgeon who showed me some of his pics and again the results are really very good. My surgeon is going to go in through the side and slightly under my breast (I\u2019m a C cup).  I know i\u2019ll have one slightly perkier than the other but I\u2019ve been told that in the future I can have the other one lifted to match up if I\u2019m that concerned.  One of the ladies on here told me that her surgeon told her they won\u2019t exactly be twins but they will be sisters - that did make me smile. Not sure if this has been any help but I wish you all the best. Take care of yourself  Helen xx Ps my main concern is the lack of feeling which I think will be the hardest thing to get used too.",

      "Content": "Hi Tracey I had mx with immediate implant 4 months ago, a Diep wasn\u2019t an option for me as I\u2019ve had previous abdominal surgery. As you\u2019re having  both you will be symmetrical which I am definitely not only having had the one. It does look really good and I asked to keep my nipple which my surgeon agreed to providing she biopsied it and it was clear. My only issue is that it\u2019s smaller than my healthy breast and I have to be honest it feels weird,  difficult to explain the feeling - sort of numb but sensitive to touch as well. I don\u2019t like looking at myself but that\u2019s due to them looking so different not because my new boob looks awful because it doesn\u2019t. It is very firm feeling and doesn\u2019t move, so you would end up with a lovely matching  pair of perky boobs. i was told to wait 6 months before I decided to have any further surgery as it takes that long for the implant to settle. I do think I will go and see a plastic surgeon to see about matching mine up better as not being symmetrical does upset me but that\u2019s my personal opinion. I healed quickly after the op, the worst part is the drain but as soon as that comes out you\u2019re up and running. I used a silicone gel on my scar too which smoothed it down and faded it quite quickly. Hope that helps a bit. Helen x ps I had high grade DCIS and I didn\u2019t need any further treatment after the mx either ",

It looks good, ( I asked to keep my nipple), it\u2019s not the same same as my \u201cgood\u201d boob and is definitely smaller so I  sometimes wear an insert in my bra to even things up - depending on what I\u2019m wearing. I recovered quickly and don\u2019t really have any lasting effects from the surgery. I would like to have a bigger implant I think but will see how I get on after my first check up. Good luck with your operation xx",

Cosmetically it\u2019s looking good at the moment, slightly smaller than my other one but not enough to make a difference in a bra. Was given the option on day of surgery of having the implant that you can adjust but I\u2019d already had a lumpectomy, a SNB plus a further excision so I wanted it all over and done with. Wasn\u2019t particularly happy that they gave me a different option on the actual day of surgery and it was the first time that it had been mentioned - decided going with original plan was best option for me. All the best for your surgery. Helen x",

      "Content": "Hi JayJ I was diagnosed with DCIS just over a 12 month ago. Had 2 lymph nodes removed and a lumpectomy, not enough clear margins so a further excision a month later. Still not enough of a clear margin so was advised to have a single mastectomy with immediate reconstruction using an implant. Only stayed in hospital overnight, did have the drain in for 2 weeks which was the worst thing to deal with. Pain wasn\u2019t too bad after a couple of days only took paracetamol and ibuprofen. Was advised not to drive for 6 weeks which was quite frustrating because once my drain was out I felt great and wanted to get out and about.  I didn\u2019t need any radiotherapy nor chemotherapy and was back doing most things after a few weeks. You will need to take things easy especially using the arm the side of the mastectomy but do all the stretches and exercises that they recommend. Like the others have said write a list of questions and take them with you, that\u2019s what I did. All the best for your surgery and a speedy recovery. helen x",

Had my mx 4 weeks ago tomorrow and kept my nipple with the proviso that it would be biopsied and then removed at a later date if need be. I have an appointment at the hospital tomorrow and assumed I\u2019d get my results then. I had high grade DCIS and went through 2 excisions and a SNB prior to the mx. So I was hoping that I\u2019d get away without any further treatment. It seems like there is no guarantee of that being the case then. Like you I\u2019m just getting used to my new boob and am pleased with how it looks, I really don\u2019t want to have to go through any more at this stage. I was diagnosed at the beginning of January after finding a lump back in October.  Maybe I won\u2019t have full results back tomorrow.  They did say that by having the mx I would avoid radiotherapy, did they tell you this too?
