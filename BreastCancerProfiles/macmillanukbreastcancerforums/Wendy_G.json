    "Content": "Hi Flower, i have finished chemo and am now having radiotherapy, but like you, I felt sick approx 4 hours after the first treatment.  Being sick for two days really takes it out of you.  Before my fifth cycle of chemo i saw a specialist nurse who prescribed EMEND, an antisickness tablet.  This is taken approx 1 hour before chemo and then one tablet for the next two days.  Emend made one hell of a difference to the way I felt after chemo.  Perhaps when you see someone next you could ask them about it.  I was only disappointed that they had not given it to me sooner. Losing your hair is one of the hardest side effects of chemo.  Having finished chemo i am impatiently waiting for mine to grow back - I want it - like yesterday!!!!   I wish you all the best, and believe me, you will get through this.
