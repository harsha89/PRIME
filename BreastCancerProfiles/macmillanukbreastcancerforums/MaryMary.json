      "Content": "Like you, I'd wondered how I'd feel about the loss of my breast and whether or not I'd feel bereft. Actually I didn't. To be honest, I wouldn't be averse to having an Mx on the other side to even me up! I wonder whether it depends on how we feel about our boobs before treatment? I was never particularly attached to mine as I've always felt they're too big, but perhaps someone who likes their boobs would find losing one harder?",

I've just finished chemo (FEC-D) and my fingernails have been very painful with the last dose of Docetaxel.  Has anyone else had this and, if so, how long will it last?  I read on here that someone was losing their fingernails so I hope the pain isn't a sign that that's going to happen.  ",

Yvonne's right: all the ladies on this site can imagine exactly what you're going through and we really hope your fears will prove unfounded.  If by any chance they don't, you WILL cope - you'll find strength you didn't know you had. I can't really add to what Yvonne's said, but I just want to let you know that we're all rooting for you. Sending a big hug, Mary  ",
