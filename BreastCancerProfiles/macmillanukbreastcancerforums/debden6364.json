      "Content": "Hiya! I tried the cold cap and it worked for me. It'ssupposed to work better with fine hair, which mine is. I askedon the first go, what were my chances of success and was told 85/95%. Make sure you cover your hair in conditioner. Comb it through. It's just to stop the cold cap sticking to your hair. Also make you cover the tops of your ears and anywhere the cold cap touches your skin otherwise you can get frostbite! There are two caps to wear. The gel filled cap that gets chilled and an outer cap just keep the first cap in place. It should be very tight, there's straps to pull and the strap under the chin can be tight too. You will look incredibly silly because the caps are usually bright pink. You resemble a jockey! My friends saw my pics and started placing bets! It gives you a massive headache (you can take two paracetamol about an hour before) It does take a long time 45 mins before your treatment and an hour after. It can be quite fiddly for the nurses so quite a few won't offer it to you so ask. I had long blonde hair and got it cut to shoulder length. I got the voucher for my wig. I tried the wig on but it wasn't for me. I washed my hair once a week with Simple shampoo and Simple conditioner. I didn't blow dry it and I gently brushed it. My hair thinned and shedded a bit but not significant. I kept my eyebrows but lost my eyelashes. I would definitely recommend it! Debbie x",

      "Content": "Hello! Recently diagnosed with grade 3 breast cancer after my first mammogram. It's also in my Lymph nodes though I don't know how many yet. My tumour is quite big. I am due to have a masectomy on my right breast on 23rd July. Now my left breast is hurting? What are the chances of it spreading? I don't know if it's my mind playing tricks. Should I be worried though? Thanks for reading. xx",
