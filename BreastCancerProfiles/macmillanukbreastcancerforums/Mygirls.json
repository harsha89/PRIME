      "Content": "My mum had breast cancer 4 years ago. She had radiotherapy and an operation to remove the cancerous cells, she was given the all clear. She has been taking hormone tablets and attends yearly momograms. She had her 4th yearly momogram on Tuesday and has received a letter today asking for her to attend another appointment for another monogram for different views. This hasn't happened before and we are all so worried. Has this happened to anyone else? ",
