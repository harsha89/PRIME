    "Content": "Hi everybody I went to doctors last Wednesday as I found a lump in my right breast the doctor referred me to breast clinic as she called it a mass under my skin since I've been I've found another lump in other breast and my arm pit has swollen I don't know if I should go back to doctor as she said there's nothing they can do for me as I need to be seen at clinic. What should I expect at my first appointment the doctor said they would do a scan and biopsy and also should I take someone with me thanks vickyÂ ",
