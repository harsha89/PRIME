    "Content": "Hi. JMCO4, Like you, I am concerned about BRCA genes but have few female relatives. I was diagnosed with TNBC aged 61. I believe in USA they screen up to 60. I have decided to spend £500 on private genetic test as i also have an ovarian cyst and grandchildren. Some TNBC treatment is only available if you have BRCA genes, too, so it seems worth the financial sacrifice. My gynaecologist is referring me. Hope this helps-but I know not everyone has £500 to spare. ",
