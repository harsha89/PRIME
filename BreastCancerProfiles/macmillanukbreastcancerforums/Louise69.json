I suppose I should have thrown more questions at him but it kind of took me back abit as chemo has never been mentioned before. It's always the way you think of loads of things once you have left. I feel upst to tell you the truth because is radiotherapy going to be enough to make sure it's gone...  Like you said they are the experts... Why ask me.... ? I wish you well with your appointment, make sure you make a list of questions to take with you. I didn't because I thought I knew what they were going to say.... Louise X  ",

I went in thinking I knew my treatment plan : Radiotherapy for three weeks and tamoxifen for five years according to my surgeon whom I have alot of faith in. My oncologist confirmed the tamoxifen and radiotherapy for three and a half weeks !!!   but having chemo was up to me as I am over 40  ( I'm 43 ) and he would give it if I wanted it, had I have been under 40 he would have done it anyway. Where did that come from? No one has every mentioned chemo before. I had a lumpectomy and sentinel node biopsy four weeks ago.  Results were clear margins with no node involvement. Lump was small under 2cm. I just feel lost now...  Do I need chemo?  Oncologist just looked at me and said 'it's up to you'..... 'we have probably already got it all'.... What do you lovely ladies think? Louise X",

I hope my BC nurse will be able to make things clearer for me Monday. Kicking myself now for not coming out with all the questions going through my mind now....

I really do not know what to think, it may well be down to the stage and grade which has been pointed out in this thread.  Mine was grade 2 and stage 1. So like I've said was told right from the start treatment would just be surgery, tamoxifen and three weeks radiotherapy. So that's why I still can't get my head around the comment from the oncologist ' I wasn't going to give chemo unless you want it, it is your choice. '  I'm a night manager in Tesco, how do I know what is the best course of treatment for me !!  I think no one would opt for chemo through choice but would through necessity of beating this bloody awful disease. Perhaps I will wait for my BC nurse to call on Monday with the broken down version of his notes, she may well be able to describe to me why chemo has come onto the radar now. Louise X",

My arm did swell the first night home but seems ok now, I've had more problems with the dressings than the wounds themselves, they brought me out in sores and blisters !!!!  so we removed them at home the day after op, I did check with gp just to make sure that it was ok. Wasn't given a list of can do's and can't or time lines. My BC nurse did say not to hoover. I couldn't help myself yesterday thou my boys just don't get the cleaning thing... lol.  I phoned our car insurance company who said no time line on driving just that it's ok to drive when  you feel you are in full control of the car. My 10 year old was going to help lots but seems to have had enough of that now so never mind typical boy... lol Going to try and walk the dog today not done that myself since last Thursday. I'm in Norfolk not far from Norwich. Louise x",
