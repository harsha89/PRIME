    "Content": "hello i am new to this as well , i have had a bilateral masectomy in july ,i went down the tuesday,and was back home on the thursday,i have had clearance of my lymph nodes on one side,which does restrict movement a little but with all the exercises that the breast care nurse gave you does help tremendously.i was awake after the op,but very sleepy.on the wednesday was just drifting in and out of sleep.mostly awake though.the drains in both sides of my body ,i didnt like much,but you can walk with them,which i only went to the toilet as i had 3 bottles on one side and 2 on the other,dont get me wrong they are not painful,just annoying having them there.i chose to have the masectomies b4 chemo,so now i start my chemo on the 8 sep.the scarring does look awful at first but when you see the nurse to have dressings taken off,it looks a lot better than what you thought.you will be fine ,take care,if you need to know anything else that i think i can help you with ,the please feel free to write to me ,from flop[carol]",
