    "Content": "Hi I had a mastectomy and implant reconstruction Friday 8th Dec 2017 and I was exactly the same as you, I would do the school run chat to the mums and they would tell me I\u2019m taking everything so well and can\u2019t believe how calm I was with the operation coming up and most of the time I would be fine and carry on as normal, then out of nowhere I would start panicking, someone only had to be nice to me and I would burst into tears. If you have days when all you want to do is sit and cry , then do it , it is such a good release and we are only human after all. I was shitting ( sorry) myself the day of the operation especially when I had to leave my husband and go down to the operating theatre with the nurse, but I knew when I woke up the cancer would be gone. The operation now seems like a piece of cake, the drains are a pain the arse I\u2019m not going to lie, but you get used to them and ask you Macmillan nurse for one of the pretty shoulder bags to carry them in, make movements and life so much easier. I had op on the Friday , was discharged on the Monday , one drain removed that day and they other one stayed in for a further 9 days. Any questions please ask. Just remember you can do this. Xx",
