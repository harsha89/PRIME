    "Content": "Hello Tracey, My Breast cancer came back last year after 7 years - I too was premenopausal. I had already been on tamoxifen for 5 years and it was a year after I stopped it that it came back. Being hormone positive, my oncologist has put me on monthly Zoladex injections to turn off my ovaries and a daily tablet of Letrozole. So far all is going fine (touch wood). Has your oncologist mentioned this treatment as an option? The only side effects that I have are hot flushes. Best wishes to you.",
