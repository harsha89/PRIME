    "Content": "wombat.23 Hi, Had some bad news yesterday. the cancer was 55mm and 14 out of 18 nodes contained cancer. This has hit me for six. I am finding it hard to get my head around this and I am so scared - such a high number! Chemo and radio are for definite now, probably after Christmas. Just starting to feel better after surgery, and now this. Hiya I was diagnosed in march had mastectomy and lymph node removal, the lumps were 42mm,22mm,19mm and 11mm...and I had 16 lymph nodes removed 14 were cancerous...iv had chemo and radiotherapy, I can honestly say after the shock like you, you do deal with it I stayed as positive as I could I kept a daily diary how I felt the ups and the downs not many of them tho.....I look back now and think how brave I was and you will get through all this , best wishes keep positive x",
