Karen...  You may well be surprised by what they don't tell you! another example - the problems of side effects with hormone therapy.in my case with anastrozole. I know we all react differently to different drugs but it is only through this site that I found out all sorts of things re anastrozole.  if you live  near or with reasonable access to a cancer centre you are really lucky,(?) they seem to offer all sorts of varied help,Courses etc., perhaps even some Outreach Courses as well, not so where I am....rural area. Another moan over!    Zen if anyone is over 60..maybe 65 they can apply for Attendance Allowance BUT you NEED Help completing the form from a  knowledgeable Welfare Benefits Officer as I was so lucky to find.   Zen",

Seems to me that where you live may offer more in Support Services than other areas such as mine.It would be good to have some consistency, and all those who need it be given Arimidex as a matter of course instead of having to go through endless barriers of one sort or another.      Thank you for sharing... everyone Zen xxxxxxxxxx",

I agree with the comments that it makes no sense to have to take 'all sorts' of other tablets to allay the side effects. You see, it all comes down to money, nothing to do with how horrible they make you feel...not right is it? Presumably we have all paid into the NHS? so why should we have to have the cheapest 'aromatose  inhibitator' that make life pretty awful, as if we havent had enough to get through!   aaaaaaaaahhhhhhh grrrrrrrrh..makes me so mad!  Should we get a petition up!!??????????LOL        love Zen xx",

I dont suppose any of us can avoid getting anxious or more anxious around these times.... I do try to do some of the things or similar things you suggest, but recently I seem to have given in.. to staying in, in the quiet and doing my own thing...probably nothing much ! thing is my studio gets quite cold and I like many others I simply cant afford too much heating..there and at home.

Also, I would like to pose the following questions which no doubt have been talked about before, so sorry to be repetitive... It seems to me that many older women like me (a very young 75!)  well their needs are not exactly being addressed say for e.g. bra catalogues seem to feature young - ish women perhaps because they cant get older ladies to be photographed?  and does anybody in the scheme of things pay any concern to those who live alone without much in the way of family, if indeed any family?

      "Content": "Hello Chris77 if I can put in my tupenny worth!!     Hair...  best for me has been 'Plantur 39 ' Shampoo Boots £8.99 or thereabouts. I use the one for fine/brittle hair, and my hair has come on a treat. They do a version for 'coloured' hair as well. I use it every other day.Highly recommended!!   Anastrozole try to get yourself on the original make called ARIMIDEX ....    The generic ones that followed  -once Astra Zeneca had to release the 'patent' I think they call it, the horrible side effects started for many of us. Seemingly it is the 'fillers'  around the anastrozole they use that cause the problems. I asked my Oncologist to prescribe it for me and she did.   If only everyone was prescribed Arimidex life would be so much easier, as I think we have enough to put up with or have had enough without these horrible side effects. You wont be surprised to know that it all comes down to 'money' ....never mind the well being of the patient, so wrong. I wish Macmillan could take up this matter with whoever? pharmaceutical industry? the government (as if!!!?) any way moan over and Good luck     Zen xx",

It was thanks to this website that I by chance found Maggie's Online Cancer Services and got lots of help on line from their benefits adviser. Please note I am not trying to upset anyone at Macmillan... just telling how it was, by chance, that I got helped financially. We all need help one way or another?     Warmest wishes     Zen",

      "Content": "Re Hair thinning    Hello all.... When I first started on Anastrozole of various makes I experienced hair thinning. I read on here about the Shampoo Plantur 39 (Boots and others! £8.99) they do  one for fine brittle hair and one for coloured hair , my hair  is fine and fair,  improved greatly, gradually with shampoo used every other day. It comes in a lime green container. However, for those that dont know I also changed the Anastrozole to the one called  Arimidex made by Astra Zenica, ICI that was, they were the original makers of the tablets. The Oncologist requested the Prescription to the Surgery.      Whether it is a combination of the 2 or just the shampoo, who knows, but the shampoo is definatly worth a try....think its  German.....!You might get some info if you just 'Google' it!!  Good luck Zenxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Also got a funny thumb! until chage of tablets!",
