    "Content": "Running a peer support group in my area, I'm constantly being asked what support there is in our area. My response is always 'very little' . However the specialist nurses keep telling other professionals that we have a great survivorship programe. grrrrrr! They are yet, however, to be able to signpost me to anything. It would be lovely to hear what there is available in your areas. Please give me hope.",
