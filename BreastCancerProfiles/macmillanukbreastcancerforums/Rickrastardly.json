    "Content": "Good afternoon. Following discussions with her consultant, my partner had the number of sessions on chemo reduced from 8 to 6 (being 3 x EC already complete and 3 x T only one completed). Unfortunately she didnt handle the new drug very well bad stomach cramps, the runs, severe headaches, unable to walk due to the pains in her legs and fatigue, so the consultant said it wouldnt be wise to continue with the 3 weekly full strength dosage and changed meds to weekly lower strength taxcil (?), for the following six weeks. She had the first session last week and apart from a \"foggy\" (her words) and achy second day all seems to be going well. My question relates to hair loss. During her treatment on EC she wore the cold cap, and fortunately managed to keep it around the sides back and fringe but lost the hair on top of her head. She lost some eyebrows and hair from, ahem, \"other\" areas on her body. I have noticed over the past couple of weeks, downy hair on her face re-appearing along with the hair on her legs, and the bald patch having an element of \"fuzz\" about it! Is this possible? Could this be the beginning of her hair regrowth? I was led to understand Docetaxel is a bit more aggresive than the EC. Next session on the lower dose is tomorrow, meaning only 4 more sessions left!",
