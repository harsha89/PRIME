      "Content": "Hi I had 3 EC treatments without major side effects but T was a different story for me!The first treatment was worse and the oncologist reduced the next 2 treatments by 20%.The main issues I had was thrush, a thick white coated tongue which caused awful tastes or no taste which lasted for ages,  I had a reaction to the antibiotics which caused added problems to the thrush and made me agitated and unable to sleep, I was unable to go to the loo and had the usual joint and muscle pains which were actually worse after my final treatment!  I prepared for the last 2 treatments by taking Laxido on the day of chemo and used 1 a day for about 6 days to try and keep going to loo, I used prescribed mouthwash regularly and started fluconazole for the thrush which was increased to 10 days from 7 and startied the day after Chemo, the antibiotic was also changed and was reduced to 7 days instead of 10 and ended at the same time as fluconazole which was for the thrush! Also fresh pineapple helped! I still had some side effects but they were then more manageable! I would suggest trying to spread your tablets out so you can identify like I did that the antibiotic I was taking was adding to the problem instead of helping!Other minor things were runny eyes which I was given eye drops for and I took antihistamines, also heart burn with 1st treatment which Lansoprazole helped with this! I'm sure you will be fine and get through it! The first treatment is usually worse as you don't know what to expect!Make a note of all your side effects if any and tell the doctor so further medication can be prescribed or changed! I Hope it goes ok for you x",

      "Content": "Hi Thank you for your speedy reply!It sounds like you have had it tough too! I have read other people's posts but needed a bit of support myself! I have some hopeful news as will be going back to have day surgery tomorrow with a different surgeon! I cried buckets this morning on the phone to my brilliant breast care nurse!She agreed they should try other options and said I needed a second opinion! I went in to see her today as she was arranging ultra sound for more fluid to be drained, it's dr dreads surgery day today!While I was there she got another surgeon to give a second opinion!He seems to have a lot better manner about him!On looking at wound he suggested that it should be possible to put a smaller implant in and cut the dead skin underneath away he will try to  save most of nipple but may have to take it all together!If it fails then it will have to be removed!At least he is giving me a chance!I will not be even but at least some shape!He seemed suprised that the original surgeon couldn't do this!I gave him a desperate look and asked if he would do the op!He left the organisation to my brilliant breast care nurse who came back and said if I was ok with it he had a cancellation tomorrow it was one of her previous patients!Im so fed up and want some time to recover before Chemo and rads that it feels like a relief!Still worried about the outcome but not long to wait and given it a try! I am so greatful for my breast care nurse who was not happy with previous surgeon and said leave it with me I'll deal with him!So I have a new surgeon and hope to start making progress!The only down side is with Christmas I am worried if the new implant needs draining but will cross that bridge if I have to! Thank you once again and will let you know how I get on! Thanks Mandy",

      "Content": "I had a mastectomy with skin saving implant reconstruction!Nothing went right from the start!Daughter and Husbsnd were made up with cold before op!Husband started night before op so had to go to hospital with 20 yr old daughter as she had recovered and didn't want to spread germs! I had op all seemed OK and then had a bleed so taken back to theatre late the following evening!He caught the bleed but now I believe due to this the skin died!I have had to have around implant drained 3 times!Now using pico dressing for last 3 weeks!It does show some improvement but not enough for the surgeon I nick named \"doctor dread\" always gives worse case!Went for ct and scan results and said if no improvement  by next weds he wanted to whip me into surgery and remove implant the following day!Both scans were OK thankfully!I was very upset and he agreed to give it a couple of weeks reluctantly as he said there are 11 nymph nodes involved you know and don't want to delay Chemo and radiotherapy!When I had talked to oncologist she did not give impression there was a rush! Originally I was going to have immediate tummy tuck reconstruction but a couple of days before op he decided that this wasn't wise!I have Cushing's which is in remission but means I produce too much cortisol, it is a rare disease I had op for last year! I had recently stopped steroids!He said he thought there was no lymph node involvement but turned out to be 11 affected!I had 26 removed and 2 he can't get too. How long is it safe to leave Chemo and rads as I desperately want to keep implant as I don't think I will be fit for any other reconstruction due to hormones caused by Cushing's! Has anyone else used pico or delayed treatments and how long was healing process for the black dead skin? I'm at rock bottom and don't know how to cope I feel the surgeon is very cautious and even breast cancer nurse thinks this as she's worked with different surgeons' I know it's long winded but will appreciate some help!Got to go back to hospital weds to see him and then to a different hospital to see oncologist straight after!Lost all confidence and feel like something else awful will happen! Scared cancer will be in other breast don't think I can cope if that happens! Will speak to breast cancer nurse tomorrow as not in today! I'm anxious and scared Thanks if some can give info of pico and healing time etc  will be greatful",

      "Content": "Hi Yes I have a brilliant endocrine team!The oncologist already said she would liaise with him as she is aware of steroid issues and she appears to know him so hopefully it will be sorted easily enough!Thanks for the advice though!My Cushing's at present is in remission and my Cortisol levels are only slightly raised so hope it won't cause problems! Have a good Christmas and thanks for advice  Xx",
