I don't think it can be too early to do something about it, the earlier you start treating it, the better the outcome. If your consultant says you have lymph oedema in the breast then the earlier something is done about it the better. How bad does it have to be before he will refer you? I hate it when people are told they are not bad enough to be treated.",

As part of my exercises I squeeze a ball - mine's a dog toy, quite soft but firm enough to do good. Also when I flew recently I took the ball with me and squeezed the ball while resting my arm on the head rest of the seat in front. You can also get 'spiky' balls - I think they call them acupuncture balls - to roll in your hand; they'd probably help too. ",

I can't help with the pain you're getting from your meds, but exercises can help with the balance issue, and hopefully stop you falling over. I went to a gentle movement class which included exercises for balance and I have some I can do at home. I still very occasionally feel as though I'm going to fall but it's not as bad as before.

The actual procedure was decided weeks before when I saw the surgeon. I only saw my surgeon once before the operation day., approx a month before it.; there was no other contact before the pre op assessment. If you can't get hold of your BC nurse then ring the surgeon's secretary and see if you can speak to him, and keep trying the BC nurse. This is all very worrying for you, not what you need a couple of days before an op. I do hope you get it sorted tomorrow.",

I've not had my appointment through for my follow up yet so that's the next benchmark.  When we were going through a particularly bad time when my daughter was younger several people said to me 'How on earth do you cope, I couldn't'. My answer was that we coped because we had to, there was no choice, and it's true for the last 8 months. As far as I was concerned there was no choice; I wanted to live so I coped with all the side effects, somehow. There were times when I thought I didn't want to go on, but when I thought what the alternative was I gritted my teeth and put up with it.    ",

I can't say I've not touched a drop; my husband likes to have a glass of lager with his meal sometimes and I've just had a sip from his glass, but that's it. Since my treatment finished I've started to exercise. I go to the local leisure centre once, or occasionally twice a week to do an exercise programme specially for those being treated or have finished treatment for cancer. One is a gym session and the other a circuit session. I also go to the local cancer care centre once a week to do yoga, and I try to have a good walk at least once a week - we have dogs so I take them out. I now drink green tea. Cut down ordinary tea and coffee to one a day and the rest of the time I drink green tea or herbal tea. I've added nuts to my diet I want to lose weight, and am struggling to do so. I'm on Anastrozole which can make you gain weight so I watch it carefully. I'm not really gaining weight, but not losing it either. I am just on the borderline between normal and overweight so just need to lose a bit. Those are the main changes I've made and I'm sure there are lots more I could do, but they all have to be introduced slowly and one at a time or I won't be able to keep it up!",

The kinesio taping and MLD are not alternatives to the compression garments, but are complementary - or at least that's how it is for me.  I went to the clinic once a week for 3 weeks to have the kinesio tape put on. I was told to try to keep it on for 5 days then to take it off. I took my husband with me on the last one so he could see how to apply it, and I was told I could do it myself from then on. I also took photos so I knew where it was supposed to go. It appeared to be stuck on with superglue!!! My nurse said to keep a little spray bottle of baby oil (or any oil) and spray it on the tape. Leave it until it's soaked in and it comes off really easily. But I still had to wear my sleeve every day like before. Then I had MLD twice a week for 3 weeks - after the second one each week, over the weekend, they kinesio taped me as well, and I wore the sleeve just as usual. Now I'm having the laser therapy, and after the one this week I also had kinesio tape. So, don't assume that it's either/or. I found that whatever other treatment I had I still had to wear my sleeve.

At 9:40 just as I was in the shower, the phone rang. Eldest daughter asking us if we were around. Granddaughter (age 3) had declared she wanted to go and see granny and grandpa. Hooray!! Abandon all thoughts of admin. Although not a nice day, cloudy, misty etc, daughter fancied a walk on the beach. Did we want to go? My feet were hurting and I didn't know how far I'd  manage but I said I'd go if grandpa came too. So off we went, and I had a lovely time. We meandered up the beach, jumping in puddles and sliding in the mud. Little one one rode on grandpa's shoulders on the way back and loudly said \"Good morning\" to everyone we met. She makes me laugh so much so when we got back the cobwebs were thoroughly blown away and I'd forgotten all my troubles!! Not the sort of walk that helps to lose weight or get fit, but my mood and feeling of wellbeing was much improved!!",

It takes about 30secs to get to our usual walking place, and about 20 mins to walk round it at a reasonable pace. It's just taken me over half an hour to do it, due to the plodding old canine who gives a really good impression of not really knowing where she is or which way she is supposed to go. We found her straying in the mountains nearly 10 years ago. We were told then she was a minimum of 5 years old, but could possibly be 7, which makes her at least 15 and possibly 16 or 17. As well as being really old with very wobbly back legs she has dementia, so when she goes out I need to keep a good eye on her in case she forgets where she is and goes off in a different direction!  But at least I got out into the cold fresh air and feel batter for it.",

I wear a sleeve all day every day, and I was shown how to do simple lymphatic drainage exercises, and I found some other exercises on the internet that I also do. I do the exercises and the lymph drainage every day as part of a general exercise regime and the swelling has gone completely down. I'm hoping to be told at my next lymph clinic appt that I can leave the sleeve off sometimes.  I also had shoulder problems - not caused by the lymphodema, but could have been cured by a steroid injection. They wouldn't give me the injection because of the lymphodema. I was told not to allow blood to be taken from the bad arm or blood pressure taken, or any injections and I have a type of medic alert bracelet to wear. Again it's exercise that has had a good effect, and my movement is much much better. ",

Spent the morning doing loads of washing and hanging out on the line - beautiful day here and it all dried really well. Made soup for lunch, and after a 10 minute sit down decided to take the old dog to the beach. Pushed her into the car - can't lift her so she has to ride in the passenger footwell. Walked to the end of the beach and did a sort of body scan - where mentally I checked myself over to see how I was feeling. result was good, but don't go too much further! So walked round the car park climbed over the wall again and back on to the beach. Felt as though I had my second wind, still felt good when we got back to the car. After a cup of tea did my stretching exercises (yoga-ish type) and sat on the bed for a rest before supper and then out to choir. A really busy energetic day for me!!   Today I had another walk!! To the woods this time as still feeling pretty good. Photo really is from my walk, the signs really are up in our woods - don't think the council could have put them there!! See what tomorrow brings - it's Thursday so it's my dance exercise class - hope I don't collapse from doing too much as I really enjoy the class. Hope the photo has come out okay - first time I've tried it!!!",

About 9 days after the op, and feeling pretty yucky,  I woke up one morning suddenly feeling a lot better and more positive.

I've just started my radiotherapy - day 3 today - but I wasn't able to have the CT scan at first because of shoulder and arm problems and not being able to get my arm into the right position. I had to go back 4 times before they were able to do the CT scan. I had pretty intensive physiotherapy on my arm and shoulder muscles and I saw a chiropractor too. I should get on to your BC nurse and explain what's happened and ask about physio as soon as possible. Ask if your hospital also provides acupuncture, some do, if you think that might help I was also advised by the radiography team to make sure I was tanked up with pain killers before I went for the CT scan. At one attempt the consultant came up to see me and said that they can give a shot of morphine as a last resort. I can only just get my arm into the right position for the radiotherapy now as my shoulder and arm are still not right,  but they've said again that if it gets too difficult again I can have morphine.  For Monday I'd suggest you take some really powerful painkillers if you can - I take either tramadol and ibuprofen together, or cocodamol and ibuprofen together. Don't worry too much about it, it must be something they come across quite often and they have strategies for getting over it.  Talk to your BC, or radiotherapy consultant. ",

Epsom salt baths are supposed to release toxins from your body, and lots of people swear by them. Anyway, a nice warm bath is going to help relieve aching muscles and joints and I think that if you believe that the epsom salts are helping then they probably are. Himalayan pink bath salt is supposed to be really good too. Lots of chemists sell them I have some of both and would dearly love to have a bath with them. Unfortunately I now find it very hard to get out of the bath - I had a couple of \"dry runs\" a while ago and needed help to get out, so haven't tried the real thing yet. Problem for me is putting my weight on the side I had the mastectomy and pushing myself upwards out of the bath.  Your regime sounds really good, specially the water.

I was very upset that time too, just lay on the table with tears pouring down my face the whole time - not a good look! Hope your BC nurse reassures you.  ",

      "Content": "Hi littlesusie Are you being treated for lymphodema? If so I wonder if waiting quite a while to see if the swelling goes down, and stays down would be a good idea before having the ring resized, otherwise you may find that it will be too big when the swelling eventually subsides.  I had fluid in my arm and hand after my surgery - still not 100% certain it is lymphodema, but treating it as though it is. I went to the lymphodema clinic and got fitted for a compression sleeve, and a glove. I wear the sleeve every day, all day usually. I also do exercises, some given me by the lymph clinic, some I've picked up from other sources, and I religiously do these every day. The swelling in my hand disappeared very quickly, and to look at it you'd say there is no fluid there at all, although I think there is the tiniest amount there. Mine was in my right arm so my wedding ring wasn't affected. I think you've done the right thing to take it off. Sounds painful having it removed. Did the jeweller have to cut it?",

      "Content": "Littlesusie , there is a booklet by Macmillan about lymph oedema, and it's got a couple of exercises in it. You can access it online. I was given a sheet by the lymph clinic with instructions on how to do simple lymphatic drainage, there are 12 steps to it. I can't find it online, but it includes some deep breathing and moving the skin gently to help the fluid drain away from the swollen area. There are also hints on posture and things you can do while you're sitting down watching television or whatever. I'm sure that doing the arm exercises will help your hand. I was horrified when my hand swelled. I earn a bit of money by playing the piano, and absolutely couldn't have swollen fingers, so I make sure I do hand exercises even though there is now no swelling. I'm not sure I can work out how to do a link otherwise I'd put some here, not sure if it's the right thing to do to offer you a copy of my simple lymph drainage, but I'm happy to do so if you want to contact me on a private message. I'd certainly ask your lymph nurse for some exercises though. Don't feel I've been very helpful here, but there's a lot you can do to control the swelling.      ",

I was told to put cream on the radiated area straight away, they didn't recommend anything but I said I had aqueous cream and E45 and they said that was fine. I got a bit of a rash with E45 so have ended up using Aveeno cream. I think the main thing is to use unperfumed cream that is as plain as possible, and to keep it moisturised right from the beginning. Aloe Vera is good if it feels hot. Some units seem to recommend specific creams so it might be best to check if yours does, but I would advise you to start moisturising now",

I do know that some people travel long distances to get to their RT, and some have to go by public transport, so it's doable but not ideal. Ask your BC nurse to find out if you can choose to have your treatment in Bristol. Good luck.",

There was no reason why I shouldn't have showered properly, but it all hurt so much  and I couldn't bear to look at it or have anything touch it. I developed a complicated way of washing that involved getting into the shower, with my nightie still on, and showering my bottom half, using the shower hand held, with nightie knotted around my waist to stop it getting wet. Then I used a sponge to wash my top half, but avoiding the surgery area. I'm 10  weeks post surgery now and it doesn't hurt so much, but the scar area is very uncomfortable. Managing to have a proper shower now though so at least I don't smell any more! It does all get easier",

I think they like to leave approx 6 weeks after surgery before starting radiotherapy so you'll have some time to heal first. I'm now 10 weeks after surgery and waiting to start the radiotherapy -I've had some problems that have delayed it. Agree with advice re not Googling - you'll just frighten yourself. Baby wipes are wonderful, take things easy, it takes  some people quite a while to recover. Bestest advice I can give is make sure you do your exercises. ",

In one of my appointments I was told that I was borderline for getting a small size sleeve - some of my measurements were within the range for a small size - I normally have a medium. They suggested I try it and see if it was okay. It wasn't. I ripped the thing off after quite a short while; it felt as though my circulation had been cut off. Maybe yours should be the next size up? I also found that I wasn't quite putting my sleeve on properly so I asked the nurse to watch me put it on, and she pointed out a couple of things I wasn't doing properly. Can you ask your nurse to check you are putting it on correctly? I've noticed that different makes of sleeve feel different on me - some are tighter than others, even though they are the same class and size. The ones I have are Jobst. I have two prescribed every 6 months and I usually but at least one more from the Daylong website. I find them really comfortable. Hope you get to sort it out. ",

I'd had floaters for a couple of years before getting BC, they didn't bother me much - the optician told me she couldn't see anything irregular in my eyes, and that my brain would learn to filter them out, which it did. However, after I had finished all my treatment (chemo, surgery, radiotherapy) but just before I started taking Anastrozole I suddenly started to get flashing lights in my peripheral vision and the floaters got more prominent. My brain has filtered out the floaters again so they don't bother me most of the time, but the peripheral flashes are still there 18 months later. They don't bother me during the day, but I'm very aware of them when it's dark. It can't be the Anastrozole that causes them in my case. I have to go to the opthalmic dept in the hospital every year to have my eyes checked out as I'm borderline glaucoma, and last time I went I mentioned them. He said the flashes are either an optical migraine, or the natural degeneration of something in my eyes due to age, but your post has made me wonder if they could have been caused by chemo, or radiotherapy!",
