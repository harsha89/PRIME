    "Content": "I am actually going through this exact same experience right now. I've just finished 8 rounds of chemo (4 x EC & 4 x THP) last week and have noticed that my face is full of what seems like acne but its not acne as it seems all the little bumps are filled with white puss. I've been using Simple on my face but its not doing the trick so was thinking of maybe trying something like Proactiv. On top of that I have a superficial scar on my forehead I am trying to slowly exfoliate away after I had a fall after my 3rd round. Would be good to hear whether others have had any good facial skin care regimes as the more I sweat and the hotter it is the worse my face gets.",
