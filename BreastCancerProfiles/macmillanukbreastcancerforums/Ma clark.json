I had a mastectomy and clearance 6  years ago next month this was followed by chemo, radio, 5 years of tamoxifen and am now on my 3rd month of Letrozole.   What I'm wondering is why after 2 months in which I felt so much better than I had for the last 6 years am I now in such pain? paracetamol, ibruprofen and now co-codomol are not touching it the GP did blood test and physical examination all negative so is it phsyco- sematic or has any more of you peeps suffered the same and if so what did you do to get a good nights sleep? All suggestions gratefully received!!!!",
