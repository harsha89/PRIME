      "Content": "i wonder if anyone else has had this experience, i had been feeling unwell for over a year, the doctors told me there was nothing wrong with me, but both my dogs kept licking my left side, kept to heal which was unusual and also grew lumps on their left side around the breast area on a human, which thankfully after a trip to the vets was benign...at my last dr appointment, when they discharged me, i informed them about what my dogs were doing...they asked if i had had a particular test which i said i hadnt and had the reply this should have been done a year ago, but luckily as the registrar was new, he did an urgent referral and with that and my routine breast screening, it was discovered i had hormonal breast cancer in the left side...believe it or not, i was relieved i wasnt going mad...this was discovered in march 2018 ....has anyone else experienced the doggie angel intervention...i fully believe their sense of smells can detect cancer cells....",

      "Content": "Hi Violetsniff love your name, my dogs are not trained, one is a collie cross alsation the other a staffordshire bull terrior...they certainly keep me out of mischief, and they also seem to know when im down and will try either jumping on the sofa cuddling up leaning on me or put their heads on my knees, sometimes if i am not taking any notice of them, i suddenly get a paw on the knee.............dogs are very good are reading body language, im sure your friends furry angel knew she was down and just letting her know he/she is giving her a cuddle to make her better.....They have been amazing, i knew i was on the mend when they decided enough was enough and started playing down the garden or the stables, starting to give some distance, but on one my lower days, they are right back sitting on me hee hee ...the staffy is known as a nanny dog (which i recently found out) and she certainly lives up to her name...my daughter has a couple of puppies only 12 weeks old, and they also seem to know im unique or they are taking their cues from the older pups...so i would say all pups have the ability.....tell her to embrace her pup and learn from it...the pup will certainly open her eyes...your friend will also be going through the grieving process, its important that she knows that people are there for her and not to be afraid to ask for help especially during loss...sending both of you healing hugs and love ouleyÂ ",

      "Content": "Hi Ronstar i have been very fortunate with my furry angels who have been with me every step of the way..on my bad days im sat on, on good days they are off up the garden or ignore me unless they need feeding hee hee....its interesting even my feral cat has become more friendly and my ponies behave when im on a bad day but get upto mischief on my good days....i definately think animals understand and can detect more than we realise.........imi sure that there will be further research in dogs detecting different types of cancer, i think they are already involved in detecting epilepsy and diabetes....................................... With regard to my diagnosis, im a living with cancer survivor, but dont see myself as my diagnosis.........this is something i will have for the rest of my life and like everyone else we never know how long we have...but it puts priorities into perspective.. its been interestng to see how the animals react during this crazy continued journey. I hope all is well your end O",
