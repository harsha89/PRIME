      "Content": "hiya, I'm new on here. i had a mastectomy in October 2011 which successfully cleared the cancer. i am now wondering if to have breast implant reconstructive surgery. im 42 years old and currently use a fakey in my bra. I'm slightly squeamish and wonder how I'd feel with something under my skin. i need advice please if you can actually feel the implant, can you sleep on your tummy, what about surrounding tissue..as i was left slightly concave as was at the time overweight with a c cup. I've now lost weight so not so noticeable. im weighing up pros n cons of surgery and would like other views please x ",
