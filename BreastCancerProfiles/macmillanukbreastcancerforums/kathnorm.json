      "Content": "It must depend on area you live in because in Halifax they fit them on the nhs. Nearly everyone having chemo had one or the other fitted while I was having chemo. I couldn't have 1 fitted due to having a blood clotting gene. Now my veins in my hands are no good and I have a few burn marks caused by the chemo that I'll have forever I'm told. At least I'll be easily identified lol. xhugsx",

      "Content": "Hi. Just thought I'd add my experience of the cold cap. I've just had my 5th cycle of chemo today. I've used the cold cap every time and though my hair fell out in parts ( looks like i have a receading hairline lol) it only fell out in clumps after the first 2 cycles of chemo. I've not had any headaches or pain. In fact I would still wear it just to keep me cool while having the chemo. It does get warm in the hospital rooms.  I still have another 3 to 5 cycles to go before I can have my operations and I will still use it every time.  Another 2 ladies who are only 2 cycles in have decided not to continue due to the pain they have for the first 20 mins. I had long hair and due to losing a massive clump just before the 2nd cycle, I decided to shave it short. Blade no 7.  It was the hardest thing I'd ever done and even though I've to have a double mastectomy losing the hair was the hardest thing ever and I cried for day's.  Now I couldn't care less about my hair. I'm still here. I can still see my grandkids growing up and be an influence in their lives. I can spoil them and not get told off lol. I will say that the tiredness for me does get worse with each cycle of chemo. I'll probably be in bed 22 hours a day by last one. well I have to get up at some time to wind the hubby up :) I hope everyone's feedback helps. At the end of the day you don't know how your going to react though till you try it. I would advise everyone to persevere as my experience says it works after a couple of cycles.  Good luck xx",

      "Content": "Hi everyone. I have breast cancer. The cancers are in the area where I keep my phone in my bra. I have been doing this for 6 years and wondered if the mobile phone could have caused the cancers. Has anyone else had the same experience? I didn't think about it at first, I just thought I was unlucky in having it but the more I thought about it the more it seems likely. I have researched the test's done with mobile phones and no tests have been done with regards to breast cancer. Tests have been done for brain and testicular cancer which has proven inconclusive. Has anyone anyone any thoughts on this? ",

      "Content": "JD. I will be looking for work from April next year. I was made redundant through I'll health. I've still to have radiotherapy. I have had a mastectomy of the left breast 6 weeks ago. I've also to have the right one removed and reconstruction in about 12 months. I don't think a prospective employer will be happy to take on someone who has had cancer, is 58 year old and will be needing 10 weeks off within the first year of employment. I have had a cold for 4 weeks now. Coughing and sneezing. I generally feel worn out all the time and if I do something extra, I'm in bed for most of the next day. God help me when I start with the radiotherapy lol. If I was in your position, I'd wait until at least after Christmas. Just concentrate on 1 thing at a time. Kath xhugx",
