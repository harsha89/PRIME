      "Content": "Hi .... I've just finished my course of 15 rads yesterday. I was given cream by the oncologist at my 1st appointment to discuss the rads treatment. I started to use it then (4 weeks before the first treatment) and have continued 2 x a day as instructed. I too have the odd sharp pain round the nipple where the surgeon made the incision. My skin seems ok so far and I only had a faint redness from 12th rad.  I am also taking Anastrozole and am on week 5. The hot flushes are back but so far so good. I think anyway.",

      "Content": "I can sympathize. I had my WLE and sentinal node op on 21st Dec and went back in for the results on 30th Dec. The surgeon started her sentence with \"Unfortunately.....  At which point I nearly passed out. I was then aware of her saying \"we haven't had all the results back from histology\" Not the best way of giving news I must say. The results were delayed because of the back log and Christmas break so there are lots of reasons for delays. Your mind does go into overdrive with a situation where you have to wait for resuts. I had to wait until early Jan for my results, which thankfully were ok. Hang on in there xx",
