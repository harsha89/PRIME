      "Content": "Thank you so much, George and Jackie! Sorry, it's taken me a day to work out how to find your post here and reply to it!! Hahaha!  TBH it's been mentally exhausting just doing the rookie rootling around the site, trying to get used to sourcing what I want to find, and understanding how to contribute effectively.  Still mildly confused and overwhelmed at the volume of discussion and information out there, so will cheerfully carry on digging around and sifting gradually. Process wise, am just at the beginning of surfing that breast cancer wave, so not had a full diagnosis yet, just the provisional one.  Long way to go.  Currently trying to line up my logistical ducks at home so I can begin treatment confident I can get to and from the hospital, have home care ideas sorted if I need them, know which friends and family can cope, what money I'll live off, all that kind of thing.  Trying to reduce the elements of surprise to the medical only.  I know, if only. From the looks of it, blogging may prove a really useful way for me to process what is going on. Right, better start my new discussion! Cheers",

      "Content": "Hi Blue Roan I hit on your blog by accident when doing a quick trawl for experiences of breast cancer chemo, and there 'The Art of Suffering' was!  It's a brilliant blog and really helpful for its clarity and directness.  Am inspired so much, may join the blog brigade as a result.   Thank you so much and thanks to Macmillan for pointing me in your direction!  Cheers!",

      "Content": "Ah Dreamthief! Thanks heaps, that's brilliant!  It's beginning to make sense now!! Made a right hash of writing blog posts yesterday but I think I'm getting the hang of it I'll suggest all this goes into the introductory email that newbies get sent.  It would help settle people like me in a bit quicker.  The site's SO huge, though, I'm astounded how well it works considering! Right off to phone the helpline... #lovinmacmillan",
