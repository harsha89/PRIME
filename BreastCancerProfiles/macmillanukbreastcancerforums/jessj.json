    "Content": "Hi Heidi, my advice is that if you dont like your surgeon (ive had problems with my oncologist!)  you should ask to be referred to a different one.or at least for a second opinion. i would also suggest talking to a breast care nurse/ macmillon nurse about your concerns or issues with him. i have also been told that an ld flap, tram flap or diep flap do give a more natural appearance as opposed to implants. however, these are much more invasive surgery with a longer recovery time. i havent had such extensive surgery as you yet but have found out i have a brca1 mutation so i will be having a bilateral masctectomy in the near future. like you i am unsure of what type of reconstruction to have and also did like the idea of nice perky implants!!! im meeting with my surgeon next week to discuss this issue and plan to take all the information in, look at pictures and then make up my mind what is right for me. i think it is important to make your own choice. it is your body after all!   dont let anybody tell you or pressure you into doing anything you dont want to do. just make sure you have done your research and are happy with your descision. sorry i cant be any more use and i hope the surgery goes well for you jess x  ",
