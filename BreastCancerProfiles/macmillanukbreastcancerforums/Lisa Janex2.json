    "Content": "Hello My name is Lisa and I am nearly 38. I was diagnosed with advanced breast cancer just over 9 years ago. I had a mastectomy, high dose chemo (through Hickman line) and approx 25 sessions of radiotherapy. Two years later I had breast reconstruction with complications - I contracted MRSA. A couple of years later I had problems with my heart and needed a mitral valve repair (possibly due to the chemo being cardio-toxic). I then discovered that I am a BRCA2 carrier so opted for a prophylactic mastectomy. A year later I gave birth to my first child (after being told I was probably infertile - due to the chemo). Two days ago I was diagnosed with secondaries in my sternum and rib. At the moment I am not sure what the treatment or prognosis will be but I would love to hear from anyone with any advice, ideas or suggestions. Lisa x",
