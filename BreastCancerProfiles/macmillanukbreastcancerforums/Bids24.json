      "Content": "I was recently diagnosed with a smallish invasive grade 2 breast tumour and my op to remove it was arranged. I expressed concern at a very early stage about my BMI and concern about anaesthetic. Nevertheless, my op was postponed at pre-op stage due to my BMI and I had to wait an extra  10 days for a slot at a hospital where I could be treated more safely.  On the day of my surgery, I met my consultant, who said he would see me soon in theatre. However, I later found out that he had handed the operation over to a colleague without informing me. The surgeon who performed my op is not a consultant, but a less qualified surgeon- admittedly with considerable experience, but not someone I had been able to meet before my op and choose to trust.  I feel relieved to have the lumpectomy behind me, but Imalso feel betrayed by my consultant, who led me to believe that he would perform my operation.  I have also been told to wait three weeks for my pathology report, which seems too long to me and is adding to the stress. Oh, and the doctor I will see is not my original consultant or the surgeon who performed my op.  Is this the norm or am I right to feel very concerned? I have spoken to twobreast care nurses and, while they say the doctors work as a team, they too are surprised that my consultant is not the person who performed my operation and that he did not tell me about the apparent last minute change of surgeon. ",

      "Content": "Thanks, Puzzler. I hope that BC nurse you encountered regrets her abrupt words to you.  The two nurses I have spoken to so far have been extremely supportive and I have been able to tell them how abandoned I have felt where my consultant and the hospital system is concerned. They have been instrumental in finding out for me the name of the surgeon who performed my op (!!!!) and giving me the date of my pathology appointment when the hospital failed to inform me! They are very busy people, but have always called back as promised and done their best to reassure me. I think your nurse may have taken out some of her stress on you that day, which was very unprofessional and probably not the norm.  Wishing you the best for a good recovery. ",

Maybe the team were just aware of the likely delay in my case, so made the appointment three weeks rather than two. I freaked out so much when my op was postponed that they may not have wanted to run the risk of having to postpone my pathology appointment!  It helps to know why the wait might be three weeks rather than two. I have also read that a test might be done that requires sending samples to America. Well, it's a possibility!  The main thing is to receive the best possible treatment, which you seem to have done. I am not convinced at the moment, but I hope that things will proceed more smoothly now. I am learning a lot about how you can think you are coping well until something doesn't go to plan and you find yourself overwhelmed by anxiety and feelings of being just a number in the system.",

      "Content": "I had a 15mm tumour removed with two sentinel nodes, for which the blue dye was used. Like you, one node was positive. As macro cells were involved, I then had an axillary dissection. The dye is not needed for that op. There are three levels of axillary nodes and my surgeon recommended removing all the nodes. I read, however, that the norm in several other countries is to remove two levels, which is what my surgeon agreed to do to in the end. 9 more nodes were removed, in two lumps of fatty tissue, all of which were clear of cancer. Result was 1/11 nodes positive, therefore.  If there is anything you are unsure of you will get helpful advice here, but also ask your breast care nurse or arrange to see your consultant or their team with any questions you have regarding your treatment. I did and they were always ready to give me their time, despite being very busy. ",

I am not normally one to make a great fuss, but the inconsistencies in my treatment so far have had an impact on my anxiety level that I can't shake off at the moment. I have told the breast care nurses and one has promised to talk to the consultant and get back to me tomorrow. I have asked if I might be able, at least, to receive some basic results by phone if I really have to wait three weeks for my pathology report. I have also penned two emails, to PALS and to my consultant, which I will send if I continue to feel so let down by my local NHS system.  It might help me to hear if anyone else has had a similar experience to me, especially if they have been treated by the Wigan, Wrightington, Leigh BC Team. ",

I have been prescribed Letrozole for up to 10 years. The treatment seems to be generally regarded as very effective and goes some way towards easing some of the inevitable anxiety regarding the chances of recurrence. Also be prepared for radiation therapy. It isn't an ordeal and, though there may be some side effects, if it is part of your treatment, it also lessens the chances of recurrence.  You will be able to talk through your treatment plan with your oncologist and will be told a percentage by which chemotherapy, if offered, might protect you against recurrence. Your oncologist will either recommend it or not. If you are borderline for the benefit of chenotherapy outweighing the risk of side effects, your oncologist will very possibly let you choose.  Are you aware of the NHS Predict web page? You can put in details from your pathology report (your tumour size, hormone receptor status etc) and get more idea of the benefits of hormone treatment and/or chemotherapy to you. If you want to see your pathology report, you could ask your oncologist or consultant to send you a copy. ",

Of course we worry every slight twinge, swelling or what feels like a lump is something sinister. Try to take comfort from the reassurance given recently by your oncologist and the knowledge that you will be seen again very soon for a mammogram and then by your surgeon. I would say that, if you feel continuously stressed, it Is well worth contacting your bc nurse to see if you might bring forward those appointments or even just see the nurse for another interim examination. I have a lumpiness around my scar as well as swelling and orange peel skin on the breast and, like anyone would, I worry about it. I've been reassured that the lumpiness is scar tissue and have recently been told the other symptoms are lymphoedema, for which I have now started treatment. My recent first post op mammogram showed \"nothing to cause worry\". What a happy moment that was! However, I do - and always will- still worry. After what we have been through, it is only natural that we will worry and be proactive about seeing a doctor, oncologist or breast care nurse about any changes that cause us concern. ",

      "Content": "Hi, I think a score of 25 puts you in the intermediate zone, but also on the cusp where chemotherapy might  be recommended. Discussion of your results with your oncologist will help you make the best decision. You may be borderline for chemotherapy being beneficial. However, the grade of your cancer, the type of breast cancer, your age, your general health, your ER and PR status and whether or not any nodes were positive will all be taken into consideration by your oncologist, with the Oncotype test as a reputedly very accurate resource. You could also ask for a second opinion, if you think that would help.  Many people with a score just a little higher than yours have had chemo, whereas others haven't. I have read that people who are PR- may be more at risk of a recurrence, so are more likely to have chemotherapy recommended.  My oncologist left the decision to me, as she believed chenotherapy would offer me 3% benefit. Had it been 4% or  5%, she would have recommended chemotherapy. Had it been 1% or 2%, she would have advised against it. I asked for the Oncotype-DX test, but would have had to pay for it. She advised me that she was convinced the result would still be the same and the decision would still be mine. I decided to have hormone treatment and radiotherapy. One year, having developed some lymphoedema, I am still not certain whether forgoing chemotherapy was the wisest choice, but glad that I am not having to worry about any other possibly  long term side effects alongside the lymphoedema. ",

I try, as I'm sure you do, to replace them with thoughts of \"I am just thankful that....\".  Like you, I hadn't felt quite right about my body for a while. My bra size seemed to be going up and I wondered if my right breast seemed slightly bigger than I remembered. However, I read that a larger breast size often happens with menopause. I could feel no lumps, so I let it go.  I moved house, signed up with a new doctor, had a standard check up......all fine. I asked about going for a mammogram, as I thought I might be due for one and  I was given a number to phone to arrange one at my local hospital. The same happened again at another appointment. I never got around to making the call.   A year later, after another standard review and a blood test, my doctor prescribed iron tablets, as slight anaemia was making me feel tired. I mentioned tiredness, but not that my right breast might be increasing slightly in size.  A month after that, I received a letter to go for my standard three yearly mammogram, which revealed an invasive 15mm breast tumour. Following WLE and axillary node dissection (one node positive), I often wish I had made that phone call and maybe found the tumour earlier, before it had a chance to become invasive. However, I am so thankful that I went for the standard mammogram when the letter arrived. At least I did something right! The tumour was quite deep and not big enough to be felt, so if it had been left longer, the situation would have been even more serious. My oncologist even said that, had I gone for the mammogram the previous year, the tumour might not have been there or been detected at that stage.  After this experience, I think we have learned the hard way to be more in tune with our instinct where our bodies are concerned and to be more assertive and less embarrassed when dealing with doctors. We are also so aware of and grateful for the wonderful work done by the medical profession. ",

A claimant being treated for cancer or recovering from treatment should automatically be placed in that group. The person you spoke to could have been more sympathetic and at least said, \"You MAY feel better by then\" and explained WHY a new review will be needed. If you phone again, you might get a more professional response.  I received ESA in 2011, some years before being diagnosed with breast cancer. You could only be on National Insurance Contribution based ESA for a maximum of one year. After that it was means tested. I think it still works that way for now, though it is being replaced.  I had advanced arthritis in my knees and, even after a double knee replacement, needed sticks to walk. I never made it into the support group, but was placed in the WRAG group (where it is assumed you will become fit for work again). I think I was called in for at least one review. It was very stressful at a time when that was the last thing I needed, but I got through it and the benefit relieved a lot of my stress regarding finances until I was awarded early retirement.  If you are no better after six months, I imagine you will be able to go through the process again, with similar supporting letters from your consultant etc. and remain in the support group. ",

You can ask for a referral to a lymphoedema clinic - maybe ask your BC nurse first, as it might be quicker to get diagnosis and treatment, if you need it. A doctor is likely to recommend a steroid cream, which may clear the redness and stop the itching, if it's not lymphoedema. Perhaps press for a referral to be sure, though. If you do get a lymphoedema diagnosis, it's not serious and treatments such as self massage, kinesio taping or even laser treatment can improve things. Hope that helps you.",

I think I was developing the problem after the lumpectomy anyway and that RT treatment as well as the axillary op then added to the problem.

The narrow margin does bother me still, but .i did develop breast lymphoedema and, had I had a boost, perhaps that would have been worse than it is. No way of knowing. Your tumour seems to be about a third the size that mine was and sane grade, so perhaps that explains why the oncologist is satisfied with just .5mm of margin? When  you ask, I'm sure they'll explain .  I did read quite a lot online at had tine and can remember seeing research that suggested a narrow margin could be fine and not require a second op.

If you take them for a short while, you may well find that they really help. If they don't help, make sure to let your doctor know. In your shoes, feeling as down and exhausted as you do, i think I would consider phoning Macmillan to enquire about counselling or contacting my breast care nurse or doctor's surgery to look into local counselling services or support groups.   I agree about experiencing something very much like ptsd  symptoms after cancer diagnosis and treatment. Despite wanting to move on, you may replay in your head the moment of diagnosis, the discussions about your disease, your care plan and the actual treatment. These thoughts, perhaps with a broken sleep routine or effects from your medication, can also add to your fatigue and increase your concern that you don't feel like yourself anymore.  I wonder what sort of treatment you had and are having now and how it may affect you physically I wonder if the people around you treat you differently now or perhaps need to see you behaving \"normally\" because they so much want you to be better again. Perhaps talking it out with them and telling them how you really feel will help? Every now and again, when someone in my family asks how I am, I say I'm fine, but also let them know about my fear it will come back. They look uncomfortable, but I feel so much better for telling them how I REALLY feel! ",

I have had family members try to reassure me that it wasn't as bad as it could have been and I can put it behind me now and move on. I always agree that yes, I feel lucky not to have experienced the added stress of chemotherapy or even a mastectomy. However,  I also make it clear that my life is different now, as I will always be afraid that breast cancer will return or there may be secondaries at some point in the future.  People who say it could have been worse or it wasn't so bad are mostly wanting to reassure you or themselves that you are okay and the trauma is over. Unless they have been through something similar, most can't understand the life changing impact of any cancer diagnosis.  When someone makes a  comment that upsets you, perhaps let them know, calmly, that it's not helpful. Try to explain why.  At least then they will be mindful about repeating that sort of comment to anyone else.",

I recall telling him he looked well and then instantly regretting it. Truth was, he looked thinner and tired, but I wanted him -and probably myself - to feel positive about his illness.   I would only use that sentence now if it's absolutely true. People have used it with me recently, but I take no offence, because throughout my treatment, except when I had to carry around a drain for a while (and was able to hide away at home for 12 days), I actually did look well, as far as appearing in public was concerned.  A lot people being treated for cancer know if they look unwell and to imply otherwise is not helpful, even if the intention is good. ",

If they really expect you to wait that long, you have every right to complain.  According to The Macmillan booklet I have:  \"In England and Wales, GPs follow the guidance from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). Anyone suspected of having breast cancer should be seen within two weeks of being referred (or within 10 working days if you live in Wales) \". \"The maximum waiting time for non-urgent consultant-led treatments is 18 weeks from the day your appointment is booked through the NHS e-Referral Service, or when the hospital or service receives your referral letter.\" In your place, I would be returning to my GP to check the referral was correctly marked urgent. The hospital's PALS service might also be able to get that waiting time changed for you.  Waiting for a diagnosis is incredibly stressful and, if your doctor believes you may have breast cancer, you have every right to be seen within a reasonable amount of time. ",

      "Content": "I agree that everyone will have their own way of managing this issue. I was treated last year and, as I did not have chemotherapy, there were no visible signs of my breast cancer treatment, apart from being attached to a drain at one point for about 12 days.  I had moved to a new town and was seeing friends less frequently and I chose to tell family only.  I decided I'd tell friends when the time felt right, but a year later, it hasn't happened yet. If I ever do tell, I hope they won't be too cross that they didn't have a chance to offer their support!  I think my decision was influenced by the fact that a younger ex colleague had recently been diagnosed with secondary breast cancer. My friends were very concerned about her and I think I didn't want to cause them more upset if I could avoid it. I also didn't want my illness to be a focus of our conversations when we did meet up.  One friend, who is a year younger than me, was diagnosed with early stage womb cancer just before my own breast cancer diagnosis. She told family and close friends, including myself and welcomed their support through her treatment. I still decided to tell her nothing about myself, preferring to keep things as normal as possible. That was hard, as I wanted to share my feelings as we went through the same sort of experience, but I knew she would tell other friends and acquaintances and I didn't want that. I think I am just a private person and have strong feelings about not being described by others as \"battling cancer\". I have, in the past, uttered the words, \"You look well\" to someone who looked far from well and to another person who eventually died from their illness. I have heard the same words myself a few times from family during the past year of treatment and bristled because, although I look fine, my health is still a worry. Better to keep my health issues to myself and have normal conversations with friends, when I see them, because that's the sort of person I am.  I have a scenario in my head where a friend is unfortunate enough in the future to be diagnosed with breast cancer and I am able to tell her or him I had it once myself and offer my support. ",

Happily, only 1 of 10 nodes positive (I took a lot of persuading, but decided in the end to take the consultant's advice, though only to level 2). Now waiting to see what treatment comes next.  In the past few days I have developed nerve pain down the back of my arm from armpit to elbow. It seems to hit when I straighten my arm downwards or bend my elbow. It is alleviated by raising my arm or placing it at a right angle across my body for a while. Looks odd when walking around in public! BC nurse says it should pass with time, but I am all for asking my doctor for a referral to a suitable therapist.  Ibuprofen and gritting my teeth to get on with it is not helping much so far. Today I have struggled to do some of the basic arm excercises, especially when lowering my arm to a right angle against a wall. Raising my arm is not a problem.  If anyone has an effective way to handle this symptom, your advice would be much appreciated.",

If you are in and out of hospital in a day, it can really add to the feeling that this really can't be happening to you!  By now you probably have been assigned a breast care nurse.. You could always phone her, or even your consultant, if you want to be clear whether you are  ER+ or ER-. They are usually happy to explain things again. I think, if you were definitely told the treatment is likely to be hormone tablets, then you would be ER+ and probably also HER2-. Perhaps you got them mixed up? If you were HER2+ you would have been told about chenotherapy.  At my first appointment with a consultant and breast care nurse, I was given a booklet in which the nurse ticked off what they knew so far about my breast cancer and the likely treatment. That really helped me understand what was happening to me. There was also a list of recommended websites. You might be someone who prefers not to research too much, but take things as they come. If so, I admire you! I was one of those who was inclined to research so much there was little that a consultant could tell me in the end that I hadn't already worked out! ",

I certainly do!  All I can say is that even before I was diagnosed back in April I had noticed ridges appearing on my fingernails and had noticed them becoming more brittle. After reading up online, I put it down to my age (58 or so when it started a couple of years ago). Not so sure, though, about the nail coming away from the nail bed.  For peace of mind, I think it would help to check with your GP, breast care nurse or oncologist. They could probably give you clear advice or even prescribe something to help strengthen your nails. Take care of yourself. x",

      "Content": "I would say keep questioning your consultant and breast care team until you absolutely accept the plan for this new operation.  Four months ago I faced a similar situation: a small tumour found through screening, one positive node (macro cells) requiring a second op to remove and check further nodes. Through reading online, I realised it was standard procedure in several other countries to perform axillary dissection (2 levels of nodes) rather than full axillary clearance (3 levels) because it seems to cause less arm and shoulder morbidity. I believed that, being obese, I was particularly at risk of developing mobility issues or  lymphoedema after the op.  After seeing my consultant and his colleague again twice, I requested level 2 axillary axillary dissection. There is a risk that, even though the removed nodes were all clear, the remaining level 3 nodes could be affected, but that is something you either accept or not. After the op, I had nerve pain in my right elbow, but it virtually disappeared as I healed and with the help of tablets from my doctor. I still have some swelling in my breast and armpit but it does not affect my arm movement. I am careful to avoid heavy lifting and carrying, as that does seem to trigger some elbow pain, as can using a walking stick. Those are not issues everyone would experience after the op and they are not severe enough to interfere with quality of life.  Having the axillary dissection gave reassurance that no further nodes closest to the tumour were affected. If I hadn't had the op, I would be worrying about that still. I am as satisfied as I can be that the decision was right for me. Making your decision is the most stressful part of the whole thing, but you will reach a stage where you accept whatever action feels right for you.",

      "Content": "Hi Jackie, just over a year ago I had a lumpectomy and partial axillary dissection. I'd read online that it is standard to remove axillary nodes at levels 1 and 2 and not take nodes at level 3.  I had one affected sentinel node out of two (macromets) and the consultants I spoke to strongly believed no more nodes would be positive, but recommended the axillary op to make sure. They agreed that removing nodes to level two only would lessen the risk of shoulder mobility problems and, possibly, lymphoedema. They would have preferred a full dissection, but agreed to do what I decided.  In the end, there were no more affected nodes and I was glad that I hadn't had them all removed. I did have nerve pain from armpit to elbow for a few weeks, but it gradually cleared up. I developed lymphoedema in my breast, which is sometimes uncomfortable, but my arm is unaffected. Perhaps if I'd had full dissection, the lymphoedema might have affected my arm too.  It's stressful deciding what to do for the best. You can leave it entirely up to your consultant or you can research, as you are doing now, weigh things up, and make a choice you feel entirely content with. ",
