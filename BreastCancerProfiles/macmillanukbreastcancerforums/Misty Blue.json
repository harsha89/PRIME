      "Content": "Hi Everyone, I've initially introduced myself to the main online community here, and I'm now uncertain whether you can access what I wrote and my queries, including the reasons I feel so left and abandoned. I've been living with breast cancer for two years now. Initially I attended the Hospital Cancer Unit where various scans, etc confirmed the growth was already large and spread to my lymph glands. We discussed my options, and agreed to a small pill (can't remember the name) over a period of three months, which made me violently sick and ill. I'm on a cocktail of medication for a range of disabilities, without which I can't move, and this triggered my hemiplegic migraines which result in mini strokes and an implosion of pain pulsing constantly in my head day and night for which they've never found a pill to relieve. Cancer symptoms and pain mesh with my disabilities. There seems no way they can be separated out. After a lot of discussion, during which I was assured repeatedly that one-to-one support would remain, I decided I'd enough going on and asked the consequences of stopping treatment and operations might be. I'd still not seen a doctor or Specialist other than my own GP. But it was explained that stopping treatment meant support would remain, and they would continue to check the progress of the disease which would then take its course. And Morphine would be added for the pain. I'm not afraid of death. But yes, there's still the journey, however long it takes, to that end point. That's the part which is scary. I also believe in the Quality rather than the Quantity of Life! My decision to stop treatment came with the assurance that someone would guide me through, support, listen and share concerns, explain what was happening to my body, and keep a check on the Cancer. I should also add that, because I was sexually abused as a child from the age of four by a Hospital Specialist I attended three times a week for ten years for my disabilities, I have PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress). Abuse on all levels has been a major part of my life, and I explained as best I could to the Cancer team. It affects every aspect of Life. But especially when it comes to illness, and particularly hospitals. To begin treatment would mean I would be permanently in the thick of PTSD without relief. I revert to being Child, with everything bigger than, so that much scarier. I live with shadows of the past consuming me. Everything becomes a trigger ... and so much more ... Does that make sense, especially when you know after my first visit at the Cancer Unit I wandered corridors of the hospital, lost in the past, no-one picking up on that despite my attempts to explain I'd need support to get back to Reception? I was 'lost' two hours and more. I have no recollection where I went, what I did, who I spoke to or saw. All I know is I was back in the past, like a nightmare. My final visit at the hospital was like being dismissed. All of five minutes it took. I was left the other side of the door ... again wandering, tears streaming down my face because I'd kept saying 'what have I done wrong?' 'where is the support you promised?' She'd already admitted the next patient while I was still in the room, and I just felt so abandoned ... betrayed. Since then, nothing. Nobody. I'd phoned my GP who said I was now under the local hospice. That was that! Then after a few weeks, someone phoned from the hospice to say I'd 'fallen down the cracks'. She visited next day. Offered eight weekly sessions at their Day Centre. The last was just before Christmas. I felt so comforted, so reassured so ... I didn't see a doctor, but at least I could ask about finance and support, etc. But then, despite all assurances, I've heard and seen no-one since. A letter of discharge arrived from the hospital. My GP will see me for other disabilities, but not Cancer, although the Hospice did get her to put me on Morphine which has proved a huge relief. All I'm asking is someone to visit once a week, or fortnight or month ... or are they waiting until I become an emergency? Meanwhile, I've gone one step further with PTSD and become an Agoraphobic. I hunker down in my burrow afraid. I'm sorry this has gone on. I'm an author, if you hadn't guessed. Everything I write seems to roll out of me like a carpet of words. I can now see the outline of the growth on the outside of my left breast, with dagger-like pain. I'm guessing it might break through and I'll need it dressing by a District Nurse. I dread becoming an emergency ... phasing out of the present, back into the past. Well, that's me. But please don't think I'm a winger. I'm a survivor. I can be strong for other people. As a Counsellor, I would help and support anyone feeling just as I do now, and fight the System. Today is a Red Letter Day because, after writing on this Forum yesterday, I stepped out into the sunshine this morning and, despite the pain, reached the village and back, which I haven't done in a fair while. I've also started my 30th book. So all in all, time to Celebrate? Does anyone else have anything to celebrate? Me ... I'm a Chocoholic!! I don't drink, don't smoke. Never have done either. But I just loooooooove my choccie! Thanks for listening, for caring. I believe in the power of positive self-help and sharing. Hugs, Misty xx",

      "Content": "Hi Moomy, Sorry it was such a long post, but a heartfelt THANKS for coming back to me. Thanks also for understanding about how big a deal it's been today to actually get out in the real world. I live in the 1940s with the book I'm currently writing, so it comes as a bit of a shocker to realise the world has moved on!! To be honest, I haven't been 'picked up by the Hospice Team' in any meaningful way. I had those eight times at their Day Centre, but that's been it. No-one has been in touch. I've left several messages for them to come back to me to ask about home visits and support. No response. I've even called their Emergency number where they say there's someone to talk outside surgery hours. The phone just kept on ringing, and I tried a couple of times. I guess you can understand why I feel somehow punished? Thanks for suggesting the group on this site for incurable Cancer, and the nurses number. I guess I just want to know what happens next ... and because Cancer reacts differently on people, what to expect and do, rather than end up an emergency. I was hoping face-to-face they could actually take a look-see, let me share their thoughts, know what's happening? There's so much love and support, kindness and concern on this site as a whole I feel overwhelmed at times. Last night I just let all the emotion flow through, and went to bed still crying, but at least knowing that there are people out there who really do care. Big hugs back xx",

      "Content": "Hello Moomy, You'd never believe how much we have in common! For over twenty years I have supported veterans and their families of RAF 100 Group, in which my Mum's wartime fiance served in the lead Squadron, 192, which linked directly with Bletchley Park. After each operation, these guys would meet up with someone from Bletchley, handing over information. Sadly, a few days before their wedding, Mum's fiance and his Canadian pilot failed to return from a covert operation. Nothing was heard from them again. I still have the hundreds of wartime letters they shared, his inner silk flying gloves, and three precious photos which was all she had to remember him. He has no known grave. What happened to their Mosquito DK292 remains a secret, a mystery to this day. Having spent my life writing, I have decided it fitting to revisit the book Mum and I brought together, in which I first feature the little known RAF 100 Group. The book was published to mark the 60th Anniversary of their death. Sadly, Mum died of Cancer before seeing this work published. But from information and research, and the material I receive each day from around the world, I'm updating this book and re-publishing it to ensure they are never forgotten. This will be my 30th book, so a mile-stone. I've written a great deal about RAF 100 Group, passionate about preserving their history and stories. Most of their experiences are written by them and included in my books, a legacy which can be handed down through their families. This is my worldwide Family of Kindred Spirits, with whom I share such a binding connection. We're involved in one another's everyday lives, and I arrange a Reunion in Norfolk each year in May to which they come from all over. It's such an emotive weekend, but one I won't be able to attend this year. I couldn't take the train journey, or the stress, but I'm sorry to miss seeing them all, and listening and 'dancing' to the special 1940's Singers arranged for the occasion of the Saturday evening main Dinner. Anyway, that's me. Thanks for writing, and I hope we can keep in touch. Hugs back xx",

      "Content": "Seaspirit44, what you have written sounds absolutely wonderful, and so much the way I expected it to be ...  'The hospice should be seeing you regularly. The GP is obliged to,flag you on the system as an incurable cancer patient , and you should have regular reviews and priority if you need more urgent care. They are supposed to,have meetings with nurses etc where they discuss patients like you and your ongoing care.' I wish!! And no, I don't have anyone who could be an Advocate for me, apart from someone I was put onto by a lady who comes to clean for me and is coming this afternoon to fill in forms relating to finance. I asked if he would be my Advocate in this field as it's what he does for a living, and he's telephoned for at least one form for monies I'm entitled to. It just takes time ... with lots of waiting inbetween. They've suddenly written me a letter saying they're stopping my DLA (Disability Living Allowance), and he has applied for this new PIP (Personal Independent Payment) so it's like starting all over again. I can't fill in forms myself because of chronic arthritis in my hands ... but at least I can speed type ... something I taught myself quite a few years ago now during a year's period of Agoraphobia. So again, something Positive came out of a mass Negative. Where I live, the hospital and Dr seems completely separate. They don't seem to communicate with one another, certainly not having meetings. Yet that seems the right way to go. Thanks for thinking about me. Your support and encouragement is invaluable. Love and hugs xx",

      "Content": "Hello Seaspirit44, Just wanted to offer a heartfelt THANK YOU xx for your openness, honesty and caring writings ... and to everyone who has made me feel valued. My situation hasn't changed, and no I don't have an Advocate, or friend, or anyone who can share this burden with me and help me through the maze leading mainly to cul-de-sacs where nothing happens, once again left out in the cold; but everyone here on this Site has given me a reason to challenge the System and not simply accept what I am given ... or not given, I should say! I was becoming paranoid, believing this is only happening to me, that I must have done something terribly wrong. Now all these voices tell otherwise ... and I believe, suddenly, in human kindness again, as you give me the strength to go on. This morning's Positive is that I've put in a phone call to my GP to phone as a matter of urgency. As the 0808 808 0000 Main Macmillan Support Line urged when I phoned over the weekend, I need to tell her I have no support. She may think I'm receiving support from the Hospice, but this isn't the case, and she has to know. That done, I've also someone coming tomorrow evening around 5 pm to fill out forms regarding finance. Seems I'm missing out on so much, and he's going to try to get it back-dated. I don't know where these new avenues will take me, but I'm still here and pushing for all its worth! There's an old Greek myth which paints a picture of Hell as being someone pushing a huge boulder up a steep hill. Each time he gets close to the summit, the boulder slips and rolls all the way back down where he starts the process again ... over and over again. That's how I feel right now. I'd also like to say that, through reading your profiles, you are each of you A.M.A.Z.I.N.G.  Thank you ALL for your care, support, and Love xx",

      "Content": "Hi Maria, I'm so sorry to have triggered unwanted flashbacks from your own past through sharing my own. I do so hope you have coping strategies or a better support network than me. Yet at the same time, I have to say that in sharing what you did, it means you understand. It's impossible to explain to people who don't know, who haven't been there. I get frustrated trying to find words for emotions which just aren't there. You know what I mean? It's the reason I became an artist as well as a writer, initially using colour, trying to mirror what I feel inside, eventually opening out to paint with acrylics the world around me as I moved to a part of the UK I'd never lived before, and for which therefore for me had no past memories. But then we carry them regardless! However, I find it tremendously enriching and rewarding as well as challenging, bringing out what is screwing me up inside. I live by two truths: 'To deny one's experience is to deny one's Self', and 'Forgiving is not forgetting ... it's remembering, and letting go.' Forgive me for bringing up this topic. I just want you to know that someone out here understands and cares because she knows the experience as her own. The happenings can be different. But the residue of emotion can be the same. You are valued! xx",

      "Content": "Hi Shieldscannylass, Oh yey! I believe in Time Travel through writings ... how can I not? I live in the 1940's era, and I love the fact that life was so much simpler, people so much more together, surrounded by families and friends, popping in next door to borrow a cup of sugar ... I love it!! I started with short stories, then articles, but to be honest, I'm a book writer as you've probably gathered from my posts here. It all comes blathering out. I think there's a stage lower than loneliness, which means whatever you want to call it ... personally, I refer to it as 'The Blue Funk' ... it means it's not just being alone, feeling isolated, fearful of the dark, etc, etc, etc, but more than anything it's the intimacy I crave. Someone to share life, the downs as well as the ups. Just to hold a hand. Have a hug. Being comfortable with the silence. Sharing conversation or a film. I've had so little of it in my life, I guess I miss that more than anything. When I was a little girl, yes, my mother particularly. Playing games meant creating a wigwam out of wood, making a bow and arrow, climbing into my own imagination, sailing the seven seas in a pirate boat made from a cardboard box. The book I'm re-working is written already and published. It's just that the publishers did the dirty on me. And I have another who's waiting in the wings to get it back out under a different cover on the bookshelves and Amazon. But this time it'll have a second part to it about the different theories of what happened to the Mosquito my mother's fiance was flying in, and the words of his best friend with whom I share a close connection today. Phil is 98 years old. Vic will always be 22. I do wish you all the best in your own writing. If I didn't have that as a distraction from the Cancer I'd go mad!! Hugs xx",
