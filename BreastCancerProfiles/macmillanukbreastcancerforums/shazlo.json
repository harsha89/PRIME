    "Content": "Thank you for posting this on my behalf. After consultation with my doctor it was decided I was unsuitable for the trial because the HRT I've been on would take 4 weeks to flush out of my system and he wanted me to have Letrozole straight away rather than wait 4 weeks. Only two days in with Letrozole and feeling tired and a bit headachy but don't know whether it is coming off HRT too. Will have to see how it goes.Â ",
