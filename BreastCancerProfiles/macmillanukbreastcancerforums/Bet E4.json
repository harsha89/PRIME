      "Content": "frankie45 Hi BetE4, not sure if you have or haven't had reconstruction. I had a mastectomy nearly 18 months ago,  no reconstruction and am very nearly decided to have other breast removed, my surgeon has agreed to this but has given me longer to think it over. Not sure if this is the sort of thing you are interested to hear about xx Hi Frankie, thanks for reply.  I am still trying to find my way round the Macmillan site. I am happy to hear from anyone who has been through this surgery.  Still pretty bruised and battered but getting there. I would like to see if many women have decided not to have reconstruction. I am happy I didn't have it. Had enough surgery to last me a lifetime!  Just re-organising my wardrobe. A good excuse to go shopping. Nothing looks the same now I am flat chested. But I still dont regret it.  How you doing?",
