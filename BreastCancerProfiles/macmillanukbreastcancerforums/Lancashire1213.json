      "Content": "Hey Londonlass xxx just catching up on your post...... I'm so sorry you've been feeling so low and in pain. Some doctors are just too de sensitised (can't spell) but when it comes to any serious illness they need to sort themselves out!!! Bloody hell!!!! Many years ago (when cancer was never in the picture) it was only when I cried that my GP took me seriously!! It's just not on!  Anyway SORRY I just think you are such a lovely lady that (as many others have said) is so kind to everyone and I'm feeling mad with the way you were treated. Anyway I'm glad the last person took you seriously and you have some new medication now. Really hope it helps xxxxxxx thinking of you xxx",

I'm glad now that I got my rash as it meant that I was extra careful with how I showered and applied products. Then I found the lump! Devastating but had the rash not been there, I might not have found the lump until weeks later.  I'm starting my chemo this Friday and I feel shattered today. Must be the anxiety of it all xxx",
