I had a brain tumour some years ago which left me with epilepsy and am worried that the chemo may increase the severity of my seizures. Does anyone have any experience of this?",

I did not want a mastectomy and the surgeon reassured me that as long as he got clear margins which thank fully he did if I had radiotherapy the rate of recurrence and survival is as good as a mastectomy. It is a very personal thing but a hard choice. Dawn",
