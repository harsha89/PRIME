    "Content": "I feel as though I am in a terrifying nightmare and can't wake up. I had a swollen gland under my arm last November. A mammogram spotted a cluster of microcalcifications in my breast, I had a biopsy which said I had high grade DCIS Â measuring 12mm. A lumpectomy then showed the area to be 45mm plus a 9mm grade 2 tumour. I had a second lumpectomy 2 weeks ago with SND which found yet more DCIS plus another small grade 2 tumour. Out of 6 nodes removed one had cancer cells. I am having a MX and ANC on Tuesday. My dilemma is that I really want a double MX. None of this cancer showed up on mammogram other than 5 dots of the microcalcifications. My family are continually telling me I should just have both removed although my consultant says that he will remove the other breast but not until I am healed and finished any treatment. I am so terrified that there are the same areas of cancer in my other breast that haven't been detected. I also had a CT last week that showed an enlarged node on the surgery side but my organs were clear. Can anyone relate to my fears and maybe give some calm to the turmoil I am feeling. Should I have sought a second opinion as everyone is telling me? I know they only want the best for me but I am really frightened now.",
