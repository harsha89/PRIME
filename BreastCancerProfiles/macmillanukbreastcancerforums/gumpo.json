      "Content": "Hi windmill,  I am in Same position as you. Went to doctor with a dull ache in my left Brest which I've had for about 6 months. No obvious changes or lumps that I could feel. She done an examination & found nothing in my left breast but when examining my right breast she felt a thickening under my nipple. I was shocked as I hadn't noticed anything although that breast does gets itchy sometimes. Anyway, she has fast tracked me to breast clinic and I've an appointment on fri 2nd June. I'm worried sick and of course Dr Google is playing with my emotions! Never heard of thicking so don't even know what I should be feeling in my breast. Friday can't come quick enough!! Hope time passes quick for us and we gets reassurance and good news xx",
