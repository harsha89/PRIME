    "Content": "I've just had third of my 18 dose course of herceptin. First one really hurt but no side effects apart from the ones I already had from chemo/radio. I already had arthritis which has got much worse. Had Athsma which has got worse. Breathlessness an issue and GP not much help. Had my my third injection at home yesterday which didn't hurt thanks to lovely nurse. However, later I feel like I have dead leg, can't put much weight on it due to pain in muscle. No visible swelling or redness but the pain bad.Â ",
