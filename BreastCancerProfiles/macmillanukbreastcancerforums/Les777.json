    "Content": "Hi, I have recently had 6 chemo sessions for prostate and suffered from a tongue like crazy paving, plus sore mouth. They tell me chemo kills most of the 20,000 saliva cells we have causing dryness and infection. I think a lot of the ladies in the unit were on the same thing as me - Docataxel - so dare say similar side effects.  I was assigned a new oncologist, a Romanian chap, he told me to dump the Corsadyl and the hospital prescribed Difflam, and use salt water, yes I was also surprised, but it worked a treat. 1 Litre of water, stir in 1 teaspoon of salt, gargle it and use 2 or 3 times a day. I tried 1 tsp in half litre, tasted more salty but worked better as mouth got worse farther into the chemo. The Difflam did work far better than Corodsyl, but nowhere as good as the salt water. I also strted using brown sauce, pepper and spices more as the taste buds failed. Now 8 weeks since my chemo ended, and all is fine apart from my nails are not quite back to normal Not sure where you are, but I found Difflam to be a sort of hidden secret in Sheffield, the hospital don't tell you its there for free on prescription, seems to be word of mouth from other patients. Hope this may be of help to you at what is a very awful time Best wishes to you and your loved ones. Les and Julie Howard - Sheffield If anyone wants, or needs to speak about any prostate related problems. please feel free to get in touch. I was in a lonely place when I started out on this journey some 6 years ago.,,,,,,,,, So only too pleased to assist if I can.",
