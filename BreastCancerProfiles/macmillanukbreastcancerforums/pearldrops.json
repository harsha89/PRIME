      "Content": "Well done for not ignoring your symptoms scary though it is. If only we had the ability to know ourselves if we have cancer or not. We have to leave it to mammograms and biopsy.   The biopsy I didn't find to bad a friend had explained what had happened to her so I knew what to expect. It was really like a big pen that clunked when pressed and I felt no pain just a bit sore the next day. What I didn't expect was the waiting for the results all though I think being told I would have to ask my surgeon about going on holiday 2 months later kind of gave the game away!! Anyway here I am after lumpectomy and radiotherapy almost 2 years later and feeling great. Breast cancer is very treatable and if this is your case know that your team will act quickly and do their very best to give you a good outcome. For all we know it's a cyst and nothing to worry about but of course that won't stop the niggles of fear. So hang on in there remember the positives it could be nothing and if it's something it can be treatable. For now be kind to yourself and try distracting tactics anything to keep your mind off it. There are lots of us on this site who have been where you are we all try and support one another. So wishing you the best positive outcome. Que serra questions serra  Hugs Pearl",

      "Content": "Hello just little me you may have all ready had lots of replies but would just like to ado things I found helpful.  I had my lumpectomy and WLE in April last year 13 lymph nodes removed with one cancerous . I didn't have a seed put in but a wire was put in on the day of operation to guide the surgeon. Sounds horrific but honestly never felt a thing and could even laugh As with the dressing on I looked like madona with the big pointy booby!  Recovery is different for all of us but heavy lifting should be avoided as you'll have stitches inside and out. Listen to what advice your surgeon and nurse give you. You will have a drain in place from the wound again no problem it's like a light tube going into a bottle this is usually  removed before going home. I used to put my bottle in the next sink to wash my hands:-)). If possible take a lightly padded cushion with you ,a heart shape one is ideal, as this helps with the seat belt for travelling home. Also found it great for keeping the underarm away from my body. It's very important that you go home having been given arm excercises this is to prepare you for radiotherapy as you need to be able to raise both arms above your head. If for some reason your not given these instructions or told about them do ask your nurse. I was put on the bum (bowel ) ward after my op and was given no excercises to follow fortunately I knew I needed them so my bcn sent them out to me. Yes it's sore but nothing you can't handle and it does heal and you move on very quickly then your onto the next stage.  Take it a step at a time and each step takes you nearer to being a neddy ( no evidence of disease )  Good luck I'll be thinking of you. Your stronger than you know. HUGS PEARL ",

Lymph nodes are in various places around the body so yea I still have some left. I try to be careful with that arm and apart from a slight numbness underneath the arm feel fine. I was borderline  for chemo and oncologist said the 3% extra security wasn't worth putting me through it. At the time I agreed with her however since then doubts have crept in as to whether I've done the right thing but convince myself shes the oncologist and must know her onions sort of speak. For me the clearance was a no brainer just get rid it had done it's job moping up chuck it out. After what you have been through its another mountain to climb and face but your strong and able to get through it . Everyone wants the best possible outcome and your team is working to give you a fighting chance to kick cancer butt. Prepare a heart pillow for after surgery it's good for resting under the arm and undER the seat belt and to cuddle at anytime. Use this site we are routing for you best wishes hang in there.xx",

Scary because I felt I had no protection from the cancer returning I contacted my oncologist to check I was doing the right thing and to inform her of my reaction. I have since seen her and been put on exemestane which all though have side effects I cross fingers don't have an allergic reaction to. Using this site I have learnt that different brands of the same tablet suit various people eg exemestane accord brand seems to suit me better and I have just asked my pharmacist if he can get that one in for me. I don't know if it's the same for letrozole but ask your oncologist or bc nurse for advice  hopefully they can help. All of the tablets have side effects it's finding the one that you can cope with.

Like you I went to my GP who advised I go back to breast clinic. Which I did consultant checked me out thought there was no reason to worry but to put my mind at rest booked an ultrasound which yea proved him right no reason to worry. The point I'd like to make is they were happy to see me and didn't consider it a waste of their time they actually said they would  prefer to see me than have me worry. So get in touch with your breast nurse they may fit you in quicker than via docters. I'm hoping all is OK for you I'm sure a lot of it is after effects of treatment. It's the unknown that destroys our strength with knowledge we can cope and be stronger. Best of luck.",

Talking to oncologist  as I was borderline for chemo treatment I honestly  didn't know which way to go! Told her it was a  decision I found hard to make and would like to be guided by her.  So no chemo but 15 sessions of rads and letrozole and I have to trust we made right decision. I was well and truly zapped and the precision the radiologist take in making sure you are in the right position is very reassuring. We all have doubts and dark thoughts that we haven't got rid of the beast but have to try and put that behind us I  have friends who have gone through the same and they are still here 20 years later. There are no garantees in life so I try to enjoy and take each day as it comes because I'm  still here and standing. I  have a breast that's a different colour tattoos that look like black heads and it's dinted but I'm here to tell the tale. Be positive enjoy life and trust all will be well.

Went to docs twice he couldn't feel anything and as I had a mammogram appointment in 2 months time just kept trying different bras. Spent a small fortune! ! Anyway at mammogram  told breast pain is not associated with breast cancer. Hey ho a recall and yes I had certainly caught cancer . However as it was caught early completely treatable. That was in April 2015 and after a lumpectomy, node clearance, radiation and exemestane tabs I'm still here.  The pain could have been coincidence but I ignore nothing now and if I'm at all concerned I go and get checked out.

She was very sick after the first round of chemo and could keep nothing down. She ended up back in hospital where they managed to get everything under control. Her oncologist tweaked her medication and we had no more episodes like that one. The first few days she slept a lot and lived on ice cream and jelly babies but then she didn't lose her appetite and was soon eating normally again. She had a routine of wiping down all surfaces that were touched by hand with anti bacterial wipes/ kitchen roll soaked in anti bac spray. She did this every day and if she couldn't one of the family did it for her. Her husband has alkziemers so anti bac hand wash was used by both of them. A friend had also told her of a mouth wash called smile which again she used every day. Whether she was lucky or because she was so diligent she never picked up an infection and she didn't suffer with mouth ulcers. Her fear was that because her immune system was compromised she could catch an infection and be very poorly and her concern was for her husband she couldn't bear the thought of him going into care over night. Hope this helps and it seems daunting at first but one day at a time soon becomes the end of a journey.

Got to laugh as I was last down I came to on the bum ( bowel ) ward no offence meant. Because of this I feel I was discharged with no discussion relating to any excercises.  Due to this wonderful Web site I knew excercises were important so found some on cancer uk and contacted BCN to send out information. I understood I could do no damage so gradually built up the range of movement. So pleased I did as you need to raise your arm above your head for radiotherapy as they zapped the boob and underarm. It's doable but if your not sure talk to your BCN. Be kind to yourself and slowly build up the movement.  You may find a cushion under your arm will help with pain relief and is invaluable under a seat belt. I found the underarm area the most tender. The short sharp pangs are nerves healing know it will get better and any concerns you have you you can voice here. In answer to how often I did the excercises  if memory serves me right I believe I did them three times a day but would also raise my arm only several times during the day when watching TV.  Got fed up with hubby asking if I needed the loo!!!! Anyway hope this helps be kind to yourself  and listen to your body. Best wishes for a fast recovery.  ",

      "Content": "Papa smurf it's early days yet. I had my lumpectomy  and nodes in April 2015 and can still get pain. This is the nerves settling down . We are all different and have different pain barriers but if you are at all concerned  talk to your breast care nurse. I had four seromas drained as fluid gathered under my armpit again doable and eventually the fluid moved on and was no longer a problem. I do know when I've done to to much as I can still feel sore under my arm like a paper cut ouch! I've also found that by nightfall my boob has swollen and taken on a square shape as though I have a Mars bar in there!! I do communicate with one of the girls who went through the same op at the same time as me and yes we compare notes and have found we are experiencing the same. A cushion under the arm really helps in the early days. Please know it will improve And be less painful with time. Best wishes for a speedy recovery..xx",

      "Content": "Hi so very scared you need to see someone who you feel can give you the confidence to accept there diagnosis. Have you seen a dermatologist?  I ask because because I became aware of a small red spot that would not go away. I had breast cancer 2015 and lumpectomy  radiation couldn't handle this spot at the same time!! So when treatment finished off to GP Refered to dermatology where they did a small biopsy and it turned out to be Bowens disease not cancerous but if left it could turn nasty. The critter came back so off to clinic been zapped twice so now it's gone. Yea so now I'm a pale and interesting English woman when I go on holiday factor 30or 40 sun cream it's doing the wrinkles a world of good. Please for your own peace of mind see someone who you feel can help and then get on with enjoying life. A day of worry is a day that could become yesterday don't take the worry to tomorrow.  Best wishes and hugs Pearl xx",

I did developed a very tender area and intermittent pain on the operated boob. Also had a slight swelling in my neck/collar bone area. Only thing to do get it checked out. The breast clinic fantastic appointment with consultant who said he thought there was nothing to worry about but for my peace of mind would request an ultrasound.  I'm fine it's scar tissue they were all very kind and they would rather see you about any concerns you have that's why they are there. To treat, help, reassure. Worry helps no one so go on pick up the phone. Hope it gets resolved sooner than later. Hugs pearlxxx",

I'm trying to be patient and not wind myself up to much but of course anxieties do creep in. I tell myself well if it is back I'll be able to do it again that the team is very good at targeting treatments where needed. Until I know I've resigned myself to keep busy and the biscuit tin unfortunately!  Good luck with your results and hope they arrive in the next few days.  Pearl ",

Your honestly not alone there are a lot of us who have been or are in the same situation. I found a smile and a cheery hello usually opened up conversations with others waiting for their appointment and it did help. Also fresh air and walking makes you feel better. Are you on any tablets that could perhaps make you feel low  do have a word with your nurse or oncologist if that's the case . Try and think positive you've had your op it's gone radiotherapy is your belt and braces not long now when your social life can return without hospital appointments apart from your yearly checks. So rest when you need to but celebrate how well you have done and enjoy the new you. By the way I was diagnosed 2015 had lumpectomy ,node removal and radiotherapy and I'm on exemestane tablets. Good days bad days but I give myself a good talking to when I feel down. Try and give yourself something to look forward to and if you need a hug well this site is here for you along with all of us who have come out the other side. I promise you'll look back on this and wonder how you did it and even forget bits of it. Onwards and upwards  Hugs Pearl ",

This lady needs ongoing treatment and had asked for a port? to be fitted which she had to pay for. My question is as she's not a private patient at a private hospital is this the norm for NHS patients? I am led to believe it cost about £1000 it horrified me as I had no idea there was a charge fortunately money was raised to enable this to happen. Has anyone else come across this? ",

They may work in other regions worth asking or go ogling maggie centres may be able to offer advice. I would definitely let friends and neighbours  know the situation give them a chance to help and understand you may be surprised how kind people can be. Also you may be surprised that some off them have been where you are now and are survivors. It's being kind to your self to accept help when needed. I found I needed to protect my arm and boob on the journey home with a cushion. The under arm is the worst and does limit what you can do for a short while. I'm no wimp but found after doing the excercises felt quite exhausted  we are all different listen to your body and don't let your independence hold you back from asking for help if you need it wishing you a good outcome and fast recovery. It's all doable and yes we are stronger than we know. Ironing for awhile took a back seat just looked slightly creased ha ha ",

I find if I talk to my inner self it helps to believe the oncologist and surgeons know what they are dealing with and have taken the best course for a good outcome. Remember more people survive breast cancer these days than in the past. I'm sorry about your mum and of course your anxiety is understandable.  Perhaps have a word with your nurse and she can refer you to counselling which may help you to get your head around it. You've been brave and strong you now just have to believe you can survive this . Sending hugs and positive thoughts your way.",

Try and keep busy it helps us stop imagining the worst.  We've all done it but your doing the right thing getting checked and putting your mind at rest. I want to say scary though it is breast cancer is very very treatable these days. I was diagnosed 2015 had a lumpectomy  lymph nodes removed Radiation and have a mammogram every year and there are no areas of concern. Please take someone with you as you can miss what's been said through sheer anxiety and it would be awful if you missed the words no reason for concern. Besides gives you the excuse to indulge in a bit of cake or retail therapy.  Wishing you the best outcome but know if you need us we are all here to help. You don't hear about the outcome of people still here after 18 or 20 years. So courage my friend and hopefully it is just muscle strain Hugs pearl xx",

      "Content": "Would just like to add that it's a good idea to have a soft cushion to place on the chest area for coming home as seat belts seem to catch the operation site. Ouch!! Also good to go under arm if having node clearance.  Excercises are very important for the arm movement as we need to raise our arms above our head in case we need further treatment of radiotherapy. I didn't receive any instructions for excercises but knew I needed to do them and managed to ask breast care nurse about them who forwarded the excercises to me. Have to say I may have been missed as I ended up on a different ward ( the bowel ward) after my lumpectomy and node removal. No heavy lifting and let hoovering ,ironing etc take a bit of a back seat for awhile. Sometimes people are sent home with drains not alarming just bloody awkward as they are like milk bottles at the end of tubes some people carry them in soft shoulder bags. Again it's only for a short time I only had one drain which was removed the next day before I went home. This site is brilliant for answers to many questions there's usually someone to answer And of course your breast care nurse can be contacted. I found if I rang in the morning someone would get back to me By the afternoon. What a lovely niece you are it's not an easy journey but it is doable wishing you and your aunt a successful outcome and a quick recovery . Onwards and upwards  Pearlxx ",
