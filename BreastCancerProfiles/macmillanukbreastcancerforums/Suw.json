    "Content": "Hiya Sorry to hear about your lump I hope your doctor is right, but any lump should be checked out carefully at the Breast Clinic. I found a lump a few years ago which turned out to be linked to hormones and nothing scary but it was checked out within a week of me seeing my GP even though we both suspected it was to do with hormones. It is worth while making a pest of yourself to be certain.Â  Could you talk to your regular GP about your worries, even if he won't do an examination? Best wishes Suw x",
