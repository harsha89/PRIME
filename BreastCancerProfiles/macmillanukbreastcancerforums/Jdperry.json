      "Content": "Some sent me this today, thought I\u2019d share it: What\u2019s it like to go through cancer treatment? It\u2019s something like this: One day, you\u2019re minding your own business, you open the fridge to get some breakfast, and OH MY GOD THERE\u2019S A MOUNTAIN LION IN YOUR FRIDGE. Wait, what? How? Why is there a mountain lion in your fridge? NO TIME TO EXPLAIN. RUN! THE MOUNTAIN LION WILL KILL YOU! UNLESS YOU FIND SOMETHING EVEN MORE FEROCIOUS TO KILL IT FIRST! So you take off running, and the mountain lion is right behind you. You know the only thing that can kill a mountain lion is a bear, and the only bear is on top of the mountain, so you better find that bear. You start running up the mountain in hopes of finding the bear. Your friends desperately want to help, but they are powerless against mountain lions, as mountain lions are godless killing machines. But they really want to help, so they\u2019re cheering you on and bringing you paper cups of water and orange slices as you run up the mountain and yelling at the mountain lion - \u201cGET LOST, MOUNTAIN LION, NO ONE LIKES YOU\u201d - and you really appreciate the support, but the mountain lion is still coming. Also, for some reason, there\u2019s someone in the crowd who\u2019s yelling \u201cthat\u2019s not really a mountain lion, it\u2019s a puma\u201d and another person yelling \u201cI read that mountain lions are allergic to kale, have you tried rubbing kale on it?\u201d As you\u2019re running up the mountain, you see other people fleeing their own mountain lions. Some of the mountain lions seem comparatively wimpy - they\u2019re half grown and only have three legs or whatever, and you think to yourself - why couldn\u2019t I have gotten one of those mountain lions? But then you look over at the people who are fleeing mountain lions the size of a monster truck with huge prehistoric saber fangs, and you feel like an asshole for even thinking that - and besides, who in their right mind would want to fight a mountain lion, even a three-legged one? Finally, the person closest to you, whose job it is to take care of you - maybe a parent or sibling or best friend or, in my case, my husband - comes barging out of the woods and jumps on the mountain lion, whaling on it and screaming \u201cGODDAMMIT MOUNTAIN LION, STOP TRYING TO EAT MY WIFE,\u201d and the mountain lion punches your husband right in the face. Now your husband (or whatever) is rolling around on the ground clutching his nose, and he\u2019s bought you some time, but you still need to get to the top of the mountain. Eventually you reach the top, finally, and the bear is there. Waiting. For both of you. You rush right up to the bear, and the bear rushes the mountain lion, but the bear has to go through you to get to the mountain lion, and in doing so, the bear TOTALLY KICKS YOUR ASS, but not before it also punches your husband in the face. And your husband is now staggering around with a black eye and bloody nose, and saying \u201ccan I get some help, I\u2019ve been punched in the face by two apex predators and I think my nose is broken,\u201d and all you can say is \u201cI\u2019M KIND OF BUSY IN CASE YOU HADN\u2019T NOTICED I\u2019M FIGHTING A MOUNTAIN LION.\u201d Then, IF YOU ARE LUCKY, the bear leaps on the mountain lion and they are locked in epic battle until finally the two of them roll off a cliff edge together, and the mountain lion is dead. Maybe. You\u2019re not sure - it fell off the cliff, but mountain lions are crafty. It could come back at any moment. And all your friends come running up to you and say \u201cthat was amazing! You\u2019re so brave, we\u2019re so proud of you! You didn\u2019t die! That must be a huge relief!\u201d Meanwhile, you blew out both your knees, you\u2019re having an asthma attack, you twisted your ankle, and also you have been mauled by a bear. And everyone says \u201cboy, you must be excited to walk down the mountain!\u201d And all you can think as you stagger to your feet is \u201cf*ck this mountain, I never wanted to climb it in the first place.\u201d",

      "Content": "Hi i know just how you feel, I was diagnosed on 24th October, 3 days before my sons engagement party, first 2 days I thought and spoke of nothing else, would I be here for their wedding in 2019?, would I ever be a grandmother, my daughter was just about to start a new job, how will my husband cope. Then, hey the party was upon me, buffet to prepare, decorations to sort out, and I actually had a great time (perhaps the wine helped a little). Then I went back to work last Monday, I was dreading telling everyone but they were brilliant, I was really busy and it once again helped me 'forget' for a while. It is getting easier, I still get 'wobbles' still worry what the futrue holds for me. But until I've had my lumpectomy on 17th November I won't know what treatment I need.  Keep trying to be positive, I know it's hard but we can get through this, once you get talking to people it's amazing how common this pesky disease is, nearly every one I've spoken to knows someone who's been there and are fine now. sending you hugs xx julie xx",

I still have another week before my op and will be a couple more weeks before I know the outcome. I just don't know how I'm going to get through it. I feel so scared",
