    "Content": "Hi, I was just wondering if anyone has had any luck with natural alternatives to go along with their conventional treatments. I have seen a long list of suggestions. A lot of suggestions site literature, but I would like to know from people who have had successful experiences with natural products. I have been trying to research this for a while. Since my wife passed away I set a goal to find successful products that would help people with various conditions resulting from cancer, chemotherapy, or radiation. They can be from previous cultures, or used by different cultures around the world. My wife and I found a few, but the FDA puts a lid on products labeled for cancer that are not FDA approved. I would only like to hear about treatments that absolutely work, and not products that might work. Hope to hear from someonje that has had a good or positive experience with treatments, therapies, or remedies alternatively used. I would like to make an easy list so others don't have to pick through a lot of stuff that wastes precious time. Thank you for any input,",
