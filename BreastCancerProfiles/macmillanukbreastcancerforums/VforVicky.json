    "Content": "Hi NM, I'm definitely finding session three much easier to manage, now that I know what the worst symptoms are and having discussed with my oncologist; Anti-thrush meds: liquid oral and tablet oral, because I get it at both ends - so irritating! Steriods; massively help with my mood crash and appetite - usually about four days after infusion. Anti-diarrhea meds: because everything just went through me for two weeks after the first two sessions. I was also prescribed Senna in case of constipation; I haven't used it, but you shouldn't have to suffer. Next time you can meet with your breast care nurse, oncologist or GP, go through the symptoms; I am coping a great deal better each time I have chemo (plus other infusions) because of these drugs; it's worth asking because I've been told most side effects can be improved and hopefully minimises! Hope this helps.",
