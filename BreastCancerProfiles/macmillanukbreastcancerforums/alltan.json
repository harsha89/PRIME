      "Content": "I too have a very dry mouth and no amount of drinking water helps. But I am not on herceptin. Have had chemotherapy FEC/T and am now having radiotherapy. My BC nurse thinks it is a side effect of the chemo but not sure. Would be very interested to hear what your oncologist has to say. Here's hoping that it is only a temporary effect. Good luck Joyce",

      "Content": "Thanks Lindy I finished my chemo end of December and dry mouth only started about three weeks ago and as I am not having Herceptin thought it couldn't be that. No one seems to know if it is caused by chemo or radiotherapy. But am hoping that it doesn't last 8 months or longer! I think we deserve a break having gone through treatments and now just hoping to get better. Good luck and hope we get some answers Joyce",
