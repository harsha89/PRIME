I had a Mastectomy 5 weeks ago with reconstruction, I was discharged with 2 drains in, 1 was removed early as it wasnot draining much and was leaking, the other was removed about 2weeks later.  Your mum will be shown how to measure them! and I did have to go back and forth to get them checked, but that was just the set up here.  Your Breast Cancer Nurse should be able to give you information on what will happen after the op.  Have they said how many nights your Mum will be in hospital ? Also Might be worth finding a long handled bag for her to carry them round in, I used a canvas shopping bag And carried it on my shoulder.  When they removed the first one I didn't even realise it had been done, it was that quick and painless as was the second one.  We are all different, but mine didn't hurt at all. Mum will be limited to what she can do, and that can be annoying for that person especially if they are normally self sufficient.  Hope all goes well. Sending hugs x",

I had my last chemo 12 days ago.  I have also been thinking of Yoga and mindfulness.  Will be looking into both in the New Year, my MCN is visiting me next week so I will ask her if she knows of any courses locally.  Diet wise, I was being quit healthy before all this began, I'd cut most processed food out of my diet last year, including bread, white pasta/rice and refined sugar. This  has slipped whilst on chemo as I was trying to eat half a slice of toast so I could take my anti sickness meds when i got up. I was bought chocolates by friends who came to visit, which I stopped by explaining kindly I was trying to eat as healthily as I could.  So I have decided this will stay relaxed over Christmad and then I will try to go back to my Real Food diet.  Never smoked and don't really drink, odd glass of wine with a meal out, or maybe on a weekend with my partner, I won't stop all together as I have also learnt that I still need to enjoy life.  I like walking so will try to step (pardon the pun) that up too.  Good luck to every one with their new lifestyle choices x",

I seem to get through my surgeries well, but the chemo news which I was hoping not to hear hit me hard.  I think everything caught up with me and my emotions were everywhere.  We have a lot to deal with, you have a new image to come to terms with and that in itself is hard.  Try not to be too hard on yourself, everything takes time.   Don't forget the end game in all of this is to be cancer free, you were probably told when told everything go clear, that there was no evidence of disease, that makes you a member of the NEDdy club, so that's something to celebrate X.

While sat in the waiting area I was telling myself that Many people go through this everyday, it's all for the best reason even though we know some of the side affects can be not so nice, so I gave myself a talking too, braced myself and walked in with my partner holding my hand.  Everyone was so nice and jolly, these nurses and even the volunteer making tea are true Angels. You will be fine. You might want to join the Chemotherapy group on here.  There are not many of us on EC, but many on FEC, so we get similar side effects.  You will probably get an appointment just before your first session where they will go through everything with you, if so, take someone with you, there is a lot to take in, most  will be repeated in the written info they give you to take home. I will send you a friend request so you can PM me if you wish and I will go through it in more detail.  Take care, stay strong x",

      "Content": "I had immediate recon with implant. The lipofilling is to soften the look,  fill in dents and even me up.  I am not overweight for my height but have been trying to trim down slightly, or even keep my weight constant which is a battle against Tamoxifen ! but the article I read says to avoid dieting when going through this procedure.  Think I might relax and enjoy the odd biscuit etc for a while.",

      "Content": "Hi Debs, I had 6 cycles of EC, my last one was 3 Dec.  As already explained, it is very similar to FEC, with much of the same side effects.  Make sure you take the sickness meds as prescribed, don't think that you don't need them.  I found eating little and often helped with nausea.  I was very tired and out of sorts straight after each cycle for a day or two.  I did suffer the chemo mouth, but found the mouthwash given to me (Difflam) was a real help.  My hair started coming out on day 15 of 1st chemo, so I had my head shaved and started wearing a wig, but didn't get on with it so I have been wearing scarves and hats.  Good news is, my hair is starting to grow back !  Stay positive, this is so do able X",

      "Content": "Hi J. Sounds so familiar.  I get so emotional so quickly.  I was only thinking the other day, I will never be the pre diagnosis me, I feel older, fatter, and I don't look like me in the mirror.  But as my wiser partner told me the other morning whilst wiping my tears away after I had a meltdown, it's been over a year since diagnosis, I was always going to get older, time doesn't stop, with age comes more aches and pains, my hair will eventually grow long enough to style, and most people put a bit of weight on through the years too.  I do love him so much.  I agree with fundamentals, we are feeling grief, grief for what has been taken from us, And grief for the old us.  We've somehow got to get our heads round the new us and make the best of what we have, but maybe we need time to grieve first.  I too am trying to keep busy and have weekends away and holidays planned.  Live life to the full X",

Don't be scared.  I am sending this from my hospital bed, I have just had right side mastectomy and immediate construction using an implant.   There are many different options for reconstruction but your nurse will go through them with you.  I knew straight away I wanted reconstruction but it was a bit of a minefield making the right choice.  There are many people on here who have had the different types reconstruction. You will get plenty of advice and support here. My op was on Tuesday and I am hoping to go home today. You will be on hell of an emotional roller coaster at the moment,  take your time to let the news sink in then look into your options.  Take care ",

      "Content": "Hi Gina, I'm 46 with 2 children, divorced but with a new partner, so I am very similar to you. I had a Mastectomy on Tuesday with immediate reconstruction.  Dont know If you are having reconstruction?  I had my concerns too before the op.  It's natural !!  I found it harder hearing I needed a Mastectomy than my diagnosis of Breast Cancer, seems stupid now !  But it wasn't stupid, a couple of weeks ago, I worried about how I would look, how I would feel, how my partner would feel !!  I am a worrier !  My partner has been amazing, suppose it helps him being more of a leg man lol !  He has told me he will love and support me through all of this, he could have run a mile but he hasn't, and I love him more each day for the love he had and is showing me.  My family and my sons too are lending their support.  I have one son moving in today to help me while my partner works this weekend.  I tried to keep busy too, and yes it's those moments when you are all alone that all your concerns hit you.   At home now I am so glad I had the mastectomy, that op has taken away the cancer and given me the chance to see my sons grow into men and have a new life with my partner.  I was lucky not to have node involvement, but even that doesn't necessarily mean it has spread else were.   Please try and look at the bigger picture, the mastectomy hopefully will remove all the cancer, and any other treatments are also to clear you of this nastiness. We are all very lucky to have each other on this forum and the amazing teams at our hospitals.  If you would like to private message me, feel free, and write down all your fears, it may help to get it all off your chest,  I don't know your full history, but I can tell you about my recent surgery if you would like to know about it. I am not a doctor but we can share our worries etc, that's what we do on here, support each other how we can.  Fiona x",
