    "Content": "Evening all :) I've been lurking for a while, since I finally Googled \"breast cancer\". I search on-line for things all day, but decided to avoid doing so immediately - self-protection, presumably. I'm just 61 (how on earth did *that* happen?!), had WLE in early April and SN removed. Great histology results, as good as I could hope for, so I decided immediately that I no longer have cancer. I've been on lots of meds for lots of things for over 30 years, and one day the pharmacist said: But you don't have high blood pressure because the drugs make it normal..... I reckon my splendid surgeon removed my cancer and chucked it in a bucket, so I don't have that either. Finished my 15 tanning sessions last week, and am burnt, itchy, flaky, tender, hot, greasy and sweaty (a bit like those seven post-menopausal dwarfs in the cartoon), and considering never wearing a bra again! Now reading about the next five-years'-worth of drug therapy, with a miserable rictus grin at the thought of experiencing those menopausal symptoms once more... But hey ho... I don't have cancer. I might lurk a bit more, but thanks to all of you, with my very best wishes for whatever happens next....",
