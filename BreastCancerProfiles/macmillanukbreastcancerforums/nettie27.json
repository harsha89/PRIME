    "Content": "Take each day as it comes and deal with what it brings good or bad as you need to.  Make a list of questions you have, never mind how silly you may feel and take it with you to your dr appointment and ask those questions about your particular health situation Write the answers down too or take someone with you, if this helps Don't be afraid of hearing what the dr has to say because it's only then that you will understand your condition and be able to make decisions and regain a sense of calm and control  Worrying and stressing over what maybe only stresses us more. My thoughts are with you and i wish you well. if you want to chat  please do  ",
