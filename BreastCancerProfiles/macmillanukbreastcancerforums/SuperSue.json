Had 3 infections and could not have even thought about looking after anyone not even the fish. I think its a disgrace that people have to cope alone especially with children,  hugs and love to everyone, SuperSue. xxx",

Wonders is this why they only give you 6 chemo, as the body could not cope with any more, if i was just like i was after treatments 1-5 able to go for a small walk, slow stroll round tesco i'd be happy takes me all my effect to get dressed most days. I have not had a drink since finding out i had BC Dec 23rd, apart from 1 guinness on my 3rd week after treatment to bust my iron. Sue. x wanting to be Super again",

Since having my last chemo i just can not get any strength back and the pain are still lingering, aching legs severe lower back pain if i try do anything, I'm only able to walk to the kitchen and back before i start aching and breathing heavy, Just had my 4th lot of antibiotics for an ear infection, i have a cold that will not go away for 2 weeks and a lump on my neck at the front that does not hurt but clicks when i swallow and my ear still hurts. God i sound like a demic. How quickly should i get my strength and independence back, on the 3rd week after the other 5 chemo's i was able to get on with things now i feel 85 (i'm 52) whilst having treatment my partner has been wonderful and done everything for me has he done to much and me sitting here has made me fatigued, if so how can i get back up when i try it puts me back a day.

Before it was found by chance i had been feeling so tired for months but had put that down to being over worked as self employed maybe it was, i tired all the time now but i know that the operation. Having a bad week, plus i decided to stop smoking on the 8th Jan maybe thats why i feeling so low.

I think my thoughts are with everything i have achieved in the last 9 years after being through big shit (long story) everything was going so well everything was excellent, then my brother died and now shit has hit the brick again. why me i try so hard.  Tomorrow is another day, which will great! :-)",
