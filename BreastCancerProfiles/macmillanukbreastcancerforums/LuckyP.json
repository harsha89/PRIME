      "Content": "Thanks Weeblemum I'm loving an afternoon nap most days now!! I'm getting ready for round 2 on Tuesday and feeling much brighter at the mo. Having my next treatment tweaked as I ended up in hospital and had so many side effects. Just hoping the next one is a bit easier to get through now I know what to expect.  On a positive note I've hardly lost any hair, so far the cold cap was worth doing :-)  Hope you've been able to enjoy this lovely weather today x ",

I'm still super tired and achey but managed to get out for a bit of a walk today so feeling a bit brighter now, think I expected to be able to do too much too quickly & underestimated the side effects...hope yours aren't too bad.

      "Content": "Hi Haysie thanks for thinking of me! I got through it & kept the cold cap on the whole time too, like everyone else says the first 20 mins or so are the worst as it's getting colder but I find meditatation helpful so I imagined I was on a snow walk which got me through the first bit then you don't really feel the cold it just kinda felt like a heavy headache...I'm glad I kept it on just got to wait & see now.  As for the chemo I'm so tired & emotional but I guess that's normal so soon after. How are you feeling today?  x ",
