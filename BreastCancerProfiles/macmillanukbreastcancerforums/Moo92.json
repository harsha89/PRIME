      "Content": "Hi Tray41, I\u2019ve been on Letrozole for approx 14 months now. I had Grade 2 BC which was removed by lumpectomy and had 3 weeks radiotherapy in 2018. I was initially put on Letrozole 6 months before to shrink the tumour.  I feel the side effects though are getting worse, so the clinical oncologist advised I speak to my GP and get changed over to Tamoxifen. However, I would have to go 6 weeks without any medication to get the drug totally out my system. Being the coward that I am, I didn\u2019t want to risk it. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019d have to do the same vice versa  though, because as I understand it most people usually, like yourself, have Tamoxifen  first. Hope all goes well for you. Best wishes Moo. X",
