      "Content": "I wonder if I can ask for advice. I've been dealing pretty well for some time now with my secondary breast cancer but can't help thinking there is more to life than working. Financial reasons mean that we have to have two salaries coming in to the house. I've reduced my hours to part time but suffer from fatigue quite often. Of course there is a financial implication to reducing my hours. I seem to be resting at home to get the energy to go to work each day. I'd rather be at home taking care of my home and family as they are my priority. We've started to max the credit card now which is worrying and used all of our savings. I am scared for the future and not sure what to do, who to ask and what are the right questions. I have metastatic breast cancer in the breast, bones and lung. Although my work has let me go for appointments and have rest days but these are all unpaid. I am getting myself in a stress about even the small things now. I want to enjoy life and don't expect massive hand outs just some help. I've been offered massage, osteopathy, mindfulness and yoga but this too comes at a cost for either time off unpaid or a charge for the classes or appointments. I want to boost my wellbeing and be the best I can be through this horrible time. I keep hoping this is just a dream and when I wake up its all been a mistake. I can't help wondering if I'm stressing the small stuff but finances are dictating that I need to be in work. Any suggestions or useful tips would be so much appreciated.",

      "Content": "I watched after much deliberation and so pleased I did. I am living with secondary breast cancer which has spread to the bones, lung and other breast. I've been through breast cancer 11 years ago and didn't think I'd be going through all of this. I shed quite a few tears throughout but it was good for friends and family to see what goes on at appointments and both sides of treatments. I identified completely with the lady with metastatic cancer and she gave me such hope for the future. I hope that I can keep going like she is and that my oncology team are able to keep trying with new advances in medicine.Â ",
