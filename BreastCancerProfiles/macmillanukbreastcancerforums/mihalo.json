      "Content": "I had pneumonia last year that was caused by the cancer (Bowel ca with Lung mets). I hadn't started any treatment but a tumor in my lung beceame enflamed, blocking the bronchus. Mucus then accumulated in the lung causing the infection and the lung to become septic poisoning the rest of my body. I was in a very critical condition and even though I was a fit healthy 29 year old the docs didn't think I would make it through the night...but that I did. If your mum is fighter then she will too. I have since had radiation, chemo and lung resection and luckily no more infections. I am back on treatment now having more radiation and chemo and so far so good. Tell your mum to keep her chin up and stay strong in her mind as well as body. I wish her and you all the love and luck. Cheers Michele xx",

      "Content": "I have a portacath and with kids hanging off me all the time, its fab. No lines to be pulled etc. Swimming is still tricky my onc always said 5 days after it had been accessed was ok but not before to prevent any infections.....that would still give you 2 weeks of swimming....showers were fine straight away though. I'd def get one if you can. Mine was put in day surg, under GA but I ended up staying in overnight as I took AGES to wake up and the local anesthetic had worn off by then and I was inpain, so I stayed in and they gave me some morphine for the night....Nice!!! LOL Its in there now forever if I want I just have to have it flushed every 6 weeks when not on treatment...thats ok cos I get to catch up socially with the girls in oncology while I'm there!!! Cheers Michele (by the way I'm in Oz so may all be a little different over there, but I would guess not too diff....just the payment side of it)",
