      "Content": "Hi Jane When people say that DIEP surgery is the Gold Star of reconstruction, they really aren't wrong.  I had a mastectomy and DIEP reconstruction in March - and there's not a day goes by when I'm not it total awe of what my surgeon has done!  I love my belly boob!! I love my flat stomach. I love the fact that I'd been carrying around spares to fix myself.  The results are spectacular in every way. In the short time it is a lengthy op and a longer recovery time, but in the longer term I think the results are better and less likely to be a need for further surgery.  It's a good investment! I was in hospital for just 5 nights before being allowed to go home.  Everybody told me it wouldn't be as bad as I thought, and it really wasn't, I was amazed that recovery could be so good after such a big op.  I live by myself but I had no problems with mobility or doing what I needed to do, albeit ridiculously slowly and sometimes in quite an inventive fashion!  But every day it got better and easier and I returned to work after 9 weeks.  For me there's been nothing but positives in choosing the DIEP option.  Please don't hesitate to ask me any question whatsoever.

      "Content": "Hi Lizane.  Wow!  I didn't expect to get such a quick response - and one that echoes so much how I'm feeling and thinking.  Thank you so much!  I too feel that I can't read any more websites or look at one more photo!!  I am a great believer in the power of gut instincts and I just love your doctor's comment - yes, I am very precious indeed and I am certainly worth a good investment and a bit of time!!  My gut instinct before my meeting today with the plastic surgeon was that I most definitely did not want implants, and I did not want to be \"inflated\"!  How I then came away with the feeling that this might be the way to go I'm not now sure.  Using my own tissue is going to be better for sure - and I've now binned the silicone!  After talking through the DIEP today it seemed a lot less daunting than I had thought, the surgery and recovery is longer but the results were terrific, and in the grand scheme of things 8 weeks or so is just a blip.  Good luck with your surgery, I am sure it will be just fine, I will be thinking of you - I am a newcomer to this site but one message that comes across loud and clear is that it's never as bad as you think it's going to be.  Thank you again, you've been a great help.   Sharon X",

      "Content": "Hi Cathy.  The LD flap would have been my preference too but the plastic surgeon said I only had enough fat on my back for an A cup which I was surprised about as I'm a very \"healthy\" size 12 and 36C.  The more I think about this today the more sure I am that I should stick to my gut instinct and not have implants at all, as a whole or part of the procedure - if I'm not happy or confident with that idea now, it's only going to worry me if I choose it.  I've been told the DIEP procedure will take 10 hours, which also includes a lift/reduction of the good boob.  It's a long time (but will be more sleep than I've had in a long time!), am expecting recovery to take 10 weeks but as Lizane said yesterday, we're certainly worth the investment!   And, I get a tummy tuck thrown in for free - if they could just do a little nose and jowl job too while they're at it, I'm sorted!   Thank you so much for replying, this discussion forum is just incredibly helpful and supportive - and inspirational!",

      "Content": "Hi Angela.  That is good to hear and very reassuring.  Also made me laugh about you drawing the line at them using tissue from your bum - guess that really is the bottom line!! Boom boom!! I've thought about nothing but flaps for weeks, about moving and tunnelling various bits of my body elsewhere, feel like I'm about to be turned into a human Rubiks Cube!  All very clever, if a little freaky to me. But I have now come to the same conclusions as you and made my decision.  I can live with being wonky and can always have implants at a later stage, at the moment I don't feel comfortable about the idea of implants and don't want to go into surgery feeling more worried about the outcome and the future than I do already.  So a DIEP it is for me.  Am a little anxious about the pain and difficulty in getting about, especially as I live by myself and don't have friends or family in popping-in distance, but it's only for a short while. Can I ask you stupid question - you said that it's the clearance that has been most painful.  Sorry if I'm being a la la, but what is that?? Thank you! Sharon",

There's such a vast wealth of knowledge and experience on this site, it's been so invaluable - I feel so much calmer and more prepared than I did on Monday, I feel ready now. Thank you. Sharon",

I'm sure everything will go well on Friday, and I do look forward to hearing from you. Sharon",

      "Content": "Hi Julie I have just taken the decision to have a DIEP reconstruction, so to hear what you say just gives me more confidence that I've taken the right decision and it won't be as bad, painful or debilitating as I'm imagining.  And I feel incredibly fortunate and blessed that I don't need chemo and I keep thinking that once this is over, in just a few months, that will be it (I hope).  I am lucky. Am so impressed that you can find the willpower to workout for such a long time, you sound like a very strong person in every sense. And am totally with you re not feeling a lesser person - my sense of well being and worth ain't in my boobs!! Thank you. Sharon",

      "Content": "Hi I'm 47 years old and have recently been told that I need to have a mastectomy on one breast.  I am very lucky in that the cancer has not spread to my lymph nodes and I will not need radiotherapy or chemotherapy afterwards.  I have decided to have a reconstruction at the same time and today met with a consultant today to talk through options.  I have come away with 3 alternatives for the surgery and am finding it very difficult to decide which route to take.  So after hours and hours and hours of Googling I've decided it would simply be best to ask those who have been there about their experiences!  I've narrowed it down to either having the breast reconstructed from the back tissue with an expandable implant, or having an expandable implant and the other breast uplifted/reduced.  I just don't know what to do and would love to hear from you!  Thank you!!",
