    "Content": "My grandmother died of ovarian cancer 14 years ago after fighting it for 6 years and she was above the age of 50. Two of my mother's cousins (from her mother's side) had breast cancer, one of them was maybe 50 or in her early 50s and the other one was in her mid 40s. Both live in a different county and lead a different lifestyle. These are the only ovarian and breast cancer cases in even my extended family. I was wondering is it it possible for two sisters to get breast cancer which is not hereditary? and is my mother or me at an increased risk of getting breast cancer ?",
