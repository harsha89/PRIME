    "Content": "Hi I had 6 infusions FEC and Docetaxol it\u2019s the FEC that causes hair loss and it is quick by ur second unfusion it would be gone the D isn\u2019t as harsh, I used the cold cap through out I lost 60/70 % my hair but when I had the D my hair started to grown back which meant when I finished (my last infusion was December) I was able to and get my hair  styled and had full head hair no patches!!, I didn\u2019t need use my wig until my 3rd infusion this was due to cold cap, it is uncomfortable but manageable  Good luck your treatment ",
