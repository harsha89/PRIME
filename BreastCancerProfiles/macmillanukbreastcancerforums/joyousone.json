    "Content": "Hi Caroline Our time line for treatment seem fairly aligned, I had my first session of chemotherapy last Tuesday and had almost worried myself sick in advance of it. I have had the first dose of Epirubicin, ( hope I'm spelling that right ) and I have three more lots of this followed by five sessions of CMF - three drugs given in one dose I think. Apart from some strange tingling in very odd places it all went very smoothly. I felt a little nauseous, nothing that some crystalised ginger didn't sort out, and a bit lightheaded too. I know this is only my first session, haven't dared to ask if it gets worse with every one, but it does seem bearable. I haven't forgotten that we all respond differently but the side effects do seem to effect many. I have had chronic indigestion over the last two days, which I've never suffered from before, so this seems to be another symptom of chemo. Everyone at my clinic was so supportive, staff and patients were giving advice and telling me to listen to my body. I really hope everything goes well for you and don't forget you are allowed to be scared!! This site is a font of knowledge, help and information, I check in every day - even if I don't write anything. Good luck joyousone",
