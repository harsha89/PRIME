      "Content": "Mine came back as soon as my treatment finished. Fortunately it was a local recurrence. I had a Mastectomy and another year of herceptin. I have been cancer free for 2 years now although I have a 50% chance of it returning. I love my life and have taken up new hobbies. It's a worrying time for you but hold on in there. Sending hugs xx",

He recommended E45 cream. 4 months later he performed a biopsy and there were 2 small tumours. How can anyone know just by feeling. I have grade 3 HER2 + breast cancer.",

I can feel lumps in the axillary tail and under my affected arm pit. My oncologist opinion is the lumps have the features of reactive lymph nodes other than mastastasis. I am confused and worried. Do nodes grow back?",

      "Content": "Last year I felt well enough to restart my fostering career. During the fostering assessment period I had local recurrence. The agency contacted my oncologist for a prognosis of which ,silly me, I asked for a copy. It read \"Her initial prognosis (2010) was to give her an estimated five year survival approximately 50%, but unfortunately on Feb 2013Â  she developed a breast recurrence. She is grade 3 ER neg,PR neg, HER2 pos invasive ductal cancer. Obviously her prognosis now is consequently worse\" I have been confused and worried and quite angry really. I wasn't given a prognosis at the beginning. Is this statistical jargon? It stopped my career of 19 years now I feel as if I have no future.",

      "Content": "Thanks for this. I realistically know its statistical but it has cast a cloud over my future as my 19 year fostering career ends when my YP reaches 18yrs next year. I adopted a little girl and she is only 9 years and I plan to be there for her until adulthood. I am scared to be honest and sometimes fall into the trap of doom and gloom, it's going to be hard to start a new career at 56. Do other employers ask for this level of health information? I thought I may have been protected by disability act?",
