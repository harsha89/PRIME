      "Content": "Hi all, finished breast cancer treatment end of August this year.   Had mastectomy in May, still on Herceptin.   Feeling very lost and let down.  Since surgery in May did not get follow up appt and not one person has looked at wound.  Is this normal, never had any type of surgery before so have no idea what to expect.   When I phoned the bcn she said nothing came back in pathology so why do you need to see surgeon.  I live in Northern Ireland and thinks seem a bit different here.   Bcn are terrible, no contact or support at all.  I asked for appt to see oncologist to answer some queries I had and he was too busy!!   What happens now re check ups etc, what should I expect.  When is your next Mammo, when they say a year is that after diagnosis, surgery or what.  I have not been physically examined for about eight months.   Feel very ignored and lost. ",
