    "Content": "Hi Clair I'm new to all this, read the comments, surfed the pages. My problem I guess is that everything has happened so fast, diagnoses, ops, results and now I'm waiting to start my chemo and I'm finding I've got too much time on my hands to worry. I was diagnosed on 7th Feb with a 22mm tumour, I had a masectomy and sentinel node removal on Feb 10th and then because cancer cells were found in the sentinel node I had a lymph node clearance on 24th. All my nodes were clear, thank God. So it's been very quick hardly enough time to get my head round each stage. I'm fed up with pain the node operation is causing, but reassuring to know that it will get better and i need to keep working on the exercises. I'm waiting for the oncology appointment to map out the treatment, but desperate to get going, with 3 boys aged 8,9 and 11 I want to know how wiped out I'm going to be. Guess I've got to be patient.",
