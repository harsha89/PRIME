    "Content": "Hello simba4me & others I have only been on Sandoz Letrozole for 2 months. I try not to read up on all the side effects possible just deal with them one at a time. At the start I could not get to sleep normally - that has now passed. Recently had some blood tests taken and its increased my cholesterol - so my GP and I will now watch that every few months but the big one is sweating.  I do not have hot flashes as such but when I exert myself - like house cleaning or similar my hair is dripping wet at the back of my neck and other places.  Its a new thing for me as I never used to sweat much and I know I am not doing a full workout to justify it either! I am probably not seeing so many people socially because of this while I come to terms with another 'new normal' and I only have another 5 or so years to go!!! If it keeps cancer at bay then I will do it. I also have melanoma (there is nothing to take for that to prevent it coming back) so I am glad I can actually do something to prevent the breast cancer returning. My only suggestion if you can't do it anymore is perhaps change to Tamoxifen - has already been suggested to me by my surgeon. Hugs galore xxxJ",
