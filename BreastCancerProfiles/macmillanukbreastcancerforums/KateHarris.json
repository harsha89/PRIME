    "Content": "I'm really hoping to be able to have my mastectomy followed by immediate reconstruction, mainly so that I don't have to undergo two operations and therefore have less trauma both to my body and emotionally.  I've been advised that this will only be possible if I don't need any further treatment which I won't know until I've had my sentinel node test next week.  I've been told this is because the treatment may not be as effective and can also affect the reconstructed breast.... I have small boobs so they will just be using fat from my stomach.   Hope this is of a little bit of help. Best, x",
