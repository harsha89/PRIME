      "Content": "My husband does not always remember to ask me how I am and even makes comments about me being off work and doing nothing all day while he has to go out to work.  I believe that most men don't mean to be insensitive it is just the way they are. I came out of hospital on the Tuesday following my mastectomy surgery and by the Friday my husband was unwell with stomach pains.  On the Saturday afternoon I called my brother-in-law to take him to A&E where they had to give him morphine to take the pain away.  He suffered for around two weeks after that with stomach pain and sickness which was caused by a simple stomach bug being multiplied by stress causing more stomach acid than normal.  I ended up looking after him and my two boys who were aged nearly 5 and 2½ at the time. He felt really guilty about not being able to do much for me at a time when he should have been looking after me and not the other way around but he really was not coping with the stress we found ourselves under.  The pressure was also getting to the boys who suddenly found they had two ill parents and life suddenly changed. I know he loves me even as a baldy with one boob and don't push him into saying it all of the time although I know that life is not like that for everyone.  I am lucky to have a lot of help from my parents and my in-laws as my husband works full time.  As my consultant told me, don't try to be a superwoman and take the support from whoever offers it. Good luck x",

      "Content": "I have completed three sessions of FEC with only minor side effects but have recently had my first Taxotere alongside Herceptin on 24th January.  After a couple of days I started aching which I was warned about by the chemo nurse.  By Saturday and Sunday I was in agony with the pain in my back which kept coming and going and felt like labour pains.  I took paracetamol and ibuprofen but it only took the pain away for short periods of time. I have not had the really bad pain since early hours of Monday but I have stomach cramps and bloated feeling constantly and have had regular diarrhea.  Can anyone tell me if this is normal with Taxotere and whether it gets any better.  The doctor gave me Tramadol and Voltarol muscle rub to try if the pain comes back.  I took one Tramadol and the stomach cramps were worse than ever so unsure now whether that was a coincidence or not. I have tried being brave so far but I got really depressed at the weekend knowing that I have a further two session of this treatment to come. Any advice greatly appreciated. Jo",

      "Content": "Your experience with TAX sounds just like mine. The nurses had told me that FEC is so toxic and TAX is not so bad for your body that I thought things would get better rather than worse and I could get my life back to normal.  I had even mentioned to work about the possibility of coming back in between sessions so I do feel very demoralised now. I did try a hot water bottle with the pain and it did ease it a little eventually but I am panicking now about the next session starting.  Has anyone got any tips on suitable food to ease the digestive discomfort?  ",
