    "Content": "Yesterday I sat next to my younger sister as she was told she has to have chemo. 2 weeks ago the Doctor mentioned the 'Cancer' word and it knocked us for six. Yesterday we dared to hope she might just need radiotherapy and it would be a walk in the park for her (we know this probably isn't true). But hearing the word chemo and the fact that it has gone to her lymph system, I watched my sister shake. I don't think we've ever felt so scared. I now need to be the best support I can for her. Her chemo starts in about 2 weeks, how can we support her with nutrition. I don't know where to start, I so want to help her nail this horrible disease. catchapman",
