    "Content": "Hello - reading your post could almost be word for word what happened to me (43 year old mum of two, lumpectomy etc) however I must be a week or so behind you as I\u2019m still waiting for post op results (28th). I\u2019m trying not to worry but the surgeon has already said he\u2019s concerned about the margins being clear due to the location of the tumour. It\u2019s been really helpful though reading the replies which explains it all better so thank you. I too will be considering mastectomy if this hasn\u2019t worked. Hope all goes well and try and enjoy Christmas- I don\u2019t know about you but it\u2019s all just been a big blur so far but I\u2019m trying for the sake of the children - just feel so guilty getting this and the worry it causes, especially at this time of year! Take care.Â ",
