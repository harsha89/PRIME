    "Content": "hi, my mum has recently been diagnosed with early stage breast cancer (massive shock) as I'm sure it is to many ladies after a cyst drainage. The decision was made that a mastectomy and reconstruction was the best option. As they explained she's 45 and a lumpectomy would cause too much disfigurement.  Since finding out to now it's been 2 months and she has just found out it's not spread and all is clear which we are eternally grateful for and are aware we are ever so lucky ... But she's started to become down and finds the reconstruction hard to understand, and has said it isn't hers, it's lumpy and keeps going hard and the pain and discomfort for 2 weeks...is this normal?  I want to support her as best as I can but I'm not sure how to do this, I speak to her and  cuddle her and try to be there but I know I cannot support her as I don't know how it feels. Wondered if some insight from some more amazingly brave women on here would help me to be there for her more than I have been.    Stay strong ladies. All my love xxxxxx  ",
