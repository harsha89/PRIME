      "Content": "Couldn't agree more with all your posts...if only I had been a bit more assertive and not just accepted it was just a large cyst I wouldn't be in the mess I am now! However, I too was made to feel like I was wasting their precious time and so I merrily went on my way accepting their diagnosis from their mammogram, ultrasound and their examination even though it was clearly visible with the naked eye and had distorted my nipple etc. ! Left it 6 months before going back to the GP to ask for another referral and this time another Radiographer immediately realised that it was an Invasive Ductal Carcinoma and also confirmed that it was there on the earlier Mammogram etc. Fingers crossed I was just an unlucky one and hopefully yours is just a cyst but I do wish I had insisted on a biopsy and stood my ground. Lesson learnt the hard way! Good luck and the very best of wishes. Jo X",

      "Content": "Thanks Jess for forwarding these posts to your fundraising team. I am so glad this topic has been raised as I was starting to think it might just be me being haunted by Macmillan adverts!!! It really seems your fundraising teams are trying to surpass themselves with each new batch of adverts at how insensitive and unnecessarily graphic they can be. We have 4 children and we all groan each time one of your adverts appears and have even tried avoiding Channel 4 in particular as every advert break seems to have one. I'm sure if your fundraising team consulted with us, the people whose lives you are trying to improve, they would understand that whilst we are grateful for the fab support your charity gives us please don't continuously ruin our brief attempts for a few minutes peace from our predicaments that we might gain by watching TV! Many thanks Jo    ",
