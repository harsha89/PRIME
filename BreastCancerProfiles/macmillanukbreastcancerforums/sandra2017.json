      "Content": "I am sad and angry about these people who feel breast cancer is a non issue!  They call it the sexy cancer.  What does that mean?  I have had breast cancer twice and believe me, there is nothing sexy about cancer.  I had breast cancer the first time when I was young.  I went through 6 weeks of radiation that scared my lungs and eventually caused a chronic lung disease.  During this time my husband and I seperated due to him having an affair.  Yes, this happened during cancer.  What is sexy about surgery, radiation and your husband\u2019s betrayal?   Once again the cancer reared it\u2019s ugly head just a few months ago. Not everyone is a candidate for reconstruction. The radiation I had the first time completely destroyed my muscle, therefore, no reconstruction.   I have a sink hole the size of a fist.  I was not a candidate for Chemo because of the chronic lung infection. I also can never have radiation again.   The oncologist said my rib cage would turn to saw dust.  So what are my chances that the cancer will return? Very high.  So now I am on medication to eliminate all estrogen in my body.  Side effects are many.  Surviving cancer is one thing, but thriving afterwards is another.  My advice to women that are so dead set against the PINK movement; is to stop getting your annual mammograms if you are NOT AFRAID of getting breast cancer.  I certainly acknowledge other horrible cancers, but my fight is for ALL CANCER patients.  How insensitive can you be to think breast cancer doesn\u2019t kill.  So much I want and need to say.  By the way,   The 2nd cancer was missed 3 times, mammogram, ultrasound and MRI.  It was identified as scar tissue.  But, my gut said it was cancer.  My own sibling actually wore a T-Shirt that said  NOT ALL CANCER IS PINK, but of course she has never experienced the nightmare!   I am a forgiving and giving person, therefore I am praying for all women and men that are suffering emotionally and physically with any type of cancer.  It is Not a competition.",

      "Content": "Hi Helen.  I have to smile because you seem very concerned about me.  I guess I used the wrong word to begin my discussion.  I am more hurt than anything.  My Dad passed at a young age with Lung Cancer, brother had testicular cancer, nephew just finished treatment for bile duct cancer and my aunt passed with throat cancer.  I am very empathetic to any and all cancer.  I just could never in a million years say one negative thing about cancer of any type.   Cancer is a devastating diagnosis no matter the stage or type. It all must be treated or it kills.  So yes I am offended when people say things like you get a free boob job, even though for many of us it isn\u2019t possible. Every person with cancer has a different experience.  Can\u2019t use a wide brush to describe it.  Thanks for your concern. Sometimes a person just has to be able to express their heart.  ",

      "Content": "Sandy so sorry to hear that you have also had BC.  this is the 2nd time for me.  I had it 20 years ago.  Had a lumpectomy with 7 weeks radiation.  I developed a rare lung disease called Bronchiectasis Caused by scaring some of which is contributed to radiation and asthma.  I also have a Chronic Lung infection known as MAC.  I cannot undergo Chemo due to active infection.  I have a chronic cough and cough up pure blood from time to time.  It is a slow growing infection, However if I have Chemo it would take off like wild fire.  I was diagnosed in 2005.  Never smoked.  These things just happen. You can google bronchiectasis and MAX INFECTION.  I wouldn\u2019t worry that you have this as it is a rare lung disease. Let me know how your test comes out. Good to hear from you.  Breast cancer is not a cake walk.  It is cancer and It is scary.  HUGS I j",

      "Content": "Sandy I had a broncoscopy in Sep 14.  I am glad they are doing this for you.  Hopefully it will shed a light on what is causing your problem.   Have you had a CT, Breathing test and/or Pet Scan.  I was diagnosed with my lung condition by CT Scan which identified the Bronchiectasis, but it took a broncoscopy to determine the type of infection I had along with the underlying Bronchiectasis.  Are you a smoker?  I never smoked.  My condition is caused from scaring in the bronical tubes.  Pneumonia, whopping caugh as a child, radiation treatments and bronchitis during my life caused the scaring which lead to the lung disease.  I had a mastectomy last May.  In June my oncologist ordered a pet scan from top of head to mid upper legs.  Of course I knew the Bronchiectasis and MAC infection would show up on the Pet Scan.  Did you have a Pet Scan or did your oncologist do a bone scan?  A Pet Scan shows internal organs.  When is your broncoscopy?  Much Love to you.  If you have a any questions you think I may be able to answer, please write to me.  Supporting one another is a blessing we both receive.  ",

      "Content": "No one on this site said anything about Breast Cancer being a non issue.  I was definitely letting off steam.  There is currently a lash back regarding breast cancer receiving more funds raised than any other cancer  Some people feel that breast cancer is common and has a high survival rate, therefore does not deserve all the attention given to this disease even though 1 out of 8 women get BC and 40000 women in the US will die this year.  According to the ACS BC kills more women than any other cancer except Lung Cancer.  If you google outrage regarding attention given BC you will see how hurtful their statements are to those of us that have had breast cancer and those who lost the battle.  I want a cure for all cancers.  I guess I came across really strong, but when my own sister sports a T-Shirt that states NOT ALL CANCERS ARE PINK meaning that BC is over stated, well, it hurts.",

      "Content": "Yes I agree they should be ashamed, but it is all about money.  Not that many years ago women with breast cancer were embarrassed to tell anyone they had breast cancer.  It was the disease to be ashamed of until some brave women stepped up and started a movement to bring awareness to this deadly disease.   Breast cancer use to be a death sentence until there became some what of a \u201cME TOO\u201dmovement from these brave women before us.  I can\u2019t believe that ovarian cancer is also using this negative campaign since Breast Cancer is so closely related to ovarian cancer.  My 1st cousin was diagnosed with BC this past Sep.  She will be finished with her Chemo next week.  Her cancer was very aggressive and she would not have survived another year without treatment.  Her Oncolgist advice nurse told her that she had made calls almost every day to give results of pathology reports.  She told many women the bad news\u2014You have breast cancer.  She said she never thought a thing about it; just doing her job, until she personally got the call.  That is how I see this negativity - They have not got the call!!!!!!  My sister said to me, your breast does not define you as a woman as she proudly parades her boob job.  I am just hurt. I am the type of person that prays for and worries about everyone I love.  I just would love to see all us breast cancer victims speak up against this nasty campaign.  I felt like if I could write this out, I could write it out of my heart, but I know I need to speak up so I have started here. Even though BC has received so much funding, there is still NO cure.  Mammograms are great and have been improved, but still miss 20% of BC.  I am determined to reach out to other BC patients to share and support in anyway I can.  As women, well, that is just what we do.  Anyone else out there that feels upset over this issue, please speak up so other women don\u2019t feel ashamed to share their stories to help save lives.  There is power in numbers and there is a lot of us that have or had BC.  Thanks for listening.  ",
