How do others feel about drinking after treatment and does anyone feel guilty they may have caused their cancer because of alcohol?",

      "Content": "Hi Karan I have dieted for most of my life, but after all my treatment finished I decided I didn't want to become a, mm I don't know not a problem or burden but maybe I just wanted to keep my independence. I realised to do this I had to control my weight. I did not join any club but my daughter in law and step daughter lost quite an amount of weight on the slimming diet. I had never tried this before and when they say you don't have to be hungry it is true. Yes you have to give up a lot of foods, but we all know what they are and to be honest because I kept full on the plethora of foods I could eat plenty of I found I didn't want chocolate and crisps. Good luck Karan.",
