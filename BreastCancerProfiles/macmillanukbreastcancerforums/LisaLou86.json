    "Content": "Hi Louisey2 I'm very interested in talking to you, my best friend starts Gemcarbo this week, She has similar to you.Â  I have found a lot of success stories online from this, which I hope is true as I don't believe there much else they can offer my friend after. And I know she would be very pleased to talk to someone going through similar stages and treatments. is there any other way I could contact you, or you me. I have only just registered with this site as I seen your post and you are literally going through the same. my friend unfortunately does not have the strength to go through all of these Q&AS, So I do that for her, and you both seem in the exact same stages of diagnoses and treatments. I would be happy to give my personal email/phone number to keep up to date. She is due her first Gemcarbo next week,have you had yours yet? I truly hope yours will be a success and live to tell on the story to others. but my friend and family is at deperate measures now, this is the last option I believe xx",
