      "Content": "Hi Angela im eight week post DIEP op, mine was delayed 6 years, it was the best thing I have done but I knew from the very beginning that this is what I wanted when all my treatment was done. The surgeon I first chose was a man and I was told I needed to loose 2.5 stone but due to life and tamoxifen I found this very hard to do, to cut a long story short he would not perform the surgery unless I lost the weight so really I think I just gave up, then one day out of the blue I had a phone call off the hospital to go and see another surgeon, so I took myself and my daughter off to see the lady and what a wonderful person she was, she greeted me with a hug  and couldnt understand why they had told me to loose so much weight, im a big lady I weighed 14.5 stone, the surgeon told me to go home and put weight on the bigger the belly the bigger the boob, I am a 38 F at the minute. Needless to say I went home with a smile on my face lol. I had been put on her waiting list which was about 12 month but she was definitely worth waiting for. I actually waited only 8 month when I got the call I was so excited. I went into the hospital the night before and they explained what they was going to do, they was doing the diep and a reduction on my right breast, I was so excited that night I couldn't sleep lol. I went down for surgery at ten o clock and came back up at six thirty, I was fine my husband and family was there to great me, I was chatting to them for a couple of hours till I got tired and they went home. I didn't really look at my new boob till the next day and I didn't feel it properly till then, the nurses kept saying it was a big flap lol, I didn't have any pain and didn't need pain meds at home for the surgery but I did need pain meds for the back ache took me a couple of weeks to get my sleep back to normal. I didn't have the reduction done at the same time, this will be done at a later date, I have had no restrictions with movement and was home on day four. This is the best decision I have made and I am grateful for all the surgical team who helped me achieve my new boobie or as I like to call them pinky and perky. Hope this has helped you and anyone else who is looking to have the surgery, if you need any more info please ask, I am doing a photo diary of my progress to.    ",

      "Content": "hi im just writing this to see how many people have been left with permanent hair loss after chemotherapy. im two years out from my last chemo, my hair has grown back round the back and sides but it is very thin. It is very sparse on top like male pattern balding.  I am unable to go without a wig and was wondering what other people are doing about the situation, I have been refused funding for an hair system three times because it is not under extreme circumstances. Any feed back would be lovely, also what type of wigs do you ladies prefer ie full lace, monofilament etc etc.",
