      "Content": "Hello everyone, I am having my second chemo cycle next week and I have a daft question. My first was in the morning and I was told to take my Emend at breakfast for a 10 a.m. chemotherapy session (and then for two days afterwards at the same time). My next chemotherapy session is at 4 p.m. I assume the Emend should be later? I can ask when I go for my pre-chemo assessment/oncology appointment, but thought I would see what wise women here had to say first! Hope everyone currently in the chemo club is doing okay (and, of course, all those at different stages in this pesky process). xx",

I am bit a nauseous and strangely disconnected, but I got out for a walk this morning and spoke to my oldest friend, both of which helped enormously. I am going to get a portacath fitted as it turns out my veins aren't great. All the tips about timing steroids, drinking water and trying to get out a bit have helped me so far. We'll see what the next week or so brings. Pesky process power to everyone! xx",

I have my first chemo (EC-accelerated Taxol) session on Thursday this week and am apprehensive but also strangely keen for it just to begin. Like you, I am standing by with wigs and hats (I am not doing the cold cap). I will continue to drop in here and see how you're doing. I keep reminding myself all through this pesky process that this is positive treatment. Not sure it always works and I sometimes do feel overwhelmed, but mostly I try to be in the moment and think I am taking all the right steps to getting better. Walking alongside you Lemongrass and wishing you only good things. xx",

      "Content": "I was diagnosed with BC on Friday. It wasn't really a shock as I have been working through investigations for a couple of weeks and had a strong intuition, particularly when the swelling didn't respond to antibiotics (it was thought it might be an infection). In amongst the difficult news, there was lots of positive information - it appears to be an early presentation and slow-developing. Surgery looks likely and some combination of medical treatment(s) too. I had further biopsies of my lymph nodes after I heard the news and am going for CT and bone scans this week which do worry me, I admit. I am afraid that the positives I heard on Friday may be snatched away and every twinge, cough and ache plunges me into anxiety. I am trying to stay calm and take it all one step at a time. I just wanted to thank everyone who posts here for making that easier. I never thought I would be spending my Sunday afternoon this way, but I am and it is wonderful to know there are so many people who get it and are generous enough to share their stories. I hope you don't mind if I hang around . . .",

      "Content": "Hello Mvi2017, you are not intruding at all. I am so sorry that you are in such a worrying place too. It is horrid and in some ways, I think it was worse before i had the diagnosis (even thought that was the last thing I wanted to hear) because the uncertainty is so difficult. I don't mind you asking at all, but I should stress that I am new to it all and from what I understand, everyone is different, so my experience may be atypical. I am still in a bit of a limbo. I know I don't have inflammatory BC and that it is hormone receptive and HER negative. It looks like it is relatively early presentation and is grade 2. I am not sure about much more yet as we are spending this week gathering more information, based on the lymph node biopsies, blood tests, CT and bone scans. My scans are today and tomorrow. The MDT will add those findings to my earlier results and meet on Thursday to discuss the plan. I am expecting to go in to see the oncologist next Monday to talk about medical options and the surgeon the following Tuesday to talk about surgery. It seems likely it will be a combined approach, but not certain yet and there are lots of details to work out. I have been bowled over by the care I have received from everyone at The Marsden. It has been extraordinary and really makes me feel that I am in tremendous hands. I would love everything to be 'sorted' but I understand it takes a little while, so I am trying to stay calm, be patient and trust in these remarkable people who I know are experts with my interests at the centre of all they do. It isn't always easy, but I do feel fortunate to have access to such great care. I know it is hard, but hang in there and know that whatever happens on Friday, you will have brilliant professionals to walk alongside you every step of the way. I hope beyond words that you have good news and can be reassured. I will be thinking of you and please know I am around to talk online if that is useful, irrespective of outcome. I will keep all crossed for you on Friday. ",

I know there is nothing to be done about the uncertainty, so I will have to learn to accept it/distract myself/carry on. Knowing that others are wrestling with it and also have managed to live their lives whilst coping with uncertainty/anxiety helps and inspires me to do the same.  I will keep hanging around, reading and facing this strange new phase carrying the welcome hug with me for strength. ",

I wish I didn't have to be there, but under the circumstances, they make it as okay as it can be.  To answer your question about symptoms, I guess for me the worries were my age (I am in the right group) and speed with which my lump appeared which made me wonder about inflammatory disease. However, I think what I most learned from that was to try not to speculate and infer. It is really tough not to do so, but it isn't helpful.  Are there activities and people who bring you joy that you can surround yourself with this week? I found the smallest things brought me huge pleasure and distraction whilst waiting for the results of the biopsies. Being in the moment and really present with those i love rather than in my head was hard to do, but it did make a difference. I am holding you in my thoughts - what time is your appointment on Friday? xx",

Like you, I found the seeking further information and waiting for the results of scans really hard. Uncertainty is just horrible. Fortunately, when I went back for the results the following week, they showed no spread. I hope you can trust your clinical team who will be there to do what is right for you no matter what the findings.

I am used to reading medical correspondence due to my job, but nothing prepares you for the impact of it all in writing when they're documenting our lives which have been so rudely interrupted by this pesky process.  I have concluded that I will probably have an emotional response and that is okay. I also know that it will pass, but there is nothing wrong with feeling the emotions and expressing them. I now recognise the distinctive envelope and sometimes decide I won't open it immediately and choose to do it at a time when I have some privacy. I'm really sorry you're feeling scared. I often do, but again I go with it and believe that I will be able to regroup when I'm ready. The one thing I am discovering is that emotions swing about a lot during this process. I also remind myself that everyone is scared - that is the normal response and every person who has walked this path before us probably felt frightened at some point. Hang in there. Come here and vent/offload when you need to do so and know we are thinking of you. xx",

I was warned when I had my CT scan in particular that it wasn't uncommon to pick up things that turned out to be nothing at all, but did have to be investigated further. I really hope that your team is able to move things on quickly for you.  I begin chemotherapy tomorrow and I would be lying if I said I wasn't apprehensive especially after the formal assessment and consent process yesterday which was a bit overwhelming. Tears have fallen today, but I am reminding myself that a) even the nasty side effects will mean that cancer is being treated fast and effectively and b) it is a blip in my life and it will end. Who knows whether those two thoughts will always sustain me, but they have helped a bit today and overnight. I have also busied myself painting my nails black (allegedly it helps protect them), so I am mostly pretending to be a 48 year old goth what with the black nails and the glum face!

I have felt scared and overwhelmed sometimes, but I have learned that I can get through those by not being 'brave' and denying it, but by admitting it to myself, here on the forum and to trusted friends and family. I also remind myself that this is a wave to ride and sometimes it is easier than others, but there is no 'right' way to be or to feel. Take whatever help and support you need and try not to be critical of being vulnerable - we need more than ever to be as kind to ourselves as we are to others and to understand that to accept help can be so much harder than it is to give help, but it is just as precious.
