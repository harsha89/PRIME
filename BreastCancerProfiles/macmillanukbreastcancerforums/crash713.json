    "Content": "i completed my taxol at the end of november. I had a fairly good experience with it. I did not have nausea - my hair started growing back. All i did experience was some minor body/bone paid and a little tingling in my toes, but only when i wore sneakers. If i wore sandals, it never bothered me. I hope you handle it as well as i did! my oncology team was pleased. good luck! :)~",
