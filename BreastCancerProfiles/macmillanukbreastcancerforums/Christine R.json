      "Content": "Hi Tessa, I can understand your worry. I have found that since my surgery I feel all sorts of lumps and bumps that weren't there before. I think the worst of them is a swelling near the site of surgery. I have come to the conlcusion that this is caused by scar tissue as all my subsequent mammograms have been clear. Good luck for Tuesday anyway, I hope it all turns out fine for you. Let us know how it goes will you? Best wishes, Christine xx",

      "Content": "Hi Jozelee, like Glenna I had a lumpectomy on a larger tumour - 2.5cm and also had an axillary clearance. I also find that the breast I had operated on is perkier than the other. I am a bit smaller on this side, the surgeon told me I had a third of my breast removed. I am big busted, so the difference is noticeable. I wasn't offered reconstruction, but don't think I would want it anyway. There is an indentation where the tumour was removed which has never changed and I am almost six years since dx. Hope all goes well with your forthcoming treatment. Best wishes, Christine xx",

      "Content": "Hi Everybody, I have just come across this thread and wanted to say that I finished five years of tamoxifen last September last year with very few side effects. I did experience the hot flushes at the beginning, but they lessened as time went on. There is another brand of tamoxifen your doctor can prescribe which apparently can lessen the sweats. Another method my friend was advised by her doctor was to half the tablet and take one half in the morning and the other at night. Kaz, my doctor advised that tamoxifen has it's optimum effect within two to three years, so I wouldn't worry about that. Advice is changing all the time. My GP advised that at one time everyone was kept on tamoxifen for 10 years then it was realised that that was bringing it's own prroblems so it was reduced to five and now has been realised that like I say the best effects are felt within the two to three year period. Tamoxifen can also increase your risk of endometrial (the lining of the womb) cancer so the less time it is taken the better. I hope this has been of some small help to all of you. Best wishes, Christine xx",

It is activated by filling with water and is much like the memory foam pillows. Once it is activated it is supposed to help keep you cool in bed. You can order them online and they cost around 25 pounds. I think there is also a whole body available. Worth looking into I suppose. Christine xx",

      "Content": "Hi Tessa, thought I would share my experience with you. I didn't have the same drugs as you, but the chemo I had made my hair fall out. I tried the cold cap. There are two types. One of them is hooked up to a machine which cools the scalp and the other (which is the one I was given) was taken straight from the freezer. When this was placed on my head it was horrendous as it was a block of pure ice surrounding my scalp. The headache I experienced was unbelievable and I also panicked, not only because of the pain, but because I felt claustrophobic as the cap is quite tight. I shouted at the nursing staff to remove it, but they convinced me to continue with it. They changed the cap at least another twice. I decided that it was not worth it to continue with the cap. My hair fell out a few days later anyway. I am not telling you this to frighten you, as I know a lot of other people have had different experiences with this. I did not find losing my hair a major problem as I knew it would grow back anyway, and is now down my back as it was before all this. I know that hair loss is a big thing to a lot of women, so I would never tell anybody not to try this. I just wanted to tell you how it was for me. Let me know what you decide and how things go for you. Christine xx",

My hair is away down my back these days, although I am a few years down the line. I think losing our hair serves as a constant reminder to ourselves and others that we are suffering from cancer. You will get through this. I hope you have a much better day tomorrow. Best wishes, Christine xx",

It's a strange feeling, one minute you're getting all this attention, then you're left all alone, so I know what you mean when you say, imagine what it would be like to have this straight away. I can only imagine this must be very scary for your cousin.

I did ask him how he felt about the whole thing, but he would never open up to me and said that he wasn't going to burden me with his feelings as I had enough to cope with and he would never discuss these things with me. I was a bit annoyed about this, but I could understand his feelings, cos that's the type of person he is, quite private. We came through it all quite well. Me moaning, him listening (oh his poor ears) lol. Best wishes to you both for the future. Let us know how things are going. Take care, Christine xx",
