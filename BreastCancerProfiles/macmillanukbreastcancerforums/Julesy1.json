      "Content": "Hi Everyone, Hi youngatheart, I've done no 3 out of 15 today. I decided to go for using the Aveeno after my shower in the end.  I figured that it was 3 hours until treatment.  I hope that it was the right thing! I got the R1 and R2 on prescription from the doctor.  I apply the R1 immediately after. When I got home I applied another thin layer and left it uncovered for 15 minutes.  It made me even later for work, but never mind eh! Good Luck to everyone! Jules xx",

      "Content": "Himaggieme, It definitely makes me wonder with the cream before as it does say not to use R2 before treatment.  I did mention that I had used the Aveeno and my girls said that was fine.  Such conflicting information isn't helpful is it!I I was already suffering with shooting pains prior to starting the radiotherapy, but on Thursday they felt worse and also in a more widespread area.  I just think the Rads may have irritated an existing problem or maybe even paranoia! It's definitely been less of an issue today, so who knows.  Hi Leolady56, I'm only 2 days in at the moment.  I'm using R1 and R2, so haven't used Aloe Vera yet.  I was keeping that in mind for back up.  Yesterday, my skin felt prickly and flushed but it looked normal.  Fingers crossed! It definitely feels better today.   I would really welcome feedback on the R1 and R2 creams as requested in my other post if any one can help? Thank You! Jules xx",

      "Content": "Hello everyone, I didn't want to but I started my rads on Thursday.  I didn't have tattoo's, ive got pen marks instead.  They've also got me a vest to wear during treatment, so at least I still have my dignity. I've managed to get R1 and R2 on prescription, it wasn't easy but I was persistent and got it in the end.  I could do with some advice with the gel/ cream if anyone can help.  I put the R1 gel on straight after treatment on the 1st day and covered it with a cotton hanky.  By the time I got home it was completely stuck to my skin. Yesterday, I did the same but wet the hanky, it was slightly better but still I would be happier if it came away easier.  What has everyone else done?   I am finding that one sachet of the R2 cream isn't really sufficient, and I'm not very big,  how many has everyone else used? I'm concerned that I won't have enough. My appointments are all early, and as you're not supposed to use the R2 cream before treatment, yesterday I put Aveeno on after my shower.  I let them know that I had put cream on and they said that was fine.  Is this ok, or should I not use anything?  I started reacting after my 1st session with shooting pains and yesterday my skin felt really prickly and flushed.  I jeke checking it as I was expecting it to be bright red! Many Thanks Terrified Jules!",

Hope all you lovelies are ok? ️",

All clear margins, not in my lymph nodes and no chemo! Yay!  So now after 13 long weeks i feel like it's time to move on from 'Waiting for Results' I'm now waiting for radiotherapy and the joys of tamoxifen and then getting back to living my life and I'm hoping that,th th will be without change. I'm struggling with body image issues at the moment. I'm hoping that some point in the not too distant future, that will be rectified too. I'm scared about radiotherapy and I'm scared about tamoxifen, so it's all possibly going to get a bit bumpy along the way!",

Whilst I know that it's not all doom and gloom, I realise it's a bit more complicated than having tamoxifen.  I've been moaning like crazy about that, but have come to realise that I'm one of the lucky ones!  Oh jeez, I hope that comes across in the right sentiment! If I've put my foot in it, PLEASE educate me! Hope to chat about stuff! Hugs to you xx",

Yesterday was horrendous, really bad acid, headache, dizzy, pains in legs, rash, I just felt dreadful. I decided to not take last night's tablet and took it this morning instead.  I took the tablet at 10am and by 3pm I was suffering with the headaches again. As the evening is going on, I seem to be developing the pains in my legs again.   I didn't expect to start having symptoms so soon. I really don't know if I can continue if I feel this awful after 3 tablets.  I'm not even on full dose, I've only been taking 10mg. Would love to hear your experiences.. Jules ️",
