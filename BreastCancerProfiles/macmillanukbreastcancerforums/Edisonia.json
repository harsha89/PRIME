    "Content": "I know exactly how you feel I have just completed treatment for Breast Cancer, but whilst I was half way through my radio thereapy my husband twisted his ankle and tore his arciles tendon which means he is in plaster from the knee down, non weight bearing, and this could be for 12 weeks.Â  So my final half of radiotherapy I had to go on my own, which was very upsetting for my husband as he has been very supportive to me even though 20 odd years ago he lost his first wife after breast cancer. We have each other and we will fight on but not a good year so far.",
