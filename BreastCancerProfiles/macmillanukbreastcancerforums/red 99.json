      "Content": "mis use of the chat room could have been managed effectively and easily by blocking those who mis use the function.A guidance on etiquette could have been produced and a set of rules to adhere to. Anyone flouting the rules could have been given one verbal warning and then any further transgression would have resulted in being blocked. Forgive me this is not rocket science and Ive seen this previous update. This situation was completely avoidable if managed effectively",

      "Content": "It is extremely poor that this function has been removed with no explanation and no notice.This is extremely stressful for individuals who are already suffering because of cancer.The immediacy of the chat room was one of its strengths.The public donate the money for this support and this should not have been withdrawn.Lets have a response from a senior manager rather than continually being fobbed off as to what is happening on this",
