    "Content": "Hi Susie. Thanks for posting about this problem. This from a mans perspective. I had my bowel cancer op in January of this year. In March, really 'strange things started happening. My body hair, (arms chest back) started growing to a great extent, my grey hair is turning BLACK in a band around my head, and (when I let my beard start to grow), my 'tash is black as well. I have questioned my surgeon about this, and he replied that this can happen following a major operation, due to hormonal changes. Now as a bloke, this dosent affect me all that much, but I can understand a lady being really upset by this. All I can do is tell people that I'm eating many more bananas these days.......which as it happens, I am. Just wanted to send my support, and maybe offer some words of explanation. I turned down the pre op radiotherapy, and post op chemotherapy, so its not that. Dave xxxx",
