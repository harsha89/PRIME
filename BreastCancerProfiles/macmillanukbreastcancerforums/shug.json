    "Content": "Hello!   I have ILC too.  Have never posted a blog before - just joined this...didn't intend to write anything, then saw your message and thought I should reply!....you poor thing, but at least the Drs are on the case now.  I have not had surgery yet - have been having chemo first, which is horrible, but works.  I often wish I had just had surgery straight away in July when diagnosed, as the waiting and chemo seems interminable, and I have a great sense of wanting to get rid!! I have 2 children, am 45, and my mum in law just died of breast cancer a week before Christmas!  But all circumstances are different; treatment is good, and all my contact with the NHS has been absolutely excellent.  Have met lots of great people.  Cancer is so prevalent these days, thanks to good diagnosis.  The shock is the worst, then you get used to it gradually - just have to cope with everyone else's shock for a few weeks/months!!  Of course you will be scared, but you are in good hands.  Sending you lots of positive thoughts, Lots of love, shug",
