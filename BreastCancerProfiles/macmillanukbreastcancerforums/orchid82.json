      "Content": "Hi R Thank you very much for the prompt response.  To be honest I haven\u2019t got any decisions regarding the surgery yet that\u2019s why I am panicking a little bit. I like to have a plan.  At the moment I am taking paracetamol and codeine and barely helps with the pain, this is why I am concerned what is going to be like when they actually cut me open.  Thanks ",

It cannot be worse than chemo or being in the hospital with the temperature which happened twice so far and I must say A&E was the worst experience I have ever had.  All the best to you  ",

      "Content": "Hello everyone  I am on the 5th cycle of FEC and side effects are just awful. One more to go and then the surgery which I know nothing about.  My lump has shrank half of the size so that's good news but still the unknown is very frustrating. During the surgery they will remove my lymph nodes also so a bit scared of pain. The pain is my main concern.. At the moment not dealing with it too good. Any advice regarding the surgery would be appreciated. Thank you ",
