      "Content": "Thank you Mrs Beezley for taking the time to reply.  I haven't got an oncologist as such - just locums :( I am seeing the nurse on Monday for blood tests prior to my chemo on Wednesday.  I shall raise the issue with her.  I'm putting sodocream on it at the moment to see if that helps.  In some respects it's nice to know it's not just me, but it is a horrible reaction as it is so sore and I am sorry in other ways to hear others have also suffered.  I can appreciate changing treatment and having neutropenia must have got you down.  I am so pleased that is behind you now adn hope you are now on the mend.  xx",

      "Content": "Following mastectomy and implant, my 'underboob' has been v sore and v red. I now have a rash there as well. I've been told the redness is where the skin is so thin and that where the muscle wall was cut. But to now have a rash is a worry. The bcn said the rash is probably where the bra has rubbed but why after all this time? Anyone had similar experience. I've been on antibiotics for over a week. ",

      "Content": "Hi I've had 3 Fec, and 1 Docetaxel.  I have 2 sessions of Docetaxel left.   I didn't feel as sick on Docetaxel, but did feel like I'd been run over by a bus by day 3 up to about day 8.  On day 9 my face became red/blotchy and feels like I've been burnt especially on my cheeks, eye lids and under eyes, down my neck also.   I'm now on day 18.  My red skin feels tight and itchy and is starting to crack. It is bright red.  I'm using calamine lotion to cool it down.   I have my next Docetael scheduled for next Wednesday.  If I am experiencing this now, what the heck will another blast do?  I do not have an oncologist assigned as mine left at the start of my treatment and so I see locums or the nurse.  Has anyone out there had experience of this 'burn' and did anything help?  My GP prescribed me high dose antihistamines, but they've had no effect to date. Best wishes to all - CJo",

      "Content": "Thank you Crstaljuju for taking the time to reply.  The Chemo nurses said it was a rare reaction and told me to see my GP - who prescribed antihistamines. I've tried some moisturisers since the reaction flared up, but they sting like mad - I'm using sodocream now. My temp is normal thanks, although 4 days after docetaxel I ended up in hospital after fainting several times - had antibiotics pumped in and was let out after 4 days.  I thought Fec was bad, but it appears to have nothing on docetaxel! xx",
