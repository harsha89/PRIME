    "Content": "Hi Lesley I too have spots (and plan to visit my GP as Tess suggested).  Thanks to Tamoxifen, comfort eating and Christmas (I was diagnosed last November, op. in December, radiotherapy in January) I have put on nearly a stone!  In the past when I had to loose one and a half stone, my GP advised me to continue eating whatever I enjoy + apples (!) but to leave about a third of my portion on the plate.  This is what I'm doing now hopping that I will loose the extra pounds soon.  OK, nothing like the 2 stone you put on.................................. The good news is that with the wheather improving, I (we?) should be able to go for brisk walks during the long evenings!  Fighting spots and weight with you! All the best - Georgia  ",
