      "Content": "Hello - I have just joined the site and realise I sent my post to the wrong section this morning.  Here it is again: Hi there - this is my first post and I'm wishing I'd found you sooner!  I had my first cycle of FEC 75 for breast cancer 2½ weeks ago, on January 12th.  Before that, both the oncologist and the senior nurse told me there was no point in scalp cooling because my hair was going to fall out anyway, because of the strength of the regime.  Then, on the day of the first treatment, as I was signing the consent form the oncologist suggested trying the cooling for 10 minutes as my hair might not fall out (....?).  So I went down to the chemo area and told the nurse, a different one this time, who reiterated that it wasn't worth trying it.  Since I was getting the same message twice from the people who see patients all the time, and I assumed they wouldn't contradict the doctor (why did I assume that!), I went along with it.  However, when the oncologist came down about halfway through, he didn't look too pleased when I reported this to him.  He told me later that he'd spoken to the nurse and that with my \"history\" of headaches (I get more than normal but nothing excessive, and no migraines) I probably wouldn't have been able to tolerate it.  My reading of this is that he gave the nurse a telling off but gave me a cover story. Two weeks, to the day, after Cycle 1 (ie Wednesday 26th), my hair started falling out.  It seems kind of loose all over - I can just pull a hair lightly and it will come out (the novelty value of that waned after about 10 seconds!), and there are always hairs hanging off the ends ready to drop off etc.  The prospect of losing my hair - never my crowning glory - didn't bother me too much if it was inevitable, but now I am not very happy about the advice I was given, especially having just read other posts on this forum where the cooling has been successful on the same regime as mine.  Also, I'm being treated at a centre where they don't seem to be particularly short of time, so I don't think it's an issue of the nurses not wanting to take the trouble, which is something I've read can be an issue. So my question is: is it worth it at all to try the scalp cooler for Cycle 2 this Wednesday (2nd Feb)?  My feeling is that it isn't, as the damage has already been done, but I would welcome any advice or comments in advance of my wig appointments tomorrow.  The loss isn't visible yet so there's still time to arrange one to match my hair - so it's not all bad news! Thanks. Sally    ",

      "Content": "Hi again and thank you so much for all your replies - and so quickly too.  It is as I suspected, then, which is that I should have been given the chance to try the cold cap and it's too late now.  But that it might not have worked, or I might not have been able to tolerate the discomfort.  I will tell myself that's probably what would have happened.  It's very reassuring to hear everyone's experiences and opinions, because before I found this site I couldn't find anything specific on the internet.  Max - having coloured my hair for many years, I never thought with all this about getting the opportunity to start again with undamaged hair.  That's a really good way of looking at it.  Thank you again.

      "Content": "Hi Just as a follow up, not using the cold cap on the first treatment definitely put paid to any chances of the hair staying - it would have been pointless to try the cold cap for the second chemo.  It's about 70% gone now.  If you are interested, I just posted something in the Practical Issues forum about a charity who will come to you and help you with 'non-wig' headwear if you need it.   Best wishes, Rosalind (thought I was supposed to sign off with my username)    ",

      "Content": "Hi Margaret   I can see that if you know your hair will fall out anyway eventually, you'd think why go through the discomfort just to prolong the inevitable.  But from others on this site my impression is that the cold cap can be pretty successful with FEC 75, and I just felt I was given contradictory information and then sent in the wrong direction.  Fortunately, you were properly advised.  I have not heard of TAC but from what you say it must be quite a bit stronger than FEC 75.  It's good to know you are happy with your new hair.  That is one huge benefit.  The support from you and others is fantastic and I hope I can do the same later on.  Rosalind x  ",
