    "Content": "Hi Lellis, Our situation is a wee (big) bit different from your in that my husband was Stage4 at diagnosis. He was seen by a Private Consultant 24 hours after my husbands blood tests came back from the GP - and had an endoscopy, colonoscopy  and CT scan within a week (would have been quicker if he hadn't started taking the iron tablets the GP prescribed) We saw a surgeon (who gave us the bad news -that it was treatable but not curable) and an Oncologist within 5 days of the scan. I asked the oncologist what the \"difference\" would be between private and NHS treatment - and the main difference was that \"biological therapies\" for colon cancer were available privately that were not available from NHS in Scotland - he also said \"The nurses will know who you are when you phone\" So that's why we went down the \"private\" road. However, my husband has had some very serious \"complications\" with his treatment and the private sector is really not set up to deal with emergencies and we are \"coming and going\" in and out of the NHS and Private and sometimes it feels like we are between a rock and a hard place. The nurses in the private sector were not helpful and when there was any symptom that was not necessarily immediately linked to the chemotherapy - they were \"useless\" (IMHO) so generally I was \"not impressed\" with them... When we get involved with the NHS as we have had to ecause of the complications - I have to go through his \"medical history\" every single time we speak to someone \"different\" as we don't have a single \"point of contact\" - and the medical records are not centralised. It didn't help that we had sold our house and had to change GP's when he was diagnosed either :( and it feels like there is no \"continuity of care\" - I was asked by one consultant \"Who is you husbands clinician?\" - Well, he doesn't have one so that would be ME then!! So, Private is good for : Quick - Procedures,Scans and results- nice food,comfy room, convenient appointments and edible food. Private is not good for: Anything that is an emergency or not directly linked to Chemo. Since we got \"involved\" with the NHS - We now have: 1) District Nurse 2) Palliative Care Nurse 3) Occupational Therapist (she's fab!) 4) Dietician So they each have their good and bad points. So, after that tale of woe... IF i were you - I'd use the Private care but I would -without doubt- keep in very close contact with your GP and he/she can \"make sure\" that you get the \"other\" support that is available from the NHS. I would also recommend finding out if there is something like a Maggies Centre in your area - my husband is too ill to make use of it - but they do have some wonderful people who offer great support. Best of luck with your treatment.   Jinty XX                              ",
