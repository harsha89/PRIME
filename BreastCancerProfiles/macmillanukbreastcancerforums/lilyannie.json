      "Content": "Hi I had ANC and lumpectomy 3 weeks ago tomorrow. I'm back at the hospital on Wednesday to find out my next steps. However although I'm doing my exercises I find that my arm is slighly swollen but my back is more so (area where bra fits and bra strap is). I've been wearing a bra as instructed but find that by the evening my skin feels very sensitive even though everything is numb at the moment. (Because it feels stretched I find the exercises more difficult in the evening)  I just wondered if anyone else has had a similar experience. Obviously I will ask on Wednesday but worried that something is not quite right,",
