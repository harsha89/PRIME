      "Content": "Really sorry that chemo has left you with such awful symptoms. I also had pain during chemo. It split into different area 1. Bone pain from the Filgrastim injections 2. Hand and foot Peripheral Neuropathy - numbness, a strange deep almost vibrating pain-like sensation, pins and needles, electric shocks 3. Pain which radiated from my spine and down hands and legs. I had a road traffic accident and it felt as if chemo flared up the pain from this somehow. I've also been left very physically weak, fatigued and with no stamina. Still using a wheelchair outside my home. It's only been around 6 weeks since my last T and I've also had surgery. I think my symptoms are getting better (others are getting worse i.e. lost toe nails and painful teeth) I've added magnesium, potassium and ALA (plus carntine)  tablets to my daily intake. I've still got some residual nausea and vomiting after chemo so I can't add extra food right now.  Also have been taking Claritine since the Fligramstim injections because they can cause histamine release. This can cause pain. The scenario your consultant is describing sounds like osteoarthritis because the estrogen has dropped. I'm not sure if this is a complete explanation for your symptoms. If it was this quick, wouldn't we have more ladies with OE reporting it so soon after chemo? Sorry it's not an area I know much about. Has any testing been carried out to confirm the OA or look for other reasons for the pain you are in? If  it's a no and if I was in your position I'd be asking for a referral to help and determine  what is causing the symptoms. I'd personally not rule out a form of PN contributing to some of this and there are supplements to try if you want to. Hope this helps. ",

We talked through all the options and the POSNOC trial. I wouldn't be able to enter the trial though as I've already had chemo to shrink the lump. Took away the answers to my questions and I have decided to have a sentinel node biopsy with my lumpectomy. They don't have the facilities sadly to test on-site so the biopsy will need to be sent away and there will be the usual 2/3 week wait to see if clear. Before the 23rd I'll need to go to another hospital for some blue dye to be injected. Another thing my hospital doesn't do. I'm quite relieved to have made that decision.  Nervous though - of course!",

      "Content": "Hi to everyone approaching surgery and the ladies with experience of surgery, I had the appointment with my surgeon this week. When I originally met with him the plan was to do chemo, then a lumpectomy if it had shrunk enough and the rads. I would also continue with Herceptin. The good news is that the chemo had worked magic on the lump. It has shrunk from over 3cm to under 1cm and was breaking up. I've got one more chemo to go. Hurray!!! I'm not sure what to do about my lymph glands. The surgeon wants to take out level 1 and 2 at the same time as the lump. I would not normally question this, it is routine for them, but I \"only\" had 1 affected lymph glands and more importantly I already have Lymphodema and Lipodema. In addition I have a neurological and other diseases. The Oncologist (and other doctor I spoke to at the clinic) are of the impression that I have some lee-way to make a decision as the chemo results are so good and I am going to have rads anyway. Anyone else faced this decision?",

Have a think as well about any other medical conditions you have that could get worse. Plain ahead and freeze some meals and stock in anything you may need My experience of chemo was very bad and I was so so breathless, weak and sick that I was unable to use a computer or make telephone calls for long periods. Was also admitted to hospital. If your daughter and husband are warned upfront what can happen then it won't be such a shock if it does. I know that this may worry and distress them but at least talking through the worst possible scenario can hopefully make things easier. Maybe let you daughter know how to call the GP and give her the details of your breast care nurse and oncologist and how to reach your husband if needed. Your husband may need to let his company know what is happening and if there is an emergency that he may need to return home. If you have any family who could come and stay with you that could also be an idea. Don't know what chemo regime you are on. For me week 1 was the worst for side effects like sickness (and that can include uncontrollable vomiting), week 2 was when I was vulnerable for infections and that when hospital stays may be needed. Week 3 is sometimes called the recovery week but it wasn't for me. I had to change to a 4 weekly cycle and reduce drugs. Hope that helps. Not meaning to frighten you as most people get by OK. ",

      "Content": "I've not examined all of the claims about breast cancer and alcohol. Personally I don't take much interest in what an article in a magazine or newspaper would say on any given health issue and instead I look for published research that would give me a better picture. Since my own diagnosis I've simply not had the time to read the most recent published papers on risk factors and see the strength of relevance for any given factor. Hopefully in the future I will get a chance to do this. That aside, I'm not surprised that your sister starting drinking heavily after her BC diagnosis. It would have been a huge shock. I've had family members who had previously given up smoking start again when faced with terrible life events. Your sister is facing several whammy's of horribleness. First of all she has breast cancer, then she starts drinking again after being sober for month, then she faces chemo (something I never want to ever do again), then she has the extra potential \"blame\" on top that her drinking has lead her to the breast cancer and so on. She may be beating herself up and dealing with it through drinking.  Chemo was so bad for me I'd easily have lapsed into previous bad behaviour.  If drinking would have made me feel better I would have welcomed it.  I can only imagine the damage being done through all these chemo drugs and alcohol to her liver. My liver hasn't recovered and I'm 6 months past chemo. The focus right now needs to be helping her to survive chemo and cancer maybe? I was hospitalised on my chemo cycles with infections until I refused to go near them again. I didn't take my medicine as I discovered that some of the drugs were making my symptoms worse (i.e. dizzyness, weakness) and my consultant insisted I take a steroid for one cycle that I had previous reacted badly to. My advice would be to give your support to your sister for her chemo treatment and see if anything could be done to help her get through this without any blame for either her current drinking or the idea that her drinking led to the breast cancer. Have you taken any advice from her doctors as to the effect her current drinking is having on the effectiveness of her chemo drugs to shrink or eradicate the cancer?  If so, are there alternative cancer treatments available to her that could cope with her possible non-compliance to chemo? Then when she has got through chemo and survived her breast cancer offer to fund any treatment of choice for her addiction that she chooses. Just a few ideas. Hope this ramble is of some help to you and your sister.",

To cut a long story short the hospital has kept going on as if I was having a total node clearance and I've had a number of phone calls and one meeting (with the surgeons nurse) that say this. I have to keep correcting them. Yesterday I had a very patronising call from the BC nurse to see \"if maybe I was making the right decision and had thought through the consequences\". Well, if I was in doubt I would talk to the surgeon (have rapport) and not her. I tried to talk to them about the POSNOC study a few weeks ago and they were disinterested (to say the least). My surgery is on Friday and I need to have a dye injection tomorrow. I didn't need all this hassle from them at the last minute. If I hadn't chased the dye injection appointment this would not have happened.  One secretary told me she sent them the paperwork, another tells me that there was no paperwork sent because \"I didn't need it\".

      "Content": "Judy, That's great news about your migraines. I wonder if this could possibly point to an auto-immune cause for them or some B-cell involvement? The reason I am mentioning this is that there seems to be a growing number of conditions which are reported as getting better with chemo. I think that these are mainly anecdontal but some research is being carried out. I've not heard of this with migraines before but it is not an area I have looked at.  The working theory about some conditions improving on Chemo seems to be based around B-cell or antibody depletion. Chemo as you know wipes out white blood cells. I have a neurological disease and the same effect (i.e. the disease going into remission) is also being reported with some chemos. The side effects of chemo have been so severe for me so far that I wouldn't notice. I do have one friend with the same neurological disease who went into remission for 8 months after her chemo. Then she relapsed. She's never had a remission before so it was significant.  Her doctors are trying to work out exactly what happens and how long it takes types of B cells and antibodies to regenerate and what else happens to the immune system. If you have a consultant who you see about your migraines maybe mention it to them? My brother-in-law suffers badly and having seen it  I can totally sympathise on how bad it can be.",

One way of thinking about it is that it is an exploratory biopsy. We don't know what the true situation is they cut us open and we have the results from the lab.  For some lucky people that is it.  Not surprised you had a bad night. It's another uncertain operation but hopefully the last one for you and then the rest of your life to look forward to and plan.",

I met with my surgeon and then decided that i would have the sentinel node biopsy at the same time as my lumpectomy. Taking this gamble as the result I had from chemo was so good. My hospital can't do the lymph node test though so the sample will need to go to another hospital for testing and it will be 2/3 weeks before I know the result. My operation will be either later this week or next week. There has been a complication in that I started with one surgeon, had my next meeting with someone different but had to go back to the first surgeon again to talk through the options (as the 2nd was on holiday). Surgeon 2 doesn't seem to have read my notes as I got a call from their secretary trying to schedule me for a node clearance ANC instead of a SNB.",

I'd had seriously bad vibes from the breast cancer nurse and previous conversation.  The surgeon bounded in and said that there wasn't very much to report. I was all geared up for bad news and another operation but it was not to be. The tumour was removed with clear margins and my lymph nodes were clear. I won't need a mastectomy after all.  The lump was in a tricky place so I could not have had a second lumpectomy. Although it's left the breast floppy she doesn't look too bad and the nerves etc to my arm seem to be recovering from the operation. Big PHEW! That's part 2 of my triathlon nearly over. The large wound under my arm is sore and red. If it doesn't go down in a couple of days I need to return for someone to drain it. 2nd appointment was with my Oncologist. Stay on the Herceptin, referral done for rads, after rads hormone tablets. Lots more research to do now. My oncologist said I could \"have some time to recover now and feel like a normal person\" @CathyPJ, thinking of you, hope the pre-surgery appointment went well and everything crossed for you on Monday!",

A great response. The original lump has shrunk and is barely there now. However, I'm in a slightly different boat as the original biopsy (after first mammogram) showed that the cancer had spread to the lymph glands. I don't know now what the status is of the cancer is now in my lymph nodes after chemo.  I've been reading the medical journals and published papers on this topic. It's very controversial and even doctors don't agree. there seems to be a divide between the USA and the UK.  In 2011 USA published a study comparing woman who had a total node clearance to those who didn't. The results from this study were reported as good so the American Oncologist's changed their guidelines so that for a group of woman there was no automatic node clearance.  However, here in the UK the NICE guidelines have not been changed. There is a study running at the moment that is looking at the same question (as the USA) one but it is a 10 year study and no results as yet. I think from memory that in the USA study involvement of 1 or 2 lymph nodes didn't mean an automatic removal of all (but I need to check this). Chemo brain at the moment. This is a big topic and I am not doing it justice here. We are in a different position in that you won't know if there is node involvement until your operation and you have not had chemo yet I think? Obviously even if you have node involvement on biopsy,  the chemo or the rads after your op may deal with that. It may be if you talk to your surgeon they may offer something like a biopsy before surgery or another idea. Also talk you through the options after surgery. Hope this ramble makes some sense. I can quite understand why you would be asking these questions. ",

Wiped out and could barely stand.  Now healing. When I did look I was surprised to see such a large horizontal wound under my armpit and quite high up. There's another one lower down and more towards the breast. Then the cuts to the actual breast. Something that came back to me from after the operation when the surgeon came to see me was that they said they had to take more lymph nodes out than they expected. I was totally groggy after the operation and not able to take it all in or have a conversation. I'm wondering now exactly what it is that they have done. Unfortunately I don't have an appointment with them for 2 weeks. The BC nurse phoned yesterday and said my results were delayed.  Not stressing out or anything. Just curious.",

      "Content": "Dear Jacki, You deserve a medal for even thinking of going to work!! My Chemo treatment (FEC-T) left me often bed-bound, violently sick, incontinent and unable to bath for the first cycles. It was cumulative as well with each one on top of the symptoms which never resolved by week 3. In the end I had to change to a 4 weekly cycle and get some serious anti-sickness meds. Also a reduction in the dose.  Ended up in hospital with an infection on the first cycle and then had infections on the further 2 (but refused hospital and got GP to treat). That was the FEC part When we go to the T I asked for a reduction in dose from the start. Fortunately, for me it wasn't as bad as FEC  but there was no way I could have worked. Maybe from home on week 3 a little. I am gobsmacked that anyone at your work expected you to be there during chemo. It is true some people sail through chemo but for the rest of us it can be a rocky week or three. Did your crash on Sunday coincide with anything - was it the end of the steroids? Some people react badly to stopping the steroids with tearfulness. I was very emotional on one week of treatment. For my cycles I ended up on a very low dose of steroids for the whole month. I react badly to Dexamethosome so used Predislone instead. I also had a bad reaction to one of the anti-sickness meds,  Please don't give up hope. Your chemo dose can be lowered or changed to another drug. Your steroids can be changed. You may need to be firm with the team treating you. Mine was useless when it came to side effect help and I had to make a complaint in the end. Others have wonderful breast care nurses. Once I made my complaint things fell into place. ",

It has been months of largely being either bedbound or housebound. If I could go back in time I was use the pre-chemo time to get my affairs in order and learn as much as I could about the process. As an example I have only just finished reading \"breast book\" by Dr Susan Love and I just wish I could have done this before. When I did have chemo I was so weak and sick I couldn't lift my head from the pillow or use a computer. I needed to do things in advance I know now) like put together an over-night bag for hospital and to sorting out what to do about the hair loss and other side effects. I was lucky to have a spare bucket to throw up into as it became my best friend. If chemo is the ordeal for you that it was for me, you could look back at this time with almost envy. I have no idea now, for example how I am going to cope with Xmas as I now have surgery to look forward to. It can be one big long assembly line of challenges and unexpected events. Seriously, though if it would help maybe be pro-active, ring them and explain that you would feel better with a date.  Good luck!",

After one operation I remember going from the theater home and then out  to a party that night. The crash after this was truly terrible. For my lumpectomy I asked for no adrenaline to be used and I brought in some guidelines for a medical condition I have. So glad I did this as, although I came out of the operation in great pain, I didn't have the horrible fake high and the crash afterwards. For the three weeks after the operation I did the exercises given to me in a booklet and rested the arm. It all went very well. I then got over confident and began to use it normally and developed cording in that arm.   I've no way of knowing what is happening in your body. It may be that you are one of those lucky people who bounds through operations and has not complications afterwards - hope so anyway!",

      "Content": "Hi Anstri, One of the tenants of the NHS is that patients must give an informed consent on any treatment. You shouldn't be railroaded into anything that you don't understand and all the risks and alternatives should be explained to you. The final choice should be yours. For me, reading your post, the big question is why chemo before surgery is out? It may be that they ran tests on the past biopsies and determined that this wouldn't work.  This is something you should be told though.  You can't in practice agree to a mastectomy without knowing why you can't get a lumpectomy. The size of the tumour isn't enough of a reason in all cases. My experience was that I had a large and fast growing tumour in a hard to get to place - and all on small breasts. Biopsies of my lymph nodes during my initial examinations showed cancer. We agreed on chemo to shrink the lump, then to try for a lumpectomy. This worked well for me and during the operation I asked them to biopsy my lymph nodes again instead of removing them. There was no cancer and my lump had shrunk to barely nothing. That was my decision which I determined after considering the alternatives. The downside was that the chemo was so grueling I am still trying to recover as the side effects were for me, long and severe. Some people, my Oncologist said, wanted an operation before chemo. They would rather have the lump removed even if that means a mastectomy rather than waiting to see if a lumpectomy is possible. For some people it's just not an alternative though. None of us know what the future will bring when cancer treatment starts. Any of the procedures we have could bring minor or major problems. That's why we need to give our informed consent to this. Once something is done we can't look back in regret and wish it undone. There shouldn't be any surprises we don't know about. However, with cancer treatment doctors need to use a process to give the alternatives to us. They do however, have an obligation to explain this.  I found with treatment that the decisions went on and on. When I started chemo I didn't know for 8 months if it would work and shrink the lump. Then I didn't know if the cancer was still in my lymph nodes. Some women go through all of this, then they still need a mastectomy. It should be our choice though. My breast cancer nurse was useless but you may have a good one. My Oncologist's secretary was also useful. When I had surgery I went back and spoke it through twice before I consented to the operation. Some patients don't want to be closely involved with decisions. I have a friend going though treatment now who doesn't want to read about it or question her doctors. I found the whole process overwhelming and there was a long and continual learning curve. Hope this helps.",

Hopefully someone knows if there is a 21 day break before you start the weekly T part.

Against that, is delaying treatment, the risk of infection occurring and stopping travel and any risks associated with travel ( is it by air and is the any increased risk of blood clots or more infections?).  Can well understand how this feels like a lifetime and how important a holiday is. I've not finished Herceptin yet, full range of side effects from this and chemo and it's another summer spent like this.  ",

It looks like from a short read of the topic that they are repeating the methods of the USA ZO011 trial published in 2011 to see if they get the same outcome in UK patients. This is the conclusion from that trial. \"Conclusion Among patients with limited SLN metastatic breast cancer treated with breast conservation and systemic therapy, the use of SLND alone compared with ALND did not result in inferior survival.\" jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx This does seem to be a hugely controversial topic in the medical journals and especially between the UK and the USA \"Although the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)[12] still recommends ANC for patients with axillary lymph node-positive breast cancer, American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines[13] state that patients with one or two positive nodes undergoing breast-conserving surgery and whole-breast radiotherapy, who fulfil Z0011 entry criteria, do not require routine ANC.\" http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bjs.9952/full",

      "Content": "I'm not surprised you are angry. My clinic and in particular the breast care nurses were utter rubbish and I also ended up in hospital with an infection and had a severe reaction to chemo. Not listened to all through the process and left mainly to try and work for solutions myself and outside the hospital. Was also angry about how I was treated so really sympathise.  Now you have been left with what sounds like a mutilation and you have been through a tremendous ordeal. They got this badly, badly wrong at so many different stages.  Keep a record of everything that you can. Make sure you have notes of what happened and when now when it is fresh in your mind. Write down dates, times and who you speak with.  You've fought hard to get proper treatment and it's going to be hard to deal with all this. The error on error compounding more and more. What would you like to do now and what physically can you cope with though? All of this may have left you with an exhausted body and mind. Is there anything more than can be done now or is it a case of waiting for the wound to heal and rest so that you can fight the next stage of this battle? In my case I made a formal complaint to PALS and this went to the Head of Cancer Services. Because so much has happened they may try to treat you at arms length now or they could be very useful. If I was in your position I'd make a plan. Get the information I need together and decide what to do and when. It sounds like you need an answer on the current scar. If I had the money and physical strength I'd make an appointment to see another surgeon at another NHS hospital or as a private appointment. Either that or see if there is someone at MacMillian who knows about surgery who can advise you. The rest of this mess they have created can wait until your health picks up I hope. It may be that you do need to wait until you are able to deal with the scar or until it is healed because of the risk of infection. Really really sorry that this has happened. We don't actually know in many ways how good our surgeons and clinics are until something goes wrong and they have let you down so badly. I was given the choice of seeing another consultant or moving to another hospital. That may be useful in the future but you probably want to find out what you can do now and how?",

Most of these drinks are also good for my nausea. 1. Flavoured milk drinks. The ones that come in big cartons from the milk section of the supermarket. Belgium chocolate or banana only (I hate milk (and milk drinks) so this is different for me than normal) 2. Fresh orange juice. As fresh as possible. The stuff that comes as a concentrate or in cartons is a no-no for me as tastes \"decayed\". I've done OK with the stuff in plastic bottles from supermarkets. 3. A squeeze of lemon in water 4. Sweet \"citrus flavoured drinks\". Oasis as an example. Normally too sickly sweet but at the moment heaven. 5. ginger beer (to a lesser extent as it now stings as it goes down and I am pretty sick of ginger now) 6. green tea (to a lesser extent and I have only had it hot and wonder if cold would also taste OKsih?) 7. Fresh watermelon. Hope this helps. ",

      "Content": "Not surprised you are fed up Tilly, I've been trying to weigh up the alternatives of a SNB and Axillary clearance. Only read about the Metasin testing today in a NICE Guideline on treatment. I gather that there are different types of testing for the SNB and it's not an exact science. Sorry this is all new to me This snippet here \"The RD-100i OSNA system and Metasin test are designed to show whether cancer cells have spread from the breast to lymph nodes in the armpits of people diagnosed with invasive breast cancer. During surgery to remove a breast tumour, they are carried out to help the surgeon decide at the time (rather than having to wait for laboratory results) whether the lymph nodes need to be removed as well. This can avoid the need for a second operation, and also allow treatments such as chemotherapy to be started earlier. NICE recommends the RD-100i OSNA system as an option for detecting cancer cells in armpit lymph nodes during breast surgery in people with early invasive breast cancer. Although the Metasin test shows promise, NICE does not recommend it for use in routine clinical NHS practice, and recommends that more evidence for the test is needed.\" https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/dg8",

      "Content": "Hi 4PAWS, Sometimes we need to complain loudly to be heard. It shouldn't be like this but some clinics have crap individual staff members and it sounds as if you have met one of these.  My experience was dire. Had vomiting and nausea all through FEC and when I started Doxetacel my Oncologist claimed that this was stop. Of course it didn't. I couldn't even get through the first infusion. The staff were hopeless and my breast care nurse \"didn't do chemo\". Later when I looked it up Doxetaxel was lower in the % of sickness side effects but it was still there for some people (maybe 10%?) There is no reason why you should be left to suffer like this. There are at least 6 different physical pathways in the body to try and control nausea and vomiting. You may need drugs from more than one area to get this under control. I ended up on around 4 to make a dent in the problem. What I had to do was complain loudly and then again. I spoke to PALS at the hospital and said I needed help. I also rang my Oncologist's Secretary and asked for help urgently. I rang my GP. This sounds like it was easy but given that the side effects were so severe that I couldn't lift my head from the pillow, in all took weeks to do. For the pain I came across an old medical paper on anti-histamines and pain in chemo. I added Claritine and Benedryl to the drugs I was taking. If you can get it the COx2 inhibitor Celebrex helped me. If you can't get to talk to anyone tonight is there an emergency number for your clinic (mine had a bleeper) or can you call out your GP?  In my case the motion sickness drug Cyclizine was the first that made a small difference and I was able to buy some from Boots. I've never had motion sickness before (was a good sailor) but now get it even in a car.  You may find that you need a completely different combo of drugs. One of the drugs I was given metoclopramide was a disaster and had it's own set of side effects.  With the horrible taste in my mouth I found citrus was a friend. Freshly squeezed OJ, squirt of lemon in water and ginger drinks if I could tolerate them.  I drank milky drinks from the supermarket (i.e. chocolate or banana mllk) which was bizarre as I hate them normally. Fruit smoothies - sometimes the tart ones and sometime sweet like strawberry. Couldn't tolerate pineapple but yes to fresh grapes. With regards to the high temperature is there any chance it could be an infection? I was told to get to A&E and given a card to show them at the first sign of a high temp. I ended up with infections on all three of my FEC's. Good luck!",

Hopefully they should be able to map out a treatment regime for you as post-surgery and with test results (i.e. the ER and HER2) When I first saw my Oncologist my test results were not available (and I was having Chemo first) so it was a case of \"we will probably do this but if this test is possible maybe this instead\" My Oncologist wrote a quick plan with me on paper with some alternatives / time line and this was valuable as an aide memoire afterwards. Maybe bring paper and sketch one with them? She also gave me some printouts of the Chemo regime from the internet. Hopefully others will know more as I've not been in your exact position.

Once before when receiving a copy letter to my GP I had to write and correct the overly cheery picture given in it. Seems to be a pattern of not-acknowledging side effects or difficulties to my GP. Your advice about the easiest option was very good. I'm hopefully at the end of my time under the Oncologist and not the start. For that reason I've decided not to change to another Oncologist unless there is a complete breakdown with this one.  I've decided to write, correct the errors and ask for another appointment. I've also written a list of my physical symptoms and asked for that to be placed on my medical record. Going to talk it over with my GP as well. Thanks for the reply and the great advice. ",

Only one more to go and then on to surgery and rads (and Herceptin). I was totally floored by the FEC's but the T's have been a little easier. It's a funny old world! This could be because I was so bad on the FEC's (like yourself into hospital) that I asked my Oncologist before I started the T for a reduced dose. I've still been pretty bad. Did they give you the Filgrastim injections to do at home? I got infections on all 3 FEC's but since I started the T's I've not had one as yet (touch wood). I'm wondering if it is the GCFS injections at home that are doing the trick?",

Your partner not having seen an accountant for 2 years I am guessing is stopping his earnings from being assessed to see what you can get. PIP is one benefit that isn't means tested. You don't need to have paid national insurance to get that (unless you have just come to the UK of course).

      "Content": "I don't know if this post will make much sense but I am distressed and would appreciate a shoulder to cry on. As some of you may know I suffered severe side effects from Chemo (FEC-T, then Herceptin). The side effects were so bad that I had to change from a 3 weekly to a 4 weekly cycle and had to insist on a lower dose of drugs. It was a battle for me all through chemo as I had to fight problems with my clinic and the treatment regime and no one took my side effects seriously until I had made 2 formal complaints and it was far too late.  I had to drive my own treatment with little support.  To add to this I already have a pre-existing medical condition (a neurological disease) and this flared up badly through treatment, then I have old injuries from a road traffic accident. My body seemed to go into an allergic, inflammatory state would be my working theory. My neurologist agrees.  Now, 2 months after finally finishing Herceptin I am much worse off physically than when I started. I can't work, drive a car or leave my home for other than short appointments. I've been quite calm about this. Delighted as well because although the cancer treatment was grueling I survived and it was very successful. Thought it was \"just\" a question of being patient and getting what help I could with side effects and resting to recover from a physical and mental ordeal.  Then something happened I saw my Oncologist and she sent a letter about the appointment to my GP, No mention of the side effects or anything resembling the appointment. Apparently I am returning to my old self and am able to exercise (something she wants me to do). Nothing could be further from the truth. It would be a miracle if I could exercise (as it is causing severe symptoms if I do) and this is very damaging misinformation that is now on my medical file.  Everything came crashing down on me when I saw that letter. After the appointment with her that day I had been so weak I could only crawl on my hands and knees up the stairs to my home. Then  I came down with a bad flu and a sinus infection. My immunity appears to be very low. What I did was to make an appointment to see someone at my local MacMillan centre  (when I could move again) as emotionally and physically I felt devastated. I wanted to talk it through.  Need to decide what to do now. .I can make an appointment and talk it through with my consultant, see a colleague, ask to be sent to another hospital, make a formal complaint. Some of this is not really practical. I can't physically travel to another hospital. I can't even get to see my normal neurologist. I feel all \"complaint'ed\" out. There is only 1 other Oncologist. Anyone else been in the same position? My objective is to get an accurate description of my physical state on-file, get this one removed, get what investigations & treatment I can get for side effects, rest and recover. All all from a position of barely being able to leave my home and very limited in brain power / letter writing power / limited ability to talk or use a phone. Obvious conflicts here..",

What I did was to get the dose reduced (which I see your doctor is doing) and I also changed my cycle to a 4 weekly one as I wasn't recovering on week 3. Also I got my GP involved and was treated at home instead of going into hospital on each one.  I hate the way \"stress and anxiety\" is used as an excuse when we have these side effects. Fortunately for me they didn't or should I say fortunately for them... There are other drugs that can be used in chemo and other ways of doing the cycle so talk to your consultant if your body cannot cope. I \"braved\" myself through it and felt very positive but now all these months later I've still got many of the side effects and the drugs seem to have had a longer term effect on my body. As an example (just a simple one) I'm still losing my nails).",

Did get a shock at the size and length of it. My lump has shrunk so much it was hard to find, needed another Mammogram and a lot of fluffing around Met with the Anesthetist in the ward, then the Surgeon Into surgery around 12 noon. No blue dye for me as a bit allergic to things Back into the Ward from the recovery room around 2pm Headed home around 6pm as too weak to walk after the operation and in too much pain All went very well. I had to wait 2-3 weeks to hear that all the cancer had been taken out. Some hospitals do this as part of the operation if they have the right equipment. Week 1 after surgery was hard and I was in pain. Week 2 I felt well enough to start the exercises I was give, Week 3 I was coping well with the exercises. Week 4 felt like I was recovering well with a good range of function. Had a seroma under the arm but luckily for me this went down over time.",

The suggestion in there was to take an anti-histamine for the pain. For me this was a huge breakthrough - I took Claritine and Benadrul instead of painkillers. We are all different and it may be totally the wrong thing for some of us. Just mentioning in case it is useful for someone. With food and drink I developed a list of things that tasted \"true\" and those who didn't. I had severe vomiting and sickness all through chemo and finding drugs to control this a huge problem.  Orange juice was a good taste for me plus fruit smoothies. I went from wanting tart tasting fruits in my smoothies to sweet ones and back. Lemon juice for me made water taste almost tolerable. Onions were my enemy. I couldn't bare the smell of them cooking or food with them in it.  I also drank milky drinks from the supermarket which was strange as I normally hate milk (the drinks from the milk counter). Alternated banana milk with chocolate.  Hope this helps. ",

It may be that people are too poorly to post and it may be the people are not having side effects and are not posting - we just don't know how many of each of these there are. What we need and deserve are facts. If we don't have facts then we only have opinions. I don't think a thread like this is going to be very useful if it only represents one viewpoint. I think we need to keep a  balanced mind and look for actual evidence to share. Alienating people and stopping them voicing their fears or experiences isn't going to help in the long run. When we express a strong opinion or label it as \"panicking\" we could risk doing this. All of us have opinions based on our experiences. Then there is the evidence from published research in medical journals and the clinical experiences of our doctors. Maybe we should be looking for this and presenting a more factual approach.",

If someone in my office did it for money I don't know how I would react. It would be very hard for me emotionally. If a friend had offered right at the start I would have been touched. Now, I would be appalled. Macmillan need to put the genie back in the bottle now. That's going to be very hard. They still have the webpage and all the apparatus set up to support the \"campaign\".  As I discovered a while back it comes up as an advertisement on future webpages if one searches for it. I think that this would be a service that they are paying for? My hope is that Macmillan listens to patients and takes down the website and stops people fundraising using this particular slogan. That would be a great start. At the moment Macmillan doesn't appear to be listening.",

I know that I have a genetic mutation in some of the CYP genes and it may be something like this which is meaning that the side effects have been multiple. The reason I was reading old research papers was to read up on nausea & vomiting as at that stage mine was pretty bad and I wanted a solution.   I'd love to find a recent paper on all the side effects and %'s if anyone finds one. I'll keep looking in the meantime. As an aside I am also doing FAR BETTER on Tax (and Herceptin) than I ever did on FEC. I did have the dose reduced in advance. My second T was better than the first so in a way I think I may have still been suffering the FEC side effects when I started T. I'd maybe argue for a longer break between the FEC and the T if one is seriously affected by the side-effects",

The patient in that article was switched to Doxetaxal and given anti-histamines and steroids  before the infusion. They also tested for the normal bugs that cause typical pneumonitis but found none. Xrays looked like normal pneumonia. \"\" (quote from link) Because of the risk of a recurrent hypersensitivity reaction, the patient was not re-challenged with paclitaxel and instead was switched to another taxoid, doxetaxel (Taxotere; Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, Collegeville, PA), that is believed to be less allergenic. Administered in conjunction with a premedication regimen consisting of steroids and histamine1 and histamine2 antagonists, five cycles of doxetaxel were tolerated by the patient without complications. \"\" It may be that you need to switch to another drug and then add the different anti-histamines as they did for the patient there. The steroid used could be important for some people. I'm very allergic and cannot tolerate Dexamethasone. Bad reactions to that in the past from doctors treating allergies.

When I had the examination in the breast care clinic they took a couple of biopsies of my glands at the same time. I was able to learn from this that the cancer had spread my my glands. It was probably my presenting symptoms (the swollen sore glands right up to my jaw) that made them do the biopsy then and there. The next step was to see if it had spread further. That was done by a CT scan. However, this took time and I started chemo before we had the results. It was clear. It's quite possible that the cancer has spread and your Mother had no symptoms. On the other hand it may be no immediate danger and quite treatable.  No way to know sadly. Even if the cancer has spread to her lymph nodes it may have got no further. The cancer I had was really well controlled by the chemo. My lump disappeared to almost nothing and the cancer in my lymph nodes disappeared. They did another biopsy when I had my lumpectomy.  My Mother had lung cancer that didn't grow fast and remained stable for a long. Sorry not to be able to give any more advice. It's wait and see sorry. Just make sure that they do the testing needed quickly and report back. Don't be frightened of asking questions or pushing them. Mine took a long time.

This is very hard to do when one is weak, sick, dizzy and has chemo-brain. The more of us who are fobbed us the less likely it is for side effects to ever be acknowledged in cancer treatment. The next thing that they will probably start doing as we (as a group) become better informed and less tolerant to listen to them is accuse us of looking at the side effects list and then being influenced. I didn't look at any info on side effects before I go them but that didn't stop them trying this on... Here's a list of side effects. You will see insomnia, dizzyness listed. Print this off and mark the ones you have then sent to to an idiot who argues with you.  http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Herceptin/Pages/Introduction.aspx I think that I have had my last Herceptin shot but I won't know until late August as they need to do an audit. Someone made a mistake in my log book. Towards the end of Herceptin I nearly had to insist on a break as I could feel the FEC-T side effects slow and the Herceptin ones start getting worse. In the end I stuck it out but as I did with the FEC-T I ended up on a 4 weekly rather than a 3 weekly cycle. I was going to ask for that with Herceptin.",

      "Content": "After my lumpectomy I had rads to my breast. The lump has been close to the nipple and the scar went partly around the outside. Booster rads was given to the scar. My nipple lost a lot of skin and was tender for a long time. Skin is only just coming back properly. Something I noticed in the weeks after rads that my nipple is now \"out of kilter\" and there is an very large area of tough skin where the nipple meets the skin/scar. Bit hard to explain. Large area of an extra scar / harder skin. Deep and thick. It's not like a burn but a big mass of deformed skin. There is the scar from surgery and then when the nipple starts this now \"whatever\". My nipple lost it's colour and it's still not back. The scar area and nipple are still very sore.  It's been 3 months now.  Has anyone else experienced this. Just want to compare notes.  I'm due to see the Surgeon in 4 weeks time and will talk to him then.  I'd had so many problems since chemo/surgery and rads that this is not top of my list. Every side effect keeps getting fobbed off and I need more info so I am better informed when I go in. ",

Something to bear in mind is the use of an antiviral drug if you do come down with shingles and also the use of GCSF injections to boost your immune systems. I'm prone (with out chemo) to recurring bouts of herpes simplex (manifests as cold sores) and shingles. For my time on chemo my doctor has added Valtrex (I don't do well on Acyclovir) for the duration. During my first cycle of FEC I got a outbreak of sores/blisters all over my face and my doctor thought it was one of the herpes viri. Valtrex cleared it up and has kept it at bay. Do you have the GCSF injections to do at home as part of your treatment. For the first 3 FEC cycles I got infections each time (sinus, tonsils etc) but since adding the injections I've been much better able to fight off \"things\". I realise that I had bacterial infections then but I am hoping that they are also good for viral ones? Just a few ideas. The chemo team may be willing to give you something as a prophylactic and they will know better.",

For the 6 months leading up to my finding the lump I was unusually tired and developed high BP at times and breathlessness on exertion. This was very unusual for me as I have a chronic low BP. It came out of nowhere with no unusual stress in my life until just before diagnosis. I am guessing that the immune system changes in the body as cancer develops are causing these physical problems. Not had enough time to do a proper read up of medical literature as yet to pinpoint how. Cytokines could be causing these symptoms. Both as the body tries to fight the cancer and as the tumour fights to become established. ",

Rads have left my breast in a bad state (swollen, painful and with thick scar tissue). The surgery had resulted in less movement to my shoulder and arm. It's hard even to type this.  Luckily my emotions are pretty good. I've had a neurological disease for much of my adult life so cancer hasn't been the terrible shock that some people experience.  It's been the actual treatment that has devastated my life and still does. What I am doing is counting down the time until my Herceptin finishes as each cycle gets worse. Then I hope that physically I can begin to recover. My heart goes out to the woman facing further drug therapy such as hormonal treatment  and are also experiencing terrible side effects.

      "Content": "Hi Cocopops, Yes, it could get worse and T could be even worse after that. I'm talking from my own experience only and not intending to frighten or upset you.  I ended up bed-bound and very sick / weak/ fainting /falling and confused from FEC and the drugs that my clinic gave me. Couldn't log onto to ask for help and advice in that first horrible cycle. Never recovered from FEC each month, it was cumulative and then Taxotore added it's own devastation. What I did was to take control and stop my Chemo team from doing further damage. This is what helped for me but I know we are all different so these are just ideas (just as an aside I am now about 3 plus months post chemo and not recovered as yet). These hints are intended for emergencies and people who genuinely don't think that can make it through. 1. Get the dose of FEC reduced if possible to the smallest therapeutic dose. In my case this worked well in that it shrank the tumour very well.  2. Change from a 3 weekly cycle to a 4 weekly cycle if not recovering or of side effects are too severe. 3. Don't be lulled into thinking that Tax will be significantly better. It was certainly different for me and probably better than FEC but had it's own. I got my team to cut the Tax dose down to the smallest amount possible to start with and I am so glad I did this. 4. Consider the idea you may be having a reaction not only to the Chemo meds but the other drugs as well. Look closely at any other meds they give you either as part of the infusion or after. I am thinking of steroids and anti-sickness meds. I had severe nausea and vomiting with both FEC and Tax. Some of the drugs they were giving me were not only having no effect on that symptom but making my fainting/ disorientation and weakness much worse. As an example I told them that I had reacted badly to Dexamethosone before but they insisted I take it for the sickness and vomiting. That was really bad advice. I got them to change this to Predislone. The other drug making me weak and dizzy was the anti-sickness drug Metoclopramide. This is under the side effects of Metoclopramide (only using this as an example). My clinic gives anti-sickness meds as part of the chemo infusion regime as well and they didn't tell me or give me any notification or a pamphlet on side effects \"Stop taking metoclopramide and call your doctor at once if you have any of these other serious side effects: slow or jerky muscle movements, problems with balance or walking; mask-like appearance in your face; very stiff (rigid) muscles, high fever, sweating, confusion, fast or uneven heartbeats, tremors, feeling like you might pass out; depressed mood, thoughts of suicide or hurting yourself; hallucinations, anxiety, agitation, jittery feeling, trouble staying still; swelling, feeling short of breath, rapid weight gain; jaundice (yellowing of your skin or eyes); or seizure (convulsions). Less serious metoclopramide side effects may include: feeling restless, drowsy, tired, or dizzy; headache, sleep problems (insomnia); nausea, vomiting, diarrhea; breast tenderness or swelling; changes in your menstrual periods; or urinating more than usual.\" 5. Ask you team for alternatives. FEC-T isn't the only regime. There are alternatives. As said these ideas are mentioned specifically for people getting side effects from Chemo and associated drugs that could possibly be avoided and to help make it possible for them to complete a course. I was lucky. FEC-T (even modified as I did) worked for me. It shrunk the lump and I was able to have a lumpectomy. It's not going to be the case for everyone though. The best people to talk to are your team but my experience was that they were useless initially and I had to be firm and insistent before they would listen.  That's hard to do when Chemo disables our minds and bodies.  Hope it helps.",

At different times of my chemo I wanted different things.

      "Content": "Hi Rox, My feeling is that you are entering one of these NHS \"Black holes\" of knowledge and experience. That was what happened to me anyway. I have a neurological disease plus I am under the care of an Immunologist for allergies. Don't see him very often as it is something I manage now by myself. My food allergies started with episode of anaphylactic  shock and were diagnosed using skin pricks and blood tests in a NHS allergy clinic (now closed..). My family is allergic and we can react badly and strangely to drugs and chemicals. Given my history the decision by my Oncologist was to start me on the NHS assembly line that they put everyone on, was possibly a bad one. We made a decision to go for chemo as my lump was too big for a lumpectomy. I wasn't prepared to be floored by chemo in the way that I was and by how little educated medical support came my way when I was,  Allergies to drugs in chemo, apart from a straight forward anaphylactic shock reaction, is not accepted by the NHS in my experience. It goes under a heading of \"side effects\" and then very little is done. They don't accept \"intolerances\" of drugs or foods as a genuine condition. It may be that your intolerances are not accepted or understood if they do not result in Anaplylatis. Once the drugs are pumped into us we are left to cope with the consequences. There are plenty of lists of side effects available but that's not much help, as in my experience, no one knows what to do once we have them. Even the simple sickness I experienced took months to deal with as i reacted badly to some sickness drugs and doctors shook their heads. There was no pathway for dealing with side effects if they continued and the patient needed care. My GP expected the oncologist to deal with it, my oncologist was out of their depth.  I did better online than I did with all the clinic doctors, nurses and GP's. My Immunologist was some help as well but I had to pay (as no NHS appointments) for this and was too sick to travel to see him. I was also lucky in finding a MacMillian nurse who dealt with palliative care at the local hospice but even that was far too late and too little.  I found that in the Oncology clinic there  was no knowledge of or attempts to understand how food or chemical reactions would affect a patients response to treatment. My previous bad reaction to Dexamethosome and request for this to be changed to Predislone was ignored until I took control and insisted.  I'd be personally less concerned about food allergies in Chemo and more concerned, given my experience, with your bodies reaction to the drugs. My reasoning behind this is that chemo was so severe to me and I had such bad vomiting, sickness and diarrhea that any consideration of existing allergies went completely out the window. Even now, around 4 months after my last big chemo infusion (FEC-T) I am still weak and sick with many other side effects. Some of the drugs used in Chemo (like cyclophosphamide) are being trialed in diseases that have an immune or autoimmune component so if your allergies fit into that area, they may even improve. I'd say that my own food allergies may have improved in some ways but I am still far too sick and weak to work that out fully yet.  Chemo (FEC-T) completely floored me. I was largely housebound for 6 months with occasional trips out for medical appointments in a wheelchair. I had infections on every FEC cycle and eventually refused to be hospitalised.  My liver enzymes were high and I never recovered in the 3 weeks of any cycle and cut the dose of drugs / changed to a 3 week cycle.  The Oncology clinic was not able to deal with such severe multiple side effects. I reacted to the chemo drugs, to the steroids and to the anti-sickness drugs.  They were only geared up to respond to people who had an immediate allergic reaction during the infusion or infections afterwards.  For me antihistamines and Benadryl were the most useful things.  Hydrocortisone and Predislone.  At every step (chemo, surgery and rads) I had allergic reactions to various things like dressing, creams etc. I got sick of dealing with ignorant staff. I don't want to give you the impression that chemo was \"all bad\", I had chemo to try and shrink a tumour too large for a lumpectomy. It worked really well for me. Hope this ramble helps. We are all different and you could be one of the lucky ones who breezes through. I don't feel as if I have written this very well. ",

Are there any signs that he might be in secret debt or in risk of losing his job? I am presuming that the bank balance is fine. Just hoping he isn't keeping anything from you. Did he maybe secretly panic when you were diagnosed? It's hard being a partner of someone with cancer. I can see my own husband indulging in more \"escapism\" than normal.  Otherwise, he needs to be told how this behaviour is making you feel. Rather than rejoicing that you are alive and acknowledging how much you suffered (and maybe him too) he is concentrating on money. Which sounds insensitive.",

My surgeon has always spoken about a lumpectomy and mastectomy only mentioned if they can't get what is left of the breast out with clear margins.

I found that Tax flared up all the old painful injury sites from a road traffic accident years ago. I throbbed and was in agony in what felt like all the old places that were broken and damaged. My legs, hips and spine.  Something I found useful when I was in pain was the antihistamine Claritine and also Benadryl. I added to this a drug I used years ago for nerve pain called Baclofen. What inspired me to try the antihistamines was an old paper I found on pain in chemo in relation to the drug some of us injected (Filgrastim).  The problem with taking co-codamol is the codeine which can upset a chemo stomach. It did for mine anyway. In general paracetamol does nothing for me as well.  An anti-inflammatory might help as well. I took some celebrex (which may not be good for you and the heart problem) and Ibuprofin when I ran out. some doctors say not to take NSAIDS but for me that they were useful. My Oncologist was happy for me to take these drugs but we are all different.  Your doctor may be able to suggest things suitable for your pre-existing medical condition that will ease the pain. Hope this helps. The chemo drugs are powerful drugs and for some of us can have a severe effect.",

      "Content": "Hi Sal, Totally agree about the appointments. I'm also sick of them and going back to the hospital brings back too many bad memories.  We do need to know about the frequency of mammograms. I'm not concerned about anxiety but I'd need to know at some point what I should be doing to keep myself safe and the best way to stop / find more cancer. People who do get anxiety need to know how to plan their treatments and testing to minimise this and still remain safe. At the moment most of my attention is going on getting over treatment. It's still a challenge to cope with the side effects from treatment as I am still having Herceptin and the previous FEC-T has badly affected me. I'll need to make a decision on the Mammograms so I am very grateful to anyone who joins a research project so we can get this data. We do need the facts. I found a good description on the MAMMO-50 trial here http://www.hra.nhs.uk/news/research-summaries/mammo-50-version-1-0-date/ They seem to be arguing several things. The first that stands out is that for the under 50's re-occurrence (either in the same breast or the other) is more likely (I'd like to know in what time frame and is this just age?) and that for patients who have had a mastectomy a mammogram is less likely to pick this up.  I think that could be really important (If I am reading this correctly) and mastectomy patients need to know if (if they are not already told?). This sounds as if the concern behind the trial isn't about anxiety but about the research arguments around finding a reoccurence using the Mammogram for both the under and over 50 patients  (and other things as well). They do a quality of life questionnaire which may be where the anxiety side comes in.  I'll need to read this through again and check when my brain comes online. I had my Herceptin injection today and I've a bad headache so could well be wrong. My apologies if so and I'll come back to this and edit if needed.",

At the moment the NHS usually offers a node clearance to women who have some proven lymph involvement. However, due to some trials in the USA, it's being questioned in the UK and there is currently a clinical trial here of different approaches to try and answer the question of what to do. http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/find-a-clinical-trial/a-trial-looking-treatment-armpit-breast-cancer-posnoc Sadly, it will be 10 or so years until we have the answer. There are the USA trials though which have been published and are changing the ways women are treated there. What I did was tackle it this way. I needed chemo first anyway to try and shrink the lump so I could have a lumpectomy. It was too large and in the wrong place to operate without reconstruction or mastectomy.  The lymph nodes tested positive on biopsy when I was first diagnosed. The chemo was grueling but a success, the lump shrunk to almost nothing. I decided on a sentinel node biopsy at the same time as the lumpectomy. For me, it worked. There was no cancer in any of the nodes they removed after chemo. I'm recovering from the surgery really well. Touch wood etc. Hope this helps. ",

      "Content": "Hi Lollywg1965, Glad to hear that you are comfortable bra less. I had a lumpectomy on September 23rd and have been living in crop tops since then. My sore boob is more comfortable in these. I sleep in them. Bought myself a larger one than normal from Sainsbury https://tuclothing.sainsburys.co.uk/p/Black-Seamless-Unpadded-Bra/124016750-Black Although I am doing the exercises and my range of movement is coming back the breast / armpit area is still very tender and I can't see myself back into a bra for a while.",

That said the SE's are continuing but at least I am strong enough to have a bath and get out of the house occasionally now.",
