      "Content": "Thank you so much, Sam - zap went OK yesterday, setting off for today's one as soon as my baking is out of the oven (the luxury of not being at work this week!). I had had the presence of mind to take a selfie of the red patch, so showed the radiotherapy gals the gross photo, and they didn't know what had caused the spot but said it wasn't them!  We are just going to continue, using the creams they have given me, but keep an eye on how things go.  I do have some Aveeno - it seems to be oat-based and there's no aloe vera in it - but will just use their stuff time being as instructed. It is a lovely sunny day here and I am actually looking forward to my 30 minute walk across the park to the hospital.  I'm conscious how lucky I am in that respect - I feel for anyone with a lengthy commute and/or an awkward appointment time.  But it is all in a good cause, and the end of these appointments is in sight for all of us.

      "Content": "Hi Jan (and Ange), just some reassurance on the 'zaps'.  We all refer to them as that, suggesting noise and some sort of a sensation like an electric shock perhaps, but actually YOU FEEL NOTHING!  There is nothing to worry about.  Unlike Ange, I have kept my eyes open, and there is nothing even to see!  The machine moves around you a bit - a head the size of a dustbin lid perhaps - but does not touch you.  There's a little screen thing on it, but no lights or anything.  The only time you see anything is when they are setting you up each time, when there are some red and green beams (a bit like the lines of light you have to line up when you have your eyes tested) but they are there purely to allow the radiographer so to check they have you positioned correctly - they are lining those up with the tattoos.  When they are happy with that, they leave the room (but can still see you) and literally two minutes later they come back in and that is you done till next day.   There is nothing to worry about - you'll be fine.  Lie back and enjoy!

Any advice for me?  I don't know whether to alert them before the first session or just keep fingers crossed and hope all will be well.  What will happen if I start coughing while being zapped?   Many thanks Queenfisher",

      "Content": "Sorry folks, it's me again.  I suppressed the cough long enough to have zap no. 1 yesterday, and no. 2 today. The creams they have given me are Betnovate, to be applied once a day, sparingly, early evening, plus Zerobase emollient, to be applied morning and before bed.  This evening I was feeling a bit uncomfortable but decided it was my imagination, but now discover I have a distinct red patch, slightly raised, in exactly the area where I know the problem lay.  If my skin is reacting after just two zaps, I'm concerned about what I'll be like after 19.  I did warn them that my skin is sensitive to lots of things, so it's possible it is the cream not the zap itself that's done this - but has anyone else had a reaction this quickly to RT?

      "Content": "Aha, thanks Twinkle51.  I have not been moisturising at all, though I do have some dry and flaky skin post-op around the incision.  I have been carefully avoiding anything other than water - no soap other than the shampoo run-off in the shower, and no cream.  My skin is sensitive at the best of times, so I am a bit wary of anything.  But perhaps I need to get going on a moisturising regime in advance.  Is Aveeno an aloe vera based cream?  Sadly (and unusually) I don't react well to aloe vera!  As it is in so many 'sensitive' skin products, this is problematic for me!  However, there's a Holland & Barrett round the corner plus a good pharmacist - maybe a little shopping trip is needed...  If anyone has advice on a non-aloe vera cream, I'd be very grateful! Just three zaps to go!  Well done Twinkle51! Queenfisher xx",

      "Content": "I suspect I am just going to add more confusion/flag up more inconsistency through what I am about to say, but here goes: Creams first of all - here in Edinburgh, R1 and R2 appear to be standard issue - to the extent that the booklet from the hospital mentioned 'special creams' and the printout I have been given with all my dates and times for zaps has on it, against session 1, something in an additional notes column about 'issue creams'.   Boosters - I was initially told I'd have 15 sessions of RT.  I was told after the first screening that I was stage 1 grade 2 ER+.  After the op, I was 'upgraded' to grade 3.  When I went for my RT consent meeting, onco asked if I knew how many sessions I was to have - I said I was confused as I'd been told initially 15, but had also been told 25.  Final answer - split the difference at 19.  Fifteen of these are standard RT, followed by four photon boosters (I think that is what they are called).  They are apparently more targeted and go for a very fine area, and are given because of my grade 3 status. I have queried a few things, and I reassure myself with the fact that everyone speaks very highly of the unit here.  They discuss us case by case at a multidisciplinary team meeting, and decide on what each of us needs.  I rationalise that they are the professionals, they are dealing with this day in, day out, and they have nothing to gain from getting it wrong.  So I trust them to know what's best for me.  I have been along today to have a stray stitch dealt with - following on from a phone call to my BCN, ie without a proper appointment - and other than a long wait to be seen, I couldn't fault them at all.  Friendly, reassuring, thoroughly pleasant to deal with.  Good old NHS.",

      "Content": "Hi Twinkle51, thank you so much for sharing your experience.  I shall be patient (I think we all need lots of patience in this game) and wait and see how it takes me.  I am someone who is used to planning ahead and typically I have commitments in my work diary for 18 months ahead - not being in control of my schedule does not come easily to me! Regarding bra, I went to M&S just after surgery and they fitted me with one of their soft post-surgery bras (no VAT to pay!) which has been fairly comfortable.  I found the scarring under the armpit more bothersome than the breast itself so have padded where it was cutting into me with one of hubby's giant hankies.  I'm hoping that the R1 and R2 creams they are going to give me will keep my skin under control during RT.  Have you been using those? Thanks again for your advice - we are all in this together, and it is great to have your support.  xx",

      "Content": "Hi Alison I have taken my time to reply to your excellent post, because I needed to do some 'processing' myself.  You have really struck a chord for me, thank you.  I think you are so right - many of us get through this by being busy-busy-busy, but don't actually take time to FEEL it.  In my case, the busy-ness was firstly looking after my family - breaking the news, reassuring them like mad (two adult children, both overseas at present) + husband; reassuring boss and colleagues; reassuring international colleagues (I do a lot of my work remotely through an online group); putting arrangements in place as far as possible to cover for my absence from work during surgery and recovery; and so on.  Emails were flying around amongst colleagues, some of which I saw, saying things like 'I know of no one better equipped to cope with this emotionally than you' or reporting to others in an online group that I was 'coping with this in her typically positive and upbeat way' and so on - strong strong strong and busy busy busy.  But I had a bit of a nosedive the other day -literally.  I fell over something, and did myself some minor damage.  And that completely wrecked me emotionally.  I found myself in tears for the first time since my father died a couple of years ago.  It wasn't the physical hurt, which was nothing a couple of sticking plasters couldn't fix.  It was very strange, and I still haven't quite got to the bottom of it.  Meantime, I have been asked to set up a support group at work for colleagues who are going through BC - and I have very mixed feelings about that.  I tend to say yes to everything, but am reluctant on this one.  I think part of it is not wanting to define myself by BC.  But I may also be recognising, slowly, that I can't give support when I NEED it myself.  Time off work is NOT failure, Alison.  My boss has told me she doesn't want me back yet!  I suspect (certainly in my case I think this is so) that we rush back to get back to 'normal' but without having processed the nightmare we have just been through.  I'm so grateful we are all here for each other in this, and very grateful to you, Alison, for making me stop and think.  I hope you can use a good break to look after yourself, and explore those mindfulness etc. options.  Enjoy!  And thank you again.
