    "Content": "Crystaljuju lemons really are the tip of the cancer myth ice burg.  There are so many claims of Anti-cancer foods, and my favourite, cannibis oil.  Do people really think that the medical professionals would still be treating with chemotherapy when lemon juice would do the same thing!  You can't beat a healthy diet and exercise. But we all know that when you have a cancer diagnosis you grab onto areas which we can control.  We are adults and we make choices on what's best for us.  Actually there is a wealth of credible information that cannabis oil is extremely beneficial in preventing the proliferation of cancer cells, especially so in her2 breast cancer... so I would go and read up on it. I put a direct link on the this forum only last week, giving clear evidence from a lot of experiments carried out by a leading pharma company, clearly demonstrating CBD oil is effective n boosting the effectiveness of herceptin and preventing proliferation.  I am happy to send you the link in a private message? as i cant list it here as admin are very quick to delete the information! ",
