      "Content": "If I were you and just to ease your mind, I'd phone your breast cancer nurse. Though my oncologist was brilliant and explained everything, I still phoned my bcn just to varify the results. I've been given same info as you for future apointments and I'm clear of breast cancer. I sometimes think how can I feel so tired and weak when I've been diagnosed as clear lol.  Well done XhugX ",

      "Content": "I was diagnosed in February this year. I start radiotherapy on Monday. That will be the last of my treatment until reconstruction late next year. During this year I have cried, punched walls, changed from being a 'laid back let everyone walk all over me person', to a 'don't even try messing with me person'. I've laughed at some of the positions I've been in through this. Had my boobs felt more than I ever have before, by a few different males lol. All been worth it. The emotions come and go. I cried this Christmas day because of what it could have been like if I'd have left it. I've spent days in bed because I couldn't face another 'your looking well ' when I'm going through hell inside. Think we could all take up acting lol.  But after 10 months, 11 cycles of chemo, mastectomy of left breast along with lymph nodes removal. I am clear of the bloody thing. Just having radiotherapy as a precaution. The crying still doesn't stop though. I think it'll carry on for a while yet. We are all going through hell and if crying helps, then it's good. I also had trouble sleeping and got prescribed Amitriptaline. This is something that can be taken for long periods. Unlike most sleeping tablets.  So cry when and where ever you want. Laugh at the mishaps and go with the flow as long as it's your flow.  Wishing you luck and sending virtual hugs for the rest of your journey.  XhugsX   ",
