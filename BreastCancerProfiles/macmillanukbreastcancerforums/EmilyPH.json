      "Content": "Hi Kezzacare So 'glad' to have come across your post as I am waiting for a referral after an GP's appointment on Friday. So sorry to hear you are so anxious, I completely understand. As for sleeping... I could use help with that also! Do you mind me asking what age you are? I am 27 with no history in the family so I am hoping this is nothing although I have the classic symptoms but no lump. I've only been getting to see a nurse (after the reception screening me as to why I need an appointment each time!) who has been prescribing steroid creams for over two months. She didn't examine me at all. On Friday when I asked her to look at both boobs together (as the worrying one is now much bigger and the nipple is a different shape, she went off in a panic and came back with two GP's and another nurse who all examined me.) They said the tissue on that breast feels thickened and I have no idea what that actually means or if that is a bad sign? My husband is exactly the same and doesn't like me talking negatively at all, which I suppose is a good thing but it doesn't stop the constant worry going on inside plus the stinging and itching which makes it hard to forget about! I would try having a warm bath with candles, stick some spa music on and get into a warm bed for a lie down. Hopefully you nod off. I would love to hear back from you and if not, all the best for tomorrow. I'm also clueless as to what the appointment/tests will involve, do you have any idea? Big hugs. Emily",
