      "Content": "I have been fortunate that until my diagnosis with cancer I was very healthy. My visits to my GP were limited to the odd minor ailment and I felt content with the service I received. However, a serious illness sure makes you take your treatment seriously and over the last year I have been in and out of the GP surgery like a fiddler's elbow! I had been a patient at the same practice for 25 years and seen quite a few doctors come and go but the turnover of staff seemed to accelerate of late and on my last few visits I have not been seen by a doctor whose first language is English. I do not have a hearing problem and I am articulate but I was finding it increasingly difficult to communicate my problems or understand their answers. The final straw came just before Christmas when I had spent some time explaining my problem and concluded with the words, \"It started about 10 days ago.\" And the GP replied, \"What started about 10 days ago?\" Argggh!! I asked a friend to recommend another practice and off I went with my medical card all filled out. It said on the card that was all I needed to do - wrong! I was given a stack of forms to fill in and asked to return with my passport and a utility bill to prove I was who I said I was and where I lived. I returned the following day and handed them in only to be told I was not allowed to register with them as I was already registered with a doctor in the area. I was spitting feathers! My husband was spitting swear words so I dragged him out before things got nasty. My daughter suggested we contact the Primary Care Trust for our area so my husband set about finding what to do and who to contact. I had to write a letter giving all our details (NHS numbers. Existing GP's number, address, etc.) together with a written explanation of WHY we wanted to change doctors. I didn't think I could write \"because I want a doctor whose first language is English\" for fear of accusations of racial prejudice, so I wrote a vaguely worded letter referring to large turnover of staff lately and sent it off recorded delivery. To my intense relief the PCT replied that we could change practice. My first visit to my new GP was so refreshing - absolutely no communication problems. Wonderful. And worth all the aggro! KateG",

It is so scary but it DOES get easier - honest! I found that they slowly 'weaned' me away from treatment - six-weekly appointments went to three-monthly, to six-monthly to annually. It is nice to have some contact with the hospital but I also found help from an informal support group. I belong to another site www.breastcancercare.co and someoneon the site posted an appeal and asked if anyone in her area was interested in a meet-up. Eight of us, all treated at the same hospital, get together for a lunch about every two months and it is so good to talk to other women who have gone through similar experiences. It is surprising how much fun we have and how much laughter happens at these lunches. Do try and contact others in your area - it will help. Best wishes KateG",

I don't know what Tamoxifen does to the metabolism and I will be interested to see how ceasing Tamoxifen in March (end of my five-year sentence lol!) will affect the speed at which I lose weight.

This was brought home to me this week when I heard a dear friend had been diagnosed with cancer, had died and the funeral taken place before any of his friends knew. I had known this man for 25 years; we belonged to the same club. He visited my house once every two weeks for a workshop so we were in fairly regular contact. He 'phoned me November to say he wasn't able to come to the workshop for a while as he was having problems with his knees and was going to have a joint replacement operation. I left a 'phone message for him in December, then sent him an email in early January. I 'phoned other friends to ask if anyone had heard from him or anything about him but hit a brick wall. Of course, what I didn't know was the joint pain had turned out to be cancer and he'd been taken into a hospice. I appreciate that families have their own problems and grief with which to deal but a quick flick through their loved one's address book and a 'phone call to a friend (or a Club Secretary) with the news would be appreciated. All this man's friends from the club are saddened that we could not support him with visits, cards or flowers. We are also disappointed that we could not attend his funeral to pay our last respects.

I think a lot of us experience this feeling of abandonment after the initial rush of; diagnosis and surgery, chemo and/or radiotherapy when we are suddenly set adrift with only a daily pill as a life-raft. Then, after five years they take that little pill away and we are cast off the life-raft. Yes, it is scary, but as long as you keep vigilant about examining yourself and turning up for your three-yearly mammograms, you are as likely as the next person to develop breast cancer.You are FREE!

Initially I was completely paranoid but you get used to taking precautions and it becomes second nature. I think if you work by the rule LET NOTHING PUNCTURE THE SKIN ON THE AFFECTED ARM, you'll be fine. By nothing this means: injections, blood-pressure cuffs, insect bites, sunburn and scratches received whilst gardening. If you do accidently scratch yourself, wash it immediately and apply antiseptics. Some doctors will allow you to have an open-ended prescription for antibiotics.

As a rule they use Letrozole (Femara) on post-menopausal women and Tamoxifen on pre-menopausal women. Both drugs supress oestrogen in different ways - please go to the 'Cancer Information' tab at the top of the page and then navigate to   'Breast Cancer' 'Hormone Treatments' where they explain the difference way these drugs are targeted. As far as I know there are no other comparable drugs on the market but both Tamoxifen and Letrozole (Femara) are well tested and respected drugs. My surgery was initialy delayed (for other medical reasons) and I was put on Femara as a 'holding measure'. It did me a BIG  favour because the Femara shrank the tumour so much that the surgery originally planned was changed so that I needed less radical surgery.

Something to look out for is a seroma - a collection of fluid near the scar tissue which builds into a swelling. It doesn't always happen but if it does then insist it is drained. My breast care nurses didn't want to know (I was a private patient) and refered me to the Consultant. The seroma was drained three times before it settled down but it didn't cause any long=term problems. Physiotherapy - horrible but worthwhile. It really does help if you do all the exercises.

      "Content": "They should tell you (but just in case they don't lol) not to use any perfumed products on your skin because it can interfere with the radiotherapy. This means no; body lotion, shower gel, deoderant, talc - you can only use Simple unperfumed soap. To help to keep the skin supple you can use a specific cream which they normally have on sale in the hospital shop. It is cheap and you get large tubs of the stuff. Radiotherapy has a cumulative effect and whilst I sailed through the first couple of weeks, the tiredness crept up on me and lasted for several weeks after my treatment had ended. Be kind to yourself and take it easy - have a lie down when you get home. Another tip which, strangely helps with the tiredness is to up your fluid intake - this means water not beer lol! Good luck with the rest of your treatment. KateG",

I have no medical knowledge but I imagine the medics will do everything to kick cancer's butt. This will probably involve a series of treatment; surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, followed by five years of a hormone therapy (if appropriate). There are practical things you may do; all depending on her circumstances. Does she have a husband? Does she have children? Does she have siblings? You may be able to support her by looking after children, cooking her meals, taking her to hospital appointments. I know I was grateful for any help offered. Best wishes KateG",

The routine diagnosis pattern is, mammogram, another more specific mammogram (using a more sophisticated machine), a fine needle aspiration, then a core biopsy, followed by other ultra-sound scans. These aspirations and biopsies need to be given to medical technicians for them to analyse. The medics (surgeons, technicians, radiotherapists, oncologists ) meet and discuss the findings and decide, as a team, the best course of treatment for the individual patient.

Radiotherapy, whilst not painful in itself, does leave the patient feeling whacked out. It seems radiotherapy accumulates in the body and whilst the first week or so you feel okay it gradually builds up and the effects last for a few weeks AFTER treatment ends. One tip which got me through it was to 'drink lots of water' - I don't know how it works but IT WORKS. You must also 'listen' to your body - if you feel tired then have a rest. Don't try and be 'Super-Patient' - lay back and get someone to peel you a grape. Best wishes KateG",

The oncologist at my five year check brought up the subject of continuing taking Tamoxifen for another five years and I groaned. He said it had been successful in trials but it was up to me whether to take it or not. From what I understand the effects of Tamoxifen continue for ten years anyway and, given my age and that I had a grade 1 tumour, I decided against continuing. I'm far more likely to fall off my perch from something other than BC. I stopped taking it in April and am still waiting for the side-effects to subside. Obviously for you it is different but do discuss it with your oncologist and ask for their honest opinion. Perhaps you can have another child and THEN go back on Tamoxifen? Best wishes KateG",

I took Letrozole before changing to take Tamoxifen and have done so for the prescribed five years. Okay, initially there are things like the odd hot flush, but within a few months the body settles down and it becomes like taking a vitamin pill. What is most important is that Tamoxifen PROTECTS  us from BC reoccuring.

Mind you, when the physio first bounced in (all jolly hockey sticks and attitude) about ten minutes before my surgery I wanted to throttle her! The thing that suprised me most was how numb and heavy my upper arm felt. The feeling gradually wore off but there are still areas of my arm into which I could stick pins and not feel anything - not an action to be reccommended lol! I agree you should really take care of your skin on the affected arm; don't allow the medics take blood pressure or blood or inject that arm. Wear gloves when you're gardening and use insect repellent and avoid sunburn too because that can compromise the skin. I'm nearly five years post-surgery and my scar is hardly noticeable. Good luck with your surgery and let us know how you get along. Best wishes KateG",

Radiotherapy will alter the breast making it firmer... and yes the other one still continues its journey south due to age. The best things you can do  whilst undergoing radiotherapy are: avoid putting anything perfumed on to your skin because it can react with radiotherapy, so no deodorant, no perfumed soap (use Simple soap) no bubble bath or shower cream, keep skin moist with Aqueous Cream (often sold in hospital shops), pat skin dry after washing and keep out of sun or tanning salons. I would also avoid wearing a tight bra - anything that rubs against the skin is to be avoided.  Some people sail through radiotherapy without any problems, others do have skin problems. I wish you luck with your treatment. KateG",

Feeling has gradually returned but there are still areas into which I could stick pins without feeling pain (something that is not reccommended lol!). They cut through nerves during surgery and it takes a while for the nerves to 're-wire' themselves in order to send the right signals. As to hot flushes - are you taking any hormone drugs like Tamoxifen or Letrozole? These drugs will cause hot flushes. I've not heard that radiotherapy causes hot flushes. It is important you keep your skin moisturised during radiotherapy - okay you say you are wet wiith sweat, but as long as you are dry and moisturised immediately before a radiotherapy session you will be okay. What is important is to keep your skin clear of any perfumed products because they can react with the radiotherapy. If your skin breaks down during radiotherapy there are treatments - clear salves and dressings which can speed the healing process. I found the nurses were much better at dressing and helping than the doctors. Don't 'put up with things' - you are entitled to care! Best wishes, KateG",

Some of these questions are difficult because some relatives died young or of causes other than cancer. I think to get a definitive diagnosis of familial cancer you need a detailed family history. As to the treatment you received, each case is taken on the detail of the diagnosis. They will have had a group meeting of all those involved in your treatment and decided on the best possible programme of treatment for YOU. Best wishes KateG ",

A friend, now aged seventy, was initially diagnosed aged 55 - had lumpectomy and radiotherapy had cancer develop in her other breast some 11 years later. She had mastectomy and a recon. I was diagnosed five years ago and treated months later. In March 2013 I go for (hopefully) my final appointment with my oncologist. I will then go back on the three-yearly mammogram programmme..

With the fatigue - again this may be age-related. I'm on Tamoxifen too and I think this may be a contributory factor in fatigue.

It will take time but slowly you will regain your strength. However, if you are really concerned then go to your GP. It might help if you write down exactly how you're are feeling in case they misunderstand you or you forget something. Lots of people feel frustrated that they don't get back to 'normal' after treatment but you will recover to perhaps a new but different 'normal'. Don't despair - you will get stronger.

The survival rate for BC patients is in the 80% - 95% range. DCIS is a 'good' cancer diagnosis. We all go through this horrible roller-coaster of emotions; one year after treatment I was getting out the Christmas decorations and remembering that when I was diagnosed I thought it might be my LAST Christmas - then Gloria Gaynor was on the radio singing, 'I will survive'... and I was a gibbering wreck.

      "Content": ".So glad to hear you've got good results; I know how worrying it can be to have these doubts hanging over you. I found the best form of therapy from a mutual support group. I belong to another on-line community 'Breast Cancer Care' and someone posted a notice saying something like 'anyone in the North Surrey area'. Because the Surrey branch of The Royal Marsden Hospital is in Sutton, Surrey, a number of us responded to the posting and now meet informally about once every six weeks. We have a pub lunch on a Saturday and just TALK. It was a bit awkward at first but we gradually started comparing symptoms, treatment, doctors etc. What surprised me most was the laughter... we laugh about such silly things... certain doctors and their funny ways, the humiliation of hanging around radiotherapy in skimpy gowns, and the feeling of being a 'beached whale' trying to get off the radiotherapy table. We also talk about things like the side-effects of the hormone drugs and swap tips. It really helps to be with others who have been through the same or similar experiences. If you can start the ball rolling in your area then I'm sure it will help. I did a small film for Macmillan talking about this and you can find it on YouTube; \"Macmillan Kathleen's Story\". Best wishes, KateG",

They then told me it was five years from surgery - that was January and February 2008. Then.... surprise... it was five years after the end of 'active treatment'. So my final five-year mammogram and 'chat' with oncologist will be five and a half years from diagnosis. (I started taking hormone tablets in September 2007 and and will continue to take them until I am (hopefully) discharged after my final annual mammogram in March. From then on, if I am discharged I will go back into the 'system' and have a mammogram every three years. I really hope I will 'pass' my final test and graduate with 'Honours' lol! It can be done!

The normal regime of tests involve: simple mammogram, specialist mammogram, biopsy, core-biopsy, and various scans. B.C. has a number of forms and it takes time to define so please don't be concerned that you haven't had an 'instant answer' diagnosis. Each patient is different and each diagnosis is different. There is normally a meeting of all the specialist teams: surgical, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy where they discuss and plan an individual treatment regime tailored to YOU! Best wishes KateG  ",

When taking Tamoxifen you can be prescribed locally applied oestrogen cream which helps this problem You can also request a vaginal lubricant called 'Sylk' from your doctor on prescription. One advantage of taking Tamoxifen over other hormone drugs is that you can use the oestrogen cream - with drugs such as Femara - you can't! One tip - most GPs don't have any idea about hormone drugs and don't realise that some of these drugs (such as Sylk and Gynest) are availble on prescription.  Best wishes, KateG",

For the first few weeks my arm felt very heavy and numb but I did my excercises (as per orders from the physio!) and recovered good movement. Four and a half years on and areas of my arm are still numb - could stick pins in it and not feel a thing... something NOT to be tried because of the danger of developing lymphoedema. Guard your arm against any puncture wounds: no injections, no blood-pressure checks, no blood tests, and beware of any breaks in the skin. If you do gardening make sure you wear thick gloves, avoid sun-burn, and avoid any biting insects. Like I said - don't break the skin! I may be sounding paranoid but it is better to PREVENT lymphoedema because you can't CURE it, and whilst the condition in itself is not life-threatening it is painful and best avoided. Tips for rads: slap on the cream, avoid ANY perfumed products, and VERY IMPORTANT drink lots of water. You need to keep up the fluids because it really helps with the tiredness. Best wishes, KateG",

When I discussed this with my surgeon he explained the difference between a sentinel node biopsy an axcillary clearance and I asked which he recommended. He said the clearance was the safer option. I belong to an informal group of BC patients and what I have noticed is that all of the women who are on the heavy side have had a clearance (including me). Of course this may be a coincidence but I do wonder if there is a connection. I suggest you try and pin the surgeon down and ask exactly why they want to do a clearance. Best wishes KateG",

If you do break the skin then wash it asap, put on anti-septic cream and cover. I know it always sound as if you need to be paranoid but it becomes second nature. Secondly, although they use the phrase axcillary clearance, it is rare that they take every single one, besides which the lymph nodes under the other arm compensate to some degree. Hope this helps.

Words of comfort can sound trite and 'fluffy' but I do know,from the progress of my sister's breast cancer journey, how things can progress. She was diagnosed in the 1980's with an aggressive cancer and had mastectomy followed by radiotherapy. She had two years clear before bone mets which were treated with radiotherapy. She then had around seven years of normal life before other mets  occurred. Bear in mind how much the treatment of cancer has progressed since the 1990's and hopefully you can see the trees for the woods. Big Cyber Hugs KateG",

You can try things like lavender oil on a hanky on your pillow and a hot milky drink when you go to bed. When you wake in the middle of the night you can also try mumbling some sort of rubbish like \"fluffy bunnies\" over and over again to crowd out the negative thoughts. (It works for me!) If you are not having radiotherapy then you need not worry about smelly stuff. Radiotherapy patients need to avoid anything perfumed on their skin because chemicals and traces of imetals in things like soap, talc and deodarants react with the radiotherapy rays. Keep skin moisturised as normal and have a word with your GP about your sleep problems. Best wishes, KateG",

At first I had no feeling in my upper arm - it was completely numb. This gradually faded, although there are still areas of my arm into which I could stick pins without feeling aything! I occasionally have sharp stabbing pain in the same area but nothing to 'write home about'. My drains were removed after three days which, on refelction, was far too soon because I was left with a seroma (a swelling caused by fluid) which caused problems. Although it may seem hard at first it is worth persevering with the arm excercises because it does help improve your range of movement. I was very scared before the start of my treatment but NOTHING was as bad as my imagination told me it would be! Best wishes, KateG  ",

I had my post-op radiotherapy delayed because I couldn't raise my arm up sufficiently but I kept on (and on, and on!) doing the exercises and now I can stretch my arm in in straight line up above my head. The physios at my hospital held a class for post-op patients and emphasized the need to do these exercises daily FOREVER because of the risk of lymphoedema developing (even 10 years on from surgery) if you don't keep the arms moving. As to post operative pain - I was worried and expecting to wake up in agony - I didn't. The surgeon explained that they inject a local anesthetic along the line of the incisions which dulls the pain until the healing process begins. And of course they also give you other pain-killing drugs. (Don't be shy to ask for something extra if you are suffering. It's all very well having a 'stiff-upper-lip' but come on - if it hurts ASK!) ALL THE VERY BEST KateG",

This was investigated in case it was secondaries but after MRI etc. I was given the all clear and began a series of proceedures which now have it under control. Until she has all results she should be at least treated with painkillers, preferably morphine-based pills such as tramadol, zamadol and/or painkilling patches. You really need to be persistant with the doctors and keep on complaining about pain. As to the constipation it is a side-effect of painkilling drugs, so your doctor should be prescribing a stool-softening drug and your mum should also increase her intake of fluids .

Dear me, that is a badly constructed sentence but I hope you get my drift! Do ask your oncologist to change back but if he/she refuses then I'm sure the side-effects will settle down given time.

My husband's employer has BUPA cover too so I went private.The only difference I could see between private and nhs was that I saw a consultant instead of a registrar and I had a private room. The follow treatment was exactly the same as nhs, however when I asked the breast nurse to drain a seroma she said only the consultant could do it, which I thought was a load of toffee! The breast care nurses didn't seem to want anything to do with me. This site is a great support, do come on when you need help. Best wishes, KateG",

In certain radiotherapy suites (not all) photographs of lovely spring scenes - apple-blossom, bright blue skys, etc. were projected onto the ceiling so the patient on the radiotherapy table might view these scenes whilst undergoing radiotherapy. It did make an uncomfortable experience a tad more bearable. In another area of the hospital the scanning machinery was painted with zoo animal; presumably with children in mind. My dentist has images of Dublin Pubs on the ceiling... but none of these images cheer me; possibly pictures of blossom, blue sky, and fluffy clouds might cheer me for a while but when one is ill there is little that will penetrate that carapace. I think images which are bright and cheerful are the most appropriate. So: more 'blue sky, bright blossom, fluffy puppies, sea-scapes, ...anything which depicts escapism...please! KateG",

(Think of the fluid you might get when you graze your knee.) It is uncomfortable and may need draining several times but it does eventually settle down. I don't know anything about the risks etc. of increased does of radiotherapy but you may get some answers by 'asking a nurse' (click on the blue type at top right of your page).

      "Content": "You should use a water-based cream to soften your skin before and after treatment. What you MUST NOT do is use any perfumed products (soap, shower-gel, moistourisers, talcum powder) on the area to be treated because some products contain, albeit small, quantities of aluminium which reacts with the radiotherapy. Here in the UK they suggest you wash the area with a product called SIMPLE soap - I don't know if you can get it in Spain or France, but there must be an equivilent? Most people will have a pinkening of the skin and you were unlucky to have been so badly affected. The skin beneath my breast was split and burned but I was given specialist cream to treat it and it did clear up after about three weeks. Another thing to remember is that you should avoid any 'sunbathing' of the area for about six months because you will be more inclined to burn than tan. Wear factor 40 sun cream and a large floppy hat - be pale and interesting lol! You will be measured up to map the exact site they will treat and be given pin-size tattoes to help align your body correctly on the radiotherapy table. Best wishes, KateG  ",

      "Content": "I can understand your concerns and it is a horrible scary time. I didn't have such radical surgery but I did have all my lymph nodes removed. I had a drain in the lymph node site for three days which should have been sufficient time but it wasn't and resulted in something called a seroma, which is a build up of fluid caused by scar tissue (a bit like the clear fluid you get when grazing a knee). It doesn't mean you will have this but it might have been good if someone had warned me of the possibility! Although physiotherapists are the last people you may want to see after (or before) you have surgery, it is wise to take their advice about excercising and stretching your arm. They usually give you a leaflet expalining all the excercises and how often and how long you should do these excercises. Another thing I wished someone had warned me about before my axillary clearance is how HEAVY my upper arm felt. I am now four years post-surgery and still there are areas of my upper arm which, because nerves are cut through during surgery, feel numb. I could stick pins into some areas and not feel a thing ..... however not to be reccommended lol! Sorry, if I sound 'moany' - I am grateful to my surgeon and to all the other medical professionals who worked to potentially save my life. Best wishes, KateG",

You're right about men wanting to 'cherry pick' the women younger than themselves (looking for a nurse in their old age no doubt) but there ARE nice genuine men too. Have you considered 'Internet Dating' sites? My single friends say they work so it is worth a try. There are plenty of free ones like 'pleantyoffish' but the better ones are those who charge a fee. It obviously pays to be honest but perhaps hold back on the health issues until later in a relationship, after all you are only putting your toe in the water. Yes, say something like; \"I am a widow aged 60. I am (tall, short, slim, cuddly .... whatever) \" Then list your interests, hobbies, etc. If you view other people's profiles it will give you ideas for your own profile. Best wishes KateG",

Although I was not aware of it at the time, my surgeon was, himself, ill with prostate cancer which, I think may have coloured his opinions about how he should treat his patients.... if it is suspect... cut it out! Eighteen months after my surgery, my surgeon died so I have no way of questioning his judgement, advice, or decision. I am in contact with a group of BC patients and we compare treatments and, because of this, I have come to my own conclusion.... not one that makes me very happy... but that it would seem that all the overweight patients have had an axillary clearance. Now, this may be because the docs can not grope through tissue to feel if axillary nodes are lumpy or swollen, or it may be a 'belt and braces' approach. Best wishes KateG",

I know it can be scary but BC is one of the cancers which has a brilliant survival rate and, okay, the treatment can be horrible but it is something YOU CAN DO! i belong to a BC survivor group - all ages and we meet up for a lunch every six weeks and observers in the pub where we meet would never guess what drew us together as a group and neither would they understand the joy and laughter.

I thought I had 'got away with it' (lol) but it snuck up and bit me because we carry on 'cooking' for some time after rads end. It WILL get better and heal (honest) and you are right to seek help from your GP, or you could go back to the hospital rads department. That is what I did and I had excellent treatment from a nurse in radiotherapy. As to the rest of your treatment, don't worry too much about delays because what they are now planning to do is simply a mopping up operation... they've shot the baddie down. Best wishes KateG ",
