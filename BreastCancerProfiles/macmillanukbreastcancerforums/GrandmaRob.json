    "Content": "My aunt who's is her 70s is booked in for a mastectomy next week, she has taken along time to reach this decision.  She has never married and is quite a private person.  I live near by so would like to be there to help but do not want her to feel that I am intruding.  She has no access to internet and is just going with what the consultant has recommend.  What I am looking for is for some advice on the help that she might need after she comes home.  Thanks",
