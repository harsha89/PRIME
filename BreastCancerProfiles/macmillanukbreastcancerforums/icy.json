      "Content": "Hi every1 i had my breast removed in Feb 13 followed by chemo and Radiotheraphy which finished in july.  I went through this alone apart from my 2 dogs who were there by my side the whole time they helped me so much in my recovery. Alas 1 of them was killed on the road and the seriously injured she lost her leg, Since then i have noticed i have terrible headaches that last all the time is this a common problem after treatment or is it just because of stress from losing my lovely girl.",

      "Content": "I had my  2nd FEC yesterday and my veins were already hardened slightly from the 1st treatment. I am having a Groshong line fitted just before my next treatment because of this. The Chemo nurses seem to think this is much better for me, it will save my veins and be easier to administer the drugs. It does worry me a little but they were all so positive about it I'm probably worrying for nothing. Karen",
