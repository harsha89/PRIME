      "Content": "Hello Kaz18  I was diagnosed with lobular breast cancer back in April this year. The \u2018lump\u2019 was 8cm and there were 22 lymph nodes involved. In May I had left mastectomy and full node clearance plus immediate reconstruction- a very long operation. I was in a dark place for a while for fear that it had spread however CT scan showed no spread (I got that news on my birthday). I am now doing chemo - a bit delayed because of problems with my wound healing - and will then have radiotherapy. Yes it is scary and hard BUT it is doable and you will find the strength and you will get support not least from the lovely people on here! Good luck and keep posting. Jo xx",

      "Content": "Hello lovely ladies - hope SE are being gentle to you all!  I had my last chemo (docetaxol) yesterday so I\u2019m here for a bit longer before shifting to radiotherapy in January. This group has been just so comforting for me throughout what I expect will have been the worst part of the process- and the chemo nurses of course. I have had nearly every SE known to womankind but there has always been some help for it and the reduced docetaxol dose made such a difference. You can do it - not easy by any measure- there is light at the end. Have a little plan for the end - we have a couple of little outings to see some friends the weekend before Christmas and that will be a little introduction back into a fuller life for me ( fatigue and complete focus on job in hand has rather shrunk my world for most of 2018).  Sending very best of vibes",

      "Content": "Hello  sorry not been here much recently - struggling with fatigue and exhaustion after last chemo but what a relief to get it completed! I have my radiotherapy planning session in Leeds this Friday so will shift over to that group in January.  As has been said before it is doable - not easy - but definitely doable as long as you don\u2019t suffer in silence. I have now lost eyebrows and eyelashes and lots of other previously hairy bits too . My sister says I look like Matt Lucas! TheScriptFan congratulations on both fronts - the chemo doing such a good job on the tumour and impending grannyhood - . AnnJac so pleased they got you sorted - onward and upward.  Whatever stage you\u2019re at I wish you minimal side effects - be really kind to yourselves.  I am hoping for some tastebuds for Christmas and then a little more energy in 2019. Love Jo",

      "Content": "Hello TheScriptFan thanks for the reply. Yes that\u2019s a good description - a complete lack of energy. Some days I don\u2019t think I have the strength to fight my way through the skin on top of custard!!  I hope my tastebuds follow yours as that third weekend I\u2019m going to friends up above Hebden Bridge and one of them is an amazing cook. The day before it\u2019s pizzas with my friend and her two little boys in York.  Will you need radiotherapy after the operation? And have you got plans for The Script concerts to celebrate once you\u2019re done?  I have my picc line coming out on Monday and plan to take cakes in for the nurses - I will do some baking but my sister will do most - she makes a scrummy carrot cake and Ferrero Rochet muffins. Say I probably won\u2019t be able to taste them love Jo",
