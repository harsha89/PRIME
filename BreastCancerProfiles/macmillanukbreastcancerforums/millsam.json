    "Content": "I was getting hot flashes almost immediately starting chemo, which put me into menopause.  Sept 2011.  Didn't start taking tamoxifen until May 2012.  The hot flashes were unbearable.  Several during the day and several during the night.  I was exhausted from not getting proper sleep.  I was embarrassed at work as I would sweat profusely.  Dripping down my neck and my hair (that had grown back and is still short) would be wet. I talked to my Onc who suggested that since I am ER+ that obviously I can not use hormone therapy and that Oxybutynin was their suggestion.   2.5mg twice a day.  But for the first 30 days take 1/2 pill twice a day then a full pill twice a day. Well within a week I felt 90% bettery and I have stuck to the 1/2 pill twice a day. (morning when I wake up and then before bed).  It has made the world of difference.   I did not go to the full dosage as it wasn't necessary.  If in the future the hot flashes get bad I will up the dosage  but for now the 1/2pill is doing the trick. I still get what I call hot flushes vs hot flashes but they are very mild compared to before oxy and I can tolerate them better.  Having ice water near by helps or a cool breeze. My only side effect is a dry mouth but that just makes me drink more water, which is good for us anyway.  I do not find that it causes sleepiness. I suggest if anyone is experiencing uncontrollable hot flashes to give Oxy a try.  Yes Oxy was originally created for bladder issues but controlling hot flashes was a positive by product that the test recipients experienced. ",
