      "Content": "Hi there, I posted a very similar question when I was about to start T, can't work out how to put in a link to it but if you search for a thread titled Docetaxel it should come up. I got some very helpful replies. Everyone reacts differently though and I didn't get half the symptoms other people talked about.  It's not nice changing is it, just when you've got the hang of one type of chemo. I had FEC rather than AC so I can't comment on that but I didn't find T as bad as FEC - at least to begin with. There is normally no sickness with T and I had bad sickness with FEC. A couple of days after having it I had a yucky mouth, although I was still able to enjoy food. I didn't get any of the aches and pains people talk about, I just felt mildly unwell for a few days. My eyebrows and eyelashes fell out but I think my head hair started to grow back! It did follow a predictable pattern with symptoms kicking in 2-3 days after and lasting 10 days. However I felt worse the more cycles I had. I got bad bouts of depression and felt generally pretty rough. I was a lot more fatigued in between cycles. I hope you get on OK.",

      "Content": "Hello there Sorry to hear you had a tough time with FEC. I suffered badly with that too, was admitted to hospital 3 days with the first cycle as I was throwing up every half hour and couldn't even keep water down. After that I used aprepitant, amongst other things, with some success. I still felt rough but it kept me out of hospital!  However, T was very different and I didn't feel sick at all! Most people say sickness isn't bad with T. I could hardly believe my luck on the first T cycle as symptoms were really mild. I did feel worse on subsequent cycles and suffered depression, but in many ways I found it easier than FEC. Please don't give up yet! You can do this!!! All the best.",

      "Content": "1. Yes, my head hair started growing but I lost my eyelashes and eyebrows towards the end! 2. Pain - I had next to none. 3. Didn't have pain, but the other symptoms (taste, general ill feeling) started 2-3 days after chemo. 4. n/a 5. I weighed 50 kg before and put on 2 kg during T, so not a lot. As you can see, not everyone gets it badly! All the best - you can do this!!!",

      "Content": "Hi tiger-777, I had FEC-T and survived, so will you! It is tough but as well as downs there are up times too. In between my first few cycles I actually felt really great. But everyone has different experiences. Some find FEC worse, others find T worse. You'll find out ways to cope as you go. I recommend reading up as much as you can, I found blogs written by people who had been through it really helpful. All the best. L",

      "Content": "In that case could you compromise and have a thick soup at meal time? And make sure you have as much liquid in food as possible? That will help with the hydration a bit. I used to find bland tinned soups went down well. Other than that, tiny sips of liquid whenever you can.  It's hard isn't it when you know you should be drinking lots to flush the chemo through but your body says no! Sympathies!",
