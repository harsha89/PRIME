    "Content": "Hi Kelly, Im very new to this form of contact, but you sounded panicky. Staying positive is very tricky business but if you're worried about the side effects and they are going round in your head try to prevent them before they could start. Always remember that not everyone gets them. Â I was reading somewhere on this site of a company trying to address lots of the side effects. creams and nail products. I think it was called Ralife and onicolife. Concentrate on things that make you smile before this happened and things you have to look forward to after it has gone. I always concentrate on my children and family watching them also listening to my friends chatter makes me smile. So what im trying to say very badly concentrate on what makes you smile. I hope this helps sending you positive bubbles Parker x",
