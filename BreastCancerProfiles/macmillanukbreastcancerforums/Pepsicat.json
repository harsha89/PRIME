I started docetaxol in June and saw some improvement after first cycle but by the time I went for number 5 it was obviously not working as there was some deterioration so the last 2 cycles were cancelled.  Having fifth and final radiotherapy tomorrow which is to try and improve my lymphoedema and then start chemo on 6th Oct.  xx",

      "Content": "Sorry to hear that, l was first diagnosed in 1994 and had a lumpectomy & radiotherapy after which I was fine apart from mild Lymphoedema. I then found a lump under the opposite arm in 2014 and had ultrasound, mammogram, bone, ct & mri followed by pet scan which confirmed cancer was back. cureently having second round of chemo - first started October 14 and then enjoyed a gap until June this year. It is different this time, there is so much information and far more support and of course forums like this and there is also a drop in centre in the town where I live where cancer sufferers and their families are always welcome. I wish you well and send you a  big cyber hug.",

I have skin mets and dont  see the same doctor every time so having the photos help them see if things are better or worse. There was also a consent form to sign with 3 options as to how the photos could be used from fairly restricted to using in medical journals - I signed the lot as the photos don't show my face and if they are helpful for others then that has to be a good thing. I'd say go ahead and don't worry. xx",

Got the higher level for both components and he also applied for a blue badge on my behalf - it only took a couple of weeks. Having looked at the forms myself I'm not sure I would have got the same results. Good luck ",
