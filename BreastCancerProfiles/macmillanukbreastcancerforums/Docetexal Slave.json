    "Content": "Would it help to let you know that my oncologist was willing to wait six weeks between diagnosis of breast cancer and the start of treatment because I wanted fertility treatment first and my lump was roughly 7cm x 7cm? Would it be reassuring to know that 9 times out of 10 a lump in the breast is benign, usually a cyst? The only way that you can be sure is to have a biopsy. When I was being examined, it started with an ultrasound which progressed to mammograms and then, onto biopsy because they had spotted an abnormality during the other procedures. Would it help you to know that you are entitled to seek a second opinion in these two weeks?
