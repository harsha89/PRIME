    "Content": "hi kevin 2 weeks is not a long time to come to terms with it specialy with so many apointments & things to do. as you say there is nothing you can do personely to take it away, but you are lucky that your wife is staying positive so its your job to support her & stay positive yourself, you will proberbly have a tough time over the next 12 months and do a lot of the jobs around the house that you may have not done before but staying positive is better then any treatment she is given, that goes for both of you, times will get tough but they will improve after the chemo is finnished. regards paul",
