    "Content": "Hi Kerry, My prostate cancer cells have invaded my spine after metastasing through the lymph nodes. I was bitterly disappointed when the scans revealed this 12 months ago, as the initial 9 weeks radiation and hormone-blocking injections had pushed the cancer into remission for 18 months. I started the biphosphonate (Zometa) infusions to try to regulate the attack on the bone, and am coping well with this monthy treatment. I think the reason why I was so upset - and I think these thoughts may be contributing to your anger - is that I imagined treatment would 'heal' me, make it all go away and I would be the same person again, before cancer. But... but... it's not like that. The medical teams can't just throw everything at me to kill all the cancerous cells in my body -the body wouldn't be able to take it. I know it's hard, but what we have to do is take it all step by step, and realise that managing this illness is itself a kind of victory (isn't this what we mean by 'learning to dance in the rain'?). Others have said that our psychological approach is important, and I believe it. This site can contribute to this, if you just listen to people's stories and realise what an amazing amount of positive thought and energy there is all around us. Now if the scientists could produce that in a pill form...wouldn't that be something! I wish you well coping with your Mum's illnesss. Remember that no-one involved with it is cavalier and non-caring. They are all doing what they truly think is best. Purrs from Mr Gumps stretched fast asleep on my desk. This little creature keeps it in perspective for me. Best wishes, Gumpy",
