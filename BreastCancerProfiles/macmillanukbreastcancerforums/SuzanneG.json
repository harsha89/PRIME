      "Content": "Hello All :) This is my first post. I've been lurking, reading and learning much but I have a niggle that just won't go away and was hoping for some advice. I was diagnosed at the back end of July, lumpectomy and SNB on 28th Aug. Results were 29mm, grade 2, IDC, 0/3 nodes, evidence (?) of lymphovascular invasion. I have had my 1st FEC 10 days ago and I'm feeling pretty good after a few rough days. My worry is.... I have had a painful upper arm for months (long before I found my lump) and I had been ignoring it as just soft tissue damage that would repair itself eventually. I had \"tennis elbow\" some years ago and it took about 4 months to get better. I mentioned my arm pain to the MacMillan nurse when I was first diagnosed and she said it was probably a frozen shoulder. Off I went to see my GP who seemed to agree that it is early stage frozen shoulder. I have also mentioned it again to the MacMillan nurse at the hospital as I was worried about the cancer having spread to my arm bone... she said that it won't have done because my nodes were clear. My blood tests just before my 1st chemo were at the low end of normal across the board. I have not mentioned my arm pain to my oncologist but I am seeing him before my next dose. What do you think? Am I worrying unnecessarily? Should I mention it to my oncologist when I see him? Any help/advice would be really super :)Thank you, Sue",

      "Content": "Thank you all so much :) I feel a bit more relaxed just having offloaded my worries about it. My husband has been brilliant but I can't worry him about every little niggle I have. Luckily it's not too long until I see my oncologist again and so I will talk to him.   It is just a niggle in my head but I need to be reassured.... I thought my lump was just a cyst or lumpy booby due to the onset of the menopause and look what that turned out to be.   Overall I am very upbeat as everything is so very positive. Thank you all again and good luck with all your treatments. Sue x",
