I'm starting tax tomorrow and not looking forward to it after the stories I've heard. I know its annoying when people say this but at least you have only one left of the nasty tax...hopefully fec will be kinder to you. I found it OK, nausea and fuzzy head was the worse once my anti-sickness were sorted. In stopped the cap after my second session as I had thinned so much it was way too cold. Best of luck, its horrible stuff but it works so keep being brave x",

You will find good days and bad days, coming on this forum has been a massive help for me so hopefully will for you too. Take care x",

      "Content": "Chemo is going OK thanks, I'm taking the week immediately following the chemo off work, but finding that by the Friday I'm able to do a bit of housework and stuff. Â My husband helps with the little one on the first few days then I'm able to take care of her again with minimal support. Â I then go back to work (I work part time, 3.5 days a week) for two weeks until the next cycle starts.Â  I find that in the two weeks I'm back at work everything is pretty much back to normal, both in terms of how much I can do at work and in terms of running my household. Â I'm lucky as my husband is very hands on so I do have help. Â I get more tired than I normally would and I have had to stop running but I've kept up my yoga practise.Â  I know what you mean about cancer putting a stress on the marriage. Â We've been together 12 years but only got married at Christmas. Â It wasn't how we intended to start our first year of marriage! Â I think the key thing is to keep talking to each other so you know how you're each feeling and can talk it out. Â We also discussed having sessions with a councilor later on down the line if things get more difficult. Â  Keep in touch and let us know how you're getting on. Â XXX",

      "Content": "Hi Mad dog, sorry you're having to go through all this. None of us want to be here but this forum is invaluable for support. There's also an under 50's Facebook group which is ace. I'm 32 with a husband and a two year old. I was diagnosed in June and have grade 3 invasive ductal. Stage not confirmed as I'm having chemo pre-surgery but they think stage 2. I'm half way through my chemo and its not been too bad. I have had three fec so far and side effects have been manageable with the support of my family. I've been really lucky I think. My biggest piece of advice to you would be to try and 'let go' as much as you can. I am a big control freak and worrier but this just isn't possible with cancer treatment. You have to take each day and each next step in the treatment process as it comes, without looking too far ahead. We have this disease and we can't change that but we're in expert hands and treatment these days is amazing. I've been so reassured by my drs and chemo nurses. I know what you mean about your husband's attitude. My hubby has been fab overall but was very depressed and withdrawn initially after diagosis. Others have been as you describe, I think that's a coping mechanism, act normal and minimise the fear because \"it's nothing to worry about\"... We didn't have any fertility treatment pre-chemo as there wasn't time. We had wanted more kids but we're coming around to the possibility this might not happen. My onco has said she thinks my periods will come back post-treatment and so after three years of tamoxifen we can discuss kids, but my cancer is extremely hormone receptor positive so it would be a big risk if any cells had been left behind. Will be thinking of you in the coming weeks, use your breast care nurse for any questions or anxieties....they are a font of knowledge, as are the ladies on here. All the best xxx",
