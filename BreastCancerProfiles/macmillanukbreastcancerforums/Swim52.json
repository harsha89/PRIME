      "Content": "Hi Crissie, I had stage 3 finished my treatment November 14 after 22mths of treatment. The chemo is hard but it's a journey we have to take. Feeling low is very normal, but there is light at the end of the tunnel !! I had a very bad reaction from one of my chemo drugs but they put me on another one ! As you can see I am here to tell the tale. It all takes time to recover (I still am) it's slow & hard. If there is one thing I would say is be kind to yourself, take your time your body has had a beating. You take care it's great to share x",

      "Content": "Hi there, hope your FEC treatment is going ok? As AmyLou has said we are all very different, it affected me badly I had six rounds last year. The hospital can give you all sorts of things for the side effects you may encounter !! It seems most things I had gave me side effects (but I got through it)!!! My advice would be take all the help you can get & be kind to yourself. Put your feet up if you feel tired, listen to your body. Take care, I hope you sail through x",

      "Content": "Sorry to hear you are in hospital. Hope you recover very soon, I ended up in hospital with a blood infection & neutropenia, no one was allowed in without apron & gloves. I didn't want to eat much either, what with  a bad mouth etc.... But my husband use to bring in melon. Which I enjoyed until it tasted completely different & unlike melon.!!! The hospital had different choices of what I could or couldn't eat, it's a bit like being pregnant avoid soft cheeses, Mayo, raw eggs, pat'e, you can get loads of info from the hospital just ask. As for my blood infection it could have been through injection picking up something on my skin ?! They just didn't know ? After nine days I was discharged, it took a while to recover Compleatly. But I did as will you, hang in there as bad as you feel things do get better ! Sending you a hug ",
