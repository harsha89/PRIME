      "Content": "Dear Matt I'm also triple receptor negative (grade3, stage 3 with lymph involvement). I've just completed my 6th round of chemo with 2 to go but I'm already starting to feel anxious in a similar way to your wife. Once the 'buzz' of the initial shrinkage experienced wore off the doubt and fear started creeping back in and it's really tough. You just want to feel like you are 'winning' - just some sign or news or something to keep you going, to lift you. I'm not quite there yet as I'm still trying to claw my way through my Docetaxol (after an easy time EC I'm being battered now) but I would imagine that once the proactively of chemo stops you must feel in limbo - it's weird how when you find out you have cancer you just want to crack on and get working on getting rid of it but it feels like the rest of the world has gone into slow motion - every day you wait for a scan or an appointment or a slot on the chemo ward feels wasted, a missed opportunity. I'm sure it doesn't make a huge difference but the last of urgency concerning YOUR LIFE makes you feel very vulnerable. Sending lots of love and understanding to your wife and also to you - I hope you are gaining some comfort from the replies (and also seeing that it's completely normal to go a bit nuts during this bonkers time)? Take care.Â ",

      "Content": "Hello there Thank you so much for your note. Most threads seem to talk of nail problems but my issue is in the tissue. I only had my first Docetaxol on Monday and the pain in my fingers is awful. It feels like they've been trapped in a door and it's hard to exert pressure when picking things up. I also have a sore, red and patchy rash on my hands. It's only 5 days into my first treatment. Do you have any advice? Thanks so much. Take care",
