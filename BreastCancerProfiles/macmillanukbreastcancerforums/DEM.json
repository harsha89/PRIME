      "Content": "Hello ladies and gents. Over the last few days I have read the whole discussion,and can see there are those  who are against alternative and ones who go for the conventional treatment and those who are looking for ways with alternative treatments. I was diagnosed with Mucinous mixed IDC on the 17th Jan while still in shock ( was told it was an early lump probably a fibroid) to a stage 1. grade 3 and HER2 + Er+ which makes for an aggressive cancer. Without being told any thing and no discussion with any one I signed to have lumpectomy..when at home I felt a need to find out more on the internet.I did masses of research and read many clinical trials etc at the same time as researching alternative methods When Ilooked at the chemo drugs it was suggested I have I was horrified at the possibility of secondaries , Lymphodema  and with the drugs suggested there is a possibility of left ventricular heart damage and heart failure many other things all of which made me feel this was all negative (to me) as would reduce the quality of life for my future and would be constantly wondering if it had returned. Yes it does say that these are rare but even the common side effects where unpleasant or worse and would some times be permanent. The oncologist said I would be having Adriamycin and cyclophosphamide with herceptin running concurrently for first 12 weeks .Then herceptin 3 weekly for the rest of the year. First  think I found out was that both have negative effects on the heart and although this is monitored and treated if an event should happen it can also have long term effects not showing till later years. Then while researching more I was told that this combination known as AC including Herceptin is not used in the Uk because of its high toxicity and intolerable side effect and death. !!!!!!!!! I got a phone call , an appointment to start my chemo 26th Feb. although I had phoned the day after seeing the oncologist to not set up treatment plan. ? as I had arranged to see the consultant again . I now have an appointment to see consultant again and told I have a new appointment to see oncologist which is good as I have a LOT of questions to ask. So I will know more when I see them on 3rd March. While all this has been going on I did a detox to Alkaline my body No sugar no knightshade veg etcand was ketosis for a week or so  but have fallen away when my grand children surprised me with a big chocolate cake for my 60th bithday. Bless them :-).and have had a few things since ie a biscuit or crisps coffee with honey etc.and feel guilty to my body for doing it .!!. I have been using various supplements during this time and lots of organic veg etc. I will post again after my appointment as no firm decision has been made yet as which way to go .I know which I would prefer to do..much healthier. In the meantime I wish all you ladies out there good luck with your treatments and Love Light and well being in the process. Stay strong and HAPPY.xxx",

      "Content": "Hello Ladies Im so pleased to hear from you ,at last I have someone to chat to over this BC stuff , I keep going from positive to down in the dumps and driving myself crazy going round in circles in my head over and over again.. Ahhhhh. Like you forget for a while and BANG its still here.. After surgery I have been left with a very small tight inverted breast a full half gone and wish I had been given a choice ,but I just signed the paper while still in shock !!!!. 10 mins before going to theater I was told I could have a skin sparing mastectomy...and she could talk to the surgeon and stop the surgery...having waited 3 hours and got myself into a state totally anxious ,I went ahead as they came for me to go down. This is my reason for going back to see consultant as was told I could have it done after treatment ( should I survive what looks like a very dangerous treatment !!!!??. anyway I would like it doing now as it feels like a ticking time bomb on my chest as there are still fibroids and cycts in there and who knows if there are any more DCIS  as there was one in the main cancer lump. I was at the clinic in Sept 2013 when my GP found a tiny lump but the clinic didnt do a mamagram !!!!!?  didnt think there was a lump.. and I guess this is why I have been rushed through the system (conveyer  belt ) ..Ie . GP Friday 2nd Jan ..phone call monday  5th 10.30 am to be at the clinic 8am the 7th.. Mamagram,US ,Biopsy (anesthetic hadnt had time to work ,horrendous pain nearly fainted). Results stage 1 grade 1 .. op on 22 nd . now a stage 1 grade 3...  Basically the consultant new well a BIG mistake was made. he said this is a new lump and thinks its a fibroid.. ??? Yea rite !!!!. Soo on the grounds of this and him saying when I complained of having been given no information he apologised not seen the person behind the cancer... AHHHH again.I want this breast tissue gone NOW..before any other treatment...which I am terrified of after learning about the one suggested...no chance.. I want to live !!!!. To be continued >> Thanks for being there Ladies I need to be able to just say this stuff.. Waiting till the 3rd now !!!! Love Lite and healing to you all.XX",

      "Content": "Hello and sorry not been back with update as so much goes on and in between research ie finding out that the chemo the BCN told me I was to have was wrong one,s and as she spelt them out to me I wasnot mistaken !!! three weeks of anguish wondering why such a harsh treatment when its a 2.2cm stage 1 grade 3 no lymph node involved and clear margins...!!!!!? I am over reacting  ? as was only having chemo as the loading for the herceptin .. Oncology meeting. Lovely young woman (,not onco himself) .started to go through everything ,at last brilliant :-) .told me it was to be short cycle of Doxetaxel cytoxyan  3 wkly + herceptin wkly for 12 weeks then H for remaining year 3 wkly. Why Oh why has this all been such a mess ..stating with little things like is the blue stuff for locating lymph nodes radiation. No its dye...why cant they just tell the truth..this is Ireland tho and I know of others with cancer who are getting every bit of information ,with me they are just getting me through as quick aspossible because of missed diagnosis ..but im still a person.. OOppps..Im ranting but hey its good to right this down and hope anyone reading will understand. Moving on..Had chemo friday no problem what so ever..sat buzzing on steroids ,didnt like it but did a bit am and rested.up till 2 am tho. had the nualasta injection 1 pm and only slight sensation up tp now no pain .Great. Today. still ok altho tongue bit sore ( taken my partial denture out ..Shuuu ) .When I  went to get washing in and its not 20 yds and was out of breath and heart pounding took a while to settle ..didnt like it so having the rest of the day off. I do feel better for having got through the first one as I was so nervous about it. The reason I looked at this discussion was seeing \"Cloecat 45 post and was heading in the same direction as in was hoping to do alternative less invasive treatments and went a long way in aquiring the herbs and supplements etc doing a big detox  no sugar (only from food ) not even fruit for a couple of weeks and taking supps, fresh lemon tea and ginger ,green tea, buying Organic when possible ,no or little red meat no dairy ,was tuff but I am sure that it must help to reduce toxins and lessen side effects of chemo.I live in Hopeand will use them all as maintenance when treatments finish... Cloecat45 I am following your progress but have not had a chance to research what you are doing. I do admire your strength in going your own way and managing the lac of communication these things seem to create. So pleased that you are carrying on with your way with confidence. Good on you girl.I knowyou have a huge list of supp .s and wonder if you want to email and share knowledge.? I hope this makes a little sense and it brings it up to date with my journey so far.. I havethe herceptin on thursday as they thought it would be too much all three same day and will post how it goes. Hope I haven't bored you all with my rant ...but I do feel better putting it into words like an of load with a good friend. my sole friend died 4 years ago this month Not cancer but tragic and I miss her.   Love light and Healing to all.

      "Content": "HELLO. I am still not finding my way around this site ,as mentioned before not very tecno minded. I see/ remember your last post and I think we are of a very similar mind set especially with regard to just doing as we are told !!!! no way this is my body and I want to know every thing about what is happening and although there are those who would just go along with the plan that is given to them ,I also feel I have made life a bit harder researching so much as not everything I have read has been to my advantage ,I think I scared myself more knowing the details but then I would rather know than not .As you say like lambs to the slaughter or after the horse has bolted is just not me . The other things we seem to really agree on ie food, packaging, carcinogenics in general , the more I have learned the more I am determined to change my life style even though I thought I was living a healthy life I  know there is masses of room for improvement . I enjoyed your rant 90% could have come out of my own mouth . Today I went for the Herceptin the important one I need and having read the affects it can have was quacking in my boots .... nothing ...not a thing ..I can be my own worst enemy... but this journey and its cock ups so far haven't helped my confidence , like today , a canular was put in by my elbow but trying it, it was filling under the skin so another was put in my hand . When she came back with the Iv stuff she put it in the elbow ......errr \" I thought you where using the hand \" ...Oh yes and moved it... what the consequences could have been I don't know... F..F... sake . It would be much more comfortable if I could trust, but its hard.. Well im tired this eve so going to zone out in front of the TV for a while . Badly need to catch up on sleep as have been sleeping like a baby...awake every 2 hours . I know I mentioned it before about B17 apricot kernels, I was only taking a low amount till I knew where I was going and the Essiac tea I used for 6 weeks and I could tell it was having a good affect on my system ,I just felt good !. Till we chat again. Take care of U. Diane .      Im useless not sure if this is on private messages ..Durrr I will concentrate one these days or maybe e.mail if you prefer ?.  ",
