    "Content": "Hi everyone, I am really struggling with my post mastectomy arm exercises. My arm and shoulder is quite painful and I don't have a full range of movement. I had my surgery 3 weeks ago and have already been to my radiotherapy planning meeting. I found this difficult & painful as I struggled to raise my arm to required height. Would anyone have any advice to help me complete my exercises as I am really struggling to complete them and have only 3 more weeks before my radiotherapy begins XÂ ",
