      "Content": "Hi Can you describe the symptoms of breast lymphodema please? I had wle plus lymph clearance in Feb last year, followed by chemo then rads which finished at the end of Aug - it wasn't until early Dec that I noticed swelling in the affected breast. When I wake in the morning my breast is swollen on the underside with a slight orange peel texture to the skin and tender to touch however,  in the evening when I take off my bra, the symptoms are hardly noticeable. My BCnurse told me this is to be expected and all normal so soon after radiotherapy - I'm thinking it is the start of breast lymphodema and my bra is directing the lymphatic fluid into the right places but when not wearing one, it seems to be pooling into the underside of my breast - does this sound familiar?

      "Content": "Hi Nikki  I know exactly how you are feeling and please trust me that I promise you things will get better once your treatment is in place. I was diagnosed with grade 3 breast cancer in Jan last year, happily married aged 39 with two boys aged 2 & 9 and I felt exactly how you have described feeling too, it came out of the blue, no family history and is truly terrifying. If I could have this time back, I really wish that I hadn't wasted so much time and energy being scared but I know that's easier said than done. After biopsy, I was also told that it was in several nodes and had to have CT & MRI scans too which were thankfully clear.   Following lumpectomy and removal of 11 lymph nodes it was found that tiny cells (micromets) were found in just 1 node & the others were clear. Fast forward to now ... following surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy, I am sat here on holiday on the beach in Florida with my husband watching my son's playing in the ocean, oh and I even thave a cute hair style too! (: You will receive amazing support here, I couldn't have got through everything without it, be kind to yourself ...  ((BIG HUGS))",

I had a drain for 7days which collected the lymphatic fluid and since removal, I have not had any build-up of fluid. I have been doing the exercises daily which have really helped, I can already reach with my arm straight above my head, really pleased with my progress :)  I started driving 12days post op - only to my local supermarket - I guess as my op was on my right side it made things easier to be able to use my 'good' arm to change gear.
