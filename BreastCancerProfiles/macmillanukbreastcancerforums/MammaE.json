    "Content": "Hi Jamichri, I finished 15 rounds of radiotherapy at the end of October. The therapy itself is painless and your only in for a short session at time. You will most likely get a schedule of dates and times and for me I chose a time of day that suits best. As mentioned by someone else on this thread it depends on how far from hospital you are as it's a tiring routine to and from every day. Hope that helps and all goes well. xÂ ",
