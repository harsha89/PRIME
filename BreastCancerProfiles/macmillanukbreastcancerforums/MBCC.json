    "Content": "JustinB Hello all, I have stage 4 NHLymphoma, low-grade. Last night my wife expressed some concern over my left nipple which reverted around two weeks. I've also had a lot of chest pain beneath my left breast which I've ignored after an ECG showed it isn't my heart. My nipple is also tickles/itches in an uncomfortable way. I guess I'd like to ask you guys if you believe this is cause for worry and needs a visit to my GP? Many thanks for any advice offered, Jai. Hi Jai, yes, please take the inverted nipple seriously. Men do get breast cancer and all of the symptoms you mentioned are of concern.Â ",
