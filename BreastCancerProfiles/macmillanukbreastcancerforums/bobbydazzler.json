      "Content": "Lol!!  Well, poems, believe it or not I don't possess either an MP3 or an iPod, unlike my 73 year-old mum!!  If I'm cooking, I generally just take my laptop and headphones into the kitchen and do YouTube, but I should look at getting an iPod for when I'm in hospital.  The Hospicom system at our hospital is rubbish, it's always breaking down so you're left with no telly, radio or internet and it costs a fortune x",

      "Content": " Hi All Been a week today since my diagnosis and I'm feeling a bit weird.  Had a walk up to the cafe in the village to meet my friend for breakfast, which was fine as I'm in company and distracted.  Tomorrow I'm having a ladies cocktail lunch in town with more friends which I'm really looking forward to, again because it takes my mind off things and we always have a good laugh.  I've never minded my own company, but today since I got in from my breakfast date, I've been having panicky feelings, thudding heart, trembles, sweats, pins and needles etc which is horrible.  I've got things to do such as hang out laundry, wash-up, get the stuff together to cook dinner etc. but I just can't get motivated.  I can't even concentrate sufficiently to read the paper, my brain's everywhere!  Thank goodness for the telly and my laptop otherwise I think I'd be gnawing the coffee table by now!  I can't wait for my partner to get home from work so I can have a normal conversation rather than having cancer, cancer, cancer popping into my head every five minutes. Actually, having typed this and got it off my chest (oh dear, probably not the best phrase to use in a breast cancer forum!), I do feel much better than I did earlier.  Sorry for moaning, thanks for reading and have as great a day as you can x",

      "Content": "Hi Ladies Thanks for your replies and I'm glad to know I'm not going off my rocker!  My diagnosis was breast cancer, having a mastectomy and reconstruction at the end of this month. Have got my act together slightly and have actually washed up, switched the oven on and got the poussins out of the fridge ..... wow ..... lol!!  I might even get organised enough to go up the garden to get some thyme .... but not until Come Dine With Me's finished, got to get my priorities right! Thanks for your advice and the very best of British, Yvonne, for your op tomorrow, I hope all goes well for you and that you'll be home very soon x",
