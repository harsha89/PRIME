      "Content": "Hi I had grade 3 and it was only in one lymph node. I had chemo and rads. It was explained to me that chemo is a whole body treatment and recommended to reduce the risk of returning cancer or secondaries elsewhere. I had a pict line put in which meant the process was easier on my veins, having the actual chemo took about 90 mins from walking in to out I had 6 lots in 3 week cycles and it was all outpatient. It's scary but if you listen and follow advice there's a lot of good management of side effects. We are all individuals but ask to talk to people who are on it to help you decide. The rads works differently and is localised. I asked about what each treatment did to reduce risk and used a Web tool with my oncologist called predict to help me understand. It's a big decision so take information where you. I saw the 18 weeks in chemo as an investment in a longer future but it's hard going, good luck",

      "Content": "I start Fec next week. Like you my lump was a grade 3,  and I had hoped the wide excision radiotherapy and tamoxifen would be it. It reached one lymph node but not the further 4 they took out. my oncologist showed me a tool on line called predict. it shows the statistical profile of me being alive and cancer free in 10 years with no further treatments. we then layered on the treatments. The chemo then became a no brainer. I am a novice at web support groups but you have to understand your own personal reasons for taking the chemo. it sounds like you need a conversation with your oncologist to understand what a difference it makes to your situation. i wish you well. By this time next week i will have it all in my system and will probably understand more how you feel. ",

      "Content": "Hi I asked my doctor the day I had my mamo ultrasound and biopsy, in his experience what did he think. He told me it was quite likely to be cancer and it was. It really was the biopsy that gave the details of type and grade which enabled the treatment plan to be tailored. Its not nice waiting try to stay busy I' m a year past it now and just got a clear mammogram which took 10 days!",

      "Content": "I had fec t and recognised that in first few days sweat and urine had a different smell. I bought in all sorts of drinks to temp me as I went of my beloved tea (my kids call me tea belly. Some of the drugs for sickness also work by making you hold water. I tried to drink a lot and as the days moved on that was harder  I got thrush by day 5. I could only taste salt and sweet till about day 10. I made myself barley water which is easy and also found ice lollys helped, R whites lemonade ones were favourites. Every night I would take a pint of no sugar squash. I also found mint tea drinkable. It's good to experiment a bit with different drinks some will appeal some days  Good luck, manage your side effects proactively  with all the help you can get from the hospital, the tablets and medicines make a difference. I used to write on the boxes what to take when it gets confusing on bad days. Take care ",

      "Content": "Hi I had 20 sessions of radiotherapy in the height of summer and was worried about smell. The nurses gave me advice and I washed/showered twice a day using e45 shower lotion and then applied aqueaous cream. I cant spell the cream stuff put you can also use it to wash too, its very cheap.  I could smell sweat straight after treatment but I think that's because I got nervous and have been having flushes. Both these products are emoillient and keep the skin moisturised. I also made sure I only had natural fabric like cotton next to my skin which I washed at high temperatures in non bio to kill bacteria. I was basically trying to keep everything artificiai away from the skin but keep it clean. I'm 5 weeks past the Radio now and when it finished  I went to Holland and Barret for the purest Aloe vera and coconut oil products, an alternative therapist suggested this and I checked with my doctors - both were soothing and my skin is now close to the other side in colour and texture. Using them makes me feel a bit more girly. good look Tracey ",

      "Content": "i think that we can say anything on these forums, there should be no guilt about \"selfish\" feelings. its a shock that takes us all in different ways. One of my hardest days before the operation was buying a dress for my 11 year old daughter, it was in the period when i didnt know it was cancer. She wanted a black dress that cost £50 and made an innocent throw away comment that it would be somethng for funerals. Sounds an odd comment seeing as she has been to one funeral 3 years ago. It tipped me over the edge for a few days but I can honestly say that once i had my surgery i felt i had done something possitive to increase my chances of seeing her grow up. I am in week one chemo now and although i have some side effects am seeing all the treatment as an investment in the future. Its hard and i do cry but i have also been trying to let my family look after me for a change. Dont beat yourself up about any feelings and try to see something good in every day. its a rollercoaster but you can get through it t  ",

      "Content": "Hi I'm a year down the line lopsided and no nipple. I don't think you ever get used to it. I had chemo because of lymph spread and radio ended in august. I'm still sore which is why I came on line today and in dilemma about reconstruction I've learned not to hide feelings from people I love. Your children are young adults and your allies in the world. I have a 12 year old and was worried how she would be. She said the most wonderful thing to me when I had no hair eyelashes gone too and was living through chemo. She told me I was like a caterpillar and in time I would be beautiful again and fly. I'm not flying yet but am slowly building up strength. I was lucky to go on a 3 week holiday to India before Christmas and saw people in situations that made me humble. I am glad I can get away with most of my pre cancer cleavage clothes I've not lost all the breast. As for no nipple I was told I have to wait a year after radio, it gives you time to think it through. My husband wants me to have surgery and get back to the 36 c both sides but I'm not sure I want more surgery or an implant. I don't like what the cancer has done to me but it's made me count some blessings. My children have both coped amazingly and grown in independence and confidence through supporting me each other. Give yourself time and talk to other survivors about your options.",

      "Content": "Hard though it is try to see the surgery as a positive action.  I have talked to a few people who are years down the line after reconstruction and thats helped me think towards life past cancer. The chemo so far is better than i thought. I have been learning to show my husband especially that i am not invincible on this journey. I am am generally capable of organising everyone and doing loads. For years our children have joked about me. Their nickname for me is Bree Vandercamp!  my surgery was dec18th and we reached an agreement with it being so close to Christmas that anything i did was a choice for me and a bonus for others. My house is not as clean as it was but everyone seems to do their bit. The thing they want me to do is cook and its the thing i enjoy doing because i know they dont like Dads offerings. We had some funny family situations early on where i have got away with not eating his meals because i could say i was not so good. They sneak little comments to me like, be glad when you are better. We have tried to keep a very open conversation in the family, almost a banter. I will never forget the moment it sank in for my daughter that i will lose my hair. Her exclamation made us all laugh, text speak. 'OMG I'm going to have 2 bald parents', her elder brother quick as a flash was back with yes but at least mum can wear a wig. She has been helping me choose the wig which was fun. Crying is good for us to release our feelings. Share feelings, explore them and laugh when you can. I can go from one to the other. None of us know how we will feel, there is no right or wrong. You dont mention when you are having surgery? post how you are............",
