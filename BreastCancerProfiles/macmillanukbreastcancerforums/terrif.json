    "Content": "Hi, I am also at the Marsden in Sutton and your post could have written by me four weeks ago. I have today had my second chemo, six left then surgery then radiotherapy. Its scary but as you say the staff are fabulous. Waiting for the first chemo was a bit scary because its going into the unknown but it wasn't so bad, a few rough days after but not as bad as I expected. I feel better today after the second, maybe because I understand more what will happen though I know it could be different again. I lost my hair over the weekend but it will grow back - one day. Can't bring myself to wear a wig though I have one, if you haven't already done so ask for an appointment with Paul, the hospital hairdresser, he will help you choose a NHS wig (he has many to choose from) or if you prefer he will direct you to somewhere outside the hospital. He was the only one to tell me what to look for as a warning that the fall out was going to start. Also talk to your nurse. I called mine and asked to talk because at the first meeting I was still in shock and not really taking anything in, I also wanted to meet her on my own so that I could say what I wanted without worrying upsetting or worrying those who were with me. She was fabulous. Last thing - if you haven't already done so buy an annual parking ticket, it will save you a lot of money, it costs Â£100 but mine has paid for itself already. You will get through this, try be open minded and try not to listen to horror stories about how awful you will feel, everyone is different so no-one can say how bad chemo it will be for you. Stay in touch and stay positive - we're going to have a shit year but then it will be over and life will go on - for both of us. Terri x",
