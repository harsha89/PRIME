    "Content": "Your doctor sounds brilliant, though it must have been pretty tedious to have your partner constantly asking if you were going to have your boob chopped off. She seems to have handled it really well and the news that they wouldn't perform a mastectomy without your prior knowledge is good. My Mum just came round without her breast having not been told what they were going to do - that was some years ago though. I had IDC 12mm Grade 2 which should have been pretty straightforward so I was told. Unfortunately i had an infection and an abscess burst - very messy and painful, also part of the cancer was left behind so I had to have another operation to remove the bit left behind and repair the wound - a great gaping hole at the time. Anyway, have just finished radiotherapy and found my boob looks like a mangled squashed tomato now! Have been fine and very cheerful so far but woke up this morning in tears. I'm single, divorced and living alone though have two grown up daughters and three  grandkids. I may be getting on and I'm also physically disabled but I've never ruled out the hope that I might have another relationship some day. Then I thought, its impossible now that anyone could ever want to make love to me - my Mum had my Dad who was very supportive but how do single women cope with such things. I know I haven't had a mastectomy but there isn't a lot left after all the surgery and it looks dreadful. I expect I'll be busy and happily rushing around as usual soon though - but this morning I think I grieved for what I have lost. I hope that doesn't sound too horribly self-pitying, I know that I'm really one of the lucky ones, the cancer was caught fairly early. Has anyone else had this grieving experience? ",
