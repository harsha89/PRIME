I have had one Herceptin jab, whilst nothing like the side effects of chemo I do feel very achy, just wondered if you have had any side effects from the jab.. also are you starting Lethrozole, I am due to start after my Radiotherapy and wanted to know what to expect. Thanks",

      "Content": "Hi Could you tell me how you found out whether your cancer was \u2018curable\u2019 or \u2018treatable\u2019.  I have recently finished radiotherapy, having had Chemo and a mascetomy. I was diagnosed last summer with Multifocal breast cancer, grade 3 HER2. My radiotherapy was also to my chest wall, Axilla and SCF. I suppose I just assumed this treatment was curing...seeing the post from sazzat I now wondering if I should be asking  Any advice would be great Thanks",
