The oncologist at Addenbrookes was great and gave me so much information, he said that in America they do not go onto chemo or radio unless 4 nodes are cancerous. So I was given the choice. He also told me that , have asked for the full path results, the M1 that I showed indicated that my cancerous cells do not double very fast- very indolent( his phrase). I decided not to have chemo and go straight onto tablets. He then told me I will need to take Letrozole for 2 years and then tomoxifen for 8 years. His view was that it reduces the side effects by changing half way. I am no expert and am working my way through the path report to understand it- but I am glad I have it.. I know exactly how you feel I said the same thing when I went in. GOOD LUCK- Iwill be thinking of you Lynne",

      "Content": "Hi Tracey, Totally agree, I found my lump when examining my breasts after a clear mammogram last year, it had obviously been growing slowing(2) for some time.  But I would also put a warning on ultrasound. My first ultrasound I was told that it was probably an infection and given a week on antibiotics. Luckily when I returned another one of the team did another ultrasound  and then a deep biopsy, and found the cancer. I think it depends on the person doing the ultrasound. Thankfully since then I have had brilliant care. By the way those surgeons have a funny way of expressing things. When I was first told I needed a lumpectomy( since changed to msx) he likened it to an apple corer- as it is on the nipple- only a man could do that, ouch! M Lynne",

      "Content": "I had  mastectomy with latissimo dorsi reconstruction on 26th August. I found it difficult in the first couple of days to put on  bras without hooks.  found it easier to hook round the front and then turn it round. However after I got home I was finding a big problem with  night time- I would turn in my sleep and my breast would follow!! because it was a bit swollen- I would wake up suddenly. However I got some stretchy ones from Sainsbury's would you believe- only tried that because the friend who was driving me around wanted to go there- they have been excellent and have given me great help at night.  I was also fine going home with a bra on. Putting on PJ bottoms were not a problem at all - and the hospital ( Addenbrookes) had a lovely array of pretty bags to put my drains in- so that was good. Apparently they are made by a friend of one of the nurses. Good luck- hope everything goes as well as mine seems to have done. Only downer is that I have to go back for lymph removal next week which I am not looking forward to. MLynne",
