I had a clear bone scan 6 months ago and my consultant has ordered another one but probably won't have it until after Xmas.  Don't know how I'll cope until then.  I'm convinced it's now everywhere!!!  I've been told anastrozole can give joint pain but has anyone had back and shoulder pains while on this that doesn't involve joints?  Sorry for the disjointed ramble!!!!

      "Content": "Hi I just had my first FEC T session 25th April.  I was dreading it!!  Like everyone says different people have different experiences.  It wasn't too bad, I was dreading the sickness.  I did have to get extra anti sickness tablets but they did work!  Uncomfortable dry mouth and funny taste.  I found it although not pleasant doable.  I have 5 more cycles to go I hope the rest of them are similar. Good luck and though it's hard try not to worry too much. Winney",

      "Content": "Thanks so much Karen.  I've been put on Enalapril Mateate tablets 2.5mg for 10-14 days and if my blood pressure, kidney function etc is normal then it's to be upped to 5mg.  You're going to think I'm a woose but I don't know if my HER2 was +++ or low amplification as I'm afraid to ask.  All I know is I'm ER and HR2 positive I didn't ask and they didn't say.  I'm afraid of being told something I don't want to hear!!!!!  Does it impact on either your prognosis or chances of reoccurrence?

Good to hear of your experience, I'm hoping it works out like that for me too. Thanks Sharon Winney. ",

I will try your tip hopefully it\u2019ll do the trick.  When diagnosed with cancer it\u2019s a whole new ball game.  Nothing seems to be clear cut or answers straight away. Thanks again  Winney",

      "Content": "Hi, I've had my 13th Herceptin injection and got a call to come into the hospital as my LV function had dropped to 45-50%.  They have put me on medication (I think an ACE inhibitor???) and deferred my last 5 Herceptin injections until hopefully heart function comes up again. Has anyone here had their Herceptin deferred because of low LV function and been able to finish their course of injections and does LV function always return to normal after treatment?  I never imagined this happening!

Banother scan in 12 weeks.  I just wanted to ask if anyone else had experience of additional lung nodes which turned out not to cancerous.  Fingers crossed!!! Thanks  Winney ",
