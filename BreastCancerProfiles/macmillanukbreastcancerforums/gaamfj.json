    "Content": "Hi, My mum was recently diagnosed with breast cancer and had a lumpectomy last month.  Unfortunately, there was a sign of cancer in a few of the lymph nodes so further treatment is required.   She has been given the choice between radio or chemo.  The nurses have said it is 50/50 what one to go for so she has a major dilemma.  The pros/cons she has been told off are : Chemo Aggressive, will take longer, has worse side effects etc Radio + hormone Cancer may come back in x years time and if so, will come back more aggressive and likely to spread quicker. Has anyone else been in the same situation and could offer some advice as to which option they went for and why? Thanks, Andy",
