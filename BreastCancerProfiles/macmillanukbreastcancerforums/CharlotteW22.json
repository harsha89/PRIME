    "Content": "Hello Isingbass! I hope you are ok, i just saw this thread and had to post! i am BRCA1 and 26 years old. i as a preventative measure had both breasts removed and reconstructed a few months ago. I have found the whole experience a huge life changing one but i have been left with two good looking breasts. All the leaflets and different opinions you get i know is harrowing!  I had my breasts reconstructed with implants and then secured my strattice which is like a mesh and from pigs (yuk) Theres lots of photos on forums and Facebook support groups i could point you in the right direction if you wanted to have a look? and of course would be happy to show you mine.  I hope you are doing ok, heres my blog which i started a few days after my op its very real and has lots of pics which may help you  charleys blog mastectomy xx",
