      "Content": "In the next few weeks I am facing mastectomy with ( hopefully) immediate reconstruction. I was offered TUG flap reconstruction. Ive read a lot about it but would really want to learn about other people's experience. Until recent I've always been very healthy, so being diagnosed with HER2 positive carcinoma & DCIS has been a massive shock to me. I'm absolutely terrified & would really appreciate if people could share their reconstruction stories with me. ",

      "Content": "The chemo is over for me. It was relatively easy, all side effects very mild.  I've convinced myself that my cancer & DCIS Will shrink to the point of breast conserving surgery & I really have to be strong through chemo to achieve my goal. I even managed to work out through the whole thing. Unfortunately I am where I am today & after 8 sessions of chemo & mastectomy, reconstruction & radio looming over I feel totally exhausted phisically & emotionally.  I had to wear extra large cold cap & it was very snug. It gave me some horrific headaches but my hair is is better than before ( no peroxide for 6 months)! ",

      "Content": "Jansue,  Thanks for your reply.  I've already completed my chemo, which was a breeze. I've opted for cold cap & it saved all my hair, it has grown infact. I've always tolerated drugs really well & was hoping that chemo will save my breast. Unfortunately it hasn't worked out, my tumour has shrunk but the DCIS is still there.  I'm scared of what my body will be like post op, will I be disable or less able phisically? Will I have any sensation in my new breast or is it completely numb?  Thanks ",
