      "Content": "Hi Jacmatholmad Loved the photo.  You must look forward to a little me time on Sunday'! As far as your journey goes, just take it one day at a time and try and not think too far ahead.  You don't really know what's going to happen and how you're going to feel til that day comes.  No point in worrying about what might happen.   If you have a bad day, be sure that tomorrow will be better.  My chemo and radiotherapy ended in June last year and I've just got back to work part time.  Most days are good but some days I get tired or I can't sleep.  My appetite though has improved and I'm putting weight on which I'm so pleased about as I was only 7st throughout my treatment.  Be sure you will get through this even though there are times when you'll feel very alone, just talk to someone and it's amazing how much better you'll feel xx",

      "Content": "Hi.  I never walked much before breast cancer but after finishing my treatments in June last year and following a few months of doing nothing, in October I started walking 1.5 miles every other day.  I've steadily increased this by half a mile a month and am enjoying walking 4 miles every day now.  Last December i decided to do the 10k Race for Life 2018 so i've got something to aim for.  I cant walk 10k yet but I should be able to by June.  It's all about pacing yourself and a big of a challenge now is nothing compared to what we've already been through!  Walking is enjoyable - even better in the summer - but it's also a good way of building stamina up without pushing yourself too far.  There are days when fatigue hits me before I get home and i have to find somewhere to sit down for 10-15 mins to get my breath back and find my legs again.  But then I can get up and start again!  Everyone is different.  You have to find your own way of getting back to 'normal'.",

      "Content": "Hi ladies It' brilliant to see so many people going through a similar journey and giving eachother so much encouragement to get out there.  I didn't get out yesterday as it was raining and I had housework to do and my sciatica was playing games with me so I thought I'd have a day off!  Well I wish I hadn't.  My back and legs are so stiff, my sciatica jolted me afew times and my fatigue kicked in so I was out of breathe but hardly moving forward!  But I know that you were all pushing me on and I got my 4 miles done so thank you.  Unfortunately my views aren't as beautiful as some of the pics posted on here but I can pretend x",
