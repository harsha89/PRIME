      "Content": "Hi Youngatheart treatment is going well, thanks. Halfway through as of today! :-) Only got a slightly pinker boob so far, but am really tired. I\u2019m a space cadet for around an hour after zapping, then pick up. I can still get a good 5k walk in of an afternoon (but would prefer to sleep!) have you started now, I can\u2019t find the post with your start date on, sorry.  xx",

      "Content": "Those tattoos are a nightmare huh?! The one on my right side (the first one inflicted!!) hurt so much, the others weren\u2019t as bad. Don\u2019t know what the lovely lady did to me, but it ended up with no ink & I had to have it redone! Nowhere near so painful. I do wonder whether the pain is user technique related.  Good luck! X",
