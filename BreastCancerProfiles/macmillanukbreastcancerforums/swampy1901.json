      "Content": "It has to be worth a try - if your daughter finds it too uncomfortable then at least she will have tried it. It all depends how much keeping her hair is important to her. In my case because I wear hearing aids - I wanted to keep my own hair for as long as possible. I have had three sessions of cold capping with three to go. Yes my hair has gone thin (very thin in my eyes!!) but family say it looks fine to them but if needs be I have my wig if at any point I feel I need it. Because of the gradual hair loss I have become more receptive to wearing the wig whereas prior to that I was ready to hide under the duvet for the duration of the treatment . As your daughter moves through the treatment regime she will most likely find that her attitude to how she feels about things such as her hair for example may well change and it may not be such a big issue in the future. I recently attended a LGFB session and the attitude of some of the ladies was amazing!! Good Luck",

      "Content": "Cold capping is hard but so so worth it if you can stick it out. Take painkillers an hour before you are due to cold cap, wear layers to keep warm and have plenty of hot drinks to hand, occupy your mind with music or a difficult crossword puzzle or sudoku to distract you for the first 10 to 20 minutes after which you should be used to it and able to cope. Also wear a stretchy headband to prevent the cold cap being right up close to your forehead and make sure that your hair is wet before adding conditioner to your hair and applying the cold cap.  It can be hard going at times - I struggled but persevered along with my chemo buddy either my husband or daughter to talk to me or distract me when it was particularly difficult. Hang in there and sending you lots of hugs and encouragement Swampy",

      "Content": "Hi Mandy I'm pleased with results after cold capping I probably lost 40-50% of my hair and in places it was really thin or almost bald but nothing that couldn't be covered up with a bit of strategic combing or moving the parting. But it started to grow back while I was on the Taxotere so for me it wasn't so harsh compared to FEC. Now shock horror!! I did dry my hair and on occasion straightened it!! But I was extremely gentle with everything I did towards my hair. I air-dried as much as possible and then finished off styling with the hairdryer on a very cool setting. I washed my hair no more than once or twice a week and in between times used a dry shampoo. For me not styling my hair was a no no so hence my very careful handling. Luckily!! for me I had the majority of my chemo in the winter months so a woolly hat did a good cover up at times when I was desperate not to mention cold!! lol!! I have not coloured my hair since before my treatment and now I probably won't bother but my hair is growing back a mixture of brown and grey but it is actually a really nice muted colour at the moment so I'm now growing out the rest of the old colour and will see how it looks in a few months time.  If it works for you then cold capping is a definite bonus as you will feel relatively normal as your hair is still your own - but that's not to say I didn't wear my wig - I did but only about 3 or 4 times. So you wanted a positive note - just the fact you are trying the cold cap is a good thing and if you are successful then re-growth should be fairly quick when all your treatment is finished. It is hard while doing it but at least you are giving it a whirl!! Swampy",

Jot down all the questions that you want to ask and if you don't understand something ask them to tell you again and take someone with you for support and to help you ask questions. I ended up with the DIEP but that had already been virtually decided by my Breast Surgeon and myself. She had already gone through all the options and then she asked me for my gut reaction which was for the DIEP. This was influenced by the fact I was very likely to need radiotherapy - Implants don't do well with RT, DIEPs can suffer too but not to the degree that implants could. Plus if you are the donor to yourself there is less chance of rejection (at least that was my argument) and the surgeon agreed with me.  Following my SNB and DIEP I now am booked to see the oncologist so my original treatment plan is open to change possibly - ANC then chemo or not. Everyone is different and everyone has a different treatment plan. I found the pack given to me by my BCN from the MacMillan Nurses really useful to read with suggested questions to ask - you can download these too I think.  As for the surgeons - their line of work is to cut things out - pure and simple! If they need reminding of the fact that they are going to operate on a 49 year old woman who has concerns and feelings then don't be afraid to say so. At 55 - I've been described as young - you are a positive spring chicken in comparison to me!! lol!! Swampyx",

      "Content": "Hi SpicedTea I am three weeks post operative now but unfortunately had a minor setback in that I had a haematoma which was drained but then compromised part of the tummy wound. It was just one of those things. Not anything I or anyone did wrong but has slowed down the recovery process. It has resulted in me having the wound packed and dressed either by the hospital or the district nurses for the past 10 days or so. I ended up in Urgent Care on Friday evening having the wound inspected again because of pain and redness which was then treated with antibiotics. I'm due to see the surgeon on Thursday but the staff nurse has already requested a negative pressure vac to try and improve the recovery process. Where the wound has healed well I'm told it's spot on and a lovely neat job!  The new boob is great- warm and feels huge compared to its mate - a little numb in places and ticklish in others - but the surgeon put in more than was taken out as she felt that when it all settles down that there will be no need for a reduction on the other side to match up. Great news - as far as I am concerned - just a tattoo or nipple construction on the new boob at a later date if I want it.  So the tummy is frustrating stuff at the moment but small fry now that I've had the results from the op and am now due to see the oncologist tomorrow for information and statistics on what treatment plan to follow next whether ANC, RT, chemo or whatever - we'll see. I'm glad that you had a good outcome from your appointment and that you are much happier with the whole set up now. It all feels so much better when you feel are in control of how things move forward and have input into the right treatment for you. Swampy",

      "Content": "Hi London You sound like you need a lot of TLC right now! Ask for counselling or referral to your local Hospice or whatever the equivalent is in your area. My local Hospice has a monthly group for us women to meet to chat and maybe do an activity such as Tai Chi, Crafts etc - and they always treat us with a little tea of delicious foods. It is so good to chat to other women who will understand exactly how you are feeling when you don't want to burden your family. In addition our hospice also offers treatments such as reflexology etc and you have a chance to chat to the therapist if you want to offload and in your case if managing your pain is a major issue they will be able to help. My district nurses referred me when I was feeling particularly down early on in my treatment - I spent weeks with a major abdominal wound that just wouldn't heal and it gave me a real pick up when I needed it. They have lifted my moods, dealt with my tears and fears - and this is what you need right now. Do push for help - we can all be strong and brave in front of family and friends - but sometimes we need someone who is totally removed from that circle to give us what we actually need. Hugs x",

I was walking to the car park with my daughter after the bombshell was dropped on me when she asked me if I wanted to talk about it, have time to digest it or not talk about it or whatever. I said talk about it and I was happy for people to pass on information - this made it easier all round. Family could pass on news without making me have to explain everything for the umpteenth time. Work colleagues were the same and keep in touch with me via emails, fb and text messages and if they had an update would pass on the info to others re chemo etc so they could time visits for my best days. It is all about what is most comfortable for you - some people are private and don't want all and sundry to know their business. But if people know some of what has recently happened then you only need to update the latest news.  Do what feels right for you.",

Every relationship is different - in our relationship - I deal with all the financial stuff but he gets told about what's going on - I set everything up before I went in for my operation 10 days ago and told him what money was available and where etc etc. Bills are all paid until I can deal with it all again and in effect - we agreed no alternative or large expenditures while all this is going on. In essence this is easy as I have sick pay from work and he works too but I'm well aware that not everyone has this luxury.  Are you claiming whatever benefits you are entitled to?

      "Content": "I think you should ask for second opinion or ask to meet with another member of your MDT team. I was diagnosed with DCIS which was invasive after biopsy. I had a mastectomy with immediate reconstruction and sentinel node biopsy. The SNB came back with one of two nodes fully encapsulated. My BCN admitted to be flabbergasted by the result as it was totally unexpected but it meant a discussion with my Breast surgeon who admitted that as a surgeon - they like to cut things out!! But she sent me to see the oncologist for some statistics. The oncologist gave me a load of statistics and recommended that I went for chemo as he felt that even though the operation was successful in clearing everything out - he was of the opinion that cancer could be on the move or hidden in my little toe. He felt that the chemo would sort out any critters (if there were any) in the axillary nodes and radiotherapy would act as insurance thus eliminating in his opinion any need for another operation for clearance. This considerably reduced the risk for lymphodema but it is not a guarantee as this can strike anytime - even years after your operation. The radiotherapy did affect my reconstruction but this will be put right by the plastic surgeon next year - but in the meantime I'm seeing a physiotherapist to get my arm/shoulder to get things moving properly as the radiotherapy has reduced the new breast and affected the chest wall muscle too. We have hundreds of lymph nodes so your lymph system will still function - to be honest apart from the limited arm movement - I have not noticed any untoward swelling. Ultimately my oncologist said the difference between the two treatments statistically was very similar so it really a matter of what you feel happier with. Just something else to consider is - depending on the area in which you live - it is the norm to do a full clearance if more than ' x ' amount of nodes have been affected by cancer - so something else to ask your oncologist. I do hope you can come to a decision you can happily live with.",
