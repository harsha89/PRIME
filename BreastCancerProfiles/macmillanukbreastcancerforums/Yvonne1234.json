    "Content": "Hi Not sure if I am doing this correctly but here we go. I was diagnosed with breast cancer end of last month and just did what the doctors advised. I had surgery 2 weeks ago to have the cancer (hopefully all) removed and the lymph nodes taken out.  My McMillan nurse advised that when surgery was done I would have like a star fish effect when stitched up (this would go on to create a new nipple later on if I wanted reconstruction) to my horror the cut literally goes right across my breast from side to side (not worried about scar under my armpit). Could this mean that they didn't get it all? have they  just stitched it across as there is no point attempting to make it look ok as I will need more surgery (I wasn't initially concerned about this but I dreamt last night that this was the reason and it is now just going round and round in my head If I need more surgery I can handle that I just don't like surprises (if I'm going to be emotional I would rather do it alone and not in front of people which is what happens when I get surprises)",
