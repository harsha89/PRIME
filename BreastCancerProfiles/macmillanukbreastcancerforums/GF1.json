      "Content": "Hi Hester Thanks for you reply have never tried remedies from a homeopath but any thing is worth a go!! I have already had FEC and suffered nausea but no pain there is a lot of different tablets they can give you for the sickness and nausea so just ask for them. Now I am on the T it seems that the FEC was a lot easier to handle! Good luck with the rest of your treatment GF1",
