    "Content": "Since my diagnosis in April 2016 where I had 6 x chemo, surgery and finished with 25 radiotherapy sessions, I\u2019m now on Tamoxifen for 10 whole lovely years (only 8 1/2 to go).  I have definitely noticed weight gain since this all started.  I have always eaten really healthly during the week and let go at the weekends, but noticed this wasn\u2019t doing anything anymore no matter what I did.  I have always excercised and was very aware that this may just be what I needed to do.  I joined my local gym and I can honestly say that in the last 6 weeks where I have done (and this is the honest truth) 42 spinning classes this being 7 every week and 20 Pilates classes and not a dicky bird.  Now I know that I won\u2019t burn calories with Pilates I do it for my back, but the spinning classes?.... I would have expected something.  Yes my legs feel amazing and I feel less bulky but that\u2019s about it.  I\u2019m eating organic food and drink as much as possible and this is because I kept thinking at Christmas that if a normal sprout is now the size of a small cabbage compared to an organic sprout which is the size of the sprouts I remember as a child, you know.. normal sprout size not the size of s golf ball what is going into them  to make them that big?  What is going into normal foods to make them last so long.  I don\u2019t know about anyone else but I\u2019m up for reducing the chemicals/pesticides I put on my body.   Don\u2019t get me wrong I still eat normal food too because organic is expensive  and not everything is available in an organic option. I do have the odd glass of red wine but even that is organic.  So I don\u2019t know what the answer is.  It\u2019s frustrating cause I am shifting heaven and earth to burn the Calories off but even the High Intensity Interval Training that spinning is and it  is supposed to have the  most effective fat burning benefits of any excercise, it\u2019s not really doing that much as yet.  Maybe I need to give it more time 6 weeks isn\u2019t that long I know. I would love to know if anyone had any other suggestions?  It\u2019s tough going this weight loss milarchy. ",
