      "Content": "I read these comments with interest! I'm on tamoxifen and went to my GP 3 weeks with a list of questions I was worried about. The bone scan being one of them. She told me that they don't do bone scans as it's not on their list! Terrific!! So do I now keep quiet or speak to a different GP? There seems to be a lot of different advice given and I worry that I'm being forgotten!!",

      "Content": "Hi dreamthief, Thanks for advice. I didn't specify which bone scan as don't know anything about either!! It's just I have read threads on here about them and other things and basically since my initial check up after my op ( mastectomy with reconstruction ) and my yearly check up at the hospital I haven't had any dealings or advice from any of the professionals!! I assumed it was because I was lucky enough not to have Chemo or radiotherapy. It's something I have worried about for months and eventually went to GP with my list of questions but she told me if I needed any further tests etc the hospital would have informed her!!! I also asked about a yearly liver function blood test as it's recommended on the the tamoxifen leaflet but again she said it's not something they offer but if I wanted it I could have it done. As yet I haven't as I thought if I needed it they would tell me, don't want to come across as a hypercondriac!!! Not sure if I'm just burying my head in the sand!! I personally have no faith in my dedicated breast cancer nurse so I don't want to talk to her. The surgical team were good but the rest of it was rubbish!! I certainly won't be having another operation at that hospital!!! Anyway thanks for your advice, really appreciate it",

I take it after breakfast as had read that it can cause nausea so best taken with food! Who really knows!!!! Trial and error!! nuttymare",

I was also really low but put it down to everything I'd been through! Perhaps I'm not mad after all!!!! I've now been on tamoxifen for 14 months and will continue taking it for piece of mind",

It gets on my bloody nerves but I wouldn't stop taking it. I really turned a corner emotionally about a month ago, so if you can persevere you may well start feeling better. Hope this helps a bit xx",

I asked my nurse why I needed to take tamoxifen if they got rid of all the cancer, the nurse said they can't guarantee they have removed every cell and to protect my 'good' boob!!!! Hope this helps a little.",
