      "Content": "Recently found what looks like an indent/shadow on my left reconstructed breast.Worried Sick as this is how my second breast cancer presented.Have contacted the BCN who has gave me an appointment for Wed 16th May at 10am.Have had IDC breast cancer twice,first time was in 2010 at age 32 resulting in bilateral mastectomy\u2019s with tram reconstruction.The second time was in 2015 age 37 which again presented as an indent/shadow under my right reconstructed breast.Had to have my right reconstructed breast removed completely.Both times recieving chemo,radio,herceptin and Tamoxifen and now on Anastrozole,So you can see why I\u2019m so worried.My mind is running away with thought like,what if it\u2019s back,could I cope with losing my hair again,chemo etc.....",
