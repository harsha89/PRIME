    "Content": "I had mammogram and called back for ultrasound when Fine Needle test and core biopsy was carried out on 1cm nodule. Needle test was clear but an appointment was made for following week to discuss results. Doctor told me they would ring with results Thursday or Friday and when no call came I rang breast care nurse to ask if I should keep my appointment or wait till i heard from doctor. She said results would never been done over the phone but if doctor had said they would ring then hadnt got all the results through. Beginning to worry that needle test has given a false negative. Can this happen?",
