      "Content": "Hi I had my first FEC chemo session on Wednesday and tonight have some red patches on my skin around where I had breast surgery and lymph nodes removed, can anyone suggest a suitable cream? would E 45 be Ok or would I need something special because of the drugs in me. Trying to join and post in the July chemo club but not sure if this will appear there hope so?, if not can anyone help as I can't seem to post direct in there?? Thanks Poppy",

Staying is loose clothes, no bra today!, so that there is no rubbing but all seems OK now but will keep an eye on it. Poppy xx",

      "Content": "Hi everyone I have obtained a copy of my pathology report for my employers critical illness plan and have just had wide local incision on breast with guide wires and lymph node removal of which first 6 nodes had cancer in them. I now have to have CT scan and then see oncologist re chemo. Does anyone know what HER 2 IHC 1 + (Negative) means??. I ask questions but get told all can be discussed as my oncology appointment which is in a different hospital and that I will have chemo and radiotherapy and then drug treatment. I only got diagnosed a month ago and have already had surgery and things are moving very fast and I keep being told what will happen next but I don't seem to be involved in making any decisions. Its as though one hospital has done their bit and I am being passed on to another not really knowing what will happen. Anyone else in this situation? would be grateful for any comments to put my mind at rest a bit. Thanks Poppy",

      "Content": "Thank you Dreamthief, I am not sure what future drug treatments are yet and why I need chemo if cancer has all been removed. I thought CT scan was to check the cancer has not travelled anywhere else as it was in the lymph nodes. I guess all will become clearer when I see the oncologist which is in a different hospital.  I am recovering from surgery and doing those exercises though!!!",

      "Content": "Hi I had my last chemo 3 weeks ago and the PICC line removed on the same day. I really thought I was going to pick up now and enjoy Christmas until this week when I have had loads of problems. My arm swelled and after going in and having a scan they discovered two blood clots but said it was unusual to have happened 3 weeks after the line was taken out. I am doing blood thinning injections but has anyone else experienced this and how long does it take for the clots to dissolve and for the swelling to subside. I keep asking the question at oncology but they won't commit and just say could be a while!!  Would be good to hear other peoples experiences.  Thanks Poppy",

      "Content": "Hi Cham I had my lumpectomy and 9 lymph nodes removed at the end of April and was only in pain for a few days after surgery, however, 2 months on and in the last 2 weeks or so like you I have developed a fair amount of pain, mostly stabbing and shooting pains in my breast and have been told this is due to the swelling from the operation and the numbness I had around the incisions having subsided and the nerves coming back to life!!  Apart from the pain I do not have the other symptoms you have of sweating and maybe you should go back and get this checked. Hope the pain gets better for you soon. Poppy  ",
