      "Content": "hi i had breast cancer when i was 41, i have a large family who i felt wernt there for me either annd you are so right it is a very lonely place. that was 14 years ago. and yes it never leaves you i had a macectomy with no chemo as they got it early and people did say i was lucky maybe i was but i didnt feel that if i was lucky i wouldnt have got it at all . it changed my life started going to beauticians to make me look better proberbly didnt but it felt good. as we speak my husband and daughter both have cancer my daughter is only 31 and she seemed to be coping really well with chemo hubby not so good so i had to spend so much time with him hospital everyday. they changed my daughters chemo half way through and we were told it was going to hace differant side effects one day i couldnt reach her by phone so phoned my grandaughter i said shell i come over i heard my daughter say no im ok to which my grandaughter replied well obviously not mum because you keep crying i went straight over and yes she was crying and her words hit me like a hammer she said ive never felt so lonely it broke my heart how the hell did i let that happen. she says its not my fault and the last thing she wants to to feel is like it was. things have changed now ive told my hubby she needs me as much as you and of course he understands i think sometimes if we keep telling people were ok thats greaat thats what they want to hear but tell them how you really feel i cant believe i got it so wrong but im so sorry i did. i wish i could turn back the clock butÂ  i cant i hope you find comfort on hear and im so sorry that you feel the way you do but it is a lonely place even with family and friends. sending you a big hug linda xx",
