      "Content": "Hi y'all, first post! Although it's not about me! My step-Mum had lumpectomy & axillary clearance in Nov 14, she's 75 bless her! Grade 3 with 9 of 15 lymph nodes cancerous. Saw the oncologist last Thursday with her and she doesn't know what to do about chemo and I don't know what to say to help. Like Sue60 said consultant bamboozled us a bit with statistics and computer software predicting about a 6% reduction in reoccurrence /secondary within 10 yr timeframe based on step-Mum's circumstances. But statistics and predictions are difficult info to process in relation to difficult decision of whether to have chemo, for anyone, let alone when you are 75. They said if she chooses chemo she will have 1 session every 3 weeks for 6 sessions. Don't know what chemo drug or if that makes a difference! She'll have a PICC line they said. They said if she was 30, they would defo strongly recommend, if 50 they would highly recommend but because she is 75, it is up to her.  She is understandably torn.  She realises the possibility of side effects, knows she would lose her hair, risk of blood clots but biggest worry from her is the knackered immune system and the chance of catching something because of that which could make her very ill or worse.  I've said to her there is no wrong decision and that she shouldn't feel guilty if she chooses not to have chemo. I think she wants someone to make the decision for her and I am being careful what I say to try to avoid influencing her decision.  Any advice?   Thank you x",

      "Content": "Thank you ladies for replying. It's nice to have reassurance to know what I'm doing to support is on the right track. She eems to be swaying between the two decisions depending on who she talks to but my feeling is she doesn't want to go with chemo.  Radiotherapy is strongly recommended regardless of her decision and she has defo decided to have that, she's also started the hormone therapy Letrozole.  I mentioned the notion to her that if she chose the chemo route that if things became horrid she could stop at any point, she hadn't thought of that.  Can you see a Macmillan nurse to talk things through before deciding or is the breast care nurses the ones to contact? My thoughts and best wishes for you all on your individual journeys - I do know how it feels as had womb cancer myself back in 2004, caught early at stage 1b, total hysterectomy & BSO but no chemo or radiotherapy thankfully.
