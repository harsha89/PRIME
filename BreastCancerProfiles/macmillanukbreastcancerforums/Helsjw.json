Saw gp earlier this year who dismissed it and told me to forget about it. Found 2 lumps 2 weeks ago and they turned out to be  simple cysts but this old original lump turned out to be the nasty.  Now worried about type, MRI, sentinel lode and everything else i could worry about. Slowly going mad.  Do keep in touch x x ",

Had proper meltdown last night but my husband and daughters put me back together again.  Met with my consultant this evening and my biopsy showed stage 1 which is the best it could have been. Cant believe I celebrated with a sherry after being told i have stage 1 BC. But it could have been worse.  I have an MRI scan next week and an appt to plan course of action on Wednesday but it is likely \u2018quick op\u2019 (my consultants words) followrd by hormone tablets and some radiotherapy.  Consultant doesnt seem too concerned and is sure i will be anle to go on holiday in october being fit and well.  What a few days......sending lots of love your way for your mum and you and let us know how it all goes xx",

One couldnt he found on ultrasound (1mm) and the other 3mm concern turned out to be Fibroadenoma.  After doing lots of reading it seems that Mri are infamous for showing false positives. My consultant said most occasions the mri will find something and in most occasions it turns out to be nothing of concern.  I understand how you feel entirely - i have an MRI scheduled for march next year as part of my 6 monthly follow up - this will pick up everything hopefully but i will need to be prepared for this and remind myself of the false positive rate.  Good luck x ",
