      "Content": "Hi, I've just joined this site.  I was diagnosed with breast cancer just before Christmas and have had an op to removed the lump and some lymph nodes 3 weeks ago.  Have been told I have to have another op in 3 weeks time as they need to removed some more tissue due to DCIS cells.  If that's successful I then have radiotherapy folloved by medication, if not then it's a mastectomy. I feel I'm lucky my cancer is Stage 1 low grade.  My surgeon seems to have very set ideas on what I should have done and I don't feel I'm being given any part in the decisions and it's difficult to know what questions to ask.  I've been given a prescription for Arimidex and am horrified at the common side effects.  I have been taking HRT for the past 8 years fully aware that it increased my chances of getting breast cancer, and happily accepted the risk as my quality of life was greatly improved. What I can't find out from the booklets or websites is - and I'd be very grateful if anyone can answer this question for me - Arimidex is given to prevent the recurrence of breast cancer.  If I elected to have a double mastectomy would I still need to take this hormone therapy? I would appreciate a response from anyone with experience or knowledge about this.  And send my love and best wishes to everyone out there. Lee",

      "Content": "Thank you very much for your reply. I feel as though I am being 'swept along' with what is happening and it's difficult to know what questions to ask.  I will definitely ask what the statistics are regarding taking Arimidex or not.  I have been on HRT for the past 8 years, fully aware that it would increase my risk of getting breast cancer but am strongly of the opinion that I want quality rather than quantity of life and have no regrets about the decision I made even though I now have breast cancer. This is probaby why I have accepted the fact without too much emotional upset and feel I can be as objective of making the next decision about taking medication when I know the full facts. Thank you once again and may I wish you all the very best luck for the future. Lee x",

      "Content": "Thank you Heather. I'm 60 years and the hot flushes have come back since stopping HRT 2 months ago. Just hope they don't get any worse now that I have started Arimidex.  I feel lucky my cancer is Grade 1 and I found it while it was quite small.  One advantage of having very small boobs, (although I always wanted larger ones!).  I left a message for my breast care nurse yesterday asking for the statistics of taking Arimidex or not but she is obviously reluctant to call me back.  I guess it's not a question that is usually asked as most people seem to want to hang on to life at any cost.  Please don't get me wrong, I have a very happy life with a wonderful (second) husband, two great sons and grandchildren and a large and loving family and woud like to be here as long as possible - but not at any cost.  It's got to be quality over quantity. I wish you well for the future. Lee x",

      "Content": "I originally went onto HRT 8 years ago because of insomnia - waking with hot flushes and not getting back to sleep.  Stopped HRT in December after diagnosis of breast cancer.  Had first op 6 weeks ago and then caught a virus, sore throat, cold, cough etc.,so have been taking paracetemol constantly since.  Had second op yesterday so still taking paracetemol and have slept total of about 7 hours in 3 days. So resorting to occassional diazapam which isn't helping much. I've tried all the usual, herbal teas, getting up and reading something boring, taking walks and nothing seems to make me feel sleepy, though I do often feel exhausted, but still can't sleep.  I guess it could be stress but frankly I feel that I'm dealing withthe diagnosis of cancer well and don't often lay awake worrying about the consequences.  I started Arimidex 3 weeks ago but the insomnia started before this so don't think I can blame these. Question - has anyone else had a problem with insomnia when taking Paracetamol? Or any other suggestions please?",
