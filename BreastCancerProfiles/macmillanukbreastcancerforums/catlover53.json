I\u2019m down for single mx and as one of four sentinel nodes affected I\u2019ve been put down for ANC or rads or POSNAC trial.  Ruled out trial as feels too out of control. I said I don\u2019t want ANC due to lymphodema risk as after SNBy arm is still completely numb and feels weird still and that was only four nodes and they intend taking 30.! im petrified of making wrong decision because if it returns or there is cancer still there after my chemo I will put myself through hell for not doing ANC. But the thought of lymphoedema doesn\u2019t sit right with me either. argggh what to do????????! My heads in a spin and I need to make decision as longer surgery time will be needed Tuesday if I\u2019m not too late already. My oncologist can\u2019t give me reassurance I need and surgeon has said I\u2019m doing right thing but I have to decide. I hate these decisions as I have really bad anxiety and cant cope with responsibility of playing Russian roulette. I almost wish they\u2019d decide for me or I had more than one affected so decision taken off hands. Surely they can do ultrasound to see if cancer still in there after chemo ?????",

      "Content": "Hi everybody, I found a breast lump yesterday evening like it had come from nowhere in my left breast. It\u2019s a hard mass with a pea sized lump on top of it.  My sister had breast cancer 3 years ago and they caught it on routine mammogram at nearly stage 4. She was lucky, the following week she had mastectomy. Hers was also left breast. I\u2019m so so scared guys. I went to the hospital earlier to walk in clinic but nothing he could do other than refer me to breast clinic urgently and told me to go drs Monday urgently because of my family history.  He gave me diazepam to help me sleep and relax. I\u2019m devastated and I don\u2019t know where to turn if I\u2019m honest  Please help me",

That sounds so vain but my sister lost all her hair and I\u2019m so upset that this has all started the new year off. This was going to be my best year ever then god went and stuffed that up big time for me with this. Had so many challenges in life I don\u2019t think I can fight this one now just have no energy at all.  How did you all get through the initial wait? Xx",

Can I ask you if yours appeared just overnight like mine has that\u2019 it\u2019s more likely to be an aggressive cancer than a fatty tissue or lump? I\u2019ve had fibroadenoma in past given all clear from that in 30\u2019s.  I\u2019ve had major issues with my stomach with alternating diarrhoea constipation and heartburn so my main focus has been possible bowel cancer and I have appt on 8th feb for that so to get this too had completely thrown me. I can\u2019t stop worrying or preparing for worst that\u2019s just me. It\u2019s actually now always aching xx",

      "Content": "Hi everyone sorry I\u2019ve not replied but as you can imagine it\u2019s been a frantic time.  So I went to my GP yesterday and he confirmed the lump as being a 2 by 1 cm triangular mass and I\u2019m being seen Friday at the breast clinic. I swear to god the look on their faces said it all. They were all looking at it there was two male drs and a chaperone and I wanted to cry when he said pass the tape measure. I\u2019m really struggling with the mental side of things.  I know a lot of healers through the internet and she kindly told me what to buy as I was food shopping last night. Said everything from scratch and had a reiki session last night.  I don\u2019t have a partner so my 24 year old son is coming with me Friday. Will I have all my tests done Friday at the clinic? The strange thing is I sleep terribly but could sleep for England right now and the dr asked me if I was fatigued or had been more than usual. I suffer with fibromyalgia so that\u2019s not unusual. I can\u2019t get the look on his face out my mind I wasn\u2019t imagining it it\u2019s that pitying look. Every morning when I wake up it hits me full on what I\u2019m facing that\u2019s probably why I\u2019m enjoying sleeping because I\u2019m not worrying then. I\u2019m trying to keep it together but I can hardly breathe at times. ",
