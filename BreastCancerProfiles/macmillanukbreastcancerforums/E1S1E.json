      "Content": "Hi I agree with the holistic approach, diet, meditation, councelling etc. Look up Penny Brohn on the internet. They are rolling out courses in many areas as well as in Bristol. I was very sceptacle at first but they won me over - it made sense but not sure why I hadnt seen the obvious before. Everyone has cancer cells that develop in the body but its the immune system that kills them off. Break down the immune system from stress, diet, depression etc. then your immunity stops working. They now have a lot of evidence, medical and scientific behind what used to be rejected as a new age/hippy approach. Also there are a number of books (some of which they support) designed to build your immune system up. Its not an alternative to medical treatment but an additional support. Take a look, you have nothing to loose.  ",

Appointments were right thru school hols and childminder was away. Costs for a student were £30 day to collect, trip to hospital 1 hour, waiting 1 hour, trip back 1 hour, but I only needed someone to mind him for 10 mins. Couldnt get anyone to help as they are not covered by insurance to sit in a waiting room for 10 mins with a child. Also I really could have done with some alternative therapy support, massage etc to help take the stress off. You can get some of these thru the various charities but they are limited. Lastly more information and courses on how diet and destressing helps.",

As yours in underneath then many bras have removeable chicken fillets so you can take one side out. Whats important is that you need to fit your bra to the larger side. I made the mistale of going for the inbetween size so one was too small and the other too big. I spoke to Macmillans recently about it and they said the bcn should have made an appointment to help get it sorted out but they havent so think that is your best place to start. A number of co's make bras for masectomies and a number with removable padding/fillets but I cant find any that have padding on the top section rather than underneath. Im going back to the bcn as see what they can come up with.",

I do know that other herbal remedies e.g. Black Cohort do work but are based on plant eastrogens and hence you cant take them with Tamoxifen as its working by reversing the effect of the Tamoxifen which is why it works. Some one else may have specifically asked about red clover so may have better info on that particular plant and if it also contains the same plant hormones. ",

      "Content": "Hi Dont know my number as you put it but also had bad se from Tamoxifen so had reduced the dose. Saw oc and they plug you into their stats machine i.e your potential survival rate for 5-10 years given the size. grade, hormone related results etc and then overlay Tamoxifen on top of that to see what statistically the difference is. In my case it showed Tamoxifen would only make a marginal difference so oc said to come off of it as the se were not worth it. So now been off for a couple of months and just doing alternative therapies now. The oc said if the difference was even 5% he would say to stay on it but  in my case it was less than 1% difference hence his suggestion to come off it. Prior to starting Tamoxifen, periods were normal and regular. It has forced me into the menopause however as the night sweats etc have not stopped although many of the other side effects have. You could ask the OC to see what the difference is so you can understand why he is suggesting to come off but I would suspect that you are only showing as a marginal difference so not worth it. Hope thats helped somewhat  Best wishes",

      "Content": "Hi I did contact the Macmillan Finance people and they were very helpful and gave me the names and contact numbers of companies and brokers that specialize in covering you for insurance following bc. I was interested in travel ins, life and critical illness and was expecting that they would not cover me for breast or related cancer but was wanting cover for loss of luggage, delays, other health conditions, accidents on holiday etc. I worked my way thru the list. I did find the brokers more helpful and informative. However I was advised by all that they wouldn't touch me insurance wise for anything until I had passed at least 5 years post treatment. Only after that could they find companies that would cover me although they expected the costs to be loaded but said they would start to reduce the longer you went on. I was really frustrated as I wanted to treat the kids to a few days at Disney Paris holiday after loss of their father last year to cancer and then my diagnosis and treatment which started 3 months later. I am still officially working so managed after a 6 month fight with my work insurance companies to get cover on their group policy. So for anyone still working its worth persevering if they have group cover. However would be interested if anyone has had any luck with getting cover outside of work as mine is as only as good as whilst Im still employed after which I would be back to looking elsewhere.",

Spent some time trying to convince myself it was my imagination but had to give in and call the BCN in the end. They got me back in for mamograms and scans and immediately said it was a cyst probably from the trauma of the op. So its worth getting it checked just to put your mind at rest. Also take the time to get to know how everthing feels now so that you know if something odd occurs and can get it checked asap. Hope this helps.",

I understand Tamoxifen can give water retention but also weight gain as it affects the livers ability to break down fats. so you could get either, none or both. Apple cider vinegar, celery, an some others are natural dieuretics so may help reduce fluid levels before resopring to stronger meds via your GP. ",

      "Content": "Hi They probably wont grade or stage anything until the lumpectomy and they can see whats going on. So you will only find out as you go along, get results etc. Try to take someone with you to remember whats said but if you cant, or dont want to, for the op make sure your clear on when you need to be there, where, when you need to not eat of drink from, what to take in with you and get it written down. Sounds stupid but you mind may go blank and you will need it to refer to. You will need someone to collect you and be with youovernight following the op. For the lumpectomy, find out if they will analyse the tissue during the removal (a few hospitals do but most dont have the facilities). If they are unable to do tests during the op then the tissue will need to be sent to the lab. Find out how long it will be before you get the results usually 7 - 10 days and will they send on the appointment. Also will they do any testing/removal of lymph nodes whilst they are there. This usually involves being injected with dye so they can trace the first to remove for testing and if so when will you get the results. Test results will also show if they have taken a wide enough margin (area around the precancerous cells). Its obviously best if they test during the op rather than the lab otherwise if the margins are not wide enough then you have to go back again for another go. They will usually give you a sheet for follow up care after the op, when you can wash the area, remove dressings, excercise and whats appropriate etc but if they dont then make sure you ask the bcn. Also what problems to look out for. Get a contact number for the bcn so you can call them if you have any problems. The next lot of questions come when you get the results. Hopefully this is of some help but sure others can provide more or better info. Best of luck and hope all goes well..  ",

I am also a massive dog lover but also someone who has lost their partnet to chemo. As you havent got a pet yet, I would put it back until post treatment and a period to allow your immune system to recover. Get a time plan from your onco and plan towards a pet buying party. Bringing in a new pet with the additional germs they bring, I dont think is a good idea when your immune system is compromised. Your not saying no to your kids and Yes sure its a delay but they will get over that especially if there is future plan. Im sure they would rather have both a parent and a pet, so why take additional chances and risks. As I said I dont want to be doom and gloom and it may not be what you want to hear but just giveing an alternative view for you to think about. Whatever you decide, I hope it goes well for you",

If no cancer is found in this lymph node then the assumption is that it hasnt spread via the lymoh nodes and then you would move on to rads etc as per your agreed path for your treatment. If however some cancer cells are found in the first lymph node which you will know when you get the results, then some further or all the lymph nodes in that area may need to be subsequently removed before rads/chemo. Also depending on the result it may alter your path of your treatment e.g. if no cancer is found in the first you may only have rads and no chemo etc. Also depending on results you may be offered other medication, pills etc as appropriate. Hang on in there as you need to await the results to see where you are going next.. Hopefully if its been found early, you will just move on to rads. Best of luck",
