      "Content": "Good to read your post crafty, it' s made me feel a little better. My mx and LD flap is next thursday, 31 March. I've been really positive up to today. But had a bad friday. Had sentinel node biopsy last thursday and they were due to ring me the results today. Waited all day for the call which came at 3.30pm to say not back from lab and it will now be Wednesday at earliest or even the day of surgery. Having spent all last night worrying about spread of cells I've now got to continue to wait for 5 more days. They've already moved the surgery from Monday to Thursday which I was Ok with but this today has got me down for the first time in the whole proceedings. Mines a Grade 2 lobular bc. MRI looked hopeful but you know how your mind starts to work overtime especially at the beginning of this journey.",
