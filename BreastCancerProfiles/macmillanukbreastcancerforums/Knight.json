      "Content": "Hi Dolina. Your're aloud to have down days . It would be odd if you didn't have times you just feel down. I am about to start my Chemo and this is a first for me . So sorry you have had operation after operation. That must be a drain. I went to see the chemo room last week and the atmosphere there was really warm and friendly. I felt less anxious once I'd seen where it all happened. You are right when you say how odd it seems to feel fine until you go to hospital. That's how I feel now. Fit as a flea and then Chemo may make me feel unwell. We'll see but I really value being able to hear your experiences and wish you all the best with your treatment. Often the fear and anticipation is worse than the reality. Xx",
