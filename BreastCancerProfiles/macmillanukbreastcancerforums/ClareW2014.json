      "Content": "Hi George and Jackie, Thank you for your reply, it's good to know there are people who understand! This feels like a very lonely time. We managed to contact the hospital today (!) and they have explained the situation a bit further. Apparently it is occasionally given anyway, in the wait for results of the HER2 test, as it does no harm but MAY do good. I guess it makes sense. Thanks again! Clare",

      "Content": "Hi all, I'm new here, so forgiveness for anything that someone else may have asked or mentioned! My Mum has just been diagnosed with grade 3 breast cancer. She's been given a 28 day course of anastrazole to start on, but the info on this says it works best in post-menopausal women, which she isn't. Â We are unsure of how well this will work for her, can anyone help?! Thanks in advance!",
