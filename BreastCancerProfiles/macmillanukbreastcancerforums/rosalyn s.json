I have a full head of hair very short and curly and its just not me I hate wearing my wig but I won't go to work without it as I hate my own hair, my hair used to be shoulder length and blonde, now its horrible I'm not a vain person but I just don't feel like me and nobody seems to understand that, even if my hair got to chin length I would be ok with that I just can't cope with that wig anymore it really hurts my head, so was considering getting extensions and just wondered if anyone else has had it done. Thanx Rosalyn xxx Keep well everyone x",

Although I think every brand has same side effects, o do get really bad achy joints unused Fontana it every morning, I then switches to night time but the night sweats were awful so I switched back to morning, I do go get the odd flush during the day but nothing compares to night sweat. I have not had any sickness on this tablet, so I would definitely take it in the morning but that just me all you can do is try what works best for you. Hope this helps Rosalyn xx",

Last week I wasn't very well got sent to hospital and was told I was neutropenic sepsis againi was totally gobsmacked after 7 days of iv antibiotics it wasn't coming up was .4 they stopped my tamoxifen and it rose to .9 and I did start to feel better. I hot home yesterday with oral antibiotics and was told to start taking tamoxifen again, well since I started to take it again I feel really unwell again, and I am beginning to think it is the tamoxifen that is causing it. I can't go on like this feeling so rubbish thought it was all behind me when chemo stopped I am really considering just stopping tamoxifen and just wondered if anyone had experienced this. Thanks for listening hope you are all well. Rosalyn xx",
