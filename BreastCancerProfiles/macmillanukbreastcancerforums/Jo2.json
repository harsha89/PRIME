      "Content": "Hi.Iam Jo 49 and completely new to this all.I started 1st round of EC chemo on 17th Jan.got diagnosed with self detected bc in left breast stage 1 grade 3 HERT positive on 2nd Jan (my sons 20th birthday).At Royal Masden Sutton they are brilliant.They said found it early. But need 6 rounds of chemo every 3 weeks,surgery and radiotheraogy and drugs for 12 months. On day 10 after chemo and feeling quite ok no real side effects.I am a runner and went to the gym so perhaps that has helped.Only been walking may try gentle gym tomorrow as dont want to overdo it or get any infections. I experienced a bit of night hot flushes when taking anti sickness tablets but when I stopped taking them they went. So basically so far so good. Also I did try cold cap first 10 mins was a bit uncomfortable but carried on and got used to it.Want to try and use it all the wsy through. Good luck ladies it is a very difficult time for all of us but we hsve to stay positive and active if we can as I believe it really helps.And we will get through this.",

      "Content": "Thanks Karen appreciate the hug and support.Yes perhaps better to stay away from the gym at the moment especially as low immune week. Will stick to a little walk today weather permitting. If 2nd round of chemo like this one it will be brill. Big hugs",
