I'm holding off telling her for as long as I can because her happy carefree face helps me get through if you know what I mean. So once lump out and I know more info I will decide then what to do. I've kept it to a select few people because normality is helping me keep strong. I love your attitude and positivity. We can't change it or make it go away...so we fight and crack on.
