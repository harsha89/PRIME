    "Content": "Hi Rusty I was diagnosed 2 days ago and going in for my op a week on Monday 30th, very up and down at the mo and have times when I suddenly think \"I have cancer\" and get soooo scared, lots of support from friends and ever text ends with me in tears, my husbands a rock. I joined this group the day I was diagnosed and realised I am not alone and there are some amazing woman on here with sound advice, hopefully we can all get through this roller coaster of emotions together, Take care xxxx",
