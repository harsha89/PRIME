    "Content": "Hi Sally, I started my fec chemo last week and did use the cold cap which I was fine with I used gingko bilboa for a couple of days before which helps pump the blood to the extremities and certainly helped me also my nurse put lots of gauze round the front of my head and by my ears which helps prevent brain freeze. I was told that your hair can be effected with each chemo so if you still have some it maybe worth trying the cap, even if you keep some and it grows back quicker its a plus, obviously you must do what is right for you. When you get your wig done perhaps check if your head if small medium or large as you weren't fitted for the cold cap before and the hair folicles will be very delicate so the hospital won't want to be messing with your hair too much, my cap was a medium. I have tried some wigs they were amazing am making my final decision on wednesday and will then have the wig cut to suit my face. Good luck with what ever you decide and remember it is your decision!!!Take care, Love Paulinef",
