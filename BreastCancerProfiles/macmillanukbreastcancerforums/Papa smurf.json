      "Content": "Hi, the day has finally arrived and I get results of test from USA today I hope. Then guessing decisions made re 6 months chemo then radiotherapy then hormone treatment or no chemo and just the other two.  The crazy thing is I have got myself in quite a state worrying about it. You hear such scary things about chemo . I have resisted the temptation to google but I know by sharing my fears someone will help calm me.  Up to now I have been so lucky. A routine mammogram picked up the lump no one could feel. The lumpectomy went well and the sentinel node was clear. Everyone has been so kind and I'm so grateful. Just feeling bit vulnerable this am after a long night.  Love and positive vibes to everyone on this amazing site. X",

Results not back from USA even though had surgery 11th February. Get the impression also decision could be passed back to me. What a decision. How can I make it? Didn't really follow a lot of what she said but think she thinks maybe chemo not appropriate for me. Is it worth putting body through it when maybe doesn't alter stats too much. 2%? And even with chemo could still come back. Radiotherapy and letrozole maybe my best bet to keep it away.  Am totally confused. ",

Any ideas as to how I can purchase some as I have a horrible feeling my GP will not prescribe it.  Thanks in anticipation of any help.  Big hugs. ",

I came home the same day and took paracetamol every 2 hours and also iboprofen every few hours. I don't know if I was lucky but it was not as bad as I'd feared. I found sleeping with my arm resting on a little cushion helped.  I started my exercises gently the next day and went a little walk in the sunshine. If you take it steady I'm sure you'd be ok to travel on a bus. Be great if someone could be with you though.  Good luck. Take care. X",

Am I irrational? I had been feeling so positive and now I'm just worrying all the time. And maybe overthinking things.  I need to start either chemo or radiotherapy and letrozole as soon as possible because I am doing nothing but worry at the moment.  Doesn't help that my care is also being transferred as I moved to a different authority a week before diagnosis.  Can cancer return in a matter of weeks?  Thanks . ",

Has anyone else had this experience? Would you use them even though not directed by your care team? The reviews I've read seem to rave about their use.
