      "Content": "Hi, I have mine flushed whenever I have bloods taken or have treatment which is usually once a week so I don't need to make any extra trips to the hospital. My dad had a hickman line and a district nurse came round once a week to flush his line. My line is wrapped in a gauze and then a tubi-grip or bandage holds it in place. It doesnt hurt or resrict me at all. I can even lay on it in bed. To shower and bath, I just hold my arm out of the way so it doesn't get wet. I have been given spare bandages etc so if it does get wet, I just change them. I just wear clothes that cover the tops of my arms so my line is covered. This is much easier now the weather is cooler! I might be going on a 70's night soon and thought I could wrap a sequinned scarf around it and make it part of my outfit! Jen xx",

      "Content": "Hi Joanne, I have a PICC line in my right arm and I have been fine with it so far. It's good because it can be used for chemo etc but also to take blood out so no more needles! My veins are small and hard to find so it was put in using local anaestetic and ultrasound. Hope this helps, Jennie xx",
