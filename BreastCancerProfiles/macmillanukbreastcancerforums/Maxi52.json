      "Content": "Hello This is my first time on this site. I am very frightened. Was diagnosed with breast cancer 29th April in my left breast grade 2 tumour size about 5cm with lymph nodes affected. Underwent breast wide local excision with total lymph node removal and breast reconstruction on both breasts on 3rd June. Went back for results and there was a lot of lymph nodes affected (21 out of 23) and the tumour measured 6cm - now I need a ct scan to see if cancer has spread but this is not until 10th July. Went to see oncologist on Wednesday 2nd July but he couldn't tell me anything because I haven't had the scan. He just said if it was found in other parts of my body I might not get chemo but tablets to control it came away feeling he had taken my hope away and felt very scared and worried. Now every bit of discomfort or twinge makes me think it has spread. I seem to be waiting a long time to get my next treatment started. Is anyone else in this position or can offer any advice I would be so grateful to hear x",

      "Content": "Hi Caroline I don't think your weird at all. Too be asked to be there at 7.30 in morning and not go to theatre until 7.40pm would have been very distressing. I know all the staff at the hospital do their best but it doesn't help you if they seem to be complaining about working over their time -that's not your fault. I'm not surprised you were in pain because you were so stressed and being stressed just makes everything worse. I also have rang the breast care nurses and left a message and although they have rang back you always know they are so busy and that just makes me feel that I can't bother them. I'm so glad your husband came back with choccies for you that is his way of showing you how much he loves you - a lot of men just can't communicate how they really feel because they feel they have to be strong. My husband is just very quiet but then he will go and book theatre tickets and I know that this is his way of showing how much he cares. You rant away you have everything to rant about. I think it is great you took part in a marathon and shows how caring you are. I hope everything goes well with the rest of your treatment. Take care xx",
