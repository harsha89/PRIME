      "Content": "Hi All, I've had some weight-gain since my experience, and have taken up running again as I'd enjoyed it some years back.  However I'm finding my reconstructed boob kinda uncomfortable in my sports bra... any helpful advice? I have a front-zipper type as I find it easier to get in/out of! However, I've got small boobs anyhow, so I don't need major 'scaffolding'!  Thanks in advance!",
