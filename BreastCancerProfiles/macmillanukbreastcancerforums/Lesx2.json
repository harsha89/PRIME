      "Content": "Hey your daughter will always think you are beautiful ! ;0) On a serious note thought I understand totally how you are feeling. When I discussed chemo with my 2 daughters, 10 and 12 at the time they both reacted totally differently. Youngest said she was shaving her head same as me and the elder distraught - obviously mums are embarrassing enough without the added wig! ;0) Its an age thing - awkward teenage stage methinks - i suppose just being open with her, asking her for suggestions will help. In the end I decided for my own reasons against the chemo route so it never came to it. But as you said yourself - its only a couple months and will be over before you know it ;0) Take care lesley xxx",

Denial methinks most def !! ;0) It was only after a few months and the reality of it all that it actually sunk in. And boy was that a day for emotions, anger, hate, loss all of them. All I can say is go with the flow and as Marsha says take each day as it comes. Everyone copes and deals with things differently and you will find your own way. Talk soon and take care Lesley x",
