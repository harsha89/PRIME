      "Content": "Hi Calm15, I was first diagnosed with BC in my left breast age 34 and then again in my right breast age 35, on both occasions, I had a lumpectomy, chemotherapy and radiotherapy.  When I was told I had BC, I just keep thinking, please don't mention the \"word\" mastectomy and even when I was diagnosed the second time, I still had the fear of that \"word\" and was relieved when they didn't mention it again.  It was only once I was confirmed BRCA1 in March 2014, that I knew I had to make that decision and go down the route of preventative surgery, it was a difficult decision, many months of should I, shouldn't I, but in January this year I underwent a bilateral mastectomy and DIEP reconstruction.   For me, my breasts became something that could potentially kill me, I now have two pert, lump free boobs which I am more than happy with. After so many months of worry, waking up after the surgery, was such a relief, I had done it! The fear of that \"word\" had gone and you know it wasn't as bad as I expected.  Having the immediate reconstruction didn't give me the loss of my breasts, I was put to sleep with boobs and I woke up with some!!!  I chose the DIEP option but I have a family member who chose implants and she is extremely happy with her results.   I think you are doing the right thing in deciding to remove both breasts, why give this dreaded disease another chance.  You will have doubts, it's only natural and the fear you feel is immense.  I am sure when you was first diagnosed you thought, \"I can't do this\", but you did! You just have to be brave and strong abit longer. This is just another hurdle to get over to be able to get on with the rest of your life! x Good luck and all the best for your surgery x  ",

      "Content": "Hi, I have quite a random question which I am hoping someone can help with! I had my DIEP reconstruction in January. Last night I pressed just below my scar line on my tummy and noticed a small lump, it is hard and when I pressed it, it has a springy feel to it! Today my left side has felt abit tender.  Has anybody else experienced this and can tell me what it might be? I am presuming it could be something they have used during the surgery? ",

Anyway, rather than worry, I have taken your advice and have contacted my BCN so just waiting for them to phone me back x ",

      "Content": "Hi Maggs I too have been diagnosed with BC twice, left breast 2010, then right breast 2011. On both occasions I had lumpectomy, chemo and radiotherapy.  We did always think it was strange that even the second time I was never offered a mastectomy but I was so fearful of the word and relieved that it wasn't mentioned that I never asked the reason why. In March last year I was confirmed BRCA1 and after months of should I, shouldn't I, I decided to go ahead with preventative surgery.  So in January, I underwent a double mastectomy, immediate DIEP reconstruction and Oophorectomy.  Deciding on preventative surgery is such a big decision and I am glad that I had that gap in between finishing treatment and making that decision, it wasn't forced on me, it was my choice and I have no regrets. It was recommended to me to just have the Oophorectomy as this would reduce the risk of breast cancer recurrence but I knew for peace of mind I also needed to remove my breasts, my consultant couldn't of been more supportive. Like you say have the lumpectomy, take time to recover and if you are adamant that you want the mastectomy, then I would talk it over with your consultant again. Good luck, and all the best with your operation x  ",
