    "Content": "Had three core biopsies 4 weeks ago, I have triple negative BC. I start chemotherapy on 20th June, panicking today because my boob aches and I have had swollen collarbone lymph\u2019s since the biopsy, a large g&t is helping at the moment, but to be honest I can\u2019t wait to start the process of getting rid of this illness. Any feedback reassurance would be welcome. Thanks xxx",
