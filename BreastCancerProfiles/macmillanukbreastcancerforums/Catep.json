      "Content": "Yes I\u2019d just got to the desired size on my last fill up the week before Christmas. Because I\u2019m in the middle of chemo the surgeon was going to replace it with a normal implant around March, after chemo and before radiotherapy.  The hospital managed to get hold of the surgeon and I have to see her 2nd January. I think it\u2019ll have to be replaced sooner now. ",

      "Content": "UPDATE: I will need another operation to remove the faulty expander after chemo with a different one where the valve is fitted between the ribs so I can have radiotherapy. The surgeon increased it by another 100mls but it was gone again in 48 hours.  You don\u2019t expect expander\u2019s to leak, especially when you\u2019re already going through so much. ",
