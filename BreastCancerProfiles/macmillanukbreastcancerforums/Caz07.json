    "Content": "Hi, not sure if anyone can help. Last week, following a mammogram (inconclusive), ultrasound, and needle biopsy I was told I had BC. Had a more detailed ultrasound, and another biopsies. The diagnosis was absolute, no doubt, surgery was booked for early August, further treatment to be decided, radiotherapy or chemo. Was told to tell family, friends & work as this would help, especially as was told the day before my mother in law's funeral. This week had a call to say that the 2nd biopsy was clear?? So now have a meeting with the surgeon next week to discuss what is next. I am really confused, not sure how I can have an absolute diagnosis, then a doubtful one. Can a lump be malignant & benign? The dr who did the 2nd biopsy used the ultrasound to giude her, and is certain she got the lump. Am really confused, I have told my family, work & friends, not sure how i feel, has anyone else had the same experience?    ",
