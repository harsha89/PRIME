Taken up yoga and Pilates to help keep myself as supple as possible.  Different brands definitely make a difference but I guess it's finding one that suits you . Mood swings and hot  flushes not too bad but I find I can't sleep if I take at night so take mine with breakfast . Not the best thing in the world but my GP says it's a wonder drug so I m persevering .....  Good luck with it all !! Gilikins ❤",

I find the mood swings worse than any other side effect though . Thought this might subside but seems to be getting worse .

When I got to my appointment yesterday they had already referred me for the biopsy and marked it as urgent . It's worth a try ...

Very non specific language used on the reports....\"suggestive of \"and \"indeterminate\" Seeing oncologist on 25th June . Has anyone else been through this ? I had a seatbelt injury 4years ago and bone scan identifies the light up area as where the sternum was damaged so holding onto that to keep me sane  All other areas of scan are clear except slight arthritis in my hip  Wise words would be welcome just now as going out of my mind with worry ",
