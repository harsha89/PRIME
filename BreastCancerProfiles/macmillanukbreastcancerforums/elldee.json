      "Content": "My daughter was diagnosed with fibroidal adenoma at the same time as I was with breast cancer. A number of tests were made before the final decision was given for treatment and these turned out to be correct. It is worth the wait in the end. Can understand your worries as was the same for my daughter but all turned out ok for her. Think Positive.",

      "Content": "Hi - I finished my chemo months ago. I have flaky fingernails and one toenail and the thumb nails tear downwards. I feel I eat heathily and use a clear nail strengthener but they have stayed the same. I sometimes get sore fingertips and big toe tip but they seemed to think that I should not have these symptoms after all this time.",
