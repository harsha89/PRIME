No I didn't have diep, I opted for an implant. I have a tissue expander in situ at present and then will have it replaced by a permanent implant. I am also having surgery to my \"good\" boob, to match it up a little bit. Again this is subject to waiting lists and bed availability. Hope all goes well for you. xxx",

      "Content": "Hi Pepys, Where I live the pre-op only last six weeks, but everywhere has different policies. However, as an ex nurse I know that operations involving more than one consultant are difficult to set-up. Plus Plastic surgeons are very much in demand and very thinly spread. The type of operation and length of theatre time has to be planned. Sorry,  added to this is the pressure on beds in the winter. Many many operations get cancelled at this time of year, and as yours will be classified as cosmetic, it will not be a priority case. The person who left the message is just being realistic, as they will be adding all these factors in. I know this isn't what you want to hear but this is the NHS in 2016 run by a Tory government. Contact PALS to see if they can help again. The hospital did make a mistake in the first place so you may be classed as a higher priority than most, but I would look to the Spring for your op. I expect to be having the second stage of my reconstruction then too. I have just been put on the list but because of winter pressures I am not expecting a date before March.  Good luck with it all, xxxxx",
