I did wonder if they might actually be bringing your op forward but you will know tomorrow and hoping and praying it will go ahead on or before your May date. So glad you're getting your hair cut - I had mine done last week. My hairdresser was so kind, he made it a lot shorter as chemo will happen in a few weeks so it won't be so drastic when I lose it!  He also said to take in the wig I got (not sure if I mentioned I got one for £25.00 from  https://www.wigbank.com  ) and he's going to cut it so it really suits me. Having your hair done will make you feel much better. Hope you will get a good night's sleep and all goes well tomorrow. love and hugs, Janet xx",

It always seems there is a wait for something else and the waiting can be worse than the appointment. I was told they do a bone scan and CT scan so they have a baseline to work with. They know what is normal for you and can track any changes.  Looking back through the posts it sounds  like you are doing really really well now, I think we are all stronger than we think we are though of course we have those 'moments' . I had one on Saturday when my daughter came up to visit with grandson. I felt very emotional when they left - not sure why!  Lots of love and hugs and keep going!  Janet",

The waiting for more test results is probably the worst time but once you know more it is much easier to cope. Life has changed dramatically and yes it's going to be very different. We will both come through this and out the other side stronger people. I have loads of people praying for me  which I feel is really helping - I don't know if this is your thing but more than happy to say one for you if it helps. Be prepared for treatment plans to change I was first going to have chemo then surgery but now it is the other way round and found out on Thursday it is mastectomy on Monday but glad treatment will start. Hang on in there. You are a beautiful person whatever happens and you will always be beautiful. J",

I think all these scans are normal - part of the ride. Try not to worry, none of them are painful or uncomfortable. They didn't tell me results of the scans on the day so unfortunately another wait, but they did come out clear:) I've been finding things to do like growing stuff in the greenhouse and a bit of watercolour painting. It takes my mind off it all - this is a time when we can do some those things we never normally have time for!
