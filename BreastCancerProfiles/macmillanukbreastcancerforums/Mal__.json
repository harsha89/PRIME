    "Content": "Hi Jonesy, I agree with Dorothee - some GP's will be better than others depending on where they spent their time as a junior doctor in hospital - but i doubt if many will have got very far as surgeons / oncologists. My GP for example said he had done quite a bit of Haematology so knows quite a lot about blood chemistry - but willingly admits he doesnt know very much beyond the basics on cancers. So sadly you will need to await until you see the specialist and they have done their tests. We appreciate what a difficult time it is being diagnosed - it is frightening, confusing. Most people say that once a diagnosis is made and treatment started ten things improve. best wishes Mal",
