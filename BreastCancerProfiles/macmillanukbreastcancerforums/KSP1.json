      "Content": "Hi I had an immediate recon last October (LD flap with implant) and the result is great. Stil waiting for nipple recon and may have a slight uplift on other side. I have a scar that runs halfway along my back but not visible under my bra strap. I am able to do everything that I could do before my surgery, lifting, using the rowing machine at the gym etc. Your consultant should be able to guide you as to what surgery would be best for you. Ask to see some pictures of the surgeons work. My breastcare nurse showed me pictures of my surgeons previous operations. It may be that you will have a different surgeon depending on what procedure you choose so ask who will be carrying out your op. Hope all goes well with your surgery Kirstie",

      "Content": "Hi Emma I had immediate LD reconstruction last October and can honestly say that there is no difference in the things I do now than the things I did before. I go regularly to the gym and am back to my pre-op routine including rowing, crosstraining and weights. My job also involves an element of heavy lifting at times and I have no trouble with this. Definitley don't feel lop sided, the only thing is sometimes a slight tightness on the recon side but moving and exercising soon eases that. Really pleased with the shape, seeing my surgeon next month about nipple recon and an uplift to even up the other side (just me being fussy though!). The scar along my back is easily covered by bra or bikini strap and the scar at the front is rapidly fading and hopefully once I have had the nipple tatooing will be even less noticable. Good luck in making your decision Kirstie  ",

So sorry you are having to go through this, the only advice I can give is take this one step at a time, your feelings at tne moment are completley normal and all of us here have been through this stage. Once your treatment starts hopefully you will feel a little more in control but be prepared for some days to be better than others this process is as others on here will tell you is a real rollercoaster ride of emotions! Look after yourself and call your BC nurse if you have any concerns about how you are feeling. There is a younger womens forum on here and also many hospital support units have younger women support groups, if you feel these may help ask your nurse if she has any details. Thinking of you Kirstie ",

      "Content": "Hi Wow Pat you are doing amazingly well to get back to work so quickly. I had the same surgery last October (but no lymph node removal) and I was told not to drive for 6 weeks. I would say that it took me at least a couple of months before I even started to feel that I could move properly. Admittedly I started my chemo 4 weeks after my surgery so this may have slowed down my progress. I still get odd twinges and weird sensations although I would say that it is not really painful anymore. My back gets a bit stiff sometimes and I find it a little uncomfortable at times to lay on the side of my surgery. Most of the time I am not aware of it now, I have no restrictions in my movement and would say I am pretty much back to pre-op strength. I think you will find that surgery recovery wise you will feel better and better each week that passes. Hope the rest of your treatment goes well. Look after yourself. Kirstie x",

I had 2 wigs one similar to my normal hair, shoulder length bob and one longer one but in the end I only wore them a couple of times, had my treatment through the winter so just wore hats, got lots to match my outfits! I finished my chemo in February and hair started to grow back within a couple of weeks but grew much quicker around the sides than on the top so looked a bit odd for a while. I still wear a hat to work but after a week off next week will probably brave it with no hat when I go back. Glad being able to work is helping, I think that just trying to keep a sense of normality where you can helps you to stop going mad. Thanks for your friend request, will message you later in week. Happy to share any of my experiences if it helps. Kirstie x",

      "Content": "Hi I was a regular gym user and runner before my surgery and chemo - FEC-T (Sept 2011 -Feb 2012) and was determined that I would be able to carry on going to the gym throughout my treatment. However I ended up putting my membership on hold shortly after my first FEC. I didn't have awful side effects with the FEC but just did not have the energy to go to the gym, the docetaxel made me more unwell and I barely got out of bed let alone exercised! I started going back to the gym in May and still find it quite tiring but it is helping me feel more normal again. I think whilst you are undergoing treatment I would stick to exercise you can do as and when you feel up to it, walks (in the Great British sunshine?!) are great and as others have said much less risk of picking up infections. Good luck with your treatment, take care Kirstie",

I was originally taking it first thing in the morning but was suffering with hot flushes (and strangely really hot hands and feet!) at night that meant I was awake at least 4 or 5 times a night trying to cool down so consequently very tired. I recently changed to taking my tablet in the evening and it has made a huge difference, I only wake up briefly once or twice, turn my pillow over and then straight back to sleep. i also have a chillow which is great and was also advised to tale sage tablets, (got mine from Holland and Barrett) Good luck Kirstie",

I can honestly say that it has only been the last 3 or 4 months that  I have finally got used to it, I do still miss my old boob but I am truly glad I was able to have immediate recon and it did take a good 12 months before everything had really settled down and I was able to feel properly comfortable with it. Give yourself time to grieve and recover - aside from the shock of a BC diagnosis you have been through a massive surgical procedure and that takes time to get over on it's own.

My chemo nurse told me that even a couple of days can make a big difference to your neutrophyll count so try not to worry your pre chemo bloods will probably be fine.  Fingers crossed for you Kirstie",
