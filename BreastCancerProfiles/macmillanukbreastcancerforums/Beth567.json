      "Content": "Hi, I\u2019m sorry to hear that you\u2019ve had a bad day looking for Bras and that you find yourself in the same situation.  I have found a few nice bras online and when I was out shopping with my sisters  we saw a few new mastectomy bras in M&S, not a huge range and I didn\u2019t notice at first as they were padded which I always avoid because of my cup size, but of course after the Op that\u2019s not going to be an issue. I have tried to think of the positives of the Op such as how much easier clothes shopping will be,particularly for dresses and of course that I won\u2019t have that constant worry of getting cancer.  I am however still panicking about how I\u2019ll feel when I wake up and am flat,it\u2019s hard to imagine when you have big boobs! I did look at the site recommended in the other post and the pictures did show much neater scars than I seen in other pictures. I was also told by someone whose been through this, that when you finally get the reconstruction it\u2019s a fantastic feeling and you really appreciate the new boobs, I\u2019m having deip reconstruction eventually and have seen photos of reconstruction my surgeon has done so I am not so worried about that part of the journey. Are you planning having this type of reconstruction? I hope it all goes well for you, I\u2019ll be thinking of you in June ( think mines now July) xx",

      "Content": "I have just returned from my hospital appointment with the plastic surgeon as I elected to have a risk reducing double mastectomy with diep reconstruction. I have a BRCA1 mutation and s very strong family history of TNBC and OC. I knew what to expect as my sisters had this following BC. However, I have a slight frame with big boobs and the only real option, for a good result, is a full mastectomy with reconstruction later using the skin and tissue from my stomach. We discussed other options but they all had issues. I have been given 6 weeks to consider all this but I currently feel devastated and find the thought of going from big boobs to nothing for a year hard to cope with. Has anyone else had this problem or can advise on feelings after mastectomy with delayed reconstruction? ",

      "Content": "Thank you both for your replies, lots of useful information, a good bra is obviously important, I have had a look and seen a few I like. I\u2019m glad that I would be able to wear a softie as I was worried I would have to wait some weeks before I could wear anything. I\u2019m sorry Freewheeling to hear that your reconstruction didn\u2019t go to plan, I think that\u2019s confirmed for me that this is probably my best option, I was warned that in my situation there is a good chance that an immediate reconstruction would have problems.  It\u2019s reassuring Ronstar to hear that the pain isn\u2019t too bad and I will take a look at that website you mention as I think it does help to know what to expect.  Thanks again for all the advice, I feel s bit better about it now, I can\u2019t really know how I will feel until after the op but I feel more prepared! xx",

      "Content": "Thanks Granny59 and Atty for bumping my post. Thanks Ronstar for your reply. You have given me something\u2019s to consider as I have been so wrapped up in the mastectomy I hadn\u2019t considered the after bit with prosthesis and bras. I have an appointment next month so will ask the nurse about them at that time. I did have a quick look online - not sure if I would feel confident to go to a shop for a fitting- and can see that a full cup is probably the best idea as you say.  Can I ask how sore you were after the surgery and when you can start using a prosthesis and bra?  My surgeon could do an immediate reconstruction but made it clear that I probably wouldn\u2019t be happy with the result ( I\u2019m an F/ G cup) and also because my breasts are wide I risk necrosis. I am slowly accepting that a delayed reconstruction would be best but dread seeing the results - I was pleased to see that you are quite fond of your scar now, that does make me feel better about it. I have been told that realistically if I want the surgeon I saw, I could be waiting well over a year before reconstruction.  Not an easy decision but I\u2019ve seen what my sisters have been through with BC  Thanks again for your help and advice xx",

      "Content": "Thank you all for your comments, think that was my worst day because I\u2019d only just had a proper look at the scars. i have spoken with the breast care nurse. and yes, as ronstar has said the fluid should re- absorb, the lumpy bits though are part of the scar which hopefully will flatten a bit given time as currently they are still a bit numb and uncomfortable- I feel like a henchman walking with my arms out as I can\u2019t lay them flat against my sides yet! Thanks Ronstar for your advice, I have been told that it does take a while to settle and will change over the next 6/7 weeks, so will see how I am then and as you say over the next few months. i will eventually have a reconstruction and my surgery was done in consultation with the plastic surgeon, with this in mind, although it won\u2019t be until next summer. This may as you say have affected how I see my self at the moment. On reading what you say about your bra; I have ordered a much softer, simple bra to see if that helps with wearing one, I had bought a pretty one to wear but maybe it\u2019s not the most practical at the moment. Thanks again for all your comments, it really did help at what was such a low moment for me. I wish you all well in your respective journeys  xxx ",

      "Content": "I am 10 days post a bilateral mastectomy - no reconstruction  My dressing are off but I hate what I see. I had looked at pictures before hand but didn\u2019t realise how distressed I would feel seeing the scars on my chest. These are quite lumpy and bumpy with one side worse than the other. I am also uncomfortable under my arms with a little fluid build up both under my arms and down the side where the drains were, I also have some lumpy bits there which make it uncomfortable to put my arms by my sides. I am also struggling to wear a bra with prosthesis as it\u2019s just so uncomfortable.  Does it get better? When can I use E45 to moisturise? Does massaging help and if so, how should I do this.? When do you start to feel more \u201cnormal\u201d  Just feeling quite down today x ",
