I know I could get someone to watch the kids if I told them what my app was for, hmm I'll have a think on about that as like you say if I can't really take husband in then he'll just sat around waiting & I think that might be worse For him, least if he's at home he can be busy with the kids, I could take my kindle.  How are you doing? I've just read your profile & you've really been through a lot, do you have a lot of support? X ",

      "Content": "Carolyn - I like how your kids have taken to the news, they are very matter of fact but very  resilient aren't they, it's quite a difficult age with hormones etc... But how well they've took it & carried on with life as best they  is testament to what a good job you've done bringing them up. I hope they're  very proud of having such a good mum.  I do thinks it's good that big names have made the subject easier to talk about & have made it more known but also that it shows kids it doesn't always end badly so not to jump to worse case scenario. The only thing it doesn't show is the emotional roller coaster & battle in between.  I found the lump while washing my armpit, i thought I felt the soap run over something but when I brushed my finger along the skin didn't feel anything, but when I push my fingers in , that's when I felt it, it feels like a solid hard ball hanging on something, like its in the middle off String (if you get want I mean) it's weird & scary too, I have no idea what to think, do I think it's nothing or do I prepare to hear something I don't want to. I'm glad really it's only in a few days time & I'll at least have an idea if it's benign or not X ",

      "Content": "Thank you so much Carolyn, it's really comforting to know I have someone to turn too, I think it's really hard not talking to anyone about it & it's great that I can here, my husband is being there for me but say it's going to be fine so I get the feeling he doesn't want to talk about the what ifs, so I'll leave it unless Monday our worlds are turned & then we'll have to talk about it.  I'm glad you took your boob out , it's a very courageous thing to do , I know how nerve racking it is showing something that you wouldn't have chose to do to yourself, & you do worry everyone will stare, I'm glad you was brave & I'm glad you realised no one did stare, I've got so many scares on my stomach due to the surgery I had last year I still hate wearing a bikini (as I'm constantly reminded every time I look in the mirror) but I braved it this year  on holiday, well I didn't want to go away but my husband booked it & said well I've paid for it now, my kids were so excited at a holiday abroad after everything that the past year or so had threw at us I couldn't let them down. I'm glad we went as we had a great time, only 4 days but it was enough to face my fears. Will you have your other breast done to match the new boob? It's great to know they can work such magic & give you a bust after going through this.  I have breast implants already, they're pretty new only  2 months old, (I've already spoke to the nurses etc.. Where I had it done & they've said they will have nothing to do with this lump & gp agreed) I had them done because I lost so much weight after last year (& having 3 children) my boobs were saggy empty sacks (like milk udders when I bent down) & they've given me so much confidence & made me actually like my body again & I think this is what's petrifying me more is the thought of loosing them, does that sound stupid?  I've felt happy for the first time in sooo long & im scared it's all going to go wrong. Did you have to have an MRI?   I've had MRI's & CT , PET scans before in the past so I know what to except in regards to them but I hadn't thought about maybe needing one for this, why do you think I'll need one? Won't the biopsy tell them everything they need to know?  I can't believe how  long you had been seeing your doctor before they took you seriously & I cant believe your first scan was clear, the cells must have been sooo small. It's scary. I bet your so glad you kept at them & kept going back, you just know when something's going on in your body don't you.  X ",

      "Content": "Carolyn28 hi Kate I don't think I'll have my other breast done, not yet anyway. I stopped pestering the GP in the end, I gave up and booked myself a private screening but I'm not sure what I'll do next year. Hopefully I'm in a minority, I don't think anyone else has had quite as much bad luck with screening and scans? if you have implants I don't think they'll do mammograms, it would be really uncomfortable for you. For my first annual mammogram they did the right side and then ultrasound on both. The different imaging techniques show slightly different information, it was my MRI that picked up the extra tumour on the inner upper area of my left breast, it hadn't shown on either the mammogram or the ultrasound, so I realise the benefits. In your case I'd say if they don't offer an MRI I'd request one. The lymph system is one of the body's main defense systems and it does sound like you are fighting something, whether it's breast cancer or not remains to be seen, but if it's not you will still need to find out what it is. Any number of infections can cause lymph nodes to swell up. coughs, colds, flu, mumps, glandular fever, allergies My daughter had a lymph node pop up in her groin just before we went on holiday, which was pretty annoying, but we had a GP look at it and , as they always do, he said come back if it gets any worse, but we were then away for two weeks, being over 16 I couldn't go in with her and didn't get a chance to say, but if it gets worse next week what do we need ??? It could have been any number of things but I don't think we ever discovered what it actually was. It could be the same with your arm pit node but with your other health concerns I'd be doing as many investigations as I had available to make sure I didn't miss anything. I wish my GP had been more vigilant for me and had taken my concerns seriously but at the end of the day, that mammogram said 'clear', you can't keep challenging every report. I do have trust issues now, but they seem to understand that. ... hang on a minute, if you only had the implants a couple of months ago this could easily be a delayed infection that could have triggered the lymph node to swell ... Nesslay   how long did it take for your infection to become a problem ????? Carolyn xxx Carolyn,  how scary that it didn't show on either scan but on an MRI.  I'm not surprised you have trust issues, I would if I'd been through what you have,just keep trusting your own instincts I say.   I too have trust issues but for the opposite reasons, being told you have a cancerous tumor  , scans etc... Highlighting it & being diagnosed, having organs removed , to only find out through histology that is wasn't, It was very very dark time indeed. Why in which I'm reluctant to do anything & believe anything that medical experts say to be honest. I went to my gp thinking this lump was linked to an issue with my implants & wasn't really that concerned. But my gp & the nurses at the place I had them done have assured me not, In the last few weeks or months  I've had no symptoms to suggest any kind of infection, no temp, no head aches, no burning or pain in either breast. My breasts wounds have healed extremely well . I've had Nothing to suggest anything. I've not had a cold or anything either.  The only issue I'm having is my mole removal (which I gather you've read my profile as you mentioned my other issues) this has bothered me & it has crossed my mind if the 2 are linked, but I really hope not, as the mole was top of my left thigh/groin & the lump is in my left armpit, if they are linked I really am in a whole world of trouble. It'll be 2 weeks on wed that I had the mole removed, so I'm hoping to get results in the next week or so. I have rang them & explained the situation with the lump & asked them to see if they can get my results ASAP.  I am hoping with all my might it's an infection of some kind, I just don't know how something can be going on inside & affecting my lymph nodes without it showing on the outside. I feel really good. By this time tomorrow at least I'll be getting some kind of answers. Thank you for all your advise. X ",

      "Content": "Well I didn't leave the hospital with anymore than I already guessed really, breast surgeon said its definitely a swollen lymph node, not due to infection tho, he said it can happen after breast surgery (I had uplift & implant 2 months ago) but it usually happens within the first week or so. So he doesn't understand why it would happen now (but with my history I'm always the exception to the rule) he wants me to have a ultrasound & biopsy  to find out why it's swollen but guess what, no radiologist in the hospital tonight as they're all at a radiology conference! So now I have to wait until Thursday! Left in limbo again! I was convinced one way or another I'd have an answer today & now I'm just left still wondering. It's rediculous considering it's meant to be a one stop clinic. ",

I'm glad you didn't have to wait long from your gp referral to being seen, having to wait a whole week for the results now  must be hell.  How are you coping? Are you keeping busy well?  I hope you have a supportive family & friends around you,  I haven't told anyone about my lump (apart from my husband) I don't want to cause them any unnecessary worry.    I've been checking my breast ridiculously now & don't feel any other  lumps (apart from the one under my armpit) but the area at the top that flows to my armpit feels swollen or thicker compared to my other if you get what I mean, I don't know if I'm finding things that aren't really there now or it could all be related,  I think a glass of wine might be needed once the kids are in bed X ",

      "Content": "Carolyn28 wishing you well for today I have to say that for a 'one stop breast clinic' they're pushing the boundaries, is this the third stop ? Demand quick results, they can do it if it's urgent and I think you qualify now, they have messed you around and you need answers quickly. I'm not sure if they can turn them around within the course of today but I would ask. My biopsy results were in within the week but had to go via a multi disciplinary team meeting which is only held once a week and both my hospitals did it on a Friday. The report also said that lymphoma couldn't be ruled out but nobody had ever mentioned that again. I asked when discussing my chemo plan with my oncologist but she said we needed to deal with the immediate problems first. The MDTM is where they all then decide the treatment plan, if one is needed.  I think you'll still be advised to have the nodes removed for closer examination under a microscope and to be on the safe side allow them to take a couple more but not full axial clearance. Read any consents carefully. hugs Carolyn xxx Thank you Carolyn. Your advice is very much appreciated.  Yes this is the 3rd stop. Ridiculous. This is private hospital too. Think nhs would have had it all done in a day.   I'm going to ask them to hurry my results up & I know there's a clinic on a Monday but like you say if it has to go through a MDT first it could be later.  In regards to your histology report I can't believe they haven't discussed that lymphoma can't be ruled out. I know that treating the breast cancer was a first & foremost but surely they have to find out if you do or do not have lymphoma as leaving it untreated is dangerous. You have enough to deal with without that hanging over you, I'd ask them to investigate further.  Thank you so much for your support. I'm off to the hospital now so I shall update once I know what's going on  X ",

It definitely makes you appreciate life doesn't it & makes you want to live life to the fullest & do all the things that make you happy.  Makes me realise I need to give my head a wobble & stop worrying about things unless I'm told there's something to worry about.

From what I've read every women's breast cancer is so different that each treatment can be so different with such ranges of prognosis too so at the beginning when your first told I can imagine every women must fear the worst.  you must have been on such an emotional roller coaster over the past year, how do you cope emotionally? Does it drain you physically too X ",

      "Content": "Essiejay - Thank you so much for your reply & I'm sorry to hear you've been diagnosed with breast cancer, how are you feeling? Do you know what stage & what your treatment plan is yet?  Thank you for telling me how things went on when you went to the clinic, it's definitely giving me a good idea of what to expect. I think it might be best if I go on my own if husband isn't allowed in anyway.  Waiting 2 weeks for your results must have been really difficult for you. I hope you have a good supportive network around you.   X ",

It's a difficult road & one that's made a little better when you know what your plan of action is. Thinking of you & hope you get more answers soon X ",

      "Content": "Well biopses done & dusted now. I cried like a baby (out of nerves I think)  but I actually think it did me good. A follow up app has been made for me to get my results from the surgeon on the 21st Nov. Radiologist said results wouldn't be ready until the end of next week anyway & surgeon does clinics every 2 weeks. So that's the earliest. It didn't hurt apart from the local. But that's wore off now & it's really sore. I just wanted to thank everyone for all the support & advise, you've been brilliant & will update once I get my results X ",
