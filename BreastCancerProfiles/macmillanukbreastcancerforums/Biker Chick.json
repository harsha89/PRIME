    "Content": "Bought my bras from Nicola Jane in Chichester.  The lady in the shop fitted me up and spent a great deal of time with me.  They also have branches in London and Leeds.  And a web site.  Also bought a nightie and a tankini at the same time, and a foam prosthesis.  Could highly recommend them.  I have also bought bras from  Marks and Spencers and Asda, but the fit and comfort if not a patch on the Nicola Jane bras. Best wishes Pauline x",
