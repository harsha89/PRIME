    "Content": "I had a lumpectomy last month and two nodes removed from armpit. Thankfully the surrounding tissue was clear and so were the nodes. Unfortunately though the tumour was a grade 3. I will be having radiotherapy and Tamoxifen but have been given the agonising decision of whether to have chemotherapy aswell. I really don't know what to do. The stats say that chemo will improve my 10 year survival rate by 5%. Is it really worth putting myself through it for 5%? Has anyone else had the same predicament?",
