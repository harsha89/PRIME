      "Content": "Hi there , I had a Hickman line inserted in my neck a couple of months ago . It means they can take bloods , give chemo or even antibiotics if needed without having to put a cannula in a vein , it's made my life so much easier whist having treatment no more making me cry with pain whist trying to cannulate . I did have to go to theatre to have it put in but it was just local anaesthetic and I was absolutely fine , it does make things easier . Hope your mum goes on ok xx",

I am prepared iv had my beautiful long blonde hair cropped off and got myself a wig which looks pretty close to my new style and iv brought a few scarves and hats as well it's just the thought that's stressing me out I think when it's gone it will be a relief and I think my wonderful husband is actually looking forward to shaving it off ,I think he's slightly sadistic lol xxx",
