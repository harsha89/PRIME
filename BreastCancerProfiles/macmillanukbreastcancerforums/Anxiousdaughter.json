Thanks again, Fiona xx",

      "Content": "Hi there My mum has recently had her last chemo for breast cancer, she also had a 4.5cm tumour with 3 involved lymph nodes, grade 3, so I know how you are feeling.  Chemo can be hard going and it seems a lot stretched out in front of you  with surgery and then radiotherapy, my mum is the same we are just awaiting a surgery date now. But you will get through it, it is doable and you will see light at the end of the tunnel, it is such a lot to take in especially when you have a little girl to think of also.  We have a way to go yet too,but I have found this site very supportive when I have needed advice and reassurance, everyone is very kind. Fingers crossed for you with your scans and good luck with your treatment, it will go in quickly once you get started. Very best wishes, love Fiona xx",
