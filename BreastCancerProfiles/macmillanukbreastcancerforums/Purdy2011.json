      "Content": "Thank you Margt, I feel I don't really know how bad it is? Am I going to die? Can they get me back to how I was? If I go to Glasgow I cold go private . I have been left two weeks already thinking about what might happen. I spoke to the BC nurse in the local NHS hospital and she said I wouldn't get a date for surgery this Thursday and it might be a few more weeks - is this wait normal? My private consultant said he was on holiday and so couldn't operate until 4 th June and that was too long but. Am thinking it will be that long at my local hospital ?",

      "Content": "Thank you for your positive comments. I fear that every time I see a dr I will be given worse news. I am pleased it is stage 1 and caught early but I am terrified that the longer I wait the bigger the risk of spreading as it is grade 3. Does anyone know if I am stressing for no reason? I am resigned to the surgery and treatments and just want to get on with it all and get on the road to recovery if that's possible. I will deal with the side effects as best i can as long as they can do something to make me better. I am trying to stay away from google and am limiting myself to this site!",

Even at my local hospital I will have to travel for 40 minutes to raigmore in Inverness. Yours seems to have happened quite quickly. How was your chemo? How are you feeling about the grade 3 diagnosis - that's what is panicking me the most as I know that is aggressive.",

      "Content": "I have just been diagnosed with stage 1 grade 3 BC following a biopsy. I am waiting to see the consultant after he has had the MDT meeting this Wednesday. I have two 7 mm tumours. I am 36. Firstly does anyone have any encouraging words? All I can find is doom and gloom. I have chosen not to tell many people because I can't cope with the sad looks on people's faces. My mum had BC at 43 had lumpectomy, chemo and radiotherapy . My dilemma is this, I was told at gp referral I would have to wait 5-6 weeks to see a consultant so as I have medical insurance I travelled to a private appointment ( 3 hours away as I live in the highlands) anyway I was seen and biopsies quickly and went for my results last week. The consultant said. Sold have treatment in my local nhs hospital as the travel would be impossible. I agreed but have been told once I get lumpectomy date which cold be another couple of weeks there is a waiting list of at least 6 weeks for radiotherapy. I could transfer again to a different consultant in Glasgow and stay with a friend over the summer holidays ( 2 x daughters 7 and 9) to hopefully have op and radiotherapy and then travel for chemo. If any of you have been through this do you think I should go to a private hospital or stick local? Tank you in advance x",

      "Content": "Hi just thought I would update and get your thoughts! I went o the consultant today and he agrees with the consultant I saw privately that it is stage 1 although until the op he won't know for sure it's not in lymph but the scan looks good etc. I have another lump which was picked up at previous biopsy but was considered to be benign by radiologist and consultant however after MRI the new consultant wold like to know for sure so it has been biopsied today. If its malignant I am facing a mastectomy as it old be multi focus but if its what they all think its a lumpectomy on the 18 th June ( such a long wait:() then chemo and three weeks radio. I can handle the whole thing if it remains lumpectomy chemo and rads as I see the chemo as the bad bit and its only 1/3 of the whole treatment , if its mastectomy then I will find it more difficult as that's 2/3 of the worst case scenario. Anyway I feel a bit better knowing two experts have agreed and that I have a plan in place that will I hope be complete by Christmas. ( please tell me this is reasonable?) I can't praise the breast care nurse highly enough - such a fantastic resource. Results from biopsy are due next Wednesday so please keep your fingers crossed for me!",

Tonight I took the bull by the horns and I went to my normal exercise class, I haven't been for two weeks since this all started. I cannot tell you how much better I feel mentally. If I can do an hour of boot camp then I am in good enough shape to fight this head on! The last week has been very long for me too but only one more day to get through! Wishing you the very very best of luck tomorrow xxxxxxx",

I was diagnosed last Tuesday with ductal cancer 2 x 7mm tumours. Considered grade 3 but that could change. The dr I saw didn't think it had spread to lymph following scan but that will be tested and confirmed after surgery. I can't believe I am here either. My head is all over the place and I am dealing with it by denial. On the days I don't see a dr etc I plan to lead as nor al a life as possible. I have two girls age 7 and 9 who I haven't told yet. Am waiting for a surgery date etc before I talk to them. Good luck on Wednesday xx",

      "Content": "Hi. I feel a bit better after my appointment. My surgery date is also the 18th. I had another biopsy on a lump both the consultant I saw privately and the consultant I saw yesterday both feel is nothing. But he wants to be 100% sure before we start surgery. If its benign we are planning a WLI of its a tumour it's a mastectomy as it will be multi focul. We decided to go for WLI as he feels he can get it out with a good cosmetic result and if he can't we can always go bigger next time! I will have chemo and then three weeks radio. If its a mastectomy I will find it harder to deal with as I feel that's two really awful things to get through - mastectomy and chemo if its a lumpectomy the worst I feel I have to face is losing my hair. I looked at the scan pictures and the MRI and interestingly that put my mind at rest _ from te MRI ican clearly see there is nothing in the other breast and nothing else in the bad breast. I may feel different is its oestrogen positive. An unhelpful friend said to me tonight if it is she would recommend a mast . My head was sorted before I spoke to her. I spoke to a breast specialist from Macmillan who I know and she feels the most informed decisions have been made and I have has the benefit of two experts looking at my situation and they have both agreed the same course of action. I see this as a blip that I need to get through but hopefully by early 2014 it will all be over. Then I get regular checks. I may opt for a scan of liver lungs etc after it all just to be sure - has anyone done this? Isabella it looks as though we are doing this together with the same surgery dates!",
