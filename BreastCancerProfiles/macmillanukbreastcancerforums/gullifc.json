      "Content": "Hi there, thanks for your reply, really sorry to hear about the loss of your husband...as if there isn't enough to deal with already? I'm in Southampton but very happy to chat, I'm quite new to this site, but think its fab that there is so much good positive stuff on here. Even tho' your children are physically located an hour away, you know they're on the end of the phone if you need a chat. I spend lots of time on a messenger app to my eldest....just nice to know they're there for you :)  I find out later today when my chemo will be starting..have to say I am dreading it, but then I know its necessary to knock the cancer on the head. All the best for tomorrow Stay in touch and take care :) xx",

      "Content": "Hi Anna, thanx for your reply......so glad I discovered this website. Don't know about you, but when I was first diagnosed I felt so alone and as if I was the only person in the world going through this!! It's so nice to see all the positive comments on here. Good tips too, I will definitely try to make up some meals for those days when I'm not feeling so good. Will find out later today, exactly what cocktail of treatment I will have for chemo, but I am also having Herceptin, same as you. How many sessions have you had so far? Take care and thanks for the advice :) Clare x",

      "Content": "Hi there, I had surgery a week ago, when I had a lumpectomy and lymph node removal. Despite the good news following surgery that my lymph node was free of cancer cells as was the margin of tissue around the tumour, I was also told that I had grade 3 cancer, which freaked me out !! Because of that I will be having Chemo, radiotherapy, Herceptin treatment (as HER2 positive) and Tamoxifen (as Oestrogen receptor positive)...so in all treatment will take approximately a year. A really daunting thought as my husband walked out on me before I found out about all this so the person I could really do with being around isn't...and altho I have a fab sister and sons, I am finding the loneliness plus everything else very hard to deal with. Has anyone out there with a similar diagnosis been through this treatment too who can give me an idea of what to expect? Thanx x",

      "Content": "Hi Anna, thanks for your reply. My sons are 21 and 17...the 21 year old is away at Uni, but tries to get home to see me when he can...the youngest is doing his best but don't feel that I want to put upon him too much...plus I'm worried I'm going to tip my sister over the edge if I lean on her too much, altho she has been fantastic and I don't think I could have got this far without her. Think my chemo is due to start in the next couple of weeks, so perhaps we can compare side effects !!! How many sessions will you need? What's this about pineapple and ginger beer?!!!! All the best :) Clare ",
