      "Content": "Hi I have also had immediate reconstruction by DIEP. A diep does NOT use tummy muscles just tummy fat. But, it is a good question to ask and let the surgeon explain so you the info from the expert. A diep is a long surgery and a longish recovery. I was bent double for quite a while and for the first week had quite a lot of back pain from shuffling around. So try to avoid that too much. There is also no denying the very long scar hip to hip but mine has faded and is hidden under underwear (and I don\u2019t use Granny knickers) and bikini bottoms. The flat tummy is an add on advantage!! The new boob is very natural looking.  When I went for my consultation re surgery, I found a long list of useful questions on line to ask re diep plus I added some of my own. I then just handed the list to the surgeon and he went through them one by one and wrote down things for me.  A deip is considered the Gold Standard of reconstruction and if you can have immediate reconstruction it is the best way to go. However, although some ladies have fast recoveries sometimes recovery is much slower than other methods due to the huge abdominal surgery. But, it is doable and certainly worth it. hope this helps. Good luckxxxxxx",

I had immediate reconstruction by DEIP as had a bit of tummy fat to use.  I did not want to go flat or have to use a prosthesis.  The only direct question I can answer is in the future I think you only have a mammogram your remaining original boob as you don\u2019t have any breast tissue to mammogram on the reconstructed side. The good side will be done yearly. I had my op just before Xmas and have already been sent a mammogram appointment for mid December 2018.  Good luck in choosing the right option for you. There is so much to take in and in a short amount of time. I hope somebody on here can give you some info on the other questions.",

      "Content": "Hi I can't speak for what other teams do but the cosmetic surgeons I had seem to do it this way. A deip is around a 5-7 hours (sometimes much longer) operation it's complicated and clever micro surgery much bigger operation than having an implant. Also, I was told they have to let the new tissue settle to see the final outcome before they adjust the other to match. So, if your team does it this way then yes you will have to wait for a reduction. This was one of the questions I asked at my pre surgery consultations before I made up my mind to go ahead. You should talk to the surgeon before hand as to how they usually deal with this. They will also talk to you about your previous surgery as depending on exactly what you have had done it may mean you won't be able to have a diep. Not everyone is able and then they will advise the best option for you. Before you make any decisions the surgeons will advise you of your options and explain everything to you. A deip is complex specialist surgery and not done at every hospital - that say a lot!!!!! Hope this helps.XXXXXXxx",

What they seem to do is do the mastectomy and reconstruction in one op then they reassess the look of the reconstruction after everything has settled, usually 3-4 months later and then tweak. That means either fiddling around by lipo modelling to new boob to make the shape better, which is what I had done plus nipple reconstruction or/and offer reduction on the other side if needed. When I was having my tweaking done there was a lovely lady who was having surgery before me who was having breast reduction to match the other side after a diep. I think they like to wait to see the outcome of the first big op before they start to cosmetically balance. Mastectomy and immediate diep surgery is a big enough operation in itself to go through without adding to it. Also, and it happens very very rarely (I was told around 2% chance) that the new boob tissue could fail. But, you will be offered it but it is done in stages. XXXXXxxxxxxx",

I was diagnosed with 4.5 cm of high grade DCIS last year and has a mastectomy and immediate reconstruction by DIEP just before Xmas. I went through all sorts of emotions prior to surgery, trying to work out the best option and then I was terrified about the surgery. It is all such a lot to take in at once. My op went very smoothly. I was hospital 4 days but at home recovery was slow. So long as you have your pain relief to hand it\u2019s fine but I couldn\u2019t stand up straight for weeks and I was so tired. Others have had differing experiences with how quickly they straighten up. The abdominal surgery is the worst bit. However, now I\u2019m pleased I went for a diep as it looks so natural. I know there are many lovely ladies here who are quite happy with just having a mastectomy and going flat but I really couldn\u2019t. I went on holiday this year and I was back in my bikini and feeling completely normal (and with now a very flat tummy). If you can and you want to have reconstruction do have the diep as it gives a great result. It is a big op and don\u2019t expect to be running around normally for quite  awhile afterwards but life will go back to normal. i am awaiting nipple reconstruction and a bit of tweaking to the side.  Any questions please ask.

As far as my cosmetic team is concerned your nipple is reconstructed separately. When you have the diep the piece of skin taken from your tummy replaces your nipple and this is where they listen to make sure all is ok with the new boob. it does sound very daunting at this stage but take it one step at a time.

However, the results are amazing you end up with a new natural looking boob with a natural droop that is warm and soft to touch. I have had some lipo modelling and nipple recon and presently having nipple tattooing. If you can face the surgery - well it's more the recovery than the surgery, it's well worth it and I'm very pleased with the result.

You should wear it all the time for at least 6 weeks. Also good pair of support knickers are good to help with abdominal swelling and scar. I was advised (and bought) M&S sports bra with front zip - black one with pink edging and the front opening post surgery bra from House of Fraser website it has hooks and eyes. Both are comfortable. The hospital preferred the one with a zip for access-  at first on hourly basis. There are plenty others out there but was fairly lazy and bought what the hospital recommended. I bought strong support knickers from M&S.  Size wise your tummy will be smaller- surprise surprise - have gone down at least a size. I had to go and re buy smaller sizes.  Sports Bra- buy size larger than normal but you don\u2019t need it huge as you need good support. I had 4 drains all went in without interfering with  clothing. I was only in hospital for a few days and used sports bra, hospital gown and \u2018dressing gown\u2019. Didn\u2019t wear support knickers until I got home - could not do so in hospital as had 2 drains in abdomen. Hope that gives you some ideas....Xxxx",

They took every bit of fat from my stomach and then with the swelling I could hardly eat anything before I was full. I lost weight all over Xmas......only time ever.

After a while I was then able to ditch the V pillow and used loads of pillows, then ditched the extra pillows and slept with just the pillows under my knees. I did the latter for quite a while. The first few weeks I thought things were never going to get better and I stooped for weeks. I also had to sit with my legs up on something higher. I was also very tired for months. But, please hang in there it does get better you do straighten up eventually but it does take a while.  Don't push yourself you have had a huge operation and not wishing to be too graphic a chunk of your tummy has been taken away and the two sides sewn back together again. At the moment at the stage you are 1 week post op the only advice is take the painkillers, rest and be patient. It is very very early days for you. When you can walk a little go for walks as this will help with blood flow and the healing process for you abdominal wound. I did find walking helped a lot.  I hope this has helped a little. I am now 10 months down the line and back to normal with a very flat tummy and dropped at least a dress size. All my old clothes are huge on me now!!!!!! Xxxxxxx",

I was also able to have an immediate deip which I was told was the best type to have especially as I was only having one side done. It certainly is very natural in feel and look - you can't tell in a bra. But, in my deip they moved the tissue to create the bulk and I will be having some shaping to the side and my nipple reconstructed later in the year. My tummy is amazingly flat!!!! Yes, it is worth the hassle and the results are very good. Good luck with your's but you really need to take it very easy post op. ",

Definitely no \u2018living it up\u2019 on the dance floor.  Recovery from deip is slow. I had an immediate diep and my surgery was 6-7 hours long. The anaesthetic, and the general stress and trauma of biopsies and results and shock etc in the immediate weeks prior to surgery, affected me for ages afterwards and I was very tired post op. You might be very different as yours is delayed reconstruction. The abdominal part of the surgery however can be a bit of a problem. I was unable to stand up anywhere near stright for over two weeks as everything was so tight. Post op is perfectly OK so long as you take it easy and don\u2019t push yourself unnecessarily. I think the wedding may be a case of see how you are a few days beforehand as you do improve a great deal each week. Good luck. Xxxxxx",

However, there is no denying that recovering from the abdominal bit of the surgery is the worst part. Some ladies suffer more than others from this. I did suffer. Somebody on this site mentioned that those who had less fat suffered more. Not sure how true this is but all I know is i have absolutely no fat on my tummy now. Also it does all stretch out again. Again rest, take the pain killers, watch rubbish on TV and hang in there. Also when the time comes make sure you do all your exercises. The ones for the abdomen will help but you are not  able to do them yet. In a few weeks time. Can\u2019t remember the exact time scale now. Xxxxxx",

The hospital advised me to take in a front opening bra and gave me some suggestions: sports bra from M&S the black one with pink edging (comes in other colours) in a size larger than you would normally wear i.e. Not too tight - The fitters ther did help me on this. Or, the front opening post surgery bra from House of Fraser website it has hooks and eyes......Or something similar. I was lazy and bought what they suggested and they were fine. The bra was put on me during surgery and it needs to be front opening for access for the obs they will be doing hourly afterwards. I was also advised to buy some sort of support knickers not necessarily needed for when you are in hospital but to wear directly afterwards for support for your abdominal surgery. They help tremendously. I was in hospital for 4 days and had 3 or 4 drains so used the hospital gown, a 'dressing gown' and a pair of crocs for pushing on and shuffling a few steps in. The hospital gave me a nice pair of thick socks to wear but if they don't they could be useful if it's still cold.  Good luck with operation. It is a long surgery but the results are really good. Take all the pain killers and be kind to yourself afterwards it's a slow recovery but it's doable and you will improve. I hope all goes well.",

After much thought and angst I decided to have immediate reconstruction by Diep. My op was just before Xmas so I\u2019m 6/7 months post op. It was a huge surgery but all went without a hitch and I\u2019m having some slight adjustment to the side and  nipple reconstruction when my name hits the top of the list, probably in the Autumn some time. My hospital said they automatically took the nipple away. In underwear or bikini I look just as I did before (if anything slimmer) and nobody can tell I\u2019ve had surgery. The feeling of the new boob is quite natural with a natural droop but at the same it does feel slightly different to the other side. I can\u2019t quite put my finger as to how to try to explain it to you. The worst bit is the abdominal surgery but mine is now healed and I have a very flat tummy. My new boob is a very good match to my other one so I\u2019m not having done to the other side. Seeing I was in the position I was in, I certainly don\u2019t regret having a deip. At the time however I was terrified and as you say not much info out there. I must admit there are now quite a few ladies on this site who have had teconstrtuve surgery. Diep is the best to have if you are able and can face it.  I hope this helps, just ask if anything else. It\u2019s a big decision.Xxxxx",

Having said that this is much more important when you just have one side done. Also, mastectomy and implant as you say is a much smaller op as you say and recovery is much quicker. However, I was told at my consultation that implants can cause issues years down the line and if you are able they always recommend own tissue as although a bigger op there\u2019s less after care. But you do need the tissue on your stomach this is particularly important for you for both sides to be done by diep. My surgeon came firmly down on side of diep if you can have it.

      "Content": "I'm really sorry about you having to face this journey. I am at home at the moment recovering from the latest surgery regarding my breast reconstruction. I had a mastectomy and immediate reconstruction by DIEP last December which was a huge operation and I went round and round in circles as to whether it was going to be worth the discomfort etc Last week I had lipo modelling and nipple reconstruction and so I'm again feeling quite battered and bruised. However, I do realise you are thinking of an implant which is a much smaller operation and a much quicker recovery but it is still surgery. Having been through what I have had done I don't regret it one bit and extremely pleased with the results. Also, having a reconstructed boob makes you feel whole again, which really helps you own well being. I wanted to get on with my life and I felt that having one flat side would be a constant reminder of what had happened. That mastectomy scar is quite brutal and I wasn't sure I could deal with it very well. Also on a more practical level having reconstruction makes it not a problem to wear skimpy clothes or swimwear as you are not lopsided. I realise that this may be a bit of vanity but it did feed into my decision. On the other hand there are plenty of ladies who are more than happy to go flat and it doesn't impede on their life style at all. It's a very personal decision and you need to weigh up the pros and cons according to your own personal circumstances and what is right for you. I found hammering it out with somebody who knew me well was a good idea. My husband immediately told me i should have reconstruction as I would find it difficult to cope with the reminder of what had happened if I didn't. He knows me well and was absolutely right. I am glad I went through with it despite being petrified beforehand. For me the pros for reconstruction far outweighed the cons. I hope this has helped a little. Good luck with whatever you decide, it is a very personal choice and one that in the end you can make. XXXXXXXXxxxxxxxxx",

But, each person seems to be different as far as this is concerned. I also seemed to be very tired after the op no doubt part of that was the effects of the anaesthetic but also due to all the tension that had built up prior to the op as things moved extremely quickly from a routine mammogram  to major surgery in a matter of a few weeks. My new boob has feeling and is warm just like you would expect but it does feel slightly different as the tissue is different.  I can now do everything as I did before. However, I am careful picking up heavy items if I have to twist my abdomin, it's not that I have been told this but I am a bit more careful. I asked the surgeon re reconstruction in the future if there were problems with the other side. He said they would use tissue from another part to reconstruct but the tummy tissue was the best to use as it was the most similar to breast tissue.   To be truthful I don't think about my new boob very much. (Indeed, my new boob is so much a part of me now that have been poking and prodding my boobs while writing this to answer your questions, much to some strange looks from my family!!!!) It's only when I'm in the shower etc that I remember about it as it's a bit fat on the side and there is no nipple - I am having both sorted. It also feels different whether that's because of the tissue or the tweaking that's needed I'm not sure and will only be able to answer once it's done.  But, now that I'm back in all my old underwire bras everything feels and looks the same.  Good luck in deciding what's best for you. It's not an easy or straightforward decision. Any more questions please ask as I'm happy to let you know my experience.XXXXXxxxxxxx",

      "Content": "I had mastectomy and immediate reconstruction by diep just before Xmas. It\u2019s a huge op and I was very apprensive. Spent 4 days in hospital then long slow recovery at home. I couldn\u2019t walk properly for weeks and was really tired for ages after, all very normal after such surgery. Abdominal surgery is the worst bit. Results now amazing as you have a natural looking boob with a natural fall which will age with you. If you can have a diep and face the op and recovery, I think it\u2019s the best reconstruction available at the moment. Seeing as I had to have a mastectomy I\u2019m pleased I went down this route - although  it\u2019s a big and scary thing to decide. I was petrified before hand and all over the place as to whether I was doing the right thing. All the surgeons - cancer surgeon and cosmetic surgeons all said If it were them they would do it.  As ruby rose has said you must do your exercises and massage scars. I have been using Bio oil.  Good luck and please ask if anything. Xxxxxxx",
