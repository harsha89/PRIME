      "Content": "I was lucky enough not to have my breast removed but had 2 surgeries, I am left with a scar at the side of my breast but feel an overwhelming sense of shame or embarrassment. I  have been swimming once since and wore a t-shirt. Now I just tell my children I am unable to go swimming with them as I do not feel well. I am very mindful of the clothes I wear since. Has anyone else had this feeling/experience??",

      "Content": "I had my 7th session of radio today, after my first two, I began to get a sore tender nipple and my breast was quite painful, when I said to the radiographer about it at my 3rd session, he told me although it is normal, that is usually after around two weeks 'most women' can feel discomfort and pain........ although not in all women. The second radiographer I saw at a different hospital at my 4th session, told me there should be no pain or effects like that, she put it down to wearing my bra too tight and sleeping oddly (I wasn't impressed with her dismissive attitude) After todays session (my 7th), I am having shooting pains going across my centre of my chest which is causing some breathlessness. Has anyone else experienced any side effects like this earlier than 'most women'? Thanks",

      "Content": "Since being diagnosed with High Grade DCIS, I have sought solace on reading women's plights with all forms of cancer. However, I feel really fraudulent being on here, when I speak to my consultant and oncologist, they talk about me having 'pre cancerous cells' so if it is 'pre cancerous, why bother treating me at all.  I wonder why I have had to have 2 WLE and have to have radiotherapy, if it is being downplayed by them . Reading most women's feelings around dealing with all stages of cancer has been really comforting and helpful for me as I haven't been able to explain exactly how I feel to my family and while they are supportive, they don't entirely get it, whereas being on here the same emotions as I have are being recognised. But I feel by having DCIS, its not the same as having invasive and so I shouldn't be on here being a martyr. Although I don't feel like that is what I am doing......... does that make sense? Does anyone else understand what I mean or have the same feelings??? Thanks, from a very confused and conflicted Kay xx THANK YOU FOR ALL OF THE COMMENTS, I FEEL MUCH MORE REASSURED, I ALSO FEEL VERY LUCKY I DID NOT HAVE TO HAVE A MASTECTOMY, I REALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY SOME WOMEN WITH HIGH GRADE DCIS HAVE TO HAVE THIS AND SOME DO NOT, HOWEVER I THINK YOU ARE ALL INCREDIBLY STRONG AND SO SUPPORTIVE. GOOD LUCK TO US ALL.",
