      "Content": "Mazza10 Hi , I was looking through posts as my scalp is so sore at the moment. I had my first chemo on 9th June and have been fine , waiting for all the side effects and haven't had any so far... no nausea etc ..then yesterday the 22nd almost 2 weeks later washed my hair and noticed loads of loose hairs in the towel,on the brush and if I breathe they are falling out everywhere! But today my scalp from the crown to my forehead is so sore it feels like sunburn.. is this 'normal'? It really is so sore. Hi, yes it is normal. When the soreness wears off I suggest shaving off n head will be better. Aloe Vera also helped mine. X",

      "Content": "Canne77 Hi guys I'm inbetween 1/2 chemo sessions due to have my 2nd next Friday. My hair is very loose right now and losing if I simply touch my head although it feels like it falls out if I just LOOK at it!  I was embracing this part of the treatment up until NOW - now its happening and its hit me and it don't make it feel better that I have got pain on my scalp too and the headaches are literally waking me up It's so emotional I did cut all my hair into a pixie cut to make the pain ease off and the pain is getting worse. I'm not ready to shave it just yet.  In anybody else experience with this how long does the pain last for is it the entire time that the hair falls out? I had a few cuts before hubby shaved all off after head stopped being sore. Once shaved there is no pain at all. When I was told this I found it hard to believe but it really works. I put aloe Vera on to sooth head. X",
