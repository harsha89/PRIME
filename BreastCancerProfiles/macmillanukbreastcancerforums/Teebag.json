    "Content": "Hi Ivelindev I too was scared and anxious going to my second lot. Not sure its the apprehension of knowing what may be coming. My symptoms after my second lot were slightly different. Day 5 and 6 in my case were worse than the previous round but I definitely came out the other side quicker (although I still had nasty side effects). I am just ahead of you - 3rd lot next Friday - starting to get apprehensive again. Good Luck XXXXX",
