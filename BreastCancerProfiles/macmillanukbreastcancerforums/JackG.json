      "Content": "Hi I wonder if anyone has been in my situation. I had a 5cm tumour and spread to lymph nodes (5) I have just finished 6 rounds of FECT. My last MRI has shown the tumour has disappeared however the cancer is still in my nodes. I am gutted and terrified. I have a lumpectomy and full node removal in 3 weeks then 29 days of radiotherapy. I\u2019m now wishing I had the op first then the chemo. I\u2019m terrified that this will spread an feel that because it\u2019s being cut out with no follow up treatment (like cheno) I\u2019m now a higher risk. Any help would be greatly appreciated my minds doind overtime. Thanks. ",

I\u2019m so scared of it spreading they said they have shrunk so it\u2019s had a small reaction but not what I expected. I want off this rollercoaster lol . Good luck x",
