    "Content": "Hiya. I have gone through this. I also felt the last rhing I needed was a freezing head whilst having my treatment! So I didn't bother. It is one of the liweat points when the decision has to be made to zip if what's left of your hair, but I had some fab scarves that I tied with a big bow on the side and also it was nice to watch it grow back, like a 'new you'. The treatment on the day is fine, although finding a good vein, if not on a pick line is often unpleasant. The symptoms are horrid. But to cut this reply short, check out my Facebook page ' nutrition and food V cancer' lots of info there to relieve your symptoms. Make sure you get some 'oil pulling' oil, it will releave your mouth ulcers naturally better than anything else. There's a section on the page about it. Message me on there if you need too. Regards and good luck, lisa",
