    "Content": "Hi All I was diagnosed with breast cancer about 6 months ago. Unfortunately when I originally detected the lump 18 months ago the ultrasound was inconclusive and I was told it was a cluster of cysts.  One of the things that convinced me to return and request another referral for testing was that my breast had become misshapen and it was painful to lie on my stomach. I had also developed bruising. Since diagnosis I have started chemotherapy to shrink the tumour prior to surgery. However, I continue to notice that the breast is often bruised near the tumour, and the only thing I find when I search for bruising is information about inflammatory breast cancer (IBC). The consultants have not mentioned IBC and the centre I am attending is incredibly good so I assume if this was a possibility they would have done some tests or at least discussed it with me.  Am I being silly? Do others with palpable lumps also experience bruising? Any thoughts or experiences much appreciated. Thanks!",
