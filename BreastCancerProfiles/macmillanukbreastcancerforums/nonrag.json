Also dry skin and because I'm wearing a cap think that may be making it worse. What cream can I use on scalp? Is my head needing more air? Eyes really sore now too and runny nose gawd this is awful just now. Been reading others having this problem so will just have to grin and bear it.

I was bald on top and like a monk and knew I had to shave it for my own sanity but the hardest thing I've ever done. I had it shaved by the wig lady last Thursday and I was instantly relieved. I still haven't let anyone see my bald head even my hubby but I felt more in control after getting rid of it. Finding hair everywhere and all over clothes the floor etc  was really hard and don't have that now. I was losing the lot anyway. I had a free wig on the NHS too just ask at the hospital. It really look real but hard to get used to but O hope that changes with time. I still think people are staring. I got a great wee cap that is soft jersey and a nice style from suburban turban called a Kimmy. Fab and great service. Good luck and let us know how you get on!!! Morag xx",

Can anyone who has had this tell me why?  Is it painful etc,, dreading it I am trying to get things ready for mastectomy in advance in between chemos. I had read here before but can't find it about front opening pyjamas .I don't like trousers in bed. Can anyone recommend where to get a button through (not see through) not warm either as roasting in hospital nightshirt? Also a decent bedjacket?
