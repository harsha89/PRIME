      "Content": "Had my 1st of 4 cycles on Wednesday and seemed fine. I went into work for a few hours on Thursday and Friday then yesterday evening did the 1st of my immune boosting injections, within 2 hours in pain with joints and muscles.  Was in pain most of the night and took my temperature this morning as I was cold and clammy, it was 35.8 so called the emergency line and I ended up in hospital.  They have sent me home this afternoon with antibiotics as my levels are a little raised but did not seem to understand the joint and muscle pain but said I was in for a couple of rough days and to take paracetamol. Now really scared of the reaction I am going to have this evening when I do the injections again!! Help any advice",

      "Content": "Thanks for the reply, sorry yes mean't grade 3. Are you having radiotherapy as well?  I am glad to hear that you got through it without too many of the side effects, I will keep my fingers crossed that I am the same.  I was offered the cold cap to help avoid the hair loss that might happen but I thought the treatment sounded worse than losing my hair, which is the least of my worries at the moment.  I am hoping to work in between cycles but it really depends on the side effects that I get.  I have taken on board your comments and I am going to stock up on ice lollies, soup and eggs.  ",

      "Content": "Hi I am new to the forum and decided to post as the closer my chemo gets the more worried I get.  I was diagnosed stage 2 breast cancer and had surgery at the end of March to remove a 6mm lump and was told that afterwards I would need 15 sessions radiotherapy. I got my head around that and I knew that they were taking some nodes out to check as well.  When I went back for my results after surgery the good news was no lymph node involvement but then the bad news, the lump when removed had grown a lot to 25mm and after further tests on the breast tissue it was diagnosed stage 3 and I was positive for esterogen.  I was then told that they were sending off a tissue sample to the U.S. to find out if I was high risk which it turned out I am.  Now I having chemo as well, 4 sessions of cyclophosphamide and docetaxel. As I am already immune compromised I am having injections after each cycle for 5 days to help boost my immune system.  I was due to start chemo treatment this week but I have an infection in the cavity where the cancer was removed so now on strong antibiotics and chemo date moved to next Wednesday. It already feels like something is going wrong at every stage.  I am trying to stay positive and very busy but not always easy.  Is anyone else on the same treatment and how is it going?  Thanks Sue",
