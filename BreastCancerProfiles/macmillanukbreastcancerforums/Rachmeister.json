      "Content": "Hi Regency I was brand new on here 2 weeks ago with my own sudden out of the blue diagnosis of invasive breast cancer, facing a mastectomy and quite honestly all over the place.  Reading other people's posts and then having loads of replies to my first post a couple of days ago asking for help was just great and has grounded me and given me lots of hope for the future plus useful information about how things are going to look and feel.  I do hope you find some answers here like I have.   My mum also has cancer though a different sort and it has spread through her lymph system.  She is about to start chemo in a few weeks.  She feels quite different about her cancer and treatment to how I feel and she has different considerations about what she wants at her age.  I am guilty of seeing things through my eyes rather than hers.  Sometimes it is very hard though.  People on here will be with you whatever happens.  Big hugs Rachel",

      "Content": "Hi Andrea, I had a mastectomy and immediate reconstruction with implant on 22 March.  The best list of things to take to hospital is on the breast surgery / reconstruction sections of the Cancer Research UK website.  As for bras you will probably need a compression one to help the reconstruction.  Ask your BCN tomorrow what you should do about this.  My hospital provided me with 2 compression bras so I woke up in one (and I am still in it 24/7!).  It helps a lot.  If they don't provide one, the make I was given is Veronique and the style was Josephine if you are interested.  If you google Veronique bra you will find it for sale in the UK easily.  Eye mask and earplugs for my hospital stay were absolutely essential for sleep but you will be very tired from the general anaesthetic when you get home as well as the lack of sleep so my top tip is to be kind to yourself and sleep as much as you can.  I managed 12 hours sleep out of every 24 for the first 10 days.  Having a drain is a bit of a palaver but you get used to it quickly and it helps if you have a little cotton bag to put it into.  My drain was not removed for 12 days so no showers during this period.  Baby wipes are your friends.  Good luck and I hope all is well for you.

      "Content": "Hi Andrea, I got mine from drain dollies and I would be very happy to give it to you if you'd like it.  I can just post it to you today if you send me a PM with your address if you want it.  It has a long shoulder strap and very lightweight so just sits on your shoulder permanently (not crossed over to the other shoulder).  It meant that I could use my hands all the time without worrying about the drain and it even slept on the bed with me so I didn't accidentally pull the drain tube at night. My implant looks pretty good.  It is a tiny bit smaller and a bit perkier than its older sister but in a bra you can't tell the difference.  I wasn't able to keep my nipple so that took a little getting used to at first.  I was glad I had found a photo on the internet of what it would look like (5 inch horizontal scar across where the nipple used to be) because it helped me as to what to expect.  The implant is soft, there is a little droop like a real one, it's a bit denser than my other one, more like they used to be pre children!  My skin over the breast feels more or less the same, though the area under the arm pit, down the side of the breast and round the back of my upper arm is numb from the sentinel lymph node biopsy.  We are all individuals so you may or may not get any slight nerve damage here.  There is currently a bit of a seroma between the implant and the chest wall so it is swollen and a bit uncomfortable.  The compression bra is helping keep it at bay though I have had to had it drained once.  If the area swells up you may find you need a larger size bra and be careful obviously not to have any seams round the sides. Each surgeon seems to have their own protocol for drains.  Mine would not remove it until I was draining 50ml of fluid per day or less, which took 12 days.  The fluid started out looking like cloudy raspberry juice then got clearer, less red and started to go lighter in colour.  My drain was actually stitched in to stop it being pulled out accidentally and was underneath the breast.  It didn't hurt in the slightest to take it out though the feeling of the tube slowly coming out felt like something small slithering out of there and freaked my mind out for a while! It was a relief to have it out as I had been banned from showers because they told me that they were worried about potential infection at the drain exit site, which therefore had to be covered all the time.  The mastectomy site had glue stitches that I could see straight away when I woke up. Driving is also down to the individual but they told me it would be 2 to 3 weeks before I could drive and 6 weeks before I could start to do anything more strenuous.  I started doing short journeys at 2 weeks but then because of the seroma and more discomfort I cut down for a week.  Just started driving again now at nearly 4 weeks post op but taking it easy and not doing much.  You may be different but I still can't put much strength through my affected arm (left one) and cannot lift anything above a few pounds so driving isn't much fun even in an automatic car.  I have been told that compared to a mastectomy without implant reconstruction, I must do less with my left arm to allow the implant to stabilise and everything to heal.  For example they told me that it is really important to do the gentle exercises they gave you but the ones for reconstruction are even more gentle than without and I mustn't overdo it. I do hope all goes well for you tomorrow and in the days to come. Love Rachel ",

      "Content": "Hi Clarkie I think that a lot of the things you mention are fairly common. I had a left mastectomy and immediate recon with implant and mesh 10 weeks ago. After my drain came out at 12 days I got a lot of swelling with seroma under the breast and in the armpit and the new breast felt very tight especially where the mesh was and it was larger than the other one for several weeks.  There was also quite a bit of pain from where the drain had been and a vein became inflamed at the exit site.  I had the swelling drained once then toughed it out because putting my left arm above my head for 20 minutes whilst it was drained was too uncomfortable.  Because of the swelling I was told to stop all shoulder exercises by my surgeon and do as little as possible until 6 weeks post operation.  There appears to be no medical consensus as to whether no exercise is better or massage / exercise is better to help seroma swelling go down.  I think that 24/7 in a compression bra helped mine but I couldn't say whether no exercise did.  Giving it several weeks time to heal inside as it is a large surface area is probably the right answer. During this time I also tried to avoid pain killers after about 10 days and was roundly told off by my oncologist for being too hard on myself.  He told me to take anti inflammatories regularly as it would help. Around 8 weeks post operation my swelling had started to settle down, though the breast still felt very high on my chest and the mesh underneath was still tight and uncomfortable, especially at the side and in the cleavage emd.  A week later the glue over the stitches finally came off in the middle of the scar revealing a tiny hole where the skin hadn't healed.  I therefore had to have revision surgery last week and now have an expander in.  I have swollen up again (the drain came out at 4 days this time) but not as bad this time.  What has changed is that the surgeon has adjusted the tightness of the mesh and the whole thing is much less tight than it was before and hangs lower or more naturally shaped much to my relief.  I wouldn't have known that it is possible to correct over tight reconstruction without my second surgeon noticing and just doing it for me as part of the revision surgery.  If yours is still tight and sore in the future it is worth getting it checked out.   Good luck and hope you heal well. It takes longer than we would all like it to..... Rachel",

      "Content": "I had a left mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy plus immediate reconstruction with an implant and mesh on March 22 this year and it had finally started to settle down in terms of pain and swelling in the breast and strength and movement of my shoulder about 2 weeks ago.  Unfortunately at the same time the last piece of the glue stitches came off the middle of my scar to reveal a small dark area that has turned out to be the actual implant showing through (yuk!).  The little round hole got a bit bigger and started leaking serous fluid, but is not infected.  Three doctors have looked at it so far.  The bad news is that I will now definitely lose the implant because of the breakdown of the skin in the most stretched area of the MX scar.  However, there is a possibility that the surgeon can flush out the whole area and either insert another possibly smaller implant or a temporary expander in there and put in a new mesh impregnated with antibiotics to try to prevent infection.  The other choice is to go flat now and forget about it all for a while, possibly revisit in the future.  I always felt quite strongly that I didn't want to go flat but I am very active and the thought of not being able to ride, drive, muck out, work on the farm etc for quite a while again is driving me nuts as I had just about been able to do everything again albeit I am now very unfit. Has anyone had immediate revision surgery on a failed implant with either another implant or a temporary expander and was it successful?  How long did it take you to heal from this surgery given it takes about 6 weeks to recover from a mastectomy and immediate recon? Has anyone just decided to go flat at this point and did you feel ok given that initially you wanted a reconstruction?  What questions do I ask the surgeon (I am seeing him for again on Tuesday)? I am really not sure whether to try again right now or to call it quits.  I am so looking forward to having a drain again .... ",

It is smaller and a better match with the real one even though it is not yet much expanded and it is healing up well. The surgeon adjusted the tightness of the ADM underneath and that is a huge relief.  I hadn't realised that it was so tight and high up before to the point of uncomfortable and therefore I think the whole thing happened for the right reasons.   The area where the port has gone in is a bit sore and I'm going through a bra crisis as I can't get anything to feel comfortable even after removing all underwires from old sports bras but this is a minor inconvenience I hope.  I hope it all settles down properly this time but definitely felt much more comfortable with a different surgeon.",

      "Content": "Hi everyone, I was diagnosed a couple of weeks ago with two small grade 2 occult areas in different quadrants of my left breast, so given no choice but to have a mastectomy.  I am ER+ 8/8 and HER2 negative.  I have opted for an immediate implant reconstruction, though I have plenty of worries as to what this will entail - I definitely don't want to use my own tissue due to recovery time / potentially losing strength, as I am very active and lift heavy things and ride horses a lot.  However, I'm 25 lbs over weight and not got small breasts so I am also worrying about that. The operation is scheduled for 22 March and I am trying not to get too anxious in advance but not always succeeding.  My BCN is very good but I would also like information from people who have actually gone through this. I am worried about the pain afterwards and how long it lasts.  I can take paracetamol based drugs but no NSAIDS at all as I also have a heart condition - atrial fibrillation - that started last December.  I have no idea what I will be able to do and when post the operation, though I will follow orders from the hospital about not doing too much.  When was the first time post op that people felt up to going outside for a walk or even going out to see people?  When did you manage to drive?  I live in a very rural area so there is no shop or any other facility in walking distance!   I think that I have got everything packed in my hospital bag (staying in 2 nights) and felt sad that the last time I packed a bag for hospital was for the birth of my children (18 and 16).  Any tips for anything I am missing?  I have packed: eye mask earplugs front opening tops / pyjamas (had to buy these as didn't have anything, weird experience!) dressing gown slippers iphone and charger kindle toiletries including lip balm and sore throat sweets Do I need any special cream for the wound?   What happens about bras after a implant reconstruction?  I have got a call in to my BCN but not heard back from her. Sorry for so many questions.  I am the sort of person that likes lots and lots of information that I can then ponder and work out whether it applies to me or not so please let me have your responses, positive and (hopefully to too) negative.

      "Content": "Thanks Carolyn, some useful stuff but I rather resent being called a \"fidget bottom\" to be honest!  That is really rather judgemental and we are not on here to be that are we? The surgeon thinks the rest of me has healed amazingly (I heal quickly) and there is nothing I could have done or not done to prevent the scar not healing properly.  This is good because I do not need to blame myself at all for it not healing.  I had to lose my nipple because the cancer was right behind it so the skin there is very stretched and thin over the implant.  I have followed all instructions for rest etc and didn't do anything for a full 6 weeks, even going back to the surgeon to get signed off before I did anything at all because it was important to me but horses and outdoor things are now my full time job and life (I was a high level international lawyer for decades previously).  I have taken advice from a friend who is a nutritionist so all is now well there too.  I am not stressed either, so as I have said, I am not the cause of the thing not healing. I will ask the surgeon whether I should have a break or not but as I don't need chemo or radio only hormone therapy and I am very well in myself I suspect that they will say no or only for emotional reasons.  I am not going to try an autologous reconstruction as it would take too long to heal and potentially compromise strength as you will have guessed.

They've told me that the incisions on the breast area are going to be covered by waterproof dressing but the drain sites not so it will be dry shampoo and sit down baths once I have worked out how to manoevre into and out of it.  I have got plenty of (non-matching) pants packed too!. The AF is a bit of a nightmare in conjunction with the cancer as it already makes me pretty tired by evening though I am tolerating it with various meds quite well.  Since BC diagnosis, I have been even more tired in the evenings due to the emotional strain, but amazingly I have been sleeping a solid 8 hours + per night.  I have been on Dabigatran, a NOAC (new anti-coagulant) until a second biopsy a couple of weeks ago when my cardiologist told me to stop it and not restart until any chemo is over as the meds can interact.  I am also likely to be on an anti-coagulant for the rest of my life, oh joy.  I have had 2 cardioversions in January this year, one worked for 3 days and I felt like skipping about during that period, it was that much better and then the second one didn't last for longer than a minute and they zapped me good n hard 3 times. My only option now is catheter ablation once I have dealt with the cancer.  It will be a walk in the park after this surgery and subsequent treatment I expect.....

Oh good, I thought!  I would love to be back in normal sinus rhythm one of these days....Yours seems to have worked very well, which is brilliant.  It takes a while to understand what triggers attacks and avoid those triggers.  My main ones are alcohol, caffeine, chilli and chocolate (drat!).  I hope you stay in NSR.

      "Content": "Hi Gay, thank you very much for your reply, which was useful.  I am having a sentinel nodes biopsy rather than full clearance at this stage.  Dry shampoo is a great idea and I will take some moisturiser as well.  My BCN has just phoned and told me that they will give me a post surgical bra that sounds more like a corset that I will have to wear for 6 weeks and that the drains may be there for 9 to 12 days.  Good job I have ordered a drain dollie I think!  Thanks again.  Rachel",

      "Content": "Hi Andrea I am now 6 weeks exactly since my left side mastectomy and reconstruction with an implant and I understand you completely when you say you don't know what normal is.  We only find out as we go along plus we are all a bit different.  I found talking to the BCN helpful but she did say \"that's normal\" to everything I mentioned.   I have had quite a lot of pain from seroma between weeks 2.5 to 4.5 but then it started to go down.  The pain was mainly underneath and to the inside of the breast and it was quite red, plus various feelings to discomfort in armpit and shoulder.  At 6 weeks it has now really started to settle down and I am getting some strength back in my arm though the implant gets very tight by the end of each evening so still some way to go.  Resting and not doing too much is probably the answer - I got told off for doing a bit too much (and I thought I wasn't actually doing anything really!) but as soon as I stopped the seroma and accompanying pain started to reduce. Good luck for the results - make sure you ask for a copy of the pathology report on the spot so you can re-read it as it can be a lot to take in at the time.  Ask about the possibility of having the oncotype dx test on a tissue sample if you have no lymph node involvement.  Rachel x",

      "Content": "Hello Terry I hope everything goes well for your wife.  I have had two core biopsies a week apart in late Feb / early March this year after a routine mammogram.  I am not going to lie to you - the first one hurt quite a bit at the time because it was very close to the nipple and I was very tense about the whole thing.  (This area turned out to have a lot of cancer in it too).  It was fine after a few hours and some painkillers and there was a small bruise and some tenderness for a couple of weeks afterwards.  The second one I didn't feel anything at all, partly because it was in a less sensitive area but partly because I took a strong painkiller (paracetamol and codeine) an hour before the biopsy so I was a bit away with the fairies anyway.  I would definitely recommend that your wife takes a good dose of pain killer beforehand as it will help.  All the best.

      "Content": "Thank you Nicky, sorry I didn't spot the date and great that you are doing well now.  I hadn't really appreciated that recovery is not linear but comes in fits and starts (plus a bit of going backwards where seromas are concerned).  I have had a little neural pain but not much, though when I get it I shout suddenly and without warning, so its not good!  Most of the skin still has normal feeling left though, which is fortunate.  My implant is under the muscle so I am jolly well hoping that jiggling about is kept to a minimum especially when I get back on my horse.   I hope your recovery continues as well as it can.

      "Content": "Hi Nicky, I had a left side mastectomy with pig skin strattice immediate reconstruction on 22 March 2017 so nearly 3 weeks ago.  I am very active (horses, farm etc) age 52 so just did not want to go for an autologous recon as the recovery time would be a lot longer.  I use my shoulders and chest muscles a lot so thought very carefully about the impact.  I expect to get full strength back though there is of course the risk of lymphodoema long term (I also had a SNB as part of the procedure and fortunately don't need any more modes taken out).  It is very much an individual decision though.   The new boob (\"Betty\") has a long horizontal scar across it (I was not able to keep my own nipple) but otherwise is just about the same size and shape in a (24/7 compression) bra as the other one.  It is perkier however, noticeable out of the bra and lying down.  I will decide in due course whether I want a nipple tattooed on it (I don't fancy other sorts of fake nipple).  It also feels quite soft, and there is a sort of natural droop to it because of the strattice support and husband appears to like it. The side of the boob into the armpit is exactly the same as it used to be and no dog ears whatsoever.   It is not like having an alien strapped to my chest so far.  I have just developed a seroma under it in the dead space between the chest wall and the implant that will either have to be drained or will go away over the next 6 months so it is now rather larger than its older sister.  I had to have a drain in for 12 days post surgery which was a bit of a nuisance but kept the swelling at bay.  I took paracetamol and codeine for 3 days post operation then just normal paracetamol for another 7 days and very little since day 10 though it is permanently slightly uncomfortable and sore, plus now tight from the seroma. I would recommend this from my own experience.  Try to find some photos of what it might look like, especially if you're not able to save your own nipples.  I found it very helpful to get my head round what it would look like beforehand and it helped me to see a nipple free recon breast with a horizontal scar to prepare me in advance. Happy to share anything else with you if you'd like.  Good luck with your decision. Rachel ",
