      "Content": "Have had my breast cancer removed and am discussing preventative treatment with my Oncologist. He has used a database to predict whether I need chemo or not. The results have come out at a 5% chance that it would be helpful. Apparently if it comes out at 4% or under they do not recommend chemo due to the risks involved. As it has come out at 5% they have left the decision as to whether I have chemo or not to me. Has anyone else been i this position? What did you do? Do you have any advice? Thanks  ",

      "Content": "Hi Alison,    thank you so much for your reply which I found really helpful. as it turned out although the lymph nodes were clear the cancer had \"invaded\" my blood vessels at an early stage. I understand there isn't the equivalent of a lymph node for a blood vessel to take out and see if it has gone further so I'm going to elect for chemo. will have radiotherapy at the end and then 5 years of tablets, I think they are still deciding which as at 52 I'm only partially through the change. my gp also suggested a flu jab to build up my immunity which I will have before starting chemo, don't know if this would be of use to anyone else but I thought I'd mention it in case,   Best Wishes ",
