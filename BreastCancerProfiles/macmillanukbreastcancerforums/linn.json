As far as I know chemo isn't used to treat Dcis, it would only be needed if an invasive cancer was found. I had a lumpectomy and 20 sessions of radiation and now a year on I'm doing good, but I remember how frightened I was at the start so afraid.let us know how you get on what's the next step for you.",

I had good support from my family friends and my work were fantastic, I returned to work recently and I'm all good and back to normal.Thank God for modern medicine,or it may have been a very different story. For anyone who's had a diagnosis recently or going through treatment try to think positive and get through the days, weeks and months, cause before you know it you'll be like me a year out and amazed by how strong you actually are, hugs to all.",
