    "Content": "Hi Mica, You sound so much like my son and daughter, they worried for me as well. Like your Mum I too had to have chemo.  I started six sessions of it in February and finished on 21st May. I used the cold cap..my hair thinned a bit but it was on top and I used a product from Boots called toppex that hides any thinning spots..it's been a godsend. Chemo isn't a walk in the park but it is doable. I work in a family guest house cleaning rooms etc and apart from the days I had chemo I worked every day. Just finished radiotherapy and that has been fine, no problems..worked in the mornings and did hospital appointments in the afternoons.  With the chemo the anti sickness drugs they give are brilliant..only slightly sick one morning first thing a few days after the first session but that was probably my fault for not taking one of the tablets the night before.  The thing that upset me the most was I lost my sense of taste a lot of the time but that does return. I'm sure your Mum will be fine too. Take care",
