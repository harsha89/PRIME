      "Content": "Hope you all managed to have a relaxing Christmas. I had pertuzumab, Docetaxel,carboplatin and herceptin on 18th. The first couple of days I felt ok. Day 3 I had blurred vision a heart rate of 49 and BP 117/57. I am on medication for high blood pressure and sinus tachycardia. The chemo triage suggested I ring my GP. I have now come off 2 of my bp meds but still taking bisoprilol. Thankfully my BP and heart rate have stabilised. Wondering if  the herceptin lowered my BP. Christmas Day my mouth became sore and I started with the runs.i phoned the chemo triage team again on Boxing Day who suggested I ring 111. After a visit to Out of hours GP I have Nystan as I have oral thrush. No appetite for anything. Food I do manage has no taste. I haven\u2019t been able to enjoy a cup of tea for days. My tummy is still not right. I am taking a few of the anti runs tablets a day. Please tell me the next cycle will be better( 9th Jan)  On the plus side we have signed up to rent a beachside apartment for 6 months. All I need to bring with me is a suitcase of clothes. It\u2019s on the ground floor as opposed to where I am now with 2 flights of stairs. Xx",
