      "Content": "Thanks Melissa Your email was really helpful. I did not know that chemo had an effect on scars and will definately bear that in mind when making my decision. It is good to hear your views as I have been offered similar surgery. I am sorry you have been through such a hard time though. I hope things get better for you. I do have a breast nurse but they won't put me in touch with people until I have made my mind as to what I want. I am going to check out local support groups. I am going to look up the surgeon and see if I can see some pictures, I have looked at the ones on this site. How soon did you have chemo? What drugs were/ are you on and for how long? If you had the choice just to have chemo and radio therepy would you have chosen this instead? Thanks for your information it has been really helpful and I wish you all the best. Sam x",

      "Content": "Hi ktb Thanks for your message, it is odd how many different options are given to people as you have had what I was told I would have before my surgery. How big was your tumor? We are similar in age so it can't be to do with that and mine was grade 2, so I don't understand why I need more stuff!!! Did you have any chemo etc? Thanks again for your messge and take care sam x",

      "Content": "Thanks to everyone that left me a reply to my message. I am due to see my oncologist on Tuesday and have loads of questions for him which will help me to gain a better understanding of what is going on. I also have spoken to someone via Peer support offered by Breast Cancer Care who was amazing and really helped me to learn more about what was going on and what had happened to her. She gives talks at Breast Cancer Care events and was so helpful, I would recommend them to anyone. I also have an appointment to see the plastic surgeon a week on Monday and so should then be able to make a clear and informed decision but I am now thinkins that mastectomy is the way forward for me. Thank you all so much for you help and support it has been really useful and I wish you all the best for the future. I am sure I will be on with more questions followng my appointments!! Sam xx",

      "Content": "Hi I have recently been diagnosed with breast cancer and had a wide local excision with sentinal lymph node biopsy nearly 2 weeks ago. At the first appointment I was told that if they managed to get the whole lump and the nodes were clear I may not need any more treatment. However if it was invasive or had spread to the nodes I would need a masectomy but with no follow up treatment. I saw my consultant last week and my lump was 38 mm and grade 2 and they are now saying I should have a masectomy even though there is no sign of any cancer in the rest of the breast. There are some areas where they don't know what is happening though but nothing showed up on the mamogram etc. It has not spread to the nodes which is good. I have therefore been offered a masectomy with reconstruction straight away followed by chemo or just chemo and radio therapy. I am 42 and don't really want to have a masectomy, my hopsital won't put me in touch with people that have had the reconstructions I have been offered until I have chosen which I want, either the muscle from the back moved round or fat from my stomach moved and the blood vessels joined up. It all seems wrong that I am not being given full information to make an informed decision. I am also worried about them suggesting a mesectomy to cover themselves if it comes back in the future. Can anyone offer any advice, guidence or details of where to go to get the information I need? Thanks Sam",
