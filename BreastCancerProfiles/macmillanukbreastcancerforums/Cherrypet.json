    "Content": "Hello, this is my first visit to the group. I was treated for breast cancer in 2011 Chemo, lumpectomy, radiotherapy followed by Herceptin.  I have now coped with lymphodema for a couple of years. I always wear my sleeve and do my drainage exercises. In the last ten days I have felt there is itching in the numb area under my arm.  I noticed today there is be swelling in the site of the lumpectomy. The scar area is usually quite a 'dent' in my breast but I noticed today the area is no longer 'dented'. It is swollen back to the way it used to be. I wondered if anyone else had experienced this and if it is the result of not doing my drainage exercises  adequately? Feedback would be much appreciated.",
