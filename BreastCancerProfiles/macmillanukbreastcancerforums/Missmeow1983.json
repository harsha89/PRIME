    "Content": "Hi everyone, So i get my results back tomorrow following on from a mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy on 20th August. I'm absolutely sh#@ing myself and I'm convinced it's spread.  Reason being i found another lump in the week after being diagnosed.  Well i say lump but, it was really like a piece of rope from my lump up into my arm pit.  I don't remember this being there when i was diagnosed. I didn't say anything to my surgeon out of stupidity because i was too scared.  Anyway the rope/cord like lump is no longer there but I'm so worried it was a lymph node swollen because of cancer cells. It's my dads 60th on 10th and when i asked him what he wanted he said 'All i want is for you to be clear on the 6th' What if i can't? If it has spread, will i know how badly tomorrow or will i have to wait for endless tests to be done and another few weeks of worrying? I'm literally shaking with fear.",
