    "Content": "I was on Tamoxifen for 7 weeks before I was taken off them. I didn't have huge side effects either.  I got hot flushes which were so mild and like you, I didn't even know it!  I did start to retain water and got short of breath, sore joints and sore legs. My GP sent me for a chest scan and it seems I got fluid on the lungs from them because of the water retention so I was taken off the drug.  My joints don't hurt anymore and neither do my legs. I only had the choice of chemo so I turned that down and chose a healthy lifestyle instead.  If they find another tumour I'll do chemo but otherwise it would be overkill for me.",
