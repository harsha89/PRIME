    "Content": "Hi,  I've returned to work recently (December 5th 2015) after having nearly 18 months off! I've returned as part of a phased return, beginning with only 2 half days a week! And since returning I've taken many days off due to health and bank holidays etc. Also since the last 2 weeks I am off again due to an infection. But my employee has been very understanding possible due to a Macmillan nurse being present during the return to work meeting.  I would 100% recommend you speak to someone at Macmillan and get them to speak to your employer. I hope everything works out for you in the end. Xx",
