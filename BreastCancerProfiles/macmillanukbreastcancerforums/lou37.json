      "Content": "Hello I just wanted to say thank you for all the advice on this thread as it really helped me prepare for what to expect and the practical side of things like how to dress! I am 9 days after the op and feeling good still a little sore on the tissue expander side but the mastectomy straight to implant side is fantastic and I have little pain. Hal53 I had my right mastectomy in Sept last year and have had the tissue expander fitted 13th June, at the same time I have had a right mastectomy straight to implant. After my diagnosis I wanted the mastectomy as soon as possible to then give myself time to decided on any further treatment, which I didn't need in the end, but I was able to take my time and explore all options of reconstruction. So far I am very happy with the implant, the tissue expander looks different obviously... i have to put trust in my surgeon!  xxx",

      "Content": "Hi I was diagnosed with DCIS in my right breast and had a mastectomy last September. Next week I am having a tissue expander fitted. Has anyone got any advice on how this will feel after the surgery and what I can expect?  In the same surgery I have opted to have my left breast removed and immediate reconstruction with an implant. I am negative for the BRCA gene but have chosen to do this as my hormones were negative and I want to do as much as I can to prevent. Has anyone got advice on recovery after a mastectomy with immediate implant reconstruction?  Thank you",

      "Content": "Hi I didn't have radiotherapy so i'm not sure on the advice, although the quality of the skin is looked at before they allow an implant.  So far the tissue expander is ok. A little uncomfortable but not too bad. I have my first fill on Monday so I will soon know how that feels.  I opted against the breast reduction and had a mastectomy with implant. I also had the jitters on the decision and the week before the op I was all over the place, prior to making the decision I did have counciling and I found it helpful to write down my reasons and I went back to this when I was questioning the decision.  So far the op has felt ok. Pain is manageable and really it was only the first few days that were difficult. I am now just over 3 weeks on and I am happy with what I see.  Lou x",
