I have my appointment to go back...my consultant is hoping to set up another MRI in between and I have to go see the respiratory clinic to rule out the lungs at some point. I really hope it goes well for you next week, I will keep my fingers crossed! Let us know how you get on won't you? Very best of luck xxx",
